<div class="col-md-10">
<p style="text-align:justify">1. Whereas reasons of the security of 2[Bangladesh] occasionally render it necessary to place under personal restraint individuals against whom there may not be sufficient ground to institute any judicial proceeding, or when such proceeding may not be adapted to the nature of the case, or may for other reasons be unadvisable or improper;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">and whereas it is fit that, in every case of the nature herein referred to the determination to be taken should proceed immediately from the authority of the Government;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">and whereas the ends of justice required that, when it may be determined that any person shall be placed under personal restraint, otherwise than in pursuance of some judicial proceeding, the grounds of such determination should from time to time come under revision, and the person affected thereby should at all times be allowed freely to bring to the notice of the Government all circumstances relating either to the supposed grounds of such determination, or to the manner in which it may be executed;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">and whereas the ends of justice also require that due attention be paid to the health of every State prisoner confined under this Regulation, and that suitable provision be made for his support according to his rank in life, and to his own wants and those of his family;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">and whereas the reasons above declared sometimes render it necessary that the estates and lands of zamindars, talukdars and others should be attached and placed under the temporary management of the Revenue Authorities without having recourse to any judicial proceeding;</p>
<p>and whereas it is desirable to make such legal provisions as may secure from injury the just rights and interests of individuals whose estates may be so attached under the direct authority of the Government;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Provided that a person shall not be placed under personal restraint for a period longer than two months without the authority of a Board consisting of a Judge of the Supreme Court, who shall be nominated by the Chief Justice of that Court, and another senior officer in the service of <span class="footnote" no.="" of="" order="" s="" title='The word "Bangladesh" was substituted for the word "Pakistan" by Article 5 of the Bangladesh (Adaptation of Existing Lows) order, 1972 (President'><span class="word-formet"><sup class="en"><a href="1">2</a></sup></span></span>[Bangladesh], who shall be nominated by the President.</p>
