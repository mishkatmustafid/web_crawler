<p>six sigma: a framework for total quality management</p>
<p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</b></p>
<p>This paper introduces Six Sigma as a quality improvement initiative and quality management framework. The motivation for Six Sigma, as well as the scheme for its implementation, is outlined. Although the strength of Six Sigma lies in its deployment of statistical tools and the application of statistical thinking, the features of Six Sigma are highlighted in a non-technical language in this paper. Some comments are also given on the requisites for the effectiveness of Six Sigma at the organizational level<i>.</i></p>
<p><b>What is Six Sigma?</b></p>
<p>Six Sigma is a business management strategy originally developed by Motorola, USA in 1986. As of 2010<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Six_Sigma&amp;action=edit"">[update]</a></sup>, it is widely used in many sectors of industry, although its use is not without controversy.</p>
<p>Six Sigma seeks to improve the quality of process outputs by identifying and removing the causes of defects (errors) and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes. It uses a set of quality management methods, including statistical methods, and creates a special infrastructure of people within the organization (“Black Belts”, “Green Belts”, etc.) who are experts in these methods. Each Six Sigma project carried out within an organization follows a defined sequence of steps and has quantified financial targets (cost reduction or profit increase).</p>
<p>The term six sigma originated from terminology associated with manufacturing, specifically terms associated with statistical modeling of manufacturing processes. The maturity of a manufacturing process can be described by a sigma rating indicating its yield, or the percentage of defect-free products it creates. A six-sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of the products manufactured are statistically expected to be free of defects (3.4 defects per million). Motorola set a goal of “six sigma” for all of its manufacturing operations, and this goal became a byword for the management and engineering practices used to achieve it.</p>
<p><b>Why is Six Sigma</b></p>
<p>l Intense competitive pressures – especially from rapid globalization.</p>
<p>l Greater consumer demand for high quality products and services, little tolerance for failures of any type.</p>
<p>l Top management (and stockholder) recognition of the high costs of poor quality.</p>
<p>l The availability and accessibility of large data bases and the increasing ability to explore, understand, and use the data.</p>
<p><b>Historical Overview</b></p>
<p>Six Sigma originated as a set of practices designed to improve manufacturing processes and eliminate defects, but its application was subsequently extended to other types of business processes as well. In Six Sigma, a defect is defined as any process output that does not meet customer specifications, or that could lead to creating an output that does not meet customer specifications.</p>
<p>Bill Smith first formulated the particulars of the methodology at Motorola in 1986. Six Sigma was heavily inspired by six preceding decades of quality improvement methodologies such as quality control, TQM, and Zero Defects, based on the work of pioneers such as Shewhart, Deming, Juran, Ishikawa, Taguchi and others.</p>
<p>Like its predecessors, Six Sigma doctrine asserts that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous efforts to achieve stable and predictable process results (i.e., reduce process variation) are of vital importance to business success.</li>
<li>Manufacturing and business processes have characteristics that can be measured, analyzed, improved and controlled.</li>
<li>Achieving sustained quality improvement requires commitment from the entire organization, particularly from top-level management.</li>
</ul>
<p>Features that set Six Sigma apart from previous quality improvement initiatives include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clear focus on achieving measurable and quantifiable financial returns from any Six Sigma project.</li>
<li>An increased emphasis on strong and passionate management leadership and support.</li>
<li>A special infrastructure of “Champions,” “Master Black Belts,” “Black Belts,” “Green Belts”, etc. to lead and implement the Six Sigma approach.</li>
<li>A clear commitment to making decisions on the basis of verifiable data, rather than assumptions and guesswork.</li>
</ul>
<p>The term “Six Sigma” comes from a field of statistics known as process capability studies. Originally, it referred to the ability of manufacturing processes to produce a very high proportion of output within specification. Processes that operate with “six sigma quality” over the short term are assumed to produce long-term defect levels below 3.4 defects per million opportunities (DPMO). Six Sigma’s implicit goal is to improve all processes to that level of quality or better.</p>
<p>Six Sigma is a registered service mark and trademark of Motorola Inc. As of 2006<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Six_Sigma&amp;action=edit"">[update]</a></sup> Motorola reported over US$17 billion in savings from Six Sigma.</p>
<p>Other early adopters of Six Sigma who achieved well-publicized success include Honeywell (previously known as AlliedSignal) and General Electric, where Jack Welch introduced the method. By the late 1990s, about two-thirds of the Fortune 500</p>
<p>organizations had begun Six Sigma initiatives with the aim of reducing costs and improving quality.</p>
<p>In recent years<sup>[update]</sup>, some practitioners have combined Six Sigma ideas with lean manufacturing to yield a methodology named Lean Six Sigma.</p>
<p><b>Six Sigma Methods</b></p>
<p>Six Sigma projects follow two project methodologies inspired by Deming‘s Plan-Do-Check-Act Cycle. These methodologies, composed of five phases each, bear the acronyms DMAIC and DMADV.</p>
<ul>
<li>DMAIC is used for projects aimed at improving an existing business process.</li>
<li>DMADV is used for projects aimed at creating new product or process designs.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>DMAIC</b></p>
<p>The DMAIC project methodology has five phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define the problem, the voice of the customer, and the project goals, specifically.</li>
<li>Measure key aspects of the current process and collect relevant data.</li>
<li>Analyze the data to investigate and verify cause-and-effect relationships. Determine what the relationships are, and attempt to ensure that all factors have been considered. Seek out root cause of the defect under investigation.</li>
<li>Improve or optimize the current process based upon data analysis using techniques such as design of experiments, poka yoke or mistake proofing, and standard work to create a new, future state process. Set up pilot runs to establish process capability.</li>
<li>Control the future state process to ensure that any deviations from target are corrected before they result in defects. Implement control systems such as statistical process control, production boards, and visual workplaces, and continuously monitor the process.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>DMADV or DFSS</b></p>
<p>The DMADV project methodology, also known as DFSS (“Design For Six Sigma”) features five phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define design goals that are consistent with customer demands and the enterprise strategy.</li>
<li>Measure and identify CTQs (characteristics that are Critical To Quality), product capabilities, production process capability, and risks.</li>
<li>Analyze to develop and design alternatives, create a high-level design and evaluate design capability to select the best design.</li>
<li>Design details, optimize the design, and plan for design verification. This phase may require simulations.</li>
<li>Verify the design, set up pilot runs, implement the production process and hand it over to the process owner(s).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Tools and methods used in Six Sigma</b></p>
<p>Within the individual phases of a DMAIC or DMADV project, Six Sigma utilizes many established quality-management tools that are also used outside of Six Sigma. The following table shows an overview of the main methods used.</p>

<h2>Implementation roles</h2>
<p>One key innovation of Six Sigma involves the “professionalizing” of quality management functions. Prior to Six Sigma, quality management in practice was largely relegated to the production floor and to statisticians in a separate quality department. Formal Six Sigma programs borrow martial arts ranking terminology to define a hierarchy (and career path) that cuts across all business functions.</p>
<p>Six Sigma identifies several key roles for its successful implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Executive Leadership includes the CEO and other members of top management. They are responsible for setting up a vision for Six Sigma implementation. They also empower the other role holders with the freedom and resources to explore new ideas for breakthrough improvements.</li>
<li>Champions take responsibility for Six Sigma implementation across the organization in an integrated manner. The Executive Leadership draws them from upper management. Champions also act as mentors to Black Belts.</li>
<li>Master Black Belts, identified by champions, act as in-house coaches on Six Sigma. They devote 100% of their time to Six Sigma. They assist champions and guide Black Belts and Green Belts. Apart from statistical tasks, they spend their time on ensuring consistent application of Six Sigma across various functions and departments.</li>
<li>Black Belts operate under Master Black Belts to apply Six Sigma methodology to specific projects. They devote 100% of their time to Six Sigma. They primarily focus on Six Sigma project execution, whereas Champions and Master Black Belts focus on identifying projects/functions for Six Sigma.</li>
<li>Green Belts are the employees who take up Six Sigma implementation along with their other job responsibilities, operating under the guidance of Black Belts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some organizations use additional belt colours, such as Yellow Belts, for employees that have basic training in Six Sigma tools.</p>
<h3>Certification</h3>
<p>In the United States, Six Sigma certification for both Green and Black Belts is offered by the Institute of Industrial Engineers and by the American Society for Quality.</p>
<p>In addition to these examples, there are many other organizations and companies that offer certification. There currently is no central certification body, either in the United States or anywhere else in the world.</p>
<h2>Origin and meaning of the term “six sigma process”</h2>
<p>Graph of the normal distribution, which underlies the statistical assumptions of the Six Sigma model. The Greek letter ? (sigma) marks the distance on the horizontal axis between the mean, µ, and the curve’s inflection point. The greater this distance, the greater is the spread of values encountered. For the curve shown above, µ = 0 and ? = 1. The upper and lower specification limits (USL, LSL) are at a distance of 6? from the mean. Because of the properties of the normal distribution, values lying that far away from the mean are extremely unlikely. Even if the mean were to move right or left by 1.5? at some point in the future (1.5 sigma shift), there is still a good safety cushion. This is why Six Sigma aims to have processes where the mean is at least 6? away from the nearest specification limit.</p>
<p>The term “six sigma process” comes from the notion that if one has six standard deviations between the process mean and the nearest specification limit, as shown in the graph, practically no items will fail to meet specifications. This is based on the calculation method employed in process capability studies.</p>
<p>Capability studies measure the number of standard deviations between the process mean and the nearest specification limit in sigma units. As process standard deviation goes up, or the mean of the process moves away from the center of the tolerance, fewer standard deviations will fit between the mean and the nearest specification limit, decreasing the sigma number and increasing the likelihood of items outside specification.</p>
<h3>Role of the 1.5 sigma shift</h3>
<p>Experience has shown that processes usually do not perform as well in the long term as they do in the short term. As a result, the number of sigmas that will fit between the process mean and the nearest specification limit may well drop over time, compared to an initial short-term study. To account for this real-life increase in process variation over time, an empirically-based 1.5 sigma shift is introduced into the calculation. According to this idea, a process that fits six sigmas between the process mean and the nearest specification limit in a short-term study will in the long term only fit 4.5 sigmas – either because the process mean will move over time, or because the long-term standard deviation of the process will be greater than that observed in the short term, or both.</p>
<p>Hence the widely accepted definition of a six sigma process as one that produces 3.4 defective parts per million opportunities(DPMO). This is based on the fact that a process that is normally distributed will have 3.4 parts per million beyond a point that is 4.5 standard deviations above or below the mean (one-sided capability study). So the 3.4 DPMO of a “Six Sigma” process in fact corresponds to 4.5 sigmas, namely 6 sigmas minus the 1.5 sigma shift introduced to account for long-term variation. This takes account of special causes that may cause a deterioration in process performance over time and is designed to prevent underestimation of the defect levels likely to be encountered in real-life operation.</p>
<p><b>Sigma levels</b></p>
<p>A control chart depicting a process that experienced a 1.5 sigma drift in the process mean toward the upper specification limit starting at midnight. Control charts are used to maintain 6 sigma quality by signaling when quality professionals should investigate a process to find and eliminate special-cause variation.</p>
<p>The table below gives long-term DPMO values corresponding to various short-term sigma levels.</p>
<p>Note that these figures assume that the process mean will shift by 1.5 sigma toward the side with the critical specification limit. In other words, they assume that after the initial study determining the short-term sigma level, the long-term C<sub>pk</sub> value will turn out to be 0.5 less than the short-term C<sub>pk</sub> value. So, for example, the DPMO figure given for 1 sigma assumes that the long-term process mean will be 0.5 sigma beyond the specification limit (C<sub>pk</sub> = –0.17), rather than 1 sigma within it, as it was in the short-term study (C<sub>pk</sub> = 0.33). Note that the defect percentages only indicate defects exceeding the specification limit to which the process mean is nearest. Defects beyond the far specification limit are not included in the percentages.</p>

<p><b>Software used for Six Sigma</b></p>
<p>There are generally four classes of software used to support Six Sigma:</p>
<p>Ø Analysis tools, which are used to perform statistical or process analysis.</p>
<p>Ø Program management tools, used to manage and track a corporation’s entire Six Sigma program</p>
<p>Ø DMAIC and Lean online project collaboration tools for local and global teams.</p>
<p>Ø Data Collection tools that feed information directly into the analysis tools and significantly reduce the time spent gathering data</p>
<p><b>Application</b></p>
<p>Six Sigma mostly finds application in large organizations. An important factor in the spread of Six Sigma was GE’s 1998 announcement of $350 million in savings thanks to Six Sigma, a figure that later grew to more than $1 billion. According to industry consultants like Thomas Pyzdek and John Kullmann, companies with less than 500 employees are less suited to Six Sigma implementation, or need to adapt the standard approach to make it work for them. This is due both to the infrastructure of Black Belts that Six Sigma requires, and to the fact that large organizations present more opportunities for the kinds of improvements Six Sigma is suited to bringing about.</p>
<p><b>Advantages</b></p>
<p>The advantages of Six Sigma do not exactly lie in huge cost benefits that can be realized by its implementation. The glaring examples of many corporations having saved billions of dollars are true benefits but the intangible results, such as having met the expectations of customers, and being able to improve employee relations are also paramount. Because some corporations have experienced its failure to meet stated goals, some critics often raise questions about the feasibility of implementing Six Sigma, while still others are dismissing it plainly.</p>
<p>Obviously, in almost all cases, the reasons for Six Sigma failure have been external factors such as wrong or misguided selection of the tools, lack of application and lack of support from upper management. It is important to keep in mind that the successful implementation of Six Sigma requires a top down approach and perseverance throughout. Also important to the process is proper and thorough Six Sigma training.</p>
<p><b>Financial Benefits:</b></p>
<p>Cash flow increases due to creation of additional revenue. Through this process although cost decreases and increased profitability can be seen. It is important that all professionals involved in Six Sigma implementation have proper Six Sigma training. Although Six Sigma training is relatively expensive, the financial benefits of supporting it greatly outweigh the upfront costs.</p>
<p><b>Customer Service Benefit:</b></p>
<p>In 1999, Citibank’s strategy for improving customer service using Six Sigma methodology led to key projects in streamlining customer banking services and optimizing business processes that led to customer dissatisfaction and then eventually to lost accounts. (Reference 4) By implementing a reporting process to benchmark superior performance and identify areas of opportunity from the customer perspective, Citibank began incorporating business practices and services that would enhance existing customer loyalty and work to gain market share with enhanced products and business expectations.</p>
<p><b>Operational Benefits Of Six Sigma Training:</b></p>
<p>Employee satisfaction due to improvement in work flow, reduction in process times and steps, better usage of work space, etc. result from implementation of Six Sigma. One major operational reason for choosing Six Sigma is its success in waste reduction and redundancy. Waste reduction is measured in terms of improving time, product movement and decreasing material consumption.</p>
<p><b>Efficiency Benefit:</b></p>
<p>Six Sigma can assist companies in refining process to ensure materials and resources are used only as they are needed. With this effort to identify and eliminate excess, companies are able to preserve valuable resources. The Dow Chemical Company shared their Six Sigma successes in a case study released at the Texas Technology Showcase in 2003. (Reference 5) In its Styrene Unit Energy Envelope Project, Dow was able to reduce energy output by 80 MMBtu per hour. The project was successful in identifying opportunities to improve overall plant efficiency and reduce emissions.</p>
<p><b>Criticism</b></p>
<p><b>Lack of originality:</b></p>
<p>Noted quality expert Joseph M. Juran has described Six Sigma as “a basic version of quality improvement”, stating that “there is nothing new there. It includes what we used to call facilitators. They’ve adopted more flamboyant terms, like belts with different colors. I think that concept has merit to set apart, to create specialists who can be very helpful. Again, that’s not a new idea. The American Society for Quality long ago established certificates, such as for reliability engineers.”</p>
<p><b>Role of consultants:</b></p>
<p>The use of “Black Belts” as itinerant change agents has (controversially) fostered an industry of training and certification. Critics argue there is overselling of Six Sigma by too great a number of consulting firms, many of which claim expertise in Six Sigma when they only have a rudimentary understanding of the tools and techniques involved.</p>
<p><b>Potential negative effects:</b></p>
<p>A Fortune article stated that “of 58 large companies that have announced Six Sigma programs, 91 percent have trailed the S&amp;P 500 since”. The statement is attributed to “an analysis by Charles Holland of consulting firm Qualpro (which espouses a competing quality-improvement process).” The summary of the article is that Six Sigma is effective at what it is intended to do, but that it is “narrowly designed to fix an existing process” and does not help in “coming up with new products or disruptive technologies.” Advocates of Six Sigma have argued that many of these claims are in error or ill-informed.</p>
<p>A BusinessWeek article says that James McNerney‘s introduction of Six Sigma at 3M may have had the effect of stifling creativity. It cites two Wharton School professors who say that Six Sigma leads to incremental innovation at the expense of blue-sky work. This phenomenon is further explored in the book, Going Lean, which describes a related approach known as lean dynamics and provides data to show that Ford‘s “6 Sigma” program did little to change its fortunes.</p>
<p><b>Based on arbitrary standards</b></p>
<p>While 3.4 defects per million opportunities might work well for certain products/processes, it might not operate optimally or cost effectively for others. A pacemaker process might need higher standards, for example, whereas a direct mail advertising campaign might need lower standards. The basis and justification for choosing 6 (as opposed to 5 or 7, for example) as the number of standard deviations is not clearly explained. In addition, the Six Sigma model assumes that the process data always conform to the normal distribution. The calculation of defect rates for situations where the normal distribution model does not apply is not properly addressed in the current Six Sigma literature.</p>
<p><b>Criticism of the 1.5 sigma shift</b></p>
<p>The statistician Donald J. Wheeler has dismissed the 1.5 sigma shift as “goofy” because of its arbitrary nature. Its universal applicability is seen as doubtful.</p>
<p>The 1.5 sigma shift has also become contentious because it results in stated “sigma levels” that reflect short-term rather than long-term performance: a process that has long-term defect levels corresponding to 4.5 sigma performance is, by Six Sigma convention, described as a “6 sigma process.” The accepted Six Sigma scoring system thus cannot be equated to actual normal distribution probabilities for the stated number of standard deviations, and this has been a key bone of contention about how Six Sigma measures are defined. The fact that it is rarely explained that a “6 sigma” process will have long-term defect rates corresponding to 4.5 sigma performance rather than actual 6 sigma performance has led several commentators to express the opinion that Six Sigma is a confidence trick.</p>

banks or micro finance provider to the million the middle – businesses and<br/>
individual- who are severely constrained in their ability to produce and save<br/>
for lack of access to financial resources and services. Until modern,<br/>
competitive financial services are readily available – including credit in<br/>
amounts, terms and conditions that small can access, Bangladesh will not be<br/>
able to create the large middle class that is a prerequisite to social<br/>
stability. </p>

<p><b></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;line-height:150%"">Michael Porter has identified five<br/>
forces that are widely used to assess the structure of any industry. Porter’s<br/>
five forces are:</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;line-height:150%"">Together, the strength of the five<br/>
forces determines the profit potential in an industry by influencing the<br/>
prices, costs, and required investments of businesses—the elements of return on<br/>
investment. Stronger forces are associated with a more challenging business.<u><br/>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt""><img alt=""porter"" height=""466"" loading=""lazy"" src=""file:///C:/Users/Papon/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/02/clip_image021.gif"" v:shapes=""Picture_x0020_9"" width=""576""/></span></p>
<p style=""
text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Intensity of Rivalry<br/>
amongst competitors</span></b></p>
<p style=""
text-align:justify;line-height:
150%"">Rivalry among competitors is often the strongest of the five competitive<br/>
forces, but can vary widely among industries. If the competitive force is weak,<br/>
companies may be able to raise prices, provide less service for the price, and<br/>
earn more profits. If competition is intense, it may be necessary to enhance<br/>
product offerings to keep customers, and prices may fall below break-even<br/>
levels. </p>
<p style=""
text-align:justify;line-height:
150%"">In Bangladesh there are more than 30 commercial banks that compete in the<br/>
same industry. The national banks have the highest banking network in<br/>
Bangladesh. They compete with other banks with their low cost of operation and<br/>
government support. Again, Standard Chartered bank is the largest multinational<br/>
banking network in Bangladesh that has its network in many metropolitans of<br/>
Bangladesh. There are other international banks such as HSBC that also take<br/>
part in the competition and are aggressive in nature. Due to the increasing<br/>
number of banks in Bangladesh it makes difficult for the existing banks such as<br/>
BRAC Bank Limited to compete in the long run.</p>
<p style=""
text-align:justify;line-height:
150%"">In the Banking Sector, competition is about offering customers the most<br/>
attractive combination of services introducing new products, offering more<br/>
customer services, or creating a stronger brand image than competitors.</p>
<p style=""
text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Threat of new entrants:</span></b></p>
<p style=""
text-align:justify;line-height:
150%"">Analyzing the threat of new entrants involves examining the barriers to<br/>
entry and the expected reactions of existing firms to a new competitor.<br/>
Barriers to entry are the costs and/or legal requirements needed to enter a<br/>
market. These barriers protect the companies already in business by being a<br/>
hurdle to those trying to enter the market. In addition to up-front barriers, a<br/>
new competitor may inspire established companies to react with tactics to deter<br/>
entry, such as lowering prices or forming partnerships. The chance of reaction<br/>
is high in markets where firms have a history of retaliation, excess cash, are<br/>
committed to the industry.</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;line-height:150%"">The threat of new entrants is<br/>
moderate in the context of Bangladesh. Over the years it is seen that<br/>
increasing number of local banks have emerged in the local market. Moreover it<br/>
is seen that new international banks have also started their operations in<br/>
Bangladesh and also slowly increasing their branches countrywide. </p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;line-height:150%"">
</p><p style=""text-align:justify;line-height:150%"">In the context of BBL the various new<br/>
&amp; upcoming Banks pose a significant threat, being new entrants in the<br/>
banking sector of Bangladesh. But BBL is aware of these potential competitors<br/>
and is trying to expand countrywide to make the sector unattractive &amp; to<br/>
create entry barrier.</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;line-height:150%"">
</p><p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Threat<br/>
of substitute products</span></b></p>
<p style=""
text-align:justify;line-height:
150%"">Products from one business can be replaced by products from another. If<br/>
one produces a commodity product that is undifferentiated; customers can easily<br/>
switch away from that product to a competitor’s product with few consequences.<br/>
In contrast, there may be a distinct penalty for switching if the product is<br/>
unique or essential for the customer’s business.</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;line-height:150%"">Substitute products are those that<br/>
can fulfill a similar need to the one a product fills. The threat that<br/>
substitute products pose to an industry’s profitability depends on the relative<br/>
price-to-performance ratios of the different types of products or services to<br/>
which customers can turn to satisfy the same basic need. The threat of<br/>
substitution is also affected by switching costs – that is, the costs in areas<br/>
such as retraining, retooling and redesigning that are incurred when a customer<br/>
switches to a different type of product or service<span style=""color:#FF6600""></span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;color:#FF6600"">
</p><p style=""text-align:justify;line-height:150%"">BBL continuously faces the threat of<br/>
various substitute products launched by its strong competitors in the market<br/>
place. For example, the launch of premiere banking by SCB poses a strong threat<br/>
on BBL’s premium customer group and BBL is at a condition where it should<br/>
launch an even better product. Various local and international banks these days<br/>
are coming up with low cost new products which may pose a strong threat to<br/>
BBL’s banking. Since the switching costs are not that high there is always a<br/>
chance of customer changing their preferred banking services from a particular<br/>
bank. </p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""
color:#FF6600""></span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Bargaining<br/>
power of suppliers</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><u><span style=""font-size:
11.0pt""></span></u></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;line-height:150%"">Any business requires inputs—labor,<br/>
parts, raw materials, and services. The cost of inputs can have a significant<br/>
effect on a company’s profitability. Whether the strength of suppliers<br/>
represents a weak or a strong force hinges on the amount of bargaining power<br/>
they can exert and, ultimately, on how they can influence the terms and<br/>
conditions of transactions in their favor. Suppliers would prefer to sell to at<br/>
the highest price possible or provide with no more services than necessary. If<br/>
the force is weak, then one may be able to negotiate a favorable business deal<br/>
for themselves. Conversely, if the force is strong, then one will be in a weak<br/>
position and may have to pay a higher price or accept a lower level of quality<br/>
or service.</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;text-autospace:none""><span style=""line-height:150%""></span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;text-autospace:none"">The depositors of BRAC Bank Limited are the main suppliers of the<br/>
bank. Considering the economic condition of the country it can be said that the<br/>
bargaining power of the suppliers are very high. The main reason behind this is<br/>
that after the caretaker government took over the country huge amount of wealth<br/>
of politicians have been confiscated which otherwise would have been deposited<br/>
in different banks. As a result the banks in Bangladesh are in shortage of<br/>
depositors. Due to the shortages of depositors, the depositors are being able<br/>
to bargain a better negotiation. Moreover the BRAC Bank Limited is not being<br/>
able to decrease their interest rate on deposits which makes the bargaining<br/>
power of the suppliers very high.</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;
text-autospace:none""><b><u><span style=""font-size:11.0pt""></span></u></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;
text-autospace:none""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Bargaining power of<br/>
buyers</span></b></p>
<p style=""
text-align:justify;line-height:
150%"">The power of buyers describes the effect that customers have on the<br/>
profitability of a business. The transaction between the seller and the buyer<br/>
creates value for both parties. But if buyers (who may be distributors,<br/>
consumers, or other manufacturers) have more economic power, then the firm’s<br/>
ability to capture a high proportion of the value created will decrease, and<br/>
the firm will earn lower profit.</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;text-autospace:none"">Considering the global financial downturn and also the current<br/>
economic situation of the country it is seen that customers are reluctant to go<br/>
for new investments and also due to the global financial turmoil it is seen<br/>
that imports have been reduced to a greater extent. As a result fewer importers<br/>
are opening LC’s through BRAC and other banks. Moreover fewer investors are<br/>
taking loans from the banks.</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;text-autospace:none"">
</p><p style=""text-align:justify;line-height:150%"">As the switching costs is not that<br/>
high, customers often tend to go for those banks where they provide low cost<br/>
and quality services These factors implies that the customers of BRAC Bank have<br/>
a high bargaining power.<span style=""color:#FF6600""></span></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Analysis</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.1 Preface</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our communication system &amp; technology is developing day by day. It is getting more interactive, more user-friendly, more manageable at the same time more secure. So, we have to adapt the new technology/system to adjust us with the global world.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.2 System Analysis</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Rapid improvement in hardware and software along with the effort of organizations to have a global reach, necessitates business systems that can respond fast and provide high performance. And this necessity and rapid changes in technologies make the task of developing software products more and more difficult. The main cause of failure of any software development projects is the lack of proper communication between the user and the developer. So before starting the development, the analysis of the current state is really necessary. In absence of proper analysis, a project will fail to satisfy its requirements.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A requirements analysis can be categorized as follows:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">2.2.1 Analysis of Traditional and Modern System</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">2.2.2 Analysis of User Requirements</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">2.2.3 Analysis of System Requirements</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">2.2.4 Analysis System Performance</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">2.2.5 Analysis of the Proposed System</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">2.2.6 Analyzing Security Requirements</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.2.1 Analysis of Traditional and Modern Systems</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To analyze the evolution of Web from its traditional to modern form we have to look at the historical development of web pages.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Conceptually, there are two aspects to a web page: Its content and the presentation of that content. Over the last decade, there has been an evolution of how these two pieces interact:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Static web pages— The content and presentation are in the same file.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Cascading Style Sheet web pages— Content and presentation are separated.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Dynamic web pages—<a name=""page_itself""></a> Content and presentation are separated from the web page itself.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a name=""ch01lev2sec1""></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Static Web Pages<a name=""web_page""></a></i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For the last 10 years, static sites have dominated the Internet landscape, and site maintenance has been a laborious and often frustrating process. Web masters had to cope with thousands of line of HTML code across a mass of Web page files. However, employing a dynamic site required a large amount of custom coding and potential unforeseen security loopholes.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Then Comes —eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML)—that tells your browser how to present the content of a web page. For example, the code might say, “Take this title ‘This is a web page,’ make it large, and make it bold.” The results will look something like in the figure 2.2.1.a:<a name=""ch01fig01""></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Figure 2.1.1.a Results of code on a web page</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a name=""iddle1117""></a><a name=""iddle1144""></a><a name=""iddle1273""></a><a name=""iddle1739""></a><a name=""iddle2081""></a><a name=""how_many""></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This way of creating a web page is outdated, but it’s astonishing how many designers still create sites using this outdated method. It has two main drawbacks:<a name=""All_of""></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· All of the content shown on the page (“This is a web page”) and the presentation (big and bold) are tied together. If you want to change the color of all your titles, you have to go through all the pages in your site to do so.<a name=""have_large""></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· The pages have large file sizes. Because each bit of content is individually styled, the pages are big, which means it takes forever to load. Most experts agree that this also penalizes your search engine optimization efforts as large pages are harder for search engines to index.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a name=""ch01lev2sec2""></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Cascading Style Sheet Web Pages</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a name=""next_step""></a>The next step toward understanding content management is a recent (recent meaning in the last four or five years) development of web</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">standards, a common set of “rules” that a web browser like Internet Explorer or Firefox uses to output a web page onto your screen. One of these standards involves using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to control the visual presentation of your web page. CSS is a simple mechanism for adding style (for example, fonts, colors, spacing, and so on) to web documents. All of this presentation information is contained in separate files from the content.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Now the web page generated might look something like Figure 2.2.1.b:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a name=""ch01fig02""></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Figure 2.2.1.b Modern web page using CSS<a name=""iddle1145""></a><a name=""iddle1319""></a><a name=""iddle2082""></a><a name=""because_it""></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Now the file containing the content is much smaller because it does not contain presentation or style information. All the styling has been placed in a separate file that the browser reads and “layers” over the content to produce the final result</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a name=""presentation_of""></a>Using CSS to control the presentation of the content has big advantages:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a name=""need_to""></a>· Maintaining and revising the page is much easier. If we need to change all the title colors, we can just change one line in the CSS file.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a name=""the_data""></a>· Both files are much smaller, which allows the data to load much more quickly than without using CSS.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a name=""it_will""></a>· The CSS file has the additional advantage that it will be cached (saved) on a viewer’s local computer so that it won’t need to be downloaded from the Web each time the viewer visits a page.<a name=""ch01note01""></a><a name=""ch01lev2sec3""></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Dynamic Web Pages<a name=""web_pages""></a></i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dynamic web pages are what are created by a CMS.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A CMS does for content what CSS does for presentation.<a name=""a_CMS""></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">That means, CSS separated presentation from content, a CMS separates the content from the page. This might seem like that leaves nothing, but in reality what is left can be thought of as “placeholders.” This can be represented as what’s shown in Figure 2.2.1.c :<a name=""ch01fig03""></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Figure 2.2.1.c Structure of a CMS web page</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a name=""some_content""></a>The “put some content here” instruction tells the CMS to take some content from a database, the “pure content,” and place it in a designated place on the page.<a name=""that_trick""></a> A question may be arise here, “So what’s so useful about that trick?” It’s actually very powerful.<a name=""The_web""></a> It separates out the responsibilities of developing a website. The web designer can concern himself with the presentation/design and the “placeholders.” This means that non-technical people can be responsible for the content—the words and pictures of a website. Most CMSs have built-in tools to manage the publication of the content.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a name=""this_in""></a>With this in mind, it’s possible to imagine a workflow for content management that involves both designers and content authors.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">See Figure 2.2.1.d in the next page.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a name=""ch01fig04""></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Figure 2.2.1.d The CMS manages content publication</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a name=""iddle1163""></a><a name=""iddle1352""></a><a name=""iddle1504""></a><a name=""iddle1619""></a><a name=""iddle1679""></a><a name=""iddle1760""></a><a name=""iddle1987""></a><a name=""follow_a""></a>A CMS makes the pages dynamic- They don’t really exist until you follow a link to view them. This means that they can be updated/customized based on the viewer’s interactions with the page. For example, if we place an item in a shopping cart, that item now shows up on the shopping cart page. It got stored in a database and now gets put into the “shopping cart placeholder.” Many complex web applications are in fact mini CMSs (by this definition), like forums, shopping carts, and guest books, to name a few.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a name=""Another_good""></a>Another good example of CMSs are blogs. They have a “template” that presents all the content (or posts, in this case), and blogs are easy to edit and publish. The growth in the use of CMSs for powering websites is probably due in part to the huge rise in popularity of blogging tools such as Blogger and WordPress.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A CMS totally separates the content of the pages from their graphical design. This makes it easy to keep the site-wide design coherent and easy to change. It also makes adding content easy for non-technical people.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There is one large drawback to using a CMS. They can be extremely complex, containing thousands of files and scripts that work together in concert with databases to present a website. Normally, this means that a CMS site will be designed and created by technical staff and managed and run by non-technical users.<a name=""ch01note03""></a><a name=""You_Need""></a><a name=""that_cost""></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.2.2 Analysis of User Requirements</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A user is the person who participates in the business (profit/non-profit) activities and interacts with the application. To develop a product it is required to understand the user requirements. In our proposed system users are able to use easily.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.2.3 Analysis of System Requirements</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">While planning a new system, it is required to ensure that the system meets the requirements of business (profit/non-profit) and the users. It also needs to ensure that the new system will be compatible with the existing system. There are various issues involved in analyzing system requirements. These are:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Hardware Requirement</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">While implementing the new system, it is required to ensure that it can be implemented without affecting the existing hardware and system performance adversely.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Software Requirement</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The software requirements including the operating system and protocols also need to be considered while implementing a new system.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Functional Requirement</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Apart from the hardware and software requirements, it is also necessary to ensure that the system conforms to all the requirements in terms of business (profit/non-profit) rules and security.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.2.4 Analysis of System Performance</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The application to be developed is required to provide high performance in terms of the number of transactions processed. This is to enable a large number of users to use the web site at the same time. If the response time of the application increases with the increase in the number of users, it may result in a user waiting for a long time and checking out other options. This may lead to loss of clientele. The followings are the performance requirements of the system to be developed,</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• The response time should be minimizing.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• The bandwidth of the system should support the number of transaction per time slice.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• The system should be stable and should not fall under increased workload.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.2.5 Analysis of the Proposed System</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The proposed Health Care Information System is to be developed as a web site using content management system. That will help people to get all types of health care information. At the same time, people can consult with our 24 hours online doctor for free of charge. This health service will provide people-news, tips &amp; advice on health care at any time and from any place in an efficient and comparatively faster way. Our Health Care Information System contains the contacts, addresses of specialized doctors, hospitals/clinics, pathology/diagnostic centres, blood &amp; eye banks, fitness centres &amp; all sorts of health tips like first aid, fitness, diet/nutrition, diseases/cures &amp; online advice from doctor. There are options to get registered (free) with us as member, to get the benefit of online doctor &amp; daily health tips feedback through email. Member/guest has the opportunity to search specific topic on health in our site that she/he is looking for. Daily updated health tips are included for making conscious the member/guest about daily health care.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.2.6 Analyzing Security Requirements</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The security of the system and data is of primary concern. The two types of security policies that were considered are optimistic security policy and pessimistic security policy. The former one gives protection to only those resources, which have sensitive data and the latter one aims at protection of all resources allowing restricted access to users.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As we are going to build up web site within a framework which uses pessimistic security policy, we need not to worry about the security.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.3 Feasibility Study</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A feasibility study is an assessment of a proposed information system to determine whether the system effectively meets the specified requirements of the organization and whether a business case exist for developing such a system. It means the possibility , the scope of the project , with the help of feasibility study we can:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Clarify the objective of a proposed system development project.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Provide a better understanding of a business problem.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Assess and recommend what course of action should be taken for its solution.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We can divide feasibility study into following parts :</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Technical feasibility</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Operational feasibility</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Financial feasibility</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Technical feasibility</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The present manual system contains no automated features. Therefore developing a computer system these things are very much necessary</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· A network of computers or an online connection is must for this system.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Reports for generating the results and other necessary information.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· High speed processors are not necessary for maintaining databases.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Operational feasibility</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">People who are accessing this site need not proper training . Common knowledge about computers is only necessary. With the minimum knowledge to operate computers and internet browsing is enough. Who does have any knowledge about computers, it is not hard to learn from others or can get help easily from anyone who knowledge about computers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Financial feasibility</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This is an important part of the feasibility study , cost benefit analysis has to be done to start the project. Without financial assurance a system may be taken off its analysis face. Therefore from the analysis, it can be clearly seen that the suggested system is financially feasible.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">2.4 Summary</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It is necessary to analyze the system before starting the development. And also a clear understanding of the system should mean a developers. Otherwise, it would be really difficult to develop an error free system.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Design</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>3.1 Preface</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">From analysis, we understand that the appropriate web development technique is using Content Management System (CMS). The range of available CMSs are extensive—from enterprise scale versions that cost $300,000 to open source versions, such as CodeIgniter! that are free. Modern CMSs are usually defined by their capability to manage and publish content. They typically have workflow processes that start at content creation and move to publishing. Most do far more: They have the capability to add on a wide range of extensions or add-ons to give the site more functionality. From forums to newsletters, CodeIgniter! has over 2000 pluggable extensions available, many of which are free and are created by volunteer developers around the world. The official repository is at <a href=""http://extensions.joomla.org/"" target=""_blank"">extensions.joomla.org</a><a name=""commercial_extensions""></a> and a repository specializing in commercial extensions can be found at <a href=""http://www.extensionprofessionals.com/"" target=""_blank"">www.extensionprofessionals.com</a><a name=""an_extension""></a>. Both have a rating and review system (which is itself an extension!).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">CodeIgniter! is one of the key applications initiating the rebirth of the World Wide Web into what pundits are calling Web 2.0. Unlike Web 1.0, where most Web sites were manually administered and interaction was minimal, web 2.0 is defined by automated administration, intrasite and intersite communication, virtual communities and dynamic interaction. Joomla! embraces all of these new advances and provides a CMS that allows an advanced Web site to be created and managed by a small group of people (perhaps as small as one person). A CodeIgniter! Web site can rival the capabilities and presentation of a multi-million-dollar Web site.<a name=""ch01note04""></a><a name=""iddle1146""></a><a name=""iddle1148""></a><a name=""iddle1566""></a><a name=""iddle1729""></a><a name=""iddle1962""></a><a name=""iddle2085""></a><a name=""iddle2087""></a><a name=""is_one""></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">CodeIgniter! is probably the easiest to setup among currently available CMSs, allowing users of modest technical skill to harness its power. <a name=""community_of""></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Best of All- CodeIgniter! Is open source software that is 100% free. It is created by a world-wide community of developers and distributed at no charge under open source license of GNU/GPL. So, CodeIgniter! Is chosen to build our Health Care Information System.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>What is CodeIgniter?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">CodeIgniter is an Application Development Framework – a toolkit – for people who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed for a given task.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">CodeIgniter uses the Model-View-Controller approach, which allows great separation between logic and presentation. This is particularly good for projects in which designers are working with your template files, as the code these file contain will be minimized. We describe MVC in more detail on its own page.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>CodeIgniter Features:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Features in and of themselves are a very poor way to judge an application since they tell you nothing about the user experience, or how intuitively or intelligently it is designed. Features don’t reveal anything about the quality of the code, or the performance, or the attention to detail, or security practices. The only way to really judge an app is to try it and get to know the code. CodeIgniter is child’s play so we encourage you to do just that. In the mean time here’s a list of CodeIgniter’s main features.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Design and Architectural Goals:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our goal for CodeIgniter is <i>maximum performance, capability, and flexibility in the smallest, lightest possible package</i>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To meet this goal we are committed to benchmarking, re-factoring, and simplifying at every step of the development process, rejecting anything that doesn’t further the stated objective.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">From a technical and architectural standpoint, CodeIgniter was created with the following objectives:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dynamic Instantiation. In CodeIgniter, components are loaded and routines executed only when requested, rather than globally. No assumptions are made by the system regarding what may be needed beyond the minimal core resources, so the system is very light-weight by default. The events, as triggered by the HTTP request, and the controllers and views you design will determine what is invoked.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Loose Coupling. Coupling is the degree to which components of a system rely on each other. The less components depend on each other the more reusable and flexible the system becomes. Our goal was a very loosely coupled system.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Component Singularity. Singularity is the degree to which components have a narrowly focused purpose. In CodeIgniter, each class and its functions are highly autonomous in order to allow maximum usefulness.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">CodeIgniter is a dynamically instantiated, loosely coupled system with high component singularity. It strives for simplicity, flexibility, and high performance in a small footprint package.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Application Flow Chart of CodeIgniter :</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The following graphic illustrates how data flows throughout the system:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The index.php serves as the front controller, initializing the base resources needed to run CodeIgniter.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Router examines the HTTP request to determine what should be done with it.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If a cache file exists, it is sent directly to the browser, bypassing the normal system execution.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Security. Before the application controller is loaded, the HTTP request and any user submitted data is filtered for security.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Controller loads the model, core libraries, plugins, helpers, and any other resources needed to process the specific request.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The finalized View is rendered then sent to the web browser to be seen. If caching is enabled, the view is cached first so that on subsequent requests it can be served.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>What is a Controller of CodeIgniter?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><dfn>A Controller is simply a class file that is named in a way that can be associated with a URI.</dfn></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Consider this URI:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><code>example.com/index.php/</code><var>blog</var><code>/</code></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In the above example, CodeIgniter would attempt to find a controller named <dfn>blog.php</dfn> and load it.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Let’s create a simple controller so you can see it in action. Using your text editor, create a file called <dfn>blog.php</dfn>, and put the following code in it:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&lt;?php</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">class Blog extends Controller {</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">function index()</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">{</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">echo ‘Hello World!’;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">}</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">}</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">?&gt;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Then save the file to my <dfn>application/controllers/</dfn> folder.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Now visit the site using a URL similar to this:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><code>example.com/index.php/</code><var>blog</var><code>/</code></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Views of CodeIgniter:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A <dfn>view</dfn> is simply a web page, or a page fragment, like a header, footer, sidebar, etc. In fact, views can flexibly be embedded within other views (within other views, etc., etc.) if you need this type of hierarchy.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Views are never called directly, they must be loaded by a <a href=""http://127.0.0.1/ci/user_guide/general/controllers.html"">controller</a>. Remember that in an MVC framework, the Controller acts as the traffic cop, so it is responsible for fetching a particular view.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Creating a View:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Using your text editor, create a file called <dfn><b>blogview.php</b></dfn>, and put this in it:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&lt;html&gt;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&lt;head&gt;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&lt;title&gt;My Blog&lt;/title&gt;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&lt;/head&gt;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&lt;body&gt;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my Blog!&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&lt;/body&gt;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&lt;/html&gt;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Loading a View:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To load a particular view file you will use the following function:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><code>$this-&gt;load-&gt;view('</code><var>name</var><code>');</code></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Models of CodeIgniter:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Models are PHP classes that are designed to work with information in your database. For example, let’s say you use CodeIgniter to manage a blog. You might have a model class that contains functions to insert, update, and retrieve your blog data. Here is an example of what such a model class might look like:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><code>class Blogmodel extends Model {</code></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><code> var $title = '';</code></p>
<p><code> var $content = '';</code></p>
<p><code> var $date = '';</code></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><code> function Blogmodel()</code></p>
<p><code> {</code></p>
<p><code> // Call the Model constructor</code></p>
<p><code> parent::Model();</code></p>
<p><code> }</code></p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p><code> function get_last_ten_entries()</code></p>
<p><code> {</code></p>
<p><code> $query = $this-&gt;db-&gt;get('entries', 10);</code></p>
<p><code> return $query-&gt;result();</code></p>
<p><code> }</code></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><code> function insert_entry()</code></p>
<p><code> {</code></p>
<p><code> $this-&gt;title = $_POST['title']; // please read the below note</code></p>
<p><code> $this-&gt;content = $_POST['content'];</code></p>
<p><code> $this-&gt;date = time();</code></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><code> $this-&gt;db-&gt;insert('entries', $this);</code></p>
<p><code> }</code></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><code> function update_entry()</code></p>
<p><code> {</code></p>
<p><code> $this-&gt;title = $_POST['title'];</code></p>
<p><code> $this-&gt;content = $_POST['content'];</code></p>
<p><code> $this-&gt;date = time();</code></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><code> $this-&gt;db-&gt;update('entries', $this, array('id' =&gt; $_POST['id']));</code></p>
<p><code> }</code></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><code>}</code></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Using CodeIgniter Libraries:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">All of the available libraries are located in your <dfn>system/libraries</dfn> folder. In most cases, to use one of these classes involves initializing it within a <a href=""http://127.0.0.1/ci/user_guide/general/controllers.html"">controller</a> using the following initialization function:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><code>$this-&gt;load-&gt;library('</code><var>class name</var><code>');</code></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><acronym><b>3.3.2 MySql</b></acronym></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">MySQL is a database. A database defines a structure for storing information. In a database, there are tables. Just like HTML tables, database tables contain rows, columns, and cells. Databases are useful when storing information categorically. A company may have a database with the following tables: “Employees”, “Products”, “Customers” and “Orders”. MySQL is a database server. MySQL is ideal for both small and large applications MySQL supports standard SQL MySQL compiles on a number of platforms MySQL is free to download and use.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><acronym><b>Joomla! currently is using the database MySql. It will support other databases in near future.</b></acronym></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><acronym><b>3.3.3 Apache</b></acronym></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Every website on the internet is hosted on some server. Server is simply a computer which manages the access to a centralized resource or service in a network. The main job of the web server is to serve up web pages to client. Apache is a highly configurable Web Server with a modular design.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It is very easy to extend the capabilities of Apache Web server. Anyone with decent C or Perl programming expertise can write a module to perform a special function. This means that there are tons of Apache modules available for use. Apache is a free, open source technology.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Apache works great with Perl, PHP, and other scripting languages.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Apache runs on Linux and other Unix systems. Apache also runs on Windows. Apache offers many other features including fancy directory indexing; directory aliasing; content negotiations; configurable HTTP error reporting; SetUID execution of CGI Programs; resource management for child processes; server-side image maps; URL rewriting; URL spell checking; and online manuals.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It is the prerequisite that Web Server (Apache/IIS), PHP, MySql must be integrate properly to make CodeIgniter! functions properly. In this case, it is best to use CodeIgniter! with Apache. Because, if we learn to configure/integrate Apache, PHP, MySql properly it will help us in case of switching to and from Operating Systems (Like, Windows to Linux or, Vice Versa).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The following figure 3.3.3 makes it clear to understand.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><acronym><b>3.3.4 XAMPP</b></acronym></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There are plenty of standalone web servers which allows us to develop &amp; test websites locally. We don’t need to connect to internet. We can see any changes ourselves before making it live. That is, before we venture into the wilderness of the Internet, we should first develop and test our website on our local computer. This is an advantage as there are no connection fees, it is very fast, and we can practice at a leisurely pace. We can even have a small local network at home where we can install CodeIgniter! on one computer and access it from another.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">XAMPP is a free, cross-platform web server, consisting mainly of the Apache, MySql, PHP and Perl programming languages. Here, X in XAMPP denotes that it can be run on different operating system like windows, linux, Mac OS X etc. In order to avoid adding entries to registry XAMPP doesn’t need to run on user computer. It offers batch files to start and stop the server and database engine. This means we can even take XAMPP on our USB drive and run the server. There is no need for admin rights &amp; also have advantage of portability.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><acronym><b>3.4 DNS</b></acronym></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical naming system for computers, services, or any resource participating in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"" title=""Internet"">Internet</a>. It associates various information with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name"" title=""Domain name"">domain names</a> assigned to such participants. Most importantly, it translates domain names meaningful to humans into the numerical (binary) identifiers associated with networking equipment for the purpose of locating and addressing these devices world-wide. An often used analogy to explain the Domain Name System is that it serves as the “<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_directory"" title=""Telephone directory"">phone book</a>” for the Internet by translating human-friendly computer <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname"" title=""Hostname"">hostnames</a> into <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address"" title=""IP address"">IP addresses</a>. For example, <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Example.com"" title=""Example.com"">www.example.com</a></i> translates to <i>208.77.188.166</i>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Figure 3.4 How DNS Works</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Domain Name System makes it possible to assign <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name"" title=""Domain name"">domain names</a> to groups of Internet users in a meaningful way, independent of each user’s physical location. Because of this, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World-Wide_Web"" title=""World-Wide Web"">World-Wide Web</a> (WWW) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlinks"" title=""Hyperlinks"">hyperlinks</a> and Internet contact information can remain consistent and constant even if the current Internet routing arrangements change or the participant uses a mobile device. Internet domain names are easier to remember than IP addresses such as <tt>208.77.188.166</tt> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4"" title=""IPv4"">IPv4</a>) or <tt>2001:db8:1f70::999:de8:7648:6e8</tt> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6"" title=""IPv6"">IPv6</a>). People take advantage of this when they recite meaningful <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator"" title=""Uniform Resource Locator"">URLs</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail_address"" title=""E-mail address"">e-mail addresses</a> without having to know how the machine will actually locate them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Domain Name System distributes the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to IP addresses by designating <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritative_name_server"" title=""Authoritative name server"">authoritative name servers</a> for each domain. Authoritative name servers are assigned to be responsible for their particular domains, and in turn can assign other authoritative name servers for their sub-domains. This mechanism has made the DNS distributed, fault tolerant, and helped avoid the need for a single central register to be continually consulted and updated.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><acronym><b>3.5 HTTP</b></acronym></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. The web protocol called Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the language or format for communications from browser to Web server and back, and is therefore fundamental to many aspects of PHP. The message passed from the browser to the Web server is known as an HTTP request. The message sent from the Web server to the browser is called the HTTP response. HTTP message format, which breaks down into three sections: the request/response line, the HTTP header, and the HTTP body. Internet protocols define the format for all Internet communications between computers. For file transfers, FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used, and for Web communications, HTTP is used.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The HTTP is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and distributed object management systems, through extension of its request methods, error codes and headers. A feature of HTTP is the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built independently of the data being transferred.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Implementation</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>4.1 Preface</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In this chapter, the implementation of my project is described. The necessary softwares and tools that are required for developing the project are XAMPP, CodeIgniter! Extensions and all are installed and integrated in Windows Platform.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">4.2 Installation and Integration of Required Softwares</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">First we have to download XAMPP-win32-1.6.7-installer.exe from the site (<b>http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html), then we have to follow the following installation procedures:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">4.2.1 XAMPP Installation Procedures</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• We have to Click the XAMPP installer.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• A window will popup looking like the following Figure 4.2.1.a</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Figure 4.2.1.a XAMPP Installation Screenshot</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• We will click next to continue installation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Figure 4.2.1.b XAMPP Installation Screenshot</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• A screen looking like the Figure 4.2.1.b will come, where we will select the installation path of the XAMPP and click Next to continue installation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Figure 4.2.1.c XAMPP Installation Screenshot</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• A screen looking like the Figure 4.2.1.c will come, where we will select the Apache and MySql to be run as services. Now, Click Next to continue installation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Figure 4.2.1.d XAMPP Installation Screenshot</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Now, the installation process starts like Figure 4.2.1.d and we will wait for the next screen to come.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Figure 4.2.1.e XAMPP Installation Screenshot</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• In this screen we will see that the XAMPP installation is succeed (Figure 4.2.1.d) We will click Finish to complete the installation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• When you double-click on the <b>xampp-control.exe </b>file in the xampp directory, Apache and MySQL start up. PHP is launched automatically as an Apache module. XAMPP makes no entries in the Windows Registry and sets no system variables. We can see the XAMPP Control panel as shown in the Figure 4.2.1.f</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Figure 4.2.1.f XAMPP Installation Screenshot</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Now, We will open our Internet browser and enter <b>http://127.0.0.1/ </b>or <b>http://localhost/</b>. If Installation is OK, then we will see the XAMMP start page. Click on the English link and browser will display a page like Figure 4.2.1.g.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Figure 4.2.1.g XAMPP Installation Screenshot</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In this step, we will download CodeIgniter-Stable-Full_Package.zip from the site (<b>http://www.CodeIgniter.org), then we have to follow the following installation procedures:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>4.2.2 CodeIgniter! Installation Procedures</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• We have to Unzip the CodeIgniter! zipped package.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Rename this Unzipped folder something like peopledata</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Copy it to the XAMPP root directory “../htdocs”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Now, we open a browser and type “localhost/peopledata in the address bar, it makes the CodeIgniter! installation procedure get started</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Here, We have to select the language of the installation procedure. We keep the default (en-US – English). Now, Click Next.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• In this step, pre-installation check has been performed. We have to make sure that all recommended options are fulfilled.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• In the next step, We have to agree with the GNU/GPL License Agreement</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• In the next step, We have to assign a database for our project. It is “hcbd” and host (here, localhost) of the database is also need to be selected</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• In the next step, we will be offered to enable and configure FTP facility. But as we are not using this, just click next to continue installation process</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Now, we will assign a site name to our web site and it is “CodeIgniter”. Here we will also enter our administrative password and email address of administrator</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• In this step, we are given notice to completely delete the installation folder from the “CodeIgniter” to make CodeIgniter! security stronger and through deleting the installation folder we completed the CodeIgniter! installation procedures successfully.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>4.2.3 CodeIgniter! Frontend and Backend</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Now, Let us open a new browser window/tab and type in the address bar “cocalhost/CodeIgniter”. This will open a web page which is the default frontend of the CodeIgniter site layout.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Fig: CodeIgniter layout</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Now, Let us open a new browser window for the user guide of CodeIgniter. This is the user guide for my CodeIgniter CodeIgniter project!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Fig: CodeIgniter User guide layout</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>4.2.4 CodeIgniter! Extension Installation Procedures</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Now, We will install necessary CodeIgniter! Extensions to enrich CodeIgniter!’s functionality. That’s why, We first have to downloaded certain Extensions (JPFChat Module and MSComment Component) from the CodeIgniter! Extension site- “http://www.extensions.CodeIgniter.org”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Now we enter into the backend panel through Administrator Login Page. Then We go to the “Extension” Tab à “Install/Uninstall” Option</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Here in the installation section We have to “Browse” the module and component and click to the “Upload File &amp; Install” Button to install those module and component one after another (Figure 4.2.4.b), We can see the “installation success” message if all goes correct.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Now, We can see the new installed module and component into the module-tab and component-tab respectively. We can enable and configure those extensions as necessary.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• In this step, we will setup a Developed/Modified template for our project. So, first we should download or have any existing template and change its Cascading Style Sheet, Images and Template Elements as necessary and as our choice; Then copy the Modified Template folder and paste it into the directory – “../htdocs/Peopledata/templates/”.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• For the frontend we write the html script in the view folder. Then we again write the php code to control the view. We called the function of the view folder. Then we can show the front page by using the url path localhast/peopledata(name of the file which is saved in the controller folder).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Figure 4.2.4.d Project Template on frontend</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>4.3 Project Development</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In project development, we will develop the expected web project. For this, we have to develop web services like: web article, web menu, user login option, searching option, comment option etc.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The development of these web services are described as follows:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>4.3.1 Web Article Development</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To create Article in CodeIgniter! we go to the view folder and write code which is must be show to the websitew and for the backend we write the code in the model folder for the database.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Figure 4.3.1 Web Article Creation</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• We can use any library function in the CodeIgniter.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• We created articles like,the information of local people.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>4.3.2 Web Menu Development</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To create menu in CodeIgniter! we go to the view folder and write the code by html to view the menu button that can be viewed by the controller of the CodeIgniter (figure 4.3.2.a).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Figure 4.3.2.a Web Menu Creation</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Figure 4.3.2.b Web Menu Creation</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Now We have to add Menu Items in the “Main Menu” by writing the code again in the view folder that is controlled by the controller of the CodeIgniter.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Figure 4.3.2.b Web Menu Item Creation</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Now, We will link Menu Items by calling the appropriate function name and of view and model that coded before.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To link menu item to article we take the following steps.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• We have to first open the appropriate code and select it in to the models and view. Then called it in the controller.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>4.3.3 User Login Option Development</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To Develop User Login Option in CodeIgniter! is like a piece of cake. First, We go to view and write a code to create button and write the code again in the model to match the user name and password.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Figure 4.3.3.a User Logon Option Development</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Figure 4.3.3.b User Login Option Development</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• After inserting the username and password then a user can inter the login form.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>4.3.4 Searching Option Development</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To add a searching option in our project is also a simple task in CodeIgniter! This Searching code written in the controller page. In this code, called a function from the viewer and helper and load a library function. A model function and a viewer function will be called in the controller function.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Figure 4.3.4.a Searching Option Development</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Figure 4.3.4.b Searching Option Development</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>4.4 Summary</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Now we have completed our project development. Here are the developed project’s screenshots.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Main Page’s Screen shot of our Site is given below.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Testing and Debugging</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>5.1 Preface</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">System testing is the process of testing system in a controlled manner to ensure that it behaves the way it is expected to behave. System testing is, thus a critical element of assuring quality of the developed system. Testing requires that the developer discards preconceived notices of the correctness of the system just developed and overcome the conflict of interest that occurs when errors are revealed.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There are various types of testing and debugging method exists.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">But we have selected the following appropriate testing methods for our project.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>5.2 Functionality Testing and Debugging</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This test specifies operating conditions, input values and expected results.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In our project, we tests the functionality like when we have inputted any text in the search box, the search engine perfectly find out the result exactly based on the topic.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>5.3 Performance Testing and Debugging</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It involves system performance testing like when we browse the site how fast the site is loaded, this performance depends basically on the coding style and the network that the user is using.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">5.4 Security Testing and Debugging</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Security testing involves checking system’s security holes and debug them as necessary.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In our system, we have checked our user database that cannot be accessed without proper authority.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Moreover, Unauthorized access to web resources like trying to chat without being a member is not possible.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">5.5 Conclusion</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As no system/software is 100% secured or bug free. So, we cannot guarantee that there is no holes or bugs in our system but common erroneous situations are checked and found no one.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The development of this robust, bug free and secured project was possible due to using the framework of CodeIgniter!</p>

<div class=""entry-content"">
<p>The first thing that comes in mind when we mention “Arab women” is housekeeping and domestic chores. For some time this concept was true. But nowadays, Arab women have proved themselves in many aspects of the society. Still, there are some that believe that a woman’s place is at home, but for the most part the society have gotten used to seeing women at work. This is not to put down from the value of house wives, they do as much work and are as appreciated as any other woman who holds a high rank in society. In this section of the article we will dedicate it for Egyptian women.</p>
<p><strong>History of Women’s Liberation</strong></p>
<p>Women in Egypt have been battling for their legal right, access to education, and economical rights for centuries. Because Egypt was under the British rule at one point, its women have been exposed to the western ideas, especially those of the upper class. The fight was not only important to those westernized women that have discarded the veil publicly, but also by those who chose to keep the veil but wanted their legal rights. Among those women are Huda Sha’rawi and Zainab al-Ghazaly. These two women were the first women that adopted the war for women’s rights in Egypt. Although there have been associations made by women to discuss and find solutions for women’s legal rights in Egypt, Huda Sha’rawi is still considered the mother feminization in Egypt. She is the founder of the Egyptian Feminist Union in 1923. She campaigned for women’s voting rights, equal access to education and change in the Egyptian marriage laws, especially that her own experience with marriage was not a successful one. In 1923, Sha’rawi attended an international women’s conference in Rome. After her return she stopped wearing her face veil. Her argument was that the veil is a symbol of women’s lower status in Egyptian society. The veil was greatly criticized by western feminists in the conference. But she continued to wear a scarf covering her hair which agrees with Islamic traditions and customs.</p>
<p>Zainab al-Ghazali, a disciple of Sha’rawi, took a different approach. She was the founder of the Muslim Women’s Association in 1936. The association’s goal was to educate Muslim women to take pride and understand their traditions better.</p>
<p><strong>Status of Egyptian Woman Today</strong></p>
<p>Egyptian woman today is definitely different from the past. Nowadays women hold critical positions in the society. Where before women were more or less confined to their homes and bearing and raising children, today women are in political, medical, and high social ranks. Women in Egypt are even involved in the military. But women are found also in very odd position. There’s the female truck driver, bus driver, and even taxi drivers. Women are not only allowed to vote, they’re also allowed to run for political positions. They can demand their rights to divorce their husbands if they’re treated badly. They are also responsible for raising their children in the best manner and in accordance to the culture and traditions. So, it is obvious that the status of women have greatly evolved into one that is almost equal to man. Although in some areas, such as Upper Egypt, women are still being oppressed and cannot fully implement their full rights; this problem is on its way to being resolved.</p>
<p><strong>Working Women</strong></p>
<p>The Egyptian woman is now involved in many fields of the society. Women are great doctors and scientists, politics and great thinkers. It was the first lady Jihan el-Sadat who entered the political field and fought for women’s rights to run for political positions. She succeeded to dedicate 30 seats for women in the People’s counsel. Unfortunately, this legislation was canceled after the death of president el-Sadat. Nowadays, first Lady Suzan Mubarak is a symbol of a great woman involved in politics. Her efforts and the efforts of other women in the Egyptian National Counsel for Women that women are now being involved the upcoming plan national development. There are many known names in political society that are women.</p>
<p>Although women have gained status in the political field, but still some in some areas they’re being fought against. As an example, there’s a controversy these days about women holding positions as judges. 75% of males working in the judging field, courts in general, refuse to have a woman that has an authority over them at their work. In a survey that questioned 100 member of the field, 51% of the judges refused to have a woman judge among them and 49% accepted but only on the condition that the woman is to do advising work only, not as a judge. What are strange are the excuses these men used to their refusal. One of the judges said that it is not appropriate (forbidden by religion) that he sits alone with a lady judge in the discussion room, especially if the lady is attractive. Another was questioning what should be done in case the woman judge asked for a maternity leave of any other vacation that she legally deserves (as a woman). And from the 75% that refused a woman to be the boss of them is the secretariat of the court of Sohag. He said that he would rather work as a microbus driver than work under the rule of a woman.</p>
<p>These views still show that most men in the society do not believe a woman can do their job, and even better. This also shows that the society (male society) views women as housekeepers and that their place should be at home. Even after the fact that one woman (Advisor Tahany el-Gabaly) was appointed as a judge in the High Court in 2002. After that no other woman was appointed such a position in almost four years. Commenting on that is one Judge that said that the government was right when they appointed a female judge, and that she was placed in the right place away from being in direct contact with the common citizens, because we are a conservative society.</p>
<p><strong>Education for Women</strong></p>
<p>It is clear that the percentage of women that are being educated has increased. Yet the overall literacy rate in Egypt is about 50%, it is not surprising to find that most of these educated are men. Girls are allowed to study up until they reach an age where they can get married. But this phenomenon is mostly practiced in the villages of Upper Egypt and poor areas of large cities. Most fathers now are eager to let their girls learn up until they finish higher education. Girls that leave school at an early age are either to work to help with the family income or because their fathers still think with the old ideology that a woman’s place is at home.</p>
<p><strong>Women at Home</strong></p>
<p>It is very clear from the previous sections in this article that most Arab men prefer their wives to stay at home and look after the kids. Only a few are happy with their wives working. And usually these wives are torn apart between their jobs and their house work. It is very difficult and frustrating for women to be working, especially in a male dominated society like ours. Beside her day job, she is obligated to clean the house, study for the kids, prepare dinner before her husband returns from his work, and does the entire house work. It is very rare to find a man who helps his wife with the house work or even helping with the kids. It is also very rare to find a man who is willing to leave his job to stay at home with the kids instead of his wife, even if the wife’s job pays more than his. These rare husbands are very common in western societies, not in our eastern ones.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Women are no doubt a very important pillar in the community. Without women there would be no life. They’re the symbol of delicacy, love, and utmost compassion. God Almighty has put in them very delicate feelings to care for other. He also put in them the strength to take on any difficulties that may face their families. Woman is a word that includes mother, sister, lover and wife, partner for good and for worse, a shoulder to cry on and hand that would stretch out to help. She could be the weakest creature when she’s in love and the strongest one when someone threatens her or her family. So please remember that God created Eve to be a helper for Adam, and not his servant.</p>
<p><strong>Women in Kuwait</strong></p>
<p><strong>Women and politics</strong></p>
<p>Kuwait is a small and oil-rich state where women are said to be among the most emancipated in the Gulf region, which is incredibly conservative. Women in Kuwait can travel, drive, and work without their fathers’ or husbands’ consent and they even hold some senior government positions. But women in Kuwait have not yet gained the one right that most of them desire: the right to vote. Although the ruler of Kuwait, Sheikh Jaber al-Sabah, issued a royal decree in June of 1999 that stated women should be allowed to vote and run for office in the next election, a measure to put his will into law was defeated, 32 to 30, by legislators in November of 2000.</p>
<p>When compared to a place such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwaiti women have it good. In Saudi Arabia, no one has the right to vote and women still don’t have the right to drive a car (Muslim Women’s League). But this does not appease the Kuwaiti women.</p>
<p>For the very first time in Kuwait’s history, women of all ages and backgrounds turned out in force during the 29<sup>th</sup> June landmark parliamentary elections to exercise their newfound right of suffrage. Women finally got to fully participate in the decision making process and have their voices heard in the corridors of political power. Since parliament’s decision on 16<sup>th</sup> May 2005 to amend the electoral law, Kuwaiti women have quickly risen to become a major sought-after constituency. With their participation in the elections, Kuwait has witnessed a true democratic celebration. Thousands of women have embraced the elections with a first timer’s zeal.</p>
<p>Although no female candidate won a seat in the parliament, ballot counts have shown the participation of Kuwaiti women in the elections for the first time to reflect major progress.  Even though only 35% of eligible females voted, the level of their participation was higher than women’s participation in many other countries including western ones, the first time they exercise suffrage.</p>
<p>In Arab countries, men have traditionally been the providers, women the homemakers. This concept is slowly changing, however, as the attitudes of the outside world permeate Arab society.</p>
<p>This process is hastened by the influx of foreign women to Kuwait. For some time, Arab women have worked in teaching and nursing, but they’re increasingly also found in other fields, especially banking, finance and the service sector. The majority of expatriate female workers are employed in the service sector as doctors, lawyers, hotel administrators, in advertising, public relations, nursing, education and as stewardesses for the many national airlines.</p>
<p><strong>Women and work</strong></p>
<p>More local women are entering the work force in Kuwait and some employers view them as harder-working and more reliable than the average local male worker (and invariably cheaper to employ). Women rising to positions of power and influence tend to come from middle and upper echelon families. Indeed, for a woman to rise to a position of influence at work she needs the support of her family, especially the male members.</p>
<p>Most expatriate workers – whether western or eastern – are male. Their wives often have a restriction in their passport which prohibits them from working. Should the wives wish to work, they must obtain their own sponsorship and work visa, but employers tend to be biased against giving work visas to women. Women are often offered work (illegally) and, while this isn’t a major crime, it can result in the company being fined and the woman losing her job.</p>
<p>Women are generally safe in the workplace, with little sexual harassment because of the severe punishments for this. The influx of female ‘tourists’ (i.e. prostitutes) from eastern Europe in recent times, however, has reduced the level of respect that foreign females hitherto enjoyed. Women should also be careful not to be too friendly towards Arab men in the workplace, because this can be misunderstood as flirtatiousness.</p>
<p>In fact, the legal liabilities and social discrimination to which women in Kuwait are subject reach beyond political rights. According to <em>Freedom in the World 2003</em>, Freedom House’s annual worldwide survey of political rights and civil liberties, Kuwaiti women “are legally disadvantaged in matters of marriage, divorce, and inheritance, must have the permission of a male relative to obtain a passport; and cannot confer citizenship on their children.” In addition, and though the proportion is growing, women remain under-represented in the labor force.</p>
<p>But there are other reasons, rooted in Kuwaiti culture and history, to believe that suffrage is within view for Kuwaiti women and that the freedom they now enjoy will lead to further gains in the acquisition of civil rights. For starters, although excluded from political life, Kuwaiti women enjoy a relatively high degree of participation in professional life. They hold prominent positions in journalism, at the universities, in private business, in medicine, and in government ministries. They serve on the board of the Kuwait Petroleum Company. They constitute a little more than a third of the Kuwaiti labor force, and their numbers are likely to grow.</p>
<p>This is because women are flourishing in academic life in Kuwait. They constitute over 70 percent of the students at Kuwait University, and about half of those studying engineering and medicine. This is a result of two factors. The first, stressed by Kuwait social scientist Haya al-Mughni in <em>Women in Kuwait</em>, the leading book on the subject, is that in the late 1960s the government adopted the policy that women should be integrated into the work force. To this end, women were provided with educational opportunities. In particular, the government made education compulsory for all Kuwaiti children up to the age of 14, and women were admitted to the University of Kuwait.</p>
<p>These associations have been the chief vehicle through which Kuwaiti women activists, almost from the moment the country’s constitution was ratified in 1962, have sought their political rights. Prominent among these associations has been the Women’s Cultural and Social Society, founded in 1963. The WCSS believes that the struggle for women’s suffrage in Kuwait stands on firm constitutional ground: The Kuwaiti constitution’s preamble proclaims devotion to “democratic rule,” and article seven declares that “Justice, Liberty and Equality are the pillars of Society.” Through conferences, consciousness-raising, and lobbying members of the national assembly and the government, the Society has sought to overturn the election law passed in 1963, which provides the legal basis for excluding women from politics by providing rules and regulations covering only Kuwaiti men. Last year, a lawsuit, which the WCSS supported, challenging the constitutionality of the election law, was dismissed on procedural grounds.</p>
<p>According to Rasha Al-Sabah, a member of the ruling family, under minister of higher education, and the highest-ranking woman in the Kuwait government, Kuwait’s distinctive culture and history accounts for its openness to freedom. Located at the crossroads between the Arabian Desert and the Arabian Gulf, and blessed with a capacious natural port at the Gulf’s northern reaches, Kuwait originated as a trading center and served as a home to a seafaring and shipbuilding population.</p>
<p>Kuwait’s commercial character also shaped its political development. As an important trading port since the eighteenth century, Kuwait has been in constant contact with the outside world, particularly East Africa and India, and its diversity of beliefs and practices. And while the men were often at sea pearl-diving or trading for weeks or months at a time, women ran households and developed the ability to fend for themselves.</p>
<p>And where does the royal family stand on the question of women’s suffrage? Here too informed Kuwaitis differ. In 1999, under some pressure as a result of promises he had made to enlarge freedom in Kuwait after the 1990 Iraqi invasion, the emir finally issued an emergency decree, while parliament was dissolved, granting women the right to vote. However, such decrees eventually must be approved by a majority vote when the national assembly reconvenes; when it did, it rejected the measure by a vote of 32 to 30.</p>
<p>Some Kuwaiti liberals, such as Mohammed Al-Jassem, contend that this legislative defeat represented a kind of victory for the democratic process, for what the parliament was telling the emir, in Al-Jassem’s view, was that laws of such import should arise not by emergency decree but from the legislature. Others, such as Fatima Hussain, argue that the defeat of the measure merely reflected a lamentable lack of political will on the part of the government.</p>
<p>Only one political group in Kuwait strongly opposes giving women the right to vote and that is the influential minority whose ultimate aim is to make Muslim law not just one source of Kuwaiti law, as the constitution declares, but the <em>sole</em> source of Kuwaiti law. I mentioned the Islamist view — that Islam itself prohibits the participation of women in politics — to the students at GUST, and wondered how such a religion could ever be reconciled with democracy. Shaikha Al-Ali, seven months pregnant and among those who had expressed little concern about lacking the vote, replied with steel in her voice and fire in her eyes that there was no problem because there was no contradiction between women’s political participation and her interpretation of Islam.</p>
<p>Nobody can say just when women in Kuwait will acquire the right to vote, but where the press is robust and free, where women avidly form voluntary organizations to help others and to advance their own interests, and where the willingness to live between cultures and to submit religious questions to the authority of one’s personal judgment becomes second nature, respect for the just claims of equality can’t be far behind.</p>
<p><strong>Women in Saudi Arabia</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Saudi women become the principle problem of Saudi society. Women in Saudi society are different from women in any other Muslim societies where women have political and social rights. Islam set up rules to regulates the relationships between male and female. Some countries as, Saudi Arabia, is considered male societies and have no value for women. In Saudi Arabia, males are considered the backbone of the societies and women do not share in any decisions about their lives. In this society women are forbidden their simplest rights as, discrimination against women is performed and the laws or other measures counteract discrimination are absence. The most important problems are education, working and marriage.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Saudi-Arabia is considered one of the countries that emphasize religious aspects without its spirit. Women cannot have higher levels of education. If they want to work, they cannot work in high position. They have limited places for work. They cannot share in any important discussion and cannot hold any political positions. Women cannot depend on themselves. They only listen to their family’s orders without refusing. In Saudi Arabia, women cannot choose her husband who will share her life forever. Authorities put wrong instructions for women’s lives. They hide under Islam’s slogan, although Islam clarified women’s rights in the society as, society is consider a combination between men and women and cannot be formed without one of the both.</p>
<p><strong>Education</strong></p>
<p>In the past Islam defined the family as a social arrangement regulating the bond among men and women. At the beginning, Saudi Arabia used the right rules of Islam toward women as; women were able to receive education in 1962 and were progressing in various fields. They were at the beginning to take their life like other Countries. The coming of Muslim brothers to Saudi Arabia sixties and seventies, escaping the tyranny of Gamal Abdel Naser and in Eighties , escaping the massacre of Muslim Brothers in Syria and their accession to Saudi citizenship and work in education.(Al-nabulsi). They controlled the education system and prevented the communication among gender. The society depends on the male power and authorities. Muslim Brothers thought that women are created only to be homemakers and bring children. Women were forbidden from their simplest rights that Islam has given to them. There are many countries like Pakistan, Indonesia and Malaysia where women have social and political rights. These countries are like Saudi Arabia in their emphasizing on their Islam, but they applied the true rules of the society. From age to age traditional and customs moved from placed to another place and women prevented from their rights in the life.</p>
<p><strong>Women at work</strong></p>
<p>Before the spread of Islam, women were treated like animals. Islam raised the importance of women in the society and clarified all their rights to live a good life among male. During early Islam ages, women had the ability to be educated different types of educations and could work in the suitable places. The best example working women, the prophet wife who worked in the business. Saudi Arabia tried to follow the early Islamic ages, but authorities put wrong rules for women’s lives. Women cannot complete their education to high levels as found in other countries. They must go to other countries to complete their educations. In their countries, they do not find available jobs for their educations because the society is male dominated which does not care about women. Women face a lot of obstacles at work due to the different traditions and customs in the society. They cannot reach to high political position. According to Samar Fatany, chief broadcaster for Radio Jeddah’s English account for fifty-five percent of Saudi graduates but make up just under workforce.</p>
<p><strong>Marriage</strong></p>
<p>Other problems that face women are marriage. Most women do not have the ability to choose their husband they only listen to their family orders. In this society male does not know the real value of women. According to the family physician Maha Alatta, in the article “Saudi women pioneers ” “Divorce and polygamy are particular problems: These two problem are considered the most problems facing women in these societies Male has the ability to marriage four wives, Islam stipulated the polygamy as, a msn must treat all wives fairly and equally. According to the article “Saudi women struggle to confront the religious guise of male power” Mohammed Saqr clarified that women were better than they arrived of Muslim Brothers as, women could go shopping without covering their face. Muslim Brothers change the lives without using Islam rules as they said.</p>
<p><strong>Discussing the Situation</strong></p>
<p>There are a lot of conferences that were established to discuss women’s problem in Saudi Arabia. According to the article “Saudi Arabia: Gross human rights abuse against women.” Which clarified the opinion of Prince Turki Bin Mohammed, when he was asked in the conferences of Amnesty’s campaign against human rights about the problem of women; he kept silent and said that suffering of women for no reasons other than their having been born female. In the same article, other examples of conferences that established for convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). Saudi Arabia has ratified several international labor organization (ILO) conventions. One of the clear evidence about this problem what happened in Nejd, Asir and south region. As Amal al Ahmari said that female artists are forced to sign their work with pseudonym because Saudi society looks down on them. According to the least world view to Saudi women, ninety-five percent of women are consider homemakers and they preferred sons than daughters. There are a lot of example that prove that women have fought for political and civil equality, when Saudi women derived car during the gulf war, they were immediately arrested and those working were dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The more pressures put on government in Saudi Arabia, the more conflicts in the society. Due to all these restrictions on women freedom, they leave their country to other countries enjoying all their right in different aspects of the life. No one can deny that a lot of women struggle and lost their life to have their rights without any benefits. Problem of Saudi women remain a complex one where women become the social problem in the country. Women are forbidden their simplest rights. They cannot educate to higher levels or setup in high position or choose their husband. All these problems can be solved in many steps; first the government must put new rules for the society including all rights of women as find in the Quran. Second, women must have the ability to educate, working in political position and have the ability to choose their husband. All other Arabic countries must help them to solve this problem by send professions in these problems.</p>
<p><strong>Women in Syria</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The role of the Syrian women in their country is intensified nowadays in many aspects of life. This is recognized by many organizations in many Europe countries. The traditions of Syrian women is discussed by women called Asma Al Asaad.</p>
<p>The very noble posture of the young, elegantly beautiful Syrian first lady, Asma al-Assad, at the breakfast meeting reminded me of Nizar Kabbani’s words. Kabbani, studying at Damascus University, asks, “Is it the Syrian woman who gives her beauty to Syria, or is it Syria that gives her an inner beauty, nobility and femininity?”</p>
<p>As Asma al-Assad was born and raised in London, she is often asked just how much she has integrated into Syrian culture. The first lady said while she was living in London she went to Syria every summer and never found Syria or its culture strange. She described herself as embodying British-We stern culture. She emphasized they have also started in Syria the kind of revolution developing countries are currently experiencing. She was mostly impressed by the fashion show she watched in Istanbul, and said that the striking synthesis of the traditional and modern in the fashion world could be applied to real life. She firmly believed the traditional and modern will unite. “Turkey is a very good model for us,” Mrs. Assad said, stressing that Turkey with its synthesis is a role model for the region. The greatest obstacles facing women living in freedom and independently are the customs and traditions, she stated in perfect English. Syria does not only lead Turkey by 10.4 percent in the number of women present in Parliament, it also overwhelmingly leads Turkey in women involvement in local politics. However, the woman is identified with her family not as an individual. The concepts of family and honor are binding for women in Arab culture.</p>
<p>Though Mrs. Assad said, “We keep asking for more, and we want more progress,” it is obvious that the women involved in social and political events are all from the upper class. No woman from the middle or lower class can easily break through the invisible barriers. It is known that there were no civil society organizations (CSOs) until three years ago in Syria, where there is tight state control. Mrs. Assad, who heads the first civil society organization that was established by the state, is also the head of the “independent” CSOs, most of them established under state control. The word “feminism” in questions asked on feminism, headscarf and honor killings made her laugh slightly. I think this reaction stemmed from the conceptual structure of feminism in the East. Mrs. Assad tried to explain that there is individualism and an individual behind feminism, but the fact that Syrian culture is based on the family embraces the cultural structure with a different understanding. I listened to her without forgetting the 100 cases of honor killings that appeared in newspapers in 2000-2003. As I was listening to the first lady, I thought about the very colorful and diverse ethnic structure of Syria, where 30 percent of the population are Nusayris.</p>
<p><strong>Her role in the Family</strong></p>
<p>The woman’s role as a mother, sister, wife and aunt is important, not her individual rights and demands. 396 of the 767 business women in Syria are entrepreneurs who have established their own business. The newly established SYEA is the first association founded by young entrepreneurs. When she said, “Syrian women are eager and ambitious,” she made a realistic point, in my opinion. “Women are in secondary positions in the society, and the customs and traditions crush them under the mask of religion. Religion is a very private and individual matter,” she insisted. “What is essential is the Holy Qur’an, not practical religion, and we must look at this,” Mrs. Assad said, adding that she also believed in the importance of reaching a consensus with religious scholars. Hence, they have launched an educational project to make religious scholars work for the betterment of women. This is very important, in my opinion, to get women involved through persuasion and education — not by excluding them…</p>
<p>“The 20th century was that of men, and the 21st century will be that of women,” she said as she was shaking hands with the participants. I believe a woman’s hand should reach out to the Middle East.”</p>
<p><strong>Her role at Work</strong></p>
<p>Nowadays the role of the Arab Syrian women in agriculture is intensified is as Two IFAD evaluations published in 1999 provide an important perspective on the role of women in agriculture. In Syria, farming usually a household activity, except among the wealthier farm households. Information on labour in agriculture shows that the usual pattern is that women are completely responsible for caring for the livestock and poultry. Grazing is the exception: here men do an estimated 37% of the work. In crop production, women participate at all stages.</p>
<p>Women’s farm work in Syria usually involves the following activities:</p>
<p>■planting;</p>
<p>■seeding, thinning, weeding;</p>
<p>■harvesting;</p>
<p>■fruit collection;</p>
<p>■crop residual collection and pruning;</p>
<p>■animal feeding (which often requires frequent trips to the fields to collect fresh fodder); and</p>
<p>■milking and egg collection.</p>
<p>However, <em>Syrian women have little role in marketing. </em>In 91 % of households, marketing is a male task. There are obvious implications for control of income generated from the sale of produce or livestock. Rural women in Syria also tend to have little decision-making power within the household on the disposal of family income.</p>
<p>A sociological survey of married rural women found that two thirds of them spent an average of six hours working outside the home. The other third spent seven to ten hours. While much of this time is likely to be spent on the above agricultural tasks, some also goes to fuel and water collection, particularly where sources are far from the home. In addition, women spend a considerable amount of time on work within the home, such as baking bread, preparing meals and looking after children and the elderly. Like women everywhere, they try to combine household tasks and productive tasks.</p>
<p><em>Women’s labour input is disproportion^ to their control of agricultural resources. </em>An FAO study in Syria found the following pattern of ownership among women:</p>
<ul>
<li>land: only 5%</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>animals: about 7%-8%, but with variation according to the type of livestock and the area of the country (males own about 97% of sheep, 93% of cows, 96% of goats and even 98% of chickens); and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Agricultural machinery: 1%.</li>
</ul>
<p>The agrarian reform of the late seventies redistributed land to all farmers, and Shari’s law recognizes the right of women to inherit. But practice has not yet caught up with the law. Most Syrian women are apparently culturally pressured to waive their right to land inheritance in favour of their brothers or sons.</p>

<p><strong><em><u>Introduction: </u></em></strong></p>
<p>A few years ago the “Time” magazine of the united states close the computer as the “Man of the year” perhaps recognizing the contributions of the computer to mankind in the area of business applications, computers have a caused a fundamental change in the way business are conducted. Computer with all the support it offers has now become indispensable tool in the hands at managers for their decision making to run an organization in a proper and efficient manner, computers are in the fore front of the revolution that provides today’s users with the necessary information and knowledge edge to survive and excel in to days business scenario.</p>
<p><strong><em><u>Software: </u></em></strong></p>
<p>A software or a program can be defined as a complete set at written instructions written by the programmer which enables the computer to obtain the solution of problem (with or without data). Software is a general term that is used to describe any single program or group of programs.</p>
<p>Software is the instruction given to a computer to perform the described task without software the computer cannot do anything. A software is a set of instruction written in the prescribed form to get proper result. It acts us an interface between user and the computer,. Thus the complete set of instructions written to solve a problem on a computer is called software.</p>
<p>Software causes the hardware to do work.</p>
<p><strong>EX- WINDOWS XP</strong></p>
<p><em><u>Types of software: </u></em></p>
<p>Basically software programs fall into three types:</p>
<p>1. System software</p>
<p>2. Programming software</p>
<p>3. Application software</p>
<p><strong><em><u>SYSTEM SOFTWARE: </u></em></strong></p>
<p>It facilitates the use of computers by the user and produces an environment to execute application program.</p>
<p>Main part of the software is operating system.</p>
<p>EX- PC DOS, WINDOWS</p>
<p><strong><em><u>Types of system software: </u></em></strong></p>
<p>System software may be divided into the following three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>LANGUAGE</li>
<li>SYSTEM PROGRAMS</li>
<li>SYSTEM UTII.ITIES</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em><u>PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE: </u></em></strong></p>
<p>A set of instructions written for the computer system to perform a task that is used to write the program is called programming language.</p>
<p>EX- BASIC, FORTRON, PASCAL, VISUAL BASIC</p>
<p><strong><em><u>APPLICATION SOFTWARE:</u></em></strong></p>
<p>It is the collection of programs which direct the computer to perform specific tasks resulted by a user such as airline reservation, train reservation and so on. This software is called as application software. Thousands of such programs are available to perform a wide range at business, education and scientific applications.</p>
<p><strong>EX- INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION, BUSINESS SOFTWARE.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Application software</strong> is a subclass of <u>computer software</u> that employs the capabilities of a computer directly and thoroughly to a task that the user wishes to perform. This should be contrasted with <u>system software</u> which is involved in integrating a computer’s various capabilities, but typically does not directly apply them in the performance of tasks that benefit the user. In this context the term <u>application</u> refers to both the application software and its implementation.</p>
<p>Typical examples of <strong>software applications </strong>are <u>word-processorseadsheets,</u> and <u>media planers</u>.</p>
<p>In <u>computer science,</u> an application is a computer program designed to help people perform a certain type of work. An application thus differs from an operating system (which runs a computer), a utility (which performs maintenance or -general-purpose chores), and a <u>programming language</u> (with which computer programs are created). Depending on the work for which it was designed, an application can manipulate text, numbers, graphics, or a combination of these elements. Some application packages offer considerable computing power by focusing on a single task, such as word processing; others, called <u>integrated software,</u> offer somewhat less power but include several applications, such as a word processor, a spreadsheet, and a database program.</p>

<p><strong>Preliminary</strong></p>
<p>A Fabric Defect is any abnormality in the fabric that hinders its acceptability by the consumer. Defect-Free Fabric: A fabric that exhibits a consistent performance within the boundaries of human use &amp; human view. A Fabric that exhibits a consistent appearance within the human sight boundaries. The world produces over 17 million tons of knitted textiles and apparel – representing one third of the global textile market. Moreover, output is forecast to grow by 25% over the next ten years, reaching more than 21 million tons. Knitwear remains the highest contributor to Bangladesh’s exports growth in the fiscal year (2007-08), according to the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB). It again crossed the target of export registering a 21.19 percent growth in the fiscal year (2007-08), compared with the corresponding period of FY 2006-07. US $4.929 billion was earned from knitwear exports against the target of US$4.899 billion for the period in FY 2007-08.Containing 20% cumulative average growth rate knitwear is now the number one export earning sector in our country. In FY 2006-07 the export of knitwear earning was US$ 4553.60 million which was 19.30% more than the previous year. Knitwear is the country’s largest single export item and together with woven products export earnings account for over 75 percent.</p>
<p>Knitwear is well ahead of woven exports, as it is able to take advantage of domestically produced inputs such as yarn. This cuts lead time and makes products more attractive to international buyers. In the July-June period of FY 2007-08 woven garment products worth US$4.63 billion were exported, a 10.62 percent up on a year earlier. Meanwhile, total export earnings reached US$12.64 billion during the period in FY 2007-08, posting a 15.33 percent growth over the corresponding period a year earlier.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Effects of faults in textile</strong></p>
<p>In order to understand the problems you face when buying and selling textile products, you need to understand the materials themselves and this is best done by understanding a little about how they are made. The seminar takes you through the basic principles of textile manufacture and deals with how some materials are more prone to certain problems and why. It also explains why some materials are more expensive than others. This course will introduce you to the basic principles of textile material manufacture the differences between fibers and where they come from, how fibers are turned in to the fine twisted structure that is a yarn, looks at weaving, knitting and non-woven and dyeing, printing and finishing.</p>
<p>To establish a uniform method for determining, quantifying and measuring the quality of warp knit electrometric fabrics, and a method for measuring length, width, and other physical properties.</p>
<p>The appearance of a fabric can be greatly affected if the yarn has a sufficiently pronounced periodic component. The severity of the periodic fault can only be estimated if its intensity is quantified. Even though a spectrogram is more reliable than other tools at determining periodicity, it gives only the resolved mass variation, which may not be present in the final yarn when different faults are superimposed. The relative index of irregularity of yarn is considered as a measure of the intensity of a periodic fault of a spun yarn. By correlating the above index with the relative unevenness indices of finished fabrics knitted from yarn samples produced at different levels of roller eccentricity, we have established the threshold value of the relative index of irregularity of yarn which produces worse appearance values in the fabric.</p>
<p>Mass variation in yarn can adversely affect many properties of textile materials such as shade variations and strength. Mass variation can be attributed to the properties of raw materials, inherent short comings in yarn making and preparatory machines, mechanically defective machinery and/or external causes as a result of working conditions and improper housekeeping.</p>
<p>The variation in mass per unit length of yarn comprises three basic types [9], namely (i) irregularity of a completely random nature, (ii) irregularity of a markedly periodic nature, (iii) irregularity of a quasi-periodic nature. Purely random irregularity forms an unavoidable component of total irregularity, so that a minimum achievable random irregularity can be acceptable for apparel usage.</p>
<p>The periodic irregularities which are found in the spun yarns may be the result of machinery defects such as eccentric drafting rollers, variability in the covering of drafting rollers, inaccurately cut or worn-out drafting rollers and the vibration of drafting rollers [3]. Yarns which are affected by any of these defects occurring in the drafting prior to spinning can appreciably affect the yarn and the resulting fabric.</p>
<p>Periodic mass variations in yarn can cause weft bars, diamond barring effects [3], moiré effects, weft stripes or rings in the resulting fabric [8]. Hence, periodic irregularity should not be permitted at all, since it greatly affects the appearance of fabric and must be controlled. However, the presently available tools used to measure the periodicity of mass per unit length variation have limitations. The spectrogram is more reliable compared to other tools for determining periodicity; it works on the principle of Fourier analysis [8], which sets out any function in a series of sine curves. The actual mass variation will be resolved into different sinusoidal waves with different amplitudes and wavelengths. Hence, spectrogram gives only the resolved mass variation, which may not be present in the final yarn when different faults are superimposed.</p>
<p>The main objective of the present work is to understand these limitations and establish supplementary methods for the available tools which are used to measure the periodicity of mass variation, and to suggest new measures to understand the effect of periodic mass variation of yarn on fabric appearance.</p>
<p><strong>Yarn Faults</strong></p>
<p>It is still not possible to produce a yarn without faults for various reasons. Stickiness of cotton can contribute to the formation of thick and thin places. Fly liberation in Ring frame department is one of the major reasons for short faults in the yarn because of the fly gets spun into the yarn. Hence it is not possible to have fault free yarn from rings pinning, it is necessary to have yarn monitoring system in the last production process of the spinning mill. As physical principle for electronic yarn clearing the capacitive and the optical principle have established. Both principles have their advantages in specific applications.</p>
<p>The yarn faults which go into the woven or knitted fabric can be removed at very high costs or can not be removed at all. Therefore the yarn processing industry demands a fault free yarn.</p>
<p>The difference between frequent yarn faults and seldom occurring yarn faults are mainly given by the mass or diameter deviation and size. These faults are monitored by classmate or clearer installation on winding.</p>

<p><strong>Knittimg Faults</strong></p>
<p>The knitting defect due to the knot is almost the knitting hole caused by the end breakage in plain-weft knitting zone. The end breakage occurs near the knot on the take-down side. The end breakage rate increases together with the increase of the depth of stitch draw, the input tension, the take-down weight, the machine gauge, the coefficient of yarn friction, the step length of cam, and the machine speed. But the increase of the cam angle decreases the end breakage rate.</p>
<p>Shade variation in knitted fabrics is an issue of concern. It could be during dyeing and finishing. Mixing could be a suspect. The problem can be machine related or material related.</p>

<p><strong>Dyeing Faults</strong></p>
<p>While dyeing, large volume of dyestuff, thickening agent and small amount of water are used. Many textile chemicals like Dispersing agent, Leveling agent, Acid buffer etc are used during the process. The dyestuff have to be either fermented (for natural dye) or chemically reduced (for synthetic vat and sulfur dyes) before being applied. This makes the dye soluble so that it can be absorbed by the fiber. Direct dyes are water soluble and can be applied directly to the fiber from an aqueous solution. Most other classes of synthetic dyes, other than vat and sulfur dyes, are also applied in this way.</p>

<p><strong>PRECAUTIONS NEED TO BE TAKEN IN INDUSTRIES:</strong></p>
<p>We followed different batches in different factories. There was a variation of fabric fault% in factory to factory. Eventually we realize that fabric fault% in wet processing industries can not be avoided but we can minimize it. Some technical precautions that can minimize fabric faults% in knit industries are summarized below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Batching section:</strong></li>
<li>Fabric should be equally fed into each nozzle a per batch plan, otherwise there may create problem  in speed controlling, for which running shade mark or unleveled dyeing possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>2)   Workers should be careful during batch</p>
<p>Preparatio</p>
<p>3)   Skilled workers should be employed in this</p>
<p>Section</p>
<p>4)   Batch weight must be taken accurately</p>
<p>5)   Cutting fault during batch sewing should be Minimized.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dyeing Section:</strong></li>
<li>Over scouring must be avoided.</li>
<li>In case of scouring, run time should be compatible with  temp.</li>
<li>Least amount of caustic should be used for better  scouring.</li>
<li>PH of scouring-bleaching must be within 10.5-11.5.</li>
<li>Over enzyme treatment must be avoided.</li>
<li>Amount of enzyme might be used according to its</li>
</ul>
<p>strength.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dyeing should be carried out accurately, RFT (Right-first-time) dyeing suggested for the industries because if topping or addition needed to be done then fabric wastage will increase.</li>
<li>For checking the shade of the batch, workers should cut the samples from a particular space and take smallest sample as possible.</li>
<li>Workers in dyeing section should be skilled and aware of the process losses</li>
<li><strong>Finishing Section:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Generally this section is not responsible for any  type of process loss.</p>
<ul>
<li>Test roll should not be missed or mixed with other batch. It should be returned in the corresponding batch.</li>
<li>Sample cut for GSM check and fastness check should not be too large.</li>
<li>The GSM of the dyed fabric should be taken after conditioning of the fabric.</li>
<li>The responsibility of workers must be noticed and  monitored in the finishing section to reduce fault.</li>
<li>Most common finishing problems in the knit industry is softener spot and crease mark. Precaution should be taken during softener application in dyeing and good quality anti-creasing agent should be used in pretreatment and dyeing. Fabric should be unloaded in the trolley through over flowing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our realization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All the process parameters from scouring to finishing should be followed accurately. Some factories set up process parameters but they are not following these parameters accurately. This practice should be stopped.</li>
<li>Enzyme application in white batches can be done before scouring-bleaching in order to reduce the loss of brightener with the fibres, which occurs in case of enzyme application during/after bleaching.</li>
<li>Good quality chemicals and dyes should be used. Suppose fluctuations in quality and affectivity are the most common problem in enzyme using. Fighting with the tight required pH and temperature range is some times difficult for the factories. So enzyme selection should be based on specificity, required pH range and temperature range.</li>
<li>Some factories use excessive amount of enzyme to ensure better fabric appearance as required by the buyers. This will increase fabric faults%. Again, while enzyme reaction proceeds on fibre, intensive mechanical contact, generated by dyeing m/c results in breaking off the fibre ends, already weakened by enzyme treatment. This practice should be avoided.</li>
<li>We should check required PH during bleaching, enzyme treatment, leveling, dyeing and softening accurately.</li>
<li>Sample should be cut after dye and salt dosing by checking this sample before soda dosing we can ensure about the major faults in color measurements and we can take necessary actions.</li>
<li>After compacting the final weight of the finished fabric should not be taken at hot condition. The fabric should be conditioned properly to gain standard moisture from the atmosphere.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LIMITATIONS</strong></p>
<p>During working with the project we face some problems and our project has many limitations but we try our best to determine the process loss and fabric waste.</p>
<p>The problems/limitations that we faced during the project  work   were:</p>
<ul>
<li>External supervisor from each factory was required for collecting necessary information read for the project.</li>
<li>We failed to find out the process loss during scouring-bleaching and enzyme application in the factories, that is why we had to do this in our own lab.</li>
<li>If we had a sample dyeing m/c then we could perform the job very accurately using the same batch. Because it needs to take the total weight of the fabric after each process to know the practical wt. loss pretreatment.</li>
<li>We collected data and finish the project following only single jersey fabric in the mentioned industries, because of the availability of the s/j fabric batches of similar count and GSM.</li>
<li>There were different opinions from mill to mill G.M against our concept to determine the process loss and fault. But we did what was advised by our supervisor.</li>
<li>We could not compare some batches of one factory to the relevant batch of another factory due to different parameters in various processes, but we mentioned the differences.</li>
<li>We did not get proper help from Niagara and Masco Knit Composite that was required for the project.</li>
<li>In order to facilitate production and supply of quality fabrics of the required quantity from one single unit, it is essential to establish composite textile mills, with required facilities for spinning, weaving and dyeing-printing-finishing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>From the discuss we know that almost all the people of our society are quite familiar with the term textile. Faults of cotton knit fabric is directly related to the relevant process loss during the wet processing. It is an important factor for production. More the fault less the production. For higher production it is necessary to control the faults in knit processing. This can be achieved by following all the parameters of production accurately and by minimizing process losses. We try our level best to find out fabric faults and process parameters of the mentioned three knit factories. If the standard parameters are followed accurately and necessary precautions are taken in the industries for knit batch processing we think that fabric faults can be minimized. But, to create textile, some the happy, carefree and irresponsibility life of manpower in factory is greatly hampered of fabric. Now-a-days the problem of faults in Textile has taken a serious turn. It has gradually extended its claw towards all the sectors of our life. The effective step for the remedy of the problem is to find out first the root cause of the problem. In this connection, the law enforcing authority is liable to let this problem rise to the menacing</p>

<strong><u>Special Powers Act, 1974<br/>
[XIV of 1974]</u></strong><br/>
</span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Section 2(1) and 3—</strong><br/>
Section 3 if authorises detention for protective purpose. It confers on the Government the power to detain an individual for the purpose of preventing him from doing one or other or the 8 prejudicial acts mentioned in section 2(t) (i) to (viii) of the Act and for no Other purpose To keep a particular individual in detention for the purpose of protecting him front the onslaught of others is not contemplated within the four corners of the provision of law. The detenu might have a capability to create problem to public safety and public order, but that by itself cannot be the basis for passing an order of detention so long as he does not indulge himself in any prejudicial act and the members of the public, are not affected. (Per BB Roy Chowdhury J).<br/>
<strong><em>M Mahmood Vs. Bangladesh 43 DLR 372. </em></strong>
<p><strong>Section 2(f)(i)—</strong><br/>
Detention order when void ab initio— Since the District Magistrate has no jurisdiction to pass an order of detention on the grounds enumerated in section 2(f)(i) the present Order of detention is void ab initio.<br/>
<strong><em>Moazzem Hossain Chowdhury Vs. Bangladesh 43 DLR 186.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 2(f) (i)—</strong><br/>
A District Magistrate is not competent to make an order of preventive detention within the meaning of section 2(t) (1)—As it has been found that the initial order of detention passed by the District Magistrate On 31.:1 .89 and the detention of the detenu on the basis of it were illegal, the continuation of this illegal detention by the order of extension passed by the Government on 30.289 (sic) must also be deemed to be illegal. Initial order of detention was extended by a further order of detention with effect from an absurd date 30.2. 1989 whereas the month of February expired on 28.2.1989—Detention order being vague and indefinite is not lawful.<br/>
<strong><em>Khokan Kumar Saha Vs. Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs 42 DLR 164.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sections 2(1) &amp; 16—</strong><br/>
Where the subject matter of theft belongs to the citizen or any other organization or institution theft ipso facto of such property does not become prejudicial t6the economic and financial interest of the State. In the instant case as the motors in question belonged to the Project for irrigation of land of different individuals there is no scope to hold that the theft of the motors was prejudicial to the financial and economic interest of the State.<br/>
<strong><em>Anisuzzaman Vs. State 43 DLR 35.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sections 2(1) and 3(2)—</strong><br/>
Detention— Ground NO. 4 relates to a specific criminal case—All other grounds are vague, Indefinite and lack in material particulars—Detenu’s release ordered by Court.<br/>
<strong><em>AKM Azizul Haque Vs. Bangladesh 42 DLR 189.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sections 2(1), 3 &amp; 8—</strong><br/>
Jurisdictlonal facts for detaining a person—Since the detaining authority is curtailing the liberty of a citizen by detaining him on preventive detention, it is exercising a quasi—judicial authority. To curtail fundamental rights of personal liberty enshrined in the Constitution it is essential that the detaining authority must have reports and materials, that is, jurisdictional facts for exercising power to detain the detenu under the special Powers Act.<br/>
<strong><em>Anisul Islam Mahmood Vs. Bangladesh 44 DLR 1.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sections 2(f) (i), (ii) (viii) and 8—</strong><br/>
Mandatory provision of section 8 of the Act has been violated by the Government by not serving the ground on the detenu that was mentioned in the detention order.<br/>
<strong><em>Rama Rani Bashak Vs. Bangladesh 40 DLR 364.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 2(f)(i), (iii), (v), (vii), (viii),— </strong><br/>
Five different kinds of prejudicial acts were mentioned in the order without being sure as to which exact kind of prejudicial act the detenu was sought to be fastened with.<br/>
<strong><em>Rama Rani Bashak Vs. Bangladesh 40 DLR 364.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sections 2(f) (iii) &amp; 3(i)—</strong><br/>
The Government which passed an independent detention order omitted all other grounds of prejudicial acts except the one defined in section 2(f)(iii) of the Act in the original detention order passed by the ADM—This shows non-application of mind.<br/>
<strong><em>Rama Rani Bashak Vs. Bangladesh 40 DLR 364.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sections 2(f) and 3(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)— </strong><br/>
Authority vested by Special Powers Act in the detaining authority—Detaining Authority’s power to detain a person for preventing him from doing prejudicial acts—Prompt must be taken to prevent the detenu  from committing prejudicial acts any further—No explanation furnished by the detaining I authority as to the fact which prevents the detaining authority from taking prompt action.<br/>
Detention order served after a delay of more than 2 years and 6 months after the incidents of prejudicial activities—No rational nexus between the grounds and the passing of detention order.<br/>
<strong><em>Mahabuba Wahed Vs. Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs 42 DLR 153.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 2(f)(viii)—</strong><br/>
Prejudicial act—Mortgaged machineries attached to the bank— Accused appellant did not commit any act, prejudicial to the economic or financial interest of the Shilpa Bank which comes within the ambit of State by legal fictions as defined in Article 152 of the Constitution.<br/>
<strong><em>Anwar Ali Vs. State 41 DLR 450.</em></strong></p>
<p>Sections 2(f) (VIII) and 16 read with Constitution of Bangladesh 1972 (as amended) Article 152(1) Bangladesh Shilpa Bank Order, 1972 (P0 No. 129 of 1972) Articles 33, 34 and 35—Interpretation of Statute—Bangladesh Shilpa Bank is a statutory public authority within the meaning of Article 152(1) of the Constitution—The liability of the loanee to repay the secured loan being civil in nature, he did not commit any prejudicial act and cannot be convicted under section 16 read with section 2(1) (viii) of Special Powers Act for default in payment of loan.—The Bank is a State by legal fiction. Appropriate remedy for the bank is for action under Articles 33—35 of ‘P0 No. 129 of 1972.<br/>
<strong><em>Anwar Ali Vs. State 41 DLR 450.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 2(g)—</strong><br/>
Report or statement— Whether it is a prejudicial act—A report or a statement which is or likely to be an incitement to the commission of a prejudicial act is a prejudicial act. The legislature made a report or statement whether true or false made by the reporter or the speaker which had the effect or likely to be an incitement to the commission of a prejudicial act not by the maker of the speech, but by his audience being incited by that speech is itself a prejudicial act.<br/>
<strong><em>Mostafizur Rahman Vs. Bangladesh 44 DLR 312.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 3—</strong><br/>
Detaining a person—Extent of satisfaction of the executive authority—The detaining authority is required to be very careful in examining the materials before passing the order of detention. Subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority can be looked into objectively by the High Court Division. The initial order of detention if found illegal the subsequent order of detention also suffers from infirmities.<br/>
<strong><em>Pearu Md. Ferdous Alam Khan for Serajul alam Khan Vs. State 44 DLR 603.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 3—</strong><br/>
The detention order, Annexure ‘A’, did not mention anywhere that the detention of the detenu was considered necessary to prevent him from doing any prejudicial act. Thus on the face of the order itself it is without any legal authority in view of the provision of section 3of the Act.<br/>
<strong><em>Tahera Islam Vs. Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs 4O DLR 193.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 3—</strong><br/>
The purpose for, which the petitioner was taken into detention appears to be realisation of the bank loan.  Such detention was not contemplated in the Act. If anything is payable to the bank as unpaid loan, there are other modes of recovery of the dues as—the loan was obtained under bilateral agreement creating a civil liability. For default in this regard provision of preventive detention under the Special Powers Act cannot be resorted to.<br/>
<strong><em>Mirza Ali Ashraf Vs. State 43 DLR 144.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 3—</strong><br/>
Ground of detention— Capability to create problem cannot be, ground—A capability to create problems to public safety and public order by itself cannot be the basis for passing an order of detention so long as the detenu does not indulge himself in any prejudicial act endangering public safety and public order and the members of the public are not affected by his activities.<br/>
<strong><em>M Mahmood Vs. Bangladesh 43 DLR 372.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 3—</strong><br/>
There is no nexus between the grounds mentioned in the order of detention and the grounds that were subsequently served on the detenu. For this reason also the detention order is liable to be held illegal.<br/>
<strong><em>Tahera Islam Vs. Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs 40 DLR 193.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sections 3 &amp; 8—</strong><br/>
Purpose of detention and grounds—Nexus—In the initial order of detention nothing has been stated about any act of the detenu to be prejudicial to the economic interest of the State which appears to be the ground No. I in the list of grounds supplied to him. There is therefore no nexus between the purpose of detention and the grounds thereof and as such the detention is unauthorised being based on no proper grounds.<br/>
<strong><em>Aminuzzaman Vs. Bangladesh 45 DLR 242.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sections 3 and 8 read with Constitution of Bangladesh (as amended upto date) Article 33 (5)—</strong><br/>
Grounds in the initial order of detention cannot be substituted for separate grounds to be communicated to the detenu.<br/>
<strong><em>Chunnu Chowdhury Vs. District Magistrate 41 DLR 156.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 3(1)—</strong><br/>
When specific case has been stared in relation to the alleged activity of the detent,, the same activity could not in fairness be taken as a reasonable basis for making an order of detention.<br/>
<strong><em>Tahera Islam Vs. Secretary Ministry of Home Affairs 40 DLR 193.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 3(1)—</strong><br/>
No order of detention from 23.8.87 to 26.8.87—illegal order of detention was sought to be legalized by an order of extension with retrospective effect which is not permiissible in law.<br/>
<strong><em>Tahera Islam Vs. Secretary Ministry of Home Affairs 40 DLR 193.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 3(1)—</strong><br/>
Detention—detention to make one inactive to keep the even tempo of life—The Court in an examination of the ground upon which the detaining authority had acted would examine whether in a given case, in the light of the attending facts and circumstances, the authority could be satisfied that a person should be detained in order to make him inactive or rather neutralized so that greater public interest can be ensured. The criterion is the potentiality of his act, its impact on the members of the society.<br/>
<strong><em>Mostafizur Rahman Vs. Bangladesh 44 DLR 312.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 3(1)—</strong><br/>
Detention—Detention with the apprehension that somebody else (students) may endanger public order due to some utterance of the detent, — There is no warrant for the view that for the action or programme of the students (that of proceeding towards the cantonment where the ousted President was then residing) should not be held responsible and that he had been detained not for doing any prejudicial act. A prejudicial act has been defined in section 2of the Special Powers Act to be “any act”. Here the law did not mention the act but made any act to be prejudicial which is intended by the doer of the act or likely to prejudice, which means the reasonable standard of likelihood or possibility to prejudice public order, etc.<br/>
<strong><em>Mostafizur Rahman Vs. Bangladesh 44 DLR 312.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 3(1) (a)—</strong><br/>
Preventive detention— When it is colourable exercise of power—The detention has been based on self—same grounds as were communicated to the detenu on earlier Occasion and declared to be illegal. Repeated recourse to illegal grounds knowing them to be so speaks of a bad mind. In the facts of this case, the preventive 8ctibn of the respondent is nothing but a colourable exercise of power.<br/>
<strong><em>Fazana Huq Vs. Bangladesh 43 DLR 501.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 3(1) (a)—</strong><br/>
There being no nexus between the initial order of detention and the, ground served, the order of detention is without lawful authority.<br/>
<strong><em>Mansur Moazzem Vs. Bangladesh 40 DLR 439.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 3(1) (a)—</strong><br/>
Custody on the plea of conviction—where a prisoner is in custody on the basis of an order of conviction the onus of the respondent is discharged as soon as the return relating to the appellant’s custody ‘shows that there is an order of conviction justifying the custody. But the conviction is to N placed before the court for its satisfaction whether the irregularity in It can be overlooked. The warrant of commitment issued by one not authorized under the law can hardly prove the conviction.<br/>
<strong><em>Nasrin Kader Siddiqui Vs Bangladesh 44 DLR (AD) 16.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 3(1)(a)—</strong><br/>
Detention—Simultaneous proceeding of criminal trial whether permissible—The jurisdiction under the detention law may be invoked when the available evidence does not come up to the standard of judicial proof but is otherwise cogent enough to give rise to a suspicion in the mind of the authority concerned. A preventive dent ion is to prevent a person on mere suspicion that some crime had been done and the same would be repeated and is not a question of proving an allegation by evidence which must be done when a proceeding is drawn under the Penal Code.<br/>
Where a criminal proceeding is essentially on the same subject matter and no other matter than the criminal proceeding, then the proceeding under the normal law of the land would b allowed to be continued and the specific case would negative the necessity of any detention order except it could be shown on evidence or from records that the proceeding would come to a fiasco because there s no possibility of evidence to be produced in court in spite Of attempts made by the prosecution for him tube punished eventually and there is a possibility of has Immediately repeating the same activity an similar manner A criminal proceeding thus would not bar a detention order but there are limitations.<br/>

<strong><em>Alam Ara Huq Vs. Government of Bangladesh 42 DLR 98.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 3(1) (a)—</strong><br/>
The Government if satisfied with respect to any person that with a view to preventing him from doing any prejudicial act at is necessary to do so make an order directing that such person be detained This satisfaction is to precede the order of detention which means that all the materials are to be placed before the Government for forming an opinion that the detention is necessary.<br/>
<strong><em>Faisal Mahbub Vs Bangladesh 44 DLR 168.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 3(1) (a)—</strong><br/>
Preventive detention— Nexus between the incident and the order of detention—The alleged offending acts of the detenu prior to his arrest in September 1987 formed the basis of the satisfaction of the detaining authority as to the necessity of the detention and those had a close link with the passing of the order of detention. The detenu has been in custody since 13.9.87 and there has been a long gap 2—1/2 years between the alleged prejudicial activities and the order of detention when there could legitimately be no material in possession of the detaining authority to show that there was any likelihood of the same being repeated. The detaining authority had, therefore, no material basis to form an opinion of satisfaction for passing the order of detention.<br/>

<p><strong>Section 3(1)(a)—</strong><br/>
Detention order, nature and scope of—This provision requires that before the Government can pass an order of detention it must be satisfied with respect to the individual person that his activities are directed against the object mentioned in the section and that it is necessary to prevent him from acting against it. While empowering the Government to pass a preventive order the section appears to have expressly made it a part of its duty to satisfy itself about the existence of what the law makers regard as condition precedent to the exercise of that power. An order being indicative of the Stale of the mind of the authority making it, the concerned order of detention must expressly state that the Government is at it is necessary to make the Order to prevent the individual from doing any prejudicial act. If the order is silent in this respect the detention will be not in terms of the section.<br/>

<p><strong>sections 3(1)(a)(2)(3), 10, 11 &amp; 12—</strong><br/>
This decision deals with the implication of section 10, 11 and 12 of the Special Powers Act read with Article 3 3(4) of the Constitution regarding the placing of the case of the detenu within the statutory period of 120 days (as I section 10) before the Advisory  Board, sending of the report of the Advisory Board containing Its opinion to the Government within 170 days as per section 11— and the legal necessity of the Government to confirm or revoke the order of detention (arid in case of confirmation pass further order for continuation of detention serving the same on the detenu) which in effect means that continuation of an order —of detention for indefinite period, even if initially otherwise va1id becomes illegal either on 120th day due to contravention of section 10, or on 170th day due to the contravention of the provisions of sections 11 and 12 of the Special Powers Act or on 180th day if the provision of section 12 of the said Act read with Art. 33(4) of the Constitution is not complied wish.<br/>

<strong><em>Mrs. Nabila Chowdhury Vs. Government of Bangladesh 41 DLR 345.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 3(2)(3)—</strong><br/>
Habeas Corpus— Extension of detention after expiry of initial period of detention—Order dated 2.5.1989 by the Ministry of Home Affairs was made after the expiry— of 30 days from the date of first order of detention by the Additional District Magistrate. The Government have not been authorised to— extend the period of detention with retrospective effect. The detenu is therefore detained under—an illegal order of detention and is directed to be released forthwith.<br/>
<strong><em>Momtaz Sultana Vs. Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs 42 DLR 457.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 3 (2)(3)—</strong><br/>
Detention order under section 3(2) remains in force for 30 days after the making thereof unless in the meantime it is approved by the Government. After the expiry of 30 days on 174 1987, the detention order is without any lawful authority as it was not extended within 30 days.<br/>

<p><strong>Sections 3, 3(2) and 8(1)—</strong><br/>
Detenu cannot be detained under section 3(2) of the Act on vague and indefinite ground served under section 8 of the Act as it does not enable him to make an effective presentation against his detention. [Relied on 31 DLR (AD) 1]<br/>
Pendency of a specific criminal case against detenu cannot be the ground for detaining him under section 3 of the Special Powers Act. 40 DLR 193 relied on.<br/>
<strong><em>Abdul Hakim Miah Vs. Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs 42 DLR 219.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 3(3)—</strong><br/>
Fourth and last order of detention was dated 8.7.89—This was passed in confirmation of order of detention dated 11.3.89 which was found to be illegal—Thus the order dated 8.7.89 which was in confirmation of an illegal order was also patently illegal.<br/>
The last order was passed under section 3 (3) of the Act. An order under this provision of the Act is passed by the Government in approval of an order passed by the District Magistrate/Additional District Magistrate. In the instant case no order of detention was passed by either District Magistrate—Additional District Magistrate detaining the detenu. It was an order where the detaining authority has not applied its, mind and has acted mindlessly, nervously and desperately.<br/>
<strong><em>Alam Ara Huq Vs. Government of Bangladesh 42 DLR 98.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 3(3)—</strong><br/>
Non—application of mind in the matter of detention makes the order of detention illegal—Any order of detention not ‘a signed by a competent officer cannot be treated as a valid order of detention.<br/>

<strong><em>Saleha Chowdhury Vs Government Bangladesh 40 DLR 207. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 3(3)—</strong><br/>
Detention of the detenu  after the expiry of 30 days (From 18.3.1987 to 17.4.1987) cannot be extended  by an order— dated 5.10.1987 when the said detention was not legally in existence on and from 18.4.1987—Detention order Is illegal—Detenu is entitled to be released.<br/>
<strong><em>Saleha Chowdhury. Vs Government of Bangladesh 40 DLR 207.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 7(b)—</strong><br/>
Direction upon absconding — person following order of his detention— Validity of such direction —When the order of detention is a nullity and — subsequent notification under section 7(b) ot the Special Powers Act also becomes a nullity and  void ab initio and the consequential proceeding before the Special Tribunal under the  said section 7(b) for non—compliance such null and void order becomes illegal and without lawful authority. In the instant case the order of detention is void ab initio because the detaining authority did not at all have before it “the junsdactional facts” to enable it to form its opinion that the person concerned should be detained for preventing him from acting in pre judicial manner and also because the involvement grounds given for preventive detention do not come within the meaning of the expression “prejudicial act” as define under section 2(f) of the Act.<br/>
<strong><em>Anisul Islam Mahmood Vs. Bangladesh 44 DLR 1.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 7(1)(b)—</strong><br/>
Indictment proceeding against a detenu— question of its legality or otherwise at the time when It was initiated and  at subsequent time—An order would be deemed to be a warrant of arrest from the Court of Magistrate; if the detenu would  violate the warrant he would be a  fugitive from justice. His failure to comply with direction to surrender would immediately attract the mischief of prosecution and consequent punishment. The offence would be complete on failure to surrender, subject however, to the defence of impossibility of performance which is a matter of fact to be decided on evidence. Section 7(l)(b) is a punitive provision to come into play immediately after the lapse of time, for surrender. The contention that the detentions order being illegal the detenu had not rightly surrendered has little substance. It is not the order of detention but it is the fact of detention itself that matters. At the time it was initiated the proceeding was not prohibited by any law nor was it taken in violation of any law. It need not therefore be quashed at the present stage.<br/>
<strong><em>Anwar Hossain Monju Vs. State 43 DLR 447.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 8—</strong><br/>
Detention—It is now an established principle of law that the allegations out of which specific case is started are not proper grounds for preventive detention.<br/>
<strong><em>Aminuzzaman Vs. Bangladesh 45 DLR 242.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 8—</strong><br/>
Grounds of detention—The detaining authority is under an obligation to furnish definite grounds as well as adequate particulars to the detenu so as to enable him to make a meaningful, representation against the detention. This obligation stems from the statutory right of the detenu embodying the constitutional mandate of Article 33 5). No detenu should suffer because of vagueness of grounds or of the fact that the evidence against him is not brought to his notice. The grounds in this case being extremely vague and indefinite the detenu was denied the opportunity to make an effective representation and consequently his detention has been rendered illegal.<br/>
<strong><em>Farzana Huq Vs. Bangladesh 43 DLR 501.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 8—</strong><br/>
Communication of grounds— Its importance—When a ground is not specifically stated in the document communicated to the detenu under section 8 of the Special Powers Act the same cannot be used by the detaining authority to defend its preventive action as the detenu gets no opportunity to make any representation in respect thereof.<br/>
<strong><em>M Mahmood Vs. Bangladesh 43 DLR 372.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 8—</strong><br/>
Grounds of detention— Whether the detention order would fall to the ground if the second ground of detention, out of two grounds, is found to be  a malafide addition—The contention that the entire detention order would suffer from illegality as the second ground of detention could not be a pre—existing material at the time the impugned order was passed is of no substance because this ground was not before the detaining authority at the time the detention order was made and cannot thus be availed of by the detaining authority and the same must be left out of consideration. The first ground itself is a self—sufficient ground and good enough for the satisfaction of the detaining authority to pass the order of detention.<br/>
<strong><em>Mostafizur Rahman Vs. Bangladesh 44 DLR 312.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 8—</strong><br/>
Every citizen has an inalienable right to be treated in accordance with law—Mere insertion of a section of some law In the order of detention is not enough. The provision of law must be strictly followed. Under Article 102(2) (b) of the Constitution the Court is to be satisfied that the detenu is not being held in custody without lawful authority—the Court is t see whether the grounds of detention supplied to the detenu are supported by materials.<br/>
<strong><em>Faisal Mahbub Vs. Bangladesh 44 DLR 168.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 8—</strong><br/>
It is thus amply clear from the reasons stated in the order made under section 8 the Special Powers Act, 1974 containing the grounds of detention that no reasonable person could be satisfied about the necessity to detain the detenu.<br/>
<strong><em>Dr. Habibullah Vs. Secretary MO Home Affairs 41 DLR 160.</em></strong></p>
<p>Section 8—Fresh grounds not having been served within 15 days on the detenu, the respondents had no legal capability of adding or substituting any more grounds—Detention of the detenu illegal.<br/>
<strong><em>Alam Ara Huq Vs. Government of Bangladesh 42 DLR 98.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 8—</strong><br/>
‘Grounds’ must include facts as well. Grounds are not only necessary to enable the defence to make representation— they are the starting points both for Advisory Board and the High Court Division for discharging their obligations.<br/>
If the detenu asks for further particulars the Government may refuse to disclose a more facts on the ground of public interest. Section 8 of the Act requires that all grounds are to be given to the detenu and under the proviso to that section no ground can be withheld and only those fats may be disclosed whose disclosure is considered not to be against the public interest.<br/>
<strong><em>Habiba Mahmud Vs. Bangladesh 45 DLR (AD) 89.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 8(1)—</strong><br/>
Ground Nos. 3, 4, 5 and7 being vague, indefinite and lacking In necessary particulars as to date, time and manner of detenu’s involvement in the activities, no effective representation could be made under section 8(1).<br/>
<strong><em>Khokan Kumar Saha Vs. Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs 42 DLR 164</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 8(2)—</strong><br/>
Grounds of detention to be served within 15 days from the date of order of detention—Order of detention passed and. served on 24.1.87 and grounds of detention I served on 14.2.87 after 21 days from the date1 of detention—Order of detention suffers from legal infirmity.<br/>
<strong><em>Khair Ahmed Vs. Ministry of Home 40 DLR 353.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 8(2)—</strong><br/>
Interpretation of Statute— Expression “not later than fifteen days from the date of detention”—Meaning of—Detenu’s valuable legal right to make representation or to move the Court at once involved.<br/>
The said extraordinary provision adding the expression “but not later than fifteen days from the date of detention” does not give a general licence to the Ministry of Home Affairs or to the District Magistrate, Additional District Magistrate to cause service of the order containing the grounds of detention in a. leisurely way within 15 days in every case deliberately to deprive the detenu of his. Valuable legal right to make effective representation at the earliest possible opportunity to the appropriate authority or to, move the Court at once.<br/>
<strong><em>Dr. Md. Habibullah Vs. Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs 41 DLR160.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 8(2)—</strong><br/>
Preventive detention— Detaining authority must keep in view Article 33(5) of the Constitution—Grounds to be communicated at the earliest to the detenu regarding the order of detention.<br/>
The detaining authority must always keep in view Article 33(5) of the Constitution which provides that the authority making the order for preventive detention shall, as soon as may be, communicate to the detained person the grounds on which the order of detention has been made and the Legislature in section 8(2) of Special Powers Act has taken pains to specifically direct the detaining authority to cause service of the. order containing the detailed grounds of detention at the time of detention, that is, at the very moment he is detained under the order of preventive detention.<br/>
<strong><em>Dr. Md. Habibullah Vs. Secretary Ministry of Home Affairs4l DLR 160.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Section 10—</strong><br/>
Grounds of detention to be placed mandatorily before the Advisory Board within 120 days from the date of detention on failure of which the detention will be an illegal one after the expiry of 120 days from the date of detention. Detenu directed to be released.<br/>

<strong><em>Khair Ahmed Vs. Ministry of Home 40 DLR 353.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 11(1)—</strong><br/>
whether the High Court should pronounce its decision or has to wait till the Advisory Board reports its opinion to the Govt within the period provided in section 11(1).<br/>
In case of preventive detention where ordôr containing grounds of detention have been served on the detenu within the prescribed time, a question arises whether this Court should pronounce its decision or has to wait till the Advisory Board reports its opinion to the Govt. within the period provided in section 11(1) of the Special Powers Act.<br/>
<strong><em>Dr. Md. Habibullah Vs. Secretary Ministry of Home Affairs 41 DLR 160.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 16—</strong><br/>
where the subject matter of theft belongs to the citizen or any other organisation or institution theft ipso facto of such property does not become prejudicial to the economic and financial interest of the State. In the instant case as the motors in question belonged to the Project for irrigation of land of different individuals there is no scope to hold that the theft of the motors was prejudicial to the financial and economic interest of the State.<br/>

Whether the arrest of the detenu who occasionally visits Bangladesh has any rational nexus with the increase of prices of smuggled cigarettes or with the suspicion that he has a role in the smuggling of cigarettes.<br/>
<strong><em>Dr. Md. Habibullah Vs. Secretary Ministry of Home Affairs 41 DLR 160.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 25 and 25(b)—</strong><br/>
Smuggling of rationed goods is an offence triable under section 25B of the Special Powers Act—Accusation under section 25 of the Act which does not relate to smuggling has prejudiced the defence—Conviction on this score is unsustainable.<br/>
<strong><em>Siddiqur Rahman Vs. State 41 DLR 173.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 258—</strong><br/>
Smuggling—that the seized articles are contraband goods must be proved by. the prosecution—That the goods were of Indian origin have to be established for convicting the appellants—Individual liability of each of the appellants ought to have been considered—seized articles were donated to the Relief Fund without the Court’s permission, which prejudiced the prosecution case—the practice of disposal of the seized articles (alamats) pending trial of the case disapproved.<br/>
<strong><em>Rouf Mia Vs. State 40 DLR 348.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 25B—</strong><br/>
since no offence was committed as found by the Special Tribunal in respect of the goods seized from the petitioner, the petitioner’s possession of the property must be deemed to be lawful. The Special Tribunal’s failure to make an order for return of the property has resulted in a miscarriage justice.<br/>
<strong><em>Sree Monoranjan Das Vs. State 40 DLR 485. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 25B &amp; 27—</strong><br/>
taking of cognizance of the case by the Special Tribunal on the basis of a prosecution report submitted by Inspection of Narcotics and Liquor under the Dangerous Drugs Act is bad in law. The Special Tribunal has no jurisdiction to take cognizance or t proceed with trial in such a position.<br/>
<strong><em>Shahidullah Vs. State 45 DLR 640.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sections 258, 26 &amp; 29—</strong><br/>
Cognizance— Scheduled and non—scheduled offences— When the very taking of cognizance of an offence, the framing of accusation and the trial upon charges of both scheduled and non scheduled offences together suffered from complete lack of jurisdiction, this could not at all be considered to be a mere defect in the framing of charges which by aid of section 537 of the CrPC can be cured if prejudice is not caused to the accused. A mere defect in framing of charge by the Court having jurisdiction is one thing while framing of charge without having any jurisdiction is a completely different thing.<br/>

<p><strong>Sections 26 and 27—</strong><br/>
Section 27 of the Special Powers Act is a departure from the provision of section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Special Tribunal alone is empowered to take cognizance of the offence on the report of a Police Officer of the rank of Sub—Inspector and hold trial on the same—Sections 26 and 27 of the Special Powers Act provide for special machinery for investigation and trial by Special Tribunal.<br/>
<strong><em>Taslima Begum Vs. State 42 DLR 136.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 26—</strong><br/>
Plea of misjoinder of offences when not sustainable—Offences which are made punishable both under the general law and the special law exciusivery triable by the Special Tribunal cannot be said to be different offences or non—schedule offences as those offences have been made exclusively triable by the Special Tribunal. As such it cannot be said that the present trial is vitiated by misjoinder of charges and the Special Tribunal had no jurisdiction to make charges of schedule and non—schedule offences.

<p><strong>Section 27(1)—</strong><br/>
Quashing of proceeding under Special Powers Act—In matters of cognizance of offences triable exclusively by the Special Tribunal under the Special Powers Act initial cognizance of offence by a Magistrate in the manner provided in the Code of Criminal Procedure has no application.<br/>
In an application for quashment of proceeding on the ground of expiry of period of limitation for investigation, the provisions of section 167(5) of the Code applies only to cases in which the Magistrate can take initial cognizance and does not apply to cases exclusively triable by the Tribunal. On this ground the application for quashing is summarily rejected.<br/>
<strong><em>Mahbubur Rahman Vs. State 42 DLR 375.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 27(1)—</strong><br/>
It has been asserted that the impugned order of the learned Upzila Magistrate is palpably illegal as he had no authority to take cognizance of the offence under the Special Powers Act and as such he was not competent to accept the final report submitted by the police and to discharge the accused opposite party and to direct return of the goods.<br/>
Held—As the Magistrate was not competent to take cognizance of the offence under section 27(1) of the Special Powers Act, the impugned order appears to have been passed by the learned Magistrate illegally and without lawful authority.<br/>
<strong><em>State Vs. Satya Narayi, Sarada 43 DLR 529.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 27(l) (4)—</strong><br/>
Power conferred on Special Tribunal by section 27(1) to take cognizance of any case relating to the Act on police report and also under section 27(4) to direct the Police Officer to make further investigation cannot be exercised by the Session Judge in the revisional jurisdiction under sections 435 and 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/>
<strong><em>Satya Ranjan Sarda Vs. State 42 DLR 142.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 27(6)—</strong><br/>
Trial in absentia without proper notification—As the trial was held under provision of the Special Powers Act, the notification of the trial regarding abscondence of the accused persons should have been made by the Special Tribunal. The notification done by the Magistrate who had transferred the case before the Special Tribunal for trial suffers from gross irregularity, if not illegality as well, in the matter. In such circumstances the accused did not get the opportunity of cross—examining the witnesses. The case should therefore go on remand to the Special Tribunal for retrial, especially in view of the irregularity in the notification regarding abscondence of the accused. The impugned judgment and conviction is, therefore, set aside and the case is sent back on remand for retrial.<br/>

it was still obligatory to publish in official Gazette a direction on the accused to appear before the Court before taking up the trial if the accused was considered absconding because of their absence.<br/>

<div class=""entry-content"">
<p>1.1 A Brief History of Measurement System</p>
<p>Weights and measures are among the earliest tools invented by man. Man understandably turned first to parts of his body and his natural surroundings  measuring instruments. Early Babylonian and Egyptian records, and the Bible, indicate that length was first measured with the forearm, hand, or finger and time was measured by the periods of the sun, moon, and other heavenly bodies.</p>
<p>The ancient English system “digit”, “palm”, “span” and “cubic” units of length slowly lost preference to the length units “inch”, “foot” and “yard”.</p>
<p>Roman contributions include the use of 12 as a base number (the foot is divided into 12 inches) and the words from which we derive many of our present measurement unit names. For example, the 12 divisions of the Roman “pes” or foot were called unciae. Our words “inch” and “ounce” are both derived from that Latin word.</p>
<p>The “yard” as a measure of length can be traced back to early Saxon kings. They wore a sash or girdle around the waist that could be removed and used as a convenient measuring device. The word “yard” comes from the Saxon word “gird” meaning the circumference of a person’s waist.</p>
<p>Tradition holds that King Henry I decreed that a yard should be the distance from the tip of his nose to the end of his outstretched thumb. The length of a furlong (or furrow-long) was established by early Tudor rulers as 220 yards. This led Queen Elizabeth I to declare in the 16th century, that henceforth the traditional Roman mile of 5000 feet would be replaced by one of 5280 feet, making the mile exactly eight furlongs and providing a convenient relationship between the furlong and the mile.</p>
<p>The need for a single worldwide coordinated measurement system was recognized over 300 years ago.</p>
<p>In 1790, the Commission appointed by the French Academy created a system that was, at once, simple and scientific. The unit of length was to be a portion of the Earth’s circumference. Measures for capacity (volume) and mass were to be derived from the unit of length, thus relating the basic units of the system to each other and to nature. Furthermore, larger and smaller multiples of each unit were to be created by multiplying or dividing the basic units by 10 and its powers. This feature provided a great convenience to users of the system, by eliminating the need for such calculations as dividing by 16 (to convert ounces to pounds) or by 12 (to convert inches to feet). Similar calculations in the metric system could be performed simply by shifting the decimal point Thus, the metric system is a “base-10” or “decimal” system.</p>
<p>The initial metric unit of mass, the “gram,” was defined as the mass of one cubic centimeter (a cube that is 0.01 meter on each side) of water at its temperature of maximum density. The cubic decimeter (a cube 0. 1 meter on each side) was chosen as the unit for capacity. The fluid volume measurement for the cubic decimeter was given the name “liter.”</p>
<p>By 1900 a total of 35 nations – including the major nations of continental Europe and most of South America – had officially accepted the metric system.</p>
<p>In 1960, the General Conference on Weights and Measures, the diplomatic organization made up of the signatory nations to the Meter Convention, adopted an extensive revision and simplification of the system. Seven units — the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), the ampere (for electric current), the Kelvin (for thermodynamic temperature), the mole (for amount of substance), and the candela (for luminous intensity) were established as the base units for the system. The name System International d’unites (International System of Units), with the international abbreviation SI, was adopted for this modern metric system.</p>
<p>The Bangladesh Government has promulgated an ordinance named “The Standards of Weights and Measures Ordinance, 1982” (Ordinance No. XII of 1982) and under this Ordinance a rules named “The Bangladesh Standards of Weights and Measures Rules, 1982” and empowered the authority to Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI) to introduction and implementation of Metric System in Bangladesh.</p>

It is based at the Pavilion de Britoil in Sevres, France, granted to the Bureau in 1876.</p>
<p>The International Bureau of Weights and Measures (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language"">French</a>: Bureau international des poids et mesures), is an international <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standards_organization"">standards organization</a>, one of three such organizations established to maintain the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units"">International System of Units</a> (SI) under the terms of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_Convention"">Metre Convention</a> (Convention due Metre). The organization is usually referred to by its French <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym_and_initialism"">initialize</a>, BIPM.</p>
<p>The other organizations that maintain the SI system, also known by their French initializes are the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures"">General Conference on Weights and Measures</a> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language"">French</a>: Conférence générale des poids et mesures) (CGPM) and the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_for_Weights_and_Measures"">International Committee for Weights and Measures</a> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language"">French</a>: Comité international des poids et mesures) (CIPM).</p>

<p>4.3  Base Units of System International (SI)</p>
<p>4.3.1  SI Base Units</p>
<p>The International System of Units (SI) defines seven units of measure as a basic set from which all other SI units are derived. These SI base units and their physical quantities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>meter for length</li>
<li>kilogram for mass</li>
<li>second for time</li>
<li>ampere for electric current</li>
<li>Kelvin for temperature</li>
<li>candela for luminous intensity</li>
<li>mole for the amount of substance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The SI base quantities form a set of mutually independent dimensions as required by dimensional analysis commonly employed in science and technology.  However, in a given realization of these units they may well be interdependent, i.e. defined in terms of each other:</p>
<p>The names of all SI units are written in lowercase characters (e.g., the meter has the symbol m), except that the symbols of units named after persons are written with an initial capital letter (e.g., the ampere has the uppercase symbol A).</p>

<p>4.3.2  Symbols of SI Base Units at a Glance</p>
<p>4.3.3  SI Derived Units</p>
<p>Other quantities, called derived quantities, are defined in terms of the seven base quantities via a system of quantity equations. The SI derived units for these derived quantities are obtained from these equations and the seven SI base units. Examples of such SI derived units are given in Table 4.2, where it should be noted that the symbol 1 for quantities of dimension 1 such as mass fraction is generally omitted.</p>

<p>5.1  Electronic Balance</p>
<p>The modern electronic balance is a deceptively simple device. To use it well and get good results, we must understand how it works, and what precautions we must take when handling samples to get the precision we need for good laboratory practice.</p>
<p>When we press Tare, the balance readout is simply set to zero. When we use Calibrate, a known weight is internally placed on the balance, and the electronics are recalibrated to provide the exact magnetic current to the electromagnet to balance the weight as displayed.</p>
<p>5.2  Working Standards</p>
<p>A weight is a piece of material, usually metal, of known mass and usually of known uncertainty. The OIML definition of a weigh is ‘‘A material measure of mass, regulated in regard to its physical and metrological characteristics: shape, dimensions, material, surface quality, nominal value and maximum permissible error’’.</p>
<p>According to the OIML R111 publication, there are seven classes of weights (Classes: E1, E2, F1, F2, M1, M2 and M3) in tiers of uncertainty, with E1 as the highest class. The uncertainty of calibration and change in mass are assigned to each class and are included in the uncertainty budget of the task. A summary chart appears in the following table:</p>

<p>5.3  Environmental Conditions, Suitability for Calibration</p>
<p>The environmental conditions (air currents, vibrations, stability of the weighing site) shall be suitable for the instrument to be calibrated. In particular, operational disturbances due to contamination or damage must be avoided. The weight values must be unequivocally indicated and indications, where given, shall be easily readable.</p>
<p>The user of the instrument shall be asked to ensure that the customary working conditions prevail during the calibration. In this way the interference effects of air currents, vibrations and inclination of the measuring platform will be inherent to the measured values and will therefore be incorporated in the determined uncertainty.</p>
<p>5.4  Preparation for the Calibration of the Weighing Instrument</p>
<p>All details of the operation manual regarding the setting up, the environmental conditions, the technical specifications (Max, d, linearity and temperature coefficient), as well as the adjustment and calibration process should be taken into account.</p>
<p>The most important thing for the reliable operation of a weighing instrument is a location free from vibrations and draughts. If the required conditions are not fulfilled, the calibration process must not be carried out. Before the calibration of the weighing instrument, the following preliminary checks should be realized:</p>
<p>Visual Check.</p>
<p>Cleaning Check.</p>
<ul>
<li>Functionality Check.</li>
<li>Leveling Check.</li>
<li>Pre-Load.</li>
<li>Adjustment.</li>
<li>Temperature.</li>
</ul>
<p>5.5  Acclimatization Time</p>
<p>Reaching the operating temperature is a prerequisite for every test. Therefore the warm-up time should be looked up in the operating instruction manual.</p>
<p>If details of the warm-up time are missing, choose the right warm-up time within the following table:</p>

<p>6.1  Thermometer</p>
<p>Thermometers measure temperature, by using materials that change in some way when they are heated or cooled. Modern thermometers are calibrated in standard temperature units such as Fahrenheit or Celsius and Kelvin.</p>
<p>6.2  Resistance Thermometer</p>
<p>Resistance thermometers are usually made using platinum, because of its linear resistance-temperature relationship and its chemical inertness. The platinum detecting wire needs to be kept free of contamination to remain stable. A platinum wire or film is supported on a former in such a way that it gets minimal differential expansion or other strains from its former, yet is reasonably resistant to vibration. RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector) assemblies made from iron or copper are also used in some applications.</p>
<p>Commercial platinum grades are produced which exhibit a temperature coefficient of resistance 0.00385/°C (0.385%/°C) The sensor is usually made to have a resistance of 100 Ω at 0 °C. This is defined in BS EN 60751:1996 (taken from IEC 60751:1995). The American Fundamental Interval is 0.00392/°C, based on using a purer grade of platinum than the European standard. The American standard is from the Scientific Apparatus Manufacturers Association (SAMA), who are no longer in this standards field. As a result the “American standard” is hardly the standard even in the US.</p>
<p>Measurement of resistance requires a small current to be passed through the device under test. This can cause resistive heating, causing significant loss of accuracy if manufacturers’ limits are not respected, or the design does not properly consider the heat path. Mechanical strain on the resistance thermometer can also cause inaccuracy. Lead wire resistance can also be a factor; adopting three- and four-wire, instead of two-wire, connections can eliminate connection lead resistance effects from measurements  three-wire connection is sufficient for most purposes and almost universal industrial practice. Four-wire connections are used for the most precise applications.</p>
<p>6.3  Standard Platinum Resistance Thermometer (SPRT)</p>
<p>SPRT consists of spectrally pure platinum wire which is wound free from mechanical stresses. Resistance thermometers use electrical resistance and require a power source to operate. The resistance ideally varies linearly with temperature. This thermometer can be used up to 6600 C. RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector) assemblies made from iron or copper are also used in some applications. SPRT ensures high accuracy, low drift and wide operating range and it is suitable for precession applications.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>6.4  Environmental Conditions</p>
<p>Calibration can be carried out in laboratory. The calibration performed in ambient conditions under normal atmospheric pressure, temperature 23°C ± 5°C and a relative humidity 50% ± 20%.</p>
<p>6.5  Preparation for the Calibration of Thermometers</p>
<p>Calibration of the thermometer is performed before any adjustments take place. The calibrator is operated in the vertical position.</p>
<p>All measurements are to be carried out with the top of the block or bath exposed or insulated, as recommended by the manufacturer and described in the calibration certificate of the temperature block or bath calibrator.</p>
<p>All measurements are to be carried out in such a way that the standard and test thermometers sensors are placed in the homogeneous zone of the temperature calibrator.</p>
<p>6.5.1  Visual Check</p>
<p>Visually examine the thermometers of obvious defects that would affect the accuracy. Furthermore, if the thermometer consists of thermocouples or other probes as sensors look for obvious signs of mechanical defects, contamination, etc. which shall be recorded and the client informed if the laboratory feels that the validity or uncertainty of measurement in the calibration could be impaired.</p>
<p>6.5.2  Initial Zero Point Check</p>
<p>Before the placement of the thermometer under calibration in the temperature bath zero point is  checked in the ice bath.</p>
<p>The low uncertainty of the reference standard thermometers requires a carefully prepared ice bath to maintain the temperature of the reference probe at 0 °C. A properly prepared ice bath will have an expanded uncertainty of 2 mK.</p>
<p>The ice for the ice bath should be finely-crushed or shaved ice that has been prepared from distilled water. The ice should be saturated with distilled water, and then packed gently into an insulating Dewar flask, such that ice fully fills the volume of the flask with no large voids. A cylindrical flask (7 cm inner diameter and 30 cm deep) having a polyethylene-foam cover, 2.5 cm thick, is used. Other flask geometries are allowable, provided the flask is at least 6 cm inner diameter and 30 cm deep, and the thickness of the cover is in the range 1.5 cm to 3 cm. The level of the ice-water mixture should be within 5 mm of the bottom surface of the cover. The cover should have a hole of adequate diameter in the center, to allow insertion of the temperature probe into the ice point. The probe should be inserted until the stop on the probe is butted against the flask cover. Since the ice in the Dewar flask will tend to float as the ice melts, a rubber band should be used to secure the cover onto the flask.</p>
<p>The use of electronic ice-point compensators, extension wires, and automated ice points cooled with thermoelectric modules is not recommended unless a careful analysis of the additional uncertainties is performed. These devices, in general, contribute additional errors to the measurements.</p>
<p>When it is possible use a Triple Point of Water (TPW) cell to maintain the reference thermometer at a temperature of 0.01 °C.</p>
<p>6.6  Calibration Procedure of Standard Platinum Resistance Thermometer</p>
<p>The calibration of the thermometer is achieved by comparison against a standard thermometer when both are placed in a temperature calibrator. Both the standard thermometer and the test thermometer are maintained in an isothermal region so comparisons can be possible.</p>
<p>The temperature calibrator shall have a zone of sufficient temperature homogeneity (referred to as measurement zone). The homogeneous zone will in general be at the lower end of the boring or bath. If the homogeneous zone is situated at another place, this is explicitly stated in the calibration certificate of the temperature calibrator.</p>
<p>Thermometers are calibrated by comparison with standard thermometer, in thermally stabilized temperature calibrators suitable for the calibration by comparison techniques. The standard thermometer and the temperature calibrator shall be traceable to national standards.</p>
<p>6.6.1  Immersion of Thermometers in the Temperature Bath</p>
<p>Immersion of the standard Pt 100 and the thermometer under calibration in the temperature bath is realized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bath is powered ON.</li>
<li>The reference Pt 100 is sunk inside the bath and it is stabilized via stanchion. The immersion depth is the largest possible and it is placed near the side from where the operator takes the measurements.</li>
<li>The under calibration thermometer is also sunk inside the bath and is stabilized via stanchion.</li>
<li>The two sensors are placed the nearest possible to one each other. The maximum number of thermometers that can be calibrated simultaneously is three (for liquid in glass the maximum number is two).</li>
<li>The reference sensor is suitably connected with its digital indicator for the running temperature to be recorded.</li>
<li>The two sensors remain immersed for all the duration of measurement.</li>
</ul>
<p>6.6.2  Measuring Points</p>
<p>The bath is set at the proper temperatures placing its set point at the corresponding values.</p>
<p>The number of temperature points (from 3 to 5) are selected in such a way for to correspond in roughly equal intervals in the measuring range.</p>
<p>In each reference temperature and after the stabilization of the bath, we wait 15 more minutes  in order thermal balance to be restored.</p>
<p>Under stabilization conditions the measurements of temperature from the reference thermometer are recorded (A circle: 10 values with minimum time interval between them 5 sec).</p>
<p>The measurements of temperature from the thermometer under calibration are recorded (B circle: 10 values with minimum time interval between them 5 sec).</p>
<p>The measurements of temperature from the reference thermometer are repeated again and recorded (A circle: 10 values with minimum time interval between them 5 sec).</p>
<p>The mean values of the two measuring cycles from the reference thermometer must not be different more than two times the bath stability (0.02 0C).</p>
<p>Calibration of the thermometer at other measuring points is realized with the same methodology in increasing only sequence.</p>
<p>6.6.3  Final Zero Point Check</p>
<p>After the check of the thermometer in the measuring points check in zero point is repeated as follows:</p>
<p>Afterwards the end of calibration the reference sensory and the thermometer under calibration are maintained at environmental temperature until thermal balance.</p>
<p>The two thermometers are cleaned with distilled or de ionized water.</p>
<p>The two sensors are immersed in the ice bath in the Dewar vessel.</p>
<p>Indications are recorded as in the initial control of zero.</p>
<p>6.7  Evaluation</p>
<p>The values measured in series at increasing temperatures are averaged for each calibration point. The calibration result (deviation of the standard thermometer from the indication of the test thermometer) is documented in the certificate after the necessary corrections.</p>
<p>6.8  Estimation of the Uncertainty of Measurement</p>
<p>The uncertainty to be stated as the uncertainty of the calibration of the thermometer is the measurement uncertainty with which the standard temperature can be stated.</p>
<p>The following contributions to the uncertainty of measurement shall be taken into account.</p>
<p>6.8.1  Reference Temperature</p>
<p>ti + δti-std-mean + δti-cal + δti-drift + δti-immersion + δti-meter-cal + δti-meter-drift + δti-meter-resolution + δtbath-homogeneity + δtbath-stability                                                                                                           (1)</p>
<p>ti: mean value of the reference temperature (of the 20 measurements with the reference thermometer).</p>
<p>δti-std-mean: The standard uncertainty is the standard deviation of the mean value of the 20 measurements with the reference thermometer.</p>
<p>δti-cal: correction from the calibration certificate of the reference temperature sensor. The standard uncertainty is the half value of that expanded uncertainty U(k=2) reported in the calibration certificate.</p>
<p>δti-drift: correction due to the drift of the reference temperature sensor. It is estimated from the calibration history of the sensor. The corresponding standard uncertainty is estimated from rectangular distribution as Δ(ti+1-ti)/2∙√3.</p>
<p>δti-immersion: correction due to the inadequate immersion of the reference thermometer sensor (it is estimated via 20mm erases of the sensor from its position and record of the change of the temperature indication Δt: u(δti-immersion)= Δtimm/(2∙√3).</p>
<p>δti-meter-cal: correction due to the calibration of the indicator of the reference sensor.</p>
<p>δti-meter-drift: correction due to the drift of the indicator of reference temperature.</p>
<p>δti-meter-resolution: correction due to the resolution of the reference temperature. The estimated correction value is zero with corresponding standard uncertainty d/(2√3).</p>
<p>δtbath-homogeneity: correction due to bath in homogeneity. The estimated correction value is zero with corresponding standard uncertainty Δthomog/(2∙√3), where Δthomog is the maximum difference of the single values of the temperature indications taken from the reference thermometer at the two positions where the standard sensor and the under calibration thermometer are situated. Alternatively the bath homogeneity can be estimated through the procedure described in WI-T03.</p>
<p>δtbath-stability: correction due to bath instability. The estimated correction value is zero with corresponding standard uncertainty Δtbath-stability/(2∙√3), where Δtbath-stability is the difference between maximum and minimum temperature indications during 20 min. Alternatively the bath stability can be estimated through the procedure described in WI-T03.</p>
<p>In case where the indicator and sensor have been calibrated as one system the terms δti-cal and δti-meter-cal must be replaced by one term (the same for δti-drift and δti-meter-drift).</p>
<p>The estimated value of most corrections factors is zero with a corresponding however standard uncertainty (with no zero value). The combined uncertainty is estimated via the rule of RSS (Root of Sum of Squares) of all the terms:</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>The uncertainty budget of each reference temperature is presented in the following table (where Ci is the sensitivity factor and equals to 1 cause the mathematical model is linear to all the influenced parameters):</p>

<p>6.8.3  Combined Standard Uncertainty</p>
<p>The combined standard uncertainty for a nominal reference temperature t, is estimated by:</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>6.8.4  Expanded Uncertainty</p>
<p>The uncertainty of the thermometer is expressed as the expanded uncertainty ± Uexp which corresponds to a probability of approximately 95 %. This is k times the combined uncertainty, where k is the coverage factor:</p>
<p>Uexp = k.Ucomb</p>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>The coverage factor k can be estimated from t- student distribution for specific effective degrees of freedom νeff and confidence level. In case where νeff ≥ 100, then k = 2 can be used.</p>
<p>By estimating the effective degrees of freedom from Veff of the combined standard uncertainty Uc(y) from the Welch-Satterthwaite equation</p>
<p>(7)</p>
<p>where  we can take the proper coverage factor k from Table E.1 of the EA-4/02 Expression of the Uncertainty of Measurements in Calibrations.</p>
<p>In our case all the uncertainties estimated as Type B have infinite degrees of freedom. The type A uncertainties have n-1 degrees of freedom where n the number of measurements.</p>
<p>Veff =</p>
<p>(8)</p>
<p>6.8.5  Deviation of Indications</p>
<p>The deviation δI of the indication Ι, of the under calibration thermometer from the reference indication Εref, is estimated by:</p>
<p>δI = Ι – Eref + ΣδΤi</p>
<p>(9)</p>
<p>where ΣδΤi is the sum of all the correction factors.</p>
<p>6.8.6  Best Measurement Capability</p>
<p>The best measurement capability of the lab is deduced from the lowest uncertainty of the temperature measurement that the lab can achieve in every day operation. It depends on the uncertainty contributions of the standard thermometers, the calibration procedure and the environmental conditions (the contribution of the thermometer under test is not taken into account). The best measurement capability has been evaluated in the excel file.</p>

<p>7.1  Thermocouple Thermometer</p>
<p>Thermocouple Thermometers are the most widely used of all temperature sensors. Their basic simplicity and reliability have an obvious appeal for many industrial applications. However, when accuracies greater than normal industrial requirements are called for, their simplicity in use is lost and their reliability cannot be assumed.</p>
<p>For example, a major manufacturer of Type K thermocouple wire advises: ‘Once a thermocouple has been used at a high temperature, it is not good practice to use it later at a lower temperature’. Yet commercial hand-held electronic thermometers using Type K thermocouple thermometers are sold for use over the range -200 °C to 1400 °C and at an accuracy far exceeding that claimed by the wire manufacturer!</p>
<p>Such misuse of thermocouple thermometers arises in large part from a lack of understanding of how thermocouples work. Thermocouple thermometer literature often mistakenly states that the thermocouple junction is the source of the voltage, whereas in a well-designed measurement the junction does not contribute to the signal at all! Instead, the signal is generated along the length of the thermocouple thermometer wire. This small piece of knowledge tells us that conventional calibration techniques applied to thermocouple thermometers are often futile, and has a profound effect on the way traceability must be established.</p>
<p>William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) outlined the principles of thermocouple thermometer in the 1850s. He explained the relationship between the thermoelectric effects discovered by See beck in 1821 and Pettier in 1834, and predicted and verified the effect now known as the Thomson effect. Unfortunately, in most manufacturers’ literature and texts this understanding has been replaced by three empirical observations that have come to be known as the ‘Three Laws of Thermoelectricity’. These laws have the appeal of simplicity but give a working model that completely obscures the physical source of the thermoelectric potential. The model is both unhelpful and misleading for anyone analyzing thermocouples or trying to avoid the common errors in thermocouple practice. Periodically the basic principles are rediscovered, most often when large errors result from the use of thermocouple thermometers in new and unusual applications, or when some large industry loses millions of dollars because of the misunderstanding.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the construction of thermocouple thermometer, the errors that occurring use, and calibration methods for thermocouple thermometers that do work in practice. Before we do, however, we shall spend some time developing a clear description (hopefully) of the operating principles of thermocouple thermometers.</p>
<p>7.2  Construction of Thermocouple Thermometer</p>
<p>There is no standard way to construct a thermocouple thermometer, as they have been adapted to a wide variety of situations. Where possible a thermocouple assembly should be obtained from a well-known supplier because specialized materials and techniques can be involved for some applications. The main steps involved in construction are covered here primarily to help the user specify the thermocouple thermometer when purchasing. They will also provide general guidance for the construction of thermocouple thermometers.</p>
<p>7.2.1  Junctions</p>
<p>The sole purpose of a thermocouple thermometer junction is to provide electrical continuity. Whereas twisting and soft solder may well be suitable at low temperatures, for reliable high temperature exposure the junction should be welded.</p>
<p>7.2.2  Sheaths and Thermo Wells</p>
<p>While completely bare wire is sometimes used, especially in applications requiring the heavier gauges, it is more common to cover the wire to provide electrical insulation and environmental protection. A wide variety of insulating materials are available to suit many purposes and the user is advised to consult a catalogue to select an appropriate covering material. For higher temperatures, thermocouple thermometers are commonly hand assembled from bare wire and ceramic beads. Cleanliness is essential for this operation. Avoid work hardening the wire during handling. Bare junctions can be used to achieve a low mass or small size. If there is a risk of contamination the wire may need to be replaced frequently or if an increase in size and mass can be tolerated, a sheath can be used to provide protection.</p>
<p>7.2.3  Mineral-Insulated Metal Sheaths</p>
<p>MIMS (Mineral-Insulated, Metal-Sheathed) thermocouple thermometers are a very convenient form of thermocouple thermometer cable (See Figure 7.4). They offer the same protection as a metal</p>
<p>sheath while retaining a reasonable amount of flexibility. Various sizes from 0.25mm to 6mm diameter are often available from stock with special diameters up to 24mm made to order. The smaller diameters make it possible to preserve the size and mass advantage of thermocouples in a protective sheath.</p>
<p>7.2.4  The Paltrier Effect</p>
<p>Figure: 7.5 shows a simple thermocouple thermometer circuit made from two dissimilar wires, all at the same temperature. Now consider what happens when an electric current flows around the circuit. At one junction (in this case, the left-hand junction), the electrons move from a metal where they carry a lot of chemical potential energy to one where they carry less (at the same temperature). So the electrons carry that energy across the junction and then must come to thermal equilibrium with the different metal. In doing so they give some of their spare energy to the lattice and we see this as heat.</p>
<p>Figure 7.5 : The Pettier effect. Electrons moving from one conductor to another change state and may take in heat or release heat. The effect is reversible; changing the direction of the current moves heat in the other direction</p>
<p>7.2.5  The See beck Effect</p>
<p>Figure: 7.6 shows a single conductor exposed to a temperature gradient, but with no current flowing. The electrons within the conductor behave much like a gas. At the hot end of the conductor, the electrons have a high kinetic energy so move around violently and diffuse towards the cold end of the conductor. Similarly cold electrons</p>
<p>Figure 7.6 : The Thomson effect. Electrons moving from cold parts of a conductor into hotter parts take up heat and cool the conductor. The effect is reversible; heat is released as electrons move from hotter parts to cooler parts</p>
<p>Figure 7.7 : The See beck effect. The electrons in a conductor behave like a gas and expand under the influence of temperature. We observe the redistribution of electrons as a change in voltage along the length of the conductor. This occurs only where there is heat flowing; that is, only where there is a temperature gradient diffuse towards the hot end, but not so vigorously. The hot electrons carry heat to the cool parts of the conductor, while cool electrons take up heat from the hot parts of the conductor. The diffusion of free electrons is the main reason that metals have a high thermal conductivity.</p>
<p>In the same way, the change in See beck voltage, Es, occurs only where there is a temperature gradient and in proportion to the temperature gradient:</p>
<p>dEs = s(T )dT,</p>
<p>Figure 7.8 : The siphon analogy of the See beck effect. The change in pressure in the fluid-filled hose occurs only where there is a gradient.</p>
<p>Figure 7.9 : A defect (bubble) that occurs at a gradient has an effect on the pressure in the siphon, whereas a defect in an area where there is no gradient has no effect.</p>
<p>where s(T ) is called the See beck coefficient of the conductor, and dEs and dT are small changes in See beck voltage and temperature respectively. The See beck coefficient depends on the electronic properties of the conductor so is different for every metal and alloy, and varies with defect or contaminant concentration.</p>
<p>7.3  Errors in Thermocouple Thermometer</p>
<p>Reconsider Figure 7.10, which shows a measurement model for a thermocouple thermometer. Unlike other temperature sensors, the active part of the thermocouple thermometer is distributed over a long length and is thus exposed to a wide variation in environmental conditions, making an error assessment very difficult. Figure 20 summarizes the various error effects that must be considered.</p>
<p>Figure 7.10 : A summary of the sources of error in a thermocouple thermometer temperature measurement.</p>
<p>There are 8 (eight) types of errors in Thermocouple Thermometer</p>
<ul>
<li>Thermal Effects.</li>
<li>Inhomogeneity Errors.</li>
<li>Heat Treatment.</li>
<li>Isothermal Errors.</li>
<li>Reference Junction Errors.</li>
<li>Interference Errors.</li>
<li>Wire Resistance Errors.</li>
<li>Linearization Errors.</li>

<p>Calibration of electronic balance has been performed with reference weight F1. At the time of calibration temperature was 260C, relative humidity (RH) was 70%, air pressure was 1012 mbar. The capacity of the balance was 600g. Off-center loading/eccentricity test, indication test/linearity test, repeatability test were done very carefully. Calculation of uncertainty was satisfactory, because it was within the limit.</p>
<p>Standard platinum resistance thermometer (SPRT) and thermocouple thermometer calibration were done in Temperature Measurement Laboratory of National Metrology Laboratory (NML), BSTI. The calibration were performed in ambient conditions under normal atmospheric pressure, temperature of 23°C ± 5°C and a relative humidity (RH) of 50% ± 20%. At the time of calibration of SPRT, it was seen that the resistance ideally varies linearly with temperature. SPRT can be used up to 6600C, but the measurement was taken from 00C to 500C. The results of SPRT calibration was good, because it was within the standard limit.</p>
<p>Thermocouple Thermometer calibration was done using an ice bath. The thermocouple thermometer calibration can be done in the temperature range from 2000C to 26000C. But this calibration was done in the temperature range from 00C to 10000C. The results of calibration were found within the standard limit.</p>
<p>The reported calibration work involves a very little money and it is very accurate, reliable and precise. Electronic balance is suitable for accurate weighing, time saving and also easy to use.</p>
<p>Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI) spends huge foreign exchange for calibration of its procured National Metrology Laboratory (NML) equipment from abroad which is not desirable to us. So, BSTI should purchase National and Primary  Standards used in the measurement system for calibration of NML equipment.</p>
<p>BSTI should continue calibration services of weights, measures, weighing and measuring instruments used in laboratory, academia, industries, wholesale and retail traders etc. to establish standard measurement system in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>9.1  Conclusion</p>
<p>Calibration of Electronic Balance, Standard Platinum Resistance Thermometer (SPRT) and Thermocouple Thermometer ensure accurate, reliable and precession measurement in the Research Laboratories, Academic Institutions and  Industrial Sectors.</p>
<p>National Metrology Laboratory (NML) of Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI) has established chain of traceability in the measurement system in Bangladesh as well as other NML’s of the world.</p>
<p>9.2  Recommendations</p>
<p>Bangladesh Standards and Institution (BSTI) should continue Standard Calibration for all the equipment used in National etrology Laboratory (NML) by procuring Primary and National Standards used in the Measurement System.</p>
<p>Bangladesh Accreditation Board (BAB) should be strengthened within shortest possible time, so that it can start accreditation activities for all organizations, bodies, systems, individuals of our country as per ISO 17025.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>SCAN </b>realizes that <b>organizations</b> are gradually outsourcing more and more of their recruitments because they find it more cost effective to give the total recruitment assignment (e.g. Job designing, advertisement, application receiving, short-listing, and communication, Test or Interview etc.) to a third party. <b>SCAN</b> is qualified in conducting these functions as a specialty skill.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>BACKGROUND: </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Women play a key role for the development of the society and the family. No country or society can achieve its potential without adequately investing in developing the capabilities of women and encouraging the empowerment of women. In most developing countries, women have much less access to education, jobs, income and power than men. Women are discriminated against in many spheres.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Human resource development involves women. It is appeared that when the capabilities of women be improved and all disadvantages and discrimination be removed and then women have the opportunity to become active participants in all aspects of society. Empowering women is a key element in the success of any Human Resource Development Program.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In March, 1997, the BD government declared the National Policy for the development of women. The objective of the National Policy is to develop women as a human resource and establish women’s human rights, eliminate all forms of discrimination against women and girls and to recognize women’s contribution in the social economic spheres. Gender discrimination is very common in most organizations in our country. Due to this discrimination women are not in top position in job sector in many cases, men are getting most of the priority.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In 2007, even after 10 years of the existence of this national policy, we are yet to see the great improvements in term of achieving, equality and equity for women and assurance of all their human rights.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It is assumed that women are differentiated in terms of organizational experience; job performance evaluations and career outcomes etc. Most women work, in clerical jobs and few enter middle-or- top- management position.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Objectives:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Broad objectives:</b></p>

<p><strong>stock exchange</strong>, <strong>securities exchange</strong> or bourse is a facility where stock brokers and traders can buy and sell securities, such as shares of stock and bonds and other financial instruments. Stock exchanges may also provide facilities for the issue and redemption of such securities and instruments and capital events including the payment of income and dividends.Securities traded on a stock exchange include stock issued by listed companies, unit trusts, derivatives, pooled investment products and bonds. Stock exchanges often function as “continuous auction” markets with buyers and sellers consummating transactions at a central location such as the floor of the exchange. Many stock exchanges today use electronic trading, in place of the traditional floor trading.</p>
<p>To be able to trade a security on a certain stock exchange, the security must be listed there. Usually, there is a central location at least for record keeping, but trade is increasingly less linked to a physical place, as modern markets use electronic networks, which give them advantages of increased speed and reduced cost of transactions. Trade on an exchange is restricted to brokers who are members of the exchange. In recent years, various other trading venues, such as electronic communication networks, alternative trading systems and “dark pools” have taken much of the trading activity away from traditional stock exchanges.</p>
<p>Initial public offerings of stocks and bonds to investors is done in the primary market and subsequent trading is done in the secondary market. A stock exchange is often the most important component of a stock market. Supply and demand in stock markets are driven by various factors that, as in all free markets, affect the price of stocks (see stock valuation).</p>
<p>There is usually no obligation for stock to be issued through the stock exchange itself, nor must stock be subsequently traded on an exchange. Such trading may be <em>off exchange</em> or over-the-counter. This is the usual way that derivatives and bonds are traded. Increasingly, stock exchanges are part of a global securities market. Stock exchanges also serve an economic function in providing liquidity to shareholders in providing an efficient means of disposing of shares.</p>

<p><strong>1.1 A Brief History of Measurement System</strong></p>
<p>Weights and measures are among the earliest tools invented by man. Man understandably turned first to parts of his body and his natural surroundings measuring instruments. Early Babylonian and Egyptian records, and the Bible, indicate that length was first measured with the forearm, hand, or finger and time was measured by the periods of the sun, moon, and other heavenly bodies.</p>
<p>The ancient English system “<strong>digit</strong>“, “<strong>palm</strong>“, “<strong>span</strong>” and “<strong>cubic</strong>” units of length slowly lost preference to the length units “<strong>inch</strong>“, “<strong>foot</strong>” and “<strong>yard</strong>“.</p>
<p>Roman contributions include the use of 12 as a base number (the foot is divided into 12 inches) and the words from which we derive many of our present measurement unit names. For example, the 12 divisions of the Roman “<strong>pes</strong>” or foot were called unciae. Our words “<strong>inch</strong>” and “<strong>ounce</strong>” are both derived from that Latin word.</p>
<p>The “<strong>yard</strong>” as a measure of length can be traced back to early Saxon kings. They wore a sash or girdle around the waist that could be removed and used as a convenient measuring device. The word “<strong>yard</strong>” comes from the Saxon word “<strong>gird</strong>” meaning the circumference of a person’s waist.</p>
<p>Tradition holds that King Henry I decreed that a yard should be the distance from the tip of his nose to the end of his outstretched thumb. The length of a furlong (or furrow-long) was established by early Tudor rulers as 220 yards. This led Queen Elizabeth I to declare in the 16th century, that henceforth the traditional Roman mile of 5000 feet would be replaced by one of 5280 feet, making the mile exactly eight furlongs and providing a convenient relationship between the furlong and the mile.<br/>
The need for a single worldwide coordinated measurement system was recognized over 300 years ago.</p>
<p>In 1790, the Commission appointed by the French Academy created a system that was, at once, simple and scientific. The unit of length was to be a portion of the Earth’s circumference. Measures for capacity (volume) and mass were to be derived from the unit of length, thus relating the basic units of the system to each other and to nature. Furthermore, larger and smaller multiples of each unit were to be created by multiplying or dividing the basic units by 10 and its powers. This feature provided a great convenience to users of the system, by eliminating the need for such calculations as dividing by 16 (to convert ounces to pounds) or by 12 (to convert inches to feet). Similar calculations in the metric system could be performed simply by shifting the decimal point Thus, the metric system is a “base-10” or “decimal” system.</p>
<p>The initial metric unit of mass, the “gram,” was defined as the mass of one cubic centimeter (a cube that is 0.01 meter on each side) of water at its temperature of maximum density. The cubic decimeter (a cube 0. 1 meter on each side) was chosen as the unit for capacity. The fluid volume measurement for the cubic decimeter was given the name “liter.”</p>
<p>By 1900 a total of 35 nations – including the major nations of continental Europe and most of South America – had officially accepted the metric system.</p>
<p>In 1960, the General Conference on Weights and Measures, the diplomatic organization made up of the signatory nations to the Meter Convention, adopted an extensive revision and simplification of the system. Seven units — the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), the ampere (for electric current), the Kelvin (for thermodynamic temperature), the mole (for amount of substance), and the candela (for luminous intensity) were established as the base units for the system. The name System International d’unites (International System of Units), with the international abbreviation SI, was adopted for this modern metric system.</p>
<p>The Bangladesh Government has promulgated an ordinance named “The Standards of Weights and Measures Ordinance, 1982” (Ordinance No. XII of 1982) and under this Ordinance a rules named “The Bangladesh Standards of Weights and Measures Rules, 1982” and empowered the authority to Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI) to introduction and implementation of Metric System in Bangladesh.</p>

<p><strong>2.7 Important Definitions Related to Measurement System  </strong></p>
<p><strong>2.7.1 Verification</strong></p>
<p>Verification, with its grammatical variations and cognate expressions, includes, in relation to any weight or measure, the process of comparing, checking, testing or adjusting such weight or measure with a view to ensuring that such weight or measure conforms to the standards established by or under this Ordinance and also includes, re-verification and calibration.</p>
<p><strong>2.7.2 </strong><strong>Calibration</strong></p>
<p>The set of operations that establish, under specific conditions, the relationship between values for quantities indicated by a measuring instrument or measuring system, or values represented by a material measure or a reference material, and corresponding values realized by a standards.</p>
<p><strong>2.7.3 Acclimatization</strong></p>
<p>Acclimatization or acclimation is the process of an individual organism adjusting to a gradual change in its environment, (such as a change in temperature, humidity, photoperiod, or pH) allowing it to maintain performance across a range of environmental conditions</p>
<p><strong>2.7.4 </strong><strong>Accuracy and Precision</strong></p>
<p>In the fields of science, engineering, industry and statistics, the <strong>accuracy</strong> of a measurement system is the degree of closeness of measurements of a quantity to that quantity’s actual (true) value. The precision of a measurement system, also called reproducibility or repeatability, is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions show the same results.</p>
<p><strong>2.8 Uncertainty</strong></p>
<p>Parameter associated with the result of a measurement, that characterizes the dispersion of the values that could reasonably be attributed to the measured.</p>
<p><strong>2.8.1 Measurement Uncertainties</strong></p>
<p>Measurement uncertainties are caused by a number of  factors influencing  a measurement process.</p>

BSTI-NML is a full member of Asia Pacific Metrology Programmed (APMP), corresponding member of OIML (International Organization of Legal Metrology), associate member of BIPM (International Bureau of Weights and Measures) BSTI also member of International Organization for Standardization (ISO), International Electro-technical Committee (IEC), CODEX, SARSO. BSTI has also signed CIPM-MRA.</p>
<p>The BSTl-NML also maintains sound cooperative relations with NMLs worldwide. Bilateral cooperation activities such as the technical and personnel exchange are prosperous.</p>
<p><strong>2.9.1 <strong>Asia Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP)</strong></strong></p>
<p>In 1980, Asia Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP) was established to improve the level of measurement standards in the Asia Pacific region. In the early 80s, APMP mainly focused on supporting developing economies. From the 90s, APMP has the nature of a regional organization with a view to establish the international equivalence in measurement standards.<br/>
In November 1999, Japan assumed the Chairpersonship of APMP, and the Secretariat was also set up in NRLM (NMIJ from 2001) to provide with various useful information to the member economies and other international organizations. APMP is playing a major role as one of the largest regional metrology organizations in the world. In October 2004, the Chairpersonship was transferred to New Zealand.</p>
<p><strong>2.9.1.1 Full Members of APMP</strong><br/>
23 countries are the full member of APMP. In favour of Bangladesh, BSTI became full member of APMP in 1977.<br/>

The International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML) is an intergovernmental treaty organization whose membership includes Member States, countries which participate actively in technical activities, and Corresponding Members, countries which join the OIML as observers. It was established in 1955 (see the Convention) in order to promote the global harmonization of legal metrology procedures. Since that time, the OIML has developed a worldwide technical structure that provides its Members with metrological guidelines for the elaboration of national and regional requirements concerning the manufacture and use of measuring instruments for legal metrology applications.<br/>
According to 2007 World Bank figures, OIML Members cover in total an astounding 86 % of the world’s population and 96 % of its economy.<br/>
<strong>2.9.3 General Conference on Weights and Measures</strong></p>
<p>The General Conference on Weights and Measures is made up of delegates of the governments of the <a href=""http://www.bipm.org/en/convention/member_states/"">Member States</a> and observers from the <a href=""http://www.bipm.org/en/convention/member_states/#associates"">Associates</a> of the CGPM.<br/>
The General Conference receives the report of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (<a href=""http://www.bipm.org/en/committees/cipm/"">CIPM</a>) on work accomplished; it discusses and examines the arrangements required to ensure the propagation and improvement of the International System of Units (<a href=""http://www.bipm.org/en/si/"">SI</a>); it endorses the results of new fundamental metrological determinations and various scientific resolutions of international scope; and it decides all major issues concerning the organization and development of the <a href=""http://www.bipm.org/en/bipm/"">BIPM</a>, including the donation of the BIPM for the next four-year period.<br/>
The CGPM currently meets in Paris once every four years; the <a href=""http://www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ListCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM=23"">23rd meeting</a> of the CGPM was held in November 2007, and the 24th will be held in 2011.</p>
<p><strong>2.9.4 The International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM)</strong><br/>
The BIPM was created on 20 May 1875, following the signing of the Metre Convention, a treaty among 51 nations (as of August 2008<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures&amp;action=edit""><sup>[update]</sup></a>). It is based at the Pavilion de Britoil in Sevres, France, granted to the Bureau in 1876.<br/>
The <strong>International Bureau of Weights and Measures</strong> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language"" title=""French language"">French</a>: Bureau international des poids et mesures), is an international <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standards_organization"" title=""Standards organization"">standards organization</a>, one of three such organizations established to maintain the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units"" title=""International System of Units"">International System of Units</a> (SI) under the terms of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_Convention"" title=""Metre Convention"">Metre Convention</a> (Convention due Metre). The organization is usually referred to by its French <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym_and_initialism"" title=""Acronym and initialism"">initialize</a>, BIPM.<br/>
The other organizations that maintain the SI system, also known by their French initializes are the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures"" title=""General Conference on Weights and Measures"">General Conference on Weights and Measures</a> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language"" title=""French language"">French</a>: Conférence générale des poids et mesures) (CGPM) and the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_for_Weights_and_Measures"" title=""International Committee for Weights and Measures"">International Committee for Weights and Measures</a> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language"" title=""French language"">French</a>: Comité international des poids et mesures) (CIPM).<br/>
<strong>2.9.4.1 Member States and Associates</strong><br/>
As of 24 May 2011, there are 55 member states of the BIPM, and 33 associate states and economies of the General Conference. Bangladesh is the associate member of BIPM.<br/>
<strong>2.9.5 </strong><strong>International Organization for Standardization (ISO)</strong></p>
<p>ISO is the world’s largest developer and publisher of International Standards.</p>
<p>ISO is a network of the national standards institutes of 162 countries, one member per country, with a Central Secretariat in Geneva, Switzerland, that coordinates the system.</p>
<p>ISO is a non-governmental organization that forms a bridge between the public and private sectors. On the one hand, many of its member institutes are part of the governmental structure of their countries, or are mandated by their government. On the other hand, other members have their roots uniquely in the private sector, having been set up by national partnerships of industry associations.</p>
<p>Therefore, ISO enables a consensus to be reached on solutions that meet both the requirements of business and the broader needs of society. ISO is responsible for formulation of International Standards of different products, raw materials, services etc.</p>
<p>There are 162 members which are divided into three categories:

<p><strong>3.2 </strong><strong>Asia Pacific Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (APLAC)</strong></p>
<p>APLAC is a cooperation of accreditation bodies in the Asia Pacific region that accredit laboratories, inspection bodies and reference material producers.  It is recognized by the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) as one of five Specialist Regional Bodies (SRBs).</p>
<p><strong>3.2.1 International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC</strong>)<br/>
ILAC is an international cooperation of laboratory and inspection accreditation bodies formed more than 30 years ago to help remove technical barriers to trade.<br/>
Accreditation bodies around the world, which have been evaluated by peers as competent, have signed an arrangement that enhances the acceptance of products and services across national borders. The purpose of this arrangement, the ILAC Arrangement, is to create an international framework to support international trade through the removal of technical barriers.<br/>
ILAC counts as its members laboratory and inspection accreditation bodies representing more than 70 economies and regional organizations.<br/>
The ultimate aim of the ILAC Arrangement is the increased use and acceptance by industry as well as regulators of the results from accredited laboratories and inspection bodies, including results from laboratories in other countries. In this way, the free-trade goal of  ‘product tested once and accepted everywhere’ can be realized.</p>

<strong>4.3 Base Units of System International (SI)</strong></p></div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>4.3.1 SI Base Units</strong></p>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">The International System of Units (SI) defines seven units of measure as a basic set from which all other SI units are derived. These SI base units and their physical quantities are:</div>
<ol>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">meter for length</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">kilogram for mass</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">second for time</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">ampere for electric current</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Kelvin for temperature</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">candela for luminous intensity</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">mole for the amount of substance<strong>.</strong></li>
</ol>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">The SI base quantities form a set of mutually independent dimensions as required by dimensional analysis commonly employed in science and technology.  However, in a given realization of these units they may well be interdependent, i.e. defined in terms of each other:<br/>
The names of all SI units are written in lowercase characters (e.g., the <em>meter</em> has the symbol m), except that the symbols of units named after persons are written with an initial capital letter (e.g., the <em>ampere</em> has the uppercase symbol A).</div>

<p><strong>CALIBRATION PROCEDURE OF ELECTRONIC BALANCE</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.1 Electronic Balance </strong></p>
<p>The modern electronic balance is a deceptively simple device. To use it well and get good results, we must understand how it works, and what precautions we must take when handling samples to get the precision we need for good laboratory practice.</p>
<p>When we press Tare, the balance readout is simply set to zero. When we use Calibrate, a known weight is internally placed on the balance, and the electronics are recalibrated to provide the exact magnetic current to the electromagnet to balance the weight as displayed.<br/>

<p><strong>Figure 5.1:</strong> Schematic Diagram of Electronic Balance</p>
<p><strong>5.2 </strong><strong>Working Standards</strong></p>
<p>A weight is a piece of material, usually metal, of known mass and usually of known uncertainty. The OIML definition of a weigh is ‘‘A material measure of mass, regulated in regard to its physical and metrological characteristics: shape, dimensions, material, surface quality, nominal value and maximum permissible error’’.</p>
<p>According to the <em>OIML R111</em> publication, there are seven classes of weights (Classes: E<sub>1</sub>, E<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub> and M<sub>3</sub>) in tiers of uncertainty, with E<sub>1</sub> as the highest class. The uncertainty of calibration and change in mass are assigned to each class and are included in the uncertainty budget of the task. A summary chart appears in the following table:</p>

<p>The environmental conditions (air currents, vibrations, stability of the weighing site) shall be suitable for the instrument to be calibrated. In particular, operational disturbances due to contamination or damage must be avoided. The weight values must be unequivocally indicated and indications, where given, shall be easily readable.</p>
<p>The user of the instrument shall be asked to ensure that the customary working conditions prevail during the calibration. In this way the interference effects of air currents, vibrations and inclination of the measuring platform will be inherent to the measured values and will therefore be incorporated in the determined uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>5.4 Preparation for the Calibration of the Weighing Instrument</strong></p>
<p>All details of the operation manual regarding the setting up, the environmental conditions, the technical specifications (Max, d, linearity and temperature coefficient), as well as the adjustment and calibration process should be taken into account.</p>
<p>The most important thing for the reliable operation of a weighing instrument is a location free from vibrations and draughts. If the required conditions are not fulfilled, the calibration process must not be carried out. Before the calibration of the weighing instrument, the following preliminary checks should be realized:</p>

<p><strong>CALIBRATION OF STANDARD PLATINUM RESISTANCE THERMOMETER</strong></p>
<p><strong>6.1 Thermometer</strong><br/>
Thermometers measure temperature, by using materials that change in some way when they are heated or cooled. Modern thermometers are calibrated in standard temperature units such as Fahrenheit or Celsius and Kelvin.</p>
<p><img src=""file:///C:/Users/Papon/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image027.jpg"" style=""height: 370px; width: 432px;""/></p>
<p><strong>Figure 6.1:</strong> Different Temperature Scale</p>
<p><strong>6.2 Resistance Thermometer</strong><br/>
Resistance thermometers are usually made using platinum, because of its linear resistance-temperature relationship and its chemical inertness. The platinum detecting wire needs to be kept free of contamination to remain stable. A platinum wire or film is supported on a former in such a way that it gets minimal differential expansion or other strains from its former, yet is reasonably resistant to vibration. RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector) assemblies made from iron or copper are also used in some applications.<br/>
Commercial platinum grades are produced which exhibit a temperature coefficient of resistance 0.00385/°C (0.385%/°C) The sensor is usually made to have a resistance of 100 Ω at 0 °C. This is defined in BS EN 60751:1996 (taken from IEC 60751:1995). The American Fundamental Interval is 0.00392/°C, based on using a purer grade of platinum than the European standard. The American standard is from the Scientific Apparatus Manufacturers Association (SAMA), who are no longer in this standards field. As a result the “American standard” is hardly the standard even in the US.</p>
<p>Measurement of resistance requires a small current to be passed through the device under test. This can cause resistive heating, causing significant loss of accuracy if manufacturers’ limits are not respected, or the design does not properly consider the heat path. Mechanical strain on the resistance thermometer can also cause inaccuracy. Lead wire resistance can also be a factor; adopting three- and four-wire, instead of two-wire, connections can eliminate connection lead resistance effects from measurements  three-wire connection is sufficient for most purposes and almost universal industrial practice. Four-wire connections are used for the most precise applications.</p>
<p><strong>6.3 Standard Platinum Resistance Thermometer (SPRT)</strong><br/>
SPRT consists of spectrally pure platinum wire which is wound free from mechanical stresses. Resistance thermometers use electrical resistance and require a power source to operate. The resistance ideally varies linearly with temperature. This thermometer can be used up to 660<sup>0</sup> C. RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector) assemblies made from iron or copper are also used in some applications. SPRT ensures high accuracy, low drift and wide operating range and it is suitable for precession applications.<br/>

<p><strong>Figure 6.2:</strong> Standards Platinum Resistance Thermometer</p>
<p><strong>6.4 Environmental Conditions</strong><br/>
Calibration can be carried out in laboratory. The calibration performed in ambient conditions under normal atmospheric pressure, temperature 23°C ± 5°C and a relative humidity 50% ± 20%.</p>
<p><strong>6.5 Preparation for the Calibration of Thermometers</strong><br/>
Calibration of the thermometer is performed before any adjustments take place. The calibrator is operated in the vertical position.</p>
<p>All measurements are to be carried out with the top of the block or bath exposed or insulated, as recommended by the manufacturer and described in the calibration certificate of the temperature block or bath calibrator.</p>
<p>All measurements are to be carried out in such a way that the standard and test thermometers sensors are placed in the homogeneous zone of the temperature calibrator.</p>
<p><strong>6.5.1 Visual Check</strong><br/>
Visually examine the thermometers of obvious defects that would affect the accuracy. Furthermore, if the thermometer consists of thermocouples or other probes as sensors look for obvious signs of mechanical defects, contamination, etc. which shall be recorded and the client informed if the laboratory feels that the validity or uncertainty of measurement in the calibration could be impaired.<br/>
<strong>6.5.2 </strong><strong>Initial Zero Point Check</strong><br/>
Before the placement of the thermometer under calibration in the temperature bath zero point is checked in the ice bath.</p>
<p>The low uncertainty of the reference standard thermometers requires a carefully prepared ice bath to maintain the temperature of the reference probe at 0 °C. A properly prepared ice bath will have an expanded uncertainty of 2 mK.</p>
<p>The ice for the ice bath should be finely-crushed or shaved ice that has been prepared from distilled water. The ice should be saturated with distilled water, and then packed gently into an insulating Dewar flask, such that ice fully fills the volume of the flask with no large voids. A cylindrical flask (7 cm inner diameter and 30 cm deep) having a polyethylene-foam cover, 2.5 cm thick, is used. Other flask geometries are allowable, provided the flask is at least 6 cm inner diameter and 30 cm deep, and the thickness of the cover is in the range 1.5 cm to 3 cm. The level of the ice-water mixture should be within 5 mm of the bottom surface of the cover. The cover should have a hole of adequate diameter in the center, to allow insertion of the temperature probe into the ice point. The probe should be inserted until the stop on the probe is butted against the flask cover. Since the ice in the Dewar flask will tend to float as the ice melts, a rubber band should be used to secure the cover onto the flask.</p>
<p>The use of electronic ice-point compensators, extension wires, and automated ice points cooled with thermoelectric modules is not recommended unless a careful analysis of the additional uncertainties is performed. These devices, in general, contribute additional errors to the measurements.</p>
<p>When it is possible use a Triple Point of Water (TPW) cell to maintain the reference thermometer at a temperature of 0.01 °C.</p>
<p><strong>6.6 </strong><strong>Calibration Procedure of Standard Platinum Resistance Thermometer</strong></p>
<p>The calibration of the thermometer is achieved by comparison against a standard thermometer when both are placed in a temperature calibrator. Both the standard thermometer and the test thermometer are maintained in an isothermal region so comparisons can be possible.</p>
<p>The temperature calibrator shall have a zone of sufficient temperature homogeneity (referred to as measurement zone). The homogeneous zone will in general be at the lower end of the boring or bath. If the homogeneous zone is situated at another place, this is explicitly stated in the calibration certificate of the temperature calibrator.</p>
<p>Thermometers are calibrated by comparison with standard thermometer, in thermally stabilized temperature calibrators suitable for the calibration by comparison techniques. The standard thermometer and the temperature calibrator shall be traceable to national standards.</p>
<p><strong>6.6.1 </strong><strong>Immersion of Thermometers in the Temperature Bath</strong><br/>
Immersion of the standard Pt 100 and the thermometer under calibration in the temperature bath is realized as follows:</p></div>
<ol>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">The bath is powered ON.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">The reference Pt 100 is sunk inside the bath and it is stabilized via stanchion. The immersion depth is the largest possible and it is placed near the side from where the operator takes the measurements.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">The under calibration thermometer is also sunk inside the bath and is stabilized via stanchion.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">The two sensors are placed the nearest possible to one each other. The maximum number of thermometers that can be calibrated simultaneously is three (for liquid in glass the maximum number is two).</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">The reference sensor is suitably connected with its digital indicator for the running temperature to be recorded.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">The two sensors remain immersed for all the duration of measurement.</li>
</ol>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<strong>6.6.2 </strong><strong>Measuring Points</strong>
</div>
<ol>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">The bath is set at the proper temperatures placing its set point at the corresponding values.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">The number of temperature points (from 3 to 5) are selected in such a way for to correspond in roughly equal intervals in the measuring range.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">In each reference temperature and after the stabilization of the bath, we wait 15 more minutes  in order thermal balance to be restored.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Under stabilization conditions the measurements of temperature from the reference thermometer are recorded (A circle: 10 values with minimum time interval between them 5 sec).</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">The measurements of temperature from the thermometer under calibration are recorded (B circle: 10 values with minimum time interval between them 5 sec).</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">The measurements of temperature from the reference thermometer are repeated again and recorded (A circle: 10 values with minimum time interval between them 5 sec).</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">The mean values of the two measuring cycles from the reference thermometer must not be different more than two times the bath stability (0.02 <sup>0</sup>C).</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Calibration of the thermometer at other measuring points is realized with the same methodology in increasing only sequence.</li>
</ol>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<strong>6.6.3 Final</strong><strong> Zero Point Check</strong>
<p>After the check of the thermometer in the measuring points check in zero point is repeated as follows:</p></div>
<ol>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Afterwards the end of calibration the reference sensory and the thermometer under calibration are maintained at environmental temperature until thermal balance.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">The two thermometers are cleaned with distilled or de ionized water.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">The two sensors are immersed in the ice bath in the Dewar vessel.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Indications are recorded as in the initial control of zero.</li>
</ol>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p><strong>6.7 Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>The values measured in series at increasing temperatures are averaged for each calibration point. The calibration result (deviation of the standard thermometer from the indication of the test thermometer) is documented in the certificate after the necessary corrections.</p>
<p><strong>6.8 Estimation of the Uncertainty of Measurement</strong></p>
<p>The uncertainty to be stated as the uncertainty of the calibration of the thermometer is the measurement uncertainty with which the standard temperature can be stated.</p>
<p>The following contributions to the uncertainty of measurement shall be taken into account.</p>
<p><strong>6.8.1 Reference Temperature</strong></p>
<p>t<sub>i</sub> + δt<sub>i-std-mean</sub> + δt<sub>i-cal </sub>+ δt<sub>i-drift</sub> + δt<sub>i-immersion </sub>+ δt<sub>i-meter-cal</sub> + δt<sub>i-meter-drift</sub> + δt<sub>i-meter-resolution</sub> + δt<sub>bath-homogeneity </sub>+ δt<sub>bath-stability                                                                                                   </sub>                        (1)</p>
<p><strong>t<sub>i</sub></strong>: mean value of the reference temperature (of the 20 measurements with the reference thermometer).<br/>
<strong>δt<sub>i-std-mean</sub></strong>: The standard uncertainty is the standard deviation of the mean value of the 20 measurements with the reference thermometer.<br/>
<strong>δt<sub>i-cal</sub></strong>: correction from the calibration certificate of the reference temperature sensor. The standard uncertainty is the half value of that expanded uncertainty U(k=2) reported in the calibration certificate.<br/>
<strong>δ</strong><strong>t<sub>i-drift</sub></strong>: correction due to the drift of the reference temperature sensor. It is estimated from the calibration history of the sensor. The corresponding standard uncertainty is estimated from rectangular distribution as Δ(t<sub>i+1</sub>-t<sub>i</sub>)/2∙√3.<br/>
<strong>δ</strong><strong>t<sub>i-immersion</sub></strong>: correction due to the inadequate immersion of the reference thermometer sensor (it is estimated via 20mm erases of the sensor from its position and record of the change of the temperature indication Δt: u(δt<sub>i-immersion</sub>)= Δt<sub>imm</sub>/(2∙√3).<br/>
<strong>δ</strong><strong>t<sub>i-meter-cal</sub></strong>: correction due to the calibration of the indicator of the reference sensor.<br/>
<strong>δ</strong><strong>t<sub>i-meter-drift</sub></strong>: correction due to the drift of the indicator of reference temperature.<br/>
<strong>δ</strong><strong>t<sub>i-meter-resolution</sub></strong>: correction due to the resolution of the reference temperature. The estimated correction value is zero with corresponding standard uncertainty d/(2√3).<br/>
<strong>δ</strong><strong>t<sub>bath-homogeneity</sub></strong>: correction due to bath in homogeneity. The estimated correction value is zero with corresponding standard uncertainty Δt<sub>homog</sub>/(2∙√3), where Δt<sub>homog</sub> is the maximum difference of the single values of the temperature indications taken from the reference thermometer at the two positions where the standard sensor and the under calibration thermometer are situated. Alternatively the bath homogeneity can be estimated through the procedure described in WI-T03.<br/>
<strong>δ</strong><strong>t<sub>bath-stability</sub></strong>: correction due to bath instability. The estimated correction value is zero with corresponding standard uncertainty Δt<sub>bath-stability</sub>/(2∙√3), where Δt<sub>bath-stability</sub> is the difference between maximum and minimum temperature indications during 20 min. Alternatively the bath stability can be estimated through the procedure described in WI-T03.</p>
<p>In case where the indicator and sensor have been calibrated as one system the terms δt<sub>i-cal</sub> and δt<sub>i-meter-cal</sub> must be replaced by one term (the same for δt<sub>i-drift</sub> and δt<sub>i-meter-drift</sub>).</p>
<p>The estimated value of most corrections factors is zero with a corresponding however standard uncertainty (with no zero value). The combined uncertainty is estimated via the rule of RSS (Root of Sum of Squares) of all the terms:</p>

<p><img src=""file:///C:/Users/Papon/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image035.gif"" style=""height: 30px; width: 210px;""/>                                                                                (5)</p>
<p><strong>6.8.4 Expanded Uncertainty</strong></p>
<p>The uncertainty of the thermometer is expressed as the expanded uncertainty ± U<sub>exp</sub> which corresponds to a probability of approximately 95 %. This is k times the combined uncertainty, where k is the coverage factor:</p>
<p>U<sub>exp</sub> = k<sup>.</sup>U<sub>comb</sub>                                                                                             (6)</p>
<p>The coverage factor k can be estimated from t- student distribution for specific effective degrees of freedom ν<sub>eff</sub> and confidence level. In case where ν<sub>eff</sub> ≥ 100, then k = 2 can be used.</p>
<p>By estimating the effective degrees of freedom from V<sub>eff</sub> of the combined standard uncertainty U<sub>c</sub>(y) from the Welch-Satterthwaite equation<br/>

<p>where <img src=""file:///C:/Users/Papon/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image038.gif"" style=""height: 24px; width: 77px;""/> we can take the proper coverage factor k from Table E.1 of the EA-4/02 Expression of the Uncertainty of Measurements in Calibrations.<br/>
In our case all the uncertainties estimated as Type B have infinite degrees of freedom. The type A uncertainties have n-1 degrees of freedom where n the number of measurements.</p>

<p><strong>6.8.5 Deviation of Indications</strong></p>
<p>The deviation δI of the indication Ι, of the under calibration thermometer from the reference indication Ε<sub>ref</sub>, is estimated by:</p>
<p>δI = Ι – E<sub>ref</sub> + ΣδΤ<sub>i</sub>                                                                                       (9)</p>
<p>where ΣδΤ<sub>i</sub> is the sum of all the correction factors.</p>
<p><strong>6.8.6 Best Measurement Capability</strong></p>
<p>The best measurement capability of the lab is deduced from the lowest uncertainty of the temperature measurement that the lab can achieve in every day operation. It depends on the uncertainty contributions of the standard thermometers, the calibration procedure and the environmental conditions (the contribution of the thermometer under test is not taken into account). The best measurement capability has been evaluated in the excel file.</p>

<p><strong>CALIBRATION PROCEDURE OF THERMOCOUPLE THERMOMETER</strong></p>
<p><strong>7.1 Thermocouple Thermometer</strong><br/>
Thermocouple Thermometers are the most widely used of all temperature sensors. Their basic simplicity and reliability have an obvious appeal for many industrial applications. However, when accuracies greater than normal industrial requirements are called for, their simplicity in use is lost and their reliability cannot be assumed.</p>
<p>For example, a major manufacturer of Type K thermocouple wire advises: ‘Once a thermocouple has been used at a high temperature, it is not good practice to use it later at a lower temperature’. Yet commercial hand-held electronic thermometers using Type K thermocouple thermometers are sold for use over the range -200 °C to 1400 °C and at an accuracy far exceeding that claimed by the wire manufacturer!</p>
<p>Such misuse of thermocouple thermometers arises in large part from a lack of understanding of how thermocouples work. Thermocouple thermometer literature often mistakenly states that the thermocouple junction is the source of the voltage, whereas in a well-designed measurement the junction does not contribute to the signal at all! Instead, the signal is generated along the length of the thermocouple thermometer wire. This small piece of knowledge tells us that conventional calibration techniques applied to thermocouple thermometers are often futile, and has a profound effect on the way traceability must be established.</p>
<p>William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) outlined the principles of thermocouple thermometer in the 1850s. He explained the relationship between the thermoelectric effects discovered by See beck in 1821 and Pettier in 1834, and predicted and verified the effect now known as the Thomson effect. Unfortunately, in most manufacturers’ literature and texts this understanding has been replaced by three empirical observations that have come to be known as the ‘Three Laws of Thermoelectricity’. These laws have the appeal of simplicity but give a working model that completely obscures the physical source of the thermoelectric potential. The model is both unhelpful and misleading for anyone analyzing thermocouples or trying to avoid the common errors in thermocouple practice. Periodically the basic principles are rediscovered, most often when large errors result from the use of thermocouple thermometers in new and unusual applications, or when some large industry loses millions of dollars because of the misunderstanding.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the construction of thermocouple thermometer, the errors that occurring use, and calibration methods for thermocouple thermometers that do work in practice. Before we do, however, we shall spend some time developing a clear description (hopefully) of the operating principles of thermocouple thermometers.</p>

<p><strong>7.2 Construction of Thermocouple Thermometer</strong></p>
<p>There is no standard way to construct a thermocouple thermometer, as they have been adapted to a wide variety of situations. Where possible a thermocouple assembly should be obtained from a well-known supplier because specialized materials and techniques can be involved for some applications. The main steps involved in construction are covered here primarily to help the user specify the thermocouple thermometer when purchasing. They will also provide general guidance for the construction of thermocouple thermometers.</p>
<p><strong>7.2.1 Junctions</strong></p>
<p>The sole purpose of a thermocouple thermometer junction is to provide electrical continuity. Whereas twisting and soft solder may well be suitable at low temperatures, for reliable high temperature exposure the junction should be welded.</p>
<p><img src=""file:///C:/Users/Papon/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image044.jpg"" style=""height: 236px; width: 384px;""/></p>
<p><strong>Figure 7.2: </strong>Construction of thermocouple thermometer junctions — a representation of a variety of methods that have been found satisfactory</p>
<p><strong>7.2.2 Sheaths and Thermo Wells</strong></p>
<p>While completely bare wire is sometimes used, especially in applications requiring the heavier gauges, it is more common to cover the wire to provide electrical insulation and environmental protection. A wide variety of insulating materials are available to suit many purposes and the user is advised to consult a catalogue to select an appropriate covering material. For higher temperatures, thermocouple thermometers are commonly hand assembled from bare wire and ceramic beads. Cleanliness is essential for this operation. Avoid work hardening the wire during handling. Bare junctions can be used to achieve a low mass or small size. If there is a risk of contamination the wire may need to be replaced frequently or if an increase in size and mass can be tolerated, a sheath can be used to provide protection.</p>

<p><strong>7.2.3 Mineral-Insulated Metal Sheaths</strong><br/>
MIMS (Mineral-Insulated, Metal-Sheathed) thermocouple thermometers are a very convenient form of thermocouple thermometer cable (See Figure 7.4). They offer the same protection as a metal<br/>

<p>sheath while retaining a reasonable amount of flexibility. Various sizes from 0.25mm to 6mm diameter are often available from stock with special diameters up to 24mm made to order. The smaller diameters make it possible to preserve the size and mass advantage of thermocouples in a protective sheath.</p>
<p><strong>7.2.4 The Paltrier Effect</strong></p>
<p>Figure: 7.5 shows a simple thermocouple thermometer circuit made from two dissimilar wires, all at the same temperature. Now consider what happens when an electric current flows around the circuit. At one junction (in this case, the left-hand junction), the electrons move from a metal where they carry a lot of chemical potential energy to one where they carry less (at the same temperature). So the electrons carry that energy across the junction and then must come to thermal equilibrium with the different metal. In doing so they give some of their spare energy to the lattice and we see this as heat.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 7.5: </strong>The Pettier effect. Electrons moving from one conductor to another change state and may take in heat or release heat. The effect is reversible; changing the direction of the current moves heat in the other direction</p>
<p><strong>7.2.5 The See beck Effect</strong></p>
<p><img src=""file:///C:/Users/Papon/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image052.jpg"" style=""height: 199px; width: 465px;""/>Figure: 7.6 shows a single conductor exposed to a temperature gradient, but with no current flowing. The electrons within the conductor behave much like a gas. At the hot end of the conductor, the electrons have a high kinetic energy so move around violently and diffuse towards the cold end of the conductor. Similarly cold electrons</p>
<p><strong>Figure 7.6: </strong>The Thomson effect. Electrons moving from cold parts of a conductor into hotter parts take up heat and cool the conductor. The effect is reversible; heat is released as electrons move from hotter parts to cooler parts<br/>

<p><strong>Figure 7.7: </strong>The See beck effect. The electrons in a conductor behave like a gas and expand under the influence of temperature. We observe the redistribution of electrons as a change in voltage along the length of the conductor. This occurs only where there is heat flowing; that is, only where there is a temperature gradient diffuse towards the hot end, but not so vigorously. The hot electrons carry heat to the cool parts of the conductor, while cool electrons take up heat from the hot parts of the conductor. The diffusion of free electrons is the main reason that metals have a high thermal conductivity.</p>
<p>In the same way, the change in See beck voltage, <em>E</em>s, occurs only where there is a temperature gradient and in proportion to the temperature gradient:</p>
<p>d<em>E</em>s = <em>s(T )</em>d<em>T,</em><br/>

<p><strong>Figure 7.9: </strong>A defect (bubble) that occurs at a gradient has an effect on the pressure in the siphon, whereas a defect in an area where there is no gradient has no effect.<br/>
where <em>s</em>(<em>T </em>) is called the See beck coefficient of the conductor, and d<em>E</em>s and d<em>T </em>are small changes in See beck voltage and temperature respectively. The <em>See beck coefficient</em> depends on the electronic properties of the conductor so is different for every metal and alloy, and varies with defect or contaminant concentration.</p>
<p><strong>7.3 Errors in Thermocouple Thermometer</strong><br/>
Reconsider Figure 7.10, which shows a measurement model for a thermocouple thermometer. Unlike other temperature sensors, the active part of the thermocouple thermometer is distributed over a long length and is thus exposed to a wide variation in environmental conditions, making an error assessment very difficult. Figure 20 summarizes the various error effects that must be considered.</p>

<strong>DISCUSSIONS</strong><br/>
Calibration of electronic balance has been performed with reference weight F<sub>1</sub>. At the time of calibration temperature was 26<sup>0</sup>C, relative humidity (RH) was 70%, air pressure was 1012 mbar. The capacity of the balance was 600g. Off-center loading/eccentricity test, indication test/linearity test, repeatability test were done very carefully. Calculation of uncertainty was satisfactory, because it was within the limit.
<p>Standard platinum resistance thermometer (SPRT) and thermocouple thermometer calibration were done in Temperature Measurement Laboratory of National Metrology Laboratory (NML), BSTI. The calibration were performed in ambient conditions under normal atmospheric pressure, temperature of 23°C ± 5°C and a relative humidity (RH) of 50% ± 20%. At the time of calibration of SPRT, it was seen that the resistance ideally varies linearly with temperature. SPRT can be used up to 660<sup>0</sup>C, but the measurement was taken from 0<sup>0</sup>C to 50<sup>0</sup>C. The results of SPRT calibration was good, because it was within the standard limit.</p>
<p>Thermocouple Thermometer calibration was done using an ice bath. The thermocouple thermometer calibration can be done in the temperature range from 200<sup>0</sup>C to 2600<sup>0</sup>C. But this calibration was done in the temperature range from 0<sup>0</sup>C to 1000<sup>0</sup>C. The results of calibration were found within the standard limit.</p>
<p>The reported calibration work involves a very little money and it is very accurate, reliable and precise. Electronic balance is suitable for accurate weighing, time saving and also easy to use.</p>
<p>Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI) spends huge foreign exchange for calibration of its procured National Metrology Laboratory (NML) equipment from abroad which is not desirable to us. So, BSTI should purchase National and Primary  Standards used in the measurement system for calibration of NML equipment.</p>
<p>BSTI should continue calibration services of weights, measures, weighing and measuring instruments used in laboratory, academia, industries, wholesales and retail traders etc. to establish standard measurement system in Bangladesh.</p>

<div class=""featured-thumb"">
<a href=""#"">

</div>
<div class=""entry-content"">
<p>One definition of social policy is the legal framework from within which society, or in our sphere, medical professionals operate. In the UK social policy mainly consists of Acts of Parliament, although there is also an element of Common Law (laws that are made by the courts) and Ministerial Instruments (Instructions from Ministers that instruct). It is worth noting that all social policy that is passed is within the context of the UK being a ‘western democracy’ and as part of the EU.</p>
<p>The notion of western democracy is important. Parliament does not just pass legislation, it attempts to pass legislation that is either in the short term or long term interests of the electorate, us! We elect and lobby MPs, governments are formed and Bills are introduced and discussed in both Houses. In addition we join pressure groups and professional associations that attempt to exert influence on the legislative process.</p>
<p>One of consequences of legislation is that ‘society’ begins to work on behalf of individuals. John Locke introduced the idea of a Social Contract – the relationship between the state and the individual; the idea that the state should provide a minimum standard of living for the individual. Poor Laws were introduced as far Back as 1536 – an attempt by the state to provide work for the individual. Laissez Faire – the idea that market forces should prevail was being questioned, Charities, the church and philanthropists began to provide for people. Samuel Greg, for example, founded Styal Mill in Cheshire, an industrial work place, but he also took in children and trained them to work in the mill as well as providing quality housing and health care provision for his workers. This approach took a while to bed in bed other captains of industry began to see the advantages of treating their employees with compassion and soon began to lobby government to organise this new interventionist approach to society. In 1870 the Forster Act was passed, this was the turning point – the state took responsibility for education for children between the ages of 5 and 12. Further changes to the education, pensions and benefits systems were introduced over the next 80 years but the main raft of social policies were introduced after WWII.</p>
<p>During WWII William Beveridge conducted an audit into the state of the nation. He toured the country and was astonished with what he found. Britain was not a country fit for heroes. Change was needed. He identified 5 great evils: Want, Ignorance, Squalor, Disease and Idleness. Together these evils prevented Britain realising its potential, they were a cancer evident in the fabric of society. Together they negated any notions of meritocracy.</p>
<p>With the end of WWII came great optimism, a new post modern society was the vision. Politicians saw their roles as architects of such a society. In July 1947 The Welfare State was officially launched. It aimed to provide a safety net for the population, to intervene in people’s lives and to provide where and when needed. The days of Laissez Faire were over – the state would provide. The Welfare State also aimed to eradicate the 5 great evils in the following ways…</p>
<p>Want: A universal benefits system was introduced. No longer were those in poverty forced to go cap in hand to the church, family members or charities. Many benefits were not means tested – they were universal, e.g. Child benefit is paid to all mothers irrespective of income.</p>
<p>Ignorance: The Tri-partite system was introduced as a result of the Bulter Education Act 1944. All students sat the 11+ and the result of this exam determined what school they then attended; Grammar School, Secondary Modern Schools, or Secondary Technical Schools. All students attended school until the age of 15 and it was free.</p>
<p>Squalor: Squalor means absolute and systemic poverty that is exacerbated by appalling living conditions, e.g. the Gorbals Tenements in Glasgow or the Victorian slums in many industrial cities e.g. Burnley, which were described as, ‘crowded, one of the most filthy and one of the most unhealthy villages…’ P144 Briggs.</p>
<p>In addition there was the opportunity that was created by the bombings of the major cities during WWII. People needed housing and needed it fast.</p>
<p>The result was The New Towns Act that were passed by Parliament in 1946. It enabled local authorities to build completely new towns in the following areas: England; Basildon, Bracknell, Corby, Harlow, Hatfield, Hemel Hempstead, Milton Keyes, Newton Aycliffe, Peterlee, Redditch, Runcorn, Skelmersdale, Stevenage, Telford, Washington, and Welwyn Garden City.</p>
<p>Idleness: People faced crippling unemployment. The Great Depression started in 1929 in the US but continued well into the 1930s and 1940, real economic activity only came as a result of WWII. People needed jobs and the government proposed a policy called ‘Jobs For All.’ Everyone who needed / wanted a job would be given a job by the government. This was relatively easy to achieve as the welfare state saw a massive building programme and subsequent job in health, education, benefits, etc.</p>
<p>The following graph show unemployment rates since WWII:</p>
<p>Disease: The government introduced the national Health System in 1947, for the 1st time ever all people had access to free GPs, Hospital care, midwives, Dentists, Opticians etc. Prescriptions were free, inoculations were given, the old killers; TB, Polio, etc were virtually eradicated. Infant mortality rates dropped, life expectance rose and it appeared that the initial spending by the state could be reduced as people were becoming dramatically healthier.</p>
<p>All of the above was free at the point of access. The Welfare State was paid for initially by government borrowing and National Insurance contributions.</p>
<p>One of the remarkable things about the Welfare State is that is saw the origins of ‘Consensus Politics.’ Consensus Politics can be defined as the ‘phrase used to describe the practice of government in Britain between 1945 and 1979. The phenomenon was observed by political scientists and media commentators; Britain’s two major political parties, the Conservative Party and Labour Party, were in agreement, or consensus, over certain basic government policies in the decades after World War II. The introduction of fundamental changes in government responsibility, such as the welfare state, the national health service (NHS), and widespread nationalization of industry, were effectively unchallenged by either party.’</p>
<p>Essentially this means that regardless of who was in power from 1945 to the mid 1970s both parties agreed to the broad principles of the Welfare State, Interventionism and State Control of Industry.’ Governments strived to be philanthropic in their nature, to support people, to enable people to realise their potential. Britain strived to become more meritocratic in nature. No longer would it be the case that people were given jobs due to their family, with a free education system according to, age, aptitude and ability’ theoretically anyone could rise from the lowest social class to the top jobs in society, John Prescott being a relatively good example of where this has been the case.</p>
<p>What led to the end of consensus politics is a matter of debate. James Callaghan’s Great Debate Speech at Ruskin College Oxford is cited as a turning point. Essentially he asked the questions: what has the Welfare state achieved thus far and, more importantly, what is the future? Here both main parties went their separate ways. Thatcher was elected in 1979 and with her came politics of the market and the New Right. During the 1980 Labour wet left on the political spectrum…</p>
<p>Thatcher sold off the Industrialised industries, she also introduced the broad principles of the market into the various parts of the Welfare State. This policy is know as markedization. Essentially the five major components of the Welfare State were re-orientated in way to create a more flexible workforce, and a way where the principles of the market were the most important. The important policies that were introduced during this time were:</p>
<p>Education: The Educational Reform Act 1988 – introduced OFSTED, League tables, GM schools, competition between schools. Passing exams became more important that gaining an education.</p>
<p>Health: ‘Ken Clarke’s mainly effective reforms. Health authorities were now purchasers buying broad block contracts from hospitals. Regional authorities took strategic decisions. Costs became more transparent; the one error was allowing competition on price. To ginger up the market, keen GPs held their own budgets to buy faster services for their patients, creating an unfair two-tier system. But this was a purely internal market with no private involvement and all cash staying in the NHS.’ The Guardian 7th October 2005</p>
<p>Housing: Council homes were sold off by Thatcher at greatly reduced rates, thus creating a need for more social housing and also a raft of new ‘middle class’ propertied people who now may well vote Conservative.</p>
<p>At its simplest, if the Welfare State were a safety net suspended beneath society to help people bounce back into work, affluence etc, the safety net was lowered, people would have to look after themselves again. The days of Big Interventionist Government were over as epitomised by Thatcher’s quote in 1987: “I think we’ve been through a period where too many people have been given to understand that if they have a problem, it’s the government’s job to cope with it. ‘I have a problem, I’ll get a grant.’ ‘I’m homeless, the government must house me.’ They’re casting their problem on society. And, you know, there is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women, and there are families. And no government can do anything except through people, and people must look to themselves first. It’s our duty to look after ourselves and then, also to look after our neighbour. People have got the entitlements too much in mind, without the obligations. There’s no such thing as entitlement, unless someone has first met an obligation.”</p>
<p>The New right dominated through to 1997. Blaire was elected on May 2nd 1997, at the celebration party they played d-ream ‘things can only get better.’ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHXA5GykEbw it appeared to be the start of a brave new era, underpinned by Giddens’ Third Way, neither left wing or right wing politics but a realistic and pragmatic combination of both and a smattering of blue skies thinking – the challenging of paradigms. Thirteen years later, subsequent elections, wars in Iraq, sleaze and MPs and it would appear that there was very little difference between Thatcher, Major, Blaire or Brown. All we have seen is the consensus politics after WWII replaced with neo-consensus politics that is to the right of the political spectrum. At the very least politicians campaign in poetry and govern in prose, to be frank they are at least disingenuous, at worse they are mere puppets.</p>
<p>The Marxist model of power advocates that power resides in the hands of the bourgeoisie, Britain is not a meritocracy of a democracy, and such notions are illusions perpetuated by the bourgeoisie to perpetuate false class consciousness. All the welfare state actually achieves is a proletariat who are educated, housed and healthy enough to be exploited by the bourgeoisie in the capitalist means of production. Politicians merely manage the affairs of the bourgeoisie. All legislation that has ever been passes is initially in the interests of the bourgeoisie. The welfare state for example is not some altruistic gift from government – it is actually paid for by the proletariat. If one were to consider the works of Althusser, Illich, Bowles and Gintis etc, then one might actually conclude that the welfare state is actually against the interests of the Proletariat.</p>
<p>To conclude one could look at Britain PLC. Postmodernism would argue that NGOs and TNCs are far more influential that nations – particularly small nations like the UK. What politicians do needs to be as a consequence of global factors. Young people today are competing for jobs with people in their own town as well as those from India and China and the skills that they need must reflect this fact. Future social policy will be very similar to legislation passed in other countries. This can be seen with the Health care reforms advocated by Obahma, or the educational policies in operation in Australia, we are becoming similar, globalization is happening, IT is creating a homogenous mass.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">INTRODUCTION</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Cerebrovascular<br/>
diseases include some of the most common and devastating disorders: ischemic<br/>
stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, and cerebrovascular anomalies such as intracranial<br/>
aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Most cerebrovascular diseases<br/>
are manifest by the abrupt onset of a focal neurologic deficit, as if the<br/>
patient was “struck by the hand of God” (Smith et al 2008).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Between<br/>
5% and 10% of stroke are due to subarachnoid haemorrhage (Aminoff 2007). Subarachnoid<br/>
haemorrhage typically presents with a sudden severe “thunder clap”<br/>
headache (often occipital) which lasts for hours or even days, often<br/>
accompanied by vomiting. There may be loss of consciousness at the onset, so<br/>
subarachnoid haemorrhage should be considered if a patient is found comatose. Since<br/>
1 patient in 8 with a sudden severe headache has had a subarachnoid<br/>
haemorrhage, clinical vigilance is necessary to avoid a missed diagnosis. All<br/>
patients with a sudden severe headache require investigation to exclude a<br/>
subarachnoid haemorrhage (Allen et al 2006).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Forty<br/>
five percent of patients die with in the first 30 days following subarachnoid<br/>
haemorrhage, nearly two third die as a result of the initial haemorrhage and<br/>
most within first two days (Parr et al 1996). Of those who survive more than<br/>
half are left with major neurologic deficits as a result of the initial<br/>
haemorrhage, cerebral vasospasm with infraction or hydrocephalus. If the<br/>
patient survives but the aneurysm is not obliterated the annual rebleed rate is<br/>
about 3% (Smith et al 2001).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Despite<br/>
vigorous therapeutic efforts, the mortality rate from subarachnoid haemorrhage<br/>
remains high. So the major therapeutic emphasis is on preventing the<br/>
predictable early complications of the rupture which in turn depends upon early<br/>
diagnosis and prompt therapeutic intervention. A greater understanding of the<br/>
basic mechanisms and pathology of subarachnoid haemorrhage may lead to more<br/>
effective prevention and therapeutic strategies. Early diagnosis of<br/>
subarachnoid haemorrhage requires good knowledge about clinical features and<br/>
using necessary investigating tools at an earlier and appropriate time. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">The<br/>
aim of writing this review article on subarachnoid haemorrhage is to understand<br/>
the details of subarachnoid haemorrhage including its pathophysiology, disease<br/>
presentation, management of such patients and future thinking.  </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""text-transform:uppercase"">CIRCLE OF<br/>
WILLIS</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">The<br/>
circle of Willis lies in the interpeduncular fossa at the base of the brain. It<br/>
extends from the superior border of the pons to the longitudinal fissure. It is<br/>
formed by the anastomosis between the two internal carotid arteries and the two<br/>
vertebral arteries. The anterior communicating, anterior carotid, posterior<br/>
communicating, posterior cerebral, and basilar arteries all contribute to the circle.<br/>
The circle of Willis allows blood that enters by either internal carotid or<br/>
vertebral arteries lobe distributed to any part of both cerebral hemispheres<br/>
(Snell 1997).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Two<br/>
types of branches arise from the circle and its major branches; these are<br/>
arbitrarily divided into cortical and central and they differ from each other<br/>
in the extent of their anastomosis. The central branches are very numerous and<br/>
slender; they tend to arise in groups and immediately pierce the surface of the<br/>
brain to supply its internal parts. The largest collections of these pass<br/>
through the anterior and posterior perforated substances. They do not anatomies<br/>
to a significant extent within the brain substance. The cortical branches<br/>
ramify over the surface of the cortex and anatomies fairly freely on the<br/>
piameter. They give rise to numerous small branches which enter the cortex at<br/>
right angles and like central branches, do not anatomies in it. It follows that<br/>
blockage of an artery on the piameter may produce little if any damage to the<br/>
brain but damage to branches entering the substances of the brain leads to<br/>
destruction of brain tissue (Romanes 1986). </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">The<br/>
arteries of brain are liberally supplied by sympathetic nerves which run on to<br/>
them from the carotid and vertebral plexuses. They are extremely sensitive to<br/>
injury and readily react by passing into prolong spasm. This of itself may be<br/>
sufficient to cause damage to brain tissue since even the least of neurons can<br/>
not withstand absolute loss of blood supply for a period exceeding seven<br/>
minutes (Romanes 1986). </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">In<br/>
85% of cases of spontaneous SAH, the cause is rupture of a cerebral aneurysm—a<br/>
weakness in the wall of one of the arteries in the brain that becomes enlarged.<br/>
They tend to be located in the circle of Willis and its branches. While most<br/>
cases of SAH are due to bleeding from small aneurysms, larger aneurysms (which<br/>
are less common) are more likely to rupture (Van Gijn et al 2007).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">In<br/>
15–20% of cases of spontaneous SAH, no aneurysm is detected on the first angiogram<br/>
(Rinkel et al 1993). About half of these are attributed to non-aneurysmal<br/>
perimesencephalic hemorrhage, in which the blood is limited to the subarachnoid<br/>
spaces around the midbrain (i.e. mesencephalon). In these, the origin of the<br/>
blood is uncertain (Van Gijn et al 2007).The remainder are due to other<br/>
disorders affecting the blood vessels (such as arteriovenous malformations),<br/>
disorders of the blood vessels in the spinal cord, and bleeding into various<br/>
tumors (Van Gijn et al 2007). Cocaine abuse and sickle cell anemia (usually in<br/>
children) and, rarely, anticoagulant therapy, problems with blood clotting and<br/>
pituitary apoplexy can also result in SAH (Warrell et al 2003; Rinkel et al<br/>
1993).</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">The<br/>
incidence and prevalence of unruptured intracranial aneurysms and aneurysmal<br/>
SAH should be considered separately. Intracranial aneurysms are found on<br/>
postmortem examination in between 1% and 6% of adults in large autopsy series<br/>
(Schievink 1997). The frequency of intracranial aneurysm seen during<br/>
angiography for patients not suspected of harboring an aneurysm is between 0.5%<br/>
and 1.0%. The overall incidence of SAH from aneurysms is approximately 7-10 per<br/>
100,000 people per year (Menghini et al 1998), but this figure includes children,<br/>
who have a very low incidence of rupture. The mean age of rupture is<br/>
approximately 50 years. Among adults older than 30 years of age, the incidence<br/>
of SAH is approximately 40-50 per 100,000 per year, and nearly one half of<br/>
these individuals die from their SAH. Various reviews have noted a slight<br/>
female predominance of SAH from aneurysms, with a mean age of haemorrhage of<br/>
approximately 50 years. Ruptured aneurysms rarely occur in children, and there<br/>
is a steady increase in the incidence of rupture from 0.3 per 10,000 persons<br/>
per year between 25 and 34 years of age to 3.7 per 10,000 persons per year for<br/>
patients 65 years of age or older. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">A<br/>
special category of patients are those who have a family history of aneurysms<br/>
and SAH. Familial occurrence of intracranial aneurysms is defined by the<br/>
presence of aneurysms in two or more first to third degree relatives without<br/>
any known hereditary disease. It is not known whether the pathogenesis of<br/>
familial intracranial aneurysms differs from that of the general population (Ronkainen<br/>
et al 1998). In a community-based study from Rochester, MN, the relative risk<br/>
of SAH among first-degree relatives of patients with the familial form of SAH<br/>
was four times higher than the general population. Other studies have shown<br/>
that in patients with familial intracranial aneurysms, there is a lower mean<br/>
age at the time of rupture compared with SAH in the general population (Ronkainen<br/>
et al 1998). Screening studies, with MRA, CT angiography, for the presence of<br/>
aneurysms in this group of patients appears warranted.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Saccular,<br/>
or berry, aneurysms are the most common form of aneurysms and are most often<br/>
responsible for aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. Saccular aneurysms may<br/>
arise from defects in the muscular layer of cerebral arteries that occur at<br/>
vessel bifurcations and from degenerative changes that damage the internal<br/>
elastic membrane, resulting in weakness of the vessel wall. They usually occur<br/>
on the first or second order arterial branches of the vessel emanating from the<br/>
circle of Willis. Evidence suggests that both genetic and environmental factors<br/>
contribute to the development of saccular aneurysms. The evidence that genetic<br/>
factors are important comes from the documented association of intracranial<br/>
aneurysms with heritable connective tissue disorders such as autosomal dominant<br/>
polycystic kidney disease, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, neurofibromatosis<br/>
type 1, and Marfans syndrome. The familial occurrence of intracranial aneurysms<br/>
also points to a role for genetic factors. In those patients who have a first<br/>
degree relative with an aneurysmal SAH, the risk of a ruptured aneurysm is four<br/>
times higher than the risk in the general population. A role for acquired<br/>
factors in the pathogenesis of saccular aneurysm is suggested by the mean age<br/>
of 50 for patients with aneurysmal SAH, and the increased incidence of<br/>
haemorrhage occurring with age. Cigarette smoking is a risk factor in all<br/>
population studies, and a role for systemic hypertension, although not as<br/>
strong as that of cigarette smoking, in the cause of aneurysm formation appears<br/>
likely.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Saccular<br/>
aneurysms may also be caused by infection, trauma, or neoplasm. Mycotic<br/>
aneurysms results from infected emboli that lodge in the arterial intima or the<br/>
vasa vasorum and account for approximately 5% of all intracranial aneurysms.<br/>
They occur most frequently in patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis,<br/>
congenital heart disease, or a history of intravenous drug use, and are usually<br/>
located on more distal branches of the cerebral vasculature. Proper management<br/>
includes appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy, with surgery in selected<br/>
cases. Fungal aneurysms, which are much rarer than bacterial, usually are<br/>
associated with arteritis and thrombosis and have been uniformly fatal.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Traumatic<br/>
aneurysms are rare but can be caused by either blunt or penetrating head<br/>
injury. Such aneurysms occur at sites other than bifurcations. Angiograms are<br/>
not routinely performed following head trauma, and these lesions may not be<br/>
detected, but they should be considered in patients who suffer delayed<br/>
deterioration. Early operative repair is recommended because of the high<br/>
mortality associated with these lesions. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Neoplastic<br/>
embolization, in rare cases, may produce an aneurysm in patients with choriocarcinoma,<br/>
atrial myxoma, and undifferentiated carcinoma. In forming an aneurysm, the<br/>
tumor embolus may remain viable, penetrate the endothelium, grow subintimally,<br/>
and eventually destroy the arterial wall. </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">An<br/>
unruptured berry aneurysm is a thin-walled out pouching at arterial branch points<br/>
along the circle of Willis or major vessels just beyond. Berry aneurysms<br/>
measure a few mm to 2 to 3 cm and have a bright red, shiny surface and a thin<br/>
translucent wall. Demonstration of the site of rupture requires careful<br/>
dissection and removal of blood in the unfixed brain. Atheromatous plaques,<br/>
calcification, or thrombotic occlusion of the sac may be found in the wall or<br/>
lumen of the aneurysm. Brownish discoloration of the adjacent brain and<br/>
meninges is evidence of prior haemorrhage. The neck of the aneurysm may be<br/>
their wide or narrow. Rupture usually occurs at the apex of the sac with extravasations<br/>
of blood into the subarachnoid space, the substances of the brain, or both. The<br/>
arterial wall adjacent to the neck of the aneurysm often shows some intimal<br/>
thicking and gradual attenuation of the media as it approaches the neck. At the<br/>
neck of the aneurysm, the muscular wall and intimal elastic lamina are usually<br/>
absent or fragmented, and the wall of the sac is made up of thickened<br/>
hyalinized intima. The adventitia covering the sac is continuous with that of<br/>
the parent artery.  </span></p>

aneurysms result from cystic medial necrosis or a traumatic tear in the<br/>
endothelium and sub adjacent layers of the artery, allowing the formation of a<br/>
false lumen. The false lumen may connect with the true lumen distally or may<br/>
rupture through the remaining external arterial wall. Such aneurysms can occur<br/>
in any portion of the extra cranial or intracranial arterial circulation.<br/>
Trauma is a common cause in the neck and anterior circulation, but is a rare<br/>
cause in the posterior circulation. Connective tissue diseases such as Marfans<br/>
syndrome and other disorders such as fibromuscular dysplasia predispose to<br/>
arterial dissections. </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">At<br/>
necropsy, subarachnoid haemorrhage is seen as a thin coating of blood in the<br/>
subarachnoid space over the surface over the surface of the brain and as a<br/>
rather thicker layer of blood around the ruptured aneurysm. The basal CSF cisterns<br/>
are often filled with blood which can be visualized by CT scan. If bleeding is<br/>
focal, it may indicate the location of an aneurysm but false localization may<br/>
occur if haemorrhage is intraventricular and has leaked through the foramen of<br/>
Luschka into the pontine cisterna around the basilar artery. Preliminary<br/>
removal of fresh blood</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">clot<br/>
from around the circle of Willis may reveal the aneurysm or may facilitate<br/>
dissection of the aneuryum in the fixed brain. If the blood clot around the<br/>
aneurysm is allowed to harden by fixation the aneurysm may be difficult to<br/>
locate or it may be damaged during the removal of the solidified blood clot (Sloam<br/>
et al 1990).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""In many cases of ruptured saccular aneurysm
there is significant intraventricular or intracerebral haemorrhage. In a
necropsy study of 133 patients with rupture saccular aneurysms ( Sloam et al
1990) intraventricular haemorrhage was observed in 40%, half of which are
caused by rupture of an anterior communicating artery aneurysm either through
the inferior medial portion of the frontal lobe or through the corpus collosum.
Intracerebral haemorrhage was seen in 39% of cases caused by middle cerebral
artery aneurysms in half of these (Sheffield &amp; Weller 1980).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="" text-align:justify=""""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">SAH<br/>
can alter mechanisms that control cerebral blood flow and metabolism. Chemical<br/>
control of blood flow by CO2 is altered in SAH patients (Graham 1990). Auto<br/>
regulation is commonly lost after SAH. Because the degree of impairment of auto<br/>
regulation may be different in different regions of the brain, a reduction in<br/>
cerebral perfusion pressure may cause extreme ischemia in some areas but not<br/>
others. These changes in the intrinsic control of cerebral blood flow are<br/>
particularly deleterious because several factors may operate to reduce cerebral<br/>
blood flow after SAH, including decreased cerebral perfusion pressure from the<br/>
raised intracranial pressure from the raised intracranial pressure caused by<br/>
acute hydrocephalus or clot formation (Hirashima et al 1999).</span></span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Blood<br/>
in the subarachnoid space triggers a pathological process that results in a<br/>
spasm of the vessels of the major branches of the circle of Willis. Increased<br/>
plasma platelet activating factor and antiphospholipids may contribute to the<br/>
pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm after SAH (Endo et al 1995). In Japan, there<br/>
is a study at Tokayama, to evaluate the usefulness of measuring<br/>
anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPLs) for the occurrence of symptomatic vasospasm<br/>
and the outcome after SAH. They explained the association of antiphospholipids<br/>
with worse outcome; aPLs were detected between 7 and 13 days after SAH. The<br/>
mechanism of transient aPLs is unclear but it is more likely to occur in the<br/>
severer grade patients. The reductions in platelet count, the increased<br/>
platelet factor 4 concentrations were also observed in aPLs-positive patients<br/>
with symptomatic vasospasm (Endo et al 1995).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Delayed<br/>
cerebral vasospasm that occurs after SAH seems to be associated with both<br/>
impaired dilator and increased constrictor mechanisms in cerebral arteries.<br/>
Mechanisms contributing arteries after SAH have been intensively investigated<br/>
in recent years. Nitric oxide is produced by the endothelium and is an<br/>
important regulator of cerebral vascular tone by tonic ally maintaining the<br/>
vasculature in a dilated state. Endothelial injury after SAH may interfere with<br/>
Nitric oxide (NO) production and lead to vasoconstriction and impaired<br/>
responses to endothelium vasodilators (Sobey et al 1998).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Inactivation<br/>
of NO by Oxyhaemoglobin or superoxide from erythrocytes may also occur in the<br/>
subarachnoid space after SAH. Nitric oxide stimulates activity of soluble<br/>
guanylate cyclase in vascular in vascular muscle leading generation of cGMP and<br/>
relaxation. Subarachnoid haemorrhage appears to cause impaired activity of<br/>
soluble granylate cyclase, resulting in reduced basal levels of cGMPin cerebral<br/>
arteries to nitric oxide. Endothelin(ET) is a potent, long lasting vasoconstrictor<br/>
that may contribute to the spasm of cerebral arteries after SAH. Endothelin is<br/>
present in increased levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of SAH patients.<br/>
Pharmacological inhibition of ET synthesis or ET receptors has been reported to<br/>
attenuate cerebral vasospasm. Production of and vasoconstriction by Endothelin<br/>
may be due, in part, to the decreased activity of Nitric oxide and formation of<br/>
cGMP (Sobey et al 1998).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt""></span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Protine<br/>
kinase C (PKC) is an important enzyme involved in the contraction of vascular<br/>
muscle in response to several agonists, including ET, activity of the PKC<br/>
appears to be increased in the cerebral arteries after SAH indicating that PKC may<br/>
be critical in the development of cerebral vasospasm. Recent evidence suggests<br/>
that PKC activation may occur in cerebral arteries after SAH as a result of<br/>
decreased negative feedback influence of NO/cGMP. Cerebral arteries are<br/>
depolarize after SAH, possibly due to decreased activity of potassium channels<br/>
may be due to several mechanisms, including impaired activity of Nitric oxide<br/>
(and/or cGMP) or increased activity of PKC. Thus endothelial damage and reduced<br/>
activity of Nitric oxide may contribute cerebral vascular dysfunction after SAH<br/>
(Sobey et al 1998). </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt""></span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Because<br/>
cerebral blood flow is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the<br/>
radius, small changes in vessel caliber can have profound effects. If regional<br/>
flow falls below the critical thresholds for membrane integrity, ischemic edema<br/>
formation and infraction can occur. Focal regions of edema can further impair<br/>
local blood flow despite on overall normal intracranial pressure. AVP (Arginine<br/>
vasopressin) plays an important role in the development of antidiuersis and<br/>
disturbance of the brain water and electrolyte imbalance after SAH ( Laszi et<br/>
al 1995).</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""text-transform:uppercase"">Unruptured<br/>
Aneurysms</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Most<br/>
unruptured intracranial aneurysms are completely asymptomatic. Aneurysms may<br/>
demonstrate evidence of their presence or of growth, before rupture, in other<br/>
ways besides headache. Premonitory manifestations depend on   the<br/>
location of the aneurysm and include diplopia, visual field deficits, or facial<br/>
pain (Weir 1994). </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">PHYSICAL FINDINGS</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Because<br/>
aneurysms can produce catastrophic haemorrhage before they reach a size that<br/>
would produce neurological deficits, the lack of clinical findings should not<br/>
preclude further diagnostic evaluation. The physical findings in patients with<br/>
unruptured aneurysms are determined in part by the size and location of the<br/>
aneurysm, although few aneurysms can be diagnosed with confidence on the basis<br/>
of clinical presentation alone. Thus aneurysms arising from the anterior<br/>
communicating artery can produce visual field defects, endocrine dysfunction,<br/>
or localized frontal headache. Aneurysms of the internal carotid artery can<br/>
produce oculomotor paresis, visual field deficits, impaired visual acuity, endocrine<br/>
dysfunction, and localized facial pain. Aneurysms of the internal carotid<br/>
artery in the cavernous sinus can produce a cavernous sinus syndrome when they<br/>
reach a sufficient size. Those of the middle cerebral artery can produce<br/>
aphasia, focal arm weakness, or paresthesias. Basilar bifurcation aneurysm can<br/>
be associated with oculomotor paresis, although the clinical features of<br/>
posterior circulation aneurysms seldom permit diagnosis before they rupture (Selman<br/>
et al 2004). </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""text-transform:uppercase"">Ruptured<br/>
saccular aneurysms</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">With<br/>
rupture of the aneurysm, blood under high pressure is forced into the subarachnoid<br/>
space (usually in relation to the circle of Willis), and the resulting clinical<br/>
events assume one of the three patterns:</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">(1)<br/>
The patient is stricken with an excruciating generalized headache and vomiting<br/>
and falls unconscious almost immediately; </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">(2)<br/>
Headache develops in the same manner but the patient remains relatively lucid-<br/>
the most common syndrome;</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">(3)<br/>
Rarely consciousness is lost quickly without any preceding complaint.<br/>
Decerebrate rigidity and brief clonic jerking of the limbs may occur at the<br/>
onset of the haemorrhage, in association with unconsciousness. If the<br/>
haemorrhage is massive, death may ensue in a matter of minutes or hours, so<br/>
that ruptured aneurysm must be considered in the differential diagnosis of<br/>
sudden death. A considerable proportion of such patients probably never reach a<br/>
hospital. Persistent deep coma is accompanied by irregular respirations,<br/>
attacks of extensor rigidity, and finally respiratory arrest and circulatory<br/>
collapse. In these rapidly fatal cases, the subarachnoid blood has greatly<br/>
increased the intracranial pressure to a level that approaches arterial<br/>
pressure and caused a marked reduction in cerebral perfusion. In some instances<br/>
the haemorrhage has dissected intracerebrally and entered the ventricular<br/>
system (Ropper &amp; Brown 2005).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Ruptured<br/>
of the aneurysm usually occurs while the patient is active rather during sleep,<br/>
and in a few instances during sexual intercourse, straining at stool, lifting<br/>
heavy objects, or other sustained exertion. Momentary valsalva maneuvers, as in<br/>
coughing or sneezing, have generally not caused aneurysmal rupture. In patients<br/>
who survive the initial rupture, the most feared complication is rerupture, an<br/>
event that may occur at any time from minutes up to 2 or 3 weeks (Ropper &amp;<br/>
Brown 2005). </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">In<br/>
less severe cases, consciousness, if lost, may be regained within a few minutes<br/>
or hours, but a residuum of drowsiness, confusion, and amnesia accompanied by<br/>
severe headache and stiff neck persists for several days. It is not uncommon<br/>
for the drowsiness and confusion to last 10 days or longer. Since the<br/>
haemorrhage is confined to the subarachnoid space, there are few if any focal<br/>
neurologic signs. That is to say, gross lateralizing signs in the form of<br/>
hemiplegia, hemiparesis, homonymous hemianopia, or aphasia are absent in the<br/>
majority of cases. On occasion, a jet of blood emanating from an aneurysm may<br/>
rupture into the adjacent brain or clot in the insular cistern and produce a<br/>
hemiparesis or other focal syndrome. There may also be a focal syndrome from acute<br/>
or delayed ischemia in the territory of the aneurysm-bearing artery. Usually<br/>
this occurs several days after a large subarachnoid hemorrhage. The<br/>
pathogenesis of such manifestations is not fully understood, but a transitory<br/>
fall in pressure in the circulation distal to the aneurysm is postulated in<br/>
early cases and vasospasm is responsible for the later focal signs. Transient<br/>
deficits are not common, but they do constitute reliable indicators of the site<br/>
of the ruptured aneurysm (Ropper &amp; Brown 2005). </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Convulsive<br/>
seizures, usually brief and generalized, occur in 10 to 25 percent of cases<br/>
according to Hart et al (but far less often in our experience) in relation to<br/>
acute bleeding or rebleeding. These early seizures do not correlate with the<br/>
location of the aneurysm and do not appear to alter the prognosis (Ropper &amp;<br/>
Brown 2005).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">In<br/>
most patients the neurologic manifestations do not point to the exact sight of<br/>
the aneurysm, but it can often be inferred from the location of the main clot<br/>
on CT scan. A collection of blood in the anterior interhemispheric fissure<br/>
indicates rupture of an anterior communicating artery aneurysm; in the sylvian<br/>
fissure, a middle cerebral artery aneurysm; in the anterior perimesencephalic<br/>
cistern, a posterior communicating or distal basilar artery aneurysm; and so<br/>
on. In some instances clinical signs provide clues to its localization, as<br/>
follows: </span></p>

</span><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Third nerve palsy<br/>
(ptosis, diplopia, dilation of pupil, and divergent strabismus), as stated<br/>
above, usually indicates an aneurysm at the junction of the posterior<br/>
communicating artery and the internal carotid artery- the third nerve passes<br/>
immediately lateral to this point; </span></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.75in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

</span><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Transient paresis<br/>

</span><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">The side on which<br/>
the aneurysm lies may be indicated by a unilateral preponderance of headache or<br/>
preretinal haemorrhage, the occurrence of monocular pain, or, rarely,<br/>
lateralization of an intracranial sound heard at the time of rupture of the<br/>
aneurysm. Sixth nerve palsy, unilateral or bilateral, is usually attributable<br/>
to raised intracranial pressure and is seldom of localizing value (Ropper &amp;<br/>
Brown 2005).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">In<br/>
summary, the clinical sequence of sudden severe headache, vomiting, collapse,<br/>
relative preservation of consciousness with few or no laterlizing signs, and<br/>
neck stiffness is diagnostic of subarachniod haemorrhage due to a ruptured<br/>
saccular aneyrysm (Ropper &amp; Brown 2005).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">The<br/>
initial clinical manifestations of SAH can be graded using the Hunt-Hess or<br/>
World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies classification schemes. For<br/>
ruptured aneurysms, prognosis for good outcomes falls as the grade increases.<br/>
For example it is unusual for a Hunt-Hess grade 1 patient to die if the<br/>
aneurysm is treated, but the mortality for grade 4 and 5 patients may be high<br/>
as 80%.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">The<br/>
laboratory evaluation of patients suspected of having a rupture aneurysmal SAH<br/>
uses a combination of CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging, lumber puncture and<br/>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">CT Scan</span></b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt""></span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style="" CT scan will detect blood locally or
diffusely in the subarachniod spaces or within the brain or ventricular system
in more than 90 percent of cases (if within 48 hours of bleed) and in
practically all cases in which the hemorrhage has been severe enough to cause
momentary or persistent loss of consciousness. This should therefore be the initial
investigative procedure. The sooner the CT scan is performed in relation to the
suspected hemorrhage the greater the likelihood of visualizing blood (Ropper
&amp; Brown 2005). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="" text-align:justify=""""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">The<br/>
blood may appear as a subtle shadow along the tentorium or in the sylvian or<br/>
adjacent fissures. A large collection of subarachnoid blood or a hematoma in<br/>
brain tissue or within the sylvian fissure indicates the adjacent location of<br/>
the aneurysm and the likely region of subsequent vasospasm, as already noted. A<br/>
high incidence of symptomatic vasospasm in the middle and anterior cerebral<br/>
arteries has been found when early CT scan shows sudarachnoid clots larger than<br/>
5*3 mm in the basal cisterns or layers of blood more than 1 mm thick in the<br/>
cerebral fissures. CT scan less reliably predicts vasospasm in the vertebral,<br/>
basilar, or posterior cerebral arteries (Ropper &amp; Brown 2005). Also,<br/>
coexistent hydrocephalus will be demonstrable. If the CT scan documents<br/>
subarachnoid blood with certainty, a spinal tap is not necessary. </span></span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">In<br/>
all other cases, where subarachnoid hemorrhage is suspected but not apparent on<br/>
imaging studies or computed tomography is unavailable but the patient is<br/>
oriented and obeying commands, a lumber puncture should be undertaken. Lumber<br/>
puncture should not be performed in patients with papilloedema or focal<br/>
neurological signs (Duffy 1982). Usually the CSF becomes grossly bloody within<br/>
30 min of the hemorrhage, with red blood cell counts up to 1 million/mm<sup>3</sup><br/>
or even higher. With a relatively mild hemorrhage, there may be only a few<br/>
thousand cells, but it is unlikely that a severe headache syndrome from<br/>
subarachnoid hemorrhage would be associated with less than a several hundred<br/>
cells. It is also probably not possible for an aneurysm to rupture entirely<br/>
into the brain tissue without some leakage of blood into the subarachnoid<br/>
fluid. In other words, the diagnosis of ruptured saccular aneurysm (by lumber<br/>
puncture) is essentially excluded if blood is not present in the CSF. Xanthochromia<br/>
is found after centrifugation if several hours or more have elapsed from the<br/>
moment of the ictus. In a patient who reports a headache that is consistent<br/>
with subarachnoid hemorrhage but the occurrence was several days earlier, the<br/>
CT scan may be normal and xanthrochromia the only diagnostic finding.  Also helpful after several days is the MRI<br/>
taken with the FLAIR sequence, with will demonstrate blood (Ropper &amp; Brown<br/>
2005).</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">A<br/>
rupture of an intracerebral haemorrhage due to hypertension, into the<br/>
subarachnoid space or the ventricles may be difficult to distinguish from a<br/>
subarachnoid haemorrhage occurring in a hypertensive patient and invading one<br/>
cerebral hemisphere. When the diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage has been<br/>
confirmed by CT scan or examination of cerebral fluid, therefore, it is<br/>
necessary to exclude a ruptured aneurysm or a bleeding angioma as its cause.<br/>
This may call for angiography, which raises the question of whether this should<br/>
be done in every case, and if so when (Yadav et al 1998).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">There<br/>
is a difference of opinion about this, some surgeons recommending that carotid<br/>
angiography should be performed in every case of subarachnoid haemorrhage as<br/>
soon as the diagnosis is made while others are more selective. The rational<br/>
answer seems to be that if there is possibility that a life saving operation<br/>
may be carried out as the result of information yielded by angiography,<br/>
angiography should be performed. If on the hand this is not the case because it<br/>
is thought that the patient is too ill to stand operation or that either<br/>
angiography or the operation is fraught with greater risks than expected<br/>
treatment. As may be the case particularly in patients over the age of 60 with<br/>
evident atheroma, angiography should be postponed. There is no doubt, however,<br/>
that surgery carried out sufficient early may save lives which would otherwise<br/>
be lost (Pathirana et al 1994).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Angiography<br/>
is usually carried out at the earliest convenience, although in patients in<br/>
poor clinical condition, the clinician may prefer to delay investigation until<br/>
improvement has occurred. If a patient deteriorates from the mass effect of an<br/>
intracranial haematoma, then emergency angiography is required prior to any<br/>
decompressive operation.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Four<br/>

angiography may show not only the site, size and shape of the aneurysm but also<br/>
whether as sometimes happens there is an associated spasm of important arteries<br/>
which may be contributing to the clinical picture (Lindsay et al 1997).</span></p>

is less sensitive than conventional arteriography to visualize anomalies<br/>
(Anzalone 1995). MRA is not sensitive enough to serve as a screening procedure<br/>
after SAH. It can be used however to detect unruptured aneurysms in selected<br/>
patients (Brust 1995). </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Negative angiography</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Angiography<br/>
fails to reveal a source of the subarachnoid haemorrhage in approximately 20%<br/>
of patients. In the presence of arterial spasm, reduction in flow may prevent<br/>
the demonstration of an aneurysm and repeat angiography may be required at a<br/>
later date (Jose et al 1996).Four vessels angiography confirms the presence of<br/>
an AVM and delineates the feeding and draining vessels. Reasonably small AVMs<br/>
are difficult to detect and only early venous filling may draw attention to<br/>
their presence. In the presence of a haematoma, angiography should be delayed<br/>
until the haematoma resolves, otherwise local pressure may mask demonstration<br/>
of AVM. If the angiogram is subsequently negative, then MRI is required to<br/>
exclude the presence of a cavernous malformation (Lindsay et al 1997).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Transcranial<br/>
droppler ultrasound assessment of proximal middle, anterior and posterior<br/>
cerebral and basilar artery flow is helpful in detecting the onset of<br/>
vasospasm, even prior to symptoms and following its course and response to<br/>
therapy (Donald et al 2001).Skull radiographs sometimes reveal calcification in<br/>
the AVM or increased vascular markings in the overlying bone (Brust 1995).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Associated Systemic Changes</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Acute<br/>
subarachnoid haemorrhage is associated with several characteristic responses in<br/>
the systemic circulation, water balance, and cardiac function. The ECG changes<br/>
include symmetrically large peaked T waves and other alterations suggesting<br/>
subendocardial ischemia. Also there is a tendency to develop hyponatremia; this<br/>
abnormality and its relationship to intravascular volume depletion play a key<br/>
role in treatment. Albuminuria and glycosuria may be present for a few days.<br/>
Rarely, diabetes insipidus occurs in the acute stages, but water retention or a<br/>
natriuresis is more frequent. There may be a leukocytosis of 15,000 to 18,000<br/>
cells per cubic millimeter, but the sedimentation rate is usually normal<br/>
(Ropper &amp; Brown 2005). </span></p>

&lt;p style="" text-align:justify=""""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Delayed<br/>
hemiplegia and other focal deficits usually appear 3 to 12 days after rupture<br/>
and rarely before or after this period. These delayed syndromes and the focal<br/>
narrowing of a large artery or arteries, seen on angiography, are referred to<br/>
as vasospasm. Fisher and coworkers (1975) have shown that spasm is most<br/>
frequent in arteries surrounded by the largest collections of clotted<br/>
subarachnoid blood. The vasospasm appears to be a direct effect of blood or<br/>
some blood product, possibly hematin or a platelet product, on the adventitia<br/>
of the artery. Areas of ischemic infraction in the territory of the vessel<br/>
bearing the aneurysm, without thrombosis or other changes in the vessel, is the<br/>
usual finding in such cases. These ischemic lesions are often multiple and<br/>
occur with great frequency, according to Hijdra and associates (1986).</span></span></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">After<br/>
a few days, arteries in chronic spasm undergo a series of morphologic changes.<br/>
The smooth muscle cells of the media become necrotic, and the adventitia is<br/>
infiltrated with neutrophilic leukocytes, mast cells, and red blood corpuscles,<br/>
some of which have migrated to a subendothelial position (Chyatte and Sundt). These<br/>
changes are caused by products of hemolyzed blood seeping inward from the<br/>
pia-arachnoid into the muscularis of the artery (Ropper &amp; Brown 2005).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">The<br/>
clinical features of cerebral vasospasm depend on the affected blood vessel but<br/>
typically include a fluctuating hemiparesis or aphasia and increasing confusion<br/>
that must be distinguished from the effects of hydrocephalus. In the past, an<br/>
arteriogram was required to verify the diagnosis, although it is not often<br/>
performed now because of the slight associated risk of worsening vascular spasm<br/>
and the ease with which the condition can be visualized with MRA and spiral CT<br/>
techniques. Transcranial Doppler measurements are an indirect and easier way of<br/>
following, by observations of blood flow velocity, the caliber of the main<br/>
vessels at the base of the brain. Almost all patients have a greatly increased<br/>
velocity of blood flow in the affected vessel that can be detected by this<br/>
method in the days after haemorrhage. However, progressive elevation of flow<br/>
velocity in any vessel (especially if over 175 cm/s) suggests that focal<br/>
vasospasm is occurring. There is a reasonable correlation between these<br/>
findings and the radiographic appearance of vasospasm, but the clinical<br/>
manifestations of ischemia depend on additional factors such as collateral<br/>
blood supply and the cerebral perfusion pressure (Ropper &amp; Brown 2005).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Recurrent Hemorrhage</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Recurrent<br/>
hemorrhage is a feared complication of SAH because it is a leading cause of<br/>
death or neurologic morbidity during the first 2 weeks after SAH (Roos et al<br/>
2000; Hillman et al 1998). The cumulative rate of rebleeding during the first 2<br/>
weeks after SAH is approximately 15% to 20% (Torner et al 1981). Torner and<br/>
colleagues (1981) found that the period of greatest risk for rebleeding is the<br/>
first 24 hours after the ictus; the risk peaked at approximately 4% during that<br/>
time. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt""></span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Several<br/>
clinical features identify those patients at the highest risk for early<br/>
rebleeding. The most important is the level of consciousness at admission;<br/>
patient admitted in coma at the greatest risk. Rebleeding is also more common<br/>
among older people, women, and people whose systolic blood pressure exceeds 170<br/>
mm Hg. The results of the baseline CT do not predict recurrent hemorrhage.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Recurrent<br/>
haemorrhage usually causes a sudden headache and a rapid change in neurologic<br/>
condition, including a drop in consciousness. Extensor spasm s and posturing<br/>
are important early signs. A “convulsion” that occurs immediately<br/>
after SAH also can mark a recurrent haemorrhage (Hart et al 1981). However,<br/>
rebleeding in a comatose patient may be overlooked. It may be manifested only<br/>
by a sudden change in respiratory pattern or vital signs. Recurrent haemorrhage<br/>
should be sought whenever a patient experiences a new headache or worsens<br/>
neurologically (Mohr et al 2004).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">The<br/>
differential diagnosis of rebleeding are vasospasm-induced brain ischemia, subacute<br/>
hydrocephalus, seizure, electrolyte imbalance, hypotension, hypoxia, medication<br/>
effects, systemic complication etc. The diagnosis of rebleeding should not be<br/>
solely on clinical features, because this approach leads to over diagnosis.<br/>
Recurrent haemorrhage can be proved most easily by the detection of additional<br/>
blood on CT scans (Mohr et al 2004).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Hydrcephalus</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Hydrocephalus<br/>
is a common complication of SAH, resulting from the massive collections of<br/>
blood that fill the ventricles, block the aqueduct of sylvius, or obstruct the<br/>
fourth ventricle. Blood can fill the subarachnoid cisterns or coat the<br/>
arachnoid villi (Mohr et al 2004).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""Sheehan and associates (1999) reported that
hydrocephalus developed in approximately one fourth of their patients during
the acute treatment period. Hydrocephalus is more common among patients who,
upon admission, have severe neurologic impairments or CT evidence of
ventricular dilation or intraventricular haemorrhage. In addition, women,
patients with preexisting hypertension, and patients with a history of alcohol
abuse have higher rates of hydrocephalus (Sheehan et al 1999).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="" text-align:justify=""""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">The<br/>
hydrocephalus after SAH may be classified according to its time of appearance<br/>
as (1) acute- appearing within 12 hours after aneurysmal rupture, (2) sub acute-<br/>
developing a few days after the ictus, or (3) delayed- noted as ventricular<br/>
dilation week to years later. Acute hydrocephalus is an important cause of<br/>
increased intracranial pressure and coma. Sub acute hydrocephalus is a cause of<br/>
a gradual decline in consciousness that can occur approximately 7 to 10 days<br/>
after SAH. In this situation, intracranial pressure may be modestly elevated.<br/>
Delayed hydrocephalus often manifests as a subacute dementia, gait apraxia, and<br/>
bladder incontinence. In the setting, intracranial pressure often fluctuates<br/>
and may not be consistently elevated (Mohr et al 2004).</span></span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Approximately<br/>
16% to 34% of patients have CT findings consistent with acute hydrocephalus.<br/>
Some patients with ventricular enlargement may be asymptotic, but most have<br/>
decreased consciousness. Symptoms of acute hydrocephalus in addition to decline<br/>
in alertness are bilateral motor signs, miosis, and downward deviation of the<br/>
eyes. Acute hydrocephalus predicts increased mortality and morbidity and is<br/>
correlated with subsequent development of vasospasm and ischemic stroke (Mohr<br/>
et al 2004).     </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">ACUTE MANAGEMENT</span></b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt""></span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">The<br/>
patient with recent SAH is critically ill and should be evaluated and treated<br/>
urgently (Mayberg et al 1994; Wijdicks 1995). He or she should be transported<br/>
rapidly to a medical center that has the expertise to treat a patient with a<br/>
ruptured aneurysm. Acute, potentially life-threatening complications should be<br/>
anticipated. Personnel should assess the patient quickly and should measure<br/>
vital signs and assess neurologic status frequently. The heart rate and rhythm<br/>
should be monitored. The airway, breathing, and circulation should be<br/>
supported, and if necessary, supplemental oxygen, endotracheal intubation, or<br/>
ventilatory assistance should be given (Wijdicks 1995). Intravenous access is<br/>
established to expedite emergency administration of medications. Normal saline<br/>
can be given at a slow rate to maintain patency of the intravenous line.<br/>
Unfortunately, the urgent approach to acute management of SAH is often<br/>
suboptimal in emergency departments (Thomson et al 2000). Each institution<br/>
should develop a protocol for the management of SAH in the emergency<br/>
department, including plans for both acute treatment and urgent evaluation.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">The<br/>
initial evaluation should include CT scan, chest radiograph, electrocardiogram,<br/>
and blood studies. CT can demonstrate subarachnoid blood and a number of other<br/>
acute intracranial complications. When CT shows intracranial bleeding, a lumber<br/>
puncture can be avoided. The findings of CT that is performed within 24 hours<br/>
after onset of symptoms with the use of third-generation scanners are normal in<br/>
approximately 2% to 7% of cases (Zouaoui 1997). If the CT findings are normal,<br/>
a cerebrospinal fluid specimen should be obtained.  </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt""></span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Patients<br/>
should be admitted to a unit that has monitoring equipment and is staffed by<br/>
neurologically trained nurses. Acute care can be divided into general<br/>
supportive efforts and therapies aimed at preventing or controlling specific<br/>
complications (Mayberg et al 1994; Wijdicks 1995). For the first 24 hours,<br/>
blood pressure, vital signs, and neurologic status should be assessed hourly.<br/>
Thereafter, examinations can be spaced further apart in stable patients.<br/>
Cardiac monitoring and, if necessary, continuous intra-arterial or noninvasive<br/>
blood pressure monitoring are extended for at least 24 to 48 hours after<br/>
admission.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Forced<br/>
bed rest is a traditional part of management. Visitors and external stimuli are<br/>
restricted. Passive range-of-motion exercises and frequent turning are<br/>
performed. A water mattress or an alternating- pressure pneumatic bed can<br/>
reduce the risk of pressure sores and atelectasis. Patients are assisted with<br/>
self-care activities, such as bathing and eating. Black and associates (1986)<br/>
showed that external pneumatic calf compression stocking and devices reduce the<br/>
incidence of deep vein thrombosis. The use of heparin as a prophylaxis against<br/>
deep venous thrombosis is generally avoided until the ruptured aneurysm is<br/>
treated. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Gentle<br/>
pulmonary suctioning and nursing care are important for avoiding pneumonia. The<br/>
value of absolute bed rest in preventing rebleeding was tested by the<br/>
cooperative study of Intracranial Aneurysms and Subarachnoid Heamorrhage; the<br/>
cumulative rate of rebleeding was 25% during the first 14 days after SAH<br/>
(Nishioka 1981). In general, the prognosis of patients treated only with<br/>
absolute bed rest now represents the natural history of SAH.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Because<br/>
intravenously administered medications are often needed, a slow infusion of<br/>
saline is continued. Alert patients are usually given a soft, high-fiber diet<br/>
supplemented by stool softeners (Wijdicks 1995). Caffeinated beverages are<br/>
avoided. Stuporous and comatose patients are not fed during the acute treatment<br/>
period. If a seriously ill person is stable several days after SAH and the<br/>
airway is secured, nasogastric feedings can be instituted.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""text-transform:uppercase"">Symptomatic<br/>
treatment</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Patients<br/>
with SAH are often confused or agitated as a result of brain injury,<br/>
hydrocephalus, or increased intracranial pressure. Pain or nausea can also lead<br/>
to irritability. Agitation raises the risk of rebleeding and aggravates<br/>
increased intracranial pressure. Control of pain or nausea can calm an upset<br/>
patient. Regular administration of diazepam or phenobarbital may be useful in<br/>
providing sedation for agitated patients.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">The<br/>
headache of SAH is intense, and patients should receive ample doses of<br/>
analgesics (Mayberg et al 1994; Wijdicks 1995). Most alert patients require a<br/>
medication such as codeine, meperidine, or morphine. The agent is usually<br/>
administered parenterally. These medications can be combined with<br/>
acetaminophen, hydroxyzine hydrochloride, or promethazine. Some patients have<br/>
photophobia; a quiet, dark environment can help relieve some of these<br/>
conditions, which otherwise might worsen the head pain. Sedation and sleep<br/>
might also help control pain. Aspirin affects platelet aggregation and prolongs<br/>
the bleeding time; there is concern that aspirin might potentiate rebleeding. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Severe<br/>
nausea and vomiting are common and important complaints, particularly during<br/>
the first 24 hours after SAH. Nauseated patients should receive an antiemetic,<br/>
such as ondansetron, trimethobenzamide, or prochlorperazine, to control these<br/>
complaints. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">ANTICONVULSANTS</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Approximately<br/>
25% of patients have seizures, most of which occur within the first 24 hours<br/>
(Hart et al 1981; Rhoney et al 2000; Sundaram et al 1986). Rhoney and<br/>
colleagues (2000) reported that seizures were most common among patients with<br/>
thick cisternal clots. Most seizures happen before the patient reaches the<br/>
hospital. Hart and associates (1981) noted that 63% of the seizures happened at<br/>
the time of aneurymal rupture. However, some of these ‘seizures’ may not be<br/>
truly epileptic phenomena but may represent transient decerebrate posturing<br/>
secondary to increased intracranial pressure (Hart et al 1981; Fisher 1975).  </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Although<br/>
seizures occurring after hospitalization are uncommon, they can be associated<br/>
with recurrent haemorrhage. Physicians prescribe anticonvulsants to patients<br/>
who have experienced a seizure as part of SAH, but the prophylactic use of<br/>
these agents in treatment of patients who have not had a seizure is<br/>
controversial. The rationale for prophylactic of anticonvulsants is  that a seizure is a dangerous event in a<br/>
person with a recent SAH. Because of the low rate of seizures after admission,<br/>
however, Hart and associates (1981) and sundaram and chow (1986) question the<br/>
necessity for routine prescription of anticonvulsants to patients with recent<br/>
SAH. However, regular use of phenytion or another parentrally administered<br/>
anticonvulsant is recommended to reduce the likelihood of seizures. No trial<br/>
has tested the value of anticonvulsants in management of patients with recent<br/>
SAH. Pending such a trail, the decision to prescribe these medications is<br/>
individualized. If a patient has had or is having convulsions, intravenous<br/>
doses of anticonvulsants are given.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""text-transform:uppercase"">Treatment of<br/>
Myocardial ischemia and cardiac arrhythmias</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Cardiac<br/>
arrhythmias can be detected in almost all patients during the first few hours<br/>
after SAH; in approximately 20% of cases, the arrhythmias can be severe or<br/>
life-threatening (Di Pasquale et al 1988, Manninen et al 1995, Oppenheimer et<br/>
al 1994, Randell et al 1999). Ventricular arrhythmias are a potential cause of<br/>
sudden death after SAH. Di Pasquale and coworkers (1988)<sup> </sup>noted<br/>
torsades de points in 3.8% of 132 patients with SAH who underwent Holter<br/>
monitoring. Increased QT dispersion is a common electrocardiographic finding<br/>
after SAH (Randell et al 1997).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Changes<br/>
resembling those seen in acute myocardial ischemia can be noted in 25% to 80%<sup><br/>
</sup>of patients ( Zouaoui et al 1997, Gascon et al 1983). In fact, many<br/>
people with SAH have secondary myocardial ischemia and left ventricular<br/>
dysfunction (Sakka et al 1999, Yuki et al 1991). Elevations of the cardiac<br/>
isoenzyme creatine kinase necrosis are found among patients who died of SAH<br/>
even those without prior history of coronary artery disease. Abnormal left<br/>
ventricular function is seen most commonly among patients with elevated<br/>
creatine kinase levels. Severe left ventricular dysfunction after SAH may<br/>
necessitate a delay in aneurysm surgery. In addition, the reduction of cardiac<br/>
output after severe SAH might increase the risk of cerebral ischemia secondary<br/>
to vasospasm. </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">ANTIHYPERTENSIVE TREATMENT</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Arterial<br/>
hypertension is common in SAH, resulting from elevations of catecholamines and<br/>
renin produced by hypothalamic disturbances (Neil-Dwyer et al 1980, Toftdahl et<br/>
al 1995) . Additionally, increased intracranial pressure can induce arterial<br/>
hypertension as a means to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion pressure.<br/>
Arterial hypertension also can be secondary to seizures, vomiting, agitation,<br/>
or pain. In addition, the patient may have preexisting hypertension. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Hypertension<br/>
after SAH has been found to correlate with increases in the risk of vasospasm<br/>
and mortality (Toftdahl et al 1995). Arterial hypertension also puts patients<br/>
at high risk for recurrent haemorrhage. Administration of antihypertensive<br/>
agents is a traditional component of early medical management of SAH (Mayberg et<br/>
al 1994, Wijdicks et al 1995). However, rapid or steep reductions in blood<br/>
pressure might be dangerous. Patients with vasospasm or increased intracranial<br/>
pressure may experience a drop in cerebral perfusion in conjunction with a<br/>
decline in blood pressure; neurologic deterrioration can result. Some antihypertensive<br/>
agents (nitroglycerin, sodium nitroprusside, fenoldopam) are potent cerebral<br/>
vasodilators, and enlargement of the cerebrovascular bed secondary to their<br/>
administration could further increase intracranial pressure.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">The<br/>
blood pressure often returns to normal after the patients with SAH is admitted<br/>
to the hospital or when symptoms such as headache are treated; thus, aggressive<br/>
antihypertensive therapy might be avoided in some cases. The levels of arterial<br/>
hypertension that mandates treatment is not known. Patients with moderate<br/>
hypertension (mean arterial blood pressure lower than 120 mm Hg) probably do<br/>
not need to be treated. On the other hand, patients whose mean blood pressure<br/>
is 120 mm Hg or higher or whose systolic blood pressure is higher than 180 mm<br/>
Hg should receive medication. The goal should be to cautiously lower the blood<br/>
pressure to levels normal for the patient and to avoid inducing hypertension. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Although<br/>
alert patients with elevated blood pressures can receive oral medications, parenteral<br/>
agents have the advantage of a prompt response. Antihypertensive agents that<br/>
were used before SAH are usually continued, and they should not be stopped<br/>
abruptly. Short-acting antihypertensive agents are desirable because of the<br/>
rapid resolution of the unwanted effects of an excessive decline in blood<br/>
pressure. Because patients are often dehydrated or hyponatremic, diuretics are<br/>
avoided. B-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting<br/>
enzyme inhibitors are the oral most commonly prescribed. Nimodipine or<br/>
nicardipine may be useful antihypertensive agents in the patient with SAH.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">The<br/>
patient with a markedly elevated or unstable arterial blood pressure reading<br/>
may require a continuous intravenous infusion of labetalol, sodium nitroprusside,<br/>
or fenolopam. The rate of infusion is adjusted in response to blood pressure<br/>
values. The dosage must be individuelized, because a patient may be very<br/>
sensitive to a medication, and the resulting drop in blood pressure may exceed<br/>
expectations. Doses required in patients with SAH can be lower than those<br/>
required for other hypertensive emergencies. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">MANAGEMENT OF ELECTROLYTE AND FLUID<br/>
BALANCE</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Disturbances<br/>
in water and sodium balance occur in approximately one third of patients with<br/>
SAH (Wijdicks et al 1985). These complications are most likely to develop in<br/>
critically ill patients with large hemorrhages. Hyponatremia and volume<br/>
depletion correlate with a poor prognosis and the subsequent development of<br/>
hydrocephalus, vasospasm, and ischemic stroke (Wijdicks et al 1985). Severe hyponatremia<br/>
can cause convulsions and is potential cause of coma.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">The<br/>
primary indication for rapid correction of hyponatremia is the development of<br/>
seizures in a patient without neurologic disease; however, this indication<br/>
becomes blurred in patients with recent SAH. In the past, hyponatremia after<br/>
SAH was attributed to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone<br/>
(SIADH) and was treated with fluid restriction. It is now recognized, that a<br/>
more common cause of hyponatremia in patients with SAH is cerebral salt wasting<br/>
(CSW). The mechanism of water and sodium loss in CSW has been correlated with<br/>
disturbances in levels of artial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic<br/>
peptide, and c-type natriuretic peptide, as well as with direct neural effects<br/>
of renal function (Harrigan 2001, Sviri et al 2000, Wijdicks 1997). </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">The<br/>
key to diagnosis of this syndrome is the urinary excretion of large amounts of<br/>
sodium and chloride at a time when the extracellular fluid volume is contracted.<br/>
Declines in plasma volume, red blood cell mass, and total blood volume occur<br/>
(Wijdicks et al 1985, Sato et al 1999) these findings are unlike those in SIADH,<br/>
in which the patient is euvolemic or hypervolemic. In contrast to therapy for<br/>
SIADH, the appropriate therapy for CSW is replacement of salt and water rather<br/>
than fluid restriction. Assessment of volume status by means of careful<br/>
recording of inputs and outputs to calculate sodium and chloride balance, daily<br/>
body weights, or laboratory test results suggesting dehydration, such as<br/>
elevated hematocrit or blood urea nitrogen-creatinine ratio, can be useful in<br/>
choosing therapy ( Harrigan  2001,<br/>
Carlotti et al 2001).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">If<br/>
the serum sodium concentration does not normalize despite a euvolemic status,<br/>
modest fluid restriction or an infusion of a hyperosmolar solution containing<br/>
sodium can be started. The serum sodium concentration should be corrected no<br/>
more rapidly than 0.7mEq/hour to avoid central pontine myelinolysis (Harrigan<br/>
2001). In 39 patients with recent SAH, Wijdicks and associates (1988)<br/>
administered 0.2 mg of fludrocortisone twice a day, combined with daily fluid<br/>
intake of at least 3L, and noted improvements in plasma volume and sodium<br/>
balance. As a result, these investigators recommend that frudrocortisone be<br/>
added to the fluid management regimen if the serum concentration of sodium is<br/>
less than 125 mmol/l. Hypokalemia after SAH probably results from vomiting but<br/>
can be secondary to elevated levels of corticosteroids, renin, or<br/>
catecholamines. Because cardiac arrhythmias can be associated with hypokalemia,<br/>
this imbalance should be corrected promptly. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Treatment of other medical complications</span></b></p>
<p><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Gastrointestinal bleeding<br/>
can result from hemorrhage gastritis, tress gastric ulcers, or an esophageal<br/>
tear secondary to vomiting. Because of the risk of bleeding, patients are often<br/>
given intravenous histamine2-receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors via<br/>
nasogastric tube (Mayberg et al 1994). Sucralfate does not have central nervous<br/>
system side effects, so it has potential advantages in preventing<br/>
gastrointestinal side effects among critically ill patients prone to depression<br/>
in consciousness (Wijdicks 1988). </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Obtunded<br/>
patients are at high risk for adult respiratory distress syndrome, atelectasis,<br/>
pulmonary hypoventilation, and aspiration pneumonia. Securing of the airway,<br/>
careful bronchopulmonary management, and ventilatory assistance may be<br/>
required. Events such as renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, and urinary tract<br/>
infections as well as other illness should be treated. Measures to avoid<br/>
pressure sores or orthopedic complications also are important.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Treatment of increased intracranial<br/>
pressure</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">A<br/>
decline in consciousness is the hallmark of increased intracranial pressure,<br/>
which, in turn, can result from a large intracerebral or intraventricular<br/>
hematoma, the mass effects of a secondary ischemic lesion, cerebral edema, or<br/>
hydrocephalus. SAH also causes vasoparalysis and loss of autoregulation;<br/>
secondary dilation of intracranial vessels might aggravate intracranial<br/>
pressure by expanding the vascular compartment. Intracranial pressure is<br/>
markedly elevated within a few minutes of aneurysmal rupture; the sudden<br/>
increase in pressure may help halt the bleeding. In addition, the elevated<br/>
intracranial pressure may transiently equal mean arterial blood pressure. A<br/>
massive rise in intracranial pressure is probably one of the causes of sudden<br/>
death after SAH. High intracranial pressure may also lead to hypoperfusion,<br/>
which induces brain ischemia. Prompt aggressive treatment of increased<br/>
intracranial pressure is one of the keys to successful management of SAH (Wijdicks<br/>
1995). </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt""></span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Several<br/>
medical and surgical measures are available to treat brain edema or increased<br/>
intracranial pressure. Continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure is<br/>
indicated for many patients; the results might guide the timing of surgical or<br/>
medical interventions. Continuous intraventricular drainage combined with<br/>
monitoring is an option if the patient has intraventricular haemorrhage or<br/>
acute hydrocephalus. Treatment of increased intracranial pressure consists of<br/>
(1) elevation of the head of the bed to promote venous drainage, (2) fluid<br/>
restriction, (3) correction of hyponatremia, (4) treatment of fever or<br/>
agitation, and (5) prevention of hypoventilation and secondary hypercarbia. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Intubation<br/>
and hyperventilation are indicated if a patient’s condition is deteriorating.<br/>
There is no evidence that dexamethasone is useful in managing brain edema after<br/>
intracranial hemorrhage. Furosemide, which can reduce intracranial pressure by<br/>
limiting the production of CSF, can be given in an emergency. However, the<br/>
diuretic effects of furosemide can lead to electrolyte disturbances and<br/>
hypovolemia. Mannitol is an osmotic agent that can be given to control<br/>
increased intracranial pressure. A response is noted within minutes, and the<br/>
duration of effect is approximately 4 to 6 hours. The dosage can be repeated as<br/>
needed. Secondary dehydration, hyperosmolarity, and a rebound increase in brain<br/>
edema are possible complications. Measurements of serum osmolality and serum<br/>
electrolytes should be performed often, especially if repeated doses of<br/>
mannitol are prescribed. Measurement of central venous or pulmonary artery<br/>
wedge pressure might be needed. Hypertonic saline has also been used in<br/>
refractory cases to lower intracranial pressure and has the advantage of<br/>
expanding intravascular volume (Qureshi &amp; Suarez 2000).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="" text-align:justify=""""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">A patient<br/>
with acute hydrocephalus can be observed, medically managed, monitored with<br/>
sequential CT studies, and treated with serial lumber punctures. Although acute<br/>
hydrocephalus may resolve spontaneously, most cases require placement of a<br/>
temporary ventriculocaval or ventriculoperitoneal catheter (Graff- Radford et<br/>
al 1989; Heros 1989). Insertion of a ventricular catheter may be difficult in a<br/>
patient with an intraventricular clot, because blood can occlude the<br/>
catheter.  Continuous cisternal drainage<br/>
might relieve intracranial and expedite lavage of blood from the subarachnoid<br/>
space. Placement of a shunt is recommended for any patient with depressed<br/>
consciousness and enlarging ventricles. Shunting is not always effective.</span></span></b></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">PREVENTION OF RECURRENT HEMORRHAGE</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Measures<br/>
to ameliorate recurrent hemorrhage are not effective; therefore treatment is<br/>
aimed at prevention. Choices include prolonged bed rest, induced hypotension,<br/>
antifibrinolytic agents, carotid ligation, intracranial clipping of the<br/>
aneurysm, and endovascular obliteration of the aneurysm. Occlusion of the<br/>
aneurysm is the best method for preventing rebleeding (van Gjin &amp; Rinkel<br/>
2001). Neither absolute bed rest nor induced hypotension has been successful in<br/>
improving outcomes after SAH or in reducing the risk of recurrent haemorrhage.<br/>
Carotid ligation can be performed to prevent rebleeding from aneurysms of the<br/>
distal internal carotid artery, but because of the advances in intracranial<br/>
operative techniques and development of invasive neuroradiologic procedures,<br/>
carotid ligation now is rarely performed (Perret &amp; Nibbelink 1981).  </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Antifibrinolytic therapy</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">The<br/>
rationale for the use of antifibrinolytic agents (aminocaproic acidor<br/>
tranexamic acid) is that the perianeurysmal clot that formed the initial<br/>
haemorrhage abuts and supports the aneurysm, thus helping to prevent its<br/>
re-rupture. Treatment would be given before surgery, to prevent rebleeding<br/>
while the patient was recovering from the acute effects of SAH.<br/>
Antifibrinolttic agents cross the blood brain barrier, but peak CSF levels of<br/>
these agents are lower than plasma levels and are also delayed. When the agents<br/>
are administered as a constant intravenous infusion, a steady state in CSF is<br/>
reached only after 36 hours. Therefore, the possible therapeutic level of agent<br/>
in the CSF may not be achieved during the period of highest risk for recurrent<br/>
haemorrhage. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Clinicians<br/>
are concerned about the safety of antifibrinolytic agents. A fulminant<br/>
myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, or myoglobulinuria can complicate prolonged use of<br/>
these medications (Brown et al 1983). Antifibrinilytic agents accentuate the<br/>
development of hydrocephalus (Graff-Radford et al 1989). Ischemic stroke is the<br/>
most feared side effects.  The high rate<br/>
of ischemic stroke is the primary reason that antifibrinolytic agents are not<br/>
established as effective in the acute management of SAH (Vermeulen et al 1984).  </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">INTRACRANIAL OPERATION</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Surgery<br/>
is an important component of management of SAH. Surgical repair involves<br/>
placing a metal clip across the aneurysm neck, thereby immediately eliminating<br/>
the risk of rebleeding. This approach requires craniotomy and brain retraction,<br/>
which is associated with neurologic morbidity. Currently, surgery is the<br/>
preferred treatment for the aneurysm, but the recommendation for surgery must<br/>
still be made on a case-by-case basis. For example, the patient’s age, the<br/>
severity of neurologic injury, or the presence of a serious comorbid disease<br/>
may weigh against an intracranial operation. Although people older than 60<br/>
years tolerate intracranial operation less well than younger people, age alone<br/>
is not a reason for excluding surgery from the treatment regimen, because<br/>
outcomes in the elderly have improved over time (Johansson et al 2001).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">For<br/>
most patients, the question is not whether the aneurysm should be clipped but,<br/>
rather, when is the ideal time for the operation. Some neurosurgeons advocate<br/>
delaying surgery until a patient’s condition has stabilized (Maurice-williams et<br/>
al 1997), but most neurosurgeons now favor early operation (Findlay 1997).<br/>
Early operation is preferred because the risk of rebleeding is elimination and<br/>
the operation is performed before vasospasm appears. The primary reason for<br/>
delaying surgery has been that a lag permits the patient’s condition to recover<br/>
from the initial event before the patient is subjected to the stresses<br/>
associated with early surgery. Delayed surgery leaves the aneurysm untreated<br/>
during the period of highest risk of rebleeding. In addition, the potential of<br/>
recurrent rupture of an unsecured aneurysm can complicate hypervolumic hemodilution<br/>
and induced hypertension for treatment of ischemia secondary to vasospasm.<br/>
Surgeons rightfully point out that the overall results of management, and not<br/>
just postoperative statistics, should be compared. The overall results of early<br/>
medical treatment followed by a delayed operation are not satisfactory. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Several<br/>
groups described favorable results of early operation combined with a variety<br/>
of interventions, including calcium channel blockers (Juvela et l989, LeRoux et<br/>
al1995, Nishimoto et al 1985). A small trial in Finland, demonstrated better<br/>
outcomes for early operation (Ohman and Heiskanen 1989). Although the data<br/>
favored early operation, the results were distorted by a simultaneous random<br/>
assignment of patients to receive either placebo or active treatment with<br/>
calcium channel blocking agents. Miyaoka and associates (1993) reported better<br/>
management results with early surgery in patients who were in good condition<br/>
and better results with delayed operation in patients who were seriously ill. A<br/>
large international epidemiologic study evaluated outcomes of 3521 patients<br/>
hospitalized within 3 calendar days of SAH (Kassellet al 1990). Although it was<br/>
not a randomized trial, the large numbers assured that prognostic factors were<br/>
similar in the groups that underwent early and delayed operations. Overall<br/>
management results (favorable outcomes) were similar in the two treatment<br/>
groups, but early surgery did reduce the overall risk of rebleeding. Early<br/>
surgery was not associated with a high rate of intraoperative complication,<br/>
such as a re-rupture of the aneurysm or worsening of brain edema. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Endovascular<br/>
obliteration of the aneurysm or the parent artery is used to treat aneurysms of<br/>
the intracavernous or proximal portions of the internal carotid artery, even in<br/>
patients who have a carotid-cavernous fistula. Tandem placement of balloons in<br/>
the parent artery (trapping) can shrink the aneurysm or lead to its occlusion (Findlay<br/>
1997). This procedure is relatively effective, and the risk of ischemic stroke<br/>
is low (Larson et al 1995). However, detachable balloons can be relatively<br/>
difficult to place within the aneurysm. The sizes and shapes of the balloons<br/>
might not correspond to the contour of the aneurysmal sac. Occasionally, the<br/>
balloons can be lost and migrate into distal arteries. In addition, the<br/>
balloons can deflate, and the aneurysm can become recanalized. Finally, the<br/>
balloons might place pressure on the aneurysm’s wall and promote recurrent<br/>
rupture. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Endovascular<br/>
placement of adhesive materials can be used to occlude smaller intracranial<br/>
aneurysms. Kinugasa and associates (1995) reported success with the placement<br/>
of cellulose acetate polymer for occlusion in 9 of 12 patients with aneurysms.<br/>
Obliteration of the aneurysmal sac expedited treatment of vasospasm and allowed<br/>
the patients to become stable before the aneurysm was surgically repaired. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Development<br/>
of microcatheters and detachable coils has stimulated greater interest in<br/>
direct endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms (McDougall 1996).<br/>
Aneurysms that are not easily approached for direct clipping might be occluded<br/>
with endovascular treatment (McDougall 1996, Casasco et al 1993, Sinson et al<br/>
1996). In particular, aneurysms of the posterior circulation and the basilar<br/>
bifurcation can be treated with placement of coils (Birchall et al 2001). In<br/>
one multicenter trail comprising 150 patients, basilar tip aneurysms were<br/>
treated with detachable platinum coils; approximately 75% of the aneurysms were<br/>
successfully treated (Eskridge &amp; Song 1998). The periprocedural mortality<br/>
rate was 2.7%. Complications included rupture of the aneurysm and occlution of<br/>
the parent artery. Cognard and colleagues (1998) treated 208 patients with<br/>
aneurysms (150 with SAH), achieving total occlusion of the aneurysms in 81% of<br/>
cases, and subtotal occlusion in 17%. In another study, 75 seriously ill<br/>
patients with ruptured aneurysms were treated with coils (Raymond and Roy 1997).<br/>
Success was achieved in most patients, although procedure-related mortality and<br/>
morbidity occurred in 8% of cases. Lefkowtz and coworkers (1999) placed coils<br/>
in wide-necked aneurysms in 23 patients; complete or nearly complete occlusion<br/>
was achieved in all cases. Three patients had complications. Although the<br/>
usefulness of endovascular placement of coils has not been compared with that<br/>
of surgery, this therapy has gained popularity and likely will continue to<br/>
increase in popularity in the future.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Early<br/>
intracranial operation and lavage of the subarachnoid space can remove clots<br/>
and might prevent development of vasospasm. The rationale for this procedure is<br/>
that evacuation of the clots might prevent the release of substances that<br/>
induce the arterial narrowing. Surgical removal of the clots can be difficult<br/>
in critically ill patients, however, and some of the blood collects in areas<br/>
far from the operative field. Extensive manipulation of the brain to remove the<br/>
subarachnoid clots may also injure penetrating vessels, leading to ischemic<br/>
deficits. Despite promising study did not show any reduction in the severity or<br/>
incidence of vasospasm (Kassell et al 1990). It appears that vigorous lavage of<br/>
the subarachnoid space is not a feasible way to prevent vasospasm in most<br/>
patients. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Several<br/>
small studies report the potential usefulness of intrathecal thrombolytic<br/>
therapy in the setting of acute surgical treatment of a ruptured aneurysm<br/>
(Brinker et al 1992, Mizoi et al 1993, Sasaki et al 1994, Usui et al 1994) .<br/>
Most of these studies treated only patients judged to be at very high risk for<br/>
vasospasm and ischemia. Outcomes were generally favorable, consisting of a<br/>
lower frequency of severe vasospasm and ischemic impairments (Treggiari-Venzi<br/>
et al 2001). Kodama and associates (2000) performed cisternal irrigation with<br/>
urokinase and ascorbic acid in 217 high-risk patients, and observed subsequent<br/>
symptomatic vasospasm in 6 patients. Thrombolytic agents can be instilled<br/>
safely into the basal cisterns. Thrombolytic agents can be instilled safely<br/>
into the basal cisterns. The risk of major bleeding complications, in<br/>
particular brain haemorrhage, thrombolytic agents should not be administered<br/>
until the aneurysm has been occluded. The optimal timing of treatment, the<br/>
duration of treatment, the best agent, and the best dose are not known.<br/>
Considerable research, including prospective controlled trials, is needed<br/>
before intrathecal thrombolytic agents are added to the usual care of patients<br/>
with recently ruptured aneurysms.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKING AGENTS </span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Influx<br/>
of extracellular calcium, an important component in sustaining contraction of<br/>
smooth muscle, is critical in the process of cellular ischemia. An agent that<br/>
inhibits calcium entry might prevent vasospasm or its cerebral ischemic<br/>
consequences. The diyhdropyridine derivatives nimodipine and nicardipine have been<br/>
tested. Although these agents can reduce the arterial blood pressure, they also<br/>
increase cerebral blood flow, including in ischemic regions. Small studies<br/>
testing the utility of oral nimodipine found that the medication reduced<br/>
mortality but it did not prevent vasospasm (Allen et al 1983, Ohman et al 1991).<br/>
A British trail established the utility of nimodipine to improve outcomes after<br/>
SAH (Pickard et al 1989).  The rate of<br/>
favorable outcome was increased from 67% to 80.2% with treatment. Meta-analyses<br/>
confirm the efficacy of nimodipine in treating patients with recent SAH (Barker<br/>
and Ogilvy 1996, Feigin et al 2000, Tettenborn and Dycka 1990). Although a<br/>
significant reduction in mortality is not achieved, the calcium channel<br/>
antagonists reduce the proportion of patients with ischemic deficits secondary<br/>
to vasospasm. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">In<br/>
general, nimodipine is safe, and complications of its use are few. Hypotension<br/>
is a potential side effect. The exact mechanism of nimodipine’s efficacy is<br/>
unclear, but it may be neuroprotective. Patients with recently ruptured<br/>
aneurysms should receive nimodipine as part of their general medical care<br/>
(Mayberg et al 1994, Ven Gijn and Rinkel 2001). The U.S. Food and Drug<br/>
Administration have approved the use of nimodipine for this indication. The<br/>
usual oral dosage of nimodipine is 60 mg every 4 hours. Comatose patients can<br/>
receive the medication via a nasogastic tube. The usual duration of treatment<br/>
is 3 weeks after SAH, although a shorter course (10 to 14days) may be all that<br/>
is needed. If the SAH is not diagnosed until 10 to 14 days after it has<br/>
occurred, the patient has already survived the period of greatest risk for<br/>
ischemia, and nimodipine might not be needed.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Nicardipine<br/>
has similar potential theraputic actions, and it can be given parenterally. Use<br/>
of the agent in SAH was tested in a large clinical trial (Haley et al 1993). At<br/>
3 months, the actively treated and control groups had comparable rates of<br/>
favorable outcomes, but the frequency of symptomatic vasospasm was reduced with<br/>
the use of nicardipine. In  another<br/>
study comparing two different doses of nicardipine, the same investigators<br/>
found that the lower dose of medication was associated with a slightly higher<br/>
rate of severe vasospasm but that outcomes were similar in the two groups (Haley<br/>
et al 1994). Shibuya and colleagues (1994), who administered nicardipine<br/>
intrathecally to 50 patients with SAH, noted declines in both symptomatic and<br/>
arteriographic vasospasm. These studies suggest that nicardipine is effective<br/>
in preventing ischemic sequelae of SAH but that the combination of aggressive<br/>
volume expansion and induced hypertension is also effective. These additional<br/>
data support the use of calcium channel blockers supplemented by hypervolemic<br/>
hemodilution and induced hypertension for prevention of ischemic stroke after<br/>
SAH.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Calcitonin<br/>
gene-related peptide (CGRP), a potent vasodilator, was tested in a small<br/>
clinical trial (Lancet 339:891-834, 1992). Hypotension was a common side effect,<br/>
and two thirds of the treated patients did not complete of the course of<br/>
treatment. Although this study was reported as having negative results for the<br/>
use of CGRP, largely because of its small size, favorable outcomes were noted<br/>
in 60% of treated patients and 60% of controls.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Clinical<br/>
studies of super selective intra-arterial administration of papaverine that<br/>
this potent vasodilator may be helpful (Clouston et al 1995). Firlik and<br/>
coworkers (1999) found that intraarterial papaverine can reverse the arterial<br/>
narrowing of vasospasm. In their series of 15 patients (32 treated arteries),<br/>
pavaverine therapy increased cerebral blood flow in 46% of cases and led to<br/>
major clinical improvement in 26%. Kaku and associates (1992) reported that<br/>
this agent should be given before the arteries lose their ability to respond.<br/>
Hypotension does not appear to be a complication of local intra-arterial<br/>
infusions. Seizures have been reported as a complication of this therapy (Carhuapoma<br/>
et al 2001). Arakawa and colleagues (2001) reported that the vasodilator<br/>
milrinone might be helpful in dilating vasospastic vessels. </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Finfer<br/>
and associates (1999) used barbiturate- induced coma to protect the brain in 11<br/>
patients with severe vasospasm, 10 of whom had good outcomes. These investigators<br/>
proposed this therapy for patients who show no response to other medical<br/>
interventions. Although barbiturate-induced coma does offer benefit, it is a<br/>
very vigorous therapy that requires intensive adjunctive care. It utility has<br/>
not been established.</span></p>

Clinical trails have been conducted to test intravenously administered<br/>
tirilazed given as a supplement to oral nimodipine (Haley et al 1997, Kassell<br/>
et al 1996, Lanzino and Kassell 1999). Although the medication was well<br/>

The medication has not been approved for management of patients with SAH.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">HYPERVOLEMIC HEMODILUTION AND INDUCED<br/>
HYPERTENSION</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Increasing<br/>
cerebral blood flow can ease ischemic symptoms and can prevent permanent<br/>
neurologic sequelae (Mayberg et al 1994, Kassell et al 1982, Mori et al 1995).<br/>
Reduction in the diameter of the vascular lumen affects the blood’s rheologic<br/>
characteristies and, thus, influences flow. <br/>
Severe losses of water and sodium result in hemoconcertration, which in<br/>
turn increases viscosity and reduces blood flow. Measures to prevent infarction<br/>
by correcting the losses of sodium and water are initiated upon the patient’s<br/>
admission to the hospital. A small randomized trial of prophylactic therapy<br/>
with hypervolemic hypertensive hemodilution therapy did not demonstrate benefit<br/>
in preventing vasospasm (Mori et al 1995).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Because<br/>
autoregulation is impaired, cerebral blood flow becomes pressure-dependent.<br/>
Cerebral perfusion pressure is altered by changes in the mean arterial blood<br/>
pressure and intracranial pressure. Improvement of venous drainage by positioning<br/>
and elevation of the head, treatment of brain edema, and control of<br/>
hydrocephalus lowers intracranial pressure and improves perfusion. When<br/>
feasible, antihypertensive agents are avoided. Nimodipine may have to be<br/>
discontinued so that the blood pressure can be effectively raised. After the<br/>
diagnosis of symptomatic vasospasm is made, more aggressive treatment of increased<br/>
intracranial pressure, including hyperventilation and mannitol, might help.<br/>
Antifibrinolytic agents should be discontinued.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Several<br/>
groups report reversal of ischemic symptoms with the combination of volume<br/>
expansion and drug induced hypertension (Kassell et al 1982, Mori et al 1995). In<br/>
some cases, neurologic signs can reappear when the therapy is discontinued (Kassell<br/>
et al 1982) Although no controlled trials of this regimen have been conducted,<br/>
the previously described trial of nicardipine demonstrates a benefit from this<br/>
aggressive therapy(Haley et al1993). Qureshi and associates (2000) found that<br/>
patients with a depressed level of consciousness at the initiation of volume<br/>
expansion therapy on blood flow and cardiac function (Lennihan et al 2000).  The investigators found that hypervolemic<br/>
therapy raised cardiac filling pressures but it did not increase cerebral blood<br/>
flow. A meta -analysis of published data found that there is no sound evidence<br/>
for or against the use of volume expansion therapy in patients with SAH (Feigin<br/>
et al 2000). </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">If<br/>
improvement is not observed after volume expansion, a vasopressor (most<br/>
commonly dopamine or phenylephrine) is added in an attempt to increase mean<br/>
arterial blood pressure. Darby and coworkers (Darby et al 1994) noted that the<br/>
increase in cerebral blood flow after use of dopamine may be independent of<br/>
changes in blood pressure, because the dopamine might have direct<br/>
cerebrovascular effects. Although there is some disagreement about the utility<br/>
of hypervolemic hemodilution and induced hypertension to prevent ischemia after<br/>
SAH, the regimen is commonly prescribed (van Gijn &amp; Rinkel. 2001, Oropellet<br/>
et al 1996, Ullman &amp; Bedersom 1996).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">This<br/>
therapy is vigorous, and patients need intensive observation. Arterial<br/>
pressure, cardiac rhythm, central venous pressure, or pulmonary artery wedge<br/>
pressure should be continuously monitored (Mori et al 1995). Continuous<br/>
intracranial pressure monitoring may be also needed. Frequent laboratory<br/>
assessments of serum electrolytes, serum osmolarity, blood gases, and blood<br/>
counts are needed. Complications of the therapy include congestive heart<br/>
failure, pulmonary edema, acute myocardial infraction, and cardiac arrhythmias.<br/>
Worsening of brain edema, hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage, haemorrhagic<br/>
transformation of the infraction, and re-rupture of the aneurysm can also occur(Kassell<br/>
et al 1996). Shimoda and colleagues (1993) reported worsening of brain edema in<br/>
18 of their 94 patients undergoing hypervolemic hemodilution; 8 others had<br/>
haemorrhagic infractions. These investigators advised against the use of<br/>
hypervolemic hemodilution if a patient’s CT scan shows an ischemic lesion in<br/>
the brain, particularly if the abnormality is found within 6 days of SAH.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">ANGIOPLASTY</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Transluminal<br/>
angioplasty successfully dilates vasospastic arteries (Coyne et al 1994). The<br/>
development of microballoons allows for catheterization in small- to medium-sized<br/>
arteries at the base of the brain. Angioplasty does stretch and disrupt the<br/>
arterial wall (Honma et al 1995). Bejjani and associates (1998) performed angioplasty<br/>
at approximately 7 days after SAH in 31 patients, treating a total of 81<br/>
vessels. These investigators noted major clinical improvements in 12 cases and<br/>
moderate improvements in another 11. They encountered no major neurologic<br/>
complications and concluded that angioplasty is a potentially useful treatment<br/>
for patients who show no response to other therapies. Polin and coworkers<br/>
(2000) found that angioplasty is effective in reversing angiographically<br/>
confirmed vasospasm, but they did not observe clinical improvements with<br/>
treatment. At present, angioplasty is usually reserved for treatment of SAH<br/>
that does not respond to medical measures.</span></p>

Malformations of the BRAIN :<sup>( ROPPER &amp; brown 2005)</sup></span></b><sup><span style=""font-size:11.0pt""></span></sup></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">An<br/>
arteriovenous malformation (AVM) consists of a tangle of dilated vessels that<br/>
from an abnormal communication between the arterial and venous systems, really<br/>
an arteriovenous fistula. It is a developmental persistence of an embryonic<br/>
pattern of blood vessels and is not a neoplasm, but the constituent vessels may<br/>
proliferate and enlarge with the passage of time. Arteriovenous malformations<br/>
have been designated by a number of other terms, such as angioma and<br/>
arteriovenous aneurysm, but these are less appropriate; angioma suggests a<br/>
tumor, and the term aneurysm is generally reserved for the lesions described in<br/>
the preceding section. Venous malformations, consisting purely of distended<br/>
veins deep in the white matter, are a separate entity; they may be the cause of<br/>
seizures and headaches but seldom of haemorrhage. When a small haemorrhage<br/>
occurs in relation to venous malformation, it is due to an associated cavernous<br/>
malformation.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Vascular<br/>
malformations vary in size from a small blemish a few millimeters in diameter<br/>
lying in the cortex or white mater to a huge mass of tortuous channels<br/>
constituting an AV shunt of sufficient magnitude, in rare instances, to raise<br/>
cardiac output. Hypertrophic dilated arterial feeders can be seen approaching<br/>
the main lesion and to break up into a network of thin-walled blood vessels<br/>
that connect directly with draining veins. The latter often from greatly<br/>
dilated, pulsating channels, carrying away arterial blood. The tangled blood<br/>
vessels interposed between arteries and veins are abnormally thin and do not<br/>
have the structure of normal arteries or veins. Arteriovenous malformations<br/>
occur in all parts of the cerebrum, brainstem, and cerebellum (and spinal<br/>
cord), but the larger ones are more frequently found in the central part of a<br/>
cerebral hemisphere, commonly forming a wedge-shape lesion extending from the<br/>
cortex to the ventricle. Some lie on the dural surface of the brain or spinal<br/>
cord, but these most often turn out to be direct arteriovenous fistulas.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">When<br/>
heamorrhage occurs, blood may enter the subarachniod space, producing a picture<br/>
almost identical to that of ruptured saccular aneurysm, but generally less<br/>
severe; since most AVMs lie within cerebral tissue, bleeding is more than<br/>
likely to be intracerebral as well, causing a hemiparesis, hemiplegia, and so<br/>
forth, or even death. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Arteriovenous<br/>
malformations are about one-tenth as common as saccular aneurysms and about<br/>
equally frequent in males and females. The two lesions-AVM and saccular<br/>
aneurysm are associated in about 5 percent of cases; the conjunction increases<br/>
with the size of the AVM and the age of the patient (Miyasaka et al 1982).<br/>
Rarely, AVMs occur in more than one member of a family in the same generation<br/>
or successive ones. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Bleeding<br/>
or seizures are the main modes of presentation. Most AVMs are clinically silent<br/>
for a long time, but sooner or later they bleed. The first haemorrhage may be<br/>
fatal, but in more than 90 percent of cases the bleeding stops and the patient<br/>
survives. The rate of haemorrhage in untreated patients is established to be 2<br/>
to 4 percent per year, far lower than aneurysms. The mortality rate in two<br/>
major series (Crawford et al 1986, Ondra et al 1994) has been 1 to 2 percent<br/>
per year but as high as 6 to 9 percent in the immediate year following a first haemorrhage.<br/>
The matter of an increased risk of AVM rupture during pregnancy has been<br/>
disputed. The weight of evidence suggests that the risk is not raised by<br/>
pregnancy alone, but -as with saccular aneurysm- that parturition and Valsalva<br/>
activity is always a source of concern. Before rupture, chronic, recurrent<br/>
headache may be a complaint; usually the headache is of a nondescript type, but<br/>
a classic migraine with or without neurologic accompaniment occurs in about 10<br/>
percent of patients-probably with greater frequency than it does in the general<br/>
population. Most of the lesions associated with migraine-like headaches lie in<br/>
the parietal-occipital region of one cerebral hemisphere, and about two-thirds<br/>
of such patients have a family history of migraine.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Huge<br/>
AVMs may produce a slowly progressive neurologic deficit because of compression<br/>
of neighboring structures by the enlarging mass of vessels and by shunting of<br/>
blood through greatly dilated vascular channels (“intracerebral<br/>
steal”), resulting in hypoperfusion of <br/>
the surrounding brain(Homan et al 1986). When the vein of Galen is<br/>
enlarged as a result of drainage from an adjacent AVM, hydrocephalus may<br/>
result. Not infrequently one or both carotid arteries pulsate unusually forcefully<br/>
in the neck. A systolic bruit heard over the carotid  in the neck or over the mastoid process or<br/>
the eyeballs in a young adult is almost pathognomonic of an AVM. However, such<br/>
bruits have been heard in fewer than 25 percent of our patients. Exercise that<br/>
increases the pulse pressure may bring out a bruit if none is present at rest.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Fully<br/>
95 percent of AVMs are disclosed by CT scans if enhanced and an ever larger<br/>
number by MRI. Magnetic susceptibility MRI shows small areas of previous<br/>
bleeding around AVMs. Arteriography is usually necessary to establish the<br/>
diagnosis with certainty and will demonstrate AVMs larger than 5 mm in<br/>
diameter; MRI may fail to reveal smaller lesions. Small ones may be obscured by<br/>
haemorrhage; even at autopsy, a careful search under the dissecting microscope<br/>
may be necessary to find them.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Treatment</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">The<br/>
preferred approach in most centers is surgical excision. Some 20 to 40 percent<br/>
of AVMs are amenable to block dissection, with an operative mortality rate of 2<br/>
to 5 percent and a morbidity of 5 to 25 percent. In the others, which are<br/>
inaccessible, attempts have been made to obliterate the malformed vessels by<br/>
ligation of feeding arteries or by the use of endovascular remobilization with<br/>
liquid adhesives or particular material that are injected via a balloon<br/>
catheter that has been navigated into a feeding vessel. Complete obliteration<br/>
of large AVMs is usually not possible by these methods but, they are highly<br/>
effective in reducing the size of the AVM prior to surgery. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Kjellberg and Chapman (1983) pioneered the treatment<br/>
of AVMs at the Massachusetts General Hospital using a single dose<br/>
subnecrotizing stereotactically directed proton radiation. The technique of<br/>
radiosurgery has been adopted by others using photon radiation sources, such as<br/>
a linear accelerator, gamma knife, and other modes of focused x-ray radiation,<br/>
as an accepted alternative to operative treatment of lesions situated in deep<br/>
regions, including the brainstem, or in ‘eloquent’, areas of the cortex.<br/>
Generally, malformations smaller than 3 cm diameter are treatable in this way.<br/>
Radiosurgical obliteration of AVM occurs in a delayed manner, usually with a<br/>
latency of at least 18 to 24 months after treatment. During this early period<br/>
the patient is unprotected from rebleeding.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">The<br/>
likelihood of successful treatment and the nature of the risks depend on the<br/>
location and size of the AVM and the radiation dose delivered. After 2 years,<br/>
75 to 80 percent of AVMs smaller than 2.5 cm in diameter have been obliterated.<br/>
Even for those AVMs that have not been totally eliminated, the radiation effect<br/>
appears to confer some long-term protection from bleeding. Of the larger ones, majorities<br/>
are shrunken or appear less dense. The rest have shown no change at this low<br/>
dose level, but even in this group, the morbidity and mortality are lower than<br/>
in the untreated group. However, a proportion of larger AVMs that are<br/>
obliterated will recanalize, and many of these will subsequently bleed. Among<br/>
more than 250 patients whose AVMs disappeared following proton beam therapy,<br/>
there has been no recurrence of hemorrhage for up to 10 years; in larger AVMs<br/>
(approximately the last 1000 cases) treated in this way, the frequency and<br/>
severity of hemorrhage have been significantly reduced. The results of<br/>
treatment with focused gamma radiation have been about the same. In one study,<br/>
the risk of hemorrhage was reduced by 54 percent between the time of radiation<br/>
and obliteration of the malformation and by 88 percent thereafter (Maruyama et<br/>
al 2005).</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Two<br/>
types of complications of radiation occur at a combined rate of approximately 2<br/>
to 4 percent. The first is delayed radiation necrosis, which is predictable<br/>
based on the radiation dose, and the second is a venous congestion that occurs<br/>
several weeks or months after treatment. The latter is indicative of the<br/>
desired effect of thrombosis of the malformation. Both cause local symptoms for<br/>
weeks or months. Radiation necrosis may be reduced by the administration of<br/>
corticosteroids but the vascular problem generally is not helped.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">The<br/>
treatment of AVMs by endovascular techniques is increasingly popular but has<br/>
not been fully evaluated. Nearly every AVM has several feeding arteries, some<br/>
not reachable by catheter and some part of the AVM remains after treatment. In<br/>
most series, 25 percent</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">or<br/>
more of AVMs, mostly of small and medium size, could be completely obliterated,<br/>
with a mortality rate below 3 percent and morbidity of 5 to 7 percent, which<br/>
compares favorably with surgical outcomes. These techniques are also<br/>
particularly well adapted to lesions of a combined AVM and an aneurysm on the<br/>
feeding vessel.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Most<br/>
recently, combined therapy that begins with endovascular reduction of the<br/>
lesion and is followed by either surgery or radiation has been viewed most<br/>
favorably. In series of patients using this approach, over 90 percent of<br/>
lesions could be obliterated with a very low rebleeding rate over several<br/>
years. What is clear is that the plan for each patient must be individualized<br/>
based on the size, location, nature of feeding vessels, the presence of other<br/>
vascular lesions (aneurysm or additional AVM), and the age of the patient. Even<br/>
then, there will be differences of opinion based on local resources and<br/>
experience.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Finally,<br/>
if the primary problem is recurrent seizure successful treatment with reduction<br/>
or cessation of seizures is achieved in a very high proportion of cases. The<br/>
results are comparable to those from surgery and radiation, even if the AVM is<br/>
not entirely obliterated.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">These<br/>
curious vascular abnormalities, occurring in both the cranial and spinal dura,<br/>
have different presentations at each site. The cranial type is being detected<br/>
with increasing frequency as refinements continue to be made in imaging of the<br/>
cerebral vessels, but its true incidence and pathogenesis are not fully known.<br/>
The defining features are radiologic -a nidus of abnormal arteries and veins<br/>
with arteriovenous shunting contained entirely within the leaflets of the dura.<br/>
The lesion is fed by dural arterial vessels derived from the internal cranial<br/>
circulation and often more prolifically, from the external cranial circulation<br/>
(external carotid artery and muscular branches of the vertebral artery). The<br/>
venous drainage is complex and is largely into the dural venous sinuses. The<br/>
rapid transit of injected angiographic dye through these fistulas account, for<br/>
the early opacification of the draining venous structures; in the case of<br/>
high-flow connections, this may not be seen unless images are taken almost<br/>
immediately after the injection. A number of potential feeding vessels must be<br/>
injected to demonstrate all the conduits into the lesion. On CT scanning and<br/>
MRI, the fistula is sometimes detected as a thickening or enhancement of a<br/>
region of dura, generally close to a large dural venous sinus. In other cases,<br/>
the dilated draining vessels may be seen only with the injection of dye or<br/>
gadolinium. Probably, many are not detected by these techniques.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt""></span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">The<br/>
origin of these vascular lesions has not been settled- several mechanisms may<br/>
be involved. Most evidence suggests that some of these lesions, unlike<br/>
conventional cerebral AVMs and aneurysms, are not developmental in origin. The<br/>
best-defined examples are those that arise adjacent to a venous sinus<br/>
thrombosis or in association with a vascular atresia, most often in the<br/>
transverse sigmoid sinus or adjacent to the cavernous sinus. However, it is not<br/>
clear whether the abnormality of the dural sinus is the cause or the result of<br/>
the dural fistula. In a number of cases, a dural fistula has appeared after a<br/>
forceful head injury, often in a region remote from the site of impact. A small<br/>
group is associated with the Klippel-Trenaunay or Osler-Weber-Rendu syndromes,<br/>
diseases in which frequent conjunction with AVMs is well known. Usually all of<br/>
these causes can be excluded and the largest group remains idiopathic.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""Subdural hemorrhage is an infrequent mode of
presentation, sometimes creating a large and fatal clot; another syndrome is a
cerebral-subarachnoid hemorrhage, although this occurs with not nearly the
frequency or severity as bleeding from brain AVMs. However, our knowledge of
the risk of bleeding from dural fistulas and the evolution of the lesions is
far less precise than it is for cerebral AVMs. It appears that the dural
lesions most at risk of bleeding are those located in the anterior cranial
fossa and at the tentorial incisura. Seizures are distinctly uncommon. A
special syndrome linked to dural AVMs, although it may occur also with
high-flow cerebral malformations, is of headache, vomiting, and papilledema -namely,
pseudotumor cerebri. A cranial bruit is infrequent. In small children the
high-flow lesions may shunt so much blood as to cause congestive heart failure,
similar to malformations of the vein of Galen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="" text-align:justify=""""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Treatment<br/>
is by surgical extirpation or endovascular embolization, a painstaking<br/>
procedure because of the multitude of potential feeding vessels. Surgery seems<br/>
preferable for the smaller lesions and embolization for larger and inaccessible<br/>
ones. The issue of anticoagulation, when there is slowed flow in a venous sinus<br/>
draining a malformation, is unsettled.</span></span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Cavernous Malformafions</span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Vascular<br/>
malformations composed mainly of clusters of thin walled veins without<br/>
important arterial feeders and with little or no intervening nervous tissue<br/>
make up a significant group, some 7 to 8 percent of our series of AVMs.<br/>
Conventional subdivisions of this group into cavernous, venous, and<br/>
telangiectatic types have not proven useful. We have, therefore, roughly<br/>
designated them all as cavernous. They have several attributes that set them<br/>
apart. Their tendency to bleed is probably no less than that of the more common<br/>
AVMs, but far more often the haemorrhages are small and clinically silent. The<br/>
exact incidence of bleeding is uncertain but is estimated to be less than 1<br/>
percent per year per lesion. Often there are multiple lesions. They are<br/>
generally not seen in arteriograms. The diagnosis is based on their clinical<br/>
manifestations and MRI, which discloses a cluster of vessels surround by a zone<br/>
of hypodense feritin in the T1- weight images, the product of previous small<br/>
episodes of bleeding. A small but uncertain number are associated with adjacent<br/>
venous malformations, visualized by imaging studies. The lack of formation of a<br/>
mass over long period of time separates this lesion from a malignant tumor that<br/>
has bled. About one-half of all cavernous angiomas lie in the brainstem, and in<br/>
the past (before the availability of MRI), many of them were misdiagnosed as<br/>
multiple sclerosis because of a stepwise accumulation of neurologic deficits<br/>
with each haemorrhage. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">About<br/>
10 percent of these lesions are multiple and 5 percent are familiar. In one of<br/>
the families we have followed of Italian-American origin, there were 29<br/>
affected members in there generations. The inheritance followed an autosomal<br/>
dominant pattern; Marchuk and coworkers (1995) have localized the abnormal gene<br/>
in other kindreds to the long arm of chromosome 7. One interesting<br/>
characteristic of this group, as pointed out by Labauge and colleagues (2001),<br/>
is the appearance over time of new lesions in one- third of patients. The<br/>
follow- up of some of our patients has documented this.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><b><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Treatment </span></b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Cavernous<br/>
angiomas on the surface of the brain, within reach of the neurosurgeon, even<br/>
those in the brainstem, can be plucked out, like clusters of grapes, with low<br/>
morbidity and mortality. Kjellberg and colleagues (1983) have treated 89 deeply<br/>
situated cavernous angiomas with low-dose proton radiation. Our impression is<br/>
that these vascular malformations, like the hemangioblastoma, respond poorly to<br/>
radiation and are not amenable to treatment by endovascular techniques.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt"">Lesions<br/>
that cause recurrent bleeding and are surgically accessible with little risk<br/>
are often removed, but incidentally discovered angiomas and those that are<br/>
inaccessible may be left alone. Although this is the approach usually taken,<br/>

progress is being made in the management of SAH. Medical and surgical therapies<br/>

Several promising therapies are being tested; one or more of these<br/>
interventions likely will be shown to further improve outcomes after SAH.<br/>
However, most successful therapies are based on early treatment. Thus, the<br/>
medical community must give greater attention to the early diagnosis of SAH and<br/>
the acute care of patients with SAH who are critically ill.    </span></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Background of the report:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Supply chain management, is the management of a network of interconnected <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"" title=""Business"">businesses</a> involved in the ultimate provision of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"" title=""Product (business)"">product</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_(economics)"" title=""Service (economics)"">service</a> packages required by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=End_customers&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"" title=""End customers (page does not exist)"">end customers</a> .Supply Chain Management spans all movement and storage of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material"" title=""Raw material"">raw materials</a>, work-in-process inventory, and finished goods from point of origin planning, execution, control, and monitoring of supply chain activities with the objective of creating net value, building a competitive infrastructure, leveraging worldwide logistics, synchronizing supply with demand, and measuring performance globally.” So the procedures and standards of teaching are upgraded by different universities and institution in our country.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Rationality:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The study will help formulate suitable policies taking into consideration different ideas, suggestions and feelings of the customers and bankers. Furthermore, it may note that executives who are really executing the policies undertaken by the top management will have a chance to communicate their interaction and provide necessary feedback.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Objectives: </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Objectives regarding this study are as follows:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">General: To study the practice of Supply Chain Management of Ranks Information Technology &amp; Telecommunication Limited.</p>

</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Scope: </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The duration of the study was a very short span of time. It was three month long internship program (June 2011 to August 2011). It was very much hard to complete a report as well as assigned tasks by the Ranks ITT. So I had to complete this study facing very much time presser.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This report covers only Supply Chain management of Ranks Information Technology &amp; Telecommunications Limited.Especially this report emphasizes on the national IT Company and over all problems and function. It considers all IT Companies and their problems and their lack age.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Methodology:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We know there are two source of collecting data. Such as</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Collect Information from Employee and Management.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">2. Secondary Source</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Collect Information from Ranks Information Technology &amp; Telecommunications Limited Official Record and Company web site.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Limitations:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The major limitations of this study are:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">* Lack of sufficient record of company.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">* Lack of time frame.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">* Lack of knowledge about supply chain management</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Chapter – THREE</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Definitions of Supply Chain:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A supply chain is a system of organizations, people, technology, activities, information and resources involved in moving a product or service from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_(supply_chain)"" title=""Vendor (supply chain)"">supplier</a> to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer"" title=""Customer"">customer</a>. Supply chain activities transform natural resources, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material"" title=""Raw material"">raw materials</a> and components into a finished product that is delivered to the end customer. In sophisticated supply chain systems, used products may re-enter the supply chain at any point where residual value is recyclable.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A typical supply chain begins with ecological and biological regulation of natural resources, followed by the human extraction of raw material, and includes several production links (e.g., component construction, assembly, and merging) before moving on to several layers of storage facilities of ever-decreasing size and ever more remote geographical locations, and finally reaching the consumer.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Many of the exchanges encountered in the supply chain will therefore be between different companies that will seek to maximize their revenue within their sphere of interest, but may have little or no knowledge or interest in the remaining players in the supply chain. More recently, the loosely coupled, self-organizing network of businesses that cooperates to provide product and service offerings has been called the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Enterprise"" title=""Extended Enterprise"">Extended Enterprise</a>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Marketing Logistics and Supply Chain Management</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In today’s global marketplace, selling a product is sometimes easier than getting it to cus­tomers. Companies must decide on the best way to store, handle, and move their products and services so that they are available to customers in the right assortments, at the right time, and in the right place. Physical distribution and logistics effectiveness has a major impact on both customer satisfaction and company costs. Here we consider the nature and importance of logistics management in the supply chain, goals of the logistics system, major logistics functions, and the need for integrated supply chain management.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Nature and Importance of Marketing Logistics</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">‘To some managers, marketing logistics means only trucks and warehouses. But modern logis­tics are much more than this. Marketing logistics—also called physical distribution—involves planning, implementing, and controlling the physical flow of goods, services, and related information from points of origin to points of consumption to meet customer requirements at ,a profit. In short, it involves getting the right product to the right customer in the right place at the right time.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In the past, physical distribution typically started with products at the plant and then tried to fire low-cost salutations to get them to customers. However, today’s marketers prefer customer-centered logistics thinking, which starts with the marketplace and works backward to the factory, or even to sources of supply. Marketing logistics involves not only outbound distribution (moving products from the factory to resellers and ultimately customers) but also inbound distribution (moving products and materials from suppliers to the factory) and reverse distribution (moving broken, unwanted, or excess products returned by consumers or resellers). That is, it involves entire supply chain management—managing upstream and downstream value-added flows of materials, final goods, and related information among sup­pliers, the company, resellers, and final consumers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The logistics manager’s task is to coordinate activities of suppliers, purchasing agents, marketers, channel members, and customers. These activities include forecasting, informa­tion systems, purchasing, production planning, order processing, inventory, warehousing, and transportation planning.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Companies today are placing greater emphasis on logistics for several reasons. First, companies can gain a powerful competitive advantage by using improved logistics to give customers better service or lower prices. Second, improved logistics can yield tremendous cost savings to both the company and its customers. As much as 20 percent of an average product’s price is accounted for by shipping and transport alone. This far exceeds the cost of advertising and many other marketing costs. Last year, American companies spent almost $1.2 trillion—about 9.6 percent of gross domestic product—to wrap, bundle, load, unload, sort, reload, and transport goods. By itself, Ford has more than 500 million tons of finished vehicles, production parts, and aftermarket parts in transit at any given time, running up an annual logistics bill of around $4 billion.<sup>12 </sup>Shaving off even a small fraction of these costs can mean substantial savings.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Third, the explosion in product variety has created a need for improved logistics manage­ment. For example, in 1911 the typical A&amp;P grocery store carried only 270 items. The store manager could keep track of this inventory on about 10 pages of notebook paper stuffed in a shirt pocket. Today, the average A&amp;P carries a bewildering stock of more than 25,000 items. A Wal-Mart Super center store carries more than 100,000 products, 30,000 of which are grocery products.Ordering, shipping, stocking, and controlling such a variety of products present a sizable logistics challenge.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Finally, improvements in information tech­nology have created opportunities for major gains in distribution efficiency. Today’s compeer flies are using sophisticated supply chain man­agement software, Web-based logistics systems, point-of-sale scanners, uniform product codes, satellite tracking, and electronic transfer of order and payment data. Such technologies let them quickly and efficiently manage the flow of goods, information, and finances through the supply chain.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Goals of the Logistics System</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Some companies state their logistics objective as providing maximum customer service at the least cost. Unfortunately, no logistics system can both maximize customer service and mini­mize distribution costs. Maximum customer service implies rapid delivery, large inventories, flexible assortments, liberal returns policies, and other services—all of which raise distribu­tion costs. Contrast, minimum distribution costs imply slower delivery, smaller invento­ries, and larger shipping lots—which represent a lower level of overall customer service.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The goal of marketing logistics should be to provide a targeted level of customer service at the least cost. A company must first research the importance of various distribution ser­vices to customers and then set desired service levels for each segment. The objective is to maximize profits, not sales. Therefore, the company must weigh the benefits of providing higher levels of service against the costs. Some companies offer less service than their com­petitors and charge a lower price. Other companies offer more service and charge higher prices to cover higher costs.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Major Logistics Functions</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Given a set of logistics objectives, the company is ready to design a logistics system that will minimize the cost of attaining these objectives. The major logistics functions include warehousing, inventory management, transportation, and logistics information management.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Warehousing</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Production and consumption cycles rarely match. So most companies must store their tangi­ble goods while they wait to be sold. For example, Snapper, Toro, and other lawn mower man­ufacturers run their factories all year long and store up products for the heavy spring and summer buying seasons. The storage function overcomes differences in needed quantities and timing, ensuring that products are available when customers are ready to buy them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A company must decide on how many and what types of warehouses it needs and where they will be located. The company might use either scrooge warehouses or distribution cen­ters. Storage warehouses store goods. for moderate to lo ~g periods. Distribution centers are designed to move goods rather than just store them. They are large and highly automated warehouses designed to receive goods from various plants and suppliers, take orders, fill them efficiently, and deliver goods to customers as quickly as possible.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For example, Wal-Mart operates a network of more than 100 huge U.S. distribution centers and another 57 around the globe. A single center, which might serve the daily needs of 120 Wal-Mart stores, typically contains some 1.2 million square feet of space (about 29 football fields) under a ~single roof. One huge center near Williamsburg, Virginia, contains more than 3 million square feet. At a typical center, laser scanners route as many as 190,000 cases of goods per day along 11 miles of conveyer belts, and the center’s 1,000 workers load or unload some 500 trucks daily. Wal-Mart’s Monroe, Georgia, distribution center contains a 127,000-square-foot freezer that can hold 10,000 pallets—room enough for 58 million Popsicles. Like almost everything else these days, warehousing has seen dramatic changes in technology in recent years. Older, multistory­ need warehouses with outdated materials-handling methods are steadily being replaced by newer, single-storied automated ware­ houses with advanced, computer-controlled materials-handling systems requiring few employees. Computers and scanners read orders and direct lift trucks, electric hoists, or robots to gather goods, move them to loading docks, and issue invoices.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Inventory Management</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Inventory management also affects customer satisfaction. Here, managers must maintain the delicate balance between carrying too little inventory and carrying too much. With too little stock, the firm risks not having products when customers want to buy. To remedy this, the firm may need costly emergency shipments or production. Carrying too much inventory results in higher-than-necessary inventory-carrying costs and stock obsolescence. Thus, in managing inventory, firms must balance the costs of carrying larger inventories against resulting sales and profits. Many companies have greatly reduced their inventories and related costs through just-in-time logistics systems. With such sys­tems, producers and retailers carry only small inventories of parts or merchandise, often only enough for a few days of operations. For example, Dell, a master just-in-time producer, carries just 2 to 3 days of inventory, whereas competitors might carry 40 days of even 60.15 new stocks arrives exactly when needed, rather than being stored in inventory until being used. Just-in-time systems require accurate forecasting along with fast, frequent, and flexible delivery so that new supplies will be available when needed. However, these systems result in substantial savings in inventory carrying and handling costs.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Marketers are always looking for new ways to make inventory management more efficient. In the not-too-clashing future, handling inventory might even become fully automated. For example, in Chapter 3, we discussed RFID or “smart tag” technology, by which. Small transmitter chips are embedded in or placed on products and packaging on everything from flowers and razors to tires. “Smart” products could make the entire supply chain—which accounts for nearly 75 percent of a product’s cost—intelligent aria automated. Companies using RFID would know, at any time, exactly where a product is located physically within the supply chain. “Smart shelves” would not only tell them when it’s time to reorder, but would also place the order automatically with their suppliers. Such exciting new information technology applications will revolutionize distribution as we know it. Many large and resourceful marketing companies, such as Procter &amp; Gamble, IBM, Wal-Mart, Levi Strauss, and Best Buy, are investing heavily to make the full use of RFID technology a reality.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Transportation</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The choice of transportation carriers affects the pricing of products, delivery performance, and condition of the goods when they arrive—all of which will affect customer satisfaction. In shipping goods to its warehouses, dealers, and customers, the company can choose among five main transportation modes: truck, rail, and water, pipeline, and air, along with an alternative mode for digital products—the Internet. Trucks have increased their share of transportation steadily and now account for nearly 35 percent of total cargo ton-miles (more than 60 percent of actual tonnageEach year in the United States, trucks travel more has 216 billion miles—a distance that has more than dou­bled over the past 20 years—carrying 11 billion tons of freight worth over $9 trillion. Trucks are highly flexible in their routing and time sched­ules and they can usually offer faster service than railroads. They are efficient for short hauls of high-value merchandise. Trucking firms have added many services in recent years. For exam­ple, Roadway Express now offers everything from satellite tracking and 24-hour shipment informa­tion to logistics planning software and “border ambassadors” who expedite cross-border ship­ping operations. Railroads account for 31 percent of total cargo ton-miles moved. They are one of the most cost-effective modes for shipping large amounts of bulk products—coal, sand, minerals, and farm and forest products—over long distances. In recent years, railroads have increased their cus­tomer services by designing new equipment to handle special categories of goods, providing flat-cars for carrying truck trailers by rail (piggyback), and providing in-transit services such as the diversion of shipped goods to other destinations en route and the processing of goods en route.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Water carriers, which account for about 11 percent of cargo ton-miles, transport large amounts of goods by ships and barges on U.S. coastal and inland waterways. Although the cost of water transportation is very low for shipping bulky, low-value, nonperishable products such as sand, coal, grain, oil, and metallic ores, water transportation is the slowest mode and may be affected by the weather. Pipelines, which also account for about 16 crescents of cargo ton-miles, are a specialized means of shipping petroleum, natural gas, and chemicals from sources to markets. Most pipelines are used by their owners to ship their own products. Although air carriers transport less than 5 per­cent of the nation’s goods, they are an important transportation mode. Airfreight rates are much higher than rail or truck rates but airfreight is ideal when speed is needed or distant markets must be reached. Among the most frequently air-freighted products are perishables (fresh fish, cut flowers) and high-value, low-bulk items (tech­nical instruments, jewelry). Companies find that airfreight also reduces inventory levels, packag­ing costs, and the number of warehouses needed. The Internet carries digital products from producer to customer via satellite, cable modem, or telephone wire. Software firms, the media, music companies, and education all make use of the Internet to transport digital products. Although these firms primarily use tra­ditional transportation to distribute CDs, newspapers, and more, the Internet holds the poten­tial for lower product distribution costs. Whereas planes, trucks, and trains move freight and packages, digital technology moves information bits. Shippers also use interposal transportation—combining two or more modes of trans­portation. Piggyback describes the use of rail and trucks; fishy back, water and trucks; train ship, water and rail; and air truck, air and trucks. Combining modes provides advan­tages that no single mode can deliver. Each combination offers advantages to the shipper. For example, not only is piggyback cheaper than trucking alone but it also provides flexibility and convenience. In choosing a transportation mode for a product, shippers must balance many considera­tions: speed, dependability, availability, cost, and others. Thus, if a shipper needs speed, air and truck are the prime choices. If the goal is low cost, then water or pipeline might be best.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Logistics Information Management</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Companies manage their supply chains through information. Channel partners often link up to share information and to make better joint logistics decisions. From a logistics perspective, information flows such as customer orders, billing, inventory levels, and even customer data are closely linked to channel performance. The company wants to design a simple, accessible, fast, and accurate process for capturing, processing, and sharing channel information. Information can be shared and managed in many ways—by mail or telephone, through salespeople, or through traditional or Internet-based electronic data interchange (EDD, the computerized exchange of data between organizations. Wal-Mart, for example, maintains ElM links with almost all of its 91,000 suppliers. And where it once took eight weeks, using El)], Krispy Kreme can now turn around 1,000 supplier invoices and process the checks in only i single week.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In some cases, suppliers might actually be asked to generate orders and arrange deliveries for their customers. Many largo retailers—such as Wal-Mart and Home Depot—work closely with major suppliers such as Procter &amp; Gamble or Black &amp; Decker to set up vendor-manage I inventory (VMI) systems or continuous inventory rape enrichment systems. Using VMI, the cus­tomer shares real-time data on sales and current inventory levels with the supplier. The sup­plier then takes full responsibility for managing inventories and deliveries. Some retailers even go so far as to shift inventory and delivery costs to the supplier. Such systems require close cooperation between the buyer and seller.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Integrated Logistics Management</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Today, more and more companies are adopting the concept of integrated logistics management. This concept recognizes that providing better customer service and trimming distribution costs require teamwork, both inside the company and among all the marketing channel orga­nizations. Inside, the company’s various departments must work closely together to maximize the company’s own logistics performance. Outside, the company must integrate its logistics system with those of its<sub>1</sub>suppliers and customers to maximize the performance of the entire distribution system.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Cross-Functional Teamwork inside the Company</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In most companies, responsibility for various logistics activities is assigned to many different departments—marketing, sales, finance, operations, purchasing. Too often, each function tries to optimize its own logistics performance without regard for the activities of the other functions. However, Transported, inventory, warehousing, and order-processing activities interact, often in an inverse way. Lower inventory levels reduce inventory-carrying costs. But they may also reduce customer service and increase costs from stockpots, back orders, special production runs, and costly fast-freight shipments. Because distribution activities involve strong trade-offs, decisions by different functions must be coordinated to achieve better over­all logistics performance. The goal of integrated supply chain management is to harmonize all of the company’s logistics decisions. Close working relationships among departments can be achieved in sev­eral ways. Some companies have created permanent logistics committees, made up of man­agers responsible for different physical distribution activities. Companies can also create sup­ply chain manager positions that link the logistics activities of functional areas. For example, Procter &amp; Gamble has created supply managers, who manage all of the supply chain activities for each of its product categories. Many companies have a vice president of logistics with cross-functional authority. Finally, companies can employ sophisticated, system wide supply chain management software, now available from wide range of software enterprises large and small, from SAP to River One and Logility.<sup>19 </sup>The important thing is that the company must coordinate its logistics and marketing activities to create high market satisfaction at a reason­able cost.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Building Logistics Partnerships</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Companies must do more than improve their own logistics. They must also work with other channel partners to improve whole-channel distribution. The members of a marketing chan­nel are linked closely in creating customer value and building customer relationships. One company’s distribution system is another company’s supply system. The success of each channel member depends on the performance of the entire supply chain. For example, IKEA can create its stylish but affordable furniture and deliver the “IKEA lifestyle” only if its entire supply chain—consisting of thousands of merchandise designers and suppliers, trans­port companies, warehouses, and service providers—operates at maximum efficiency and Smart companies coordinate their logistics strategies and forge strong partnerships with sup­pliers and customers to improve customer service and reduce channel costs. Many companies have created cross-functional, cross-company teams. For example, Procter &amp; Gamble has a team of more than 200 people working in Bentonville, Arkansas, home of Wal-Mart.<sup>2</sup>° The P&amp;G are work jointly with their counterparts at Wal-Mart to find ways to squeeze costs out of their distribution system. Working together benefits not only P&amp;G and Wal-Mart but also their shared final consumers. Other companies partner through shared pro­jects. For example, many large retailers are work­ing closely with suppliers on in-store programs. Home Depot allows key suppliers to use its stores as a testing ground for new merchandising pro­grams. The suppliers spend time at 1-lome Depot stores watching how their product sells -and how customers relate to it. They then create programs specially tailored to Home Depot and its cus­tomers. Clearly, both the supplier and the customer benefit from such partnerships. The point is that all supply chain members must work together in the cause of bringing value to final consumers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Third-Party Logistics </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Most big companies love to make and sell their products. But many loathe the associated logistics “grunt work.” They detest the bundling, loading, unloading, sorting, storing, reloading, transporting, customs clearing, and tracking required to supply their factories and to gut products out to customer They hate it so much. g numb of firms now outsource some or all us their 1ogisac third-party logistics (3PL) providers. These “3PLs”—companies such as UPS Supply Chain Solutions, Penske Logistics, BAX Global, Ryder System, FedEx Logistics, or Roadway Logistics Services-.—-help clients to tighten up sluggish, overstuffed supply chains, slash inventories, and get products to customers more quickly and reliably. For example, UPS’s Supply Chain Services unit provides clients with a wide range of logistics services, from inventory control, warehousing, and transportation management to customer service and fulfillment, According to a recent survey of chief logistics executives at Fortune 500 companies, 82 percent of these companies use third-party logistics (also called 3PL, outsourced logistics, or contract logistics) services. In just the past ten years, the 3PL market has tripled in size to more than $100 billion.<sup>21</sup></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Companies use third-party logistics providers for several reasons. First, because getting the product to market is their main focus, these providers can often do it more efficiently and at lower cost. Outsourcing typically results in 15 percent to 30 percent cost savings. Second, outsourcing logistics frees a company to focus more intensely on its core business. Finally, integrated logistics companies understand increasingly complex logistics environments. This can be especially helpful to companies attempting to expand their global market coverage. For example, companies distributing their products across Europe face a bewildering array of environmental restrictions that affect logistics, including packaging standards, truck size and weight limits, and noise and emissions pollution controls. By outsourcing its logistics, a com­pany can gain a complete pan-European distribution system without incurring the costs, delays, and risks associated with setting up its own system.</p>

17,"<h2 class=""blog_entry-title"">THE CONCEPT OF DOWER UNDER MUSLIM LAW</h2>","<div class=""entry-content"">
<div class=""featured-thumb"">
<a href=""#"">

</div>
<div class=""entry-content"">
<p><span class="""">Article shared by ISHAD SAYED</span></p>
<section class=""entry"">The Islamic concept of dower is that it is that money or property which a husband must pay to the wife to acknowledge her dignity as his wife. Dower is neither a consideration (bride-price) in the marriage-contract nor a gift to the wife to allow intercourse with her.Hedaya provides that, “the payment of dower is enjoined by the law, merely as a token of respect for its object (the woman), wherefore the mention of it is not absolutely essential to the validity of a marriage, and for the same reason, a marriage is also valid although the man were to engage in the contract on the special condition that there should be no dower.” In other words, under Muslim law, there cannot be any marriage without dower.
<div class=""code-block code-block-2"">
<p>ADVERTISEMENTS:</p>
</div>
<p>In a marriage, the husband must pay ‘something’ to the wife as a mark of respect towards her whether this liability has been expressly referred to at the time of marriage or not. If there is an agreement between husband and wife that wife would not claim her dower, the agreement is void and the wife’s right to dower exists despite such an agreement.</p>
<p>According to Mulla dower is consideration of the marriage contract. The Calcutta High Court has also observed that Muslim-marriage is like a contract of sale in which the wife is the property and dower is the price for this property.</p>
<p>These opinions are based on the argument that’ a Muslim marriage being a civil contract, there must be some consideration in this contract; dower fulfils the requirement of consideration. But, it is respectfully submitted that it is wrong to regard dower as consideration of the marriage- contract because, even where no dower has been specified, the marriage-contract is not affected the least. Even in such cases, some dower (proffer dower) is made payable to the wife by operation of law. Explaining the concept of dower, Abdur Rahim correctly observes:</p>
<p>“It is not a consideration proceeding from the husband for the contract of marriage, but is an obligation imposed by the law on the husband as a mark of respect for the wife as is evident from the fact that the non-specification of dower at the time of marriage does not affect the validity of the marriage.”</p>
<div class=""code-block code-block-5"">
<p>ADVERTISEMENTS:</p>
</div>
<p>It is, therefore, clear that essentially, the dower is the fundamental feature of a Muslim-marriage because it is to be given by husband to his wife as a token of respect towards her.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>1.1. Introduction:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The climate is changing. The earth is warming up, and there is now overwhelming scientific consensus that it is happening, and human-induced. With global warming on the increase and species and their habitats on the decrease, chances for ecosystems to adapt naturally are diminishing.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Many are agreed that climate change may be one of the greatest threats facing the planet. Recent years show increasing temperatures in various regions, and/or increasing extremities in weather patterns.</p>

Climate change may occur in a specific <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"" title=""Region"">region</a>, or across the whole <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth"" title=""Earth"">Earth</a>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In recent usage, especially in the context of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_policy"" title=""Environmental policy"">environmental policy</a>, climate change usually refers to changes in modern <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate"" title=""Climate"">climate</a> (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming"" title=""Global warming"">global warming</a>).

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>1.2. Nature and Scope of the Study:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Research has shown that air pollutants from fossil fuel use make clouds reflect more of the sun’s rays back into space. This leads to an effect known as global dimming whereby less heat and energy reaches the earth. At first, it sounds like an ironic savior to climate change problems. However, it is believed that global dimming caused the droughts in Ethiopia in the 1970s and 80s where millions died, because the northern hemisphere oceans were not warm enough to allow rain formation. Global dimming is also hiding the true power of global warming. By cleaning up global dimming-causing pollutants without tackling greenhouse gas emissions, rapid warming has been observed, and various human health and ecological disasters have resulted, as witnessed during the European heat wave in 2003, which saw thousands of people die.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The world mostly agrees that something needs to be done about global warming and climate change. The first stumbling block, however, has been trying to get an agreement on a framework. In 1988, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was created by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meterological Organization (WMO) to assess the scientific knowledge on global warming. The IPCC concluded in 1990 that there was broad international consensus that climate change was human-induced. That report led way to an international convention for climate change, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), signed by over 150 countries at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. This section looks at this Convention and some of the main principles in it.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>1.3. Objective of the Study:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A change has already affected some small island nations. Climate justice, equity and sustainable development are all important parts of this debate that are often left out of mainstream discourse. Equal rights to the atmosphere for all human beings and equity within and between nations are paramount.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">An agreed principle was that of common but different responsibilities.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">That is, when the world’s majority countries signed up to climate change Convention (including countries like the US who would later withdraw from the subsequent Kyoto Protocol) it was agreed that it is today’s rich nations who are the ones responsible for global warming as greenhouse gases tend to remain in the atmosphere for many decades, and rich countries have been industrializing and emitting climate changing pollution for many more centuries than the poor countries.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It was also agreed that the poor countries had pressing needs to meet basic needs and eradicate poverty. As a result, it was agreed that it would be unfair to put emissions restrictions on poor countries when it is the rich countries who have caused the problems growing concern from developing countries and various NGOs is the need for public participation and the effect on populations and poor countries that global warming negotiations have. The impacts of climate change will be felt on the world’s poorest countries the most.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Flexibility mechanisms were defined in the Kyoto Protocol as different ways to achieve emissions reduction as part of the effort to address climate change issues. These fall into the following categories: Emissions Trading, Joint Implementation and Clean Development Mechanism. However, these have been highly controversial as they were mainly included on strong US insistence and to keep the US in the treaty. Some of the mechanisms face criticism for not actually leading to a reduction in emissions, for example.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>CHAPTER-II</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Global Warming</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.1 Definition of Global Warming:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Global Warming is defined as the increase of the average temperature on Earth. As the Earth is getting hotter, disasters like hurricanes, droughts and floods are getting more frequent.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Global warming is the increase in the average temperature of the Earth’s near-surface air and oceans, and its projected continuation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Global warming is potential increase in average global atmospheric temperatures resulting from the greenhouse effect.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Global warming is the next big impact that will bring about a change in the weather patterns. By definition, Global Warming is the increase in average temperature that gradually warms the Earth’s atmosphere. It is a phenomenon, which has been on the rise but in the last century, the increase in the levels have been alarming.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The average temperature of the atmosphere has risen by 0.74 – 0.18 °C during the last century. According to the study by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it is observed that the increase in global average temperature has been caused due to an increase in greenhouse gas concentrations. This has led to an unprecedented warming of the Earth’s surface.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The other phenomena’s responsible for global warming include volcanoes and solar variations. Base on some of the models by the IPCC, the prediction is that the global temperature is likely to rise by 1.1 to 6.4 °C between 1990 and 2100. This increase in temperature will cause climatic changes and extreme weather conditions like rising sea level, change in the amount of precipitation, above average rainfall, melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, storms and hurricanes.<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.2. Steps of Global Warming:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Broadly speaking, sunlight solar energy reaches to the earth atmosphere in three forms:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(i) Ultra Violet Radiation;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(ii) Visible light; and</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(iii) Infra-red &amp; radio waves.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">During the day time, visible light and infrared &amp; radio waves come to the earth and some of its hit is absorbed by the earth and the rest goes back into the atmosphere. After entering the atmosphere, part of this hit is absorbed by Carbon dioxide and water vapor present in the atmosphere and the rest its absorbed into the universe. During the night, when, there is no sunlight, Carbon dioxide and water vapor release this hit to the earth. Otherwise the earth would be cooled and the survival of life would be impossible.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Carbon dioxide and water vapor, thus, balances the temperature. However, due to relatively recent increase, of the concentration of CO2, CFCs, methane (CK4), nitrous oxide (N2O), the temperature is rising gradually and hitting ozone layer. As a result, ozone hole that is noted cause Ultra violet rays to reach directly to the earth, and global warming. Thus, global warming is the result of green house effect.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">1. Visible light and infra-red rays pass through the CO2 into the lower region of the atmosphere.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">2. Incoming energy is converted to heat</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">3. Longer, infra-red wavelengths hit green-house gas molecules in the atmosphere</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">4. Greenhouse gas molecules in the atmosphere emit Infrared radiation back towards earth.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">5. Greenhouse gases being more concentrated into the atmosphere hit the ozone layer and cause ozone hole.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">6. Ultra violet rays hit the earth directly and cause global warming.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.3. Green House Effect:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Greenhouse Gases:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Carbon Dioxide (CO7)</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Source</b>: Fossil fuel burning, deforestation</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Methane (CH4)</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Source:</b> Rice cultivation, cattle &amp; sheep</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">ranching, decay from mining.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b> Nitrous oxide (N7O)</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Source:</b> Industry and agriculture (fertilizers)</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>CFCs:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Source:</b> fridge, refrigerator, air conditioner, aerosol etc. These Greenhouse gases absorb infrared radiation and prevent it from escaping to space.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/kids/greenhouse.html"">greenhouse effect</a> is the rise in temperature that the Earth experiences because certain gases in the <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/kids/greenhouse.html"">atmosphere</a> (water vapor, <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/kids/greenhouse.html"">carbon dioxide</a>, <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/kids/greenhouse.html"">nitrous oxide</a>, and <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/kids/greenhouse.html"">methane</a>, for example) trap energy from the sun. Without these gases, heat would escape back into space and Earth’s average temperature would be about 60<a href=""http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/kids/greenhouse.html"">ºF</a> colder. Because of how they</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Warm our world; these gases are referred to as <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/kids/greenhouse.html"">greenhouse gases</a>. <a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Picture-1</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Most greenhouses look like a small glass house. Greenhouses are used to grow plants, especially in the winter. Greenhouses work by trapping heat from the sun. The glass panels of the greenhouse let in light but keep heat from escaping. This causes the greenhouse to heat up, much like the inside of a car parked in sunlight, and keeps the plants warm enough to live in the winter.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Earth’s atmosphere is all around us. It is the air that we breathe. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere behave much like the glass panes in a greenhouse. Sunlight enters the Earth’s atmosphere, passing through the blanket of greenhouse gases. As it reaches the Earth’s surface, land, water, and <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/kids/greenhouse.html"">biosphere</a> absorb the sunlight’s energy. Once absorbed, this energy is sent back into the atmosphere. Some of the energy passes back into space, but much of it remains trapped in the atmosphere by the greenhouse gases, causing our world to heat up.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Pic-2</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The greenhouse effect is important. Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth would not be warm enough for humans to live. But if the greenhouse effect becomes stronger, it could make the Earth warmer than usual. Even a little extra warming may cause problems for humans, plants, and animals.<a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title="""">[4]</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our atmosphere is but a tiny layer of gas around a huge bulky planet. But it is this gaseous outer ring and its misleadingly called greenhouse effect that makes life on Earth possible and that could destroy life as we know it.</p>

<li>Global warming causes and effects at a glance.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The sun is the Earth’s primary energy source, a burning star so hot that we can feel its heat from over 150 million kilometers away. Its rays enter our atmosphere and shower upon on our planet. About one third of this solar energy is reflected back into the universe by shimmering glaciers, water and other bright surfaces. Two thirds, however, are absorbed by the Earth, warming land, oceans, and atmosphere.<a href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" title="""">[5]</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Much of this heat radiates back out into space, but some of it is stored in the atmosphere. This process is called the greenhouse effect. Without it, the Earth’s average temperature would be a chilling -18 degrees Celsius, even despite the sun’s constant energy supply.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In a world like this, life on Earth would probably have never emerged from the sea. Thanks to the greenhouse effect, however, heat emitted from the Earth is trapped in the atmosphere, providing us with a comfortable average temperature of 14 degrees.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Only about half of all solar energy that reaches the Earth is infrared radiation and causes immediate warming when passing the atmosphere. The other half is of a higher frequency, and only translates into heat once it hits Earth and is later reflected back into space as waves of infrared radiation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This transformation of solar radiation in to infrared radiation is crucial, because infrared radiation can be absorbed by the atmosphere. So, on a cold and clear night, parts of this infrared radiation that would normally dissipate into space get caught up in the Earth’s atmosphere. And like a radiator in the middle of a room, our atmosphere radiates this heat into all directions.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Parts of this heat are finally sent out in the frozen nothingness of space, parts of it are sent back to Earth where they step up global temperatures. Just how much warmer it gets down here depends on how much energy is absorbed up there– and this, in turn, depends on the atmosphere’s composition.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>The switch from carbon dioxide to oxygen:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Nitrogen, oxygen, and argon make up 98 percent of the Earth’s atmosphere. But they do not absorb significant amounts of infrared radiation, and thus do not contribute to the greenhouse effect. It is the more exotic components like water vapour, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, nitrous oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons that absorb heat and thus increase atmospheric temperatures.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Studies indicate that until some 2.7 billion years ago, there was so much carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane in our atmosphere that average temperatures on Earth were as high as 70 degrees. But bacteria and plants slowly turned CO2 into oxygen and the concentration of CO2 in our current atmosphere dropped to just about 0.038 percent or 383 parts per million (ppm), a unit of measurement used for very low concentrations of gases that has become a kind of currency in climate change debates.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">But while we are still far from seeing major concentrations of Carbon di Oxide in our atmosphere, slight changes already alter the way our celestial heating system works. Measurements of carbon dioxide amounts from Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii show that CO2 has increased from about 313 ppm in 1960 to about 375 ppm in 2005.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Global Warming Organizations:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Global warming has become the rising issue as it will effect climatic changes on a global scale and make planet Earth so warm that even humans will not be able to survive the heat. It is like a race against time where some organizations are trying to prolong the effect and fight it in their own way. Some of these organizations are:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A leading national nonprofit organization, it was founded in 1967. Known as EDF, they have 500,000 members. Their mission is to protect the environmental rights of people, which includes the future generations. The rights are aimed at providing healthy food, clean air &amp; water, and thriving ecosystems. There mission is backed by their scientific research and orientation. They promote and apply scientific evaluation of environmental problems to find solutions.<a href=""#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"" title="""">[6]</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">One of the most popular non-profit organizations that has been associated with protecting the plant, eco-systems, and wildlife. They have been protecting the future of nature for more than 45 years now. WWF has branches in 100 countries and is supported by more than 1.2 million members in the US itself, while global count has crossed the 5 million mark. The WWF working process combines reaching out to the global audience with a foundation in science that requires action at every level from rural to cosmopolitan and from local to global.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Some of the other organizations involved in saving the planet, nature, wildlife and mankind include:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">1. Natural Resources Defense Council</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">2. Sierra Club</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">3. Union of Concerned Scientists</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">4. U.S. Public Interest Research Group</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">5. World Resources Institute<a href=""#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7"" title="""">[7]</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b> Cause and Effect of Global Warming</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The causes of global warming are many and effects are far more profound. What we have really witnessed in the last couple of decades is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>CAUSES:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The main underlying cause of Global Warming is greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2). Every tree takes CO2 from the air during its growing process. When a tree dies or the wood decays then CO2 is again returned to the atmosphere. In the last couple of decades tropical forest have borne the brunt of major felling of trees and burning of wood, which has added more CO2 into the atmosphere.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There are many causes of global warming. Most important causes are:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">1) Deforestation</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">2) Industrialization</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">3) Burning of fosil fuels</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">4) Decay of dead organisms <a href=""#_ftn8"" name=""_ftnref8"" title="""">[8]</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">5) Respiration/ breathing of living organisms</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">6} pollution of Automobile</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">7) Thermal power plant</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">8) Cultivation of land</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">9) Eruption t. volcanoes (a mountain with a large circular hole at the top thought which lava, gases, steam and dust are forced out)</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">10) Domestic cooking</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Today deforestation has reached a stage where it cannot be turned back. In 1987, a major chunk of the Amazon forest was burnt and it was of the size of Britain. This released 500 million tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. The lesser the number of trees, the less CO2 will be absorbed.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>EFFECTS:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The effect of global warming will be catastrophic and if you look around you, then you will see some of the signs. If no action is taken now, then it will be too late as the greenhouse effect will slowly increase the average global temperature by 1.5 to 4.50C. This rise in temperature will affect the polar ice caps more than the tropical belt.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Winters will become warmer and the world will be hotter than what it was 100,000 years back. By the end of the next century, the temperatures would have soared very high and it will be tough for humans to survive. The last 15 years have been the ten hottest years since the 1860’s.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.5. Impact of Global Warming:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Environmental scientists inform that if only 3 % global temperature on an average is increased, 40 crore tones of crop-production will be obstructed and 40 crore of population will be hunger of food. However, global warming has the following impacts-</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">1) Melting ice</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">2) Flooding of low lying costal areas</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">3) Sea level change</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">4) Increase in the flow of rivers and change in the rainfall pattern.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">5) Submersion of Islands.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">6) Occurrence of more cyclones and hurricanes.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">7) Damage of agricultural crops.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">8) Water pollution</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">9) Refugee problems</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">10) Deforestation</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">11) Ozone layer depletion</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Global warming has a big impact on the Earth, having both negative and positive effects. Global warming occurs because of an increase in the emission of greenhouse gases. The burning of fossil fuels only adds to these emissions. Temperatures around the globe are slowly warming, and this affects every continent and area on Earth. This is also known as the greenhouse effect. This has become a problem because too much solar radiation is getting trapped in the Earth’s atmosphere, which has caused the Earth to become warmer. Greenhouse gases are responsible for retaining this energy. The more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the more solar radiation become trapped and the warmer the planet gets.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Climate conditions have changed significantly since the Earth was created. The average temperature of the Earth has fluctuated over this time and so has the mix of gases in the atmosphere. Now it seems that recent human activity, such as the burning of fossil fuels reserves, has caused the Earth to heat up even more. Scientists cannot say for sure what the effects of global warming on the Earth will be until they happen, but predictions include faster melting of glaciers and the polar ice caps, an increase in sea levels as a result of the melting, a warmer global temperature, a loss of forest areas, shifts in the location of the animal and plant populations, decreased rainfall and other types of precipitation in some areas, and deserts appearing where lush plant life is now, among others. Tropical storms and hurricanes may become fiercer and the circulation and acidity balance of some oceans may change.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Global warming can have profound effects on the Earth and eliminating or at least minimizing greenhouse gases is needed to stop these effects. Once the process has started, it may take hundreds of years or more for the changes to stop, even with no new greenhouse gases being released. Using renewable alternative energy sources such as biomass energy, is a step in the right direction to help minimize the impact that global warming has on the Earth. Forests and plant life can also play an important role in the future of energy because while living they help to replace carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, with oxygen, and they are also the source behind much of the biomass energy created.<a href=""#_ftn9"" name=""_ftnref9"" title="""">[9]</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Through the first half of the 20th century, when global warming from the greenhouse effect was only a speculation, the handful of scientists who thought about it supposed any warming would be for the good. Svante Arrhenius, who published the first calculations, claimed that nations like his native Sweden “may hope to enjoy ages with more equable and better climates.” Most people assumed that a “balance of nature” made catastrophic consequences impossible, and if any change did result from the “progress” of human .</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Background of Environmental Law</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>3.1 Environmental Law:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">International environmental law is the body of international law that concerns the protection of the global environment.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Originally associated with the principle that states must not permit the use of their territory in such a way as to injure the territory of other states, international environmental law has since been expanded by a plethora of legally-binding international agreements. These encompass a wide variety of issue-areas, from terrestrial, marine and atmospheric pollution through to wildlife and biodiversity protection.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>3.2 History and Development of Environmental Law:</b></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>From early Fisheries convention to the creation of the UN:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Major trends:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• First realization that industrialization and development required limitations on the exploitation of nature resources;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Need for adoption of appropriate legal instruments felt;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Approaches were not global or integral sector based approach was seen;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Focus was given on the conservation of wildlife (birds, fisheries, seals) in formulating environmental rules;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Absence of appropriate technology and scientific evidence;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Adopted treaties (though very few in number) were mostly adhoc, sporadic and scattered and limited in scope.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Treaties were mostly bi-lateral or of limited parties;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Need for international co-operation for the protection of environment (to be more specific regarding some flora and fauna) was felt for the first time during the period.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• No strict obligation provided in the treaties;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• International institutions were started to be established for the purpose of ensuring the implementation of treaties; for example, International Committee (later council) for bird protection, ICBP, 1922;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Role of the individuals, scientists and organization in the development of International Environmental Law during this period.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Major Treaties:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Fisheries Convention between France and UK</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Fisheries Treaty between UK and USA, 1892</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• 1902 Convention for the protection of bird useful to agriculture, generally known as bird convention</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Convention relative to the preservation of Fauna and Flora in their natural State, 1933 commonly known as London Convention.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">International Disputes:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">During the first period of the development of International Environmental Law, two significant environment disputes were submitted to international arbitration; which laid down certain principles that are later on recognized as of great contribution to the development of Environmental Law.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Pacific Fur Seal Arbitration, 1893</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• The Trial Smelter Case, 1937</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>3.3 From the Creation of UN to Stockholm Conference, 1972:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Major Trends:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• A range of International organization with competence in environmental mater created.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• A good number of International legal instruments were adopted.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Another feature of this phase was the limited recognition of the relationship between economic development and the environment protection.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Through the UN Charter did not include provisions on environmental protection or conservation of natural resources the creation various subsidiary organs of UN made the way to establish global environmental principles through its organs and sub-organs. For example, constituent instruments of FAO of UNESCO included provisions with environmental or conservationist aspects an latter they emerged as vital role players in the development of Environmental Law.<a href=""#_ftn11"" name=""_ftnref11"" title="""">[11]</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Major Events:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• In 1948, IUCN (first as IUPN, then IUCN) was established to promote the preservation of wildlife and natural environment, public knowledge, education, scientific research and legislation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• ECOSOC convened the 1949 UN Conference on the Conservation and Utilization of Resources, UNCCUR at the initiative of Former US president Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Trucmail. Though the scope of the conference was limited, UNCCUR Addressed six issues; minerals, fuels and energy, water, forests, land and wildlife &amp;fish.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• In 1945 General Assembly convened a major conference on the conservation of the living resources of the sea which led to the aeddc3option of conservation rules in theddc3 1958 Geneva Convention.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• GA’s attention to the effects of nuclear test and oil pollution was reflected in the 1963 Test Ban Treaty and the 1954 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• First EC environmental act was passed in 1967.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Ramsar Convention on Wetlans of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat, 1971 was adopted. It was the first environmental treaty to establish rules addressing the conservation of a particular type of ecosystem.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">.<i>Which </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b> Major Trend:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Co-ordinate effort of UN to place a system for dealing the international environmental issues.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Significant regional and global conventions were adopted.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• For the first time, at the global level, the production, consumption, international trade and movement of certain products were banned.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Major Events:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Stockholm Conference, 1972 is the most significant event of the period, Convened by the GA under auspices of Sweden.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Conference adopted 3 nonbinding instruments of which the Stockholm declaration marks a greater achievement towards formulating Int. treaty regime regarding environment and the resolution paved the way for establishing UNEP.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>3.4. United Nations Conference on the human environment, 1972:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The 1972 United Nations Conference on the human environment focused on the ‘human’ environment. The Conference issued the Declaration on the Human Environment, a statement containing 26 principles and 109 recommendations (now referred to as the Stockholm Declaration). The creation of an environmental agency was also approved, now known as UNEP. In addition, there was the adoption of a Stockholm Action Program. There were no legally binding outcomes resulting from the Stockholm Conference. Principle 21 of the Declaration was a restatement of law already in existence since Roman times, namely that of ‘good neighborliness’. The Action Plan was never successfully followed by any country.<a href=""#_ftn12"" name=""_ftnref12"" title="""">[12]</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>3.5. Rio Conference, 1992:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The 1992 Rio Conference, UNCED (also known as the Earth Summit) led to the adoption of several important legally binding environmental treaties, being the 1992 United Nations Frame work Convention on Climate Change and the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity. In addition to these, the parties adopted a ‘soft law’ (non-binding agreement) Declaration on Environment and Development which reaffirmed the Stockholm Declaration and provided 27 principles guiding environment and development (now referred to as the Rio Declaration). Another influential soft law document that the parties adopted was agenda 21, a guide to implementation of the treaties agreed to at the Summit and a guide as to the principles of sustainable development. Agenda 21 also established the United Nations Commissions on Sustainable Development (CSD) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF). Finally, the non-legal, non-binding Forest Principles were formed at the Earth Summit.<a href=""#_ftn13"" name=""_ftnref13"" title="""">[13]</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>3.6. The major lacking of Stockholm Conference 1972 with Comparing RIO Declaration:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The UNCED held in Rio Janirio in June 1992 was also marked for introducing a new overarching field of International law for sustainable development. It intends to address global environmental issues embodied in the agenda 21 without affecting the international environmental law as a distinctive branch.<a href=""#_ftn14"" name=""_ftnref14"" title="""">[14]</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In some particular ways the 1992 Rio Conference is wider than the Stockholm Conference, 1972.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b> 1. Principle-21 of Stockholm Conference:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">States have in accordance with the charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdictions or control do not cause damage to the environment of other states on of areas beyond the limits of natural jurisdiction.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b> Principle-2 of Rio Conference (UNCED): </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">States have in accordance with the charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental and developmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdictions or control do not damage to the environment of other states on of areas beyond the limits of national.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Stockholm Conference does not mention developmental policies.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2. Principle.22 of Stockholm Conference:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">States shall cooperate to develop further the international law regarding liability and compensation for the victims of pollution and other environmental damage caused by activities within the jurisdiction or control of such states to areas beyond their jurisdiction.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Principle.27 of Rio Conference (UNCED):</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">States and people shall cooperate in good faith and in a spirit of partnership in the fulfillment of the principles embodied in this declaration and in the further development of international law in the field of sustainable development.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">So, sustainable development is established in Rio Conference.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>3. Principle.7 of Rio Conference:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">States shall cooperate in a spirit of global partnership to conserve, protect and restore the health and integrity of the earth’s ecosystem. In view of the different contribution to global environmental degradation, states have common but differentiated responsibilities. The developed countries acknowledge the responsibility that they bear in the international pursuit to sustainable development in view of the pressures their societies place on the global environment and of the technologies and financial resources they command.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Principle.3 of Rio Conference (UNCED):</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">So, common but differentiated responsibilities and equitable meet for present and future generation is mentioned in Rio Conference not Stockholm.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>P.23 of Stockholm:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Without prejudice to such criteria as may be agreed upon by the international community or to standards which will have to be determined nationally, it will be essential in all causes to consider the system of values prevailing in each country, and the extent of the applicability of standards which are valid for the most advanced countries but which may be in appropriate and of unwarranted social cost for the developing countries.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Principle.11 of Rio:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">State shall enact effective environmental legislation. Environmental standards, management objectives and priorities should reflect the environment and development context to which they apply. Standards applied by some countries may be inappropriate and of unwarranted economic and social cost to other countries, in particular developing countries.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>5. Principle.15 of Rio:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied the states according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage luck of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">But Stockholm not mentioned precautionary approach.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">6. <b>Principle.16 of Rio:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">National Authorities should endeavour to promote the initialization of environmental costs and the use of economic instruments taking into account the approach that the polluter should in principle bear the cost of pollution, with due regard to the public interest and without distorting international trade and investment.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Stockholm Conference not such type of nature.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>7. Principle.18 of Rio:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">State shall immediately notify other states of any natural disasters or other emergencies that are likely to produce sudden harmful effects on the environment of those states. Every effort shall be made by the international community to help states so afflicted.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Stockholm Conference has no Principle for right of information.<a href=""#_ftn15"" name=""_ftnref15"" title=""""><b>[15]</b></a></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Principle.19 of Rio:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">States shall provide prior and timely notification and relevant information to potentially affected states on activities that may have a significant adverse transboundary environmental effect and shall consult with those states at an early stage and in good faith.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>8. Principle.26 of Rio:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">States shall resolve all their environmental disputes peacefully and by appropriate means in accordance with the charter of the United Nations.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Stockholm Conference does not mention to share the environmental disputes peacefully.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>9. Principle.20 of Rio (Women):</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Women have a vital note in environmental management and development. Their full participation is therefore essential to achieve sustainable development.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>P.21 of Rio (Youth):</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The creativity ideas and courage of the youth of the world should be mobilized to forge a global partnership in order to achieve sustainable development and ensure a better future for all.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Principle.22 Communities Indigenous People:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Indigenous people and their communities and other local communities have a vital role in environmental management and development because of their knowledge and traditional practices. State should recognize and duly support their identity, culture and interests and enable their effective participation in the achievement of sustainable development.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">But Stockholm Conference has not any provision for right of women, right of indigenous people and youth. So, UNCED is a great achievement for environmental issue.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>3.7.Sustainable Development: </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Sustainable development is a pattern of resource use that aims to meet human needs while preserving the environment so that these needs can be met not only in the present, but also for future generations. The term was used by the Brundtland Commission which coined what has become the most often-quoted definition of sustainable development as development that “meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”<a href=""#_ftn16"" name=""_ftnref16"" title="""">[16]</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Sustainable development ties together concern for the carrying capacity of natural systems with the social challenges facing humanity. As early as the 1970s “sustainability” was employed to describe an economy “in equilibrium with basic ecological support systems.” Ecologists have pointed to the “limits of growth” and presented the alternative of a “steady state economy” in order to address environmental concerns.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• The field of sustainable development can be conceptually broken into three constituent parts: environmental sustainability, economic sustainability and sociopolitical sustainability.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The concept has included notions of weak sustainability, strong sustainability and deep ecology. Sustainable development does not focus solely on environmental issues. The United Nations 2005 World Summit Outcome Document refers to the “interdependent and mutually reinforcing pillars” of sustainable development as economic development, social development, and environmental protection.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Indigenous people have argued, through various international forums such as the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and the Convention on Biological Diversity, that there are four pillars of sustainable development, the fourth being cultural. The Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity (UNESCO, 2001) further elaborates the concept by stating that “…cultural diversity is as necessary for humankind as biodiversity is for nature”; it becomes “one of the roots of development understood not simply in terms of economic growth, but also as a means to achieve a more satisfactory intellectual, emotional, moral and spiritual existence”. In this vision, cultural diversity is the fourth policy area of sustainable development.<a href=""#_ftn17"" name=""_ftnref17"" title="""">[17]</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Economic Sustainability: Agenda 21 clearly identified information, integration, and participation as key building blocks to help countries achieve development that recognises these interdependent pillars. It emphasises that in sustainable development everyone is a user and provider of information. It stresses the need to change from old sector-centred ways of doing business to new approaches that involve cross-sectoral co-ordination and the integration of environmental and social concerns into all development processes. Furthermore, Agenda 21 emphasises that broad public participation in decision making is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving sustainable development.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Sustainability is a process which tells of a development of all aspects of human life affecting sustenance. It means resolving the conflict between the various competing goals, and involves the simultaneous pursuit of economic prosperity, environmental quality and social equity famously known as three dimensions (triple bottom line) with is the resultant vector being technology, hence it is a continually evolving process; the ‘journey’ (the process of achieving sustainability) is of course vitally important, but only as a means of getting to the destination (the desired future state). However, the ‘destination’ of sustainability is not a fixed place in the normal sense that we understand destination. Instead, it is a set of wishful characteristics of a future system.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Green development is generally differentiated from sustainable development in that Green development prioritizes what its proponents consider to be environmental sustainability over economic and cultural considerations. Proponents of Sustainable Development argue that it provides a context in which to improve overall sustainability where cutting edge Green development is unattainable. For example, a cutting edge treatment plant with extremely high maintenance costs may not be sustainable in regions of the world with fewer financial resources. An environmentally ideal plant that is shut down due to bankruptcy is obviously less sustainable than one that is maintainable by the community, even if it is somewhat less effective from an environmental standpoint.<a href=""#_ftn18"" name=""_ftnref18"" title="""">[18]</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Some research activities start from this definition to argue that the environment is a combination of nature and culture. The Network of Excellence “Sustainable Development in a Diverse World”, sponsored by the European Union, integrates multidisciplinary capacities and interprets cultural diversity as a key element of a new strategy for sustainable development.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Still other researchers view environmental and social challenges as opportunities for development action. This is particularly true in the concept of sustainable enterprise that frames these global needs as opportunities for private enterprise to provide innovative and entrepreneurial solutions. This view is now being taught at many business schools including the Center for Sustainable Global Enterprise at Cornell University and the Erb Institute for Global Sustainable Enterprise at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The United Nations Division for Sustainable Development lists the following areas as coming within the scope of sustainable development: <a href=""#_ftn19"" name=""_ftnref19"" title="""">[19]</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Agriculture ,Atmosphere. Biodiversity, Capacity-building, Climate Change Consumption and Production Patterns, Demographics, Desertification and Drought , Disaster Reduction and Management, Education and Awareness, Ecology,Ecosystem etc.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Sustainable development is an eclectic concept, as a wide array of views fall under its umbrella. The concept has included notions of weak sustainability, strong sustainability and deep ecology. Different conceptions also reveal a strong tension between ecocentrism and anthropocentrism. The concept remains weakly defined and contains a large amount of debate as to its precise definition.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">During the last ten years, different organizations have tried to measure and monitor the proximity to what they consider sustainability by implementing what has been called sustainability metrics and indices.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Sustainable development is said to set limits on the developing world. While current first world countries polluted significantly during their development, the same countries encourage third world countries to reduce pollution, which sometimes impedes growth. Some consider that the implementation of sustainable development would mean a reversion to pre-modern lifestyles.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Others have criticized the overuse of the term:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“The word sustainable has been used in too many situations today, and ecological sustainability is one of those terms that confuse a lot of people. You hear about sustainable development, sustainable growth, sustainable economies, sustainable societies, and sustainable agriculture. Everything is sustainable (Temple, 1992).”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Brundt land Commission:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Brundtland Commission, formally the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED), known by the name of its Chair Grow Harlem Brundtland, was convened by the United Nations in 1983. The commission was created to address growing concern “about the accelerating deterioration of the human environment and natural resources and the consequences of that deterioration for economic and social development.” In establishing the commission, the UN General Assembly recognized that environmental problems were global in nature and determined that it was in the common interest of all nations to establish policies for sustainable development.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Resolution establishing the Commission:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The 1983 General Assembly passed Resolution 38/161; “Process of preparation of the Environmental Perspective to the Year 2000 and Beyond” establishing the Commission. In A/RES/38/161, the General Assembly:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“8. Suggests that the Special Commission, when established, should focus mainly on the following terms of reference for its work:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(a) To propose long-term environmental strategies for achieving sustainable development to the year 2000 and beyond;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(b) To recommend ways in which concern for the environment may be translated into greater co-operation among developing countries and between countries at different stages of economic and social development and lead to the achievement of common and mutually supportive objectives which take account of the interrelationships between people, resources, environment and development;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(c) To consider ways and means by which the international community can deal more effectively with environmental concerns, in the light of the other recommendations in its report;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(d) To help to define shared perceptions of long-term environmental issues and of the appropriate efforts needed to deal successfully with the problems of protecting and enhancing the environment, a long-term agenda for action during the coming decades, and aspirational goals for the world community, taking into account the relevant resolutions of the session of a special character of the Governing Council in 1982;”</p>

The Report was welcomed by the General Assembly in its resolution 42/187.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The report deals with sustainable development and the change of politics needed for achieving that. The definition of this term in the report is quite well known and often cited:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It contains within it two key concepts:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• The concept of ‘needs’, in particular the essential needs of the world’s poor, to which overriding priority should be given; and</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• the idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment’s ability to meet present and future needs.”</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The above discussions reveal the fact that the principles of international environmental law reflected in the multilateral environmental have been formulated at various stages of environmental regime. Some of them have already acquired the status of customary international law, while the others are still evolving. It is also apparent that the scholars express contradictory views about their legal status. However, their increasing use by the international community reflects its political commitment to give further effect to these principles.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Moreover, these principles have been embodied in some recent conventions and protocols as a standard of framing out the detailed obligations for the parties. A proper appreciation of the legal status of these principles can be a useful means to examine and understand the extent of obligations of developing countries under various multilateral environmental treaties.<a href=""#_ftn20"" name=""_ftnref20"" title="""">[20]</a></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Approach of the Developed Country in Global Warming and Climate Change</b></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">4.1. Climate change – a developing country:</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The issue of climate change from a developing country perspective and develops an outline of a win-win-oriented climate policy around development priorities. It demonstrates how the great climate debate between the ‘skeptics’ and ‘supporters’ does not lead developing countries anywhere. The article shows that the emerging middle-path approach, which suits developing countries, will lead to win-win opportunities both for the environment and the economy. The proponents of this approach are termed as ‘climate realists’, who consider climate mitigation as a by-product of sustainable development solutions. The article also discusses the issue of discount rate that should be applied for problems which are likely to peak in the medium to long-term future. Finally, various market-based mechanisms with ‘no-regret options’ are discussed and we advocate the use of sustainable development paradigm for climate-change policies.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The division of world opinion on the certainty of climate change adds to the woes of developing countries. Scientists acknowledge a temperature increase of the earth and attribute this episode of global warming to human activity of fossil-fuel burning. However, what scientists disagree is on the magnitude and speed of future climate change and hence the response pattern. One school of thought urges ‘rapid action’, whereas the other advocates ‘wait and watch’ policy. The uncertainties hover around the following facts: whether GHGs and aerosol concentrations increase, stay the same or decrease; how strongly the features of the climate (e.g. temperature, precipitation and sea level) respond to changes in GHG and aerosol concentrations, and how much the climate varies as a result of natural influences (e.g. from volcanic activity and changes in the intensity of the sun) and its internal variability (referring to random changes in the circulation ofthe atmosphere and oceans). The uncertainty of the exact nature or timing of the impacts means that a flexible and responsive approach to climate preparation will be needed.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Faced with these challenges of climate change, economic development and sustainability, the future of energy and environmental policies in developing countries has been a hot topic among policy makers and academics. The most promising policy approaches would be those that capitalize on natural synergies between development priorities and climate protection, which simultaneously advance both these efforts.<a href=""#_ftn21"" name=""_ftnref21"" title="""">[21]</a></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; text-autospace: none;"">Air pollution is one of a variety<br/>
of man-made environmental disasters that are currently taking place all over<br/>
the world. It<br/>
has a great impact on human health, climate change, agriculture, and the<br/>
natural ecosystem (Decker et al., 2000; Mayer et al., 2000; Molina and Molina,<br/>
2004; Molina et al., 2004). Because of the modernization and industrialization,<br/>
developing countries are confronted with the great challenge of controlling the<br/>
atmospheric pollution, specially in the rapidly growing megacities. Concern<br/>
about air pollution in urban regions is receiving increasingly importance<br/>
worldwide, specially pollution by gaseous and particulate matter (Azad and<br/>
Kitada, 1998; Salam et al., 2003; Begum et al., 2004; and Cachier et al.,<br/>
2005). The particulate matters are commonly described by using a number of<br/>
terms and the most common is “atmospheric aerosol”, which refers the<br/>
colloidal-sized atmospheric particles in gas.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; text-autospace: none;"">Aerosol<br/>
particles scatter and absorb solar and terrestrial radiation, they are involved<br/>
in the formation of clouds and precipitation as cloud condensation and ice<br/>
nuclei and thereby in hydrologic cycle and climate forcing, they affect the<br/>
abundance and distribution of atmospheric trace gases by heterogeneous chemical<br/>
reactions and other multiphase processes. (Penner et al., 2001; Ramanathan et<br/>
al., 2001; Finlayson-Pitts et al.,2000). Moreover, airborne particles play an<br/>
important role in the spreading of biological organisms, reproductive materials,<br/>
and pathogens (pollen, bacteria, spores, viruses, etc.), and they can cause or<br/>
enhance respiratory, cardiovascular, infectious, and allergic diseases<br/>
(Finlayson-Pitts et al.,2000; Bernstein et al., 2004; Hinds, 1999).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; text-autospace: none;""><b>1.1.</b><b><br/>
Background to Context</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; text-autospace: none;"">Like<br/>
different parts of the world, in Southeast Asia, the atmospheric pollution due<br/>
to aerosols has already been documented. Recent large-scale field experiments<br/>
in Southeast Asia (e.g. INDOEX) revealed the existence of widespread aerosol<br/>
layers, including highly absorbing material (black carbon) and mineral dust<br/>
(Satheesh and Ramanath, 2000).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; text-autospace: none;"">Bangladesh,<br/>
a developing country in South Asia where uncontrolled emission of gaseous<br/>
pollutants and aerosols from motor vehicles and other anthropogenic activities<br/>
related to extremely high population densities gives rise to severe atmospheric<br/>
and other forms of pollution (Biswas et al., 2001). Dhaka, one of the mega<br/>
cities of the world, witnessed a very fast growth of urban population in recent<br/>
times. Air pollution in Dhaka city is reported to be serious and damaging to<br/>
public health. In the winter of 1996-1997, air pollution of Dhaka city became<br/>
the severest when lead in the air was reported higher than the other place of<br/>
the world (Ahmed, 1997). Concern over air pollution rate of Dhaka city due to<br/>
various toxic gases and articulate matters ultimately led to the promulgation<br/>
of National Ambient Air Quality Standards in Bangladesh in 1997.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; text-autospace: none;"">Besides<br/>
mans and animals, air pollutant particularly atmospheric aerosols are detrimental<br/>
to plants. Plants are far more sensitive to pollution than animals or man. Therefore,<br/>
plants are also used as indicators of pollution level. Soil is another<br/>
important indicator of pollution. Various kinds of pollutants are deposited<br/>
into the soil from air including the aerosol particles. Once the constituents<br/>
of aerosols are introduced into the soil, they enter into the food chain,<br/>
ultimately affecting human being and its cattle heads. Therefore, the air<br/>
pollution due to aerosols along with other pollutants are not only coincides<br/>
into the air but also causes soil pollution, poses threat to man, animal and<br/>
also detrimental to water quality. As a whole, the constituents of atmospheric<br/>
aerosols, beyond their reference level are a matter of great fact to the<br/>
environment.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify; text-autospace: none;"">Aerosols are ubiquitous and are<br/>
an important feature of the earth’s atmosphere (Coe and Allan, 2006). An<br/>
aerosol can be defined as a <i>dispersion of solid and liquid particles<br/>
suspended in gas</i>. Atmospheric aerosols, unsurprisingly, refer to solid and<br/>
liquid particles suspended in air (Mészáros, 1981).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; text-autospace: none;"">In most<br/>
cases, this term is used to refer the particulate matter. But there is a slight<br/>
difference between particulate matter and the atmospheric aerosol. <b>Particulate matters </b>(<b>PM</b>) are tiny subdivisions<br/>
of solid matter suspended in a gas or liquid. In contrast, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol"" title=""Aerosol""><b><span style=""color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"">aerosol</span></b></a><br/>
refers to particles and/or liquid droplets and the gas together.<br/>
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates).</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"">Once aerosol is<br/>
suspended in the atmosphere, it is altered, removed or destroyed. It cannot<br/>
stay in the atmosphere indefinitely, and average lifetimes are of the order of<br/>
a few days to a week. Clearly the lifetime of any particular particle depends<br/>
on its size and location. Larger aerosol settle out of the atmosphere very<br/>
quickly under gravity, and some surfaces are more efficient at capturing<br/>
aerosol than others. Some removal pathways of the particle to the surface are (Chandrasekar, 2010, http://cloudbase.phy.umist.ac.uk/people/dorsey/Aero.htm):</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; text-align: justify;"">Wet deposition- deposition pathways involving<br/>

</span></b><b>Atmospheric Aerosols in Urban<br/>
Areas</b></p>
<p style=""margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify; text-autospace: none;"">The<br/>
majority of total particle emissions to the atmosphere that contribute to<br/>
aerosol formation are attributable to natural sources, such as suspended<br/>
terrestrial dust, oceans and seas, volcanoes, forest fires and natural gaseous<br/>
emissions. However, these emissions are dispersed rather evenly into the<br/>
atmosphere and, therefore, result in a relatively low tropospheric background<br/>
particle concentration. The natural sources that have the greatest impact on<br/>
the urban particle concentrations in Europe include suspended terrestrial dust,<br/>
sea salt spray (mainly at coastal sites) and biomass burning (forest fires)<br/>
(Salaman et al., 2007).</p>
<p style=""margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify; text-autospace: none;"">The<br/>
major sources of anthropogenic, i.e., man-made, particles include:</p>

Industrial and traffic-related fugitive emissions (street dust).</p>
<p style=""margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify; text-autospace: none;"">The<br/>
major components of urban atmospheric aerosols are typically sulphate,<br/>
ammonium, chloride, elemental carbon, organic carbon, crustal materials and<br/>
biological materials (bacteria, spores, pollens, debris and plant fragments)<br/>
(Harrison et al., 1997).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; text-autospace: none;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify; text-autospace: none;"">The distinction between<br/>
anthropogenic and natural particle sources and the emitted particulate matter<br/>
is sometimes difficult to make, for example, fugitive dust emissions and<br/>
biomass burning (BéruBé et al., 1997). In addition, there are large differences<br/>
in the relative importance of different sources from one geographical area to<br/>
another. For example, the greater part of emissions of primary particulate<br/>
matter in eastern parts of Europe originates from stationary combustion sources<br/>
and processes, whereas in western parts of Europe, emissions are more evenly<br/>
distributed among all economic sectors, although transport emissions play the<br/>
most significant role at many locations (ApSimon et al., 2000). In urban areas<br/>
Aerosol mass concentrations range from a few tens of ?g/m3 to 1 mg/m<sup>3</sup><br/>
during air pollution episodes in heavily polluted cities in developing<br/>
countries.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"">The most<br/>
common way to present particle size distribution data for the urban aerosol is<br/>
in terms of the three modes: <strong>nuclei mode (</strong>particle size&lt;<br/>
0.1 ?m, usually found near highways and other sources of combustion), <strong>accumulation<br/>
mode (</strong>0.1 ?m&lt; particle size &lt; 2.5 ?m, includes combustion<br/>

the year of Bangladesh is divided into four seasons, pre-monsoon (March–May),<br/>
Monsoon (June-September), post-monsoon (October-November) and winter<br/>
(December-February). Aerosol, soil, plant and human blood samples were<br/>
collected in the months of October and November, i.e. in the post monsoon<br/>
season. During the sampling period, the average temperature variation was<br/>
27-32ºC. Moderately higher temperatures were observed in the afternoon. Sunny<br/>
days were observed during the sampling period with an average wind speed of 3<br/>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">3.3.1.<br/>
Aerosol Sample</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Aerosol samples were collected by<br/>
two sets of low volume samplers. The samplers were equipped with poly-carbonate<br/>
open-face filter holders. One sampler was supported with PTFE filters (Pall<br/>
Corp., Gelman Lab., Zefluor, 1.0 µm pore size, 47mm diameter) applying an<br/>
averaged sampled air volume of 25 m<sup>3</sup>, and the other sampler was with<br/>
quartz fiber filters (Gelman, Membrane Filters, Type TISSUQUARTZ 2500QA-UP, 47<br/>
mm diameter) applying an averaged sampled air volume of 22 m<sup>3</sup>.<br/>
Sampling periods were around 8 hour (daytime, 10.00 a.m. 18.00 p.m.). To<br/>
collect the aerosol samples sampling heads were placed 3m above the ground as<br/>
the open-face filter sampling heads faced downwards and for protection from<br/>
rains, sampling heads were sheltered by 10 L polyethylene-buckets, which were<br/>
mounted on a pile the open side down. This yielded an aerosol fraction<br/>
equivalent to “Total Suspended Particles” (TSP).Field blanks were determined<br/>
for each sampling site and considered for the calculation procedures. The<br/>
loaded filters were stored in clean Millipore Petri dishes and kept under refrigeration<br/>
during the sampling. The total replication numbers of the samples were divided<br/>
into two. Half of the replications were transported to Vienna, Austria, by air<br/>
luggage for some chemical analysis and from the other half of the sample’s<br/>
replication the analysis of trace elements were conducted in the Advanced<br/>
Laboratory of the Department of Soil, Water and Environment of Dhaka<br/>
University.</p>

using spade and trowel. Soil samples from three points were collected from open<br/>
bare ground near each air-sampling site and mixed thoroughly. The collected<br/>
soil were packed by polyethylene bag and labeled properly with a marker pen.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Before the refrigeration of<br/>
aerosol sample, the weight of loaded material in the filter was recorded and<br/>
also the weight of empty filter paper. From the difference of these two weights<br/>
the weight of collected particles were measured and then stored in<br/>
refrigerator. Aerosol samples did not require further processing. But, during<br/>
the analysis the samples were treated in different ways according to the<br/>
requirements of analysis.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"">Each of the collected<br/>
soil samples was dried in air by spreading on separate sheet of paper after it<br/>
was transported to the laboratory. For hastening drying, it was exposed to the<br/>
sunlight. After air drying, the larger and massive aggregates and gravel were<br/>
broken by crushing them gently with a wooden mortar. Dry roots, grasses and<br/>
scrubs were discarded from the sample. A portion of the ground samples were<br/>
screened to pass through a 0.5 mm sieve and then mixed thoroughly to make a<br/>
composite sample was kept in a plastic container and labeled properly.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"">The collected plant<br/>
samples were washed with de-ionized distilled water to remove the soil<br/>
particles. Roots, leaves and shoots were separated by cutting it after<br/>
transporting to the laboratory. The collected plant samples were initially<br/>
dried in air and ten cut into small pieces. The plant samples were then put into<br/>
an envelope with – proper labeling and kept in an oven at 654ºC for 48 hours.<br/>
After oven drying, the plant samples were cooled and then ground in an electric<br/>
grinder. The ground plant samples were mixed thoroughly. The samples were kept<br/>
in a plastic bag with proper labeling and stored in desiccators for further<br/>
analysis.</p>

conducted both in the laboratory of the Department of Soil, Water and<br/>
Environment of the university of Dhaka, Bangladesh and in Vienna. The trace<br/>
element contents were determined in Bangladesh and the contents of carbonaceous<br/>
aerosols and soluble ions were determined in the Laboratory of Vienna, Austria.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: .25in; text-align: justify;""><b>a) </b><b>Total<br/>
Carbon (TC)</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Total carbon was determined by<br/>
combustion method in a set up originally described by Puzbausm and Rendl<br/>
(1983). One aliquot of the quartz fiber filter (a punch of 12 mm ?) was combusted in an oven at<br/>
1000ºC in a pure oxygen stream. The resulting CO2 was detected using a Maihak<br/>
Unor 6N Nondisperisvie Infrared (NDIR) analyszer. The area of the CO2 peaks was<br/>
calibrated using phthalic acid standards corresponding to 1-100?g C. TC can be<br/>
described as “ noncarbonated carbon” (e.e. sum of elemental and organic<br/>
carbon), as carbonate carbon determined with the thermo graphic method from a<br/>
selected set of samples was about 1% of TC.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"">Elemental carbon was<br/>
determined with two-step thermal method of Cachier et al. (1989) following<br/>
exactly the prescribed procedure. The filter (a punch of 10 mm ?) was pre-treated thermally for<br/>
two hours in a muffle oven at 340ºC in a pure oxygen atmosphere (flow 3 L/min).<br/>
By this treatment, according to Cachier et al. (1989), the organic material is<br/>
removed, whereas the elemental carbon remains on the filter punch. Then it was<br/>
introduced into the above described combustion unit for TC -0 yielding the EC<br/>
value after “Cachier”. A round robin test of EC/OC methods on urban samples<br/>
from Berlin showed good agreement of the “Cachier” method with other methods<br/>
considered reliable in the test (Schmid et al., 2001).</p>

Mohakhali followed by Mirpur, Mohammadpur,Dhanmondi, Curzon Hall and Farmgate.<br/>
The average value of EC in urban sites of Dhaka are 0.46 ?g/m<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"">There are no<br/>
international air quality standards for elemental carbon. But there is<br/>
alternative guideline value of 8 ?g/m<sup>3</sup> in Germany ( TA – Luf, 1995).<br/>
It has to be pointed out, that inter-comparison of EC (and OC) value between<br/>
different studies bear uncertainties as results are quite dependent on the<br/>
method used for EC/OC determination (Schmid et al., 2001). It appears that the<br/>
EC levels in European, US and East Asian cities (e.g. Tokyo, Japan) are below<br/>
10 ?g/m<sup>3</sup>, whereas at large cities in the Indian sub-continent EC<br/>
levels were above 10 ?g/m<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Elemental carbon in the air has<br/>
different sources such as diesel engine emissions. Fossil fuel combustion at<br/>
low burning efficiency and biomass burning (Salam et al., 2003). Emission from<br/>
diesel engines, as well as from oil and coal fired stationary sourcres, exhibit<br/>
EC/TC ratios around 0.1 – 0.2 have been reported (Cachier et al., 1995; Novakov<br/>
et al., 2000), although for fuel wood combustion in India, quite higher values<br/>
e.g. 0.6 have been observed (Reddy and Venkataraman, 2002), yielding an<br/>
averaged EC/TC ratio of 0.25 for total biomass combustion emissions of<br/>
India.  The EC/TC ratio might also be<br/>
shifted to lower values by admixture of OC from non-pyrogenic sources. Thus, it<br/>
can be concluded that biomass fuel combustion is a major source of EC in the<br/>
atmosphere of Dhaka.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">4.1.2. Organic Carbon</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Oranic carbon (OC) is a complex<br/>
mixture of several hundreds of organic compounds. The average organic carbon<br/>
(OC) at the six areas of Dhaka was in the range of 3.32-10.36 ?g/m<sup>3</sup><br/>
(Table 4.1.1). The highest OC of these sites was observed at Mohakhali with<br/>
very high traffic congestion followed by Mirpur, Dhanmondi, Mohmmadpur,<br/>
Farmgate and Curzon Hall.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"">Organic carbon (OC)<br/>
has potentially even more sources than EC, as in addition to diesel engine<br/>
emissions, fossil fuel combustion at low burning efficiency, biomass burning,<br/>
also gasoline driven cars emit OC; but also cooking contribute OC emission<br/>
(Salam et al., 2003). The grand average value of urban sites is 5.24 ?g/m<sup>3</sup>.<br/>
A value of around 6 ?g/m<sup>3</sup> has been attributed in the South African<br/>
Savanna originating from natural vegetative sources (Puxbaum et al., 2000).<br/>
High OC values as observed in Dhaka, up to 10.36 ?g/m<sup>3</sup> as site<br/>
average, can be only explained because of anthropogenic activities. There is<br/>
the possibility that a certain function of the OC is derived from biogenic<br/>
sources.</p>

observed that concentrations of Pb in soils along the roadsides of the urban of<br/>
Dhaka varied from 9.75-23.6 mg/kg (Table 4.2.3 and <span style=""color: #00b050;"">Fig.<br/>

found at Curzon Hall and the lower at Mohakhali. As the average concentration<br/>
of Pb  in soil is 0.1 – 20 mg/kg  (Sauerbeck, 1985). It indicated that the<br/>
collected soil samples were not contaminated due to Pb, except Curzon Hall.<br/>
Among the sampling sites, Curzon Hall showed the higherst level of Pb followed<br/>
by Farmage. Considereing Pb accumulation in soils, the following sequence of Pb<br/>
pollution was observed: Curzon Hall &gt; Farmgate &gt; Mohammadpur&gt;Mirpur<br/>
&gt; Dhanmondi &gt;Mohakhali.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As the highest numbers of<br/>
automobiles (Truck, bus, taxi et.) moved through the Curzon Hall and Farmgate<br/>
of Dhaka city, the soils of the at sites were highly contaminated and as the<br/>
less number of motor vehicles is used in Dhanmondi and Mohammadpur route the<br/>
soils of these areas were found to be least contaminated. But one of the<br/>
exception was Mohakhali, this may be due to experimental error. Davison and<br/>
Osborn (1986) mentioned that, the transport of Pb, As and Cd depends on their<br/>
physical – Chemical prosperities, the particle size distribution and<br/>
meterological conditions such as rate of turbulent, vertical air exchange and<br/>
wind speed and the former two parameters are dominant in the long range<br/>
transport of Pb, As and Cd. Rahn, (1976) mentioned that the residence time of<br/>
Pb, As and Cd in the atmosphere are found to be about 7 days, which is<br/>
sufficient for transport over thousands of kilometers.</p>

mg/kg (Sauerbeck, 1985). In six sites of Dhaka city, all the soils from every<br/>
site has Cd content within the range. The Cd concentration was higher in soils<br/>
of Mohakhali due to heavy traffic passing through the area. It also indicated<br/>
that motor wastes and fumes play a vital reole in adding Cd to the soils.<br/>
Lagerweff and Specht (1970) mentioned that, Zn and Cd might also be added to<br/>
soils adjacent to highways and the sources being tyres and lubricants. Ardakani<br/>
(1984) stated that, Zinc and Cadmium are added to lubricating oils and also present<br/>
in tyers and gavvanized parts of the vehicles. Sanchidrian and Marino ( 1980)<br/>
mentioned that there was high degree of heavy metals such as Cd, Pb, Zn and Cr<br/>
contamination of soils surrounding six motorways in Madrid and it was assumed<br/>
that motor exhausts was the source of these metals. Considering Cd accumulation<br/>
in soils, the following sequences of Cd pollution intensity was observed.</p>

in the normal range. It was found that difgference in Zn accumulation by the<br/>
same plant species form one spot to another could be related to the soil<br/>
condition collected from the roadside which was influenced by automobile<br/>
exhausts and spillage being continuously added to the soils and on the plants<br/>
foliages. Fytianos et at., (1985) observed contamination of roadside vegetation<br/>
with Zn and Cd in Thessaloniki area in Greece. Das et al., (1989) found<br/>
significantly higher contents of Zn along with Pb, Cu, Cd and Fe in the plants<br/>
exposed to vehicle pollution than in control nursery plants. Moreover, Maskina<br/>
and Randhawa (19893) stated that poultry manure, farmyard manure and other<br/>
organic manure increased the Zn concentration in plant. Atmospheric transport<br/>
of air borne Zn particles exhausted from motor vehicles and their deposition on<br/>
plant surface might be the cause of this high Zn concentration. Moreover,<br/>
agricultural inputs such as might contribute to high Zn content in soils, which<br/>
was taken up by plants entering fertilizers, pesticides and farmyard manure,<br/>
etc. into food chain and polluting the environment.</p>

observed in agricultural soils of Bhola, which indicated that fertilizers,<br/>
pesticides and organic manure, etc. contribute a high content of Fe to the<br/>
soil. On the other hand, rural areas of Dhaka division also showed higher Fe<br/>
concentration than the normal roadside of urban areas of Dhaka that might be<br/>
due to the addition of sewage sludge, garbage, etc. containing high amounts of<br/>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Plant samples were investigated<br/>

Fig. 4.3 – 4.45) plant, whereas the average concentration of Fe in plant is 140<br/>
mg/kg (Allaway, 1970). As Fe chelates with organic matter, becomes available to<br/>
plant. Plants growing on high Fe and organic matter containing soils take up<br/>
higher amounts of Fe into plants might have often – interfere with plant  <i>biochemistry</i>.<br/>
Moreover, consumption of plants with such high Fe might have adverse effect on<br/>
animal and human begins. It was observed that almost all the concentrations<br/>
were above the normal range of plant. The accumulation of this heavy metal in<br/>
plant is regulated by plant is regulated by plant through some mechanisms,<br/>
which were dependent on the plant species or variety. The difference in<br/>
accumulation of Fe by the same species form one spot to another could be<br/>
related variations in soil conditions, plant growth stages and plant parts. Das<br/>
et al., (1989) showed that, significantly higher content of Pb, Zn and Fe were<br/>
found in the plants exposed to vehicle pollution than in control nursery<br/>
plants. They also mentioned that leaves accumulated more of these heavy metals<br/>
than other plant parts.</p>

mg/kg (Table 4.3.3 and Fig. 4.3 – 4.45) whereas the normal concentration of Fe<br/>
in soil is 7000 – 55000 mg/kg (Bowen, 1966). It was found that the collected<br/>
soils contained Fe within normal range.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In urban areas of Dhaka, Farmgate<br/>
showed the highest level of Fe followed by Science laboratory crossing.<br/>
Considering Fe accumulation in soils, the following sequence of Fe pollution<br/>
was observed.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Farmgate &gt; Science laboratory<br/>
crossing &gt; Shahbagh crossing &gt; Nilkhet &gt; Mohammadpur.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Rural areas Dhaka division showed<br/>
that the concentrations of Fe varied from 28375 to 34375 mg/kg soil and the<br/>
highest value was observed at Bhola (35000 mg/kg soil, Table 4.3.3 and Fig. 4.3<br/>
– 4.45). The Fe content was higher in agricultural soils. The highest value was<br/>
observed in agricultural soils of Bhola, which indicated that fertilizers,<br/>
pesticides and organic manure, etc. contribute a high content of Fe to the<br/>
soil. On the other hand, rural areas of Dhaka division also showed higher Fe<br/>
concentration than the normal roadside of urban areas of Dhaka that might be<br/>
due to the addition of sewage sludge, garbage, etc. containing high amounts of<br/>
Fe. The following sequence of Fe contamination in soil was observed:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bhola &gt; Manikgonj &gt;<br/>
Munshigonj &gt; Zinzera &gt; Sonargoan.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Plant samples were investigated<br/>
for heavy metals. It was found that Fe content in plant did not follow any<br/>
definite pattern. It varied form 75 – 1085 mg/kg (Tables 4.4.2 – 4.11.2 and<br/>
Fig. 4.3 – 4.45) plant, whereas the average concentration of Fe in plant is 140<br/>
mg/kg (Allaway, 1970). As Fe chelates with organic matter, becomes available to<br/>
plant. Plants growing on high Fe and organic matter containing soils take up<br/>
higher amounts of Fe into plants might have often – interfere with plant  <i>biochemistry</i>.<br/>
Moreover, consumption of plants with such high Fe might have adverse effect on<br/>
animal and human begins. It was observed that almost all the concentrations<br/>
were above the normal range of plant. The accumulation of this heavy metal in<br/>
plant is regulated by plant is regulated by plant through some mechanisms,<br/>
which were dependent on the plant species or variety. The difference in<br/>
accumulation of Fe by the same species form one spot to another could be<br/>
related variations in soil conditions, plant growth stages and plant parts. Das<br/>
et al., (1989) showed that, significantly higher content of Pb, Zn and Fe were<br/>
found in the plants exposed to vehicle pollution than in control nursery<br/>
plants. They also mentioned that leaves accumulated more of these heavy metals<br/>
than other plant parts.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>In November 1995, Carl Lewis, a black male athlete was photographed for Pirelli; a tire firm which has a reputation for producing calendars with pictures for beautiful women. Lewis was publicized like a superman idolizing his superbly athletic body; however his ‘super masculinity’ was emasculated by the invocation of his ‘femininity’ as he was wearing stylish, red high-heeled shoes. Some people said that it is just an advertiser’s joke, some others argued that Carl Lewis has allowed himself to exploit by the big corporate company. Others argued that he calculatingly embarked to defy the traditional image of ‘masculinity’ (Hall 234).  Their reactions could have been for one of two related reasons.  The ad caption pointed out that there is ‘nothing without control’.  This caption when presented in conjunction with the area of anatomy pinpointed by the tip of the arrow, has the potential to raise worrying issues for some individuals. This may be in connection with the control of bodily waste (something rather than nothing) and/or issues of control associated with feminine self of a man.</p>
<p>In June 2010, Andreh Pejic, a Bosnian-born, Australian male fashion model was scouted for both the male and female runways at the Paris fashion shows. Unlike Carl Lewis, he was not castigated for his feminine traits and long blonde hair, rather his ambiguous, gender-bending features has bent a major buzz, made him the toast of the international fashion circuit from London to Paris to New York City and beyond. Although he initially had casting directors, modeling agencies, and designers alike wondering why a woman was walking men’s shows, he was soon booked for major editorial spreads in influential fashion magazines such as <em>Vogue Paris</em>, <em>i-D</em> and <em>L’Officiel</em>.</p>
<p>These two cases in point exemplify that how media all around the world are flouting the myths of masculinity which used to regard male bodies as empty vessels aiming to get filled up by the gender norms passed on to them from their social settings, their families and their peers. This attempt of socialization is changing all over the world. Male are now active participants in internalizing, reframing and reproducing their own versions of masculinities. In recent times this wind of change has also started to blow in Bangladeshi media. A lot of adverts of various products are being aired on Bangladeshi TV channels where tentative steps towards re-evaluating ‘stereotypical’ concepts of masculinity which cannot be overlooked. In this research I would like to read these recent changes in Bangladeshi media that attempts to deconstruct of gender stereotype which triggers the realization to refigure the convention of masculinity in the changing perspectives of Bangladesh.</p>
<p><strong>Methodology:</strong></p>
<p>This is primarily a library research, along with an intense focus on the audio-visual media. For the critical reading, Feminism, Postmodernism, Gender Studies, Cultural Studies, and Psychoanalytic Criticism have frequently been addressed here. The work plan of the paper can be outlined as below:</p>
<p>(a) Collection of primary and secondary source materials through library and the Internet;</p>
<p>(b) Viewing and reviewing of the materials collected;</p>
<p>(c) Reviewing of literary and cultural theories relevant to the study;</p>
<p>(d) Analyzing the rhetorical organization of the discourses;</p>
<p>(e) Data analysis: analyzing intersexuality of the discourses to explore discursive formations if any which these discourses produce or operate in;</p>
<p>(f) Composition; and</p>
<p>(g) Documentation</p>
<p><strong>Operational and Theoretical Frameworks:</strong></p>
<p>The paper concentrates on specific adverts being run in various Bangladeshi TV channels where a scope for re-conceptualizing masculinity is possible. The focus is on Bangladeshi adverts where the advertisers and ad-makers being inspired by the global trends are striding forward to break the rigid convention of masculinity embracing its varied types. Among those types this paper focuses specifically on ‘Androgyny’ which can be easily identified in various adverts of Bangladeshi regime of representation.  Both top grossing and alternative adverts are included in the study that one of the chief criteria of choosing adverts is their available telecasting in different channels. Regarding geographical dimension, this project relies on few Indian adverts aired in various Bangladeshi channels and being dubbed and lip-synced in Bengali.</p>
<p>It is essential to note here that though this paper primarily uses visual discourse where the recent media re-channels the myth of masculinity in terms of language, traditional, domestic affairs, professional aspects and trends; and no political or moral imperative is involved herewith. This study illustrates various aspects of Feminist theory, Psychoanalysis, Post-modernism and Cultural Studies, related to the main issue of the research.</p>
<p><strong>The Design of the Paper</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>The article is divided into five chapters. The first chapter, that is, the present one, discusses the objective of the project and makes the thesis statement. It also outlines the methodology and specifies the extent and design of the study. The second chapter introduces the prevalent myths of masculinity involving Gary Oliver’s five key myths of masculinity which had been a working force for the advertise makers. This segment attempts a psychoanalytic reading of these myths explicating their duplicitous prolongation to enlighten the truth that masculinity is not a fixed, inevitable, natural state of being, rather as a performance, or a mask that man often wear to shield  their vulnerabilities. The third chapter is an exemplifying chapter that studies screenplays of several relevant old and new commercials of various products. Estimating the prevailing features of the adverts projected in the earlier chapter, the fourth chapter reaches to the resolution understanding that particular version of masculinity which Bangladeshi Media is upholding nowadays. Additionally this section investigates the grounds behind the promoted version of masculinity and ends up fetching its impact on hegemonic masculine culture and consumer market of the country. The last chapter-“Conclusion”- summarizes the major arguments and suggests scope for further research in the related areas.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Acting” Like a Man: Masculine Myths and Stereotypes</strong></p>
<p>“Every man has breast but it is subdued by social restriction” (Bem 60) – this famous statement made by Sigmund Freud reveals that a man is an embodiment of both masculine and feminine entities. But society castrates everything what is feminine and reduces them to simple, vivid, memorable, easily grasped and widely recognized masculine characteristics, exaggerate and simplify them, and fix them without change and development to eternity. This what Stuart Hall called, ‘stereotyping’ (<em>Representation of </em><em>Other</em> 259) for which men are forced to emulate a fragmented identity. This chapter sheds light on how society constructs and informs prevalent myths about man and masculinity and how these myths trigger the stereotyped representation in media based. This chapter offers an explanation of these duplicitous myths, showing how far these are from the reality.</p>
<p>Gary Oliver’s “Myth”-Talk:</p>
<p>Gary Oliver, the author of <em>Raising Sons and Loving It!</em> (along with his wife, Carrie), has identified five key myths of masculinity:</p>
<p><em>Myth 1: A Man’s Man is Big, Brave, and Strong </em></p>
<p>Men are typically known by how big and tough they are. They are raised to be competitive. Value is placed on a man’s ability to win, to be brave, bigger, and stronger. Generally, girls are not reared with these priorities.</p>
<p><em>Myth 2: A Man’s Man Isn’t Emotional and Doesn’t Express Affection</em></p>
<p>Certainly, things have changed in the last ten to fifteen years in terms of the cultural openness to men expressing an emotional side. However, boys are still likely to be reared in a model that precludes men displaying or verbalizing emotions (other than anger).</p>
<p><em>Myth 3: A Man’s Man Isn’t Weak and Shouldn’t Cry</em></p>
<p>Historically, men have grown up learning that crying is a demonstration of weakness. They learn to repress emotions of pain and grief. Men who cry are chided for being “wimps” or “girly.”</p>
<p><em>Myth 4: A Man’s Man is an Expert on Sex</em></p>
<p>From a very early age, boys are bombarded by the culture with sexual images and messages. Adolescent boys learn to share sexual information and stories as if they were first-person experiences, even though most often they are not. This helps to create the myth that guys are experts on sex. This myth wreaks havoc with God’s design for sex and often results in a distorted view of women, an unhealthy focus on sexual performance, and hinders the ability to build healthy relationships with women.</p>
<p><em>Myth #5: A Man’s Value is Determined by What He Does and How Much He Earns</em></p>
<p>“What do you do?” “How much do you make?” These are often the first questions men hear when interacting with others. Men grow up learning how to compete and what a man does for a living and how much he earns is a key benchmark of value in our culture. This puts a lot of pressure on boys and men, placing an unhealthy focus on the material, rather than the spiritual.</p>
<p>These myths set off the stereotypical representation of man and masculinity in manifold levels of understanding. The mainstream media plays the most imperative role in reinforcing these myth-talks and initiates the ideas of a ‘real’ man as been projected in the media. In most media portrayals, male characters are rewarded for self-control and the control of others, aggression and violence, financial independence, and physical desirability.</p>
<p><strong>The Idea of Masculinity and the Media:</strong></p>
<p>In 1999, Children Now, a California-based organization that examines the impact of media on children and youth, released a report entitled “Boys to Men: Media Messages About Masculinity.” The report argues that the media’s portrayal of men tends to reinforce men’s social dominance. This report argues that the majority of male characters in media are heterosexual. They have been seen as the opposite of one dimensional gender scale where he has to be as masculine as much as possible. They are more often associated with the public sphere of work, rather than the private sphere of the home, and issues and problems related to work are more significant than personal issues. In <em>Tough Guise: Violence, Media and the Crisis in Masculinity</em>, Jackson Katz and Jeremy Earp argue that the media provide an important perspective on social attitudes—and that while the media are not the cause of violent behavior in men and boys, they do portray male violence as a normal expression of masculinity. Moreover, the pursuit of muscularity has implications beyond the desire to appear attractive. Physical bulk, particularly muscle, implies strength, virility, and dominance, all of which are consistent with the male gender role. Among the most widely accepted criteria for masculinity is an absence of feminine characteristics.</p>
<p>But the reality is that men do have those characteristics such as love, tenderness, gentleness, kindness, sensitivity, empathy, nurture, compassion which aren’t often associated as male emotions, yet these characteristics are attributed to Jesus in the four gospels. Jesus, a man, experienced and expressed deep emotion. Real men have the ability to express pain and grief with appropriate tears. Apart from the psychology, females are not the only gender who has body issue. The ideal man look as shown on TV, movies and advertising become increasingly muscular. In books like <em>The Sexuality of Men</em> (Metcalf and Humphries,1985), the author also says, as men began to reflect critically on masculinity, was a sense of the fears, anxieties and pin expressed by these men in relation to established scripts of masculinity: anxieties about sexual performance, estrangement from emotions and poor relation with father. As children, boys experience a wide range of emotions, yet somewhere along the line, they learn that men suppress emotions and remain calm, cool and collected at all times, even in the midst of crisis. The transmission of this model is often through their fathers. As they are growing up, boys often hear messages from their dads that girls never hear, such as:</p>
<p>—        “Suck it up.”</p>
<p>—        “No pain, no gain.”</p>
<p>—        “Are you a man or a mouse?”</p>
<p>—        “Act like a man.”</p>
<p>The super-male has become the standard of masculinity in our culture leaving many men trying desperately to measure up. A constant barrage of media images fuels societal expectations about body appearance in males. Adding to this pressure are the messages associated with each image of the muscle-bound male: social, sexual, and financial success depends on how well you mold your body to this image. The inability of attaining the perfect body becomes burden; they waste their time with self-hatred and regret which kill them softly. But reality is, true strength has very little to do with the physical.  Physical strength has its place, but being a man has to do with so much more, such as developing strong mental, emotional, spiritual, and relational characteristics. This is what it means to be a real man. Hence the recent media has re-channeled the myth of masculinity in its representational regime.</p>

<p>In an essay titled “Postmodernism and Consumer Society” Fredric Jameson identifies one key feature of postmodernism is that the line between high and popular culture are gone or beginning to fade, in an extended level, which co-relates the emergence of new formal features in culture with the emergence of a new type of social life. This chapter examines this key feature of postmodernism in the perspective of gender role which shows the sexist representation is also eroded in the postmodern media. In the modern period, the only accepted version of masculinity used to be the absence of any sort of feminine characteristics. Thus it showed a clear distinction between femininity and masculinity. But in the postmodern representation, the older distinctive bar of specific ‘<em>nity</em>’ no longer exists, thus media loses its earlier stereotypes. Hence, Jameson says,</p>
<p>We need only think of the way our sense of history has disappeared, of how our entire contemporary social system has little by little begun to lose its capacity to retain its own past. We live in a perpetual present. We might say that the media help us forget the past. (204-5)</p>
<p>Jameson’s identified features of postmodernism will be recurring devices in this section to understand how this nonsexist representation triggers the audience to re-conceptualize masculinity in the juncture of ‘newly emergent social order of late capitalism’ (193). To accomplish this task this section studies screenplays of several relevant old and new television commercials of various products.</p>
<p><strong>Andro vis-à-vis Gyno language:</strong></p>
<p>The advert of celebrating 75 years of the Lux brand has sparked the argument of this segment. After 50 Indian female film stars lathering up with Lux, Hindustan Lever has broken away the stereotype for the first time by featuring a male star. This advert not only changed the feminine face of its second largest selling soap brand to show reigning superstar Shahrukh Khan sitting in a tub of petals along with actresses of yesteryears who have already featured as Lux models, but it also set him to pronounce the customary female dialogue of this brand “<em>Aaj mein aapko batanewala hoon meri khubsuratein ka raaz — Lux. Ab batayein aapka favourite Lux Star kaun hai?</em>” (I want to tell you about my beauty secrets — Lux. Who is your favourite Lux Star?)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where in a gynocentric universe 1970s feminist like Elaine Showalter marks a distinction between andro (male) and  gyno (female) language with a view to construct a separate realm outside the male dominated culture, in this advert we see the male figure austerely uses gyno-language.  Showalter coined gynocriticism which is a broad and varied field, and any generalization should be treated with caution. (<em>Beginning </em><em>Theory</em>, Peter Barry, 118)  In a most cautionary manner this advert unifies both andro and gyno language in a single whole where the lead actor emulates style, themes and structure of an established female language. Applying Fredric Jameson’s ideas about postmodernism, the dialogue ‘my beauty secrets’ (<em>Meri Sundarta Ka Raaz</em>), cannot be termed as ‘parody’ which capitalizes on the uniqueness of these feminine styles, e.g., D.H. Lawrence’s nature imagery, seizing on their idiosyncrasies and eccentricities in order to produce an imitation which mocks the original, because, the target audience of this commercial has been always female. Shahrukh Khan is favourite with women of all ages. So he imitates the dialogue without any satirical impulse. Jameson calls this imitation as ‘pastiche’—a blank parody. Instead of showing Shahrukh as a macho man riding a horse like the “Marlboro man,” this advert portrays him as a metro sexual male who has a soft feminine touch both in his posture and language which is purposefully done to exert a pull on the female consumer society.</p>
<p><strong>Domesticating Masculinity and Masculinizing Domesticity</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>Referring to Davidoff and Hall’s <em>Family Fortunes, </em>Sean Nixon in his essay ‘Exhibiting Masculinity’ states that middleclass men’s ‘involvement in production, design, building, accountancy and insurance’ associated them with certain characteristics and competence which contrasted with the characteristics of middle class femininity.  This contrastive characteristics set man as responsible for the jobs in public sphere and woman to be responsible for ‘creating and servicing’ domestic sphere. Idealizing this notion, in media the portrayal of household also used to exclude men in advertising any sort of active function in the household environment. All domestic products were being featured by female characters even marginalizing man from fatherhood responsibilities. The U.S fatherhood movement of mid 1990s seeks to reestablish the necessity of men in families, constituting fatherhood as specifically male in differentiation from the feminizing connotations of family involvement. In this process, more male actors were encouraged to promote fatherhood-related issues or domestic products in the advertisements, both as television commercials and in billboards.</p>
<p>In Bangladesh also we can see the same thing happening. Recent days Bangladeshi actors Riaz or Jahid Hassan has been observed as cast for Wheel detergent powder, promoting how it washes dirty clothes without harming the soft skin, or Tahsan a renowned singer-cum actor features himself in a very feminine “Jui Coconut hair Oil” hair-care product commercial. Fathers’ participation in child rearing is not longer a “girly-thing” and is now also growing concerns in recent media mainly in the context of attempts to reconcile job and family life in dual breadwinner families. In a response to this issue, Lever Brothers introduced a series of adverts entitled ‘Pappu and Papa’  for Pepsodent toothpaste where Shahrukh Khan appears to be a more effectively caring father who can pursue his child in playful way to remain hygienic all the time.  But most significantly the advert which strikes the idea of this section is the TV commercial of Pran Curry Power where we see two men cooking in the kitchen and getting nostalgic. This advert opens through the conversation between them:</p>
<p>:           রান্না করে আমার আম্মাজান, জ়ীবনে কোনো্দিন দেখি নাই হলুদ মরিচ কম বেশি হইছে… (<em>It was my mother who used to cook and was accurate in using the spices</em>)</p>
<p>:           ধুর বেটা…মা’র কথা মনে করায় দিলি (<em>Oh dear! you just reminded me of </em><em>MY</em><em> mom</em>)</p>
<p>In Jameson’s term this advert is namely pastiche where the past is being remade. In earlier “curry powder” advertisements we could see that the mother sheds tears remembering her son who resides abroad. This advert directly mimics the older plot and provokes the same emotion ensuing a ‘nostalgic mood’—only this time the sadness is rather other way round.</p>
<p><strong>Beautifying Corporate Masculinity</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>In 2005 when Emami lunched India’s first fairness cream for men ‘Fair and Handsome’, it made some clamor. Initially it was criticized as a ‘parody’ which pokes fun on the female fairness creams’ famous brand ‘Fair and Lovely’, but later it turned out as some serious scientific issues and proved it as not a matter of joke. The product description says that men have tougher skin than women. It is more exposed to pollution; UV ray and stress factors, so “Emami Fair and Handsome Advanced Fairness Men Range” products are specially formulated for Men. Research also shows that 28% of all fairness cream users are men. Moreover, in 2006 “Fair and Lovely” introduces a new brand, ‘Menz Active’, which the radical “need” for fairness face-creams for men is no longer a feminine need. As in the advertisement of “Fair &amp; Lovely Menz Active” we see a job interview where the candidate is a user of the product. As the myth goes, ‘qualification’ is the only fact that constitutes man’s identity, beautification has nothing to do with it, and in a subversive level this advert alters this idea. Attempting a counter-narrative in the screenplay of this advert, we see a confident male jobseeker questions the employers’ panel:</p>
<p>:           আর কেউ নয় কেনো? (<em>Why not somebody else?)</em></p>
<p>:           কারণ যোগ্যতার বাইরেও আরো কিছু আছে (<em>There is something</em><em> beyond qualification</em><em>s</em>)</p>
<p>The quick cut reveals the secret explaining what this ‘something’ is. Yes, it is “Fair &amp; Lovely”—as it helps to add that “maximum impression.” Menz Active is also positioned along the same line as “Fair &amp; Lovely” when it was launched. Menz uses the punchline “Change Your Story”. The ad features a stuntman succeeding to become the model after using the brand. This changing story is changing the stereotypes of masculinity by putting prominence on men’s desire to be attractive where in a postmodern world they are not shy anymore about trying to look good, fair and handsome by using fairness creams.</p>
<p><strong>Metro-</strong><strong>Sexualizing Masculinity</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>For years, the Day Spas and Beauty Salon were a woman’s sanctuary with a man rarely in sight. They have always known the value of having a facial, a manicure or even a spray tan to help lift the spirits and make female feel good about them.  How times are a changing! The number of male visitors to day spas and beauty salons has been rising and these days, salons and spas appeal to men of all walks of life. Girls’ little secret are no more unknown to men. This is what Dennis Wong rather jocularly wrote in the online version of <em>Bloomer Businessweek</em>. In Mashrur Shahid Hossain’s words:</p>
<p>[T]his casual joke metonymies the nature, spirit and consequences of metrosexual masculine culture: The concept of masculinity is changed and queered, and metrosexuality has foregrounded male body beauty which has brought about a pattern of ceaseless consumption and increased masculine stress. (Hossain 16)</p>
<p>Bollywood stars Shahid Kapoor and Asin have been featured in an advert of “Clinic All Clear shampoo.” In this specific commercial roaming around the famous shopping malls and buying a brand new black suit even cannot provide the men the sense of perfection in grooming until having the confidence of wearing Black (which initially defines that in the background of black suit white dandruff flakes might be visible.) “Clinic All clear shampoo” gives this manly confidence promising zero dandruff claiming that this shampoo is the ‘license to wear black.’</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 4 </strong></p>
<p><strong>Androgynous Symptoms and Evidences</strong></p>
<p>Our society has always been shaped by the suggestions of the television advertisers who influence consumers’ belief on how people should look or act. In the past the advertisements in Bangladeshi media used to perpetuate the myth of two-and-only-two genders — a construct which used to exclude many. They had considered sex and gender as an inseparable entity where men were masculine and women were feminine. But interestingly consumer behaviour researchers recognized long ago that some men were more feminine than masculine while some women were more masculine than feminine. This realization leads the recent Bangladeshi media to reshape the consumer society with view to target everyone. The marketers are challenging the long-held norms and notions about what it means to be a man or a woman. In this new spectrum, there is no longer binary, people are encouraged to work out their own issues in order to talk about it, accept it, and move on.</p>
<p>The series of adverts that I have examined in chapter 3 are the first fruits of breaking the stereotype. Shahrukh Khan instead of assuming the tough and traditional masculinity, emerges as in a rather feminine posture of showering in a bathtub with rose petals and talking about his beauty secrets. Again the narcissistic, agile, stylish guy in the shampoo advert gives his best endeavor to hit upon the best suit which will make him look cool, fit and eye-catching. Following these advertisements men in Bangladesh are increasingly becoming conscious of their looks. They do not mind being full-throat by embracing traditional female interests like an overly vested interest in clothing, fashion accessories, hairstyles, manicures, spa treatments, neat eyebrows and so on—something that always been seen as a feminine trait. As Hossain explains—</p>
<p>If the 60s narrative cinema had invoked what Laura Mulvey called the ‘male gaze’ the spectacle of men in the fashion ads today invoke the ‘female gaze.’ Here are men to-be-looked-at and here are women to look at them, deriving aesthetic and scopophilic pleasure regardless of what the biological sciences and religious proclaim. (Hossain 16)</p>
<p><strong>Androgynous Culture in Bangladesh:</strong></p>
<p>Gender-roles are also immensely redefined and re-understood in these recent advertisements. For example, men are equally part of household domestic works like cooking, washing clothes or rearing children. Furthermore the dress code for today’s corporate world also rejects the gender binary. Blurring the fashion gender lines, the ability for men and women to dress down at work presents more options where unisex dress codes are more encouraged. Examining the genders massages in these adverts it seems Bangladeshi media is ‘applying all things to all people’ philosophy. This visual representation of masculinity palpably offers a negotiation between what is traditionally called ‘absolute feminine’ and ‘absolute masculine’. Dr Sandra Bem names this version of masculinity as ‘androgyny’ which is currently introduced in Bangladeshi media.</p>
<p>As explained earlier, an androgynous male is a more balanced person who is able to incorporate a high degree of both feminine and masculine traits. A “traditional” feminine individual is high on feminine (expressive) traits and low on masculine (instrumental) traits. A “traditional” masculine individual is high on instrumental traits and low on expressive traits. But an androgyny embraces both of them depending on which behaviors best fit in a particular situation which makes them better adjusted, consequently happier.</p>
<p>This inauguration of androgyny in Bangladeshi media has direct connections to changes in country’s consumer markets. Where gender has been a significant segmentation and targeting criteria in our local marketing, gender roles used to persist and influence consumer behavior, the behaviors of androgynous male consumers are now clearly defying these stereotypes. Keeping pace with the global trends Bangladeshi male are now updating their wardrobes, piling accessories and jewellery for different events, trying skin and hair care products to look appealing. Further boosted by male fashion magazines like <em>Canvas</em> and beauty contests like ‘You Got the Look’, men’s grooming now has a huge market in Bangladesh. To feed the men-grooming wave many stylish and expensive male beauty salons have been establish namely Persona Adams and Total Care. There is a well equipped gym in almost every corner of the capital, which shows how men are striving to obtain a good physique. Apart from the menswear, grooming products and toiletries, many grocery products are solely aimed at men with a persuasion to make family life easier.</p>
<p><strong>Androgyny and the Gay Consumers:</strong></p>
<p>On the heels of Dr. Bem’s theological revelation in 1974, the gay liberation movement embraced the idea of androgyny, for it allowed lesbians and gay men to show their gender characteristics openly in western societies. Though quite late, with the contemporary change in the role of gender in marketing efforts, Bangladeshi markets are also focusing on the gay communities as a distinctive market segment in their concerns. The fashion and modeling industries have emphasized on the distinctive value of gay consumers. Several marketing communication firms have emerged that specialize in understanding the gay market and major advertisers across an array of products are devoting increasing resources to target the gay market. Consequently, the prevailing wind for social changes started to sweep across the country, empowering women and softening the image of men, while altering the perception of human nature consisting of opposite sex roles to human nature unifying two complimentary sex roles as a legitimate gender. Its impact is one where the established masculinity is being destabilized not just at the “fringes” of society, but in mainstream lifestyle, media, fashion, and art. The traditional hegemonic masculinity version is therefore strongly alive in kicking the emerging ‘androgyny’ in both fabulous and stereotypical way.</p>
<p><strong>Reaction Towards Androgyny:</strong></p>
<p>It is interesting to see how masochist people are defensive in the face of these changes. Many of them fear that the moving up of androgyny is the inauguration of becoming woman as man are loosing their desired ‘ideal’ masculine traits. To them if nothing else, it shows the effect of willingly and deliberately led onslaught on strength of men and women. Now people aspire to become the other gender and remain detached from themselves; “When you can no longer tell a man from a woman, it is the end of the world.” Manipulating religious sentiments they claim that magnanimous God created man and from man, women to serve him. Blurring this distinction is against God’s plan for us and continuing society.  Their conversations about ‘androgyny’ finally strain transgender and wrap up with an apocalyptic account of gender ending.</p>
<p>I am always taken back by the audacious cis-privileged comments of anti-androgyny and oppositional sexism as a defense to the gender binary, a sentiment that even permeate within the transvestite community. It is factual that sex differences are authentic and a number of are most likely present at birth. Gender is also important to our identities, and it orients us in interacting with others. Theorists acknowledge that one byproduct of eliminating gender would be “gender vertigo,” an unsteady and vulnerable feeling. But I do not believe that this isn’t insurmountable. We would have to adjust and recover, but it would be worth it in the end. With the oppressive structure of masculinity gone, men will be freer. Refuting the hegemonic allegations Sean Nixon comments, “[It] is argued that there is no true essence of masculinity guaranteed by God or nature which we could appeal to in analyzing men’s gender identities. Rather, like all identities, masculinities are to borrow Jeffrey Week’s phrase, invented categories” (<em>Weeks</em> 1991). They are the product of cultural meanings attached to certain attributes, capacities, dispositions and form of conduct at given moments (Nixon 301).</p>
<p>Therefore I think ‘androgyny’ paranoia is not apocalyptic. Rather it is an escape from the pressure to conform in everyday life, largely as a result of prejudice or misconceptions, and is a welcome release.  An androgynous male does not negate all of those that clearly embody the binary. Differences do not “end” in gender, rather it broadens it. Gender is growing up and it is rapidly moving away from the previous limitations of the binary, in order to encompass a more genuine reality and understanding about the sexes. To achieve this understanding, neutral parenting is one of the most important lessons.  As for example, Kathy Witterick and her husband, David Stocker, are raising their 4-month-old child, Storm, without revealing the child’s gender. According to the birth announcement from the Toronto couple: “We’ve decided not to share Storm’s sex for now — a tribute to freedom and choice in place of limitation, a stand up to what the world could become in Storm’s lifetime. This couple accepted the gender rule-breaking appearances, action and identities. This gender neutral parenting is an encouragement for their child to be gender explorer rather than gender police. This child is not limited in his choices because of gender stereotypes and s/he does not have to grow up and limit other people (men and women) because of gender stereotype. Does stereotype really matters? In a country with the ideal of treating everyone fairly and equitably, do we really need to know if someone is a boy or a girl?  The discussion is not about creating a neutered “gender neutral” existence, rather, developing an acceptance for people living their chosen gender, loud and happy. Neither we can “make” our children anything nor can we really “stop” them from being anything in particular, either. But we can help them explore the fullest definition of who they are and try to accept it so that they feel good about whomever they discover themselves to be. It seemingly looks like Bangladeshi media is moving towards the familiarization of the idea of androgyny.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Media has proved itself as an effective tool to change the design of gender inequality in society. In terms of Bangladesh, today’s media is noticeably taking interest in exploring the various versions of masculinity. This endeavor is being strongly felt in every sphere of life. The term ‘androgyny’ has become a proverbial term to describe this phenomenon and it has been considered as a phenomenon because the hegemonic masculinity does not welcome variety in its stereotypic definition. Emotion, beauty, fashion and image enhancement have long been the province of women, yet it has become increasingly accepted for men to enter into the territory. And so, the purpose of the research was to identify the recent adverts widely run in various television channels in Bangladesh that contributed the media in promoting androgyny with a view to break the myth of rigid masculinity.</p>
<p>The upshots of this study indicate that this movement has a strong correlation with the consumer market. This is not surprising, considering the strong body of knowledge on the effects of media on male appearance ideals. Through these adverts, men are increasingly exposed to the glamour world telling them, “you don’t look good enough” (Pope 4). The importance of appearances is causing men to spend more money on grooming products and therefore, effective marketing through media is the key to attracting and retaining this growing demographic. The burring of gender roles in society is calling marketers to appeal to both male and female in uni-fashion and household responsibilities.  This is tied with the fact that women are working outside the home, and thus men’s role as provider in the breadwinner family is in a state of flux. But men are now subjected to be better fathers, better husbands who share an equal hand in domesticity. Therefore men are now defining themselves through what they consume and what they contemplate and their masculinity is reinforced through the media adverts they are barraged with. This has led men to re-conceptualize their masculinity. Further, because men are not given the discourse to talk about their feeling of inadequacy, they internalize their feeling, which appears to reveal the femininity—a stereotypically considered threat to their social-esteem. Thus, the increasing importance on promoting androgyny through the media now appears as a revolution which gives man space to celebrate their true self.</p>
<p><strong>Scope </strong><strong>for Further Stud</strong><strong>y:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The results of this study suggest that the future research regarding the role of media on promoting androgyny would be beneficial in understanding the various sexual orientations in Bangladesh. Feminine androgyny is still unexplored in this arena will come in focus. A link between the emergence of androgynous male and Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) is also an interesting avenue to explore, men with BDD are high consumers of image enhancing products. (Pope, et al., 2000)</li>
<li>Lastly this study attempted to determine a relationship between the androgynous and demographic characteristics. Although initial analysis showed a relationship did exist, the lack of representation in the sample did not allow for this relationship to be adequately determined. Perhaps a larger study of this relationship would better determine whether a relationship does in fact exist.</li>
<li>To conclude, the current representation of androgyny highlights this idea that masculinity is not fixed, rather it is plural social construct. The findings of the study indicate the important role of the media in re-conceptualizing masculinity, in this construction. Further research relating both of these variables to the contemporary identity of men as consumers and family man is essential as the stereotypic versions of masculinity has become superseded.</li>

22,"<h2 class=""blog_entry-title"">THE IMPACT OF TEXT MESSAGING</h2>","<div class=""entry-content"">
<div class=""featured-thumb"">
<a href=""#"">
</a>
</div>
<div class=""entry-content"">
<p>Text messaging had become one of the foremost means of communicating in society today. It certainly has its benefits—it’s quick, to the point, and instant. One can send off a text almost anywhere and anytime. It’s very helpful for making plans or sending a visual record for making plans (addresses or times to meet) and other exchanges of important information.</p>
<p>However, it has been found that texting can also be detrimental to relationships, especially when it is used as a primary form of communication. Many people have explained that it has actually created additional strain on their relationships, mostly because of the limits of texting communication triggering anxiety.</p>
<p>Misunderstandings, arguments or fights that have started or have been a result of texting usually must be resolved using either face-to-face communication or at the very least, a voice-to-voice phone call. With texting, because it is so impersonal (save the use of smilies, emoticons and clues like “LOL,” and tone like sarcasm or sincerity) there is so much potential room for misunderstanding—misunderstanding that might not happen if the communicators had been able to pick up on the lost social clues of voice inflection, facial expressions or body language.</p>
<p>Imagine the difference between an texted apology of “I’m sorry” to being told and seeing or feeling the sincerity in one’s eyes saying it. Some of the appeal of texting has been to actually avoid these situations that can be painful, but the pain is part of the process: “The complexity and messiness of human communication gets shortchanged. Those things are what lead to better relationships.”</p>
<p>Another problem that I can identify with texting is that often times it is intentionally used to be conversation-avoidant. Texting allows us to be impersonal and send quick messages that we might not otherwise communicate (i.e a quick “happy birthday!” instead of having to fake an enthusiasm you’re not really feeling). The issue lays in that many people are on-edge because they often do not know of the sincerity level of the sender, and everyone knows that it happens. This leads to an additional anxiety of how long it takes a person to respond, or even a lack of response may make the sender feel a form of rejection or avoidance.</p>
<p>Truth is, of course, sometimes people are not able to answer immediately or they may simply not feel like a response is necessary when the sender does. These types of anxieties of dealing with the unknown create additional insecure feelings in relationships.</p>
<p>When relying on texting for communication, the high risk of misinterpretation and the ambiguity within the concise messages. Facial expressions and vocal inflection are still the only ways to truly read emotion. While emoticons may help further express feelings, partners still need physical contact and quality interactions to maintain relationships.</p>

23,"<h2 class=""blog_entry-title"">THE INFLUENCE OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY ON SOCIETY</h2>","<div class=""entry-content"">
<div class=""featured-thumb"">
<a href=""#"">
</a>
</div>
<div class=""entry-content"">
<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
<p>While technology is often described as the most important influence upon society (ref), it remains a subject which deserves further study. This situation is generally accepted, with politicians, sociologists, industrialists and educationalists alike recognising that technology lies at the very heart of society (Chandler, 1996). The critical role that technology plays in the development of society, stimulating not only the economy but society’s socio-cultural values, rather than being merely a tool of society, however, is referred to as ‘technological determinism’ (Underwood, 2009). It is this aspect of how technology drives modern society that this essay addresses.</p>
<p>Social progress has come to be equated with technical progress, particularly since the Industrial Revolution (Beniger, 1989). This progress has not always been acknowledged at the time it was occurring; indeed, as Beniger further notes, ‘human society seems rather to evolve largely through changes so gradual as to be all but imperceptible, at least compared to the generational cycles of the individuals through whose lives they unfold’ (1989, p. 2). Perhaps because of this ‘historical myopia’, the value of the change may not be evaluated until the changes has already passed (Beniger, 1989, p. 2). Critics such as Henry David Thoreau, for instance, suggested that improvements in society’s technical means are no guarantee of improved ends, and that they may instead lead to a mechanistic and fatalistic outlook, positing that ‘we do not ride upon the railroad; it rides upon us’ (1845, p. 308). Thus, technology itself becomes an overriding preoccupation, for it never stops still.</p>
<p>Technological advancement seems important at the time to different ages in different societies, psychologically if not practically; in a variety of modern societies, for example, young people presently feel a heightened empathy with the digital age (Bennett and Maton, 2010). However, not all sectors of the community will be directly involved with, share an understanding, or even see the relevance, of the latest technological inventions. Nevertheless, as de Tocqueville (1990, p. xxii) noted in 1840, ‘this social revolution, which I believe to be irresistible… is already accomplished or about to be so’, and thus recognition of it is recognition of the past as much as the present. The current revolution in technology, known variously as the ‘Information Age’ or ‘Age of Technology’, similarly is unrelenting: the older person who is reluctant to use a computer has a life shaped by others’ use of computers and may even accept a basic mobile telephone, once considered a glamourous accessory (Coeckelbergh, 2012). As globalisation becomes an increasingly significant factor in countries’ economic success, technological competence is becoming an essential tool for surviving and thriving not only in society, but in its constituent parts, such as employment, education, agriculture, and industry.</p>
<p><strong>2. Advantages and disadvantages of modern technological progress</strong></p>
<p>The younger generation today, like many previous generations, seeks to change the world and make it a better and more comfortable place in which to live (Griswold, 2012). They want to be contributors to peace, economic reforms, the improvement of public services and many other aspects of the society. For them, the best way to contribute to these changes is through modern technology. (Weiser and Brown, 1997).</p>
<p>This does not necessarily mean that youth wants to make a huge change on the view of the world where they grew up, or that they just want to split away from the norms of society. Instead, they believe that the advances in communication, through technological means, will facilitate social change as no previous generation has had the opportunity to learn so much, so authentically, from one another (Griswold, 2012). The ability for real-time conversations, forums, information exchange, visualisation of other cultures, and greater social equality across the world has developed more in the last 20-25 years than at any other time in history. This has allowed commentary on situations as they develop, rather than purely through the perspective of written media. For example, the role of social media during the ‘Arab Spring’, not only through Twitter but Facebook and other social media platforms, provided contextualisation for the media reports at a time when media bias is increasingly critically examined (Khondker, 2011). Thus, this generation is able to confirm journalists’ interpretation of an event, even in film, with those who are participating on both sides of the event, as well as casual observers. This is unique in history.</p>
<p>The degree to which unfettered access to opinion, counter-opinion, reportage, and propaganda will truly reshape the world is yet to be determined. The Habermasian interpretation of the development of the public sphere holds some analogies, as the democratisation of critical analysis unfolded in fin-de-siècle Viennese coffee houses (Habermas, 1989).</p>
<p>According to di Maggio <em>et al.</em> (2001) extensive social ‘effects’, both optimistic and pessimistic, have been claimed for many communications technologies before our current computer-based age of information technology. The so-called I.T. revolution (which tends to be presented as the ‘final’ communications revolution) can be seen as having been preceded by the ‘writing revolution’ and ‘the print revolution’, and only the latest phase of an ‘electronics revolution’ which began with telegraphy and telephony. Winston (1998) criticises technological determinism and instead develops his theory of cultural determinism. In this theory, Winston considers not how technology shapes society, but rather that the evolution of technology, which is not static, is mediated and manipulated by society. Thus, as a result of these manoeuvres, the ‘radical potential’ of a specific technology is stifled; society therefore only accepts that which it believes itself to be in a position to accept (Winston, 1998). Systems and machines like computers, mobile phones and operating systems, which just involve one click on the computer, replace the things which used to takes hours or even days. Almost every home has a computer and telephone, and individuals within those homes often each have a mobile phone (Bennett and Maton, 2010). For some people, the application of technology is the only technique for them to develop patience, as even the tedious business of waiting can be ameliorated by keeping busy with a mobile phone, especially for youth.</p>
<p>One of the most important advantages of modern technology is globalisation, which has allowed the world to feel ‘closer’, and permitted the world’s economy to become a single, interdependent system (Barrell and Fic, 2014). This means that people can not only share information quickly and efficiently, but can also bring down barriers of linguistic and geographic boundaries.</p>
<p>Zhong (2007) observes that, in today’s stock markets, financial infrastructure, global news organisations, powerful militaries, strong governments and big corporations, instantaneous communication is an asset society cannot afford to lose. The internet allows interconnection and promotes globalisation and information sharing. The reduction in the cost of instantaneous communication over the last 20 years have considerably expanded its potential, by making it accessible to developing as well as developed economies.</p>
<p>However, modern technology does not bring advantages but some disadvantages as well. The similarity of lifestyles, whereby communication channels homogeneity, can have deleterious effects (Griswold, 2012). Before the rise of film, television, and the internet, people had different cultures and traditions that were reflected in the way they wear clothes or design buildings. Now, in a form of creeping conformity, people tend to build the same models of house and wear the same fashions.</p>
<p>The new, modern technology is excellent in many ways, but its philosophical, physiological, and psychological effects remain unknown in a period when technological interaction and live communication through computer use, internet chat, mobile phones, and SMS texts are part of the everyday life of -teenagers and the youth of today. This not only includes issues such as the debate on whether mobile telephones increase the likelihood of brain tumours, but the behavioural responses of children to ‘instant’ gratification, or whether mobile phone addiction will become a significant disability (di Maggio <em>et al.,</em> 2001). These are issues which remain unresolved; their resolution will not be immediate.</p>
<p><strong>3. The vision of teenagers in this day and age</strong></p>
<p>With the growth of technologies as the internet and computers, teenagers and young people are becoming more dislocated from society (Griswold, 2012). Isolation is one form of this problem. The Japanese phenomenon of <em>hikikomori,</em> whereby young people (commonly, males, and more increasingly, adults) sequester themselves, using only technology to keep in touch with society, is believed to affect almost two million people worldwide (Longo, 2010). Social interaction results in levels of stress and distress to the degree that individuals cannot cope, and seek refuge instead in an environment which they feel is fully within their control. Additionally, education is being transformed by technology. Stimulating students is not a matter of making a great speech or a dominant lesson anymore; educators need to be brought down to a teenager’s level of understanding (Weiser and Brown, 1997).</p>
<p>The need and wishes of modern youth are very different from those of their parents, as can be seen in <em>hikikomori</em> (Longo, 2010). The most inspiring tool for teens and their lifestyle is the internet, mobile technologies, and computers (Griswold, 2012. Teenagers and young people also have changed in comparison with teens in the past, taking into account eating habits, an active way of life, spending free time, and the importance of music and fashion. The affordability of many of these factors has changed considerably since, for example, the post-war generation (Bennett and Maton, 2010). The most important change, however, is that they are a “technology” generation. For teens in today’s world, mobile phones, internet, music, movies, television and video games are very important. Most teenagers prefer watching television and playing computer games to reading books. They dislike reading because watching television or playing online role-playing games is easier and they do not have to use their own imagination (Davies and Eynon, 2013). Computer games have the capacity to provide teaching opportunities but they are also harmful to health (Longo, 2010). Teenagers prefer to spend free time in front of a computer rather than to walk, play football, go to a swimming pool, or just simply meet a friend in the park and have a chat. The long term effects of these changes are not likely to be evident for at least three more generations.</p>
<p>According to di Maggio <em>et al.</em> (2001), the internet expands daily and reaches more and more people globally. As a society, improvements in literacy may rise due to the growth of the internet. The young generation cannot imagine their day’s homework without the support of the one of most important modern technological developments, the internet. The internet is very useful and an important tool for studies, as there they are able to see the latest reports and articles, find and practise exercises which are relevant to their studies, as well as submit assignments and other work.</p>
<p>Further, a teenager’s social life becomes inextricably linked to social networking, especially through live chat and Facebook. They would rather say that this is the easiest way to communicate with each other, as well as learning new things and having fun (Davies and Eynon, 2013). Many things can be done through the internet. Young people can download music and other files and play online games with their real or virtual friends. In this way, therefore,</p>
<p>the internet influences the teen view to the world and its future. It also gives them an opportunity to interact with other teens and discuss relevant issues. One important aspect of teens using internet is their freedom to post criticism of government leaders. Youths have limited abilities to communicate meaningfully with government as they cannot vote; the internet permits them to give their beliefs about what is wrong and what is right from their point of view, (Davies and Eynon, 2013).</p>
<p>On social websites youths can have relations and communication with their friends or just someone who is far away from their homes and around the world, chatting on the worldwide web, emailing or just playing games. This has been extended considerably with the advent of smart phones (Bennett and Maton, 2010). Using the internet teenagers can go shopping with their friends using the same website, use microphones or cameras to film themselves, nearly in the same way as they would go out together for real shopping.</p>
<p>Thus, the public sphere – through recreational chat as well as more complex interactions – is extended in the manner akin to that described by Habermas (1989).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this change to ‘life online’ means that, inevitably, many real world problems manifest themselves in the internet, and then have a further real world consequence. This can be seen in the phenomenon of cyber bullying. Cyber bullying targets the sexuality, physical attractiveness and friendships of children and teenagers (Davies and Eynon, 2013). Victims do not know what to do or where to turn. Cyber bullies harass victims anonymously. The psychological damage is horrific because the victim’s own peers have turned on them and there is nowhere for them to go, with teenage suicides and attempted suicides reported in the past (Griswold, 2013).</p>
<p>A ‘dis-connect’ from human reactions could contribute to cyber bullying. People learn to communicate mostly through text messages or online, and do not learn important aspects of human interaction, such as noticing and accepting non-verbal signals (Griswold, 2013). Without these signals and characteristics it is easy to be misunderstood and for the victim to be dehumanised (di Maggio <em>et al., </em>2001).</p>
<p>This is also true of online dating (Winston, 1998). People are normally aware of what someone is saying or not saying, through gesticulations and voice tones. Without these cues, it is difficult to appreciate how the other person is feeling and whether there is truly a connection. Youth can start to feel as if who they are is not recognised, that they are reviled or that nobody wants them, when for example the text message or email was simply not received.</p>
<p>Young people have created and developed a communication culture that incorporates many special features, such as a rise in the use of text-based communication channels (Davies and Eynon, 2013). Teenagers’ intersecting and selective use of communication channels has been shaped by multimedia communication (Weiser and Brown, 1997). Thus, their public sphere utilises a wider range of platforms than previously; nevertheless, it is still merely an extension of the public sphere, just as television and newspapers were (Habermas, 1989). Regardless of their form, the media landscapes created by teenagers serve to articulate their personal space, as well as enabling their presentation of self and defining their relationships to others).</p>
<p>This can be seen in young people’s relationship to the mobile phone and other forms of interactive technology, which is consistent with their general consumption styles. An “addictive” use of the phone has been related to “trendy” and “impulsive” consumption styles prevalent among females (Davies and Eynon, 2013). Technology enthusiasm and trend-consciousness was linked to impulsive consumption and “hard” values more prevalent among males (di Maggio <em>et al., </em>2001). In contrast, a frugal mobile phone use was not related to gender but to environmentalism and thrifty consumption in general. The traditional gender division in mobile phone use styles that could be observed is interesting in the light of conjectures that genders are becoming more alike in their use of new technology. The increasing trend towards ‘instant gratification’ that has been fed by high rates of credit over the last 30 years is exacerbated by an impatience facilitated by devices such as smart phones (Griswold, 2012). The net result of several of several generations for whom this is true has not yet been realised.</p>
<p><strong>4. Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Technology is one of a number of mediating factors in human behaviour and social change, which both acts on and is acted upon by other phenomena. Being critical of technological determinism is not to discount the importance of the fact that the technical features of different communication technologies facilitate different kinds of use, though the potential applications of technologies are not necessarily realised. Enthusiasm for technological ‘progress’ typically involves technological determinism. As Potter and Sarre (1974, p. 485), caution that, in reaction to the changes taking places amongst today’s youth, there is evidently an unmistakable tone of moral disapproval directed against cultural interval – that is, resistances to structural and normative adaptations occasioned by innovation’. This is not new. Every generation expresses concern for the pace and nature of change, and questions whether change is driving society or society desires the changes wrought.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the technological revolution will enable people’s lives to be easier, in ways such as social interaction, education, manufacturing, and so on. Withdrawing from the degree to which technology has shaped society will be very difficult, and likely to lead to large-scale economic chaos (Barrell and Fic, 2013). The rise in costs, for example, through slower communications or manual manufacturing methods, would result in an overwhelming, if temporary drain on the economy; nevertheless, given the decrease in fossil fuel availability, this may be a future that society needs to consider. Humans are highly adaptable, as the integration of change previously has demonstrated. There may be a social cost in this, as Thoreau (1854) speculated, but this flexibility has permitted societies of many different forms to flourish for millennia. The liberty for people discuss change, as Habermas (1989) has described, has expanded in the last three hundred years. Nevertheless, thinkers such as Thoreau and Habermas are prepared to question not only technological progress but change in its most elementary form. This is what will preserve humanity from self-destructive change.</p>
<p>Many people may feel that teenagers are unwittingly ‘walking into’ self-destructive change through their eager acceptance of technology in every aspect of their lives (di Maggio <em>et al., </em>2001). Whilst this may be a legitimate concern, it should also be borne in mind that teenagers are not merely being controlled by devices but are using devices to facilitate change – through social media. This was apparent during the ‘Arab Spring’ (Khondker, 2011), and was widely welcomed.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm for technological ‘progress’ typically involves technological determinism. As Potter and Sarre (1974, p. 485), caution that, in reaction to the changes taking places amongst today’s youth, ‘there is evidently an unmistakable tone of moral disapproval directed against cultural interval – that is, resistances to structural and normative adaptations occasioned by innovation’. This is not new. Every generation expresses concern for the pace and nature of change, and questions whether change is driving society or society desires the changes wrought. The human willingness to use change meaningfully and self-reflect, it is hoped, will protect society from itself.</p>

<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
<p>While technology is often described as the most important influence upon society (ref), it remains a subject which deserves further study. This situation is generally accepted, with politicians, sociologists, industrialists and educationalists alike recognising that technology lies at the very heart of society (Chandler, 1996). The critical role that technology plays in the development of society, stimulating not only the economy but society’s socio-cultural values, rather than being merely a tool of society, however, is referred to as ‘technological determinism’ (Underwood, 2009). It is this aspect of how technology drives modern society that this essay addresses.</p>
<p>Social progress has come to be equated with technical progress, particularly since the Industrial Revolution (Beniger, 1989). This progress has not always been acknowledged at the time it was occurring; indeed, as Beniger further notes, ‘human society seems rather to evolve largely through changes so gradual as to be all but imperceptible, at least compared to the generational cycles of the individuals through whose lives they unfold’ (1989, p. 2). Perhaps because of this ‘historical myopia’, the value of the change may not be evaluated until the changes has already passed (Beniger, 1989, p. 2). Critics such as Henry David Thoreau, for instance, suggested that improvements in society’s technical means are no guarantee of improved ends, and that they may instead lead to a mechanistic and fatalistic outlook, positing that ‘we do not ride upon the railroad; it rides upon us’ (1845, p. 308). Thus, technology itself becomes an overriding preoccupation, for it never stops still.</p>
<p>Technological advancement seems important at the time to different ages in different societies, psychologically if not practically; in a variety of modern societies, for example, young people presently feel a heightened empathy with the digital age (Bennett and Maton, 2010). However, not all sectors of the community will be directly involved with, share an understanding, or even see the relevance, of the latest technological inventions. Nevertheless, as de Tocqueville (1990, p. xxii) noted in 1840, ‘this social revolution, which I believe to be irresistible… is already accomplished or about to be so’, and thus recognition of it is recognition of the past as much as the present. The current revolution in technology, known variously as the ‘Information Age’ or ‘Age of Technology’, similarly is unrelenting: the older person who is reluctant to use a computer has a life shaped by others’ use of computers and may even accept a basic mobile telephone, once considered a glamourous accessory (Coeckelbergh, 2012). As globalisation becomes an increasingly significant factor in countries’ economic success, technological competence is becoming an essential tool for surviving and thriving not only in society, but in its constituent parts, such as employment, education, agriculture, and industry.</p>
<p><strong>2. Advantages and disadvantages of modern technological progress</strong></p>
<p>The younger generation today, like many previous generations, seeks to change the world and make it a better and more comfortable place in which to live (Griswold, 2012). They want to be contributors to peace, economic reforms, the improvement of public services and many other aspects of the society. For them, the best way to contribute to these changes is through modern technology. (Weiser and Brown, 1997).</p>
<p>This does not necessarily mean that youth wants to make a huge change on the view of the world where they grew up, or that they just want to split away from the norms of society. Instead, they believe that the advances in communication, through technological means, will facilitate social change as no previous generation has had the opportunity to learn so much, so authentically, from one another (Griswold, 2012). The ability for real-time conversations, forums, information exchange, visualisation of other cultures, and greater social equality across the world has developed more in the last 20-25 years than at any other time in history. This has allowed commentary on situations as they develop, rather than purely through the perspective of written media. For example, the role of social media during the ‘Arab Spring’, not only through Twitter but Facebook and other social media platforms, provided contextualisation for the media reports at a time when media bias is increasingly critically examined (Khondker, 2011). Thus, this generation is able to confirm journalists’ interpretation of an event, even in film, with those who are participating on both sides of the event, as well as casual observers. This is unique in history.</p>
<p>The degree to which unfettered access to opinion, counter-opinion, reportage, and propaganda will truly reshape the world is yet to be determined. The Habermasian interpretation of the development of the public sphere holds some analogies, as the democratisation of critical analysis unfolded in fin-de-siècle Viennese coffee houses (Habermas, 1989).</p>
<p>According to di Maggio <em>et al.</em> (2001) extensive social ‘effects’, both optimistic and pessimistic, have been claimed for many communications technologies before our current computer-based age of information technology. The so-called I.T. revolution (which tends to be presented as the ‘final’ communications revolution) can be seen as having been preceded by the ‘writing revolution’ and ‘the print revolution’, and only the latest phase of an ‘electronics revolution’ which began with telegraphy and telephony.

This is not new. Every generation expresses concern for the pace and nature of change, and questions whether change is driving society or society desires the changes wrought.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the technological revolution will enable people’s lives to be easier, in ways such as social interaction, education, manufacturing, and so on. Withdrawing from the degree to which technology has shaped society will be very difficult, and likely to lead to large-scale economic chaos (Barrell and Fic, 2013). The rise in costs, for example, through slower communications or manual manufacturing methods, would result in an overwhelming, if temporary drain on the economy; nevertheless, given the decrease in fossil fuel availability, this may be a future that society needs to consider. Humans are highly adaptable, as the integration of change previously has demonstrated. There may be a social cost in this, as Thoreau (1854) speculated, but this flexibility has permitted societies of many different forms to flourish for millennia. The liberty for people discuss change, as Habermas (1989) has described, has expanded in the last three hundred years. Nevertheless, thinkers such as Thoreau and Habermas are prepared to question not only technological progress but change in its most elementary form. This is what will preserve humanity from self-destructive change.</p>
<p>Many people may feel that teenagers are unwittingly ‘walking into’ self-destructive change through their eager acceptance of technology in every aspect of their lives (di Maggio <em>et al., </em>2001). Whilst this may be a legitimate concern, it should also be borne in mind that teenagers are not merely being controlled by devices but are using devices to facilitate change – through social media. This was apparent during the ‘Arab Spring’ (Khondker, 2011), and was widely welcomed.</p>

This is not new. Every generation expresses concern for the pace and nature of change, and questions whether change is driving society or society desires the changes wrought. The human willingness to use change meaningfully and self-reflect, it is hoped, will protect society from itself.</p>

<li>Getting a preserving specimen signature of a customer.</li>
<li>Taking initial deposits in cash.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>(i) Special types of account:</strong></p>

</ul>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The different types of clients mentioned above can open different types of deposit accounts. These deposit accounts have different features and phenomenon. The deposits that are taken by the Paba branch can be classified into two heads- Demand Deposit and Time Deposit.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This type of deposit is payable on demand. It includes current and savings account. The whole amount of current account and 16% of savings account is termed as Demand Deposit.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>(b) Time Deposit:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Time deposit is not repayable on demand. This is repayable after the expiration of a certain period. Time deposit is classified into four deeds namely- DPS, RPS, FDR and RGPS.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Formal agreement between a bank and borrower provide a fixed amount of credit for a specified period.” Timothy W Koch.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>5.2 Importance of Credit:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bank credit is very much important for socio-economical development of our country. Most of the people in our country are poor or marginal farmer. Bank credit makes possible for the financing of the agricultural, commercial and industrial activities of the nation. The importance of bank credit is also recommended as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">To produce capital goods which are used later in the production of consumable goods.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Bank loans also make possible production for inventory.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Availability of bank loans makes the farmer able to purchase seed, feed, fertilizer.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>5.3 Types of Credit:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As a partner of agricultural development, RAKUB generally deals with agro-base credit business. Credit is the main source to earn income. RAKUB, Paba branch provides three terms of credit:</p>

<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Warehouse credit</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Rural housing credit</li>

<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Agro mechanization credit</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Improved seed Credit</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Other tools machines credit.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>5.4 Overdrafts:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In the case of advances sanctioned by way of overdrafts, the customer is sanctioned a limit up to which he can overdraw his current account within a stipulated period. In case where the customer can not offer any kind of security excect his personal security, the facility is termed as a clean overdraft. On the other hand, where the customer offers a security acceptable to the bank facility is treated as a secured overdraft.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>5.5 Doubtful Loans:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Doubtful loans are those that are considered by bank examines to be doubtful of repayment, such loans are considered to contain some loss but the amount cannot be ascertained.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>5.6 Credit Management:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Lending is the one function of specialized banking. The successful banker is a successful lender. The tools used to manage lending are credit analysis, budgeting and supervision. Lending also has to be enlightened by a competitive but reasonable policy for interest charges on loans.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Banks are major financial institutions, which coordinate between borrowers and lender. They mobilize funds from one group of people at low rate and lend the same to another group of people at the highest rate of return to maximize profit. Unless the fund’s functions are efficiently planned and executed, the bank can not achieve its maximum potential profit. The specific objectives of credit management as well as the bank management in a specialized bank are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide service in special sector.</li>
<li>To maximize earnings.</li>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>5.8 Rate of Interest on Credit:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bank usually determines various rates of interest in different sectors. The rate of interest changes overtime and becomes effective from prescribed date. But rate of interest can not be changed when the disbursed loan is funded from the foreign aids. The variation of interest rate hinges upon credit program and tenure of the loan.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Chapter 06</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>6. Loan Disbursement</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>6.1 Introduction:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The strong base of RAKUB, Paba branch is totally dependent on sound investment. As interest on loan is the main source of income that is why qualitative loan disbursement is so much important as well as quality to increase total income of the bank.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>6.2 Loan Sanction Procedure:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Based on information available in the appraisal report or credit report, needs of the farmer client should be carefully analyzed by the sanctioning authority. Before approving sanction, analysis of status of application, credit worthiness, liabilities, project viability from technical, financial, economical and marketing and managemental point of view is important. As soon as the security is finalized and the sanctioning authority is satisfied, he should proceed for sanction of loan advance.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>6.3 Selection of Borrowers:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Borrower selection is an important factor for distribution of loan. The following factors  considered in selecting a borrower are as below:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""> Borrower must be Bangladeshi.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Borrower must be matured.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Borrower must have ability to repay the loan and he must be a possessor of goodwill in economic transaction.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Borrower must not be loan defaulter.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Borrower must be registered with Joint Stock Company if it is limited company.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Borrower must be registered with the register of the co-operative if it is a co-operative society.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Borrower must not be insane.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">4p may be mentioned in the loan selection procedure. Here 4p means:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">P=Person</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">P= Purpose</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">P= Profitability</li>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Source: RAKUB Paba branch, Rajshahi.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>6.5 Documentation:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After the loan or advance become effective, the manager should ask the borrowers promptly to comply with the loan covenants stipulations and execute the documents. Correct documentation is essential for securing safe repayment of loan and advances.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>6.6 Security:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">RAKUB maintains the security listed below in recovering the loans without risk:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>(i) Lien:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It’s a right to retain the property or goods of the borrower as security until the debit are adjusted. In this case the banker can only hold the possession of the goods but  he cannot sell them. A banker’s lien is a general hen. He can sell the securities under lien after giving reasonable notice to the borrower.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>(ii) Pledge:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Pledge is created only for movable property like goods, document etc. In case of pledge the ownership of the goods remains with pledge but the possession of the goods vests with pledge until the loan is recovered. Pledge does not occur until the goods are transferred. The pledged goods are returned to the owner after the loan is adjusted. If the borrower fails to repay the loan, the banker can sell the pledged goods after giving reasonable notice to him.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>(iii) Mortgage:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Only the immovable properties are kept under mortgage. It is a method of creating charge on immovable properties.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>(iv) Hypothecation:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hypothecation is nothing but the mortgage of movable property. It is an extended idea of pledge. In this case both possession and ownership remains with the borrower by the hypothecation agreement he has undertaken to transfer possession whenever required. Here the lender possesses the right of a pledge. Hypothecation is very much risky and RAKUB does not want to utilize this method for creating charges.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>6.7 Disbursement of Loan:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Before release of sanctioned loan or advance, all terms and conditions as laid down in the sanction letter are to be fully complied with. To that effect, the following basic requirements are needed:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Loan affectivity terms and conditions as to collateral security and equity of the borrower shall be fully met.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Specified documentations as specified in the sanction letter must be completed.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Verification of encumbrances of security properties:</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"">(i) Non-encumbrances certificate.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"">(ii) Execution of Halapnama.</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Creation of charge on the collateral security. In case of limited company, the charges on the company assets should be limited.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Within 21 days from the date of creation of charge, by registered post to the register, Joint Stock Company.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Insurance for:</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"">(i) Security properties, as applicable.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"">(ii) Assets create or to be created out of a loan fund or with two equity.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"">(iii) Stock of goods pledged with the bank as collateral shall be taken with appropriate risk cover.</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Any other stipulations as per sanction letter.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>6.8 Supervision and Monitoring of Loan:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Under its charter, the bank is required, as far as possible, to ensure that a loan is spent on the purpose for which it is made and if this requirement is not complied with by the borrower, the bank may require the repayment of the loan forthwith.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(i) Primary responsibility of the manager is to supervise and monitor the cash loan/WCL project and term loan stage by stage, ensure project constriction work, acquire kind items and project goods as per approved arrangement specified in the sanction letter.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(ii) Bank finance project should be inspected by the regional manager and manager periodically, to assess physical condition of the project’s facilities and the level of the project’s capacity utilization.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(iii) Cash loans are liable to misuse for non-productive process. Special attention must, therefore, by given on borrowers past antecedents when releasing cash loans.When substantial cash amount is required to be drawn by a borrower for civil works of a project, WCL for requiring goods, the managers must be particularly vigilant on the usage of loan. Total responsibility for credit super vision of cash credit/WCL lies with the manager.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(iv) The manager should deploy a project supervision officer after documentation is released of first loan installment with the assignment of overall project supervision. The duties of the PSO have been laid down in Ch: 25.07. The PSO should be stationed in the project site or nearby and see for himself the project developmental work and inform the progress to the manager through progress report predictably.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(v) After inspection, the manager/authorized officer should countersign the borrower’s acknowledgement receipt under his signature and seal. Only after such counter-signature in the borrower’s acknowledgment receipt, supplier’s bill can be processed for payment. The branch should complete the verification of goods supplied by a supplier within a week and process payment of supplier’s bill promptly when the same is in order.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Profile of Muslim Aid</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b> Introduction</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Muslim Aid is an international relief and development agency that works to alleviate suffering among the world’s poorest and most needy communities, regardless of race, religion, gender, nationality or political opinion. Set up in 1985, Muslim Aid currently supports projects in more than 50 countries around the world.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Working in over 70 countries across Africa, Asia and Europe, Muslim Aid is striving to help the poor overcome the suffering endured due to natural disasters and lack of life’s basic necessities.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We work with all in need, regardless of their race, religion, gender, nationality or political opinion.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Whilst responding to emergencies is one of our major priorities, we also work on strategic programmes to eliminate poverty that focus upon:</p>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li>Education</li>
<li>Skills training</li>
<li>Provision of clean water</li>
<li>Healthcare</li>
<li>Income generation projects</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">These projects ensure that individuals can have access to basic necessities and the skills <b>Performance of MuslimAid Bangladesh</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Emergency Response</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Over the year MABFO has implemented numerous emergency relief and rehabilitation projects for victims of cyclone Sidr and Aila as well as disaster victims all over Bangladesh. Muslim Aid with its own resources along with other institutional donors such as ECHO, UN-FAO, ROTA, WFP and UNICEF carried out emergency response as well as livelihood restoration projects mainly in Bagerhat, Patuakhali, Pirojpur, Barisal, Barguna, Satkhira and Cox’s Bazar. Immediate after cyclone Aila, MABFO provided 113,265 households from 5 Upazillas in four districts with food, drinking water, emergency medical treatment and cash for work.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As part of its rehabilitation effort, MABFO implemented two different types of shelter and WASH programmes in response to Sidr and Aila in partnership with ECHO. During the year 1,450 shelters (homes) were rebuilt, 3,150 shelters repaired, 1,250 sanitary latrines installed and 1,000 repaired. MABFO also undertook water purification and cash-for work programmes in Satkhira District for Aila victims. Pond Sand Filtering and deep tube wells were provided in Atualia, Burigualini and Propnagar Unions. A total of 750 vulnerable households got access to sanitation and hygiene facilities and 1,500 had access to safe water. Female bathing places were also constructed providing for an unmet need of the community.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">MABFO completed the first phase and started the second phase of a livelihood project for stateless unregistered Rohingya refugees at the Ledah site and some vulnerable members of the host communities living around the site in Nila Union in the Teknaf Upazilla in the south of the country. A total of 2,661 families received grants and skills training for small scale businesses, sewing, candle making and embroidery to enable them to become self-sufficient.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In partnership with UN-FAO MABFO provided 9,204 households received agricultural inputs, livestock, fishing boats and nets in 23 upazillas in the Khulna and Barisal Divisions. Working with WFP, MABFO provided 2,236 vulnerable households with nutritional support and 4,144 beneficiaries in Pirojpur received employment generation support.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">MABFO in partnership with Save the Children UK in a UNICEF-funded project provided training on education in emergencies for 200 schools in Bagerhat and Kurigram Districts to help them better face natural disasters.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In Teknaf in MABFO’s first partnership with the Qatar Foundation’s Reach Out To Asia (ROTA) MABFO provided Disaster Risk Reduction training to poor and vulnerable communities in the month of Ramadan. Participants received food support along with disaster preparedness training.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Non Formal Education</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Non-Formal Primary Education Programme-NFEP is an on-going programme in Rangpur District with 100 centers providing education for 3,200 underprivileged children who, due to poverty have never attended school or who dropped out of school. Over the year they have received basic education in Bengali, arithmetic, social science, Islam and life skills. At the end of 2010 they will be able to rejoin the formal system.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Skills Development Programme: Muslim Aid Institute of Technology (MAIT)</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Muslim Aid’s four Institutes of Technology (MAIT) in Dhaka, Jessore, Rangpur and Chittagong provide vocational training for poor, unemployed, unskilled, orphan, distressed youth; both male and female. Over the year a t total of 1,889 youth were enrolled with 1,820 graduating with an average attendance of 97%. At least 620 of the graduates are employed. Three new trades were opened including a four-year diploma course for computer and electrical trades in Jessore which will help achieve sustainability. The cost of the Chittagong MAIT has been covered by a US NGO – ECHO USA which has also contributed to the Dhaka MAIT.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Women Development Programme (WDP)</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Since its inception in 2006, the Women Development Programme (WDP) has been empowering underprivileged women from the Dhaka slums through developing skills such as sewing, embroidery, handicraft, and block batik with a market-oriented programme. They have been provided with employment assistance and most have been provided with post-training support in the form of sewing machines and other equipment to enable them to become self-sufficient… This programme is women headed with more than 95% female staff. Over the year 10 of graduated women have been employed in the production centre and 70 completed the training in sewing.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The programme has been able to overcome numerous challenges through restructuring, staff redundancy and increased income from sales of products through the Muslim Aid showroom. The whole programme is now located in the MAIT building to save costs</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Economic Empowerment</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Creating successful communities is at the core of all of our work. When responding to an immediate need we are already formulating a longer-term strategy that will enable people to look towards the future. We believe that economic empowerment is at the root of this.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Micro Finance Programme</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">MABFO’s Microfinance Programme is now covering almost 60,000 beneficiaries in 1,433 villages all over the country. The repayment rate is close to 100% and the clients have saved a total of Tk. 97.86 million. Loans disbursed totals Tk. 1,579.31 million with repayments totalling Tk. 1,191.86 million. The total loans with clients as at the end of the year was Tk. 387.45 million. The Muslim Aid funded microfinance programme is now self-sufficient and income from the small service charge covers the costs of running the programme. Having achieved sustainability Muslim Aid is now implementing a programme for the hard-core poor with zero service charge which is subsidised from the SME programme for those who have graduated from the Muslim Aid microfinance programme. It is unfortunate that of the budgeted £100,000 only £20,000 was received by the Field Office. The missing £80,000 would have enabled 1,600 families to escape from poverty. The children of all Muslim Aid beneficiaries are attending school and all families have adequate water and sanitation facilities which has been achieved by their improved economic situation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">MABFO is implementing a USD3 million agro-based micro finance programme called Fael Khair Programme for Sidr victims funded by the Islamic Development Bank (IDB). Muslim Aid is covering 389 Villages in the Sidr-affected Districts reaching almost 20,000 clients at the end of 2009 who have borrowed Tk. 240,71 million with repayments totalling Tk. 60.41 million. The total loan with clients at the end of the year was Tk. 180.29 million. Muslim Aid is contributing the administration costs for this programme under an MOU with the IDB.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Health Programme</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">MABFO runs three small hospitals located at Pabna, Kalura, and Pirajpur with mother and child clinic at Mirpur in the Dhaka slums as well as a satellite clinic at Juri in Malvibazar. Under an MOU with the Balagonj Foundation Muslim Aid is supporting a hospital at Balagonj which was originally funded by Muslim Aid but due to a difficult location it has now been handed over to the Foundation. All hospitals have in and out-patient services but the clinics in Dhaka and Juri have only out-patient services.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Over the year 57,663 patients received out-patient services and 3,201 received in-patient service with diagnostic services being provided to patients. The total expenditure of those hospitals and clinics was £153,332 over the year and £137,699 as income.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Mother and Child Care centre located in the Dhaka slums is a subsidised project to help underprivileged slum mothers and children. Most of the funding for this project comes from ECHO-USA.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>WASH Pogramme</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">MABFO’s water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programme helps poor families have access to safe, reliable and sustainable drinking water which is a problem in Bangladesh due to increasing salinity due to global warming as well as pollution by arsenic. Muslim Aid also helps proved sanitation which helps prevent disease. Muslim Aid’s programme is holistic approach incorporating hygiene promotion and education as well as ensuring access to sanitation and safe water services.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Over the year MABFO implemented safe water and sanitation programme at Lalmonirhat, Kurigram, Gaibandha and Pabna districts along with the installation of 315 tube wells such as shallow tube wells, semi deep and deep tube wells in different parts of Bangladesh. Over the year approximately 12,175 beneficiaries directly benefited from this programme. A total of 1,325 sanitary latrines have been installed for the poorest households in northern Bangladesh.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Other Events</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Snowdon Challenge</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">50 brave Muslim Aid supporters, including staff and volunteers, climbed Mount Snowdon on 14th March 2008 and raised £21,414 for projects in Gaza.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Fundraising Outlets</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">At the beginning of 2008, Muslim Aid planned to establish 3 fundraising outlets in Canada, Malaysia and UAE. However, following the decision of the EC, it was decided to put the opening of the new overseas offices on hold.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Partnerships</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In 2009 Muslim Aid continued to build the strength of existing partnerships and showed great resource and determination in forging new partnerships with international development agencies and funding bodies. Networking efforts both from the UK and our field offices led to increased relationships with institutional funding bodies and important UK and international bodies.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· <b>Humanitarian Accountability Partnership (HAP International)</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">HAP is an initiative which seeks to address accountability concerns towards survivors of disasters and aims to promote good accountability practices for its members. HAP offers certification based on certain standards and against six bench mark criteria relating to an organization’s practices and policies. The majority of all major non-governmental organizations are members of HAP and HAP certification is often essential for donor agencies. Muslim Aid joined HAP in early 2008 at a time when the organization was seeking improvement in accountability and good practices in management functions. As a pilot scheme, Muslim Aid is focusing on benchmarking the HAP standards in two field offices: Bangladesh and Indonesia. HAP membership reinforces commitment to establishing good practices for beneficiary accountability. In the past year, Muslim Aid has made notable progress in understanding and producing policies and practices which ultimately improve the quality of work. Specific examples of assistance from HAP include training and other technical support in Bangladesh and Pakistan in order to meaningfully practice and integrate good accountability practices with humanitarian programmes and a HAP-sponsored HQ-based baseline analysis completed at the end of 2008. MABFO Bangladesh humanitarian accountability practices have been used as examples of good practice in HAP training programmes.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· <b>European Commission Humanitarian office (ECHO)</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Muslim Aid obtained the Framework Partner membership of ECHO in 2007 and to date has received five grants for Muslim Aid Bangladesh Field Office worth of €2,366,000 as emergency grants allocated for the Cyclone Sidr Emergency (€300,000), Cyclone Sidr Shelter Project (€520,000), Cyclone Sidr Livelihood Project (€300,000) and Rohingya Livelihood Project (€246,000). Two other projects are ongoing: the 2nd phase of the Cyclone Sidr Shelter Project (€700,000) and the 2nd phase of Rohingya Stateless Unregistered Refugees Livelihood Project (€300,000). ECHO funded projects are being regularly audited by the ECHO-contracted UK based audit company Littlejohn as part of their process of reviewing the partnerships. ECHO has assessed Muslim Aid’s technical capacity i.e. its internal control system, organizational procedures and financial solidity as well as its procurement rules and procedures. It is a significant achievement that Muslim Aid has been upgraded from ‘A’ control mechanism to ‘P’ control mechanism which means that ECHO has accepted that Muslim Aid’s capacity and procedures are sufficiently robust so as to allow it to follow its own procurement procedures.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· <b>UNOCHA</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Muslim Aid Iraq field office established a partnership with UN-OCHA in 2008. OCHA granted £175,850 to Muslim Aid in July 2008 to implement an emergency project under a food security programme targeting 2,100 IDP families and the host communities in Baghdad &amp; Anbar Governorates. The project period was from August to October 2008. Training sessions, need assessments and field surveys were delivered by local partners and food and non-food items were delivered to all beneficiaries.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· <b>GlobalMedic</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">GlobalMedic DMGF is a registered Canadian charity and international NGO that uses its operational arm, GlobalMedic to run capacity building missions in post conflict nations and to provide disaster relief services to large scale catastrophes around the world. Muslim Aid and GlobalMedic entered into a formal agreement in 2007 and in 2008 Muslim Aid managed to distribute medicines and water purification tablets in a number of countries. The value of GlobalMedic’s contribution to Muslim Aid projects was over £5 million.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· <b>United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR</b>)</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A successful operational partnership was formed with UMCOR in the field in Sri Lanka in response to the Mutur crisis in 2006 which was formalised by the signing of a global partnership in June 2007 at the Houses of Parliament. In 2008 UMCOR contributed towards Muslim Aid’s work in Myanmar and Gaza as well as in rebuilding schools and providing support for school children after the Sidr Cyclone in Bangladesh. In 2009 UMCOR provided $10,000 for the support of the victims of Cyclone Aila. In addition UMCOR provided $100,000 to cover the construction of 200 shelters and latrines in Myanmar and $50,000 to support Muslim Aid’s work for the provision of clean drinking water in Gaza. Muslim Aid’s Acting Country Director in Indonesia had two meetings with UMCOR’s Head of Mission and Coordinator in Banda Aceh to explore future collaboration. It was proposed that UMCOR should undertake community needs assessments by conducting PRA (Participatory Rural Appraisal) exercises involving graduates/students in field activities before submitting joint proposals to UNDP in December 2008.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· <b>People in Aid</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In August 2008 Muslim Aid signed up to be members of People in Aid’s standards of good practice as a requirement for DEC Membership. People in Aid was established by agencies in the relief and development sector in 1995 and is a not-for-profit membership organisation. People in Aid is a global network of development and humanitarian assistance agencies which assists organizations whose goal is the relief of poverty and suffering to enhance the impact they make through better management and support of staff and volunteers. People in Aid respond to the needs of members and the sector by acting as an information exchange on good human resources and people management practice, by facilitating networking, by providing resources, by undertaking research and by answering queries.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· <b>DfID</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">2008 saw the continuation of Muslim Aid’s good working relationship with the UK government’s Department for International Development. A DfID-hosted iftar for Muslim Aid donors was held in Newham, attended by Shahid Malik MP and was preceded by a meeting at Newham school with Shahid Malik MP and Stephen Timms MP about the challenges of tackling global poverty. A concept note was submitted to DFID Development Awareness Fund for Love Water Love Life 2-year project to work with the Arabic-speaking communities of London. In April 2008 Muslim Aid started working on a DFID-funded £30,000 project, Education Really Matters, to establish a pen-pal scheme between approx 100 students in Islamic schools in London and Rainbow Family children overseas.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· <b>Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC</b>)</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Muslim Aid submitted its membership application to the DEC in August 2008. A meeting was subsequently held between the Chair and the DEC Board in October 2008 and the DEC decision letter was received on 31st October 2008. The only criterion on which Muslim Aid’s application fell short was that the organization could not demonstrate having spent £10 million per year for 3 consecutive years on disaster and emergency (D&amp;E) delivery. This was partly because 2008 was the first year that Muslim Aid had produced consolidated accounts and also because so much of the organization’s D&amp;E work does not fall within the DEC definition of D&amp;E but is seen to be “medium term response”. Muslim Aid’s position will be reviewed in line with the DEC’s stipulated criteria and a re-consideration of the application will be requested when Muslim Aid can fulfill all of the necessary criteria.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· <b>Crisis Action</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Membership of Crisis Action, a campaign group which focuses on situations of conflict and allows members to participate at an appropriate level in joint advocacy work, continued in 2008. Muslim Aid’s membership enabled staff to become familiar with the views of other member NGOs and staff attended various advocacy meetings facilitated by Crisis Action.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· <b>BOND</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Muslim Aid’s membership of the largest network of UK based NGOs working in international development continued in 2008. The organization attended many meetings. For example, Desk Manager Qasim Ahmed attended working groups on funding and disaster risk reduction in February 2008. Muslim Aid’s BOND membership was further utilized for trainings, consultation and advocacy.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· <b>Other UN Bodies</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Muslim Aid has strong relationships with UNDP, UNCIEF, WFP, UNHCR and UN-Habitat in Somalia and Indonesia. In Bangladesh Muslim Aid is working UNDP and UNESCO. With the FAO, and WFP on MABFO is working on livelihood, food security, and employment generation activities and Disaster Risk Reduction with UNICEF. In 2008, we worked to build these relationships in other countries of operation and were successful in securing some funding which is reflected in the finance section of the report.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· <b>Oxfam</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Muslim Aid worked together with Oxfam in 2008 to collaborate on communications and fundraising support and events. Muslim Aid hosted visits from the Finance and Donations teams and Communications and Fundraising in February 2008 and the Sunset Walk took place in September 2008.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· <b>Helping Hands:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Helping Hand for Relief and Development is a global humanitarian relief and development organization responding to human sufferings in emergency and disastrous situations anywhere in the world regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, class, location, religion, colour, cultural diversity and social background; with special focus in countries where a massive proportion of the population is living below the poverty line such as Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Kenya and Sudan. They also work with partners ranging from small community support groups to national alliances and international networks seeking education for all, justice and action against poverty, class and gender discrimination and natural calamity. Helping Hands has been supporting Muslim Aid’s activities for a number of years through Ramadan and Qurbani programmes and also emergency response.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· <b>IHH</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Foundation for Human Rights and Freedom and Humanitarian Relief (IHH) is a Turkish organization, established in 1995. Their aim is to provide support to individuals who are distressed, victimized by war, disaster, wounded, disabled, homeless, subjected to famine or oppressed. It is IHH’s main objective to deliver humanitarian aid to all people and take necessary steps to prevent any violations against their basic rights and liberties. In 2008 IHH supported Muslim Aid during Ramadan and Qurbani programme.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· <b>World Bank/Multi Donor Fund</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Muslim Aid Indonesia was awarded a grant for the Emergency Rehabilitation of the Drainage System for the Central Business District of Banda Aceh by the Multi Donor Trust Fund through the World Bank in 2006. This marked the first partnership between Muslim Aid and the World Bank. In 2009 the implementation of the $4.5 million project continued.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· <b>Asian Development Bank (ADB)</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">ADB is an international development finance institution, established in 1966 and based in Manila. ADB is owned and financed by its 67 members, of which 48 are from the region and 19 are from other parts of the globe. ADB’s main partners are governments, the private sector, nongovernment organizations, development agencies, community-based organizations, and foundations. Due to its positive performance, in 2008 Muslim Aid was one of seven agencies selected from among over 100 agencies operating in Aceh to manage some of the ADB-financed housing programme in Aceh. The project was designed to construct 656 houses and by the end of 2008 the construction was 95% complete. This was the first time Muslim Aid received financial support from ADB and the quality of the construction was appreciated by ADB monitoring teams and by the community. In a survey conducted among beneficiaries, Muslim Aid houses were adjudged to be among the top five in quality from 175 agencies building houses in Aceh.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b> To communicate effectively</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">By realizing this objective, Muslim Aid aims to:</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Integrated Income Generation Programme (IIGP) </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Introduction </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The programme was started in 2007 designed to generate income for Muslim Aid. In the beginning of 2009, there were 2 ongoing projects of IIGP located in the districts of Rangamati Hill and Dinajpur – having some 36 Acres (increased to 48 Acres by Dec.2009) and 6.3 Acres of land respectively; suitable for agriculture. The Rangamati one, locating at MainiMukh of Langadu Upazilla – is a tripartite project with Rabitat Al Alam Al Islami (Land owner), Ibn Sina Trust and MABFO. The Dinajpuir project is owned by MABFO. But from April 2009, another project (Third Project) was started at Rangamati dealing with Poultry Production on rented Sheds.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The idea of IIGP was to adopt environment friendly art of technology for Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Fisheries, Poultry and Horticulture under Integrated approach to maximize land utilization. Dissemination of the technique is one of the targets so that the ultra poor / grass root farmers could uplift their livelihood getting self-sustained.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b> Literature Review Brief</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Since Muslim Aid Bangladesh (MAB) is committed to serving humanity through the Muslim Aid HQ-which has Global network of volunteering and providing nonprofit activities to help the distress, underprivileged and helpless people of the world; they have the scope to look forward utilizing the technological assistance rather than just providing ‘Cash and Kind’ helps that they are proving to the poor people.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">So, giving emphasis to the Agro Based sectors Muslim Aid could do a lot and help huge numbers of people getting self-reliant and getting well-to-do status in the society in a sustainable way -by utilizing Integrated Culture Approach (ICA).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Another important idea is that Muslim Aid could start creating self generated local or country fund by selling the products to the consumers not only in Bangladesh but also in many other countries of the world. These funds would again be utilized to the Humanity and for the betterment of the poor in an accelerated way.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In a nut shell, Integrated (ICA) approach means to utilize the same unit of invested money in MULTIPLE times enabling reduced investment cost in the same ground or area – where by-products of one items helps to produce another products also.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The global mission of Muslim Aid is to alleviate the sufferings of the poorest and it complaints to millennium development goals (MDGs) at international level and poverty reduction strategy papers (PRSP) at national level. IIGP being a multi disciplinary agricultural development project fulfils the partial need of PRSP as well as MDGs. Poverty reduction, creating employment opportunity and branding for Muslim Aid are designed to be one of the final outcomes of the programme.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As regards to funding it was designed that, after spending the required seed money- the income generated from these projects would be utilized to fund various development programs of MABFO.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A fourth project is under process of getting Bilateral agreement with Rabita at Ramu (some 6+ Acres), under Cox’s Bazar District.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In addition to create Fund, in this year min. 5,000 families were directly benefited by getting job in this MABFO program. Indirectly, lot of root level farmers are coming and getting informal orientation on the techniques we apply – so IIGP is doing some extension and <a name=""OLE_LINK1""></a>dissemination of low cost innovative techniques also. Notable that, the BDR Camp Commanding Officer himself came to visit our project and in 2009 bought 10,000 Pine Apple saplings for their camp from our Maini Mukh project. We are going to supply more to them in 2010. They are interested to buy Banana sapling and Poultry also from us. This is a success of marketing our products.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">At Maini Mukh Project of Langadu Upazilla of Rangamati – IIGP, Muslim Aid has become the Key Poultry items’ Supplier dealing with some 13,000 Layer and Broilers birds. Since 2009, we were only selling poultry eggs and flesh (both Broilers and Cocks) – but now we have also started to supply Laying Hen (Pullets) and poultry feed also in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In 2009 we have already crossed the breakeven point although it was planned to be in 2011.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This year the 3 IIGP projects received total fund of Tk. 2725, 000/= but they have made expenditures of Tk. 7015,170/= utilizing their fund. (Payment is 257% than received). In Addition to that we have TK. 721,576/= as CASH In Hand and Bank. IIGP have Saleable (Tk. 1400,000/= in Jan &amp; Feb only insha Allah) and on top of that IIGP have Fixed Assets &amp; Tangible assets (birds, Goats, Trees, Fruits on tree/plants) amounting some Tk. 15,427,170/=. Where as, IIGP received in total of Tk. 6746, 068/= in three years from Muslim Aid UK.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Nearly 5,000 labours were engaged in this period in the projects and</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">a) 500 small farmers oriented on integrated model of agriculture, horticulture, fishery and livestock</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">b) 500 small traders in the local markets developed with the quality products of the projects</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">c) 1000 individual consumers organized and oriented with the use of firm products and by-products</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">d) 5000 day labourers got year round income by working in the firms giving emphasis on gender balance projects – where nearly 55% ware female members.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The egg market of the MainiMukh &amp; Langadu Thana is occupied by IIGP, MABFO.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The BDR camp is under agreement with MainiMukh project to buy eggs for 6 months.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The BDR camp has purchased 10,000 Pine Apple Sapling and IIGP is providing technical support to them also.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Cultivated Area:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Habluhat Integrated Rural Development Project (HIRDP), District -Dinajpur has 6.3 acres of land owned by Muslim Aid.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Mainimukh Integrated Rural Development Project (MIRDP)-Joint venture with Rabitat Al Alam Al Islami, Ibn Sina Trust, in the Rangamati Hill District starting in 2007 with 23 acres of land and water area – in 2009 we have extended the cultivated area to 48 acres income generating activities.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Results Achieved during the reporting period</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Projects in brief: </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Around 90 percent (nearly 48 Acres) of the suitable of hill-slope land area of MainiMukh project has already been converted to the area under productive farming practices- whereas 100% of Habluhat project is now being under integrated culture practice. Until now some 40 varieties of culture items were practiced from which we are going to restrict within only the highest profit earning items in future.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Deliverables </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">More than 45 types of different agro-fisheries-horticulture and animal husbandry based items were cultured in the 3 projects, such as (1) Fisheries, (2) Goat rearing, (3) Cattle fattening, (4) Poultry Farming, (5) Duck rearing, (6) Geese rearing; cultivation of (7) Paddy, (8) Maize, (9) Wheat, (10) Potato, (11) Chilly (Green Paper), (12) Ginger, (13) Turmeric, (14) Mustard, (15) Papaya (16) Egg Plant, (17) Arum, (18) Banana, (19) Mango, (20) Olive, (21) Pine Apple, (22) Sesame, (23) Pump-kin, (24) Water Melon, (25) Long bean, (26) Corolla, (27) Cucumber, (28) Radish, (29) Snake Gourd, (30) Carrot, (31) Sweet Gourd, (32)Cucumber, (33) Gourd, (34) Ladies Finger etc. Plantation of (35) Betel Nut, (36) Coconut, (37) Mahogany (38) Neem, (39) Bamboo bush, (40) Gamari, (41) Debdaru, (42) Acacia (43) Cane tree, and Other (44) seasonal leafy vegetables and (45) spices items.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Technical backstopping for sustainable land use planning and practices was given emphasis. Learnt that, in next year we would not go for all these, but limit to the most profit earning items only.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Motivation meetings with the stakeholders were fruitfully conducted for getting two way exchange of experience and prospect sharing.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Seed capital investments to the projects were targeted to maximise in spite of fund constraints by recycling the income from products sales of the projects.</p>

27,"<h2 class=""blog_entry-title"">THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO A MUSLIM WOMEN TO RECOVER DOWER</h2>","<div class=""entry-content"">
<div class=""featured-thumb"">
<a href=""#"">
</a>
</div>
<div class=""entry-content"">
<p>The right to dower is an inherent right of every Muslim wife. Under Muslim law, following means of enforcement of the right to dower are available to a wife (or widow):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Refusal of Conjugal Rights</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before consummation of the marriage, the wife is entitled to deny cohabitation to the husband till he gives her Prompt Dower on demand. A Muslim-wife can refuse to live with her husband and refuse to him the sexual intercourse so long as the Prompt Dower is not paid to her.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enforcement of Dower as Debt</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Where the marriage has been consummated, the wife cannot enforce her claim by refusing conjugal rights to the husband. In such a situation the wife can recover her unpaid dower by maintaining an action in a court of law. She may realise it from husband in the same manner as a creditor recovers his loan.</p>
<p>If the husband dies, the widow is entitled to recover the amount by filing a suit against the legal heirs of the deceased husband. But the legal heirs of the husband are not personally liable to pay the dower. The dower is a debt against the estate of the deceased husband which is inherited by heirs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Widow’s Right to Retention</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A widow, whose dower remains unpaid, has a right to retain the properties of the husband till her dower debt is satisfied, whether there is any agreement between the parties for this right or not.</p>
<p>Under this right if a wife has taken possession of her husband’s properties lawfully (with free consent of the husband) in lieu of unpaid dower, then she is entitled to retain that possession after the death of her husband, until her dower is paid out of the properties retained by her.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>The research has been carried out to find out the future prospects of the knitwear industry, its opportunities and threats</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Executive Summary</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The research has been carried out to find out the future prospects of the knitwear industry, its opportunities and threats. This would be used by the Corporate Banking division of Citibank N.A. to review their Vendor Marketing Program, as to what extent the knitwear sector should be incorporated into the program.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The knitwear industry has been faring really well in the post-MFA era. It has posted over 35 percent increases in exports in the first quarter of 2005 compared to the same quarter last year. All the firms surveyed had huge increases in exports compared to the same period of the previous year. BKMEA is surpassing the government set export target in the current fiscal year, with total exports predicted to exceed US$ 3000 million. The trend analysis carried out shows that by the end of the year 2007-2008, the export value could reach over US$ 5000, with the total number of knitwear firms likely to exceed the 1000 mark.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">GSP facilities, cheap labour, backwar linkage, less lead time and the industrialization of the RMG sector in the past years have been the strengths of knitwear sector as indicated by the responses of the experts and owners. GSP facilities have enabled the knitwear sector to capture the European market. The GSP revision would allow Bangladesh to benefit even more, as in addition to the present duty free status, will also become free from complying certain minimum local value addition requirement. It has been however, hindered to certain extent due to low productivity, outdated equipment and over-priced yarn, high interest rates and concentration only on a few markets.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There cumulative scores for opportunities have exceeded that of the threats, with the average score given by each expert being 2.33 higher than the threats (in a score of 5). This was because the removal of quotas in the post-MFA would allow the segment to explore into more markets, namely the US. Moreover restrictions imposed on China by the EU and the US is likely to shift buyers towards countries like Bangladesh. China itself may outsource to Bangladesh as it produces lower valued items and cannot meet its local demand.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">India is becoming the biggest threat to our knitwear sector, as it has huge incentives for the manufacturers and produces its own cotton, therefore lowering the cost of production almost 25 percent with similar valued items. On the other hand, owners of the knitwear factories in Bangladesh had to buy local yarns at higher price and buyers were stated to switch even for a price edge of 1 percent. To add to that, cash incentives had been stalled and BKMEA has urged for at least 15 percent cash incentives to keep up the competitiveness of the knitwear sector.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To keep up the growth of the sector experts in the sector have called for marketing improvements (forward linkage), cash incentives from the government, penetrating the US market (knitwear is focused in the EU market), and reducing the cost of production by ensuring lower priced yarns and lower interest rate.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If the knitwear sector continues to grow in the present manner, it is likely to come up as the major export earner of the country. Moreover the growth is likely to support the backward linkage industries like textiles and the dying industries. A combined effort is needed from the private sector as well as the government to keep up the trend in the global competition.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b> Introduction</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>1.1 Background</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With the integration of MFA into GATT, Bangladesh is bound to experience a few changes. These changes are likely to take place at various levels in various forms. One of the changes has been the rise in the export of knitwear of Bangladesh. Keeping this in mind and for the requirement of the VMP Program of Citibank’s Corporate Banking, a research has been conducted which studies the impact of quota withdrawal on the Knitwear section of the RMG industry.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The initial secondary research process had identified that the even though the quota phase out may cause the RMG industry to face certain difficulties, the knitwear section is likely to have a greater rate of growth in the post-MFA era. Hence, the problem statement for this paper is,</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>“Post MFA will see a significant rise in the growth of knitwear industry”</b>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>1.2 Objectives</b></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>1.3 Scope</b></p>
<ol start=""1"" style=""text-align: justify;"" type=""1"">
<li>The survey sample frame is limited to the factories situated in Dhaka. This excludes those located inside the EPZ and in other places like Chittagong.</li>
</ol>
<ol start=""2"" style=""text-align: justify;"" type=""1"">
<li>The factories surveyed either manufacture knit garments only or both woven and knitwear. This is because the research deals with the effect on the export of knitwear garments only.</li>
</ol>
<ol start=""3"" style=""text-align: justify;"" type=""1"">
<li>Only the effects of the three months in the post MFA period have been studied. Hence, other factors that may arise after the period has not been considered.</li>
</ol>
<ol start=""4"" style=""text-align: justify;"" type=""1"">
<li>The report is restricted only on the prospects of knitwear industries and only a small study has been done regarding impact on Citigroup The project was assigned only to find out the prospect of knitwear industries.</li>
</ol>
<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">RMG <i>are mass-produced finished textile products of the clothing industry.</i></h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>1.4 Methodology</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>1.4.1 Type of study</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The study took place in two stages. In the first phase exploratory research has been undertaken to gain better understanding of the dimensions of the problem. This research was carried out by going through secondary research materials. I have also spoken to Mr. Abdus Samad Azad, Senior Research Executive, BKMEA, to get the appropriate picture of the situation and also to prepare the questionnaire.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The second phase of the research involved a descriptive research. The study tried to find out the effect on the knitwear industry after January 1, 2005, and the opportunities that are coming up. To analyze this, an intensive research was made. The techniques and results of the result are presented in this report.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>1.4.2 Intent of study</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The intention of this study is to determine the extent of impact on the knitwear industry after the MFA has been lifted. It looks at the impact from the perspective of the industry and the perspective of the owners. The economic impact has been focused on, as the study was carried out with the instructions of the Head of Corporate Banking, Citigroup to analyze the opportunities of the bank to take part in the process.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>1.4.3 Definition of population</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For the purpose of the research, two sets of population have been considered. The first set consists of experts. They are mainly those people who have carried out or are carrying out researches on the RMG sector and are in a position to know the actual situation prevailing in the industry.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The second population set consists of owners of knitwear garments. While there are a total of 848 knitwear garments in the industry, the number of owners is much less because one factory owner usually has one or two more, especially if it’s a large firm.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>1.4.4 Sample design &amp; technique</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A non-probabilistic sampling technique was used to collect respondents for its survey purposes.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For the first sample frame, convenient sampling was used to pick its respondents. This was the only the respondents could be collected as majority of them have a busy schedule and often can not spare time. Some respondents chosen for the purpose like Mr. Kutubuddin Ahmed, Present Chairman of MCCI &amp; Former President of BGMEA, and Mr. Fazlul Haque, President of BKMEA could not give the time needed. Hence through convenience sampling the following people have been interviewed:</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Various analysis techniques have been used to analyze data in order to fulfill the objectives of the report. Some of these techniques are described below:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Trend analysis</b> – This was used to find out the extent of growth in the number of firms and the volume of exports of the knitwear industries in the post MFA era. The trend was created using the data of the knitwear growth of the first quarter of the year 2005.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Frequency –</b> Frequency tables are used quite a number of times in this report, e.g. to identify reasons behind the growth of individual firms. It allows the reader to easily understand the rate of recurrence of a particular option. Using this technique we were able to identify the reason most likely to have affected the growth for the owners employees.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>SWOT Analysis</b> – Since the total impact of the removal of MFA is still to be seen in the days to come, and the impact global competition is yet to be felt, there is need to analyze certain opportunities that may open up or threats that may need to be faced. The Knitwear sector also has certain strengths and weaknesses which will decide how it will fare in the face of these opportunities and threats. The SWOT was done on basis of research and as well as factors cited by experts and owners.</p>

</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>2.2 Citigroup, Bangladesh</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Citigroup started its operation in Bangladesh during 1987, by opening of a representative office. The main function of the bank at that time was limited to correspondent banking, L/C confirmation, credit appraisal of companies for Citigroup Hong Kong, Singapore, India etc. Based on the strengths with respect to global network, expertise in financial services and technology based delivery capabilities, Citigroup Bangladesh had been able to establish as one of the largest overseas correspondents for the nationalized banks in Bangladesh. Full-fledged operation of Citigroup started on June 24, 1995. Citigroup is a 100% owned branch office of Citibank, New York. Then on June 18, 2000 a new full service branch was opened in Chittagong, the commercial capital of Bangladesh. The branch is now operating business in a commercial hub of the city side-by-side most of its other counterparts. A third branch of Citigroup has started functioning Gulshan, Dhaka.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In this very short span of time, and with limited human resource of 93 permanent employees, Citigroup has been able to make a place for itself. In the year 2004, the bank’s net profit was Tk.38 crore. The operation of Citigroup in Bangladesh is still conservative and limited to serving financial needs of the leading business and corporate houses (through treasury operations, cash management, lending etc) although the bank has a plan to go for consumer banking in near future.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a name=""_Toc74293581""></a><strong>2.3 Bangladesh: As a Part of Citibank’s Global Market</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Citigroup worldwide is structured in two divisions: GRB (Global Relationship Banking), which includes all the markets in the developed world and deals with those MNCs that are Citibank’s clients all over the world; and EM (Emerging Markets), which basically includes the markets in the developing world. Emerging Market is again divided into three geographic segments: Latin America, Asia Pacific and CEEMA (Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bangladesh is one of 74 countries that fall under the head of Emerging Markets. Bangladesh belongs to the region, CEEMEA (Central Eastern Europe Middle East Africa), which includes 38 countries. In each of such regions, countries belong to different clusters; a cluster forms with 4/5 geographically close countries and the representative from the largest country in the cluster is chosen to be the Cluster Head. The cluster in which Bangladesh belongs to also includes India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. The regional head office of Citigroup Bangladesh is located at Mumbai, India.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a name=""_Toc74293582""></a><strong><a name=""_Toc12772802""></a>2.4 Structure of the Bank</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· <b>GRB (Global Relationship Banking)</b>, in which the RMs basically deal with the clients (multinational companies in Bangladesh) with whom Citigroup has global relationship. There is a single Parent Account Manager (PAM) in the country of origin of that MNC who is responsible for looking into the credit relationship between Citibank and the company worldwide. Any credit extended to the company has to be approved by the PAM.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· <b>TTLC (Top Tier Local Corporate)</b>, as the name suggests is the segment in which only the top performers (basically the first three ranked companies) of any industry are approached to be Citibank’s clients.

The next step is to collect customer information and make a detailed analysis of the needs of the client matched with what the bank can offer. After agreement of both parties, the bank gets approval from the lending unit. Once a company has become a client with credit relationship, the RMs then have to monitor the performance of the company and ensure that no classification of credit occurs.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Every year, Citigroup, Bangladesh has to submit to the cluster head the macro-economic indicators of the country and also the performance of the sub-sectors, and based on these, the portfolio is revised as to how much Citigroup can get involved in each sector.</p>

<h1 style=""text-align: justify;"">Import documents are delivered by courier and received at Mail Desk. The document is time stamped and reviewed by OIC Trade. A unique reference is assigned by the branch. The document is scanned in CI and taken up for scrutiny by E-Serve. A detailed checklist is provided to E-Serve for scrutiny. After completion of scrutiny, a presentation memo is generated through TE which includes the document arrival notice and list of discrepancies (if any). Overseas bank is also advised of acceptance or declining of document.</h1>
<h1 style=""text-align: justify;"">3.2.3 EDF (Export Development Fund)</h1>
<h1 style=""text-align: justify;"">Export Development Fund is a source of funding for financing foreign exchange import requirements of 100% export oriented industries for their imported inputs. The fund is owned by the Government of Bangladesh and managed by Bangladesh Bank. Bangladesh Bank uses EDF to refinance foreign exchange credits given by scheduled banks to eligible exporters. Under this arrangement, VMP customers may request for opening import Back to Back LCs on “Sight” basis.</h1>
<h1 style=""text-align: justify;"">A monthly reporting to BBK needs to be done on LCs issued under EDF. A letter for re-financing has to be sent upon execution of payment of import bill. Accordingly, BBK provides a loan to the Bank for the bill amount for a maximum tenor of 180 days. Upon realization of export proceeds, the BBK loan is liquidated for principal + interest. All IBBS entries for booking and liquidation of EDF loans are passed by E-Serve.</h1>
<h1 style=""text-align: justify;"">3.2.4 Shipping Guarantee</h1>
<h1 style=""text-align: justify;"">Customer letter and customer’s counter indemnity (duly signed by authorized signatories) is received at counter and time stamped, with signature verified. Customer provides acceptance of any and all discrepancies on original documents. Copy Invoice and Copy B/L is provided for Citibank’s perusal.</h1>
<h1 style=""text-align: justify;"">Branch processes the guarantee by completing checklist for guarantee issuance. Necessary entries are passed/authorized in IBBS by Branch.</h1>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>3.3 Export </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Export Bills submitted by customer at Citibank’s counters are either negotiated or sent on to overseas bank on collection basis. Upon realization of export proceeds, b/b LC payments, Packing Credits, EDF Loans are settled first and remaining balance credited to customer’s account as per their instructions.</p>
<h1 style=""text-align: justify;"">3.3.1 Export Bills under Collection</h1>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Export Document is received at counter, time stamped, and signature verified. A cover letter in the bank’s prescribed format is attached with the document. As per customer instruction, document is negotiated if document is clean or else negotiation is done with approval from BCC. Otherwise, document is sent under collection basis. For negotiation of discrepant documents, Trade Operations confirms continuation of the cross border exposure covering the import payment (if import liability is paid off from the proceeds of the negotiation) till receipt of the export proceeds at Citibank’s counter.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The full set of document is scanned in CI and taken up by E-Serve for processing after images authorized by branch. The document is scrutinized as per checklist available to E-Serve. Necessary entries are passed by E-Serve in IBBS if document is negotiated by the branch. The full set of document is dispatched through DHL by the branch.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The duplicate of the Export form is duly filled and submitted to BBK within 14 days of shipment.</p>
<h1 style=""text-align: justify;"">3.3.2 Export proceeds realization and utilization</h1>

Upon settlement of import bills, packing credit etc. the remaining balance is transferred to customer’s current and FCY RTN Quota account as per customer instruction.</h1>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Monthly BBK reporting of the triplicate copy of the EXP form is done upon realization of proceeds.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>3.3.3 Packaging Credit (Pre Shipment Finance) </b></p>
<h1 style=""text-align: justify;"">Packing Credit is the working capital finance towards the credit required for manufacture of export order in local currency other than the financing by the bank for import of raw and packing materials through issuance of back to back letter of credit. The credit is liquidated when the exporter ships and presents documents in order to avail post shipment credit or upon realization of export proceed against documents sent on collection.</h1>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>3.4 Risk identification</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There are several types of risks that are analyzed before going for extending Citibank’s services to the vendors. These are:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">n Credit Risks</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">n Commercial Risks</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">n Operational Risks</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">n Country Risks</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">n Documentation Risks</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">n Funding Risks</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">All obligors under this program will have been assigned Obligor Risk Rating (ORR), derived from DRM (Debt Rating Model). Citigroup rates the program based on the average probability of default of the obligors (multiplied by the limits of obligors), under the program.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The credit risk here is largely dependent on “performance risk” as the vendor may not have the ability to perform according to the requirements of the buyer. Whether the export order is placed via a PO or a LC, the ultimate risk is whether the buyer will approve the final product. Therefore, the buyer/vendor relationship is a critical element in analyzing performance risk.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Even though such risk will exist, the mitigating factor here is the PRAC done, i.e selection of vendor and approval of his buyer, checking the years of relationship of buyer with the exporter and positive reference on the buyer.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Commercial risks occur when Vendors, Buyers and Banks have disputes over conditions and rules governed by the operative L/C document under UCP 500 and local requirements .These risks can be controlled through the proper selection of Vendors and L/C issuing banks, for which Citigroup has a set rules.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>3.4.2 Operational Risk </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Buyers can refuse to pay identifying discrepancies that have been overlooked by Citibank. Operations will use a detailed checklist to facilitate the process and meet compliance requirements. Adequate resources in the Trade Processing Unit will ensure that Operations processing will continue to demonstrate high quality as a mitigant.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>3.4.3 Country Risk </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This program will operate within the country cross border limits. Export Bills with discrepancies, Import LCs and FX pre-settlement will be earmarked against country cross border limits.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Necessary documentation is to be taken per local standard bank forms. Individual RMs for respective VMP clients is responsible for obtaining all documentation prior to utilization. Country credit administration will check documentation prior to draw-down.<ins cite=""mailto:RAhmad"" datetime=""2004-05-19T15:32""></ins></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Citigroup Bangladesh, offers VMP products to its 100% Export oriented RMG (Ready Made Garments) clients. The products offered under this program can be divided into the following categories:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>3.4.5 Vendor Selection:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Vendor selection is accomplished by the credit filters and facility provided commensurate to level of experience with the Bank. This includes Pre-screening and trade feedback. Owners commitment to the business is also a key ingredient in analyzing vendor risk, which can be judged through site visits and talking to people from the same trade. This would also give an idea of the reputation of the vendor amongst the suppliers and the market.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>3.4.6 Banks Selection:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In general Buyers delinquency is covered by L/C issuing banks (Rated 5- or better), for the Pre-Export finance once performance per term of the L/C is completed. Banks with ORR of 5 or better would qualify automatically.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>3.4.7 Buyer Selection</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In case of a GRB buyer, Citigroup will insist satisfactory payment history. For others Citigroup is taking reference check. In any case, as per law of the land, taking buyer reference from an acceptable agency (Citigroup take from D&amp;B or from other Citigroup branches having relationship with the buyer) is mandatory.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>3.6 Key Success Factors for Vendors</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>For Vendors:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The garment export trade starts with the buyer placing an order with the seller (vendor). Therefore it must be noted that if the vendor is unable to secure orders from buyers, he is out of business. In order for the vendor to be successful in securing orders continuously he must consistently make delivery in the right quality, at the right time and at the right price. To maintain these attributes and standards (Price, Quality and Delivery) the vendors will be required to consistently upgrade their production facilities, increase productivity and have a strong management team.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Therefore in identifying a quality vendor one must look for the following:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">1. <b>Experienced</b>: who has been in business for a considerably long time (&gt;+5yrs for group),</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">2. <b>Reputed</b>: who has long-term buyer relationship, and has secured business consistently from reputed buyers,</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">3. <b>Successful</b>: buyers are willing to place continuous orders,</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">4. <b>Good Management with Farsightedness</b>: experienced and committed management focused towards consistent upgrading and improving production facilities,</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">5. <b>Financial Strength of the Group</b>: who may sustain in the cut-throat price war situation,</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">6. <b>Buyer Diversification</b>: who has diversified based on buyer as well as destination,</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">7. <b>Adherence to International Labor Standards</b>: with buyers becoming more and more demanding about the quality of life being given to garments workers, manufacturers have to ensure that they adhere to stringent labor laws, factory construction standards etc. Most of the large buyers have their own inspection team and standards certification process before they procure from sellers.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Overview of RMG Industry</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bangladesh is the twelfth largest garments manufacturing nation in the world. The garments sector is divided into the textile and the readymade garments (RMG) segments. The textile segment is sub-divided into a number of activities, which include: spinning, weaving, and fabric processing; and the RMG segment includes knitwear and woven items.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Since the late 1970s, the RMG industry started developing in Bangladesh primarily as an export-oriented industry. RMG now accounts for 77% of the total merchandise exports of Bangladesh and 94% of the RMG export is dependent on the quota-restrained markets.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>The Role of Human Resource Department in Corporate Social Responsibility</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Objectives of the Study</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Broad Objectives: </b>The broad objective of the report was to look on Human Resource Management (HRM) through the framework of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). How CSR trend and expectations forced specific HRM changes, developments, and HRM influences through internal corporate stakeholders, employees the corporate social responsibility, sustainability performance of a company. Discussing different important parts and views of CSR we often mention the important formula CSR?HR=PR while indicating a key role for human resource management, and indirectly to employees themselves.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Specific Objectives: </b>In order to fulfill this broad objective, the following specific objectives have to be pursued:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Internal CSR activities have helped HRM activities like motivation, retention, loyalty and recruitment Gather information on the internal CSR activities of Square Pharmaceuticals Ltd.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Considering the HRM practices from their CSR perspective How SPL intend to integrate CSR and HRM; and to which level they are successful.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· The company successfully used HRM to promote CSR</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· The role/influence of HRM on the CSR policy of the company is significant</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Relationship between Employee Motivation and Internal CSR activities</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Significance of the study</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Human resource managers are well positioned to play an instrumental role in helping their organization achieve its goals of becoming a socially and environmentally responsible firm – one which reduces its negative and enhances its positive impacts on society and the environment. Further, human resource (HR) professionals in organizations that perceive successful corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a key driver of their financial performance can be influential in realizing on that objective. While there is considerable guidance to firms who wish to be the best place to work and for firms who seek to manage their employee relationships in a socially responsible way, there is a dearth of information for the HR manager who sees the importance of embedding their firm’s CSR values throughout the organization, who wish to assist the executive team in integrating CSR into the company’s DNA. And as high profile corporate failures such as Enron make all too clear, organizations that pay lip-service to CSR while neglecting to foster a CSR culture run the risk of damaging their corporate reputation if not their demise. Indeed, HR’s mandate to communicate and implement ideas, policies, and cultural and behavioral change in organizations makes it central to fulfilling an organization’s objectives to “integrate CSR in all that we do.” That said, it is important to understand that employee engagement is not simply the mandate of HR. Indeed people leadership rests with all departmental managers. HR can facilitate the development of processes and systems; however, employee engagement is ultimately a shared responsibility. The more the HR practitioner can understand their leverage with respect to CSR, the greater their ability to pass these insights along to their business partners towards the organization’s objectives in integrating CSR throughout their operations and business model.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As human resources influence many of the key systems and business processes underpinning effective delivery, it is well positioned to foster a CSR ethic and achieve a high performance CSR culture. Human resource management can play a significant role so that CSR can become “the way we do things around here”. HR can be the key organizational partner to ensure that what the organization is saying publicly aligns with how people are treated within the organization. HR is in the enviable position of being able to provide the tools and framework for the executive team and CEO to embed CSR ethic and culture into the brand and the strategic framework of the organization. It is the only function that influences across the entire enterprise for the entire ‘lifecycle’ of the employees who work there – thus it has considerable influence if handled correctly. HR is poised for this lead role as it is adept at working horizontally and vertically across and within the organization, so important for successful CSR delivery.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Methodology</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To accomplish the research both qualitative and quantitative methods has been followed. Initially,</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· <b>Secondary Research:</b> Secondary Research has been performed by undertaking various literature reviews and internet- based research to gather information about the background and history of Square Pharmaceuticals operations. Furthermore, secondary research in terms of various journal and literature review and related web research has also been undertaken to gather relevant information regarding the issue of CSR and HRM about Square Pharmaceuticals Ltd.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· <b>Primary Research:</b> While collecting the primary data, I have followed the following methods:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">o <b>Questionnaire method:</b> This report is extensively based on extensive primary research in terms of conducting surveys on different activities of HR and the effects on internal CSR activities. The survey has helped me to understand about various HR activities like motivation, retention, recruitment and loyalty in contrast with internal CSR activities of Square Pharmaceuticals. And also helped to understand the employee’s position about the integration of CSR and HRM.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">o <b>Interview method:</b> While collecting information, I have taken the interview of some officials of SPL and individual employees of Square Pharma.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Limitations of the study</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The internship report is not free from limitations. The study has been conducted on the subject of “The Role of Human Resource Management in Corporate Social Responsibility: A Square Pharma perspective” Key limitations of the study are as follows:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Sufficient books, publications, facts and figures are not available; these constraints narrowed the scope of accurate analysis.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· It was very difficult to collect data from such a big organization. My internship was at Square Pharmaceuticals Ltd. But because of some divisional and confidential problem, I could not get enough information.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Another limitation of the report is the organizations’ policy not to disclose some data and information to keep secrecy the administration policy.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Theoretical Analysis on HRM of Investment Corporation of Bangladesh in comparison to the HRM of other Financial Institutions</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.1: Introduction</b>:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With the increase in the size and complexity of business organizations, man has become the most important factor in business. Business needs people as owners, employees, and consumers. Organizations need people to make them operate. Business may be operated differently and the objectives of business may differ, but the universal element in all business activities is people. An organization is nothing without human resources. Any human organization- a factory, a hospital, or an association- consists of people working together. According to economists, the factors of production are land, labor, capital and entrepreneurship. Of all the resources, the most important one is human resource, because human begins play a dual role- as resource, as well as a motive force for all other resources by manipulating them, by way of developing, utilizing, commanding and controlling.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.2: Definition of HRM:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The purpose of HRM is to improve the product line contribution of people to the organization in ways that are strategically, ethically &amp; socially responsible. Human resources determine every organizations success.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There are many definitions about human resources management (HRM). One of the well known definitions is offered by Micheal Jucious (1984). He defined human resources management or personnel management “as the field of procuring, developing, maintaining and motivating a labor force”.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Human resources management concerns the personnel policies &amp; management practices &amp; system that influence the work force regardless of the size or existence of a formal HRM or personnel department – H.John Bernardin.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.3: The Objective of Human Resource Management</b>:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Managers and HR departments achieve their purpose by meeting objectives. Objectives are benchmarks against which actions are evaluated. Four HR objectives are given below:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.3. A: Organizational objective</b>:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To recognize that HR management exists to contribute to organizational effectiveness. Even when a formal HR department is created to help managers, the managers remain responsible for employee performance. The HR department exists to help managers achieve the objectives of the organization. HR management is not an end in itself, it is only a means of assisting managers with their human resource issues.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.3. B: Fictional objective</b>:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Maintain the department’s contribution at a level appropriate to the organizations needs. Resources are wasted when HR management is more or less sophisticated than the organization demands.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.3. C: Societal objective</b>:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ethically and socially responsive needs and challenges of society while minimizing the negative impact of such demands on the organization. The failure of organizations to use their resources for society’s benefits in ethical ways may result in restrictions.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.3. D: Personal objective</b>:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Assist employees in achieving their personal goals, at least insofar as those goals enhance the individual’s contribution to the organization. The personal objectives of employees must be met if workers are to be maintained, retained, and motivated.</p>

</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.4: Importance of HRM</b>:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">HRM involves all management decisions and practices that directly influence the people and human resources, who work for the organization. Obviously HRM is concern with the people’s dimension in organization. The core points are:</p>
<ol start=""1"" style=""text-align: justify;"" type=""1"">
<li><b>Hire the right person for the jobs</b>:</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Human resources management hires the right person for the specific job. Specialized people can done their specific work very properly then any other unspecialized people.</p>

<li><b>Lower turnover</b>:</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It reduces turnover, HRM look after the benefits, incentives, compensation, which results reduce the turnover.</p>
<ol start=""3"" style=""text-align: justify;"" type=""1"">
<li><b>Make the people of the organization do their best</b>:</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When an employee is more skilled &amp; knowledgeable his devotion will be higher &amp; his performance can give the benefits to the organization much effectively.</p>
<ol start=""4"" style=""text-align: justify;"" type=""1"">
<li><b>Save time</b>:</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If wrong people are selected for organization than organization have to higher new one that is more time wasted process. But HRM practice can save this time by hiring the right person for the right job.</p>
<ol start=""5"" style=""text-align: justify;"" type=""1"">
<li><b>Avoid discriminatory actions</b>:</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">HRM obey the discriminatory rule regarding on the employee rights.</p>
<ol start=""6"" style=""text-align: justify;"" type=""1"">
<li><b>Fair remuneration/ Compensation</b>:</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">HRM determine the salary, wages &amp; compensation fairly according on the basis of position, nature of the duty, responsibility, work time etc.</p>

<li><b>Identify training needs</b>: HRM decide the appropriate training for employee that is done by on the orientation or other ways can be on the job training &amp; of the job training.</li>
<li><b>Lower unfair labor</b>:</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">HRM fairly design compensation, so the person who is competent &amp; who has requirement get the proper compensation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.5: HRM activities:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Simply put, HRM is a management function that helps managers’ recruit, select, train and develops members for an organization obviously. HRM is concerned with people’s dimension in organization.</p>
<ol start=""1"" style=""text-align: justify;"" type=""1"">
<li><b>Human resources planning</b>:</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">HRP systematically forecasts an organization future demand for &amp; supply of employee. HR planning is also called to develop staffing plans that support the organizations strategy by allowing it to fill job openings proactively.</p>
<ol start=""2"" style=""text-align: justify;"" type=""1"">
<li><b>Recruitment &amp; selection</b>:</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Recruitment is the process of finding &amp; attracting capable applicants for employment. The process begins when new recruits are sought &amp; ends when their applications are submitted. The result is a pool of applicants from which new employees are selected.</p>
<ol start=""3"" style=""text-align: justify;"" type=""1"">
<li><b>Placement</b>:</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Placement decision is taken offer the selection process. This is the process of put the right person for the right place according to their skills &amp; qualification.</p>
<ol start=""4"" style=""text-align: justify;"" type=""1"">
<li><b>Orientation &amp; training</b>:</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Employee should be oriented about the organization. How the work is performed that process is called training. It’s the teaching about gaining the practical knowledge.</p>

</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Performance evaluation is a way to measure how well employees perform his work. That is important for increase the effectiveness of the employee’s performance.</p>
<ol start=""6"" style=""text-align: justify;"" type=""1"">
<li><b>Compensation &amp; protection</b>:</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Employee should be compensated by the wages, salary &amp; fairly. If the compensation is too low then employee face dissatisfaction &amp; if the compensation is too high than it could be against of company low. Deciding appropriate compensation can motivate the employee’s performance.</p>
<ol start=""7"" style=""text-align: justify;"" type=""1"">
<li><b>Employee relation &amp; assessment</b>:</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It maintains the relationship between whole unions of organization &amp; assesses the work activities.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.6: Personnel management VS Human resources management</b>:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Although on some key issues- a natural concern for people, and their need, together with finding efficient means to select, train, appraise, develop and reward them, there are some point of dissimilarities between personnel management (PM) and human resource management (HRM). Traditional personnel management tends to be parochial, striving to attend line managers, with a strong proactive stance and a bias towards business. PM has a history of placing emphasis on bureaucratic control often in a reactive sense, i.e., control of manpower and personnel systems. Some would argue that PM represented a highly compartmentalized system.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">By contrast, HRM makes a determined effort to be a more integrative mechanism in bringing people issue into line with business issues, with a pronounced problem – seeking and problem solving orientation, and a determination to build collaborative organizational systems. The role of top management in setting the agenda for change and development is very much in evidence in HRM.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Some personnel managers will no doubt see the growing influence of HR managers as a threat fearing that they may just become custodians of personnel systems. Beer (1997) identified major obstacles in transforming the traditional administrative personnel function and moving to a fully fledged HRM system. He function is that most HR professionals do not possess the requisite analytical and interpersonal skills.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In HRM there is a greater emphasis on strategic issues and on the way which the human resource contributes to the achievement of corporate objectives. HRM underlines the importance of flexibility and the ability to react and adapt quickly to changes in the organizational environment.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">PM can be described as a series of activities related to various aspects of an employee’s relationship with the organization. HRM is also concerned with these issues, but in addition stresses the primacy of business needs. Other points of departure are that HRM embraces individual flexibility and congruency between individual and organizational goals, whereas PM is concerned with systems applied to individuals and collectivism.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.7: Meaning and recruitment</b>:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Recruitment is the process of finding and attracting qualified or suitable applications to fill vacancies. This is the process of locating potential candidate for selection. It is the discovering of potential candidate for selection. It is the discovering of potential candidates for actual or actual or anticipated organizational vacancies. During this process, efforts are made to inform the applicants fully about the selection criteria, i.e. the required competences, which will lead to effective performance and the career opportunities the organization can provide for them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dale Yoder (1986) defines recruitment as a process of searching for prospective employees and stimulating and encouraging them to apply for jobs in an organization. The process begins when new recruits are sought and ends when their applications are submitted. The result is pool of qualified applicants from which new employees are selected. Recruiting is important because the best- qualified applicants must be found to fill vacancies.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.8: Objectives of recruitment policy</b>:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Objectives are targets and goals. According to Yoder, following are the main objectives of recruitment policy:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">– To find and employee the best qualified person for each job.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">-To retain the best and most promising ones.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">-To offer promising careers and security</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">-To provide facilities for growth and development</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">-To minimize the cost of recruitment</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">-To reduce scope of favoritism and malpractice.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.10: Factors Affecting Recruitment</b>:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There are many factors affecting recruitment. These factors may be considered in to two broad groups:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Internal factors: These are the factors within organization. These factors are listed down here:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">– Image of the organization. An origination with poor image cannot attract a large number of applicants. For example, among most university graduates Dhaka University has a positive image.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">– Image of job or attractiveness of the job. If the job to be filled is unattractive, recruiting a large and qualified pool of applicants will be difficult.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">-Internal policies. Internal organizational policies such as promote from within will give priority to individuals inside the organization. Such a policy will usually ensure that all positions will be filled form within the ranges.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">-Trade union requirements.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">-Recruiting budgets</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">External factors: these are the factors over which organization has little or no control. Some of these are given below:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">-Demographic factors: gender ratio, age group, and educational level.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">-Government requirements.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">-Industrialization: industrialization within the geographical area and geographical concentration will have influence on employment market in recruitment.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">-labor market: supply of labor may be plenty or shortage. In Bangladesh, supply of labor of unskilled labor is abundant but there is shortage of skilled labor. The right type is difficult to find.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.11: Sources of Recruitment</b>:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There are basically two sources of supply from where potential employees can be drawn. These are internal sources and external sources.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.11. A: Internal sources</b>: internal source indicate recruiting qualified people from within the organization itself (from the present working force). When reference is made to the number of employees already employed by the organization we speak of the internal supply. Whenever any vacancy occurs, someone form within the organization is upgraded, prompted or transferred to another department.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.11. B: External sources</b>: recruitment form outside the organization is known as external source. All firms more or less rely on external sources.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.12: Meaning of Selection</b>:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Once a pool of suitable applicants is created through recruiting, the process of selecting applicants begins. Selecting means choosing form those applicants who are most likely to succeed in the new job. It is the technique of choosing a new member of the organization from the available candidates. The selection process is a series of steps used to decide which recruits should be hired.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dale Yoder (1972) defines selection as a process by which candidates are divided into class-those who will be offered employment and those who will not. The process begins when recruits apply for employment and ends with the hiring decision.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.13: Training and Development:</b></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Weather &amp; Climate :</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bangladesh has a tropical monsoon-type climate, with a hot and rainy summer and a dry winter. January is the coolest month with temperatures averaging near 26 deg C (78 d F) and April the warmest with temperatures from 33 to 36 deg C (91 to 96 deg F). The climate is one of the wettest in the world. Most places receive more than 1,525 mm of rain a year, and areas near the hills receive 5,080 mm ). Most rains occur during the monsoon (June-September) and little in winter (November-February).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bangladesh is subject to devastating cyclones, originating over the Bay of Bengal, in the periods of April to May and September to November. Often accompanied by surging waves, these storms can cause great damage and loss of life. The cyclone of November 1970, in which about 500,000 lives were lost in Bangladesh, was one of the worst natural disasters of the country in the 20th century.</p>
<p>Bangladesh has warm temperatures throughout the year, with relatively little variation from month to month. January tends to be the coolest month and May the warmest. In Dhaka the average January temperature is about 19°C (about 66°F), and the average May temperature is about 29°C (about 84°F).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Required clothing: Lightweight cottons and linens throughout the year. Warmer clothes are needed in the evenings during the cool season. Waterproofs are necessary during the monsoon season.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Season :</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Traditionally Bangladeshis subdivide the year into sixseasons:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Grismo (summer)March to May</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Barsha (rainy)June to August</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Sharat (autumn)September to October</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hemanto (cool)October to November</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Sheet (winter)November to December</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bashonto (spring)December to February</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For practical purposes, however, three seasons are distinguishable:</p>
<p>summer, rainy, and winter.</p>

The exact origin of the word “Bangla” or “Bengal” is unknown, though it is believed to be derived from <i>Bang</i>, the Dravidian-speaking tribe that settled in the area around the year 1000 BC.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After the arrival of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Aryans"" title=""Indo-Aryans"">Indo-Aryans</a>, the kingdom of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangaridai"" title=""Gangaridai"">Gangaridai</a> was formed from at least the seventh century BC, which later united with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar"" title=""Bihar"">Bihar</a> under the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magadha"" title=""Magadha"">Magadha</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurya_Empire"" title=""Maurya Empire"">Maurya Empires</a>.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Islam was introduced to Bengal in the twelfth century by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufism"" title=""Sufism"">Sufi</a> missionaries, and subsequent Muslim conquests helped spread <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"" title=""Islam"">Islam</a> throughout the region. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakhtiyar_Khalji"" title=""Bakhtiyar Khalji"">Bakhtiar Khilji</a>, a Turkish general, defeated <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshman_Sen"" title=""Lakshman Sen"">Lakshman Sen</a> of the Sena dynasty and conquered large parts of Bengal. The region was ruled by dynasties of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan"" title=""Sultan"">Sultans</a> and feudal lords for the next few hundred years. By the 16th century, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire"" title=""Mughal Empire"">Mughal Empire</a> controlled Bengal, and Dhaka became an important provincial centre of Mughal administration.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">European traders arrived late in the 15th century, and their influence grew until the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_East_India_Company"" title=""British East India Company"">British East India Company</a> gained control of Bengal following the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Plassey"" title=""Battle of Plassey"">Battle of Plassey</a> in 1757. The bloody rebellion of 1857, known as the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rebellion_of_1857"" title=""Indian rebellion of 1857"">Sepoy Mutiny</a>, resulted in transfer of authority to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom"" title=""Monarchy of the United Kingdom"">crown</a>, with a British <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viceroy"" title=""Viceroy"">viceroy</a> running the administration. During colonial rule, famine racked the Indian subcontinent many times, including the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1943"" title=""Bengal famine of 1943"">Great Bengal famine</a> of 1943 that claimed 3 million lives. Between 1905 and 1911, an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_Bengal_%281905%29"" title=""Partition of Bengal (1905)"">abortive attempt</a> was made to divide the province of Bengal into two zones, with Dhaka being the capital of the eastern zone. When India was partitioned in 1947, Bengal was <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_Bengal_%281947%29"" title=""Partition of Bengal (1947)"">partitioned</a> along religious lines, with the western part going to India and the eastern part joining <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan"" title=""Pakistan"">Pakistan</a> as a province called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Bengal"" title=""East Bengal"">East Bengal</a> (later renamed East Pakistan), with its capital at Dhaka.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In 1950, land reform was accomplished in East Bengal with the abolishment of the feudal <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamindar"" title=""Zamindar"">zamindari</a> system. However, despite the economic and demographic weight of the east, Pakistan’s government and military were largely dominated by the upper classes from the west. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_Language_Movement"" title=""Bengali Language Movement"">Bengali Language Movement</a> of 1952 was the first sign of friction between the two wings of Pakistan. Dissatisfaction with the central government over economic and cultural issues continued to rise through the next decade, during which the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Awami_League"" title=""Bangladesh Awami League"">Awami League</a> emerged as the political voice of the Bengali-speaking population. It agitated for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_point_movement"" title=""Six point movement"">autonomy</a> in the 1960s, and in 1966, its president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was jailed; he was released in 1969 after an unprecedented popular uprising.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Mujibur_Rahman"" title=""Sheikh Mujibur Rahman"">Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</a>, founder of Bangladesh. In 1970, a massive <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_Bhola_cyclone"" title=""1970 Bhola cyclone"">cyclone</a> devastated the coast of East Pakistan, and the central government responded poorly. The Bengali population’s anger was compounded when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, whose <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League"" title=""Awami League"">Awami League</a> won a majority in Parliament in the 1970 elections, was blocked from taking office. After staging compromise talks with Mujib, President <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Khan"" title=""Yahya Khan"">Yahya Khan</a> arrested him on the early hours of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_26"" title=""March 26"">March 26</a>, 1971, and launched <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Searchlight"" title=""Operation Searchlight"">Operation Searchlight</a>, a sustained military assault on East Pakistan. Yahya’s methods were extremely bloody, and the violence of the war resulted in many civilian deaths. Chief targets included <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual"" title=""Intellectual"">intellectuals</a> and Hindus, and about ten million <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"" title=""Refugee"">refugees</a> fled to neighbouring India (LaPorte, p. 103). Estimates of those massacred throughout the war range from three hundred thousand to 3 million.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Most of the Awami League leaders fled and set up a government-in-exile in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata"" title=""Kolkata"">Calcutta</a>, India. The Bangladesh Liberation War lasted for nine months. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare"" title=""Guerrilla warfare"">guerrilla</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukti_Bahini"" title=""Mukti Bahini"">Mukti Bahini</a> and Bengali regulars eventually received support from the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Armed_Forces"" title=""Indian Armed Forces"">Indian Armed Forces</a> in December 1971. The Indian army, under the command of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagjit_Singh_Aurora"" title=""Jagjit Singh Aurora"">Lt. General J.S.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">During the twentieth century, its resilient inhabitants seem to have suffered one trauma after another. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Mujibur_Rahman"" title=""Sheikh Mujibur Rahman"">Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</a> (Mujib) led the nation to independence in 1971, but he and his successor <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziaur_Rahman"" title=""Ziaur Rahman"">Ziaur Rahman</a> (Zia) were both assassinated only in a span of six years. Their legacies (and families) define Bangladesh’s democracy to this day.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Natural History :</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Satellite image presenting physical features of Bangladesh.</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bangladesh is located in the low-lying <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges"" title=""Ganges"">Ganges</a>–<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmaputra"" title=""Brahmaputra"">Brahmaputra</a> River Delta or Ganges Delta. This delta is formed by the confluence of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges_River"" title=""Ganges River"">Ganges</a> (local name <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padma_River"" title=""Padma River"">Padma</a> or <i>Pôdda</i>), <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmaputra_River"" title=""Brahmaputra River"">Brahmaputra</a> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamuna_River"" title=""Jamuna River"">Jamuna</a> or <i>Jomuna</i>), and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghna_River"" title=""Meghna River"">Meghna</a> rivers and their respective tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna to eventually empty into the Bay of Bengal. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alluvium"" title=""Alluvium"">alluvial soil</a> deposited by these rivers has created some of the most fertile plains in the world. Bangladesh has 58 <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-boundary_river"" title=""Trans-boundary river"">trans-boundary rivers</a>, making water issues politically complicated to resolve – in most cases as the lower <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riparian"" title=""Riparian"">riparian</a> state to India. Most parts of Bangladesh are less than 12 metres (39 ft) above the sea level, and it is believed that about 50% of the land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by a metre (3 ft).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The highest point in Bangladesh is in Mowdok range at 1,052 metres (3,451 ft) in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittagong_Hill_Tracts"" title=""Chittagong Hill Tracts"">Chittagong Hill Tracts</a> to the southeast of the country. A major part of the coastline comprises a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh"" title=""Marsh"">marshy</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle"" title=""Jungle"">jungle</a>, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundarbans"" title=""Sundarbans"">Sundarbans</a>, the largest <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove"" title=""Mangrove"">mangrove</a> forest in the world and home to diverse flora and fauna, including the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Bengal_Tiger"" title=""Royal Bengal Tiger"">Royal Bengal Tiger</a>. In 1997, this region was declared endangered.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Straddling the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Cancer"" title=""Tropic of Cancer"">Tropic of Cancer</a>, Bangladeshi climate is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics"" title=""Tropics"">tropical</a> with a mild winter from October to March, a hot, humid summer from March to June. A warm and humid monsoon season lasts from June to October and supplies most of the country’s rainfall. Natural calamities, such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floods_in_Bangladesh"" title=""Floods in Bangladesh"">floods</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone"" title=""Tropical cyclone"">tropical cyclones</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado"" title=""Tornado"">tornadoes</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_bore"" title=""Tidal bore"">tidal bores</a> occur almost every year, combined with the effects of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation"" title=""Deforestation"">deforestation</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soils_retrogression_and_degradation"" title=""Soils retrogression and degradation"">soil degradation</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"" title=""Erosion"">erosion</a>. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox%27s_Bazar"" title=""Cox's Bazar"">Cox’s Bazar</a>, south of the city of Chittagong, has a beach that stretches uninterrupted over 120 kilometres (75 mi).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In September 1998 Bangladesh saw the most severe flooding the modern world has seen. As the Brahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna spilt over and swallowed 300,000 houses, 6,000 miles (9,700 km) of road and 1,600 miles (2,600 km) of embankment 1,000 people were killed and 30 million more were made homeless with 135,000 cattle killed, 50 square kilometres of land destroyed and 11,000 kilometres of roads damaged or destroyed. Two-thirds of the country was underwater. There were several reasons for the severity of the flooding. Firstly, there were unusually high <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon"" title=""Monsoon"">monsoon</a> rains. Secondly, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas"" title=""Himalayas"">Himalayas</a> shed off an equally unusually high amount of melt water that year. Trees that usually intercept rain water were cut down for firewood or to make space for animals.</p>

Bangladesh remains a poor, overpopulated, and inefficiently-governed nation. Although more than half of GDP is generated through the service sector, nearly two-thirds of Bangladeshis are employed in the agriculture sector, with rice as the single-most-important product. Garment exports and remittances from Bangladeshis working overseas, mainly in the Middle East and East Asia, fuel economic growth.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Tourism in Bangladesh</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>General Overview of Bangladesh</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>1.0 BANGLADESH: Country Profile</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bangladesh as a holiday making land exposes to many flamboyant facets. Its tourist attractions are many folded, which include archaeological sites, historical mosques and monuments, resorts, beaches, picnic spots, forests and tribal people, wildlife of various species. Bangladesh offers ample opportunities to tourists for angling, water skiing, river cruising, hiking, rowing, yachting, sea bathing as well as bringing one in close touch with pristine nature.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>2.1.1. Location &amp; Physical F<a name=""location""></a>eatures</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Located in the north-eastern part of South Asia, Bangladesh lies between 20º34′ and 26º36′ north latitude and 88º01′ and 92 º 41’ east longitudes. The majestic Himalayas stand some distance to the north, while in the south lays the Bay of Bengal. The gangetic Plains of west Bengal border the country on the west and in the east lie the hilly and forested regions of Tripura, Mizoram(India) and Myanmar. These picturesque geographical boundaries frame a low lying plain of about 1, 47,570 sq.km criss-crossed by innumerable rivers and streams. Mighty rivers the Padma(Ganges), the Brahamaputra (Jamuna) &amp; the Meghna and the Karnafuli. This is Bangladesh, a fertile land where nature is bounteous.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Much of the country’s land area has been built up from alluvial deposits brought down by the major rivers. The country is mostly flat except for a range of hills in the south-east. The topography of the country is characterized by wooded marshy lands and jungles with plane lands occupying most of the river basins. There are deep forested regions in Sylhet, Rangamati, Khagrachhari and Bandarban Hill Districts, Sundarbans (the World Heritage site), Mymensingh and Tangail.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>2.1.2. History Of E<a name=""history""></a>mergence</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bangladesh has a long and eventful history as a nation. Although it enjoyed as a free and sovereign state only in 1971, after a nine month-long war of liberation, the land itself and its people, have their origin in antiquity. The earliest nation of Bangladesh in found in the 9th century BC Indian epic the Mahabharata.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There are evidences of story Mongoloid presence at the time. Then in 5th &amp; 6th century BC came the Aryans from Central Asia and Dravidians from western India. The Hindu and Buddhist dynasties of guptas, palas and senas ruled the country until 13th century, when Muslim conquerors took over the reigns of the country.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Muslim rules either belonging to independent dynasties such as the Hossain Shahi or Ilyas Shahi dynasties or Viceroys exercising power on behalf of the imperial seat of Delhi and continued to rule the country until the middle of the 18th century, when the British took over the control of Bengal and eventually the whole of India. The Europeans, mainly Portuguese, Dutch, French and British traders had began to arrive in Bangladesh from the 15th century and extended an economic control over the region.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>2.1.3. Modern Period</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In 1757 British coloniers defeated the last Muslim ruler of Bengal, Nowab Sirajuddoullah at Palassey. After the end of the British rule in 1947, the country was partitioned into India and Pakistan. But the movement for autonomy for East Pakistan began within a couple of years because of linguistic and cultural differences and economic disparity between the two wings. The seeds of independence were sown through the great Language Movement of 1952 to recognize Bangla as a State Language. Then East Pakistan emerged as a sovereign and independent state of Bangladesh. After nine month-long sanguinary war of liberation in 1971. In which three million people courted martyrdom. We got the liberation at 16 December of 1971. And so for this, we call the 16 December as our Victory day of Bangladesh.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>2.1.4. Demography</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bangladesh has a population of 133.40 million making it the most densely populated country of the world. 85% population lives in rural areas. Density of population is about 900 per sq.km. There are about 2 million people of 23 tribes. They dwell mostly in Rangamati, Khagrachhari, and Bandarban and in part of northern districts. The tribes have exotic distinct cultures of their own. Their food habit also different from other people.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.1.5. <i>Language</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The state language and mother toung is Bangla. English is widely spoken and understood. Now days some young people are learning other languages like French, German, Spanish, <b>Japanese, and Chinese etc. for professional purpose. </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>2.1.6. Religion</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bangladesh is a land of religious freedom, harmony and tolerance. People of all castes and creeds live here in perfect harmony. The percentage distribution of population to religions is as follows: Muslims – 88%, Hindus – 10%, Christians, Buddhists and others 2%.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>2.1.7. Government</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The country is officially known as The People’s Republic of Bangladesh and has a parliamentary form of Government. The President is the Head of the State while the Prime Minister is the Head of the Government. The country is divided into 6(six) divisions namely Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi, Barisal, Sylhet and Khulna. There are 64 districts, 465 upazillas (small administrative unit) and 85,650 villages under the six divisions.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>2.1.8. Legislature</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bangladesh has a 345-seat Parliament called ‘Jatiyo Sangsad’. 300 members of Jatiyo Sangsad are directly elected by the Electoral College and 45 seats are reserved for women, nominated proportionately by the members of different parties in parliament. They are designated as Member of the Parliament.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>2.1.9. Economy</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Economy is characterized by a large subsistence agricultural sector, which contributes to sum 85% of the country’s population and small modern industrial sector. The total cultivable area is around 24 millions acres and there are a little more than 15 million cultivators. Major agricultural crops are rice, jute (the golden fiber), wheat, potato, pulses, sugarcane, tea, onion, garlic, ginger, tobacco etc. Tea, leather, ready made garments, frozen shrimp, jute and jute products are major foreign exchange earners. Export of handicrafts is booming fast. Remittances from Bangladeshis employed abroad are also contributing significantly towards foreign exchange earnings.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.2. Historical development</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The development of international recommendations concerning the concepts and definitions related to tourism has a long history. In 1937 the Council of the League of Nations recommended a definition of “international tourist” for statistical purposes. This definition was slightly amended by the International Union of Official Travel Organizations (IUOTO) at a meeting held in Dublin in 1950. Finally, in 1953, the United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC) defined the concept of “international visitor”.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">During the post-Second World War era, tourism demand has rapidly increased and tourism has become a worldwide phenomenon. Not surprisingly, this post-war boom has drawn the attention of many developing countries, and tourisms one of the growing industries of the world economy has enticed many entrepreneurs and governments of various countries to invest in the tourism industry</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bangladesh government also recognized and made policy for the developed of tourism industry in 1972 and 1992 respectively.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.3. Definition of Tourism</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The World Tourism Organization defines tourism as ‘the activities of persons traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes’. This broad definition of tourism is then broken down into six categories1 according to the purpose of the trip:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ø Leisure, recreation and holidays</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ø Visiting friends and relatives</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ø Business and professional</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ø Health treatment</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ø Religion/pilgrimages</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The term tourism could be viewed from different angles like economic, managerial, marketing, social, and environmental and so on. However the international association of scientific experts in tourism (AIEST) adopted the following definition of tourism:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Tourism is the some of the phenomena and relationships arising from the travel and stay of non-residents in so far as they do not lead to permanent residence and are not connected with any earning activity.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In this definition, a broad concept has been developed which included various forms of business and vocational travel and identified a “travelers is a pure consumer”.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>2. 3.1. Classification of Tourist</i>:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.4. Tourism in Bangladesh</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bangladesh is one of the few countries in South Asia, which remains to be explored. Bangladesh has a delicate and distinctive attraction of its own to offer and it is definitely not a tourist haunt like Nepal or India. Bangladesh is like a painter’s dream come true with a rich tapestry of colors and texture. The traditional emphasis of the tourist trade has always been on the material facilities offered by a country rather than on its actual charms. This may be a reason why Bangladesh has seldom been highlighted in the World’s tourist maps.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
It’s a land of enormous beauty, hundreds of serpentine rivers, crystal clear water lakes surrounded by ever green hills, luxuriant tropical rain forests, beautiful cascades of green tea gardens, world’s largest mangrove forest preserved as World Heritage, home of the Royal Bengal Tiger and the wild lives, warbling of birds in green trees, wind in the paddy fields, abundance of sunshine, world’s longest natural sea beach, rich cultural heritage, relics of ancient Buddhist civilizations and colorful tribal lives, – Bangladesh creates an unforgettable impression of a land of peace.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.5. Tourism Policy</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Promotion of tourism in Bangladesh under the aegis of the government started in 1972. Recognizing the contribution of tourism to the socio-economic development of the country, the government framed the National Tourism Policy in 1992. In the Tourism Policy, status of tourism industry in Bangladesh was described, aims and objectives were defined and implementation strategies were suggested.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The National Industrial Policy 2005 has recognized tourism as an industry and declared it as a “thrust sector”. As per the Industrial Policy, foreign investors have been offered various incentives to invest in tourism industry, which include:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(a) Tax exemption on royalties;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(b) Tax exemption on the interest of foreign loans;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(c) Tax exemption on capital gains from the transfer of shares;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(d) Avoidance of double taxation in case of foreign investors on the basis of bilateral agreements;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(e) Exemption of income tax on salaries up to three years for the foreign technicians</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(f) Remittance up to 50% of the salary of the foreigners employed in Bangladesh</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(g) Facilities for repatriation of invested capital, profits and dividends;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(h) Guarantee against expropriation and nationalization of foreign private investment (as per Foreign Private Investment Promotion &amp; Protection Act 1980);</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.6. Tourists Baggage Rules</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Tourist Baggage (Import) Rules -1981 shall apply to visitors staying in the country for more than 24 hours but not for more than 06(six) months on condition that the visitors shall not intend to reside in the country nor shall get remunerated from within it and in that event she/he shall be allowed to import the following items without duty or tax:</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.9. The National Tourist Organization in Bangladesh</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation as National Tourist Organization (NTO)</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The principal channel of Government involvement in the tourism sector is the national tourism organization, Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation, which is a semi autonomous government agency reporting to the Ministry of civil Aviation and Tourism as its administrative Ministry. Importantly, the national airline Biman Bangladesh Airlines, forms a separate division within the same Ministry, which allows integration and of tourism initiatives. Many of BPC’s managerial matters are handling through the national Tourism Facilitation committee headed by the secretary of the ministry of Aviation and Tourism. BPC was created on the 27th November 1972 by order of the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and commenced business in January 1973. It was established as a Corporation under the laws of the country with an authorized capital of Tk one crore (roughly US$ 1.3 million then) and initial share capital of Tk five lakhs (roughly US$ 65,000 then). It has created 42 tourism units (hotels. motels, restaurants, tourism centre, picnic spots, duty free shops, drinks corner, etc.) at different places of tourist attractions of the country in order to offer facilities to the tourists. It also runs a National Hotel and Tourism Training Institute (NHTTI), which to date, produced more than 24,000 trained manpower.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>2.9.1. Objectives of National Tourist Organization in Bangladesh</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The objectives are as follows:</p>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li>To introduce Bangladesh globally as a top tourist destination and develop its tourism prospects and facilities.</li>
<li>To establish tourism infrastructures in Bangladesh.</li>
<li>To develop, expand and promote tourism business.</li>
<li>To create tourism awareness among the people.</li>
<li>To publish tourism publications.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>2.9.2. Functions of National Tourist Organization in Bangladesh</i></b></p>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li>To promote and develop tourism</li>
<li>To provide facilities to undertake measures and carry out all kinds of activities connected with tourism</li>
<li>To acquire, establish, construct, arrange, provide and run hotels, restaurants, rest houses, picnic spots, camping sites, theatres, amusement parks and facilities for water skiing and entertainment.</li>
<li>To establish institutes for instruction and training of potential tourism personnel.</li>
<li>To bring out tourism publication.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.10. Government Investment in Tourism</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Despite the low priority given by the Government to tourism at a national level there have been some important investments in both Parjatan and Biman.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>2.10.1. Government investment in BPC</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The audited, consolidated balance sheet of the Corporation as at 30 June 1984 (the latest available at the time of preparation of the master plan report) shows total government investment of over Tk 20 crore. That amount, equivalent to us$ 6.7 million was composed of fully paid capital of Tk 345 lakhs (us$ 1.15 million), grants Tk 281 lakhs (us$ 0.93 million), and loans Tk 14.4 crore (us$ 4.82 million). Of the total investment at the balance sheet date, net assets account for Tk 13.9 crore (us$ 4.62 million) and operating losses (including depreciation) for Tk 9.2 crore (us$ 3.07 million). The operating losses occurred in the years from 1972 to 1983 and have been partially offset by profits since then.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>2.10.2. Government investment in Biman Bangladesh airlines</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The government as sole stockholder in Biman was not primarily making an investment in tourism but in an airline with potential to become an important contributor tourist flows. Substantial levels of investment have taken place both in Biman and in the rehabilitation and development of domestic airports. In TFYP, for example an allocation is made to Biman of Tk 140 crore (us$ 47 million), and to domestic airport development to Tk 70 crore (us$ 23 million), for improvements at Sylhet and Chittagong and for further capital works at Zia international Airport in Dhaka. Such investments are supportive to tourism development aspirations particularly those investments in the national carrier although clearly the investments have wider implications than for tourism alone.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>2.10.3. Private Investment in Tourism</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">A range of concessionary investment incentives are offered to the private sector in tourism activities, in line with other special capital depreciation regulations, etc. In addition, the tourism sector receives significant loan finance from the commercial banks. The starting date for the period of income tax exemption for companies in the tourism sector has been extended to June 1990. The period of exemption varies with the district in which the activity is arrived on and portions of the profits must be reinvested in the activity or in government bonds. Recent private sector investment initiatives appear limited to Dhaka, however. The primary reasons for this would appear to be demand deficiency rather than any institutional constraints. One of the examples of private investment in tourism is Fantasy Kingdom.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.11. Manpower Development and Training</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It has been recognized by BPC that the Corporation is short of professional staff in its hotel operations division particularly and that the development of tourism in Bangladesh will require training of management cadres. In order to establish and develop a professional training programme within the tourism industry in Bangladesh, BPC established the Hotel and Tourism Training Institute (HTTI), which was jointly funded in 1978 by the Government of Bangladesh and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) with the International Labor Organization (ILO) as executing agency.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The first phase of the project finished in 1983 and the second phase commenced in February 1986. The Institute and the hotel are housed in purpose-built facilities having, in addition to 20 bedrooms and usual hotel facilities, classroom areas, a training restaurant, training and demonstration kitchens, a front office reception area, a conference room, offices and administrative areas. The ILO, besides helping the Government to develop the hospitality industry, is also helping to develop human resources by providing in-depth training programmes. The full-time courses, supervised by international experts and consultants, cover the following specializations:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">??Hotel and Restaurant Kitchen Training</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">??Restaurant Service</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">??Front Office and Secretarial</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">??Creation of job titles for sector personnel to replace the currently used civil service names</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">??Budgetary and financial management including hotel accounting</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">??Tour operator and ground handling courses.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">??Improvement of staff attitudes and capability</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There will also be part-time of day-release courses in various aspects of the industry, according to identified needs, such as:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">??Hygiene and Sanitation for Food Handlers</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">??Short on-the-job Instructor Training Courses</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">??Communications and Social Skills</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">??Short courses in different aspects of catering for nonprofessionals.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">??One-year scholarships, to be given for overseas training at university graduate level.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">??The development of a series of three six-week regional training courses.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.14. Marketing Strategy of BPC</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If we want to attract more tourists then new directions, new strategy and an integrated tourism marketing effort are needed. The products offered by Bangladesh tourism industry must be unique and competitive in the target market.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Marketing strategy consists of decisions on marketing expenditure, marketing mix and allocation of fund to different elements of marketing mix. Marketing mix comprises of four elements:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">1. Product Strategy</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">2. Place Strategy</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">3. Price Strategy</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">4. Promotion Strategy</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>2.14.1 Product Strategy</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The product strategy in tourism marketing involves in deciding what tourism product, services and facilities to offer to target market. Product strategy also involves in deciding of the type of packaging (tours) to be offered. To attract the Japanese and Korean visitors we have no alternative but to develop our Paharpur, Mainamoti and Mahasthan Garh.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>2.14.2. Pricing Strategy</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Pricing is an important factor from marketing viewpoint as consumers in general are price sensitive. The market for international tourism industry is so competitive that nothing bad and unattractive product can be sold. As a strategy for enhancing the receipts from international tourism, we may offer some very high standard package tour for the top market at a reasonable price.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>2.14.3. Promotion Strategy</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Millions of prospective tourists must be made aware about our product. The BPC prints a large number of brochures, folders, posters etc and sends these to different tour operators, overseas Biman offices, Embassies and High Commission offices for exhibition and distribution. However, we feel that the present promotional strategy of BPC is neither appropriate nor satisfactory. We did not get any folder or booklet on the attraction of Bangladesh.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The BPC should open its own office in some big potential markets like- Tokyo, Seol, Bangkok, New Delhi, London, New York, Berlin etc. And also should publish its booklets, journals, posters etc in different languages.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>2.14.4. Distribution Strategy</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">As tourism marketing is service marketing so the distribution system of tourism products differs from that of a tangible product. Again tourism marketing although a service marketing differs from the marketing of typical service goods. In the tourism marketing the distribution channels are usually airlines, travel agents, tour operators, travel wholesaler, travel clubs etc.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In the following table we represent a proposed service product mix for successful marketing of Bangladesh tourism products.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Miles of golden sands, towering cliffs, surfing waves, rare conch shells, colorful Pagodas, Buddhist Temples and delightful sea-food – all this makes what Cox’s Bazar is today , the tourist capital of Bangladesh. The World’s longest uninterrupted (120 km.) beach slopes here down to the blue waters of the Bay of Bengal against the picturesque background of a chain of hills covered with deep green forests. Cox’s Bazar is one of the most attractive tourist spots in the world. The warm, shark free, waters are good for bathing and swimming &amp; while the sandy beaches offer opportunities for sun-bathing.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
The beauty of the setting-sun behind the waves of the sea is simply captivating. Locally made cigars and handloom products of the tribal Rakhyne families are good buys.</p>
<p>Located at a distance of 152 km. south of Chittagong, Cox’s Bazar is connected both by air and road from Dhaka and Chittagong.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>St. Martin Island</b><a name=""stmartin""></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Forty-eight kilometers from Teknaf, St. Martin’s is the country’s only coral island and an unspoilt paradise. Named Narikel Jinjira (Coconut Island) by the locals, the dumbbell shaped St.Martin’s has an area of only 8 sq. km. which reduces to about 5 sq. km. and in places from 1-4 meters during high tide. The Cox’s Bazar Holiday Complex of Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation on the island is a shore tourist resort having comfortable accommodation, catering, sightseeing and other facilities.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Patenga Beach</b><a name=""patenga""></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Patenga beach at Chittagong is one of the most popular beaches of Bangladesh, stretching for miles near at the meeting place of the Bay of Bengal and the river Karnaphuli. Nature lovers come around here to enjoy the scenic sunrise and sunset.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Parki Beach<a name=""parki""></a></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Parki beach is situated in Gahira, Anwara Thana under southern Chittagong region. The beach lies about 28 km. away from Chittagong city. As the beach is situated at the Karnaphuli river channel, visitors can view both the Karnaphuli River and the sea together. Tourists enjoy the views of big ships anchored at the outer anchor, fishermen catching fish in sea, sunset, various colored crabs at the beach, and quiet environment. In the picnic season, many visitors come to the beach for celebrating the picnic.</p>

Fairs are also held where one can buy handloom and other handicraft items. A visit to a Rakhyne family and the hundred year old Buddist temple should be on each visitor’s itinerary.Kuakata has road communication with Dhaka, but the journey may be long and a bit stressful. A much easier way is to go to Barisal by air and from there travel by road or water to Patuakhali or Kuakata. BRTC runs a direct bus service from Dhaka to Kuakata via Barisal. Besides, Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation may organize guided package tours from Dhaka to Kuakata on demand.</p>

By the 16th century, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire"" title=""Mughal Empire"">Mughal Empire</a> controlled Bengal, and Dhaka became an important provincial centre of Mughal administration.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">European traders arrived late in the 15th century, and their influence grew until the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_East_India_Company"" title=""British East India Company"">British East India Company</a> gained control of Bengal following the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Plassey"" title=""Battle of Plassey"">Battle of Plassey</a> in 1757. The bloody rebellion of 1857, known as the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rebellion_of_1857"" title=""Indian rebellion of 1857"">Sepoy Mutiny</a>, resulted in transfer of authority to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom"" title=""Monarchy of the United Kingdom"">crown</a>, with a British <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viceroy"" title=""Viceroy"">viceroy</a> running the administration. During colonial rule, famine racked the Indian subcontinent many times, including the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1943"" title=""Bengal famine of 1943"">Great Bengal famine</a> of 1943 that claimed 3 million lives. Between 1905 and 1911, an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_Bengal_%281905%29"" title=""Partition of Bengal (1905)"">abortive attempt</a> was made to divide the province of Bengal into two zones, with Dhaka being the capital of the eastern zone. When India was partitioned in 1947, Bengal was <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_Bengal_%281947%29"" title=""Partition of Bengal (1947)"">partitioned</a> along religious lines, with the western part going to India and the eastern part joining <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan"" title=""Pakistan"">Pakistan</a> as a province called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Bengal"" title=""East Bengal"">East Bengal</a> (later renamed East Pakistan), with its capital at Dhaka.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In 1950, land reform was accomplished in East Bengal with the abolishment of the feudal <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamindar"" title=""Zamindar"">zamindari</a> system. However, despite the economic and demographic weight of the east, Pakistan’s government and military were largely dominated by the upper classes from the west. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_Language_Movement"" title=""Bengali Language Movement"">Bengali Language Movement</a> of 1952 was the first sign of friction between the two wings of Pakistan. Dissatisfaction with the central government over economic and cultural issues continued to rise through the next decade, during which the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Awami_League"" title=""Bangladesh Awami League"">Awami League</a> emerged as the political voice of the Bengali-speaking population. It agitated for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_point_movement"" title=""Six point movement"">autonomy</a> in the 1960s, and in 1966, its president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was jailed; he was released in 1969 after an unprecedented popular uprising.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Mujibur_Rahman"" title=""Sheikh Mujibur Rahman"">Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</a>, founder of Bangladesh. In 1970, a massive <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_Bhola_cyclone"" title=""1970 Bhola cyclone"">cyclone</a> devastated the coast of East Pakistan, and the central government responded poorly. The Bengali population’s anger was compounded when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, whose <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League"" title=""Awami League"">Awami League</a> won a majority in Parliament in the 1970 elections, was blocked from taking office. After staging compromise talks with Mujib, President <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Khan"" title=""Yahya Khan"">Yahya Khan</a> arrested him on the early hours of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_26"" title=""March 26"">March 26</a>, 1971, and launched <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Searchlight"" title=""Operation Searchlight"">Operation Searchlight</a>, a sustained military assault on East Pakistan. Yahya’s methods were extremely bloody, and the violence of the war resulted in many civilian deaths. Chief targets included <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual"" title=""Intellectual"">intellectuals</a> and Hindus, and about ten million <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"" title=""Refugee"">refugees</a> fled to neighbouring India (LaPorte, p. 103). Estimates of those massacred throughout the war range from three hundred thousand to 3 million.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Most of the Awami League leaders fled and set up a government-in-exile in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata"" title=""Kolkata"">Calcutta</a>, India. The Bangladesh Liberation War lasted for nine months. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare"" title=""Guerrilla warfare"">guerrilla</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukti_Bahini"" title=""Mukti Bahini"">Mukti Bahini</a> and Bengali regulars eventually received support from the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Armed_Forces"" title=""Indian Armed Forces"">Indian Armed Forces</a> in December 1971. The Indian army, under the command of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagjit_Singh_Aurora"" title=""Jagjit Singh Aurora"">Lt. General J.S.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">During the twentieth century, its resilient inhabitants seem to have suffered one trauma after another. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Mujibur_Rahman"" title=""Sheikh Mujibur Rahman"">Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</a> (Mujib) led the nation to independence in 1971, but he and his successor <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziaur_Rahman"" title=""Ziaur Rahman"">Ziaur Rahman</a> (Zia) were both assassinated only in a span of six years. Their legacies (and families) define Bangladesh’s democracy to this day.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Natural History :</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Satellite image presenting physical features of Bangladesh.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bangladesh is located in the low-lying <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges"" title=""Ganges"">Ganges</a>–<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmaputra"" title=""Brahmaputra"">Brahmaputra</a> River Delta or Ganges Delta. This delta is formed by the confluence of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges_River"" title=""Ganges River"">Ganges</a> (local name <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padma_River"" title=""Padma River"">Padma</a> or <i>Pôdda</i>), <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmaputra_River"" title=""Brahmaputra River"">Brahmaputra</a> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamuna_River"" title=""Jamuna River"">Jamuna</a> or <i>Jomuna</i>), and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghna_River"" title=""Meghna River"">Meghna</a> rivers and their respective tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna to eventually empty into the Bay of Bengal. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alluvium"" title=""Alluvium"">alluvial soil</a> deposited by these rivers has created some of the most fertile plains in the world. Bangladesh has 58 <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-boundary_river"" title=""Trans-boundary river"">trans-boundary rivers</a>, making water issues politically complicated to resolve – in most cases as the lower <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riparian"" title=""Riparian"">riparian</a> state to India. Most parts of Bangladesh are less than 12 metres (39 ft) above the sea level, and it is believed that about 50% of the land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by a metre (3 ft).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The highest point in Bangladesh is in Mowdok range at 1,052 metres (3,451 ft) in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittagong_Hill_Tracts"" title=""Chittagong Hill Tracts"">Chittagong Hill Tracts</a> to the southeast of the country. A major part of the coastline comprises a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh"" title=""Marsh"">marshy</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle"" title=""Jungle"">jungle</a>, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundarbans"" title=""Sundarbans"">Sundarbans</a>, the largest <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove"" title=""Mangrove"">mangrove</a> forest in the world and home to diverse flora and fauna, including the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Bengal_Tiger"" title=""Royal Bengal Tiger"">Royal Bengal Tiger</a>. In 1997, this region was declared endangered.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Straddling the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Cancer"" title=""Tropic of Cancer"">Tropic of Cancer</a>, Bangladeshi climate is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics"" title=""Tropics"">tropical</a> with a mild winter from October to March, a hot, humid summer from March to June. A warm and humid monsoon season lasts from June to October and supplies most of the country’s rainfall. Natural calamities, such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floods_in_Bangladesh"" title=""Floods in Bangladesh"">floods</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone"" title=""Tropical cyclone"">tropical cyclones</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado"" title=""Tornado"">tornadoes</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_bore"" title=""Tidal bore"">tidal bores</a> occur almost every year, combined with the effects of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation"" title=""Deforestation"">deforestation</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soils_retrogression_and_degradation"" title=""Soils retrogression and degradation"">soil degradation</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"" title=""Erosion"">erosion</a>. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox%27s_Bazar"" title=""Cox's Bazar"">Cox’s Bazar</a>, south of the city of Chittagong, has a beach that stretches uninterrupted over 120 kilometres (75 mi).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In September 1998 Bangladesh saw the most severe flooding the modern world has seen. As the Brahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna spilt over and swallowed 300,000 houses, 6,000 miles (9,700 km) of road and 1,600 miles (2,600 km) of embankment 1,000 people were killed and 30 million more were made homeless with 135,000 cattle killed, 50 square kilometres of land destroyed and 11,000 kilometres of roads damaged or destroyed. Two-thirds of the country was underwater. There were several reasons for the severity of the flooding. Firstly, there were unusually high <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon"" title=""Monsoon"">monsoon</a> rains. Secondly, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas"" title=""Himalayas"">Himalayas</a> shed off an equally unusually high amount of melt water that year. Trees that usually intercept rain water were cut down for firewood or to make space for animals.</p>

Bangladesh remains a poor, overpopulated, and inefficiently-governed nation. Although more than half of GDP is generated through the service sector, nearly two-thirds of Bangladeshis are employed in the agriculture sector, with rice as the single-most-important product. Garment exports and remittances from Bangladeshis working overseas, mainly in the Middle East and East Asia, fuel economic growth.</p>

<b>Tourism Industry In Bangladesh</b></p>
<h4 style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Introduction</b></h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Tourism is one of the most dynamic industries of the present world. People want to travel. This is the basic trait in human nature. Millions of people are traveling each year from one part to another part of this planet. People are now prone to fun and enjoy. They intend to gather experiences of new things and new places, get lasting pleasure, and know different cultures through visiting destinations. They also want to escape from the pressures of work-deadlines. People, being curious, move from one place to another, from one country to another country, from one end of the world to another, and may be in future, from one planet to other ones. Thus tourism is one of the initiators of people’s movement, a facilitator for exchange of knowledge, a provider of pleasure, a way to enjoy leisure, and a means to enrich culture.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bangladesh is a poor country having lots of potentiality in various sectors. Tourism is one of his potential sectors but it is still unexplored by the decision maker or relevant agency. Her tourist attractions include archeological sites, historic mosques and monuments, resorts, beaches, picnic spots, forest and wildlife. Bangladesh is an irrigated country having attractive panoramic beauty. There are hills, vales, deep and mangrove forests, rivers and the longest beach in the world. In this country, the scope of nature based tourism, research based tourism, culture based tourism, and eco-tourism is quite evident.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Objectives </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The purposes of preparing this project paper are:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">1. To analyze the significance of tourism</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">2. To study the existing tourism facilities and opportunities.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">3. To create a significant judgment about its various resources.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">4. To evaluate the potentials of tourism</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">5. To identify the problems to the development of tourism.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">7. To provide necessary suggestions and policy implications for the development of tourism.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Methodology of the Study</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Necessary information and data has been collected from the officials of those organizations through the direct interview method by using structured questionnaire. In addition, review all the tourism related websites for updated information. In total 25 officials have been interviewed during the study period for official information and 50 domestic tourists have been interviewed for unearthing the most demandable facilities regarding tourism industry.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Limitations of the study</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The study covered very limited number of sample organizations in respect of its real scope all over the country. There is no plethora of research work in Bangladesh context in this field. Sometimes respondent were not interested to express to their honest opinion. To overcome these limitations, an exhaustive study of existing literature in this field, foreign journal, relevant publication by Government and other private agencies were studied. This is fully self-financed research work that is it could not be able to cover wider area.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>An Overview of Tourism Industries in Bangladesh</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Tourism is the business of the transport, care, feeding and entertainment of the tourists. Indian Merchants Chamber states, ‘Tourism is a force that enriches, restores and transforms, and does that both for a land and its people’. Therefore, tourism may be defined as an industry which aims at enhancing social and geographical mobility of the man by performing a variety of necessary functions for fulfilling various human motives with a view to earning profit.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bangladesh had always been a good destination for the international tourists. But with passage of time Bangladesh has lost its attraction as a major tourist destination and at present it could not be placed in the list of major tourist importing countries of the world.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Brief History</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bangladesh as a vacation land has many facets. Her tourist attractions include archaeological sites, historic mosques and monuments, resorts, beaches, picnic spots, forest and wildlife. Bangladesh offers opportunities for angling, water-skiing, river cruising, hiking, rowing, surfing, yachting and sea bathing as well as bringing one in close touch with Mother Nature. She is also rich in wildlife and game birds.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>LOCATION AND PHYSICAL FEATURES</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bangladesh is situated in the north-eastern part of south Asia. It lies between 20′ 34′ and 2e 36′ north latitude and 88′ I’ and 92′ 41′ east longitude. The hoary and great Himalayas stand as the northern ramparts, while the southern frontier is guarded by the Bay of Bengal. On the west lies the expansive gangetic plains (West Bengal) of India and on the eastern frontier lay the almost impassable forest of Myanmar (Arakan Province) and India (Tripura and Assam hills). These picturesque geographical boundaries delineate</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">out a low lying plain at about 144,000 sq. km. (55,598 sq. miles) cries -crossed by innumerable brooks, rivers, rivulets and streams. Mighty rivers the Padma, Jamuna, Meghna, Karnaphuli and others flow through Bangladesh. The unsalable blue is stretched high above, and the green and silvery landscape below runs far and beyond. This is Bangladesh, a fertile land where nature is bounteous.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bangladesh is a deltaic region. Much of the country’s land area has been built up from alluvial deposits brought down by the major rivers. The land is mostly flat except for a range of hillsin the south-east. Wooded marshy lands and jungles mainly characterize it with forest regions in Sylhet, Rangamati, Khagrachari and Bandarban Hill Tracts, Sundarbans, Mymensingh and Tangail.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>History</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The history of Bangladesh has been one of extremes, of turmoil and peace, prosperity and destitution. It has thrived under the glow of cultural splendor and suffered under the ravages of war. The earliest mention of Bangladesh is found in the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata (the story of Great Battle-9th century B.C). Evidence also suggests that there was a strong Mongoloid presence as well. Soon after, in the 5th and 6th centuries B.C. came the Aryans from Central Asia and the Dravidians from Western India. Then the Guptas, Palas, and Senas, came who were Buddhist and Hindus.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">From the 13th century A.D. the flood of Muslim invaders and the tide of Islam swamped the Buddhist and Hindus untold 8th century. Sometimes there were independent rulers like the Hussain Shahi and Ilyas Shahi dynasties while at other times they ruled on behalf of the imperial seat of Delhi. From 15th century the Europeans, namely; Portuguese, Dutch, French and British traders exerted an economic influence over the region. British political rule over the region began in 1757 A.D. when the last Muslim ruler of Bengal was defeated at Palassey. In 1947 the country was partitioned into India and Pakistan. Present Bangladesh becomes the Eastern Wing of the then Pakistan. But the movement for autonomy for East</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Pakistan started within a couple of years because of language and cultural difference and economic disparity between the two wings. The seeds of independence were sown through the Language Movement of 1952 to recognize Bangla as a state language. Ultimately the then East Pakistan emerged as a sovereign and independent state of Bangladesh in 1971 after nine month – long war of Liberation (starting on 26 March 1971) in which 3 million people courted martyrdom.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Transportation</b></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Kuakata, locally known as Sagar Kannya (Daughter of the Sea) is a rare scenic beauty spot on the southernmost tip of Bangladesh. Kuakata in Latachapli union under Kalapara Police Station of Patuakhali district is about 30 km in length and 6 km in breadth. It is 70 km from Patuakhali district headquarters and 320 km from Dhaka. At Kuakata excellent combination of the picturesque natural beauty, sandy beach, blue sky, huge expanse of water of the Bay and evergreen forest in really eye-catching.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The name Kuakata have originated from Kua-Well dug on the sea shore by the early Rakhine settlers in quest of collecting drinking water, who landed on Kuakata coast after explled from Arakan by Moughals. Afterwards, it has become a tradition of digging Kua-Well in the neighbourhood of Rakhaine homestead for collection water for drinking purpose and general use.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>TOURIST ATTRACTIONS:</i> </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Kuakata is one of the rarest places which has the unique beauty of offering the full view of the rising and setting of crimson sun in the water of the Bay of Bengal in a calm environment. That perhaps makes kuakata one of the world’s unique beaches. The long and wide beach at Kuakata has a typical natural setting. This sandy beach has gentle slopes into the Bay of Bengal and bathing there is as pleasant as is walking or diving. Kuakata is truly a virgin beach-a sanctuary for migratory winter birds, a series of coconut trees, sandy beach of blue Bay, a feast for the eye. Forest, boats plying in the Bay of Bengal with colourful sails, fishing, towering cliffs, surfing waves everything here touches every visitor’s heart.

Innumerable devotees arrive here at the festival of ‘Rush Purnima’ and ‘Maghi Purnima’. On these two days they take holy bath and traditional fairs are held here. All these additional offers to panoramic beauty make the beach more attractive to the visitors. One should visit Kuakata and discover the lovely grace of Bangladesh.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>MEANS OF COMMUNICATION:</i> </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There exists road communication between Dhaka and Patuakhali district headquarters which are ccessible by road, water or airtransport upto Barisal. Then one may travel by road or water to Kuakata or Patuakhali.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">BRTC has introduced direct bus service from Dhaka to Kuakata via Barisal.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Other facilities:</i> </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A pond of crystal clean sweet water beside the motel attracts the tourists. For advance reservation and further details one may contact: Central Reservation, Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation. Head Office, 233, Airport Road, Tejgaon, Dhaka. Phone: 880-2- 8119192, 880-2-8117855-9, Fax: 880-2-8117235. E-mail: <a href=""mailto:bpcho@bangla.net"">bpcho@bangla.net</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Beach sites: </i></b>Kuakata sea beach is a nature of beauty. It is about 18 km long &amp; 3.5 km wide. The tourist, who came here, can see the Sunrise &amp; Sunset from the same place. It’s a great opportunity &amp; in the world this type of opportunity is only in Japan. The sea beach is surrounded by green trees &amp; beside the beach, there are many wooden trees garden &amp; forest, like The Foyej Miyar Coconut Garden, Lembur Chor, Jhauban, Gangamotir Chor etc. These gardens &amp; forests are the most attracting part for the tourist. There are no quicksands in the beach. So the tourists can frequently run, take bath, swim, &amp; pick up cockle from the beach. But there is no signal light to alert, no enough sitting place on the beach, no life jacket, no coast guard &amp; life saving men to ensure security for the tourist.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There are two rivers; named Payra &amp; Bishkhali are west of the beach &amp; a river named Agunmukha is East of the beach. They all are concentrated in the Bay of Bengal. This entire river made a channel about half kilometer outside from the beach. This half-kilometer is about 3-4 feet deep &amp; the channel is about 14-15 feet deep. This channel is about half kilometer &amp; after the channel the height of the water is again 3-4 feet, it is about 2-3 kilometer. Now days, the beach is consequently breaking down by the flow of water through the channel. So, if the government could not take necessary steps to save this beach recently then our country may lose a valuable tourist spot.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Rakhain Polly: </i></b>It is not sure at which time people started to live in Kuakata. But everybody believes that Rakhain community was the oldest inhabitants here. Once upon a time Rakhains were the majority here but now they became the minority. But they have maintained their history, culture, with in this Rakhain Polly. If you go there you can watch their life style &amp; daily work very closely.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Generally Rakhain’s life style &amp; cultural activities are different than ours. They are “Buddhist” in religion &amp; “Buddha Purnima” is their main religion festival around the year. Their every home has an own embodiment. Most of women are engaged in making handicraft. They made Lunge, Scarf, and Shawl etc. They have an own market in Kuakata, named “Rakhain Mohila Market”. They bring materials from Burma &amp; Cox-bazar. Men are engaged in agriculture. Most of them are not educated. Often people of other culture interrupt their life style &amp; religion. So most of them are contracted in mind because they think they are small in number in our country.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Sima Buddha Temple: </i></b>It is situated near the sea beach. The temple is made of wood &amp; tin. It cannot be accurately said at which time it was built. But it can be surely said that it is very o;ld. In the temple there is statue of Buddha made by eight metal situated on a three foot high stand. It is second embodiment in south Asia.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Coconut Grove &amp; Jhaubon: </i></b>The coconut grove was built on 200 acre areas around sea beach in 1960’s decade. But for the continuous &amp; unprotect able breaking of beach a part of the grove has already lost. At the east side of the grove there is a beautiful Jhaubon (on 15 hector) made by the forest department. At the sunlight of evening &amp; at the moonlight the coconut grove &amp; jhaubon look very beautiful. At the daytime, the continuous whizzing sound of Jhaubon hears very nice to visitors.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Fatrar Chor: </i></b>At the west side of the beach there is a small Island named Fatrar Chor (99705.07), a mangrove forest. People started to call it the “Second Sundorbon”. Keuya, Gauya, Goran golpata etc type of mangrove trees are seen there. There are also many birds &amp; animals like monkeys, pigs etc.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Gongamotir Chor: </i></b>Another attractive place for the tourists is Gongamotir Chor, which is 10 km east of Kuakata’s main land. Though it is less known to visitors for poor communication, the most attractive place here is the “Gongamotir Lake”. There are many trees like Keuya, Gauya, Saila etc many animals like wild pig, monkeys etc.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Lembur Chor: </i></b>Five kilometer east of Kuakata beach there is an attractive place named Lembur Chor. There is a forest of Keuya, Korai, Gauya, Saila etc of 1000 acor.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Rasmela: </i></b>The word “Rus” mainly came from the word “Ros”. This festival was started depending on collecting “ros” in winter; later the festival name became “Rasmela”. It is one of the main religious programs of “Monipuri”. At the time of “Rasmela” festival many visitors came here to enjoy it.</p>

Fishermen catch many kinds of sea fish from sea during the year but mainly the fishes which are caught in winter season, are be sunned in process. This “Shutki Fish” is supplied in many places of our country, mainly in Dhaka. The people who like to eat “Shutki” but have not seen the process of drying fish; this can be a place for them to get experience.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>8. Khulna</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Gateway to the Sundarban abode of the Royal Bengal Tigers Khulnais an industrial town and Divisional Headquarter. The Mongla Seaport is close by.

<b>Tourism Industry In Bangladesh</b></p>
<h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>
<p>Tourism is one of the most dynamic industries of the present world. People want to travel. This is the basic trait in human nature. Millions of people are traveling each year from one part to another part of this planet. People are now prone to fun and enjoy. They intend to gather experiences of new things and new places, get lasting pleasure, and know different cultures through visiting destinations. They also want to escape from the pressures of work-deadlines. People, being curious, move from one place to another, from one country to another country, from one end of the world to another, and may be in future, from one planet to other ones. Thus tourism is one of the initiators of people’s movement, a facilitator for exchange of knowledge, a provider of pleasure, a way to enjoy leisure, and a means to enrich culture.</p>
<p>Bangladesh is a poor country having lots of potentiality in various sectors. Tourism is one of his potential sectors but it is still unexplored by the decision maker or relevant agency. Her tourist attractions include archeological sites, historic mosques and monuments, resorts, beaches, picnic spots, forest and wildlife. Bangladesh is an irrigated country having attractive panoramic beauty. There are hills, vales, deep and mangrove forests, rivers and the longest beach in the world. In this country, the scope of nature based tourism, research based tourism, culture based tourism, and eco-tourism is quite evident.</p>
<p><b>Objectives</b></p>
<p>The purposes of preparing this project paper are:</p>
<p>1. To analyze the significance of tourism</p>
<p>2. To study the existing tourism facilities and opportunities.</p>
<p>3. To create a significant judgment about its various resources.</p>
<p>4. To evaluate the potentials of tourism</p>
<p>5. To identify the problems to the development of tourism.</p>
<p>7. To provide necessary suggestions and policy implications for the development of tourism.</p>
<p><b>Methodology of the Study</b></p>
<p>Necessary information and data has been collected from the officials of those organizations through the direct interview method by using structured questionnaire. In addition, review all the tourism related websites for updated information. In total 25 officials have been interviewed during the study period for official information and 50 domestic tourists have been interviewed for unearthing the most demandable facilities regarding tourism industry.</p>
<p><b>Limitations of the study</b></p>
<p>The study covered very limited number of sample organizations in respect of its real scope all over the country. There is no plethora of research work in Bangladesh context in this field. Sometimes respondent were not interested to express to their honest opinion. To overcome these limitations, an exhaustive study of existing literature in this field, foreign journal, relevant publication by Government and other private agencies were studied. This is fully self-financed research work that is it could not be able to cover wider area.</p>
<p><b>An Overview of Tourism Industries in Bangladesh</b></p>
<p>Tourism is the business of the transport, care, feeding and entertainment of the tourists. Indian Merchants Chamber states, ‘Tourism is a force that enriches, restores and transforms, and does that both for a land and its people’. Therefore, tourism may be defined as an industry which aims at enhancing social and geographical mobility of the man by performing a variety of necessary functions for fulfilling various human motives with a view to earning profit.</p>
<p>Bangladesh had always been a good destination for the international tourists. But with passage of time Bangladesh has lost its attraction as a major tourist destination and at present it could not be placed in the list of major tourist importing countries of the world.</p>
<p><b>Brief History</b></p>
<p>Bangladesh as a vacation land has many facets. Her tourist attractions include archaeological sites, historic mosques and monuments, resorts, beaches, picnic spots, forest and wildlife. Bangladesh offers opportunities for angling, water-skiing, river cruising, hiking, rowing, surfing, yachting and sea bathing as well as bringing one in close touch with Mother Nature. She is also rich in wildlife and game birds.</p>
<p><b>LOCATION AND PHYSICAL FEATURES</b></p>
<p>Bangladesh is situated in the north-eastern part of south Asia. It lies between 20′ 34′ and 2e 36′ north latitude and 88′ I’ and 92′ 41′ east longitude. The hoary and great Himalayas stand as the northern ramparts, while the southern frontier is guarded by the Bay of Bengal. On the west lies the expansive gangetic plains (West Bengal) of India and on the eastern frontier lay the almost impassable forest of Myanmar (Arakan Province) and India (Tripura and Assam hills). These picturesque geographical boundaries delineate</p>
<p>out a low lying plain at about 144,000 sq. km. (55,598 sq. miles) cries -crossed by innumerable brooks, rivers, rivulets and streams. Mighty rivers the Padma, Jamuna, Meghna, Karnaphuli and others flow through Bangladesh. The unsalable blue is stretched high above, and the green and silvery landscape below runs far and beyond. This is Bangladesh, a fertile land where nature is bounteous.</p>
<p>Bangladesh is a deltaic region. Much of the country’s land area has been built up from alluvial deposits brought down by the major rivers. The land is mostly flat except for a range of hillsin the south-east. Wooded marshy lands and jungles mainly characterize it with forest regions in Sylhet, Rangamati, Khagrachari and Bandarban Hill Tracts, Sundarbans, Mymensingh and Tangail.</p>
<p><b>History</b></p>
<p>The history of Bangladesh has been one of extremes, of turmoil and peace, prosperity and destitution. It has thrived under the glow of cultural splendor and suffered under the ravages of war. The earliest mention of Bangladesh is found in the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata (the story of Great Battle-9th century B.C). Evidence also suggests that there was a strong Mongoloid presence as well. Soon after, in the 5th and 6th centuries B.C. came the Aryans from Central Asia and the Dravidians from Western India. Then the Guptas, Palas, and Senas, came who were Buddhist and Hindus.</p>
<p>From the 13th century A.D. the flood of Muslim invaders and the tide of Islam swamped the Buddhist and Hindus untold 8th century. Sometimes there were independent rulers like the Hussain Shahi and Ilyas Shahi dynasties while at other times they ruled on behalf of the imperial seat of Delhi. From 15th century the Europeans, namely; Portuguese, Dutch, French and British traders exerted an economic influence over the region. British political rule over the region began in 1757 A.D. when the last Muslim ruler of Bengal was defeated at Palassey. In 1947 the country was partitioned into India and Pakistan. Present Bangladesh becomes the Eastern Wing of the then Pakistan. But the movement for autonomy for East</p>
<p>Pakistan started within a couple of years because of language and cultural difference and economic disparity between the two wings. The seeds of independence were sown through the Language Movement of 1952 to recognize Bangla as a state language. Ultimately the then East Pakistan emerged as a sovereign and independent state of Bangladesh in 1971 after nine month – long war of Liberation (starting on 26 March 1971) in which 3 million people courted martyrdom.</p>

<p>The name Kuakata have originated from Kua-Well dug on the sea shore by the early Rakhine settlers in quest of collecting drinking water, who landed on Kuakata coast after explled from Arakan by Moughals. Afterwards, it has become a tradition of digging Kua-Well in the neighbourhood of Rakhaine homestead for collection water for drinking purpose and general use.</p>
<p><b><i>TOURIST ATTRACTIONS:</i></b></p>
<p>Kuakata is one of the rarest places which has the unique beauty of offering the full view of the rising and setting of crimson sun in the water of the Bay of Bengal in a calm environment. That perhaps makes kuakata one of the world’s unique beaches. The long and wide beach at Kuakata has a typical natural setting.

<p><b><i>Beach sites: </i></b>Kuakata sea beach is a nature of beauty. It is about 18 km long &amp; 3.5 km wide. The tourist, who came here, can see the Sunrise &amp; Sunset from the same place. It’s a great opportunity &amp; in the world this type of opportunity is only in Japan. The sea beach is surrounded by green trees &amp; beside the beach, there are many wooden trees garden &amp; forest, like The Foyej Miyar Coconut Garden, Lembur Chor, Jhauban, Gangamotir Chor etc. These gardens &amp; forests are the most attracting part for the tourist. There are no quicksands in the beach. So the tourists can frequently run, take bath, swim, &amp; pick up cockle from the beach. But there is no signal light to alert, no enough sitting place on the beach, no life jacket, no coast guard &amp; life saving men to ensure security for the tourist.</p>
<p>There are two rivers; named Payra &amp; Bishkhali are west of the beach &amp; a river named Agunmukha is East of the beach. They all are concentrated in the Bay of Bengal. This entire river made a channel about half kilometer outside from the beach. This half-kilometer is about 3-4 feet deep &amp; the channel is about 14-15 feet deep. This channel is about half kilometer &amp; after the channel the height of the water is again 3-4 feet, it is about 2-3 kilometer. Now days, the beach is consequently breaking down by the flow of water through the channel. So, if the government could not take necessary steps to save this beach recently then our country may lose a valuable tourist spot.</p>
<p><b><i>Rakhain Polly: </i></b>It is not sure at which time people started to live in Kuakata. But everybody believes that Rakhain community was the oldest inhabitants here. Once upon a time Rakhains were the majority here but now they became the minority. But they have maintained their history, culture, with in this Rakhain Polly. If you go there you can watch their life style &amp; daily work very closely.</p>
<p>Generally Rakhain’s life style &amp; cultural activities are different than ours. They are “Buddhist” in religion &amp; “Buddha Purnima” is their main religion festival around the year. Their every home has an own embodiment. Most of women are engaged in making handicraft. They made Lunge, Scarf, and Shawl etc. They have an own market in Kuakata, named “Rakhain Mohila Market”. They bring materials from Burma &amp; Cox-bazar. Men are engaged in agriculture. Most of them are not educated. Often people of other culture interrupt their life style &amp; religion. So most of them are contracted in mind because they think they are small in number in our country.</p>
<p><b><i>Sima Buddha Temple: </i></b>It is situated near the sea beach. The temple is made of wood &amp; tin. It cannot be accurately said at which time it was built. But it can be surely said that it is very o;ld. In the temple there is statue of Buddha made by eight metal situated on a three foot high stand. It is second embodiment in south Asia.</p>
<p><b><i>Coconut Grove &amp; Jhaubon: </i></b>The coconut grove was built on 200 acre areas around sea beach in 1960’s decade. But for the continuous &amp; unprotect able breaking of beach a part of the grove has already lost. At the east side of the grove there is a beautiful Jhaubon (on 15 hector) made by the forest department. At the sunlight of evening &amp; at the moonlight the coconut grove &amp; jhaubon look very beautiful. At the daytime, the continuous whizzing sound of Jhaubon hears very nice to visitors.</p>
<p><b><i>Fatrar Chor: </i></b>At the west side of the beach there is a small Island named Fatrar Chor (99705.07), a mangrove forest. People started to call it the “Second Sundorbon”. Keuya, Gauya, Goran golpata etc type of mangrove trees are seen there. There are also many birds &amp; animals like monkeys, pigs etc.</p>
<p><b><i>Gongamotir Chor: </i></b>Another attractive place for the tourists is Gongamotir Chor, which is 10 km east of Kuakata’s main land. Though it is less known to visitors for poor communication, the most attractive place here is the “Gongamotir Lake”. There are many trees like Keuya, Gauya, Saila etc many animals like wild pig, monkeys etc.</p>

<p><b><i>Rasmela: </i></b>The word “Rus” mainly came from the word “Ros”. This festival was started depending on collecting “ros” in winter; later the festival name became “Rasmela”. It is one of the main religious programs of “Monipuri”. At the time of “Rasmela” festival many visitors came here to enjoy it.</p>
<p><b><i>Shutki Polly: </i></b>Shutki Polly is 4 km west of Kuakata. Fishermen catch many kinds of sea fish from sea during the year but mainly the fishes which are caught in winter season, are be sunned in process. This “Shutki Fish” is supplied in many places of our country, mainly in Dhaka. The people who like to eat “Shutki” but have not seen the process of drying fish; this can be a place for them to get experience.</p>
<p><b>8. Khulna</b></p>
<p>Gateway to the Sundarban abode of the Royal Bengal Tigers Khulnais an industrial town and Divisional Headquarter. The Mongla Seaport is close by. Some of the biggest Jute mills in the country are located here. Khulna is connected with Dhaka by road and boat and by air via Jessore. Accommodation and eating facilities are available.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Tourism Industry-The Next Driving Sector of Bangladesh economy</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Tourism and Bangladesh: Some Basic Ideas</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Tourism has experienced continuous growth and diversification to become one of the largest and fastest growing economic sectors in the world over the past six decades. This is one of the today’s most crucial, dynamic and charismatic international industry sectors. Tourism has become one of the major international trade categories. Now-a-days, the export income generated by international tourism ranks fourth after fuels, chemicals and automotive products. For many developing countries, it is one of the main income sources and the number one export category, creating much needed employment and opportunities for development. Tourism is essential for many countries due to its capacity to generate income through the consumption of goods and services by visitors and tourists, the taxes levied on businesses in the tourism industry and the employment opportunity for the service industries linked with tourism. These service industries include transportation services such as road, air and cruise ships and boats, accommodation such as hotels, motels, restaurants, bars and entertainment venues and other hospitality industry services such as spas, resorts, etc. The global economic and social changes have a great impact on tourism business development in recent years have given rise to new challenges and opportunities.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Before going further it is better to discuss about tourism very briefly. Tourism is traveling for predominantly recreational or leisure purposes or the provision of services to support this leisure travel. According to UNWTO, tourism comprises the activities of persons traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes not related to the exercise of an activity remunerated from within the place visited. UNWTO defines tourists as people who “travel to and stay in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes not related to the exercise of an activity remunerated from within the place visited”.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Tourism has become a popular global leisure activity in the world. If we look on the international tourism status then it will be translucent. According to United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), international tourist arrivals increased from 25 million to 903 million from 1950 to 2007. There were over 903 million international tourist arrivals in 2007 with a growth of 6.6% as compared to 2006 whereas it was 698 million in 2000 (growth was 7.3% of 1999). International tourist receipts were US$ 856 billion in 2007. The overall export income generated by these arrivals (international tourism receipts and passengers transport) grew at a similar pace, outgrowing the world economy, exceeding US$ 1 trillion in 2007, or almost US$ 3 billion a day. Despite the uncertainties in the global economy, arrivals grew at around 5% during the first four months of 2008, almost a similar growth than the same period in 2007. For the whole of 2008, a softening of growth is anticipated due to the uncertainties posed by the current global economy affecting consumer confidence and constraining disposable income. Based on UNWTO reports, most of the top tourism earners in 2007 are European countries while the United States remains at the top earner. Tourism has many fold benefits to us and our environment. In very brief, tourism fosters environmental awareness both among locals and visitors. It links to social and economic development.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The conservation of natural and cultural heritage of an area as well as to improve the living standards of its inhabitants is the major contributions of tourism. On the other hand, tourism has negative impacts too. Attracting a high volume of tourists can have many negative impacts, as for example the impact of 33 million tourists a year on the city of New York of USA. Tourism has many potential negative impacts to fragile environments. The environment can be affected negatively by cruise ship pollution in many ways, including ballast water discharge and by pollution from aircraft. Tourism may pollute the local culture and heritage which may induce the crime situation and behavior of the locals. To minimize those negative impacts and increase the benefits of tourism it is very important to practice tourism management specifically sustainable tourism management. By practicing (sustainable) tourism management, negative impacts of tourism can be tuned into benefits to the local and national economy as well as for the environment. According to UNWTO, the top 15 destinations absorbed 98% of all international tourist arrivals in 1950, in 1970 the proportion was 75% and this fell to 57% in 2007, reflecting the emergence of new destinations but many of them in developing countries. Visitor expenditure on accommodation, food and drink, local transport, entertainment, shopping, etc. are important pillar of their economies, creating much needed employment and opportunities for development of many destinations. Nearly 80 countries earned more than US$ 1 million from international tourism in 2007. It has been expected that tourism will grow relatively strong in Asia. The region has a fast escalating economy. The growth of demand for services is related to income and in the long run is even higher than that of income. This explains also the growth of tourism over the past 50 years, which may continue in countries such as China or India. In this connection, Bangladesh stands in an important position which has great potentialities in tourism development.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Though tourism and its business are ancient activities but its development and promotion has not yet been carried out. Tourism has been advanced dramatically in the world whereas we lag behind. The geographical position, natural beauties, biodiversity, history, culture and traditions, climate, hospitable people are the basic foundation of tourism development in Bangladesh which are in advantageous position for us. The causes of not developing tourism in Bangladesh are: lack of proper planning for long run, lack of efficient tourism manpower, insufficient government and private sector involvement, security, etc. Now we need proper and long-term tourism master plan based on strong tourism policy by involvement of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) to culture and practice tourism business in our attractive green country. Bangladesh has great potentialities to be an attractive tourist destination for both domestic and international visitors and tourists. By the way, we can harness the economic, socio-cultural, environmental and institutional manifold benefits of tourism to enrich our country from various corners. Bangladesh may adopt tourism as an instrument for poverty alleviation, environment awareness and education, participation, infra-structure development, i.e., sustainable development.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There are different types of tourism. Some of these types which are prosperous for Bangladesh are: ecotourism, community-based (eco) tourism, pro-poor tourism, mass tourism, ethnic tourism, adventure tourism, religious tourism, historical tourism, etc. Now it is emergent to take effective and practical initiatives to flourish these types of tourism to earn more foreign exchange as well as local and regional development of Bangladesh. The tourists’/visitors’ decision on selecting any tourist destination can be influenced by six factors i.e., locations, transports, attractions, activities, accommodation and catering services of a given destination. According to SNV (Netherlands Development Organization) there are some pre-requisites which are called 10A’s in short for Sustainable Tourism Development. These 10A’s are: Attractions, Activities, Access, Accommodation, Actors, Amenities, Affinity, Acts, Ability and Administration. We have to study those elements to find out the problems and solutions to make our country a safe, secured and popular tourist destination. We have not only the largest sea beach Cox’s Bazar and the largest single tract of mangrove forests Sundarbans but also many other natural, cultural, religious and historical sites and attractions which have strong potentialities to be unique selling points for Bangladesh. We have to go far away to reach the standards of tourism but it needs cordial and joint initiatives.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Overview of Bangladesh Tourism </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Tourism in Bangladesh is a slowly developing foreign currency earner.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It is true travel &amp; tourism is not an unmixed blessing for every country. Sometimes foreign cultures can be invasive and irreparable damage can be done to historic sites. In Bangladesh there are quite a few World Heritage sites and they remain especially vulnerable but with proper management of the places the threat can easily be averted. As for culture, vulnerability of Bangladesh is out of the question given the enormous strength of the nation’s cultural identity built over the course of hundreds of years. In fact, the benefits outweigh by a huge margin whatever curse there is of tourism, as far as Bangladesh is concerned. The country earned about $80 million in foreign exchange from travel &amp; tourism in 2006 and with vigorous promotional activities it can hope to increase substantially its share of the multi-billion dollar international tourist receipts. Moreover, more tourists and travelers would most likely mean more trade and investment and therefore more growth of the economy.</p>

Every year a number of tourists come here to visit this Cemetery</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>TRANSPORTATION OF BANGLADESH</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The transport sector of Bangladesh consists of a variety of modes. The country being a flat plain, all three modes of surface transport, i.e. road, railway and water are widely used in carrying both passengers and cargo. In recent year’s construction of a number of bridges such as the Jamuna Bridge, Meghna Bridge, Meghna-Gumti Bridge, Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge, Shambhuganj Bridge and Mahananda Bridge have been completed. The 4.8 km long Jamuna Bridge which has been opened to traffic in June 1998 is the eleventh longest in the world. It has established a strategic link between the East and the West of Bangladesh has integrated the country, is generating multifaceted benefits to the people and promoting inter-regional trade. Apart from quick movement of goods and passenger traffic, it is faci1itating transmission of electricity and natural gas and has integrated the telecommunication links.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>AIR:</b></p>

<p><b>WATERWAYS </b></p>
<p>About two-thirds of Bangladesh is a wetland laced with a dense network of rivers, canals and creeks. Water transport is the only means available in nearly 10% of’ the total area. The navigable waterways vary between 8372 kilometer during the monsoon to 5200 kilometer during the dry season. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority has been established by the government for maintenance of navigability of ports and channels while the state-owned BIWTC provide passenger and cargo services in inland waterways and coastal areas of the country. The entire coast along the Bay of Bengal is 710 kilometer long. There are two major ports in the country. Chittagong, the oldest port, has been an entry-port for at least 1000 years. The Mongla port in Khulna region serves the western part of Bangladesh.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>BUS/COACH SERVICES </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Road transport in Bangladesh is a private sector affair operating predominantly in domestic routes. Rates are among the cheapest in the world. Express and nonstop services are available to principal towns from Gabtoli, Saidabad and Mohakhai bus terminals in Dhaka. The Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC) also maintains a countrywide network of bus services. Recently they have introduced Dhaka – Calcutta – Dhaka direct daily bus services via Benapole, Jessore.</p>

Besides they offer transfer service for tourists between Dhaka airport and main city points or hotels.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>A CASE STUDY OF BOGRA DISTRICT:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In preparing my report I faced difficult problems to collect authentic and complete data about tourism industry. Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics has no data about tourism industry. I found data from Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation and some association like HOA, TOAB, and ATAB etc. Only BPC’s data is little organized. But they record data only on foreigner tourists. They have record of local tourist data who occupied their establishments (hotel/motels) only. At that time introduced to Mr. Khandker Shahnur Sabbir, one of the partners of Backpackers Club.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Backpackers Club is an organization that is licensed to provide tourism related services. But the uniqueness of its service category is that this organization is working on a pattern to provide INFORMATION SERVICE based on tourism sector of Bangladesh and has a wide vision to make it such a large body to provide world tourism information. There is no other company in Bangladesh which provides information service in tourism industry.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To organize the districts individually as a tourism potential Backpackers Club took an initiative to list all the tourism service providers of every district individually. And Backpackers Club considered the tourism industry as very wide by considering the industries which are indirectly related to the Tourism Industry, (Community Centers is an example).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The main objectives of such a job are to list all the tourism related organizations of each district (city area for the first time), and complete the 64 districts; to make a communication standard among the organizations; to make them share their businesses with others (which plays the main frame of a TI); and finally to make the list available to all the tourists and TI nationwide or internationally.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">From above data we see the present situation of Bogra district of tourism and hospitality industry. Only 1 tour operator is there which is very poor for development of tourism. In my field survey I found that the occupancy rate in an average 50 percent which not good. Also the accommodation is not sufficient for such a greatest archeological site.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I have already discussed earlier about the resource of Bogra i.e. Paharpur, Mohasthangar (the oldest archeological site) etc. The occupancy rate (50%) is not quite good. Bangladesh government can earn huge from Bogra through international and local tourists every year. Both Govt. and private sector should take some initiatives for increase local and international tourists in Bogra.</p>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li>At first proper and attractive promotion for Bogra specially Mohasthangar.</li>
<li>To establish an international standard archeological institute in Bogra for collecting foreign students, researchers etc. which will increase international tourists.</li>
<li>Development of amusement/theme parks for tourists.</li>
<li>Build more international hotel and restaurant.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b> SWOT ANALYSIS OF BANGLADESH TOURISM INDUSTRY</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Internal Factor Evaluation <b>(IFE)</b> Matrix summarizes and evaluates the major <b>strengths</b> and <b>weaknesses</b> in the functional area of an Industry, and it also provides a basis for identifying and evaluating relationships among those areas. An External Factor (EFE) Matrix allows strategies to summarize and evaluate economic, social, cultural, demographic, environmental, political, governmental, legal, technological and competitive information about its opportunities and threats. So, SOWT analysis needs for identifying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of a particular industry for knowledge and taking necessary action for the betterment of that Industry.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Strengths</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· People of Bangladesh are generally very hospitable and tourist friendly.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Security is not that bad as often projected by electronic and print media.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Domestic tourism is increasing steadily. Due to two-day holiday in the week, the trend of moving out for recreation has increased mainly among the middle class people of the society.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Awareness about tourist attractions among the local community is increasing.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Communication and transport system has been developed from north to south, east to west.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· The country possesses some unique archaeological sites, cultural heritage and eco-tourism products like the world’s largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans, the world’s longest unbroken sea beach in Cox’s Bazar (120 km), the oldest archaeological site in the Southern Himalayas-Paharpur, Mohasthangarh and world’s largest terracotta temple – Kantaji Temple in Dinajpur, and spectacular monuments and mausoleums of language movement and liberation war of the country.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Weaknesses</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· No revenue budget for the promotion of tourism development in the country.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Frequent changes of officials in the Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation’s management and its line ministry.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Absence of representation of civil society in the BPC’s Board of Directors.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Absence of a regular policy direction. Due to absence of proper policy direction, BPC or the private sector cannot receive any fund or loan from any quarter.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· There are some flaws in the law of categorizing the country’s hotels and restaurants. Categorizing of the hotels and restaurants as Star or non-Star is not under the jurisdiction of the BPC. Nontechnical hands or institutions are involved in this process.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Due to absence of a tourism law, the tour operators or tourism service providers can not be punished for any mishandling of tourists. Also owing to absence of law, tourism products cannot be protected or conserved, which is there in many countries of the world.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· The country often suffers from image crisis. The country continues to remain as an unknown destination to the tourist generating countries.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Opportunities</i></b></p>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li>It is easy to implement eco-tourism, riverine tourism, and spiritual tourism, as the country possesses enough opportunity to develop these types of tourism.</li>
<li>Government has formulated favorable foreign investment policy to attract overseas investors in readymade garments, leather goods, natural gas and petroleum sector and liberal policy for joint venture investment in tourism sector.</li>
<li>As there are hundreds of rivers crisscrossing Bangladesh, immense potentiality exists for development of riverine tourism in Bangladesh.</li>
<li>Bangladesh is located strategically in South Asia.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Threats/Constraints</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Unstable political situation created a bad image abroad, which should be taken as the biggest threat for development of tourism industry overseas.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Continuous campaign against Bangladesh by certain quarters as a fundamentalist country is another obstacle.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Unholy alliance between the trade union and political leaders, which disrupts labor discipline.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Politicization of administration</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Trade Union Menace in the organization</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Rapid growth of population is another big problem.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Findings of the Study</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>FINDINGS OF THE STUDY</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To understand and have a clear idea of tourist arrivals and earnings of a country, statistical analysis is a must. Contribution of tourism in socio-economic upliftment can also be comprehended by accurate statistical data. The tourism industry in Bangladesh has once again faced some difficulties in regard to visitor arrivals to the country. The compiled month-wise tourists arrival shows an upward and downward trend, comparing the previous year. Although there is a slight decline than the 2005 number of visitors arrivals, the country recorded 2,00,311 arrivals in 2006. Foreign currency earnings however from tourism registered again double digit growth of 23.07% (Table 6) over the year 2005, contributing taka 505 billion to the country’s exchequer reaffirming the resilient nature of tourism.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In 2006 arrivals from all the regions except south Asia recorded increasing trend. South Asia and Europe contribute (76%) while other region altogether contributed 24%. South Asia contributes 37.67% of the total arrivals to Bangladesh while other regions altogether contributed 62.33% (Table 11).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Seasonal tourist flow variation shows January, May, June, September, October and November to be the months with highest arrivals. The highest flow was recorded in July with a seasonal index of 153 or 53.39% above the monthly average. The month of April with the lowest arrival recorded an index of 73.54% (Table 7).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">International airports remain continuously preferred port of entry into the country representing 75.67% arrivals; the balance 24.33% used the land ports. Last year 67.22% and 32.78% used the air and land ports respectively (Table 8).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Contrary to the decreases in international visitors’ arrival in the country, domestic tourism continued to grow. The domestic market took full advantage of the two-way weekend and other government holidays leading to higher occupancies at all private and public sector accommodations.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Table 1 show that world tourist arrivals &amp; receipts are gradually increasing. Bangladesh earns 80 million US$ while top tourism earners USA earns 81.68 billion US$ (Table 2 &amp; 60). According to SAARC countries, Bangladesh stands 6 out of 7 countries in both international arrivals and receipts (Table 4 &amp; 5).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Occupancy rates of hotels and motels operated by Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation increased to 43.76% in 2006, up from 38.63% achieved in 2005. BPC also reported almost 14.14% more guest in 2006. Early estimates show almost 9,50,000 mostly Bangladeshi national visited Cox’s Bazar alone. Almost 92% of all the hotel guests were received by private enterprises. Moreover, the private sector stakeholders have invested millions of taka for the development of amusement/theme parks such as Foy’s Lake, Heritage Park, Fantasy Kingdom and Nandan Park for entertainment of both local and foreign visitors in the country.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For rapid development of the tourism sector, Government announced a National Tourism Policy 1992 and under this policy, a National Tourism Council has been formed. The socio-economic scenario of Bangladesh can easily be improved by capitalizing its enormous tourism potentials. Realizing the importance if this fact the government has declared tourism as ‘Thrust Sector’ in the Industrial Policy of 1999. With the compliance of the guide lines, set out in the policy, it is expected that a congenial atmosphere for investment in tourism sector will be created, where public and private sectors can actively participate in its promotion, earning of foreign exchange, creation of job opportunities as well as play a vital role on our economic growth.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The geographical position, natural beauties, biodiversity, history, culture and traditions, climate, hospitable people are the basic foundation of tourism development in Bangladesh which are in advantageous position for us. The causes of not developing tourism in Bangladesh are:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Lack of proper planning for long run</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Lack of efficient tourism manpower</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Insufficient government and private sector involvement</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Security etc.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Now we need proper and long-term tourism master plan based on strong tourism policy by involvement of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) to culture and practice tourism business in our attractive green country.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Role of Tourism on Bangladesh Economy</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b> BANGLADESH ECONOMY</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">According to the IMF list of 2007, Bangladesh ranked as the 48th largest economy in the world. The economy has grown 6-7% over the past few years despite inefficient state-owned enterprises, delays in exploiting natural gas resources, insufficient power supplies, and slow implementation of economic reforms. Half of GDP is generated through the service sector, nearly two-thirds of Bangladeshis are employed in the agriculture sector, with rice as the single-most-important product. Garment exports and remittances from Bangladeshis working overseas, mainly in the Middle East and East Asia, fuel economic growth. Although one of the world’s poorest and most densely populated countries, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh"" title=""Bangladesh"">Bangladesh</a> has made major strides to meet the food needs of its increasing population. The land is devoted mainly to rice and jute cultivation, although wheat production has increased in recent years; the country is largely self-sufficient in rice production.</p>

<p>The theories of Trade union:<br/>
Trade union is an important instrument of present industrial settings. But why it is originated. The answer of this question leads to the development of theories of trade union. Different writers have presented the following different theories of trade union</p>
<p>1. Social-psychological approach of Robert Hoxie:<br/>
According to Hoxie, trade unions grow out of the social psychological environment of workers. Workers who are similarly situated – economically and socially tend to develop a common interpretation of their social situation and a common, situation of their problems of living. This leads them to unite into a union.</p>
<p>2. Sociological approach of Frank Tannanbaum:<br/>
According to Frank Tannanbaum, trade union are the by product of an industrial society. Unions are reflection of workers spontaneous urge to re­establish their identity.</p>
<p>3. Protest approach of Pear, Dunlop and others:<br/>
Trade union is a form of organized protest against the evils of industrialization. The workers often tied their work distasteful and their expectation never commensurate with their expectations. As a result, workers form n union to express their resentment over the prevailing industrial system.</p>
<p>4. Industrial democracy approach of Webbs:<br/>
According to Sydney Webb and Beatrice Webb, TUs are the means of achieving industrial democracy. The workers think that, political democracy alone can not provide them the fruits of freedom of contract, freedom of association, freedom of opportunity etc. all of these freedom depends on industrial democracy. As a result, to achieve industrial democracy is the main mitt of a trade union.</p>
<p>5. Classless society approach of Karl Marx:<br/>
In Marx’s view, trade union represent a prime instrument for destroying capitalist class. Trade union emerges to struggle against the opposition and bring about a revolutionary transformation of the working class.</p>
<p>Criticism of these theories:<br/>
1. All the theorists gave emphasis on one single reason separately but in real sense, trade union emerges for all of these reasons.<br/>
2. All the theories ignored that setting disputes was one of the crucial reason for which trade union were originated.<br/>
3. These theories do not include all the reasons of developing a trade union of every industrial society.<br/>
4. In many countries, like Bangladesh, trade unions arc originated as a part of political extension which, was not identified by the theorists.</p>
<p>Advantages of Trade Union:<br/>
Trade union is a formal association of either employees, employers or professional bodies But the term trade union generally refers to the association of employees. The central focus is given to identify the advantages of trade union are summarized below.</p>
<p>1. To get economic security:<br/>
One of the important reasons for which employees join trade union is to get economic security on the job. The workers always want a permanent job with an adequate income and a trade union acts as a safeguard to protect economic interest of workers. As a result, workers spontaneously join in trade union.</p>
<p>2. To oppose management:<br/>
On the job conditions, condition of employment, job enlargement etc. should be fulfilled based on predetermined policy. But working conditions may be unsafe, management may cut wages or may interfere in workers personal lives. In such cases, workers alone cannot resist the action of management. Therefore, they join a trade union to oppose management collectively.</p>
<p>3. To communicate worker’s views to (lie management:<br/>
Workers want to communicate with management to express their opinion, views, hope, frustration and ideologies. But individually it is not possible for the workers as well as for management. As a result they join a trade union to consult jointly.</p>
<p>4. To get protection from economic hazards:<br/>
The workers also join a trade union due to fact that, they need help in time of sickness, old age, death; protection from suffering, suspension etc. In all such circumstances, trade union provides assistance to its members.</p>
<p>5. To get employment:<br/>
Sometimes the workers join a trade union because it is a precondition to get their employment.</p>
<p>6. To exercise leadership role:<br/>
Some workers join unions as an outlet for their ambition. They may asp leadership and find that the union offers a convenient vehicle.</p>
<p>7. To regain social life:<br/>
Since trade union helps the workers in regaining their social life, they willingly join trade union. It also helps the workers to raise their status in society.</p>
<p>8. To solve their problems:<br/>
It is another burning question for which workers join in trade unions. Since the workers face the economic problems (such as – getting insurance benefits) in their environment, they try to solve their problems jointly. This leads them to unite a union.</p>
<p>9. To fulfill basic needs:<br/>
According to Maklcyland, Human being has three basic needs: Need for affiliation, Need for power, Need for feedback. A worker tries to satisfy all of these needs through joining a trade union.</p>
<p>Disadvantages of Trade Union:<br/>
Describe the main weakness of trade unions in Bangladesh and suggest measures of overcoming these weaknesses.<br/>
Trade unions have not been successful over the year in achieving its goals. So the logical question comes up is: why do trade unions fail? The answer is: it fails because of its weaknesses and limitations of various natures. These weaknesses arc described below.<br/>
a. Too much political influence:<br/>
Trade union leaders of Bangladesh arc fully controlled by political parties. So they arc more interested in promoting the political goals than in advancing the workers interest.</p>
<p>b. Multiplicity of trade unions:<br/>
Multiplicity of trade unions arc serious threats to the healthy trade union movement. When any conflict occurs within the unions, it is not resolved amicably rather gives birth to new unions under new relationship. But all these unions never come to the active role united to do any welfare of workers.</p>
<p>c. Inter-union rivalry:<br/>
Multiplicity of trade unions leads to infra and inter union rivalry and thus worth their collectively bargaining of workers. So the unions never be able to get their expected demands from the management.<br/>
d. Weak financial position:<br/>
Most of the trade unions in our country are financially weak. 13mun union members do not pay their subscription regularly, as a result trade unions cannot provide any welfare work or other financial help the their members when they are on strike or in trouble.</p>
<p>e. Poor membership:<br/>
Mushroom growth of trade union is responsible for poor membership. And inadequate membership always weakens the financial position and bargaining power of unions. So the unions become ineffective to do their duty.</p>
<p>f. Lack of sincerity:<br/>
Most of the union leaders arc insincere about their duty and involved in corruption. Some of them are accused of taking bribes from managers, contractors, suppliers, loan receivers, job seekers and workers. Due to their dishonesty actually they do not have the courage to fight against any of exploitation or evils of the management.</p>
<p>g. Poor academic and social background:<br/>
The social, economic, and educational background of union leaders and workers is poor. Very few of them arc trained. They are not well aware of labor and industrial laws. As a result, they cannot negotiate efficiently with the management rather they have a fear of victimization.</p>
<p>Remedial Measures:<br/>
In the light of successful trade unions (Japanies and Western trade union) some suggestions may be put forward to make out trade unions strong and effective organization.</p>
<p>a. Bilateral collective bargain system must to introduce in each and every organization of Bangladesh and the union leads must be elected on the basis of their personal qualifications and capabilities.</p>
<p>b. The mushroom growth and multiplicity of trade unions, which are detrimental to the industrial peace, must be discouraged.   </p>
<p>c. The monthly per member subscription must be raised and collected regularly to make trade unions financially strong.</p>
<p>d. Union leaders and workers must be trained on the labor laws and fair negotiating procedures.</p>
<p>e. The function of trade union should be broadened and widened so as necessary.</p>
<p>f. Built management and union leaders should he sincere, honest and fair in dealings.</p>
<p>I think, if the trade unions of Bangladesh follow the suggestions, they will be successful in their activities.<br/>
Conclusion:</p>
<p>            Finally, trade union is an instrument of workers against the evils of industrialization. The workers think that they can establish their rights collectively rather than individually. It is an association of employees employers or individual workers. It is relatively permanent combination of workers. It ensures the security of the economic interest of the workers. Trade union helps to practice leadership. It wants to develop the relationship between worker and mgt. It ensures collective bargaining. But in our Bangladesh trade union faces difficulties for too much political influence inter union rivalry, week financial position, poor membership and to on. So effective and efficient measures should be taken to make the trade union effective, spontaneous. Bialateral collective bargain system must be introduced. Industrial peace must be encouraged, union leader and worker should be trained and trade union should be broadened. </p>

<div class=""featured-thumb"">
<a href=""#"">
</a>
</div>
<div class=""entry-content"">
<p>The words <strong>training</strong> and <strong>development</strong> are mostly used together in the corporate world and are seen as activities focused on improving the knowledge, performance, and productivity of the employees. However, there is a distinct difference between their meanings and implications, which are often overlooked by a majority of professionals.</p>
<p>Training could be a program organized by the organization to develop knowledge and skills within the employees as per the necessity of the task. Conversely, Development is an organized activity within which the manpower of the organization learns and grows; it’s a self-assessment act.</p>
<p><strong>Definition of Training –</strong></p>
<p>Training is the process of equipping employees in a specific organization with specific skills, competency, and knowledge so that they can be able to handle various tasks. Training practices are mostly done to new employees so, that they can familiarize themselves with the operations of the entity.</p>
<p>Training is often referred to as importing specific skills and behavior. The specificity is in terms of learning a specific course content or skill like a computer language, machine operations, playing tennis/football, etc. Training also helps the employees to change the conduct towards their superiors, subordinates, and colleagues. It helps to groom them for their prospective jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Definition of Development –</strong></p>
<p>Development on the other hand is holistic, often aiming at overall personality development. The content of a development program includes conceptual or theoretical inputs, perspective strategic thinking or focusing on behavioral aspects such as leadership skills, managing teams, groups, etc.</p>
<p>Development is not only limited to a particular task, but it aims to improve their personality and attitude for their all-round growth which will help them to face future challenges. It changes the mindset of the employees and makes them more challenging or competing.</p>
<p>Moreover, development is undertaken to help individual employees within the premises of the organization to have management skills after proving themselves at junior levels. Coaching, mentoring, counseling, job-rotation, role-playing, case study, conference training, special projects are some of the methods of development.</p>
<p><strong>Key Differences between Training and Development –</strong></p>
<p>The major differences between training and development are as under:</p>
<ul>
<li>Training is the act of increasing the skills and knowledge for doing a particular job.</li>
<li>Development is the overall growth of an employee to perform present assignments better and increasing the potential for future higher order assignments.</li>
<li>Training programs are organized by the organization to develop employees’ knowledge and skills as per their job requirements.</li>
<li>Development is not directly related to job requirements; rather it aims at the generic development of the individual employees in the long run.</li>
<li>Training is a short-term process i.e. 3 to 6 months.</li>
<li>Development is a continuous process, and so it is for the long term.</li>
<li>Training focuses on developing skills and knowledge for the current job.</li>
<li>Unlike, the development which focuses on building knowledge, understanding, and competencies for overcoming with future challenges.</li>
<li>The focus of training is to help individuals in the organization be able to handle specific tasks within the organization.</li>
<li>Development is geared towards ensuring that the people under the program are in a position of handling future tasks when they arise.</li>
<li>Under the training program, the trainer is tasked with the role of offering motivation to the trainee, so that they can work hard to ensure they acquire the skills and knowledge to execute the tasks required.</li>
<li>Under the development program, an individual is required to have self-motivation because external parties are not involved in ensuring that a person develops to be a future manager in the organization.</li>
<li>In training, the trainees get a trainer who instructs them at the time of training.</li>
<li>In contrast to development, in which the manager self-directs himself for future assignments.</li>
<li>Thus training is defined as a systematic, organized, and planned program designed to enhance employee performance and to give birth to a measurable change in knowledge, skill attitude, and social behavior of an employee.</li>
<li>Development is considered to be more general in nature and more oriented towards individual needs than the requirements of the duty and it’s mainly meant for managerial personnel. The most intent of development is to supply the worker with a chance to achieve knowledge and help him acquire capability beyond what’s required for the present job.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both training and development are required to figure hand in hand for providing the proper skills and knowledge to employees and help them get the foremost of it for both organizations benefit likewise as their own progression. When a company or an organization looks at an employee’s overall growth, but the job-related training, it also helps in building a more efficient, motivated, and productive workforce.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Introduction</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>In order for a trust to be valid,<br/>
the ‘three certainties’ must be present: certainty of intention, certainty of<br/>
subject matter, &amp; certainty of object – (Lord Langdale in <i>Knight v Knight</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>CERTAINTY<br/>
OF INTENTION: </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The intent will probably only be<br/>
found from words, either spoken or written. Unlike contract, the concept of a<br/>
trust is too complex to be expressed otherwise than by words.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The words expressed by the<br/>
alleged settlor must manifest an intention to create a trust. The mere fact<br/>
that a right holder has an intention to create a trust but which he keeps to<br/>
himself will not cause a trust to come into being – (<i>Re Vandervell </i>(<i>No.2</i>)).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The words used must objectively (as<br/>
per Lord Diplock in <i>Gissing v Gissing</i>)<br/>
show that the alleged settlor intended to subject the holder of the right, be<br/>
it himself or third party; to a legally enforceable obligation rather than a<br/>
moral one – (<i>Re Adams and the Kensington<br/>
Vestry</i>: ‘in full confidence that she will do what is right as to the<br/>
disposal thereof between my children, either in her lifetime or by will after<br/>
her decease’ – there was no intention to create a trust).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Compare: <i>Comiskey v Bowring-Hanbury</i> (‘in full confidence that she will make<br/>
such use of it as I should have made myself and that at her death she will<br/>
devise it to such one or more of my nieces as she may think fit and in default<br/>
of any disposition by her thereof by her will . . . . I hereby direct that all<br/>
my estate and property acquired by her under this my will shall at her death be<br/>
divided equally among the surviving said nieces’ – there was intention to<br/>
create a trust, as it seemed clear, that the testator intended his nieces to<br/>
take following her death.)</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Mere intention that another<br/>
should benefit is not enough – (<i>Jones v<br/>
Lock</i>: ‘I give this to baby for himself’ – there was no intention to create<br/>
a trust. <i>Maitland</i> points out: Men<br/>
often mean to give things to their kinsfolk; they do not often mean to<br/>
constitute themselves trustees.)</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The least equivocal expression of<br/>
such an intent will be found in the use of the word ‘trust’; although depending<br/>
upon the context, other words may serve as well. e.g. <i>Paul v Constance</i>: ‘the money in the bank is as much yours as mine’.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Requirement<br/>
of proof in some cases:<span style='Times New Roman"",""serif""'><br/>
Allegation of a declaration of trust regarding land, additionally needs to be<br/>
manifested and proved by some writing, signed by some person able to declare<br/>
such trust or by will – (<i>Sec. 53 (1) (b)<br/>
Law of Property Act 1925</i>).</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Allegation of declaration of<br/>
trusts in will, is required to be proved by signed witnessed writing – (<i>Sec. 9 Wills Act 1837</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Consequence<br/>
of uncertainty of intention:<span style='Times New Roman"",""serif""'><br/>
If such an intent cannot be shown, no trust is created and the person who is in<br/>
control of the rights becomes entitled to retain it beneficially. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Accordingly, if there has been a<br/>
transfer, the transferee takes it beneficially – (<i>Re Adams and the Kensington Vestry</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Where there is no transfer but<br/>
only a failed allegation of self-declaration of trust, the settlor simply<br/>
remains absolutely entitled – (<i>Jones v<br/>
Lock</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>
</p><p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>CERTAINTY<br/>
OF SUBJECT MATTER: </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Certainty of subject matter<br/>
comprises of two separate but related concepts – </p>
<ol start=""1"" style=""margin-top:0in"" type=""1"">
<li style=""text-align:justify;""><span style='Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Certainty<br/>
of trust rights &amp; </span></li>
<li style=""text-align:justify;""><span style='Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Certainty<br/>
of beneficial interest.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>
</p><p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>CERTAINTY<br/>
OF TRUST RIGHTS: </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The rights which are to form the<br/>
subject matter of the trust must be clearly identifiable – (<i>Re London Wine</i>: Wine bottles held on<br/>
trust, were not separated from a larger lot, therefore trust bottles were not<br/>
identifiable, as a result the trust failed , <i>Re Goldcorp</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>But, surprisingly in <i>Hunter v Moss</i>, a distinction was drawn<br/>
between trust of tangible rights and intangible rights; and this case still<br/>
stands for the proposition that, intangible trust rights need not be clearly<br/>
identifiable. (50 shares were held on trust but were not separated from the<br/>
others; it was held that, as each shares carried identical rights it did not<br/>
matter which 50 were held on trust.)</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Consequently it gave rise to<br/>
practical difficulties, as it does not provide answer to the problem of dealing<br/>
by someone in the position of Moss. i.e. What happens if he gives 50 of the<br/>
shares to his mother as a birthday gift; does he give away trust shares or<br/>
shares of his own? Even rule of tracing cannot provide answer to this. This<br/>
issue is not resolved yet.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Conceptual uncertainty about the<br/>
word used to describe trust rights/beneficial interest can mean there is no<br/>
valid declaration of trust – (<i>Palmer v<br/>
Simmonds</i>: ‘bulk’). However, where a court can determine an appropriate<br/>
meaning of the word used; the declaration will be valid – (<i>Re Golay</i>: ‘reasonable income’ – the court was able to determine<br/>
what was reasonable by reference to the beneficiary’s previous standard of<br/>
living).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Residuary estate is always<br/>
certain, because after satisfaction of all required obligation according to the<br/>
will the trust right can be made certain.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>‘Whatever is left’ trust is<br/>
uncertain – (<i>Sprange v Barnard</i>); as<br/>
it is not certain whether anything would left.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>A trust cannot be created unless<br/>
the rights that are to form the subject-matter of the trust exist at the time<br/>
of declaration.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Consequence<br/>
of uncertainty of trust right:<span style='Times New Roman"",""serif""'><br/>
If the trust right is uncertain, then no trust could have been intended by the<br/>
settlor subject to exceptions described by <i>Oakley</i>.<br/>
Thus, no trust is created.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Accordingly, if there has been a<br/>
transfer, the transferee takes it beneficially – (<i>Palmer v Simmonds</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Where there is no transfer but<br/>
only a self-declaration of trust, the settlor simply remains absolutely<br/>
entitled.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>CERTAINTY<br/>
OF BENFICIAL INTEREST: </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Where the trust right is certain,<br/>
but the interest to be acquired by the beneficiaries are uncertain, the express<br/>
trust will fail, and a resulting trust will arise in favour of the transferee –<br/>
(<i>Boyce v Boyce</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>However, such an uncertainty will<br/>
not be a problem in case of discretionary trust, as these are left to be determined<br/>
by the trustees themselves.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>CERTAINTY<br/>
OF OBJECT:</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>A non-charitable trust must have<br/>
ascertained or ascertainable beneficiaries – (Lord Evershed MR in <i>Re Endacott</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Where the beneficiaries are individually<br/>
named, it does not matter that the whereabouts of the beneficiaries in not<br/>
discoverable. In <i>Re Gulbenkian</i>, Lord<br/>
Upjohn opined that, in the case of a beneficiary of a class gift whose<br/>
whereabouts are uncertain, the trustees can apply to the court for a direction<br/>
to pay his share into court. In short, the problem is correctly thought of as<br/>
one confronting the trustees when faced with their duty to distribute the trust<br/>
rights, not as a problem concerning the very existence of the trust.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Note that problems of certainty<br/>
of objects only arise where the settlor uses a generic term to describe the<br/>
class. No question of uncertainty of object arises where the beneficiaries are<br/>
individually named.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>
</p><p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>TEST<br/>
FOR DETERMINING CERTAINTY OF OBJECTS: </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>FOR<br/>
FIXED TRUST:</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'> A fixed trust is one where the trust<br/>
instrument specifies the share each beneficiary is to take. For a fixed trust<br/>
to be valid the trustee must be able to compile a complete list of the<br/>
beneficiaries – (<i>IRC v Broadway Cottages</i>);<br/>
for the amount each beneficiary receives is dependant on the number of people<br/>
in the class. This is known as ‘complete list’ test.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>FOR<br/>
DISCRETIONARY TRUST:</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'> A discretionary trust is one where the<br/>
trustees are given discretion as to who, within a class chosen by the settlor<br/>
should receive trust rights, and/or how much each should receive. For a<br/>
discretionary trust to be valid, the trustee must be able to determine whether<br/>
any given individual is or is not a member of the class – (<i>McPhail v Doulton</i>); for they (and the court) need to know whether<br/>
the proposed distribution is within their power. This is known as ‘is or is<br/>
not’ test.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>McPhail<br/>
v Doulton<span style='Times New Roman"",""serif""'><br/>
abandoned ‘complete list’ test for discretionary trust as the amount each<br/>
beneficiary receives is not contingent on the number of people in the class;<br/>
and employed ‘is or is not’ test.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Sach<br/>
LJ’s approach to ‘is or is not’ test: </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The test is satisfied where the<br/>
class of potential beneficiary is conceptually certain (a class is conceptually<br/>
certain when the words used by the settlor or testator have a precise meaning<br/>
in themselves), it is no objection that it may be difficult to establish<br/>
whether or not any given person satisfies the description – (<i>Sach LJ</i> in <i>Re Baden </i>(<i>No.2</i>); this is<br/>
the preferred analysis). If however, there is no possibility of adducing<br/>
evidence to prove that anyone falls within the class, then the trust will fail;<br/>
even if there is a perfectly conceptually certain class. (compare, difficult vs<br/>
impossible)</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>It will be for the individual<br/>
person to prove that he is within the class. If he can’t prove it, he is taken<br/>
to be outside of the class. However, such evidential difficulty will defeat a<br/>
fixed trust, as it will mean no complete list can be drawn.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Megaw<br/>
LJ’s approach to ‘is or is not’ test:<span style='Times New Roman"",""serif""'><br/>
</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The test is satisfied if it could<br/>
be said with certainty that a substantial number of beneficiaries fall within<br/>
the class – (<i>Megaw LJ</i> in <i>Re Baden </i>(<i>No.2</i>)).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Megaw LJ’s comments were made in<br/>
the context of a conceptually certain class. However, it is not clear whether<br/>
he would require this too.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Criticisms<br/>
of Megaw LJ’s approach:<span style='Times New Roman"",""serif""'><br/>
</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>If this means that only those may<br/>
take who are within the substantial number, then it appears to cut down the<br/>
class contrary to the settlor’s intention; and reintroduces a version of the<br/>
‘complete list’ test.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Further, it gives no guidance to<br/>
the trustees as to the extent of any survey he must take of the class before<br/>
distributing, i.e. the extent of the consideration he must give to distributing<br/>
to those not within the ‘substantial numbers’, yet who may fall within the<br/>
class intended by the settlor.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Resolution<br/>
of uncertainty of object by third party: </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>An opinion clause can not cure<br/>
conceptual uncertainty, but may allow an individual to determine whether the<br/>
concept applies in any particular case – (<i>Re<br/>
Coxen</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Case analysis: <i>Re Wright</i> (a trust for ‘such people and<br/>
institution as my trustees think have helped me or my late husband’ – this was<br/>
an invalid trust as there was conceptual uncertainty and the trustee’s opinion<br/>
could not cure this)</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Re<br/>
Tuck<span style='Times New Roman"",""serif""'> (Wife of<br/>
any heir must be of Jewish blood and worship according to Jewish faith, in case<br/>
of any doubt the decision of the Chief Rabbi was to be conclusive – this was<br/>
conceptually certain; accordingly the opinion clause cured evidential<br/>
difficulties)</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Re<br/>
Leek<span style='Times New Roman"",""serif""'> (a trust<br/>
for such persons as the company may consider to have a moral claim upon the<br/>
settlor – this was an invalid trust as there was conceptual uncertainty and the<br/>
company’s opinion could not cure this)</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>FOR<br/>
POWER: </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>A power can be defined as an<br/>
authority vested in a person to deal with or dispose of property not his own. For<br/>
a power to be valid the done must be able to determine whether any given<br/>
individual is or is not a member of the class – (<i>Re Gulbenkian</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>FOR<br/>
GIFTS SUBJECT TO A CONDITION PRECEDENT: </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>A condition precedent is a<br/>
condition that must be fulfilled for a gift to take effect. On the other hand,<br/>
a condition subsequent is a condition of defeasance – the gift will come to an<br/>
end if the condition occurs.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>In the case of a gift with a<br/>
condition precedent that defines a class, an ‘is or is not’ test rather than<br/>
‘complete list’ test is appropriate, and the court will be liberal in<br/>
determining criteria for vague terms – (<i>Re<br/>
Barlow</i>: objects were ‘friends’ – this would definitely have been held<br/>
uncertain had it been a discretionary trust, but it was held certain for gifts<br/>
with condition precedent and therefore valid. It means a degree of conceptual<br/>
uncertainty will not invalidate such a gift). However, <i>Re Barlow</i> was criticized by <i>Emery</i>.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Consequence<br/>
of uncertainty of object: </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>In case of self declaration of<br/>
trust which fails for uncertainty of objects, everything remains as before.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>However, in case of a declaration<br/>
accompanying a transfer which fails for such uncertainty, an automatic<br/>
resulting trust will arise in favour of the transferor. Exactly why this<br/>
‘automatic resulting trust’ arises is a matter of great controversy.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>ADMINISTRATIVE<br/>
UNWORKABILITY:</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'> This requirement arises out of the abandonment<br/>
of the ‘complete list’ test and adoption of the ‘is or is not’ test for<br/>
discretionary trusts, and the consequent acceptance of validity of conceptually<br/>
certain classes which is huge.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>A discretionary trust can also be<br/>
invalidated for being administratively unworkable – (<i>R v District Auditor exp West Yorkshire Metropolitan CC</i>). However,<br/>
unworkabiltiy can be avoided if the settlor gives some instruction as to the<br/>
principles upon which the trustee should exercise their discretion.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The concept of administrative<br/>
unworkability is not clear as to what criteria will render a trust unworkable.<br/>
However it is clear ‘size’ alone should not invalidate a discretionary trust.<br/>
In <i>Mcphail V Doulton</i>, the extremely<br/>
large class of ‘relatives’ did not invalidate a discretionary trust. <i>Swadling</i> suggests the problem is not<br/>
size; rather absence of a ‘core class’ capable of being surveyed. If a ‘core<br/>
class’ of objects can be identified within the larger class to whom the<br/>
trustees may primarily devote their survey of objects before distribution, then<br/>
the trust will not be administratively unworkable – although no case has<br/>
explicitly stated this.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Administrative unworkability can<br/>
invalidate a discretionary trust but not mere powers – (<i>Re Hay</i>); because duties of a discretionary trustee are more<br/>
stringent than a fiduciary power holder (bare power holder has no duty at all;<br/>
on the other hand the fiduciary power has a duty to consider), and that the<br/>
beneficiaries of a discretionary trust have more rights of enforcement than<br/>
objects of fiduciary powers. However; this reasons are not convincing.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>CAPRICIOUSNESS:
</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>A discretionary trust or<br/>
fiduciary power (a power given to an individual <i>virtute officio</i>, such as a trustee) can also be invalidated for<br/>
being capricious – (<i>Re Manistry</i>, <i>Re Hay</i>); as this renders performance of<br/>
the discretionary trust or fiduciary power impossible. Unlike personal power,<br/>
fiduciary power holder has a duty to consider the exercise of the power.<br/>
Personal power holder has no duty to exercise it, or even to consider whether<br/>
he should exercise it.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>A discretionary trust or<br/>
fiduciary power is capricious, where terms of the discretionary trust or<br/>
fiduciary power, negatives any sensible intention on the settlor’s part, and<br/>
precludes any sensible consideration by the trustess or donees. </p>

oral evidence will be admissible to prove the existence of a trust. (However,<br/>
it should be noted that the reasoning in <i>Rouchefoucauld</i><br/>
is circular – it will only be a fraud if the defendant is a trustee, but at the<br/>
point where argument over admissibility is made, we do not yet have evidence<br/>
showing that he is a trustee!).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>However, this appears to<br/>
disregard the statute as the trust being enforced is an express trust, on the<br/>
basis that it is being proved by evidence of declaration, though oral.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>So, later cases like <i>Bannister v Bannister</i>, <i>Paragon v Thakarer</i> classified such<br/>
trusts as constructive trust, without giving any reason for such classification<br/>

<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>However, it should be noted that<br/>

one.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>‘Constructive trust’ approach<br/>
does not fit well in a three party case (where A transfers land to B upon trust<br/>

– B will hold the land on constructive trust for A not for C; unless he<br/>

– there is no trust at all in the eyes of the law (<i>Swadling</i>’s view – the preferable one).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>However, <i>Martin</i> suggests non-compliance with Sec. 53(1)(b) renders a trust ‘valid<br/>

<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The advantage of adopting <i>Martin</i>’s view is that, oral evidence<br/>
will be then admissible to prove the failure of the express trust, which will<br/>
then give rise to an automatic resulting trust. Such a result cannot be<br/>
achieved by adopting <i>Swadling</i>’s view<br/>

(Note, this section does not apply to the original creation of a trust, but it<br/>
is activated only when a beneficiary under a trust seeks to dispose off his<br/>
interest) equitable interest must be in writing.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>This section also does not apply<br/>
to resulting, implied or constructive trust – (<i>Sec. 53(2) LPA 1925</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The effect of non-compliance with<br/>
this provision is that the purported disposition is void. There will be no<br/>
disposition until the writing is executed.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>It is assumed in all the leading<br/>
cases (<i>Grey</i>, <i>Vandervell</i> and <i>Oughtred</i>)<br/>
that, Sec. 53(1)(c) is not confined to trusts of land only. But, <i>Sec. 205 (x) of LPA 1925</i> defines<br/>
equitable interest as ‘equitable interest …………… in or over land or in the proceeds<br/>
of sale thereof’. There is an argument on this basis that the leading cases in<br/>
this area were decided ‘<i>per incuriam</i>’.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>However, the better view is –<br/>
since the section specifically mentions land in parts (a) and (b), but does not<br/>
in part (c); the obvious interpretative conclusion to draw is that clause (c)<br/>
is not to be confined to land. Further, it is argued if proceeds of sale of a<br/>
land can be seen as an equitable interest for the purpose of Sec. 53(1)(c), why<br/>
other personality would not?</p>

v IRC<span style='Times New Roman"",""serif""'>: Where the<br/>
beneficial owner gives oral direction to the bare trustee, to hold the trust<br/>
rights on different trust that he also administers, is void unless in writing.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Sec. 53(1)(c) was designed to<br/>
protect trustees from false allegation by someone claiming to be an assignee of<br/>
the beneficiary’s interest. The difficulty for trustee in such a case is that,<br/>
if he pays out to the false assignee he thereby commits a breach of trust, and<br/>
consequently incurs a liability to the true beneficiary to reinstate the fund.<br/>
Since in <i>Grey</i>, the oral direction<br/>
came from the beneficiary himself, the trustee knew it was genuine. So, there<br/>
can be no question of providing protection to the trustee. Thus, it is<br/>
submitted that the subsection should have held inapplicable in this case.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>But, the HL in <i>Grey</i> took a literal approach to the<br/>
section. Lord Radcliffe said that the word ‘disposition’ in Sec. 53(1)(c)<br/>
covered all means and devices whereby an equitable owner effectively transfers<br/>
his interest to someone else. Thus, it is clear from <i>Grey</i> that, a direction to a trustee by the equitable owner to hold<br/>
on trust for a third party; or to transfer the interest to third party both is<br/>
disposition for the purpose of this section and need to be in writing to be<br/>
effective.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>As the oral direction was not<br/>
effective to pass the beneficial interest, it passed through the confirmatory<br/>
deed which was executed to testify the giving of the direction. So. Mr. Hunter<br/>
was held liable to pay tax upon this confirmatory deed as it passed beneficial<br/>
interest.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Mr. Hunter could have avoided tax<br/>
by following process: He could have orally declared himself a trustee of his<br/>
shares for his grandchildren, instead of transferring legal title to the<br/>
trustees. The effect of such a declaration would have been to create an original<br/>
trust, rather than disposition of equitable interest under a subsisting trust.<br/>
So, Sec. 53(1)(c) would not apply,  and<br/>
Mr. Hunter could have still avoided the tax. Further if Mr. Hunter still wanted<br/>
the original trustees to hold on trust, he could have transferred the legal<br/>
title to them in a subsequent transaction, attracting only nominal stamp duty.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Where the absolute beneficial<br/>

the passing of the beneficial interest need not be in writing.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Sec. 53(1) (c) was designed to<br/>
protect trustees. In a situation, where the legal &amp; equitable title is<br/>
vested in the same person (as equitable interest normally passes with the<br/>
transfer of legal interest) there is no trust and therefore no trustees to<br/>
protect. This is the reason why Sec. 53(1) (c) was held inapplicable to the <i>Vandervell</i> scenario.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Green<span style='Times New Roman"",""serif""'> points out – in <i>Grey</i>, though it seems that only the<br/>
equitable interest was disposed off by Mr. Hunter, but it is not true. The<br/>
legal title was in fact transferred from the trustees of Mr. Hunter to the<br/>
trustees of his grandchildren; though in this case they happened to be same<br/>
parties. Nonetheless, they were acting in different capacities, so equitable<br/>
interest was not divorced from the legal estate and both moved together. Thus,<br/>
the ‘purposive approach’ employed in <i>Vandervell</i><br/>
should have held equally applicable to <i>Grey</i>.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>In <i>Vandervell</i> the HL in propounding the rule of law might have ignored<br/>
two important things: First, it will equally apply to chattels, which can be<br/>
transferred out of the trust by delivery – the result is that a trustee may<br/>
give away trust rights on the basis of oral direction with no writing<br/>
whatsoever. Secondly, though a legal transfer normally includes the beneficial<br/>
interest, it is questionable whether it does in this case, where the<br/>
beneficiary has not expressed in writing his intention to give up the<br/>
beneficial interest. Without any writing why it should not be presumed that –<br/>
when the trustee T transfers the legal title to X, that X takes the legal title<br/>
because he has been appointed as a new trustee to replace T, in which case the<br/>
beneficial interest would of course remain attached to the property?</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>However, Mr. Vandervell lost the<br/>
case for the option to purchase, as he meant the VFTC to hold the option on<br/>
trust, but he did not mention who the beneficiaries would be. As a result,<br/>
there was a resulting trust for him. Thus, he was not able to divest himself<br/>
fully of the beneficial interest. Accordingly, he was held liable to pay tax by<br/>
virtue of Sec. 415 Income Tax Act 1952.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>An oral contract to transfer<br/>
subsisting equitable interest which is unique (called specifically enforceable<br/>

Accordingly the transfer takes place under the constructive trust. This<br/>

formal share transfer. The HL held that this document is taxable. Had it not<br/>

misapplication of or loss to the trust rights although he has no obligation<br/>
under the sub-trust. He could always choose to pay the original<br/>

<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>In any case, it is arguable that<br/>

the trust to the intended trustee, according to the proper requirements for<br/>
transferring that particular type of rights.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Once a trust is perfectly<br/>
constituted, the beneficiaries of that trust can enforce it against the<br/>
trustee, whether or not they have given value to anyone in exchange for its<br/>
creation. Like an outright gift, a settlor cannot revoke a perfectly<br/>
constituted trust, on the ground that the beneficiaries given nothing in<br/>
return. It matters not in the case of a perfectly constituted trust, that the<br/>
beneficiaries are volunteers.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Where the settlor himself is to<br/>
be the sole trustee, then no transfer is required as the rights are already<br/>
vested in him. Note, trust would be constituted, where there is more than one<br/>
trustee and the trust right has been vested in only one trustee – (<i>Choithram v Pagrani</i>: the settlor himself<br/>
was to be a trustee among others, but failed to transfer the rights properly to<br/>
the trustees. However, since he himself was the settlor, no separate vesting<br/>
was required in respect of him. Therefore, the trust was held to be perfectly<br/>
constituted, despite the failure to transfer the rights to the other trustees).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The issue of constitution arises<br/>
where the settlor wants a third party to act as trustee – in that case the<br/>

title. This can only be affected by the Chief Land Registrar, and he will do so<br/>
on the instruction of the settlor given by the completion of the correct form<br/>
of transfer and lodging it with the Land Registry.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>If it is a title to a chattel<br/>

<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Shares can only be transferred<br/>
(in a way similar to registered titles to land), by the appropriate form of<br/>

<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>In the case of public companies<br/>

<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>These methods discussed above are<br/>
also those which need to be used to make outright gifts of the various types of<br/>

inconsistent, with any argument that the settlor intended to make himself as<br/>
trustee. Same reasoning applies in respect of the argument that, failed attempt<br/>
to make gifts can be seen as having declared himself as a trustee – as seen in <i>Richards v Delbridge</i>. As pointed out in <i>Milroy v Lord</i>, if such arguments were<br/>
accepted there would be no such thing as an imperfect gift.</span></p>

TO THE GENERAL RULE: </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>There are six situations in which<br/>
courts have departed from the rule in <i>Milroy<br/>
v Lord</i> –</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Detrimental reliance: Where there<br/>
is an imperfect gift/trust, there may be detrimental reliance on the part of<br/>
the intended done/beneficiary. Detrimental reliance may lead the court to order<br/>
the perfection of the imperfect gift/trust – (<i>Dillwyn v Llewelyn</i>, <i>Pascoe v<br/>
Turner</i>). In the meantime, the purported transferor will hold the promised<br/>
right on constructive trust for the intended transferee.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Although, it appears both<br/>
conscious and justified, it might be asked why the law does not simply respond<br/>
by forcing the defective donor to make the donee’s loss (compensation) or to<br/>
give up his own gain (restitution) rather than making good his expectation.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The rule in <i>Re Rose</i>: An imperfect gift/trust will be perfected, where the<br/>
alleged donor/settlor has done everything in his power to transfer the rights,<br/>
but the transfer failed, because it required the assistance of a third party<br/>
which was not provided (such assistance is required to transfer shares or a<br/>
title to registered land, see above) – (<i>Re<br/>
Rose</i>). The alleged donor/settlor will then hold the rights on constructive<br/>
trust for the intended transferee.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The reason was said to be found<br/>
in notions of common sense, which is of course, no reason at all.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The rule in <i>Strong v Bird</i>: Where the alleged donor intends to make a gift<br/>
during his lifetime, but fails to vest the legal estate in the intended donee,<br/>
the gift may still be perfected, if legal title subsequently vests in the donee<br/>
by being appointed as an executor of the alleged donor (now deceased); provided<br/>
the donor had a continuing intention to make the gift up until death – (<i>Strong v Bird</i>); as it is not possible<br/>
for the executor to sue himself to recover the rights. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Following <i>Re Ralli</i>, in which Buckley J made reference to the rule in <i>Strong v Bird</i> in finding that a trust<br/>
was constituted when the property fortuitously came into the hands of the<br/>
trustee, it appears that the rule applies to perfect, not only imperfect gifts<br/>
but imperfect trusts as well.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The rule in <i>Re Ralli</i>: Where the alleged settlor intends to create a trust<br/>
during his lifetime, but fails to vest the legal estate in the intended<br/>

the trustee by being appointed as an executor of the alleged settlor – (<i>Re Ralli</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Although, this looks similar to <i>Strong v Bird</i>, it would seem to form a<br/>
separate rule, for it applies even though there is no continuing evidence of an<br/>
intention to give. Indeed, given that, <i>Re<br/>
Ralli</i> involved an unperformed promise to give, rather than a failed<br/>
donation, any talk of a continuing intention is nonsense.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>However, this was only an obiter<br/>
pronouncement of Buckley J. Further, there is much talk in his lordship’s<br/>
judgment of vague notions of conscience. Moreover, the decision is difficult to<br/>
square with the earlier decisions of <i>Re<br/>
Brook</i>, which was not cited to the judge.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Donationes<br/>
mortis causa<span style='Times New Roman"",""serif""'>: <i>Donationes mortis causa</i> (singular<i> donatio mortis causa) </i>also called<br/>
‘deathbed gifts’, are gifts that are made inter vivos, but which are condition,<br/>
only taking effect on death. If the donor revives and demands the property<br/>
back, he is entitled to it. The typical case is – where I hand you my Rolex<br/>
watch and tell you that, ‘if I do not survive the dangerous operation I am<br/>
about to undergo, the watch is yours to keep’.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The problem with such a gift is<br/>
that, it would seem to be a testamentary disposition, and therefore subject to<br/>
the provisions of the Wills Act 1837, which prohibit oral wills. Yet, the<br/>
courts have held such gifts valid.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The condition for the operation<br/>
of the rule are laid down in <i>Cain v Moon</i><br/>
– (a) the gift must have been made ‘in contemplation though not necessarily in<br/>
expectation of death’; (b) the donee must in some respect receive the property<br/>
in question before the death of the donor; &amp; (c) the gift must be made<br/>
conditional on the donor’s impending death.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>What does the requirement (b) means<br/>
depends on the nature of the property. In respect of chattels, the donor must<br/>
hand over either the chattel itself, or the means of getting control over it,<br/>
e.g. key of a car (<i>Woodard v Woodard</i>).<br/>
Where the subject matter concerns with chose in action, some ‘indicia<br/>
(evidence) of title’ must be transferred, e.g. in case of shares the delivery<br/>
of share certificate (<i>Dufficy v Mollica</i>);<br/>
in respect of land the transfer of the title deeds (<i>Sen v Headly</i>: the CA recognised a <i>donatio mortis causa</i> of land for the first time).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Unconscionability: Court will<br/>
order perfection of an imperfect gift, where it would be unconscionable for the<br/>
alleged donor to resile from his gift – (<i>Pennington<br/>
v Waine</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>However, no reason was given as<br/>
to why it was unconscionable on the facts of the case. It is not clear why the<br/>
gift has to be perfected, rather than compensating the relying party for his<br/>
loss or stripping the donor of any extra advantage he would receive if the gift<br/>
were now treated as invalid. Moreover, no member of the court in this case<br/>
seems to have noticed that the facts of this case were very similar to that of <i>Milroy v Lord</i>. Furthermore, the court<br/>
relied on <i>Choithram v Pagarani</i> as an<br/>
authority, but this was a case involving express trust, while <i>Pennington</i> was a case of constructive<br/>

any consideration for that – (<i>Cannon v<br/>
Hartley</i>). On the other hand, equity will not enforce a promise merely<br/>
because it is made by deed. In such a case, equity leaves the promise to his<br/>
remedy at common law.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The typical case we are concerned<br/>
with is that – where one person voluntarily (without consideration) promises<br/>
another (i.e. intended trustee) by deed, that he will transfer rights to him in<br/>
order to hold it on trust for a third party (i.e. intended beneficiary). Now,<br/>
the question is, can the promise be enforced where the right holder fails to<br/>
transfer the rights properly?</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Enforcement<br/>
by the intended beneficiary:<span style='Times New Roman"",""serif""'><br/>
The immediate problem for the intended beneficiary is that, he is not a party<br/>
to the deed. So, he cannot enforce the promise. However, there are three<br/>
exceptional situations, in which the intended beneficiary will nevertheless be<br/>
able to enforce the promise.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Where the intended beneficiary is<br/>
made party by statute: If the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 were<br/>
to apply to voluntary covenants (which is doubtful) then, the intended<br/>
beneficiary can enforce the promise by virtue of <i>Sec. 1 CRTA 1999</i> which provides that – a third party may in his own<br/>
right enforce a term of the contract if the contract expressly provides that he<br/>
may, or if the term purports to confer a benefit on him; unless on a proper<br/>
construction of the contract it appears that the parties did not intend the<br/>
term to be enforceable by the third party. However, it is doubtful whether CRTA<br/>
1999 applies to voluntary covenants.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Where the intended beneficiary<br/>
can sue under this Act, he can obtain any remedy that would have been available<br/>
had he been a party to the contract – (<i>Sec.<br/>
1(5) CRTA 1999</i>). This might be interpreted as meaning that the third party<br/>
may obtain specific performance, if the subject matter is such that the remedy<br/>
of damages would be inadequate. However, it is established that a volunteer may<br/>
not obtain specific performance. It is difficult to see why a third party, who<br/>
has not given consideration, should be in a better position under the 1999 Act.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Where the intended beneficiary is<br/>
within the ‘marriage consideration’: At one time, it was traditional upon<br/>
marriage for the woman’s father to set up a trust. The beneficiaries of that<br/>
trust would be the husband and wife for their joint lives, the survivor for<br/>
their life, remainder to any children of the marriage and in the event of there<br/>
being no children, to the wife’s next of kin. The wife would also enter into a<br/>
covenant, whereby she promised to convey to the trustees any rights she might<br/>
later receive above a certain value to be held on the same trusts, problem<br/>
ensues when she fails to do it.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Unlike common law, equity regards<br/>
marriage as ‘the most valuable consideration imaginable’ – (<i>AG v Jacobs-Smith</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The parties to the marriage and<br/>
the issue of it are within the ‘marriage consideration’, that is to say –<br/>
equity treats them as if they had given consideration; as the very reason for<br/>
entering into the covenant is to provide for the family. But note, next of kin<br/>
are not considered as within the marriage consideration – (<i>Re Plumptre</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>They are, therefore, able to<br/>
obtain specific performance of the covenant where the purported settlor fails<br/>
to transfer the rights – (<i>Pullan v Koe</i>).<br/>
<i>Pullan v Koe</i> also envisaged, equity would<br/>
not only insist on specific performance of the covenant, but also treat the<br/>
trust as constituted by way of constructive trust the minute the covenant could<br/>
be performed.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The doctrine of ‘marriage<br/>
consideration’ applies only to marriage settlements; that is settlements made<br/>
in contemplation of marriage. A husband and wife who are already married, who<br/>
set up a trust for themselves and their children, do not create a marriage<br/>
settlement; accordingly the children are not within any marriage consideration.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Trust of the right to sue on the<br/>
covenant: An argument has sometimes been made that, the intended trustee being<br/>
a party to the covenants, holds his common law right to sue on the covenants,<br/>
on trust for the intended beneficiary. If this argument is made out, then<br/>
intended beneficiary can compel the intended trustee to exercise his right and<br/>
sue alleged settlor. The assumption is that, the intended trustee would recover<br/>
substantial damages at common law, which he would then hold on trust for the<br/>
intended beneficiary.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>However, the argument is unlikely<br/>
to succeed for two reasons as illustrated by <i>Re Cook</i>. First, requisite intention to create a trust of the right<br/>
to sue will generally be missing. Secondly, a trust of the right to sue is only<br/>
possible in the case where the covenant relates to present, rather than future<br/>
rights.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Enforcement<br/>
by the intended trustee:<span style='Times New Roman"",""serif""'><br/>
Being a party to the covenant, the intended trustee undoubtedly has a claim at<br/>
law for breach of covenant. But, cases like <i>Re<br/>
Pryce</i>, <i>Re Kay</i>, <i>Re Cook</i> suggest that, he will be<br/>
prevented by a court of equity from suing the alleged settlor at law, because<br/>
to do so would give the intended beneficiary by indirect means what he could<br/>
not obtain directly.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>It might be argued that, in<br/>
deciding the point Eve J in <i>Re Pryce</i><br/>
went beyond the rule ‘equity will not assist a volunteer to perfect an<br/>
imperfect gift’, as the trustees were not asking for equity’s assistance,<br/>
merely a ruling on whether they had to sue. These cases have never been<br/>
overruled, though it should be noted that they are only decisions at first<br/>
instance.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Even if a court were to accept<br/>
that these authorities were wrongly decided, and accordingly were the intended<br/>
trustee allowed to sue, a further question arises as to what damages he would<br/>
recover; substantial or nominal?</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The normal measure of damages<br/>
will be loss of expectation, i.e. substantial damages. There is an argument<br/>
which says that the intended trustee suffers no loss of expectation, because<br/>
had the covenant been performed, he would now be a trustee and a trustee makes<br/>
no personal gain from his trusteeship. Thus, all that he is entitled to is an<br/>
order for nominal damages. For this reason, Eve J was correct in <i>Re Pryce</i> to deny the intended trustee to<br/>
sue the alleged settlor at law, but not for those reasons given in that case.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The problem with this argument is<br/>
that, it forgets that the intended trustee’s claim is being brought at law, and<br/>
at law, he would hold any rights transferred to him for himself and not for the<br/>
intended beneficiary; as the common law does not recognize trusts. Thus, in the<br/>
common law’s eyes he has suffered a substantial loss and he should recover<br/>
substantial damages.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Even if intended trustee were to<br/>
recover substantial damages, there is an argument that he would hold the damages<br/>
on resulting trust for the alleged settlor. The reason is said to be the<br/>
failure (for the reasons identified in <i>Re<br/>
Cook</i>) of trust of the right to sue on the covenant in favour of the<br/>
intended beneficiary, accordingly a resulting trust of the right to sue in<br/>
favour of the alleged settlor arises. Since, the right to sue is held on trust<br/>
for alleged settlor, so will be any damages acquired through the exercise of<br/>
that right. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>This reasoning justifies the<br/>
decision of <i>Re Pryce</i> as this would<br/>
appear that the intended trustee is immediately liable to repay the damages to<br/>
the alleged settlor, the person he had just sued to recover it. This<br/>
circularity of action is of no body’s interest.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>However, the difficulty with this<br/>
argument is that, any trust in favour of the intended beneficiary cannot be<br/>
said to have failed at all. It was simply the case that, no trust arose in<br/>
favour of him, because there was no declaration of trust in his favour. In<br/>
other words, the trust did not fail, only the argument that there was a trust.<br/>
The damages will instead be held by the intended trustee on trust for the<br/>
intended beneficiary, for the damages is simply the law’s substitute for<br/>
performance of the covenant.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>PROMISES<br/>
FOR CONSIDERATION: </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>If consideration in normal<br/>
contractual sense has been given in exchange for the promise to set up a trust<br/>
(or to make a gift), and that promise has not been performed, the promise will<br/>
be enforceable at law through a claim for damages or; if damages are thought to<br/>
be an inadequate response, by an award of specific performance in equity. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The promise cannot be enforced by<br/>
the intended beneficiary/done as he is not a party to it – (<i>Re Cook</i>). <i>Re Cook</i> was of course decided before the enactment of the CRTA<br/>
1999, and it should now be asked whether Sec. 1 of that Act might give the<br/>
beneficiary/donee a right to sue in his or her own name.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>PROMISES<br/>
AND DETRIMENTAL RELIANCE: </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Where a promise to create a<br/>
trust/make a gift, has been made and the promisee has relied on the promise to<br/>
his detriment, i.e. changed his position to his detriment in the reasonable<br/>
belief that the promise would be performed; equity (though not the common law)<br/>
will compel the promisor to perform his promise. Meanwhile, the promisor will<br/>
arguably hold the right in question on constructive trust for the promisee.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>SECRET<br/>
TRUST</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>A full secret trust (FST) arises<br/>
where a will states that some right is left to a person as an absolute gift,<br/>
but the testator has agreed with the person that he is to hold the rights as<br/>
trustee for another. There is therefore no mention of any trust in the will. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Example: A clause in John’s will<br/>
states – ‘I leave £1000 to Smith absolutely’. However, John had told Smith that<br/>
he is to hold the £1000 on trust for John’s friend Sarah. This is a FST, as the<br/>
will makes no mention of any trust whatsoever, and it appears to be an absolute<br/>
gift.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>A half secret trust (HST) arises<br/>
where some right is left by will to a person and the will states that he is to<br/>
hold the rights on trust, but the terms of the trust are not declared in the will.<br/>
Instead, the terms are agreed between the testator and the person. Therefore,<br/>
here the will mentions the existence of a trust, but not the terms of the<br/>
trust. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Example: A clause in Barbara’s<br/>
will states – ‘I leave £1000 to Steve on trust for the purpose I have<br/>
communicated to him’. Barbara had told Steve that he is to hold the £1000 on<br/>
trust for David. This is a HST, as the fact that it is a trust is mentioned in<br/>
the will, but not the details.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Now, look at the following<br/>
provisions of the Wills Act 1837 –</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>All testamentary dispositions<br/>
(that is, dispositions made in a will) must be in writing, and signed by the<br/>
testator, in the presence of two or more attesting witnesses present at the<br/>
same time – (<i>Sec. 9 WA 1837</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Gifts to attesting witnesses and<br/>
their spouses are void – (<i>Sec. 15 WA 1837</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Any alteration of the will (a<br/>
codicil) must be in the same form as the will, i.e. signed, witnessed and<br/>
writing – (<i>Sec. 20 WA 1837</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Thus, enforcement of secret trust<br/>
seems to be inconsistent with the Sec. 9 of the WA 1837, as the evidence<br/>
required to prove the making of the declaration of trust is not in the form<br/>
sanctioned by Sec. 9.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>JUSTIFICATION<br/>
FOR ENFORCING SECRET TRUSTS<span style='Times New Roman"",""serif""'>:<br/>
</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The earlier justification for<br/>
enforcing secret trust was based on ‘fraud theory’ developed in <i>Rochefoucauld v Boustead</i>, that is – a<br/>
statutory provision designed to prevent fraud, cannot be used to commit a<br/>
fraud. A legatee who takes on the basis that, he is a trustee, but who later<br/>
seeks to rely on the statute to take absolutely – would be using the statute to<br/>
perpetrate a fraud. Consequently, evidence not in the form sanctioned by Sec. 9<br/>
would be allowed.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>However, there are a number of<br/>
problems with this fraud theory –</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>It fails to address the point<br/>
that such evidence is inherently unreliable.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The reasoning of this theory is<br/>
circular, because it already bases on an assumption that a trust exists, in<br/>
order to allow evidence to prove fraud.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Most importantly, it struggles to<br/>
explain the admission of evidence in cases of HST. If the evidence is refused admission<br/>
there, there will be an automatic resulting trust for the testator’s estate,<br/>
and therefore no possibility of any personal gain by the trustee.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>For that reason, Lord Buckmaster<br/>
and Hailsham in <i>Blackwell v Blackwell</i>,<br/>
had to redefine the fraud which the courts were trying to prevent is not just a<br/>
personal gain to the trustee, but the defeating of the expectations of the<br/>
secret beneficiaries or the disappointment of the wishes of the settlor. But,<br/>
this expanded fraud theory is no less circular, than the previous ‘narrow’<br/>
fraud theory.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>An alternative theory is that put<br/>
forward by the HL in <i>Cullen v AG for<br/>
Northern Ireland</i>, and adopted by Viscount Sumner and Lord Warrington in <i>Blackwell v Blackwell</i>; which is now<br/>
conventionally called the ‘<i>dehors </i>(outside)<br/>
the will<i>’ </i>theory. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Lord Warrington in <i>Blackwell v Blackwell</i> said – “What is<br/>
enforced is not a trust imposed by the will, but one arising from the<br/>
acceptance by the legatee of a trust communicated to him by the testator, on<br/>
the faith of which acceptance, the will was made or left unrevoked”. Viscount<br/>
Sumner expressed himself in similar terms – “It is communication of the purpose<br/>
to the legatee, coupled with acquiescence or promise on his part that removes<br/>
the matter from the provision of the Wills Act and brings it within the law of<br/>
trusts”. Under this – secret trusts are regarded as inter vivos declaration of<br/>
trust by the testator; the only atypical feature is that, the trusts are not<br/>
constituted, i.e. the rights are not transferred into the hands of the trustee,<br/>
until the testator’s death. Their essence is the acceptance of a personal<br/>
obligation by the legatee.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>However, there are a number of<br/>
problems with this theory as well –</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>It still fails to address the<br/>
fundamental objection that the evidence the court admits is inherently<br/>
unreliable.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>It assumes a false dichotomy<br/>
between the law of trusts and the law of wills.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>It does not explain, why the<br/>
acceptance of the trust by the trustee should be important, there being no<br/>
requirement in English law that a trustee accept the trust imposed upon him.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Most importantly, it is founded<br/>
on an unduly narrow interpretation of what is a ‘will’. It assumes that the<br/>
‘will’ is the formal document executed by the testator. But, this is not what<br/>
the statute means by a will, for, as we have seen, prior to the Statute of<br/>
Frauds 1677, wills could be made orally. The ‘will’ mentioned in the statute is<br/>
the totality of the testator’s wishes as to the distribution of his rights on<br/>
his death, and the intention that certain rights be held on trust for others is<br/>
undoubtedly part of that ‘will’.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Note that, both the fraud theory<br/>
and outside the will theory are still in play, though some judges talk of the <i>dehors</i> (outside) the will theory as<br/>
representing the ‘modern view’, which explains the admission of the otherwise<br/>
inadmissible evidence.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>REQUIREMENTS<br/>
OF A SECRET TRUST: </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>In order to prove a FST or an<br/>
HST, the evidence must show: (1) the intention of the testator to create a<br/>
trust, satisfying the traditional requirements of three certainties; (2) timely<br/>
communication of that intention to the intended trustee; &amp; (3) timely<br/>
acceptance by the intended trustee of the trust obligation – (<i>Ottaway v Norman</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>INTENTION:<span style='Times New Roman"",""serif""'></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The principle here is the same,<br/>
as with any form of trust: there must be certainty of intention. Interestingly,<br/>
if an attempt to create a HST fails for uncertainty of intention, the<br/>
conclusion will be – there is an absolute gift on the face of the will; thus<br/>
FST will be a possibility.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>COMMUNICATION:
</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>For FST, the communication must<br/>
be made to the intended trustee, before the testator’s death – (<i>Re Boyes</i>,<i> Wallgrave v Tebbs</i>). The reason is, if the legatee did not know he<br/>
was intended to be a trustee, he could hardly be said to have accepted or<br/>
acquiesced in his appointment – (<i>Re Boyes</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>In case of FST, it is not<br/>
sufficient to communicate merely the fact of the trust to the intended trustee,<br/>
the terms of the trust must also be communicated to him – (<i>Re Boyes</i>). However, handing over the terms in a sealed envelope<br/>
which is not to be opened until the testator’s death would suffice, provided<br/>
the legatee knows that it contains the term of the trust – (<i>Re Keen</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>For HST, communication must be<br/>
made before or at the time of the execution of the will – (<i>Re Keen</i>: this is known as the ‘<i>broad<br/>
ratio</i>’ of <i>Re Keen</i>). In <i>Re Keen</i>, the testator gave a sum of<br/>
money to the intended trustees ‘to be held upon trust and disposed of by them<br/>
among such person, persons or charities as may be notified by me to them or<br/>
either of them during my lifetime’. This would be void independently of the<br/>
question of inconsistency discussed below. The reason being; otherwise the<br/>
testator would be able to change his will without the execution of a codicil. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>However, the difficulty with this<br/>
reasoning is that, if the trust really does arise outside the will, then a<br/>
change of mind over the terms of the trust is not a change in the will at all.<br/>
Moreover, it would seem strange that a communication post-execution be<br/>
acceptable in the case of a FST but not in the case of an HST. It should also be<br/>
noted that the finding in <i>Re Keen</i> is<br/>
arguably <i>obiter</i> as the secret trust<br/>
was struck down on a different ground; which is known as the ‘<i>narrow ratio</i>’ of <i>Re Keen</i>. Nevertheless, in<i> Re<br/>
Bateman</i>, the rule was applied as if no doubt could be entertained about it.
</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The ‘<i>narrow ratio</i>’ in <i>Re Keen</i><br/>
holds that, inconsistency between the terms of the will, and the evidence<br/>
sought to be admitted to prove the existence of secret trust; is fatal. In <i>Re Keen</i>, the communication was meant to<br/>
be done in future (‘may be notified by me to them during my lifetime’), but it<br/>
was already done by a sealed envelope prior to the execution of the will. This<br/>
inconsistency lead the court to hold that there was no secret trust.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Where there are intended to be<br/>
two or more trustees of a FST, but communication is not made to all, <i>Re Stead</i> provides that, only the trustee<br/>
to whom communication is made is bound, unless the trustees take as joint<br/>
tenants and communication is made before the making of the will. There is no<br/>
case law on this point for HST. In case of HST, the trustees will certainly<br/>
take as joint tenants, since legal title can no longer be held under tenancy in<br/>
common because of Sec. 1(6) TOLATA 1996. Now, if <i>Re Keen</i> is correctly decided, the communication will anyway have to<br/>
precede the execution of the will; accordingly all will be bound.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>A testator must communicate not<br/>
only the trusts and the terms, but also the identity of the right to be held on<br/>
trust – (<i>Re Colin Cooper</i>). In <i>Re Colin Cooper</i>, the testator attempted<br/>
to add further property to an existing secret trust, but did not communicate<br/>
about this additional property to the secret trustee. It was decided that, the<br/>
trustee held the additional property (not all, only the additional property) on<br/>
resulting trust, since it was a HST. Had it been a FST, the trustee would have<br/>
taken absolutely. Alternatively, one might argue that, once obliged, even the<br/>
fully secret trustee will hold the additional rights on resulting trust.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>ACCEPTANCE:
</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The rights will only be subject<br/>
to a secret trust, if the intended trustee accepted that he would hold it on<br/>
trust – (<i>Ottaway v Norman</i>). Silence<br/>
will count as an implied acceptance – <i>Moss<br/>
v Cooper</i>.</p>

OF A SECRET TRUST:</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'> In the case of FST, where the testator fails<br/>
to communicate it to the intended trustee before his death, then the trustee<br/>
will take the rights absolutely – (<i>Wallgrave<br/>
v Tebbs</i>,<i> Proby v Landor</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>However, if the legatee is told<br/>
that he is to hold on trust, but the terms of the trust are never communicated<br/>
to him within the testator’s lifetime, he will hold the right on resulting<br/>
trust for the testator’s residuary legatee or intestate successors – (<i>Re Boyes</i>); because, the legatee had been<br/>
told of the existence of the trust and hence, it would be fraudulent for him to<br/>
take beneficially.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>In the case of HST, the result of<br/>
any failure of the testator to specify the trusts will be that, the trustees<br/>
will hold the rights on resulting trust for the testator’s residuary legatee or<br/>

<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>PREDECEASE<br/>
OF THE SECRET BENEFICIARY:</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'> If the intended secret beneficiary predeceases<br/>
the testator, his interest under the trust would lapse, and fall into the<br/>
residue. However in <i>Re Gardner </i>(<i>No.2</i>) Romer J advocated that – secret<br/>
trusts are inter vivos trusts, so the rights should go to the beneficiary’s<br/>
estate. But, this decision is doubtful on the basis that, the intended trust<br/>
would not be effected until the testator’s death.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>PREDECEASE<br/>
OF THE SECRET TRUSTEE: </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>If an half secret trustee dies<br/>
before the testator, the trust will not fail, provided the terms can be<br/>
ascertained; as equity will not allow a trust to fail for want of trustees.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>However, the secret trust<br/>
doctrine seems to be based on an acceptance or acquiescence by a particular<br/>
trustee and it is because of that agreement that the situation is taken out of<br/>
the province of the statutory rules on formality, if that is right, then the<br/>
doctrine of lapse should apply and the gift should fall into the residue.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Under the law of succession, a<br/>
bequest lapses and fails if the legatee predeceases the testator. As a matter<br/>
of logic, the predecease of a full secret trustee should therefore cause the<br/>
trust to fail. This was accepted in an <i>obiter</i><br/>
pronouncement by Cozens-Hardy MR in <i>Re<br/>
Maddock </i>where he suggested, if a full secret trustee dies before the<br/>
testator, the trust will fail and the rights will fall into residue.</p>

secret beneficiary witnesses the will – (<i>Re<br/>

<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Sec. 15 should not invalidate a<br/>
HST where the trustee witnesses the will, because the will itself shows that he<br/>
is intended to be a trustee. But, the <i>dehors</i><br/>
story says that, he is not a trustee under the will. So, Sec. 15 should also<br/>
apply to him as much as to a trustee of FST.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Of course, one might argue that<br/>
Sec. 15 should not apply to any trustee, secret or not, since none takes a<br/>
beneficial interest, but such a view cannot stand alongside <i>Re Young</i>, because that would be to have<br/>
it both ways.</p>

</p><p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>DISCLAIMER<br/>

<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>AFTER DEATH OF THE TESTATOR: In <i>Re Maddock</i>, Cozen-Hardy MR was of the<br/>
view that a disclaimer by the full secret trustee after the testator’s death<br/>
has the effect of invalidating the trust, seemingly on the basis that it<br/>
depends upon the existence of a personal obligation binding the trustee.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Despite obiter dicta to the<br/>
contrary by Cozen-Hardy MR in <i>Re Maddock</i>,<br/>
Lord Buckmaster in <i>Blackwell v Blackwell</i><br/>
stated obiter that a FST will not fail if the trustee disclaims the trust<br/>
subsequent to the testator’s death. This is logical, because the trust becomes<br/>
constituted by the will on the death of the testator, so it should not be<br/>
allowed to fail for the want of trustee. <i>Oakley</i><br/>
argues that there should be a constructive trust on the authority of <i>Bannister v Bannister</i>. But, <i>Bannister</i> was concerned only with a<br/>
question of admissibility of parol evidence to prove a declaration of trust,<br/>
and does not lay down a general rule. In any case, it would seem to be nothing<br/>
more than the imposition of a remedial constructive trust.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>In the event of a disclaimer by<br/>
the trustee in HST, it is assumed that equity will not allow a trust to fail<br/>
for want of trustee.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>BEFORE<br/>
DEATH OF THE TESTATOR: </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>A secret trustee is entitled to<br/>
revoke his previous acceptance of the trust at any time prior to the death of<br/>
the testator, provided it is communicated to the testator.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>In case of FST, if the testator<br/>
has had time to amend his will after the trustee’s revocation of acceptance<br/>
before his own death, but leaves it unaltered; the absolute gift on the face of<br/>
the will takes effect. On the other hand, if he had had no time to make alternative<br/>
arrangements before his own death, after the trustee’s action; equity may act<br/>
to prevent fraud or inequitable conduct on the part of the legatee by providing<br/>
a new trustee or compelling the legatee to hold the rights on resulting trust<br/>
for the testator’s estate. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>In case of HST, the rights will<br/>
be held on resulting trust for the testator’s estate.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>But note, since both the fraud<br/>
theory and <i>dehors</i> theory emphasise<br/>
the fact that, the trigger for admissibility is the acceptance of the trust by<br/>
the secret trustee, it can be argued that where acceptance can be revoked, the<br/>
justification for admitting the evidence contrary to the WA 1837 is gone.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>CAN<br/>
A SECRET TRUTEE BENEFIT FROM THE TRUST: </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Trustee of a HST cannot bring<br/>
evidence to show his entitlement to the trust rights, because to do so would be<br/>
inconsistent with the terms of the will, which identifies him as a trustee – (<i>Re Rees</i>). In <i>Re Tayler</i>, Pennycuick J stated <i>obiter</i><br/>
that he did not find this reasoning ‘easy’ and that in principle, evidence is<br/>
admissible to prove all the terms of the trust, including a trust in favour of<br/>
the trustee.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Swadling<span style='Times New Roman"",""serif""'> attempted to reconcile these two<br/>
cases on the basis that, in <i>Re Rees</i><br/>
the secret trustee was a professional one, being a solicitor; if the settlor<br/>
really wanted him to take beneficially then the trustee should have made it in<br/>
the will. On the other hand, in <i>Re Tayler</i>,<br/>
the secret trustee was just a friend of the testator, not his solicitor.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>In cases of FST, there is no<br/>
objection to the intended trustees leading evidence to prove that they were<br/>
intended to benefit in accordance with the intention of the testator, for the<br/>
will does not name them as trustees but as apparent beneficiaries; accordingly,<br/>
there will be no contradiction of the will. This was seen in <i>Irvine v Sullivan</i>.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>WHAT<br/>
TYPE OF TRUST IS ULTIMATELY ENFORCED? </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Whether secret trusts are express<br/>
trust or constructive trust, becomes an important question in the case of a<br/>
secret trust of a title to land; as Sec. 53(1)(b) LPA 1925 provides that only<br/>
written and signed evidence is admissible to prove a declaration of trust<br/>
respecting a title of land. Thus, many scholars and judges think that secret<br/>
trusts are constructive trust, to utilize the exemption set out in Sec. 53(2).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>However, secret trusts are<br/>
undoubtedly express trusts, since both the fraud theory and <i>dehors</i> the will theory are<br/>
justifications (although not very strong ones) for the admission of evidence of<br/>
a declaration of trust not in a form sanctioned by the statute.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>That does not mean that the evidence<br/>
of the declaration will be inadmissible, for the fraud theory in <i>Rochefoucauld</i> could be harnessed, at<br/>
least in the expanded form used in <i>Blackwell<br/>
v Blackwell</i>, to directly overcome the Sec. 53(1)(b) rule.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Moreover, <i>Paul Todd</i> argues, FST and HST depend on a principle of equity<br/>
which, if not defeated by Sec. 9 Wills Act 1837, will not be defeated by Sec.<br/>
53(1)(b) LPA 1925 or any other provision intended to prevent fraud,<br/>
irrespective of whether the trusts are express or constructive.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>CAN<br/>
A FST BE REVOKED BY THE TESTATOR<span style='Times New Roman"",""serif""'>?</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'> Whether a testator can revoke previously<br/>
declared FST and revert to the position as it is expressed on the face of the<br/>
will (i.e. an absolute gift to the legatee), depends on when the FST comes into<br/>
existence. If for example, the FST comes into existence the moment the<br/>
legatee/trustee accepts the trust obligation, then such an attempt will be<br/>
ineffective; as once a trust is created, the beneficiaries rights becomes<br/>
perfect (<i>Milroy v Lord</i>). On the other<br/>
hand, if the FST comes into existence at the testaor’s death, then clearly the<br/>
trust can be revoked at any time before the testator’s death.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Under the <i>dehors</i> theory, secret trusts arise on the testaor’s death. The<br/>
judgement in <i>Blackwell v Blackwell</i><br/>
and <i>Re Maddock</i> supports this view.<br/>
The logic of this approach is that the communication to the trustee during his<br/>
lifetime, and acceptance thereof, is simply an inter vivos declaration of<br/>
trust, and that the trust becomes constituted when the rights passes into the<br/>
hands of the trustee on the testator’s death. Thus, the FST can be revoked at<br/>
any time before death.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>However, if the rationale for<br/>
enforcing secret trusts is to prevent the trustee/legatee perpetrating a fraud<br/>
by agreeing to accept a trust obligation and then claiming the trust rights<br/>
himself; then this policy can be upheld only by deciding that the trust becomes<br/>
constituted at the date of the acceptance of the obligation. Such a view of<br/>
secret trust is implicit in <i>Re Gardner<br/>
(No. 2)</i> and <i>Sonley v Clock Makers<br/>
Company</i>. Thus, one might try to argue that FST is not revocable once<br/>
declared. However, it should be noted that, <i>Sonley</i><br/>
was a case of HST and <i>Re Gardner</i> has<br/>
attracted considerable academic criticisms.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>PRIVATE<br/>
PURPOSE TRUST</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Look at the following examples:</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>X transfers property to Y, for him<br/>
to hold as trustee for Z. This is a straightforward private trust, where<br/>
property is to be held on trust for a particular beneficiary, and it is of<br/>
course valid.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>X transfers property to Y, for<br/>
him to hold as trustee for charitable purposes. This is not a trust for<br/>
particular persons, and is therefore not a private trust. Instead, it is a<br/>
trust for purposes, and because those purposes are charitable, the trust is<br/>
valid, even though there are no identifiable beneficiaries.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>X transfers property to Y to hold<br/>
‘for the maintenance of good relations between nations ……….. The preservation<br/>
of the independence of the newspapers and similar purposes’. This is also a<br/>
trust for purposes, rather than persons; but here the purposes are not<br/>
charitable. This is a non-charitable purpose or private purpose trust.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>A private purpose trust is<br/>
generally void as – it does not clearly indicate a class of beneficiaries,<br/>
there is no one who can enforce the trust; and purposes generally do not expire<br/>
within a limited time, thus tend to violate rule against perpetuity.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>However, a power to carry out a<br/>
purpose is perfectly valid. There is no similar problem of enforcement with<br/>
respect to powers, for there is no duty to carry out powers, and so no problem<br/>
of non-feaseance. As regards misfeaseance, those who would take in default of<br/>
appointment have the power to bring the trustee to book, if he purports to<br/>
exercise the power in a way which is outside the intended purpose.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>TRUST<br/>
OR POWER OF APPOINMENT?: </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>It may be unclear whether a<br/>
settlor intends to impose a trust on the recipient or intends merely to give<br/>
him a power of appointment. Consider: ‘<span style='Times New Roman"",""serif"";position:relative;top:5.5pt;'><img height=""22"" loading=""lazy"" src=""file:///C:/Users/Papon/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image003.gif"" v:shapes=""_x0000_i1027"" width=""8""/></span><span style='Times New Roman"",""serif"";Times New Roman""'>100,000 to<br/>
my trustees for distribution to such of my relations as my trustees shall in<br/>
their absolute discretion thinks fit’ – does ‘for distribution’ mean ‘to be<br/>
distributed’, an imperative direction imposing an obligation upon them to<br/>
distribute; or is it rather to be interpreted as ‘available for distribution’,<br/>
thus creating no obligation but giving the trustees a power that they may exercise<br/>
if they so choose?</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif"";Times New Roman""'>Several<br/>
rules of construction may determine whether a trust or a power of appointment<br/>
is intended:</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>If there is an explicit ‘gift<br/>
over’ in default of appointment, e.g. ‘my shares in X company to my trustees,<br/>
with power to appoint to my children in such portions as my trustees shall in<br/>
their absolute discretion decide, and <i>in<br/>
default of appointment </i>to King’s College London’ – there is a power of<br/>
appointment, because if the settlor provides for the case where the trustees do<br/>
not appoint, clearly they are under no duty to do so.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Note, the ‘gift over’ must<br/>
specifically arise on default of appointment. A residuary gift is not a gift<br/>
over for this purpose. Residuary clauses deal with failures of all kinds;<br/>
nothing therefore can be inferred about any specific gift just because the will<br/>
contains a residuary clause.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>If there is no ‘gift over’ in<br/>
default of appointment, one must determine the true intentions of the testator<br/>
by construing the will, or settlement as a whole. For example, if the testator<br/>
uses words that clearly indicate his intention to create a trust with respect<br/>
to some of his gifts, but does not in the gift under consideration, the court<br/>
is apt to conclude that there is no trust – the testator knew what words to use<br/>
to create a trust and in respect of this gift did not (see <i>Re Week</i>). </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The settlor’s use of word ‘power’<br/>
is not determinative, but words such as ‘shall’ or ‘to be’ as in ‘shall<br/>
distribute’ or ‘to be divided amongst’, seem quite clearly to be imperative,<br/>
strongly indicating the imposition of a duty, and thus a trust.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The court will not, however,<br/>
validate a purpose trust by construing it as valid power for purposes – (<i>Re Shaw</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>EXAMPLES<br/>
OF SOME ANOMALOUS VALID PURPOSE TRUSTS:</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Trust for monument and graves: A<br/>
trust for the erection or maintenance of monuments or graves with reasonable<br/>
provision is valid – (<i>Mussett v Bingle</i>,<br/>
<i>Re Hooper</i>); but not with very general<br/>
provisions, such as ‘some useful memorial to myself’ – (<i>Re Endacott</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>These trusts can be charitable,<br/>
where they are for a tomb which can be regarded as part of the fabric of the<br/>
church – (<i>Hoare v Osborne</i>); or for<br/>
the maintenance of a churchyard in general – (<i>Re Vaughan</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Trust for individual animals: A<br/>
trust for the benefit of specific animal is valid – (<i>Re Dean</i>: This case is somewhat dubious on perpetuity ground. This<br/>
was not clearly discussed). Trust for animals in general, or particular species<br/>
is valid as charitable trusts.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Trust for the saying of masses: A<br/>
trust for the saying of masses in private is valid – (<i>Bourne v Keane</i>). Trust for the saying of masses in public is valid<br/>
as charitable trusts – (<i>Re Hetherington</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Apart from these situations,<br/>
there are few more instances where private purpose trust was held valid; but<br/>
these are not relevant for exam purpose. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>It is clear that the courts will<br/>
not allow any new exceptions, and will not extend the existing categories – (<i>Re Endacott</i>, <i>Re Astor</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>One important point to note that,<br/>
yet these trusts have to comply with the rule against perpetuity to be valid.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Where an anomalous trust of one<br/>
of these kinds is upheld, the court will make a <i>Pettingall</i> order (<i>Pettingall<br/>
v Pettingall</i>) under which the trustee or executor of the will undertakes to<br/>
carry out the purpose, and the court grants leave to those persons who would<br/>
receive the funds if the gift had been declared invalid, to approach the court,<br/>
if the trustee or executor fails to carry out the purpose or misuses the fund.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>
</p><p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>TRUST<br/>
FOR PERSONS LIMITED BY A PURPOSE: </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Where the beneficiary’s interest<br/>
under the trust is determined by the expense of a certain benefit for him (e.g.<br/>
trust for advancement, education, maintenance of settlor’s son), these are not<br/>
purpose trusts, rather trust for persons limited by a purpose – often termed as<br/>
‘<i>Re Sanderson</i>’ type trust.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Accordingly, the trust may<br/>
exhaust any funds set aside for it, or may fail to exhaust those funds. In case<br/>
of <i>Re Sanderson</i> type trust, the<br/>
beneficiary only has a right under the trust commensurate with the named<br/>
expense; and any remaining funds must be disposed of by way of a gift over, or<br/>
will otherwise go under an automatic resulting trust.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The principle of construction was<br/>
laid down in <i>Re Sanderson</i> as follows:<br/>
‘if a gross sum be given, or if the whole income of the property be given, and<br/>
a special purpose be assigned for that gift, the court always regards the gift<br/>
as absolute, and the purpose merely as the motive for the gift, and therefore<br/>
holds that the gift takes effect as to the whole sum or the whole income, as<br/>
the case may be.’</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Thus, in <i>Re Andrew</i> and <i>Re Osoba</i>,<br/>
the beneficiary was allowed to take the surpluses. But in <i>Re Abbott</i> a true <i>Re Sanderson</i><br/>
type trust was found, on the basis that the beneficiaries in that case had<br/>
died. Accordingly, there was a resulting trust in favour of the testator’s<br/>
estate.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>RE DENLEY APPROACH: A trust for<br/>
non-charitable purpose which would otherwise be void may nevertheless be<br/>
upheld, if the purpose is not of an abstract kind, rather it directly or<br/>
indirectly confers benefit to ascertained/ascertainable individuals – (<i>Re Denley</i>: the case concerned a land<br/>
which was to be held on trust ‘for the purpose of a recreation or sports ground<br/>
primarily for the benefit of the employees of the company and secondarily for<br/>
the benefit of such other person or persons (if any) as the trustees may allow to<br/>
use the same’). Note, these trusts yet have to comply with the rule against<br/>
perpetuity.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Subsequent commentary has tended<br/>
to treat the case as merely one of a particular kind of discretionary trust<br/>
(see <i>Re Grant</i>); or as a trust for<br/>
persons, with the purpose being treated merely as a ‘superadded’ direction or<br/>
motive for the gift (see <i>Re Lipinski</i>).<br/>
In other words, the case appears to have been read so as to deny that it<br/>
represents a departure from the beneficiary principle. The case of <i>Re Denley</i> therefore remains a dubious<br/>
one.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>
</p><p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>UNINCORPORATED<br/>
ASSOCIATION (UA)</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>An UA exists where two or more<br/>
persons are bound together for one or more common purpose by mutual<br/>
understandings, each having mutual duties and obligations, in an organization<br/>
which has rules identifying in whom control of the organization and its funds<br/>
is vested, and which can be joined or left at will – (<i>Conservative and Unionist v Burrell</i>).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>UA is one of interest here<br/>
because, if an individual wishes to devote his money to the carrying out of a<br/>
purpose, in particular after his death, then one way of doing so, is to give<br/>
money to an UA the purpose of which is the same of the transferor.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>But the problem is, UA itself has<br/>
no legal personality, and so has no capacity to hold rights. Such a transfer to<br/>
UA, thus, appears to be void, as a transfer of rights to a tree or pet cat<br/>
would be.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>However, the court found a way of<br/>
validating such transfers as people insist on trying to transfer rights to UA.<br/>
Their method is to say that, though the association itself has no legal<br/>
personality, its members or more often its officers do. The transfer is,<br/>
therefore, construed as one to the members or officers of the association.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>
</p><p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>CONSTRUCTION<br/>
OF A GIFT TO UA:</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'> Initially, the courts viewed such transfers as<br/>
made to all the members personally (either directly as co-owner of the right;<br/>
or through the medium of a trust, the treasurer or other officers of the club<br/>
acting as trustees). This interpretation would allow each member of the<br/>
association to claim their share of the right, and use it as they wished.<br/>
Obviously, this would have been against the intention of the donor. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>This problem led the court to<br/>
regard the transfer as made to the members on trust not for themselves, but for<br/>
the purpose of the association. This interpretation turned out to be a<br/>
disastrous for the transferor. Because, the transfer would have been invalid as<br/>
a private purpose trust, unless the purposes were exclusively charitable, or a<br/>
type falling within the <i>Re Denley</i><br/>
principle.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>
</p><p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The more recent and preferable approach<br/>
is to construe such transfers as made to the members themselves, but subject to<br/>
their contractual obligation between themselves to use the rights so given, to<br/>
promote the purpose of the association – (<i>Re<br/>
Recher</i>, <i>Re Liplinski</i>). This is<br/>
known as the ‘contract-holding theory’.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>This construction works, as it<br/>
uses a contract to control the expenditure of the fund, rather than the terms<br/>
of a trust, so that the carrying out of the purpose is enforced by way of<br/>
compliance with a contract, not by way of a trustee’s carrying out a private<br/>
purpose trust.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>However, there are two versions<br/>
of this theory – purely contractual approach &amp; bare trust/contractual<br/>
mandate solution.  </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Purely Contractual Approach: This<br/>
has been interpreted to mean – the members all individually hold the rights as<br/>
co-owners, so there is no trust, but they are bound by their contract between<br/>
themselves, to deal with the rights as decided by the association rules. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The problem with such a purely<br/>
contractual approach is that, a person cannot give rights subject to another’s<br/>
contract (i.e. you cannot give a friend rights to be held on the terms of a<br/>
contract with another party, for a contract is a personal obligation between<br/>
individuals, and you are not a privy to their contract). Although, <i>Matthews</i> provided a solution to this (by<br/>
incorporating a provision to the association’s rules that any gift or<br/>
contractual payment received are taken members individually subject to their<br/>
contract); this seems fanciful.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Bare Trust/Contractual Mandate<br/>
Solution: The best interpretation is – the rights are held as an ‘accretion to<br/>
the funds of the association’; which means such transfers are construed as a<br/>
gift to the treasurer-trustee of the UA, to hold the rights on the same trust<br/>
as he does the other rights of the UA.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>One thing to note in particular,<br/>
the contract-holding theory does not ensure that a donor who donates money to<br/>
an association for the use of the association in its activities will get his<br/>
wish, for an association may always change its rules or goals, and thus devote<br/>
its funds to other activities, or even to decide disband and split up the<br/>
remaining funds at any given time. In light of this, <i>Swadling</i> has proposed that, a disgruntled donor may claim that his<br/>
gift was made on condition that it be used for a specified purpose. This is not<br/>
a transfer on purpose trust, but a conditional gift recognized at common law.<br/>
If this construction can be put on the gift, and the gift is not devoted to the<br/>
purpose, the donor can bring a personal action under the law of unjust<br/>
enrichment, for restitution of an equivalent sum.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Another possibility which is<br/>
related to the mandate idea is to utilize the type of trust upheld by the HL in<br/>
<i>Barclays Bank v Quistclose</i>, as a<br/>
means of achieving an abstract purpose trust. According to Lord Millett’s<br/>
analysis, a borrower holds rights on resulting trust for the lender but with a<br/>
power (or in some case, a duty) to carry out the lender’s revocable mandate. It<br/>
is not a purpose trust, but simply a trust subject to a power to apply the rights<br/>
for a purpose.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>To achieve the bare<br/>
trust/contractual mandate solution, the courts have been prepared to ignore<br/>
words which in other contexts would suggest that a true purpose trust is<br/>
intended (for example, ‘solely’ in <i>Re<br/>
Lipinski</i>). In <i>Re Lipinski</i>, Oliver<br/>
J reasoned that, since a valid gift may be made to an UA as a simple accretion<br/>
to the funds, why should a gift specifying a purpose be invalid? He also<br/>
considered the expressed purpose could be treated merely as a motive for the<br/>
gift, not as a trust obligation. Alternatively, he said that the gift could be<br/>
held valid on the authority of <i>Re Denley</i>.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>But, the court will not construe<br/>
a gift as one to the members, where the members do not have complete control of<br/>
the rules of the association – (<i>Re Grant</i>:<br/>
the testator left his entire real and personal estate to the Chertsey and<br/>
Walton Constituency Labour Party. Its rules were capable of being altered by an<br/>
outside body, the National Labour Party. Accordingly, the gift failed).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>THE<br/>
CONSTRUCTION OF TRANSFERS TO POLITICAL PARTIES: </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>In <i>Re Grant</i>, Vinelott J held that the local Labour Party was not an<br/>
UA, as its rules were capable of being altered by the National Labour Party.<br/>
But, this reasoning is doubtful. In <i>Conservative<br/>
and Unionist v Burrell</i>, the court held that, political parties are<br/>
‘political movements’, not UA. Since, movements do not have the membership of<br/>
an association, the bare trust/contractual mandate solution could not work.<br/>
But, again it is not clear, why political parties cannot be associations with a<br/>
definite membership, even if they are political.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Instead, in <i>Burrell</i> the court explains a gift to the party as given under an<br/>
agency arrangement, the treasurer of the party to use the funds for the<br/>
purposes of the party, as an agent of the donor. This construction in<br/>
unsatisfactory in more ways than one, failing in particular to account for<br/>
testamentary gifts, for when a will comes into operation the testator is dead,<br/>
and a dead person cannot be a principal for any agent.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>DISTRIBUTION<br/>
OF RIGHTS UPON DISSOLUTION OF UA: </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>An association may be wounded up<br/>
in a formal manner, but in the absence of formal dissolution the question<br/>
arises as to the circumstances which will justify a finding that the UA has<br/>
ceased to exist. In <i>Re G.K.N. Bolts and<br/>
Nuts Ltd</i>, it was held that ‘mere inactivity is not sufficient, unless it is<br/>
so prolonged or so circumstanced that the only reasonable interference is<br/>
spontaneous dissolution in which case the court must select a date’.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Where the association’s purposes<br/>
were charitable and the rights were held by its officers/members on trust for<br/>
charitable purposes, any remaining funds will be applied <i>cy-près</i> (an old French legal term meaning, approximately ‘as near<br/>
as possible’) the same purpose – (<i>Re<br/>
Vernan</i>, <i>Re Finger</i>). This means,<br/>
the surplus funds will be applied to a different but similar purpose.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>However, where the rights were<br/>
held on trust for valid non-charitable purposes, different rules apply. If the<br/>
rules of the association make provision regarding the distribution of rights on<br/>
dissolution, those rules will be decisive, and the court will merely give<br/>
effect to such rules. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>But, in the event where the rules<br/>
are silent as to the destination of the surplus funds on dissolution,<br/>
traditionally surplus funds were held on resulting trust for members in<br/>
proportion to their contribution – (<i>Re<br/>
Printers</i>, <i>Re Hobourn</i>); on the<br/>
basis that, the funds were held on purpose trust, regarding the purpose as the<br/>
purpose of the association, which then fails because of the dissolution. But<br/>
this is wrong, as the winding up of the association will not in itself be a<br/>
winding up of the purpose.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>An alternative approach was seen<br/>
in <i>Cunnack v Edwards</i>, where a surplus<br/>
remained in a friendly society’s funds after the death of the last widow<br/>
annuitant. The CA held that the members had contributed on the basis of<br/>
contract, i.e. each payment was made in consideration for the payment of an<br/>
annuity to the subscriber’s widow. Each member had therefore enjoyed their full<br/>
contractual entitlement from the fund. Thus, the surplus went <i>bona vacantia</i> to the Crown.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>However, donors donate to the<br/>
purpose trust thereby contracting with the trustees to obtain a particular<br/>
personal benefit out of the purpose – makes a nonsense of the idea that the<br/>
money is held genuinely on purpose trust. <i>Cunnack<br/>
v Edwards</i> is an anomalous case, and it is difficult to put any reasonable<br/>
construction on it.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>This approach was also used in <i>Re West Sussex</i>, to deal with parts of<br/>
the surplus remaining on the dissolution of a police benevolent fund. Goff J<br/>
held that, members’ contributions, together with funds raised by way of<br/>
entertainments and raffles, had all been given on a contractual basis, and<br/>
should therefore go <i>bona vacantia</i> to<br/>
the Crown. The part which represented the contributions of identifiable donors,<br/>
however, was held for such donors on a resulting trust.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>It is difficult to see why third<br/>
party contributors, even if identifiable, should have any claim in such<br/>
circumstances. The validity of the initial gift is usually explained on the<br/>
basis that, it is an absolute gift to the members of the association. If that<br/>
is so, such contributions should be dealt with on the same basis as the rest of<br/>
the funds. Thus, it is submitted that there is no room for a resulting trust<br/>
for third parties.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>The more acceptable modern<br/>
solution to this issue is the one advocated in <i>Re Bucks</i>, which applied the modern contract-holding theory and held<br/>
that – on dissolution, the funds were held by the members of the association<br/>
outright.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;Times New Roman"",""serif""'>Under either version of the<br/>
contract-holding theory, the surplus funds will simply be distributed among the<br/>
membership existing at the time of the dissolution. Because, under the<br/>
contract-holding theory the members of the association hold the rights<br/>
outright. When the association dissolves, their contractual obligation to use<br/>
the rights in a particular way simply disappears, so they can distribute the<br/>
rights to themselves in equal shares, or do anything else with them they want,<br/>
so long as they do it consensually according to the rules of the association.<span id=""pastemarkerend""> </span></p>

<div class=""entry-content"">
<p>Critically consider liberal accounts of the ‘underclass’. To what extent is a focus on cultural characteristics useful in aiding our understanding of social exclusion.</p>
<p>Use of the term social exclusion arose in Europe in the wake of prolonged and large scale unemployment that provoked criticisms of welfare systems for failing to prevent poverty and for hindering economic development. Silver (1994) stresses that economic restructuring in North American and European countries since the mid-</p>
<p>1970s has given rise to such terms as <em>social exclusion, new poverty, </em>and <em>the underclass </em>to describe the consequent negative effects on the more vulnerable populationsin these countries. Such phenomena also intensified the debate over the adequacy ofuniversal social protection policies and fuelled growing concern about the distributivefairness of employment and income patterns. Used first in France (Yepez-del-Castillo 1994), the concept spread quickly to the United Kingdom and throughoutthe European Union. Social exclusion theorists are concerned with the dissolution of social bonds, theincomplete extension of social rights and protections to all groups, and the linksbetween the idea of exclusion and more conventional understandings of inequality.They draw on theories of poverty, inequality, and disadvantage. In this context policiesto aid the excluded have focused on subsidizing jobs and wages, providing housing, and responding to urbanization. The value added of these discussions derivesfrom their focus on the multifaceted nature of deprivation and on analysis of themechanisms and institutions that function to exclude people (de Haan 1998). Theconcept of social exclusion has encouraged scholars to consider simultaneously theeconomic, social, and political dimensions of deprivation. As Bhalla and Lapeyre(1997) stress, this concept encompasses the notion of poverty broadly defined, butis more general in that it explicitly emphasizes poverty’s relational as well as its distributionalaspects.</p>
<p>Social Exclusion is another term for the lower strata poor. This implies that this is more than just about the straight poor but instead about behaviour which has created a lifestyle which is permanently dislocated from the habits and way of life of the majority. The concept of the underclass has been widely contested today. It has many links with social exclusion, the notion of a cycle of deprivation and cultural theories. During the course of this essay a number of different areas will be looked at. The focal point of this essay will rest by and large in the culture of binge drinking which is apparent across a significant area of the population. This part of the population has been named in many different ways by the media and social theorists alike from Chavs to the deprived to the socially excluded, all of which lead us to the same concept ‘The Underclass’. It will then discuss different perspectives on the ‘underclass’ both into whether it truly exists and whether it is the individuals or the welfare states fault. This essay will interrogate Murray’s claims about the ‘underclass’ and explain how he is right on a descriptive level but totally wrong on an explanatory level. Furthermore it will look at media accounts of the urban poor and the fact that they are overwhelmingly liberal in orientation. Lastly it will look at the rise of neo-liberalism and the effect it has had on the poor in Britain.</p>
<p>There have been many theorists which have researched the concept of the ‘underclass’ one of which who is highly recognised across Britain and the US is Charles Murray. Murray came to the UK in 1989 in search of an underclass and wrote an article in The Sunday Times about there being the foundations of an ‘underclass’ in British Society, this was widely contested amongst British sociologists and rejected. However this concept has now been widely researched and there has been increasing truth to Murray’s (1990) article ‘The Emerging British Underclass’. This article wrote in quite general terms about the ‘underclass’ and related it to trends of illegitimacy, crime and unemployment. His second essay written in 1996 ‘Underclass: The crisis deepens’ was preoccupied with illegitimacy, marriage and the state of the British Family. The concept of a traditional nuclear family reducing the chances of a child turning to crime has been one which has been researched heavily. Although no conclusion has been reached it is still widely believed to be true. The term ‘underclass’ was derived by Ken Auletta in the 1980’s to emphasise the behaviour and values of those deemed to be lower class. Murray (1996) attempts in great detail to show that he does not apply the term ‘underclass’ to all poor , only to those;</p>
<p>‘<em>distinguished by there undesirable behaviour, including drug taking, illegitimacy, failure to hold down a job, truancy from school and casual violence,’.</em></p>
<p>Murray believes illegitimacy is the best indicator of an underclass in the making and the rising trend in illegitimacy therefore alarms him. He places a special focus on issues of violence as it becomes increasingly difficult to raise children to be un-aggressive when whole towns fall prey to criminality. However Alan walker offers a liberal view. He believes that Murray ‘blames the victim’ and thus diverts our attention from blaming the mechanisms through which resources are distributed. Victim blaming is the attitude which walker believes to have been at the root of many measures from Elizabethan Poor Law to today’s ‘YTS’ and ‘restart’ programmes. There is the belief by Murray that there are two types of poor people, one of whom live on low incomes and another who don’t just lack money .</p>
<p><em>‘There homes were littered and un-kept. The men in the family were unable to hold a job for more than a few weeks at a time. Drunkenness was common. The children grew up ill schooled and contributed a disproportionate share of the local juvenile delinquents.’</em></p>
<p>There are many other arguments about the underclass. Robert Moore suggested that despite his own misgivings;</p>
<p><em>‘a collective term such as the ‘underclass’ may be needed to refer to that group of marginalised migrant workers, refugees and asylum seekers, inner city ethnic minority populations and the very poorest who typically have little or no control over goods and skills either within or outside a given economic order’.</em></p>
<p>This coincides with Ralf Darendorf’s view that the term ‘underclass’ is a ‘phenomenon of race’ here as well as the US. These are all rather liberal accounts of the underclasses and a view is taken that the majority of underclasses in both the UK and the US are ethnic minorities many of which are first r secong generation immigrants who have little or no understanding of the British Culture. Many of these minorities will live in poorer areas in which there children will fall victim to the culture of the ‘underclass.’ This culture includes getting involved with gangs, binge drinking and often leads to unprotected sex which would continue the cycle of the ‘underclass’.</p>
<p>The liberal accounts of the ‘underclass’ tend to focus on the pathological individual. This is that if they are poor and don’t have a job it is there fault. Part of the pathological explanation suggests that it is the behaviour and attitudes of the underclass that have cut them off from normal society – Murray being a strong advocate of this view, argues that welfare dependency has created a counter-cultural attitude that there is no need to work if one can instead receive state benefits or turn to crime instead. The opposing position suggests that the lack of full employment in the economy results in the unemployed and hence poverty. Here it is the failure of the structure rather than the individual themselves who can be blamed for the emergence of an underclass.</p>
<p>Auletta refers to the underclass as a group who do not “assimilate” (1982: xvi quoted in Morris, 1994: 81), identifying four main groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>the passive poor, usually long term welfare recipients</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>the hostile street criminal, drop-outs and drug addicts</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>the hustlers, dependent on the underground economy but rarely involved in violent crime</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>the traumatised drunks, drifters, homeless bag ladies and released mental patients</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In identifying these groups it can be seen that perhaps a different explanation for the underclass can be given for each grouping. However, in all four cases it could be argued that the underlying reason for the exclusion from society could be either pathological or structural. For example it could be argued that the ‘passive poor’ are so because they hold the attitude that there is no need for work. The same group could also be said to exist because there are not enough jobs available in the economy for them to work.</p>
<p>‘The underclass’ as a phrase has shifted in emphasis since the 80’s and this shift is partly in response to liberal commentators who suggested that the poor of the contemporary period are idle, jobless and criminal. ‘The underclass’ as a phrase became associated with blaming the poor for their marginalised social situation. Murray’s claims are partly right at the descriptive level, but totally wrong at the explanatory level. There are many different reasons which could offer a far more reasonable explanation on the concentration of urban marginality today. Firstly the changing economy provides us with a number of reasons into why there is an underclass in the UK. Liberals and conservatives today tend to stress values like individual responsibility when considering such issues such as drugs, violence, teen pregnancy, family formation and the work ethic. Some critics readily blame welfare for poverty and find it hard to see how anybody even the poor would deliberately deviate from mainstream culture. With widespread joblessness many inner city people become stressed and there communities become distressed, poor people adapt to these circumstances as best they know, meeting the exigencies of there situation as best they can. The kinds of problems which cause moral outrage begin to emerge; teen pregnancy, welfare dependency and the underground economy. Its cottage industries of drugs, prostitution, welfare scams and other rackets pick up the economic slack. It is this underground economy which provides a means for these people as the regular economy cannot.</p>
<p>Since 1997, the New Labour government has developed and administered contemporary social policy around the ideals of social inclusion. The Social Exclusion Unit (SEU), Welfare to Work and New Deal Programmes (1998) provide the chief manifestations of socially-inclusive policy. The SEU describes social exclusion as the ‘short hand for what can happen when people or areas are suffering from a combination of linked problems such as unemployment, poor skills, low incomes, poor housing, high crime, bad health and family breakdown’ (SEU, 2001: 10). The shift to social inclusion policy is a response to the need to prevent individuals at risk of exclusion from becoming excluded, according to the SEU: a need it proposes to address by, for example, resolving to reverse the growth in family breakups, teenage pregnancies and crime, and to reduce possible restrictions to an individual’s ‘economic opportunity’. And, where necessary, policy should be designed with the aim of reintegrating those already excluded socially, through programmes such as the New Deal and Welfare to Work (ibid: 29). Bauman argues that the shift in social policy towards the language of social inclusion is a result of key economic trends in the West, leading to the growth of a population that has become surplus to labour-market requirements. Byrne argues that social-inclusion rhetoric is the surface-froth of the more fundamental shift to Post-Fordist patterns of capital accumulation, where those at the margins of inclusion and exclusion serve as part of the reconstitution of a reserve army of labour power.</p>
<p>Clearly, Bauman and Byrne differ in their explanations: Bauman viewing the ‘excluded’ as an unwanted surplus to the expansion of capital, and Byrne viewing the excluded as vital to capitalist expansion. For Bauman, contemporary changes in social policy are part of the wider shift of the welfare state away from policy directed at supporting the re-commodification of labour power. Capital accumulation up until the 1985 required the state to play its role in the provision of key resources, including housing, education, health and, when necessary, welfare payments to the unemployed. This, for Bauman, ensured the re-commodification of quality labour power and also secured a viable reserve army; both of which were essential for post-war capitalist expansion. Since the 1980’s, argues Bauman, capital accumulation has become increasingly premised on the rationalisation of the use of labour power, and thus on the shedding of the labour force. As a consequence, the role of the welfare state has changed, moving towards means-tested and targeted benefits, and towards-via training and employment policies-catering for capitalism’s need for insecure, low-quality labour power, and the disciplining of a growing surplus population. As Bauman observes,</p>
<p><em>‘The present-day stream-lined, downsized, capital-and knowledge-intensive industry casts labour as a constraint on the rise of productivity to such a degree that economic growth and the rise of employment are, for all practical intents, at cross-purposes; technological progress is measured by the replacement and elimination of labour’ (Bauman, 1998: 65).</em></p>
<p>The shift in welfare-state priorities towards social inclusion signifies deeper changes in the re-commodification of labour power. In this context, the issue of social exclusion and the rhetoric of social-inclusion policy signifies the emergence of a surplus population which is no longer required by capital as a reserve army of labour. To be sure, a reserve army of labour still exists in non-Western, industrialised areas of the world. For the West, though, capital no longer requires a welfare state committed to the universal provision of key services and social needs, because the maintenance of a reserve army is no longer functional to capital accumulation. For Bauman;</p>
<p><em>‘The welfare state will become increasingly residual as social policy confines itself to organising the control and administration of a population increasingly isolated from the capitalist labour market. Government is haunted by the prospect of the homeless and disinherited flocking in and capital flocking out’. (Bauman, 1998: 54)</em></p>
<p>This, for Bauman, is the reason why social exclusion and social-inclusion policy predominates discourses on welfare.</p>
<p>Bauman’s argument provides a useful explanation of the shift in social policy towards social inclusion. However, the hard-and-fast equating of social exclusion with a surplus labour force playing no role as a reserve army is both empirically and theoretically suspect. Bauman ignores the day-to-day realities of the capitalist system in the West, where the links between capital’s demand for labour power and a surplus of unemployed remain of crucial importance. For Bauman’s proposition to hold, one must assume that those experiencing social exclusion have no connection with the labour market and the status of wage labour. Yet evidence does not support such a view. Evidence suggests</p>
<p><em>‘A degree of complexity, with people variously experiencing exclusion with no labour-market attachment, exclusion with some labour-market attachment, and inclusion with weak and/or strong labour-market attachments (Labour Market Trends: 2002).</em></p>
<p>In other words the experience of exclusion is as likely to be one premised on the poor, unstable employment as it is as on unemployment and ‘unemployability’ (Levitas, 1999). Evidence, suggests that labour power continues to function as a reserve army of labour, however attenuated this function might be. A more realistic proposition for Bauman to make might be that the surplus population is growing at a faster rate relative to its function as a reserve army of labour. In this case, those experiencing this situation have little choice, within the constraints of contemporary capitalism, but to remain unemployed and consequently, as Dinerstein suggests;</p>
<p><em>‘suffer the humiliation of having to beg for work and be in a permanent state of readiness to offer their labour power as a commodity’. (Dinerstein, 2002)</em></p>
<p>Media accounts of the urban poor are overwhelmingly ‘liberal’ in orientation. Many of which, are talking about dole cheats and young women getting pregnant for council houses. The Suns ‘shop a dole cheat’ campaign hails from the same intellectual tradition as Murray. Many media campaigns have victimised the poor and paved the way for the ‘Chav’ culture. This has been ridiculed and reported on in the press and on television. A number of attacks have been launched on television channels and there treatment of Britain’s working classes. It was seen to be not only patronising and offensive but also potentially dangerous. Reality television shows such as Wife Swap, Big Brother and the confessional Jeremy Kyle Show, which tend to rely on working-class participants in search of fame or fortune, were the focus of most criticism. But the portrayal of the working classes in comedy programmes such as Little Britain and dramas like Shameless were also debated.</p>
<p>Ethnic minority groups are ‘excluded’ as a result of their position in the new economy. In this sense, marginalised whites have a lot in common with marginalised blacks. There is however the associated dynamic of discrimination- the most notable example is the place of Muslims in a post 9/11 western world- however, understanding the position of these groups is more about ‘moral panics’ and fear of otherness. The economic literature on discrimination tends to focus on the different treatment of individuals-based on race, gender, or ethnicity in labour, credit, and consumer goods markets. This is obviously a serious matter, and there is ample evidence in the United States and elsewhere that such disparities are real and quantitatively important as a source of inter group economic inequalities (Modood and others 1997; Wilson 1996). Nevertheless, when considering ethnic group inequality, economists should look beyond what happens in markets. Of course, economists tend to focus on how markets work or fail. Economic theory suggests that discrimination based on gender or racial identity should be arbitraged away in markets of competitive sellers, employers, and lenders. But such discrimination is readily observed in society, and this anomaly attracts attention. Critics of neoclassical economics seize on it, and defenders of that orthodoxy seek to explain it away. Thus evidence that wage differences between the races or sexes have declined, after controlling for worker productivity, is supposed to vindicate the economist’s belief in market forces. This way of approaching the problem is too narrow. With wages, for example, the usual focus is on the demand side of the labour market-employers either have a “taste” for discrimination or use race as a proxy for unobserved variables that imply lower productivity for minorities. The primary normative claim in this approach is that such discrimination is morally offensive, a legitimate object of regulatory intervention, and a significant contributor to racial and gender inequality. But implicit in this claim is the notion that if inequality were due to supply-side differences-in the Glenn C. Loury <em>233</em> skills presented to employers by blacks and whites, for example-the resulting disparity would not raise the same moral issues or give a comparable warrant for intervention. There is a comparable view in housing markets-that residential segregation induced by the discriminatory behaviour of realtors is a bigger problem than segregation that comes about because of the freely made decisions of market participants. I propose a shift in emphasis. In the United States market discrimination against blacks still exists, but such discrimination is not as significant an explanation for racial inequality as in decades past. This calls into question the conventional wisdom on equal opportunity policy-that eliminating racial discrimination in markets will eventually resolve racial economic inequality. Much evidence supports the view that the substantial gap in skills between blacks and whites is a key factor accounting for racial inequality in the labour market. Yet this skills gap is itself the result of social exclusion processes that deserve explicit study and policy remediation.</p>
<p><em>‘The gap reflects social and cultural factors-geographic segregation, deleterious social norms and peer influences, poor education- that have a racial dimension’ (Cutler and Glaeser 1997; Akerlof 1997)</em></p>
<p>Group inequality such as that between blacks and whites in the United States cannot be fully understood, or remedied, with a focus on market discrimination alone.</p>
<p>Liberals like Murray look at cultural characteristics of the poor as a means of explaining ‘social exclusion’. They say the poor is poor because they are lazy, because they don’t try at school, because they don’t get married. In my opinion the real reason the poor are poor is because; There aren’t any meaningful jobs anymore for these social groups. The economy no longer needs everyone to work. The successive governments have allowed our welfare state to slowly degenerate. Mainstream society have been conned into believing that these people bring it on themselves.</p>
<p>Charles Murray in 1989 used drop out from the labour force among young males, violent crime and births from unmarried women would all be associated with the growth of a class of violent unsocialised people who if they become sufficiently numerous will fundamentally degrade the life of society. This can be seen to be happening today with the creation of ‘chav culture’. These ‘Chavs’ are usually working class and live on council estates and dress in sportswear hoodies, tracksuits and caps. They wear excessive gold jewellery and are seen to be aggressive and uneducated. There was a dramatic increase in unemployed males between 1989 and 1999 from 20.5% to 31.2% which has continued to till today. Drop out in the labour force was largest in the group who had the least excuses to work these were from ages 20 to 24. The economy was not to be blamed fully as overall national employment was lower in 1999 than in 1989. The percentage of men in school did not change appreciatiably and increases of people in higher education have been concentrated among young women and people of both sexes over the age of 30. Since 1994 the number of men in higher education has actually decrease and crime both violent and property are higher than of that in America since 1996.</p>
<p>From the mid 19<sup>th</sup> century to the first ¾ of this century Britain enjoyed being seen as the most civilised country on earth. The US in this same period was seen as a violent and unruly society with high levels of personal freedom but lower levels of civility. Other continents had low crime rates but a high level of authoritarian control, however Britain is now another high crime industrialised country. Violent crime is seen as impulsive behaviour by those who seek instant gratification of there desires which is part of a general lack of socialisation and is the hallmark of the ‘underclass’. Over the last two decades British children have not been socialised to norms of self control, consideration of others, and the concept that actions have consequences. Murray states;</p>
<p><em>‘One of the leading reasons that they are not being socialised is that larger numbers of British children are not being raised by two mature married adults’.</em></p>
<p>He believes that there is not alternative form of family which comes close to the traditional nuclear family of two married parents. He believed that children of two married biological parents were found to do much better than the children of single parents and the children of divorced mothers were found to do better than the children of never married mothers. Illegitimacy is overwhelmingly a lower class phenomenon. However Melanie Phillips argues that it is in fact the overclass’ fault that we have a lower strata poor.</p>
<p>Children from deprived areas sometimes don’t know how to use a knife and fork; they don’t know what an alarm clock is; because they have no sense of an ordered day. Primary school children who have no idea how to make social relationships but who are aggressive foul mouthed or withdrawn. The government has ambitious plans and programmes on how to tackle social exclusion, turning out papers on truancy, teenage pregnancies, repairing shattered communities. All of which are commendable however this all presents the socially excluded as a breed apart, as an underclass and if there behaviour is somehow different from the rest of society. Government advisors and officials and advisors talk about drugs for instance and they assume that the higher strata can handle cannibas and cocaine but the poor cannot. On education they say there is nothing wrong with the top 2% of schools the problems are with separate sink schools with high levels of truancy and low levels of basic literacy. On family they say ‘I’m cohabit, I’m a lone parent’ so there is nothing wrong with the changing family. It’s the poor who are the problem. This is not only hypocritical and unpleasant but it fails to see how culture works: that signals matter, that they work top down and that what is supportive behaviour by the upper classes can have a disastrous impact on the poor who do not have the soft cushioning of money and privilege to fall back on. The culture of being a lone parent is in some ways created by the elites who lead by example through judges who generally give custody to women and demand monthly child support paid to single mothers who are now also receiving extra benefits and this is done through an increase in taxes on married couples. Surely reducing the males role to nothing but a walking wallet and sperm donor is causing men who are poor to run away from marriage.</p>
<p>To understand the underclass is imperative in understanding poverty as a whole. But perhaps more important is the understanding that the underclass is simply a collective term used to refer to a group of <em>individuals</em>. By grouping these individuals together it is far too easy to make stereotypical judgements and statements which, whilst certainly applying to various members of the group, by no means hold true for each individual within. Indeed, it is with little doubt that many members of the underclass do cut themselves off from society due to their behaviours and attitudes, but there will be many who do not. Some people are born more disadvantaged than others – take the disabled and elderly for example. Both of these groups can fall within a definition of the underclass – they are often dependent upon the state and are in many ways excluded from certain aspects of society. It would take a radical commentator to suggest that either of these groups, and hence the whole of the underclass, are so due to their behaviour and attitudes.</p>

<b>Unfailing Service is The Key to Successful Operation of Hotels</b><br/>
<b>Introduction</b><br/>
A hotel’s mission statement should include some exceptional and memorable services it provides for the customers than its competitors do. It should include some different service characteristics. The hotel managers must make sure that the exceptional and memorable services are executed well so that these services do not fail. To provide unfailing services continuously, training and maintenance of its employees on a regular basis must be undertaken.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The complex range of intellectual, personal, and interpersonal skills required to deliver quality customer service. A service provider can apply such sophisticated skills only after undertaking foundation training in their organization’s product and services.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hospitality managers are required to select and train employees in these areas, to develop and modify systems and processes to support service delivery and to motivate employees to meet customer expectations. As role models, managers show service employees how to manage the service encounter, how to apply judgment and how to solve problems. The difficulty, of course, is that customers frequently do not know exactly what they want. Even when they have received what they regard as superior service, they are often unable to articulate, why it was superior.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Literature Review</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Hotel – the Service Industry</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hotel services are not ‘pure’ services but a combination of ‘service’ and ‘product’. Example: Restaurant meal – tangible product; Waiter service is intangible service.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hotel as service industry can’t do it in isolation. It needs support of other services. These components are:</p>
<ol start=""1"" style=""text-align: justify;"" type=""1"">
<li><b>The Service Component:</b> provision of accommodation, food, drink and space in which to relax or conduct business.</li>
<li><b>The Supply component:</b> is the provision of meals and drinks through hotels food service department. The supply of information from the front office or concierge.</li>
<li><b>The Manufacturing component:</b> involves physical transformation of raw materials into goods such as meals and dirty bedroom into clean ones, etc.</li>
<li><b>Transportation component:</b> the conveyance of guests to and from any place. No hotels can survive without transportation. Tow types: surface (on land and sea) and air.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">These four groupings each has different operational characteristics and hence require different approaches for their effective management.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Distinction between ‘Tangibles’ and ‘Intangibles’</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Tangible products can be directly experienced, seen, touched, smelt, tasted and tested, probably in advance of purchase.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Intangible products on the other hand can’t be tried out in advance. Most tangible products have some intangible elements some features can’t be seen or tasted in advance.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The concept of tangibles and intangibles can further be explained through the molecular model of hotel operation:</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· <b>Tangible elements: </b>Admin &amp; Clerical, Room facilities, Room décor, Restaurant facilities.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· <b>Intangible elements: </b>Reception service, Night sleep, Room ambience, F&amp;B service, Restaurant ambience, etc.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The molecular model relates well to the nature of the hotel product since it too comprises a collection of separate but interrelated elements such as the room facilities, the room decor, the food in the restaurant, the service received from the staff, the overall ambience of the establishments and so on, built around the intangible core of a night’s stay away from home. One conclusion from the molecular approach is that intangible-dominant enterprises should stress the tangible features of their operation to counteract the abstract nature of the intangible features. In this way it is suggested that hotels should pay particular attention to the people who work in contact with the guest, he decor of the establishment, the correspondence with the guest, and any other tangible evidence for that particular attention.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Hotel – The Service Characteristics</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• <b>Services are Perishable:</b> a hotel room which is unsold on one day can not be sold until the next day. The fixed cost increases such as cleaning, mopping, electricity, welcome basket, etc.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• <b>Services are Intangible:</b> services depend upon culture of the hotel, personality of the hotel staff, the image of the hotel, etc.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• <b>Services are Heterogeneous:</b> service given to one customer may differ from service given to customer in another room. Because one customer is attending a conference, the other is in honeymoon or relaxing.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• <b>Services are Contact Dependent:</b> Unlike manufacturing where the producer and the customer may never come into contact, it is impossible for a customer to experience a hotel service without physically being present.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• <b>Services can not be Owned:</b> Unlike manufacturing products, hotel services can’t be owned for ever. Because customers hire the hotel services and products for the time they stay in the hotel.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The front office in a hotel is called the heart of operation. In fact, the only direct contact most guests have with hotel employees, other than in the restaurants, is with members of the front-office staff. The hotel front office system takes care of customer accounts and the day to day running of the hotel as well as the Reservations. They all need to not only hear, but listen with better intensity. Front office managers must remember that the front desk is the communication center of every hotel. The front office manager must monitor both guest and staff interaction to insure proper guest service and protocol.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The most obvious requirement for any successful front office manager or sales professional is to know all the details about your product and services. Most interaction a hotel guest makes is with the front office. That’s why if any problem faced by the guest, they call front office whether it could be function of other department. All the pressure goes to front office but they welcome these with smiling. They maintain good language, positive attitude, and instant knowledge.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The concierge of the hotel front office department creates lasting impression to the guests. Their job description is to move heaven and earth to delight every guest all the time. As they provide the first and last impression to the guests. Any other service that is not covered by other department is covered by the concierge. They should approach every customer with the same concierge mindset…”I will do whatever it takes to provide the best service you have ever received”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>The Topic</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Unfailing Services: Exceptional and Memorable</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Before starting to write about these, let’s see following case:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Mr. Karim had just dashed out of the ABC Hotel in a hurry, late for his next appointment. He started to open the car door only to realize he misplaced the keys. He retraced his steps, frantically searching the parking lot and purse and briefcase compartments. Mr. Asad, the hotel’s area sales director, noticed Mr. Karim’s distress and immediately commanded the front desk agents, bellmen, housekeepers, the bus driver, the security guard and various administrators lingering outside to help in the search. Much to Mr. Karim’s amazement, the whole team enthusiastically jumped in and dedicated their efforts to locating the keys. With no luck and recognizing his dilemma to get to his next meeting, Mr. Asad offered to drive him. When he dropped him off, Mr. Asad offered to pick him up again and drive him back to his office where he could arrange for a spare key.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">That was exceptional service.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Through leadership and a commitment to service excellence, Mr. Asad surpassed all expectations, motivated his staff to do the same and turned a potentially negative experience into a memorable and positive one.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>When ordinary individuals do extraordinary things to actually serve a customer or guest, that’s exceptional service. </i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In a world where good service seems to be the exception rather than the rule, why are excellent examples so rare? Why are front-line personnel so seemingly ill equipped to provide the kind of service that makes a difference? Is service, especially exceptional service, a lost art?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This question of service, even at satisfactory levels, is not new and has actually been building to a crescendo. While building new hotels, cruise lines, restaurants and attractions continues at a frenzied pace, guests are demanding more than new lobbies and exquisite cuisine. Travelers search for ways to make their lives easier and their moments more memorable. Guests want their needs anticipated and their expectations surpassed.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The competition for experiences that count is higher than ever. In areas, where tourism ranks as one of the area’s leading industries, there are constant mixed reports on the quality of service. And while examples of good service like Mr. Asad’s exist, the challenge of consistently finding, delivering and experiencing exceptional service seems greater than ever.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The intriguing opportunity is that exceptional service leads to Takas. But these Takas are being lost through lack of guest experience management. There is no question – service sells. Repeat business, referrals and extended stays depend on guests having a comprehensively positive experience. And while technology has created more avenues to reach customers and guests, it can turn guests off and cause unanticipated disappointments without a live body to respond to their needs. Guests are craving the personal touch more than ever – and they will pay for it.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The magic to it is the exceptional service formula and is directly traced to guest experience management. The prepackaged moment is not enough. From the moment a guest steps off the plane or drives up in a car, the experience “clock” is ticking. Guest experience management takes charge of this process. This proactive strategy distinguishes “experiences” from “services” and promotes them as a new economic offering. For example, services are delivered; experiences are staged. Services are intangible; experiences are memorable. Services are customized; experiences are personal. Services are delivered on demand; experiences are revealed over a period of time. Services address benefits; experiences address sensations. Whether the experience begins by phone, at the airport, the car rental counter, the taxi to the hotel or the entrance of the hotel, the restaurant, the cruise or the attraction, an impression and memory are in process. Each of these impression touch points build on each other and are huge opportunities to provide exceptional service – and greater profits.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If the doorman, the bellman, the front desk clerk, the pool attendant, the room service representative, the housekeeper, the concierge and the general manager proactively participate in creating engaging and exceptional encounters, guests will sign up for more and will tell others about their wonderful experience and the excellent service. This was certainly the case with the entire staff at the ABC Hotel.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Employees often feel constrained by their job titles. Doormen should mainly open doors, massage therapists should mainly give massage treatments, and room attendants should mainly clean rooms. This type of constraint can inhibit the potential creativity and zeal that employees experience in their jobs. The manager’s job is to ensure that every employee knows that their primary job is to serve customers. Each employee should know this from the very beginning during the recruitment and interview processes.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Each employee needs to do consistently: </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Never should say “no”. Always should give options and alternatives.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Going above and beyond will be the minimum standard of performance for all customers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Feel empowered to create exceptional memories. This assumes that the leader trusts his subordinate enough to empower him, coach (not chastise) the efforts and give encouragement regularly.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Coordinate and work with other departments to surprise and delight customers. It is difficult to go above and beyond by yourself.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Always follow through on customer requests.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This may be time for each of us to reconsider how to take service to a higher level. Hotel leaders should encourage their employees to take on new areas of responsibility in creating guest experiences and provide appropriate training to do so. In hospitality, greatness should never be taken for granted and hotels must always strive for constant, consistent and persistent service to maintain and enhance reputations they have earned.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In the hospitality business, leaders who care about their employees will inspire them to take risks with new ideas, empower them to do more and create opportunities to make more memorable moments for each guest. Employers who care more about employees will see those same employees care more about guests. Guests who are cared for, especially in uncertain times, will become more loyal and in turn, feel reassured to spend more, want to repeat their experience and will refer others. Everyone feels comfortable at “home” and when the same spirit of welcome is created for guests, they become more comfortable and are able to more fully enjoy a leisure or business hospitality experience away from home.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hoteliers should have the courage to take the next steps in service delivery and instill curiosity, hard work, honesty, loyalty and commitment in their employees. With a strong mission statement which unifies all managers and employees in a shared purpose, service excellence standards can be defined. With a solid framework for exceptional service delivery, these values and standards will become stronger than ever and guest experiences will benefit from a new generation of service excellence.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Consider ways to enhance the personal touch at each point of contact and really think about the ways guests may be able to connect more with your environment.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Customer Choice Analysis</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In order to understand why customers choose one product over another, it is necessary for managers to have some understanding of the consumer decision making process. There are numerous extrinsic (external) and intrinsic (internal) factors this influence this process as shown in the following figure. Intrinsic factors include physical, emotional, and other needs that may be met by the hospitality experience. Extrinsic factors, such as a consumer’s cultural background, also pay a role in decision making, particularly in choice of food.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As figure shows, once a customer perceives a need (in this case, hunger), this translates into action, when a review of options is undertaken. This could involve a search of restaurants on the internet or a stroll down the street, looking at menus. Family or group members may influence the decision and the purchaser may have minimal involvement in the decision making process. Once a decision has been made and the meal is eaten, the group makes an evaluation of the quality and the value of the meal consumed. This covers the whole experience, such as the wait time for service, the noise from other patrons, the music and the lighting, even when these factors are not consciously considered.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Service Quality</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In certain cases, it can be difficult for a customer to ascertain the exact nature of the outcome of a service. Because services are an essential part of the tourism experience, service quality is thus a crucial aspect of satisfying tourists. Usually, there are ten dimensions of service quality in hotel operation:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Tangibles:</b> The appearance of physical artifacts and staff members connected with the service (accommodation, equipment, staff uniforms, and so on.)</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Reliability:</b> Ability to deliver the promised service.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Responsiveness:</b> Readiness of staff members to help in a pleasant and effective way.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Competence:</b> Capability of staff member in executing the service.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Courtesy:</b> The respect, thoughtfulness, and politeness exhibited by staff members who are in contact with the customer.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Credibility:</b> Trustworthiness and honesty of the service provider.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Security:</b> Absence of doubt, economic risk, and physical danger.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Access:</b> Accessibility of the service provider.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Communication:</b> Understandable manner and use of language by the service provider.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Understanding the Customer:</b> Efforts by the service provider to know and understand the customer.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Service Attributes</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There are some services attributes to which the hotel managers must pay special attention to maintain well. The following figure shows these attributes.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Customer Service Issues</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The types of customer service issues that may emerge in the hospitality environment are many and varied, and some that management and staff are sure to encounter are shown below.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Response Time</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Response times vary considerably. In the restaurant setting, the customer who have just arrived wants immediate attention, while the customer waiting for the dessert menu is seldom is such a hurry (unless planning to go to the theatre or a movie). It is the manager’s responsibility to ensure that all staff do their best to understand, and cater for, all customers’ need.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Service</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Customer expectations regarding the level of service provided should be clarified by management in all promotional literature. At the budget level, minimum services are provided, linen is not changed daily and cleaning is minimal or perhaps excluded during a guest’s stay. Indeed, in a backpacker lodge, there may be a lockout period for cleaning and maintenance, during which all guests are expected to leave the premises. At the other end of the market, a guest can expect linen to be changed daily, a turndown and a chocolate on the pillow. Such premises would be kept in ‘as new’ condition at all time.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Pricing</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Pricing is an extremely tricky issue for hotels. For example, a yield management approach can result in different prices for the same product. Like the airlines, hotels discount their rooms to large groups and to guests who book well in advance. This practice is aimed at increasing occupancy and yield (profitability). Only a small percentage of customers may be paying the full rack rate, while the majority of customers are on corporate or other discounted packages. If rooms are discounted for large tour groups and a hotel is consequently fully booked, potential revenue is lost if guests who are prepared to pay the full rack rate have to be turned away.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Product Quality</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In the hospitality industry, product includes meals, beds, furnishings, business centers, gymnasiums, swimming pools and the like. Quality expectations of the product offered are generally linked to price. Food products, for example, can differ markedly. Some restaurants offer menu items that are prepared from only the freshest and finest ingredients, which result in exquisite product at a high price. Other restaurants use packaged, frozen and bulk foods in their products, which sell for a lower price. A customer may choose the products and price ranges of both types of restaurants at different times. In the accommodation sector, too, there are circumstances where the one customer is looking for a low budget solution when travelling privately, and is happy with minimal furnishings, but when travelling on business or booking a conference, their expectation of room quality is quite different.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Presentation Standards</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Presentation standards also vary according to price. Clients would expect to pay the highest price for the formal banquet, for example, while a catered function at home would be far less sophisticated and far less costly. Personal presentation standards also relate to the type of being staged.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Complaint Management</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">One of the most important issues for customers is complaint management. Indeed, it is preferable to call it ‘problem-solving’, since the issue is frequently unrelated to the product or service provided directly by the hospitality establishment but to a range of associated circumstances. For example, a customer may arrive from the airport at 10 am not realizing that their room will not be available for check-in until 2 pm. Storing the guest’s baggage in the interim or encouraging guests to use the swimming pool area and change room to shower and relax while waiting for expeditious room cleaning can solve such a problem.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Successful hotel operation depends almost about its services. Sometimes an effective service can achieve a guest’s mind even they are unsatisfied with some of the products the hotel provides. It is all about the employees’ capability to handle the guests whatever happens being apologized, polite, and smiling. Service employees are entrusted with considerable responsibility. They are asked to connect with customers, manage their service encounters and achieve some standard of service excellence – usually relating to customer expectations. Interacting with customers requires employees to invest both emotional and mental forethought and apply a combination of interpersonal skills, sales skills, and self-monitoring skills. Moreover, they are usually expected to do this with grace, courtesy and empathy, while at the same time being effective and adaptable. Then they will be able to provide the unfailing services which are the keys to successful operation of hotels. Satisfied, excited visitors, gaining new knowledge and send friends and family to experience the same hospitality</p>

45,"<h2 class=""blog_entry-title"">UNPAID DOWER UNDER MUSLIM LAW</h2>","<div class=""entry-content"">
<div class=""featured-thumb"">
<a href=""#"">
</a>
</div>
<div class=""entry-content"">
<p>Dower is an important subject matter under the Islamic Law. It is a unique concept of Islamic matrimonial Law[1] and different from other systems of law because no other law prescribes anything about dower.[2] The Muslim/Islamic law requires specific commitments for a marriage that are needed to be satisfied keeping in mind the end goal to complete the valid marriage; one of them is the payment of dower.</p>
<p>It was observed in the case of <b>Abdul Kadir v. Salima</b>[3] that dower/Mahr was the exchange or consideration given by the man to the women, but an effect of the contract imposed by the law on the husband as a token of respect for the wife. The term consideration is explained by Mahmood J, Mahr has been compared to the price in a contract of sale because marriage is a civil contract and sale is a typical contract to which Muslim Jurists are accustomed to referring by way of analogy.[4]</p>
<p>In the case <b>Sayed Sabir Hussain v. Farsand Hussain</b>[5] the court concluded that the dower paid by the husband to wife is the legal responsibility of the husband. Further, it was observed in the case of <b>Anis Begam v. Mohd. Istafa</b>[6] it was held that under Muslim law it could not be treated purely as the sale of the person by the wife in consideration for the payment of dower.</p>
<p>The dower is used as a real settlement in favor of the wife, and to recheck whether any disproportionate power rests with the husband in relation to the divorce.[7] In what form dower should be paid, does not create any legal difference; it is the only compulsion to one party that makes a difference. But in reality, it cannot be seen in today society, in most of the cases it is seen that the dower which was specified during the marriage were due and which were unspecified that is remains unpaid lifelong.</p>
<p>So as to keep up the social and economic status, the husband proclaims the higher sum for dower trusting that they won’t be required to pay the dower once the marriage is performed. In the case of <b>Hammeera Bibi v Zubaida Bibi</b>[8] it was first time in the history of dower held by the Privy Council that the amount whatever is unpaid during the marriage should be paid in accordance with Islamic law and declared the right of the women to claim the unpaid dower with the interest amount which was contrary to the Islamic rule of law (taking of interest on loan amount).</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Dower</strong></p>
<p>It is clear now that dower is payable whether the entirety has been attached or not. A substantial Marriage isn’t conceivable without the dower. Along these lines as a matter of first importance, the dower might be determined or unspecified. Accordingly, there are basically two types of dower under Muslim Law. One is called as Specified and second one is called as Unspecified or proper dower. Specified dower further divided into two categories, prompt and deferred.</p>
<p>In these two-classification specified and unspecified dower, the court only deals with the issue of the amount payable during the marriage. On the other hand, in prompt and deferred dower court has to deals with the issue of time with respect to when the payment of dower has to be made.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Specified dower (mahrul-musamma)</strong>
<p>Across the Islamic world, the dower is fixed during the time of marriage and well before the marriage. It is fixed by the mutual consent of the parties. It is the nature of the dower that at whatever point the case of dower under the agreement is made by the spouse, the Court should, unless it is generally given by any authoritative authorization, grant the whole sum given in the contract.[9]</p>
<p>In the case of <b>Sayed Sabir Husain v. S. Farzand Hasan</b>[10] the father made himself the security for the amount of dower and in this way he dies. The court held that the home of the deceased subject to pay the child’s unpaid dower.<br/>
Â</p></li>
<li><strong>Prompt (muajjal) dower &amp; Deferred (muvajjal) dower</strong>
<p>The amount of dower which is paid under the specified dower is further divided into two heads that is prompt dower, which is payable on demand of wife at the time of marriage or any point of time. On the other side, deferred dower, this is paid in case of dissolution of marriage by divorce or death. The prompt portion of the dower may be realized by the wife at any time before or after consummation.â€[11]</p>
<p>In general, which part of dower is prompt and deferred is decided by the contract, which is known as <b>mahr-nama</b>. Usually, one half of the amount is fixed as prompt, and the other half is deferred dower. But, in this regard, there is no hard and fast rule. It is the custom under Islamic law to pay the prompt dower between the marriages or in case after the marriage when the wife demands it.[12]</p>
<p>In the case of <b>Mirza Bedar v Mirza Khurrum</b>[13] it was held that when parties have not stipulated as to which part of the dower is prompt and which part is deferred, according to <b>Shias</b>â€ the whole amount is considered as prompt. On the side of <b>Sunnis</b>â€ it is considered that one half is prompt and another one is deferred dower.</p>
<p>In <b>Sheik Mohammad v Ayesha</b>[14] the Madras High Court concluded that in the absence of any specific contract, the entire amount should be considered as prompt dower, irrespective of the fact whether parties are Shias or Sunnis. The question for the determination of prompt and deferred dower is again examined by the High Court of Lahore, in the case of <b>Nasiruddin v Amatul</b>[15] it was held that issue would be determined on the basis usages and customs. But in the absence of these custom and usages, one half is presumed to be prompt and the other half is deferred. Proportion of deferred and prompt dower is varying from case to case.[16]</p></li>
<li><strong>Unspecified dower (mahrul misal)</strong>
<p>In case the amount of dower is not fixed at the time or before the marriage then the dower of the wife is decided by the court relying on the various factors that are according to local customs, position of husbands, position of wifeâ€™s father, reference to dower of female paternal relations, personal qualifications that dower is known as unspecified dower.</p>
<p>The proper dower of women is regulated by a regard to the nobility of her birth, the beauty of her person and the custom of her female relations.â€[17]</p>
<p>In the case of <b>Najmoodeen v Beebee Husseinnie</b>[18], it was held that on deciding unspecified dower the Muslim authorities do not favor taking into consideration the husband social status and position.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Status of Unpaid Dower</strong></p>
<p>The legal obligation of the husband under the Muslim Law is to pay dower to the wife. An unpaid dower resembles like a simple debt in which the husband is like a debtor, and the wife is like a creditor. In the case of <b>Hamira Bibi v Zubaida Bibi</b>[19], it was held that the widow has a special right to demand the unpaid dower to his husband. Further it in this regard it was coated that <b>dower is an essential incident under the Muslim Law to the status of marriage…. the dower ranks as a debt and the wife are entitled, along with other creditors, to have it satisfied on the death of the husband out of his estate</b>.</p>
<p>Now matters come into consideration that whether widow can exercise right to retain possession of her husband property in lieu of unpaid dower is debatable and still into consideration. In the case Babee Bachum v Hamid Hussain[20], it was held that the possession of the husband property could be acquired by the wife in lieu of the unpaid dower without force or fraud. The same principle lay down in the case of Mania Bibi v Chaudhri Vakil Ahmad[21] where it was held that property should be peaceably and lawfully acquired. Further, the court contended that when the possession of the husband property is peacefully and lawfully obtained, the right of the widow to retain it till her dower debt is paid is confirmed on her by the Muslim Law.</p>
<p>Now again matter come into the consideration that whether the widow right of retention in lieu of unpaid dower is transferable and heritable. There is a plethora of conflicting judicial opinion on this point. Some of the cases in which the court held that right of retention of the property are not heritable right.[22]</p>
<p>On the other hand, contrary to this rule in the case of Mir Vaheed Ali v Rashid Beg[23], it was held that the right of retention of the property is heritable. Further Mysore High court in the case of <b>Hussain v Rahim Khan</b>[24] held that the right is both heritable and transferable. On contrary Patna High court deciding the same issue in the case of <b>Zobair Ahmad v Jainandon Parasad</b>[25] held that it is not transferable.</p>
<p>According to the Supreme Court in <b>Kapore Chand v Kedar Unnissa</b>[26] the right to possession of the property is not a transferable right.</p>
<p>In <b>Ghouse Yar khan v Fatim Begham</b>[27], it was held by Andhra Pradesh High court that possession of the property by widow my retained for unpaid dower under Muslim law this right can be alienated and inherited.</p>
<p>Not all rights available with a mortgagee are available to a Muslim widow. Hence, in case the possession of a deceased husbandâ€™s property is obtained by his widow and it is a property that has already been mortgaged to another person, and a suit is brought about by the mortgagee on the basis of which the property under consideration is sold off, the widow can be dispossessed by the purchaser and the right to obtain possession cannot be set up by her unless the debt of dower is paid.</p>
<p>There are conflicting opinions of various high courts and the Supreme Court on the status of unpaid dower with regard to the rights of women when dower is unpaid. So, we can say that the court has failed to explain all the possibly existing rights of the women when dower is not to be paid by the husband.</p>
<p>In the case of <b>Shahana Bibi v Nadeem Shah</b>[28] it was held that, in case of mental cruelty, non-payment of maintenance allowance, expulsion from the house by the husband, are the ground for the dissolution of marriage and hence they are entitled to the recovery of dower that was unpaid and also maintenance.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>The practices with respect payment of dower are still continuing in Islamic Marriages Law. Payment dower continues to hold essential in Islamic marriages. It was concluded from the case law that women have special rights to claim her unpaid dower and husband have a legal obligation to pay such amount. In lieu of unpaid dower, women can exercise her right to retain the property of the husband is still conflicting. In this respect, the High Courts and Supreme Court across the country have expressed different opinions. There is no single position of law that they have arrived at.</p>
<p>As far as unpaid dower is concerned, the majority opinion suggests that unpaid dower basically remains as a debt that must be paid by the husband to wife in case of Muslim marriages. Additionally, the general opinion on whether a widow has the right to retain possession of the property after the husband has deceased is that the women do have the right, but the same is not transferable. As said previously, different opinions on this issue have been given by different Courts across the country. What remains to be seen is how the jurisprudence on this will further develop and affect the rights with respect to the dower of women married under Muslim law.</p>

<li style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><u>Shoe</u></strong></li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A shoe is an item of footwear evolved at first to protect the human foot and later as an item of decoration. The foot contains more bones than any other single part of the body, and has evolved over hundreds of thousands of years in relation to vastly varied terrain and climatic conditions. Together with the proprioceptive system, it is what makes balance and ambulation possible.</p>
<p>The design of shoes has varied enormously through time, and from culture to culture, with appearance originally being tied to function. Additionally fashion has often dictated whether shoes have, for example, very high heels or no heels at all. Contemporary footwear varies in style, complexity and cost, from the most basic sandal, via high fashion shoes for women sometimes costing thousands of dollars a pair, to complex boots specially designed for mountaineering or skiing. Shoes have traditionally been made from leather, wood or canvas, but are increasingly made from rubber, plastics, and other petrochemical-derived materials.<br/>
<strong><u>Shoe Upper</u></strong><br/>
The shoe upper is an assembly of the upper footwear part. It protects the upper portion and sides of the foot. According to the function and location, it is divided into three basic groups:</p>
<ol style=""list-style-type: lower-alpha;"">
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Shoe upper parts &amp; components.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Lining parts &amp; components.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Reinforcing parts &amp; components.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
<u>a. Shoe upper parts &amp; components:</u><br/>
They form the external upper part. During production and while worn they are subjected to a lot of stress. The basic shoe upper components are:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Toe cap</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Vamp</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Quarter</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Counter</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Tongue</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Back strap</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
<u>b. Lining parts &amp; components:</u><br/>
During production and when the footwear is worn the lining is most in the back part and in toe cap, the dividing of lining varies and is dependent on the type of footwear.<br/>
In most cases Lining parts &amp; components is divided into:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Vamp lining</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Quarter lining</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Stay facing lining</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Heel grip</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Tongue lining</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
These parts are the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Improve the comfort at walking.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Enhance footwear appearance.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Insulate the foot from heat.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Increase the life of footwear.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
<u>Reinforcing parts &amp; components:</u><br/>
Their task is to reinforce the upper material in region where it is most stressed to ensure the right appearance and shape of footwear. They are inserted mostly between upper and lining parts. Normally the following parts are reinforced:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Stay facing</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Toe puff</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Cross piece</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Counter stiffener</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Eyelet</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Back straps</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Buckle</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Velcro</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Saddle</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Quarter stay joining</li>
</ul>

Fig: 2 : Various Parts Of Shoe</p>
<p><strong><u>The materials which are mainly used in footwear industry as upper materials:</u></strong></p>
<p>The footwear industry is a diverse manufacturing sector which employs a wide variety of materials to make products ranging from different types and styles of footwear to more specialized shoes. Leather, synthetic materials, rubber and textile materials are amongst the basic materials most commonly used in shoe manufacture; each material has its own specific characteristics. Materials significantly influence, not only the life of the footwear but also the end-of-life treatment of the product. Approximately 40 different materials can be used in the manufacturing of a shoe [2]. However, the common material composition of a typical shoe is presented in Table 1.</p>

</p><p><strong>1.1 Leather</strong></p>
<p>Fig: 03: Footwear Material: Leather<br/>
Leather is a wonderful and primary material for shoe upper. Its unique properties and characteristics make it the ideal choice for many different applications. Here we will discuss some of the most useful properties of leather.<br/>
It has a high tensile strength and is resistant to tearing, flexing and puncturing. This helps leather items last for a long time while retaining their look and feel.<br/>
It is a good heat barrier and provides excellent heat insulation. Leather contains a large amount of air and air is a poor conductor of heat. This makes leather a very comfortable item for the human skin.<br/>
It is able to hold large quantities of water vapor such as human perspiration and then dissipate it later. This makes leather a comfortable item to wear or sit on.<br/>
Leather’s thermostatic properties make it warm in the winter and cool in the summer. This makes leather comfortable to wear.<br/>
It can be made to stiffen or can be made to be flexible. It can be molded into a certain shape and then remolded into another shape later.<br/>
Leather is resistant to abrasion in both wet and dry environments. This makes leather an excellent protector of human skin.<br/>
It is resistant to heat and fire. It is also resistant to fungal growth such as mildew.<br/>
It consists of many fibers that are breathable. This breath ability makes it very comfortable to wear in any climate.<br/>
Leather can be dyed many different colors that makes it attractive in the production of leather clothing, as a cover for furniture and for many other color sensitive applications.<br/>
It is can be soft and supple. Leather clothing becomes a literal second skin. It warms to your body temperature. It is not itchy and does not scratch. It is non-irritating to the skin.<br/>
Leather is a fantastic material with excellent physical properties that enables it to be used in many diverse applications from shoe upper to soling.<br/>
<strong>1.2 Textile &amp; fabrics</strong><br/>
Fabric, or cloth, is a supple artificial material which is made up of a network of artificial or natural fibers (yarn or thread) formed by knitting (textiles) or weaving, or pressed into felt. The terms material and fabric are frequently used in the weaving assembly trades such as dressmaking and tailoring, and are synonyms for cloth.<br/>
Fabric is most often used in the manufacture of shoe as upper materials. Before woven cloth made its appearance, the roles of textiles had been fulfilled by leather and furs.<br/>
There are a large number of different types of fabric, each has its own unique fabric properties such as strength and degree of durability, color hue and color intensity. The thickness, one of the fabric properties, is estimated in deniers. The term “micro-fiber” denotes fibers that are made of strands with the thickness less than one denier. Here are some types of fabric followed by a short description of a few most used types: cotton, wool, silk, polyester, nylon, viscous rayon, Acrylics, jute etc.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 Rayon</strong></p>
<p>Fig: 04: Footwear Material: Rayon</p>
<ul style=""list-style-type: circle;"">
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">is a manufactured regenerated cellulose fiber. Because it is produced from naturally occurring polymers it is neither a truly synthetic fiber nor a natural fiber; it is a semi-synthetic fiber. Rayon is known by the names <em>viscose rayon</em> and <em>art silk</em> in the textile industry. It usually has a high luster quality giving it a bright sheen.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Rayon is a very versatile fiber and has the same comfort properties as natural fibers. It can imitate the feel and texture of silk, wool, cotton and linen. The fibers are easily dyed in a wide range of colors. Rayon fabrics are soft, smooth, cool, comfortable, and highly absorbent, but they do not insulate body heat, making them ideal for use in hot and humid climates.<br/>
The durability and appearance retention of regular rayon are low, especially when wet; also, rayon has the lowest elastic recovery of any fiber. However, HWM rayon is much stronger and exhibits higher durability and appearance retention. Recommended care for regular rayon is dry-cleaning only. HWM rayon can be machine washed.</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It is strong and durable.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It is extremely absorbent.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It is soft and comfortable.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It is breathable.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It is easily dyed in vivid colors.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It is abrasion resistant.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It resists insect damage.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It does not pill.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It drapes well and does not have a problem with static.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It wrinkles easily.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It loses 30% to 50% of its strength when wet.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>1.4 Wool</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Fig: 05: Footwear Material: Wool<br/>
Long and short hair wool at the South Central Family Farm Research Center in Booneville, Arkansas The term wool is usually restricted to describing the fibrous protein derived from the specialized skin cells called follicles in sheep. Wool is taken from animals in the Caprinae family, principally sheep, but the hair of certain species of other mammals is also sometimes called “wool”, including cashmere from goats, mohair from goats, vicuña, alpaca, and camel from animals in the camel family, and angora from rabbits.<br/>
Wool has several qualities that distinguish it from hair or fur: it is crimped, it has a different texture or handle, it is elastic, and it grows in<br/>
The quality of wool is determined by the following factors, fiber diameter, crimp, yield, color, and staple strength. Fiber diameter is the single most important wool characteristic determining quality and price.<br/>
Merino wool is typically 3-5 inches in length and is very fine (between 12-24 microns). The finest and most valuable wool comes from Merino hoggets. Wool taken from sheep produced for meat is typically more coarse, and has fibers that are 1.5 to 6 inches in length. Damage or breaks in the wool can occur if the sheep is stressed while it is growing its fleece, resulting in a thin spot where the fleece is likely to break.<br/>
Wool is also separated into grades based on the measurement of the wool’s diameter in microns and also its style. These grades may vary depending on the breed or purpose of the wool. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">&lt;15.5 – Ultra fine Merino</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">15.6-18.5 – Superfine Merino</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">18.6-20 – Fine Merino</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">20.1-23 – Medium Merino</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">23&lt; – Strong Merino</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Comeback: 21-26 microns, white, 90-180 mm long</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Fine crossbred: 27-31 microns, Creedless etc.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Medium crossbred: 32–35 microns</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Downs: 23-34 microns, typically lacks luster and brightness. Examples, Aussiedown, Dorset Horn, Suffolk etc.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Coarse crossbred: 36&gt; microns</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Carpet wools: 35-45 microns</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>1.5 Cotton</strong></p>
<p>Fig: 06: Footwear Material: Cotton<br/>
Cotton is a soft, fluffy, staple fiber that grows in a boll around the seeds of the cotton plant. It is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including the Americas, India and Africa. The fiber most often is spun into yarn or thread and used to make a soft, breathable textile, which is the most widely used natural-fiber cloth in clothing today.</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It is soft</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It “breathes”</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It absorbs body moisture</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It is comfortable</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It is strong and durable</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It is versatile</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It performs well</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It has good color retention</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It is easy to print on</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It wrinkles easily</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It is easy to care for, easy to wash</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It is a natural resource that is fully renewable</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
<strong>1.6 Silk</strong></p>
<p>Fig: 07: Footwear Material: Silk<br/>
Silk is a natural protein fiber, some forms of which can be woven into textiles. The best-known type of silk is obtained from cocoons made by the larvae of the mulberry silkworm <em>Bombyx mori</em> reared in captivity (sericulture). The shimmering appearance of silk is due to the triangular prism-like structure of the silk fiber which allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at different angles thus producing different colors.<br/>
Silks are produced by several other insects, but only the silk of moth caterpillars has been used for textile manufacture. There has been some research into other silks, which differ at the molecular level. Silks are mainly produced by the larvae of insects that complete metamorphosis, but also by some adult insects such as web spinners. Silk production is especially common in the Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and ants), and is sometimes used in nest construction. Other types of arthropod produce silk, most notably various arachnids such as spiders (see spider silk).</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Silk fibers from the <em>Bombyx mori</em> silkworm have a triangular cross section with rounded corners, 5-10 μm wide. The fibroin-heavy chain is composed mostly of beta-sheets, due to a 59-mer amino acid repeat sequence with some variations.<sup>[14]</sup></li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">The flat surfaces of the fibrils reflect light at many angles, giving silk a natural shine. The cross-section from other silkworms can vary in shape and diameter: crescent-like for <em>Anaphe</em> and elongated wedge for <em>tussah</em>. Silkworm fibers are naturally extruded from two silkworm glands as a pair of primary filaments (brin) which are stuck together, with sericin proteins acting like glue, to form a bave. Bave diameters for tussah silk can reach 65 μm. See cited reference for cross-sectional SEM photographs.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Silk has a smooth, soft texture that is not slippery, unlike many synthetic fibers. Its denier is 4.5 g/d when dry and 2.8-4.0 g/d when moist.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Silk is one of the strongest natural fibers but loses up to 20% of its strength when wet. It has a good moisture regain of 11%. Its elasticity is moderate to poor: if elongated even a small amount, it remains stretched. It can be weakened if exposed to too much sunlight. It may also be attacked by insects, especially if left dirty.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Silk is a poor conductor of electricity and thus susceptible to static cling.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Unwashed silk chiffon may shrink up to 8% due to a relaxation of the fiber macrostructure. So silk should either be pre-washed prior to garment construction, or dry cleaned. Dry cleaning may still shrink the chiffon up to 4%. Occasionally, this shrinkage can be reversed by a gentle steaming with a press cloth. There is almost no gradual shrinkage nor shrinkage due to molecular-level deformation.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Silk is made up of the amino acids Gly-Ser-Gly-Ala and forms Beta pleated sheets. H-bonds form between chains, and side chains form above and below the plane of the H-bond network.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">The high proportion (50%) of glycine, which is a small amino acid, allows tight packing and the fibers are strong and resistant to stretching. The tensile strength is due to the many interseeded hydrogen bonds. Since the protein forms a Beta sheet, when stretched the force is applied to these strong bonds and they do not break.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Silk is resistant to most mineral acids, except for sulfuric acid which dissolves it. It is yellowed by perspiration.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>1.7 Nylon</strong></p>
<p>Fig: 08:  Footwear Material: Nylon<br/>
Nylon is a generic designation for a family of synthetic polymers known generically as polyamides and first produced on February 28, 1935 by Wallace Caruthers at DuPont. Nylon is one of the most commonly used polymers.</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Variation of luster: nylon has the ability to be very lustrous, semi lustrous or dull.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Durability: its high tenacity fibers are used for seatbelts, tire cords, ballistic cloth and other uses.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">High elongation</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Excellent abrasion resistance</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Highly resilient (nylon fabrics are heat-set)</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Paved the way for easy-care garments</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">High resistance to insects, fungi, animals, as well as molds, mildew, rot and many chemicals</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Used in carpets and nylon stockings</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Melts instead of burning</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Used in many military applications</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Good specific strength</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Transparent under infrared light (-12dB) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nylon#cite_note-1""><sup>[2]</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Above their melting temperatures, <em>T</em><sub>m</sub>, thermoplastics like nylon are amorphous solids or viscous fluids in which the chains approximate random coils. Below <em>T</em><sub>m</sub>, amorphous regions alternate with regions which are lamellar crystals. The amorphous regions contribute elasticity and the crystalline regions contribute strength and rigidity. The planar amide (-CO-NH-) groups are very polar, so nylon forms multiple hydrogen bonds among adjacent strands. Because the nylon backbone is so regular and symmetrical, especially if all the amide bonds are in the <em>trans</em> configuration, nylons often have high crystallinity and make excellent fibers. The amount of crystallinity depends on the details of formation, as well as on the kind of nylon. Apparently it can never be quenched from a melt as a completely amorphous solid.<br/>
Nylon 6,6 can have multiple parallel strands aligned with their neighboring peptide bonds at coordinated separations of exactly 6 and 4 carbons for considerable lengths, so the carbonyl oxygen and amide hydrogen’s can line up to form interchain hydrogen bonds repeatedly, without interruption. Nylon 5,10 can have coordinated runs of 5 and 8 carbons. Thus parallel (but not ant parallel) strands can participate in extended, unbroken, multi-chain β-pleated sheets, a strong and tough super molecular structure similar to that found in natural silk fibroin and the β-keratins in feathers. (Proteins have only an amino acid α-carbon separating sequential -CO-NH- groups.) Nylon 6 will form uninterrupted H-bonded sheets with mixed directionalities, but the β-sheet wrinkling is somewhat different. The three-dimensional disposition of each alkenes hydrocarbon chain depends on rotations about the 109.47° tetrahedral bonds of singly-bonded carbon atoms.<br/>
Block nylon tends to be less crystalline, except near the surfaces due to shearing stresses during formation. Nylon is clear and colorless, or milky, but is easily dyed. Multithreaded nylon cord and rope is slippery and tends to unravel. The ends can be melted and fused with a heat source such as a flame or electrode to prevent this.</p>

<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It is strong and elastic.</li>

<p><strong>1.9 Jute</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Fig: 09: Footwear Material: Jute<br/>
Jute is a long, soft, shiny vegetable fiber that can be spun into coarse, strong threads. It is reduced from plants in the genus <em>Corchorus</em>, family Tiliaceae.<br/>
Jute is one of the most affordable natural fibers and is second only to cotton in amount produced and variety of uses. Jute fibres are composed primarily of the plant materials cellulose (major component of plant fiber) and lignin (major components of wood fiber). It is thus a lignocelluloses fiber that is partially a textile fiber and partially wood. It falls into the best fiber category (fiber collected from bast or skin of the plant) along with knave, industrial hemp, flax (linen), ramie, etc. The industrial term for jute fiber is <em>raw jute</em>. The fibers are off-white to brown, and 1–4 meters (3–12 feet) long.<br/>
Jute fiber is often called Hessian; jute fabrics are also called Hessian cloth and jute sacks are called gunny bags in some European countries. The fabric made from jute is popularly known as burlap in North America.</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Jute fiber is 100% bio-degradable and recyclable and thus environmentally friendly.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It is a natural fiber with golden and silky shine and hence called <em>The Golden Fiber</em>.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It is the cheapest vegetable fiber procured from the best or skin of the plant’s stem.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It is the second most important vegetable fiber after cotton, in terms of usage, global consumption, production, and availability.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It has high tensile strength, low extensibility, and ensures better breath ability of fabrics. Therefore, jute is very suitable in agricultural commodity bulk packaging.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">It helps to make best quality industrial yarn, fabric, net, and sacks. It is one of the most versatile natural fibers that have been used in raw materials for packaging, textiles, non-textile, construction, and agricultural sectors. Bulking of yarn results in a reduced breaking tenacity and an increased breaking extensibility when blended as a ternary blend.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Unlike the hemp fiber, jute is not a form of cannabis.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Advantages of jute include good insulating and antistatic properties, as well as having low thermal conductivity and a moderate moisture regain. Other advantages of jute include acoustic insulating properties and manufacture with no skin irritations.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Jute has the ability to be blended with other fibers, both synthetic and natural, and accepts cellulose dye classes such as natural, basic, vat, sulfur, reactive, and pigment dyes. As the demand for natural comfort fibers increases, the demand for jute and other natural fibers that can be blended with cotton will increase. To meet this demand, it has been suggested that the natural fiber industry adopt the Reiter’s Elite system, in order to modernize processing. The resulting jute/cotton yarns will produce fabrics with a reduced cost of wet processing treatments. Jute can also be blended with wool. By treating jute with caustic soda, crimp, softness, pliability, and appearance is improved, aiding in its ability to be spun with wool. Liquid ammonia has a similar effect on jute, as well as the added characteristic of improving flame resistance when treated with flame proofing agents.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Some noted disadvantages include poor derivability and crease resistance, brittleness, fiber shedding, and yellowing in sunlight. However, preparation of fabrics with castor oil lubricants result in less yellowing and less fabric weight loss, as well as increased dyeing brilliance. Jute has a decreased strength when wet, and also becomes subject to microbial attack in humid climates. Jute can be processed with an enzyme in order to reduce some of its brittleness and stiffness. Once treated with an enzyme, jute shows an affinity to readily accept natural dyes, which can be made from marigold flower extract. In one attempt to dye jute fabric with this extract, bleached fabric was mordent with ferrous soleplate, increasing the fabric’s dye uptake value. Jute also responds well to reactive dyeing.</li>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>1.10 Acrylic fiber</strong></p>
<p>Fig: 10: Footwear Material: Acrylic fiber<br/>
Acrylic fibers are synthetic fibers made from a polymer (Polyacrylonitrile) with an average molecular weight of ~100,000, about 1900 monomer units. To be called acrylic in the U.S, the polymer must contain at least 85% acrylonitrile monomer. Typical co monomers are vinyl acetate or methyl acryl ate. The DuPont Corporation created the first acrylic fibers in 1941 and trademarked them under the name “Orlon”.</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Acrylic is lightweight, soft, and warm, with a wool-like feel. Acrylic is colored before it is turned into a fiber as it does not dye very well but has excellent colorfastness. Its fibers aren’t very resilient, and wrinkle easily, but most acrylic fabrics have good wrinkle resistance. Acrylic has recently been used in clothing as a less expensive alternative to cashmere, due to the similar feeling of the materials. The disadvantages of acrylic are that it tends to fuzz or pill easily and that it does not insulate the wearer as well as cashmere. Many products like fake pashmina or cash mina use this fiber to create the illusion of cashmere.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Acrylic is resistant to moths, oils, chemicals, and is very resistant to deterioration from sunlight exposure. However, static and pilling can be a problem.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Acrylic has a bad reputation amongst many knitters – however cheap the yarn is, its performance does not come near natural fibers. Also, some knitters complain that the fiber “squeaks” when knitted.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Acrylic can irritate the skin of people with eczema.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
<strong>1.11 Others</strong><br/>
A small extension of Polyethylene, Polyvinyl acetate, Polyvinyl chloride(PVC), Polyurethane(PU), Thermoplastic Rubber(TPR), Cellulose Rubber etc are used in footwear industry as upper materials. However, they are highly used as the soling materials in footwear industry.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter Two</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wastage management &amp; </strong><strong>Wastage Management in Footwear Industries</strong><br/>
<strong>Waste management</strong> is the collection, transport, processing, recycling or disposal, and monitoring of waste materials. The term usually relates to materials produced by human activity, and is generally undertaken to reduce their effect on health, the environment or aesthetics. Waste management is also carried out to recover resources from it. Waste management can involve solid, liquid, gaseous or radioactive substances, with different methods and fields of expertise for each.<br/>
Waste management practices differ for developed and developing nations, for urban and rural areas, and for residential and industrial producers. Management for non-hazardous residential and institutional waste in metropolitan areas is usually the responsibility of local government authorities, while management for non-hazardous commercial and industrial waste is usually the responsibility of the generator.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><u><strong>2.1 Waste management concepts</strong></u><br/>
There are a number of concepts about waste management which vary in their usage between countries or regions. Some of the most general, widely-used</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Fig: 11: Diagram of the waste hierarchy.</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Waste hierarchy</strong> – The waste hierarchy refers to the “3 Rs” reduce, reuse and recycle, which classify waste management strategies according to their desirability in terms of waste minimization. The waste hierarchy remains the cornerstone of most waste minimization strategies. The aim of the waste hierarchy is to extract the maximum practical benefits from products and to generate the minimum amount of waste.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Extended producer responsibility</strong> – Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is a strategy designed to promote the integration of all costs associated with products throughout their life cycle (including end-of-life disposal costs) into the market price of the product. Extended producer responsibility is meant to impose accountability over the entire lifecycle of products and packaging introduced to the market. This means that firms which manufacture, import and/or sell products are required to be responsible for the products after their useful life as well as during manufacture.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Polluter pays principle</strong> – the Polluter Pays Principle is a principle where the polluting party pays for the impact caused to the environment. With respect to waste management, this generally refers to the requirement for a waste generator to pay for appropriate disposal of the waste.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><u>2.2 Technologies</u></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Traditionally the waste management industry has been slow to adopt new technologies such as RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags, GPS and integrated software packages which enable better quality data to be collected without the use of estimation or manual data entry.</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Technologies like RFID tags are now being used to collect data on presentation rates for curb-side pick-ups which is useful when examining the usage of recycling bins or similar.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Benefits of GPS tracking is particularly evident when considering the efficiency of ad hoc pick-ups (like skip bins or dumpsters) where the collection is done on a consumer request basis.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Integrated software packages are useful in aggregating this data for use in optimisation of operations for waste collection operations.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Rear vision cameras are commonly used for OH&amp;S reasons and video recording devices are becoming more widely used, particularly concerning residential services and contaminations of the waste stream.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><u>2.3 Education and awareness</u></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Education and awareness in the area of waste and waste management is increasingly important from a global perspective of resource management. The Talloires Declaration is a declaration for sustainability concerned about the unprecedented scale and speed of environmental pollution and degradation, and the depletion of natural resources. Local, regional, and global air pollution; accumulation and distribution of toxic wastes; destruction and depletion of forests, soil, and water; depletion of the ozone layer and emission of “green house” gases threaten the survival of humans and thousands of other living species, the integrity of the earth and its biodiversity, the security of nations, and the heritage of future generations. Several universities have implemented the Talloires Declaration by establishing environmental management and waste management programs, e.g. the waste management university project. University and vocational education are promoted by various organizations, e.g. WAMITAB and Chartered Institution of Wastes Management. Many supermarkets encourage customers to use their reverse vending machines to deposit used purchased containers and receive a refund from the recycling fees. Brands that manufacture such machines include Tomra and Envipco.</p>
<p><strong><u>2.4 Footwear Wastage </u></strong></p>
<p>The footwear industry is a manufacturing sector which utilizes a wide variety of materials and processes to produce a range of distinctly different products, from sandals to specialized safety footwear. Shoes are designed to fulfill an array of consumer requirements relating to function and fashion, and incorporate varied range of designs and styles. In addition, a range of distinctly different materials such as leather, synthetic materials, rubber and textile are commonly used in shoe manufacturing.</p>
<p>Fig: 12: Material Composition in A Average Shoe (% wt)<br/>
These materials differ not only in their appearance but also in their physical qualities, their service life, the different treatment needs as well as their recycling and recovery options at the end of their useful life. There are approximately 40 different materials used in the manufacturing of a shoe1. For example, Figure 1 represents the average composition of a typical men’s shoe which has been measured after grinding. These variations in designs, styles and materials, together with the environmental and economic implications of end-of-life shoe processing determine the feasible approaches to deal with this rapidly increasing waste stream.</p>
<p>Over the last 20 years, the footwear sector has placed significant effort in improving material efficiency, as well as eliminating the use of hazardous materials during the production phase. However, the environmental gains made in production are being overtaken by the negative impact of the considerable increase in the demand for footwear products.</p>
<p>Worldwide footwear consumption has doubled every 20 years, from 2.5 billion pairs in 1950 to more than 20 billion pairs of shoes in 20052 (see Figure 2). As a result, the worldwide per capita consumption of footwear has also considerably increased, from 1 pair of shoes per year for every person in the world in 1950 to almost 2.6 pairs of shoes in 2005. In the European Union, footwear consumption has increased by 22% from 2002-2005 to reach 2.3 billion. However, the per capita figure differs significantly between each country4 (see Table 1). Although China has the highest footwear consumption in the world, the United States is the country with the highest per capita shoe consumption, since each inhabitant purchase an average of 6.9 pairs of shoes every year. At the other extreme, in the less developed countries, the per capita figure is 0.6 pairs for India and 0.5 pairs of shoes for Vietnam (which means one pair of shoes for each person every two years).</p>
<p>This rapid growth in shoe sales has also resulted in a significant increase in post-consumer footwear waste. In the EU, it is estimated that the waste arising from post-consumer shoes will reach 1.2 million tones per year. The retail figure for 2003 indicated that around 338 million pairs of shoes were sold in the UK. Based on this figure, it is estimated that the waste arising from post-consumer shoes reached 169,000 tones. In addition, it has been estimated that the total arising of textile and footwear waste is approximately 1,165,000 tones per year in the UK, while the amount of textile waste reused or recycled annually we estimated to be 324,000 tones.</p>
<p>Tones of post-consumer shoes are collected each year for direct reuse in the UK or for exportation to developing countries. However, it is estimated that approximately 10% of the collected secondhand shoes are not suitable for reuse due to their condition, and consequently end up in landfill Therefore, based on these estimates, approximately 15% (26,244 tones) of post consumer shoe waste in the UK are collected and re-distributed as second hand shoes, while the rest (85% or 142,756 tones) are disposed of in landfills. Waste disposal is increasingly regulated within the European Union. At the same time, waste management costs are increasing. With regards to waste management, the footwear industry needs: – guidelines in order to better anticipate future regulations and deal with them effectively, – a tool in order to estimate the effectiveness of the waste management. This European Standard incorporates such a tool, designed specifically for the footwear industry. In order to improve the waste management, the footwear manufacturer should perform the following tasks:
</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">reduce the quantity of waste,</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">reuse the waste,</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">recycle the waste,</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">incinerate and recover energy from the waste,</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Treat the waste.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
This document could be used by a company that wishes to implement the EN ISO 14001:1996 management system standard.<br/>
This document specifies the process steps which are involved in the generation of the waste from footwear manufacture and the usual waste management practices. It also establishes a European list of the usual wastes generated during the footwear manufacturing process. It can be applied to one specific product, a specific group of products, and one specific production technology within the factory or to the whole production of a company.</p>
<p>Unsustainable consumption and production patterns in the developed world have led to an increased generation of waste over many decades. Although local and national authorities, governmental agencies, manufacturers and the general public have come to recognize the importance of controlling waste at source, total waste elimination is not possible. There will always be some waste that cannot be prevented at source and so need to be treated at the end of its functional life. Considering the amount of end-of- life (EoL) waste generated every year, understanding and developing methods for EoL management is a major part of the overall waste management concern. The footwear industry over the last years has placed significant effort in improving energy and material efficiency, as well as eliminating the use of hazardous materials during the production phase. However, the environmental gains and energy efficiency made in production are being overtaken by the considerable increase in the demand for footwear products, the so called rebound effect. Moreover, the useful life of shoes is relatively short and progressively decreasing as a result of rapid market changes and consumer fashion trends. This creates a large waste stream of worn and discarded shoes at the time their functional life has ended, and most of them are being disposed in landfills. Producer-responsibility issues and forthcoming environmental legislations, as well as increasingly environmental consumer demands, are expected to challenge the way the footwear industry deals with its EoL products.</p>
<p>The footwear industry is a diverse manufacturing sector which employs a wide variety of materials to make products ranging from different types and styles of footwear to more specialized shoes. Leather, synthetic materials, rubber and textile materials are amongst the basic materials most commonly used in shoe manufacture; each material has its own specific characteristics. Materials significantly influence, not only the life of the footwear but also the end-of-life treatment of the product. Approximately 40 different materials can be used in the manufacturing of a shoe nowadays; the shoe industry is facing many of the same challenges as the consumer products and food industries. To meet the needs of customers and be competitive, footwear companies must face two key challenges: being quick to market changes and stay relevant in order to identify or establish new consumer trends. This leads to a shorter life cycle of shoes, and an even increasingly shorter product development cycle for the footwear industry. A shorter life cycle of shoes means that more shoes have been produced over the years, so leading to a higher level of EoL waste by the footwear industry. From 1990 to 2004, worldwide footwear production has increased by 70% to around 17 billion pairs of shoes while by 2010 experts in the sector expect the global footwear output to reach 20 billion pairs. Shoe production and consumption is definitely rising. Western Europe and United States consume 2 billion pairs of shoes each every year. In the UK alone, more than 330 million pairs of shoes, with a total market value of more than £5 billion are consumed every year.</p>
<p>There are many environmental pollution problems linked with the footwear industry. These occur both in the production of raw materials and with the footwear manufacturing itself. However, until recently the only major environmental concerns for the producers have shoes, and the air, water and solid waste emissions generated during the shoe production process. In fact, the most serious risks to the environment are to be found with suppliers of semi-finished products and components such as leather, which is produced by tanning.  Especially, the use of chromium as tanning agent, which is highly toxic to form oregano-chlorine substances, which are extremely toxic both for the environment and for human beings. Finally, solvents and other volatile organic compounds(VOCs), used in synthetic upper materials, leather finishing, adhesives and cleaners, are of major importance for the footwear industry since they contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone, an air pollutant harmful to human health as well as plant life [7]. Table 1presents some if the major pollutants that linked with footwear materials and their processes.</p>

In order to promote footwear products which have lower environmental impacts, the European Union (EU) recently has established the European Footwear Eco-Label scheme as a marketing and publicity tool for environmental-friendly shoes [8]. To be able to use the footwear eco-label some determined ecological criteria must be fulfilled. These criteria aim, in particular, at limiting the levels of toxic residues, limiting the emissions of VOCs and promoting a more durable footwear product However, the major environmental challenge that footwear industry is currently facing, is the enormous amount of waste generated at the end-of-life phase. Some12 billions pairs of shoes produced worldwide every year, with most of them being disposed in landfills. Landfill sites can result in serious environmental pollution of groundwater and rivers, due to landfill leach ate. Landfill space is also becoming extremely limited, especially in some European countries where available landfill space is non-existent. Finally, forthcoming product-related environmental legislation is expected to change the approach of the footwear industry regarding its EoL waste.</p>

<p><strong><u>3.6 Recycling of Footwear Wastages</u></strong><br/>
Recycling involves processing used materials into new products to prevent waste of potentially useful materials, reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, reduce energy usage, reduce air pollution (from incineration) and water pollution (from land filling) by reducing the need for “conventional” waste disposal, and lower greenhouse gas emissions as compared to virgin production. Recycling is a key component of modern waste reduction and is the third component of the “Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle” waste hierarchy.<br/>
Recyclable materials include many kinds of glass, paper, metal, plastic, textiles, and electronics. Although similar in effect, the composting or other reuse of biodegradable waste – such as food or garden waste – is not typically considered recycling. Materials to be recycled are either brought to a collection center or picked up from the curbside, then sorted, cleaned, and reprocessed into new materials bound for manufacturing. In a strict sense, recycling of a material would produce a fresh supply of the same material, for example used office paper to more office paper, or used foamed polystyrene to more polystyrene. However, this is often difficult or too expensive (compared with producing the same product from raw materials or other sources), so “recycling” of many products or materials involve their reuse in producing different materials (e.g., paperboard) instead. Another form of recycling is the salvage of certain materials from complex products, either due to their intrinsic value (e.g., lead from car batteries, or gold from computer components), or due to their hazardous nature (e.g., removal and reuse of mercury from various items).<br/>
<img alt=""sheep_nappa_garment_leather_scrap"" src=""file:///C:/Users/Papon/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image037.jpg"" style=""height: 285px; width: 559px;""/><br/>
Fig: 18: Leather Wastage<br/>
Critics dispute the net economic and environmental benefits of recycling over its costs, and suggest that proponents of recycling often make matters worse and suffer from confirmation bias. Specifically, critics argue that the costs and energy used in collection and transportation detract from (and outweigh) the costs and energy saved in the production process; also that the jobs produced by the recycling industry can be a poor trade for the jobs lost in logging, mining, and other industries associated with virgin production; and that materials such as paper pulp can only be recycled a few times before material degradation prevents further recycling. Proponents of recycling dispute each of these claims, and the validity of arguments from both sides has led to enduring controversy.<br/>
<strong>Nike</strong>’s recycling programme “Reuse-A-Shoe” is the only well known product take-back and recycling scheme of post-consumer shoes currently established by a shoe manufacturer. This programme has been operating for over a decade in the United States and also just recently started operating in the UK, Australia and Japan. Nike’s scheme involves a series of collection points in retail centers, sports stadia and university campuses where consumers can deposit their worn-out and discarded athletic shoes. The shoes are then collected and taken to a central recycling facility where they are shredded to produce a material known as “Nike Grind”, which is used for surfacing tennis and basketball courts, playgrounds and running tracks. According to Nike, since its inception in 1993, “Reuse-A-Shoe” programme has recycled in total more than 20 million pairs of worn-out and defective athletic shoes.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><u>3.6.1 Process</u></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The process of recycling involves the following steps:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Collection</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A number of different systems have been implemented to collect recyclates from the general waste stream. These systems tend to lie along the spectrum of trade-off between public convenience and government ease and expense. The three main categories of collection are “drop-off centers”, “buy-back centers” and “curbside collection”.<br/>
Drop-off centers require the waste producer to carry the rescales to a central location, either an installed or mobile collection station or the reprocessing plant itself. They are the easiest type of collection to establish, but suffer from low and unpredictable throughput. Buy-back centers differ in that the cleaned rescales are purchased, thus providing a clear incentive for use and creating a stable supply. The post-processed material can then be sold on, hopefully creating a profit.</p>
<p>Unfortunately government subsidies are necessary to make buy-back centers a viable enterprise, as according to the United States Nation Solid Wastes Management Association it costs on average US$50 to process a ton of material, which can only be resold for US$30.<br/>
Fig: 19: Wastage Collecting Vehicle<br/>
At one end of the spectrum is mixed waste collection, in which all rescales are collected mixed in with the rest of the waste, and the desired material is then sorted out and cleaned at a central sorting facility. This results in a large amount of recyclable waste, paper especially, being too soiled to reprocess, but has advantages as well: the city need not pay for a separate collection of rescales and no public education is needed. Any changes to which materials are recyclable is easy to accommodate as all sorting happens in a central location.<br/>
In a Commingled or single-stream system, all recyclables for collection are mixed but kept separate from other waste. This greatly reduces the need for post-collection cleaning but does require public education on what materials are recyclable.<br/>
Source separation is the other extreme, where each material is cleaned and sorted prior to collection. This method requires the least post-collection sorting and produces the purest rescales, but incurs additional operating costs for collection of each separate material. An extensive public education program is also required, which must be successful if recycled contamination is to be avoided.<br/>
Source separation used to be the preferred method due to the high sorting costs incurred by commingled collection. Advances in sorting technology (see sorting below), however, have lowered this overhead substantially—many areas which had developed source separation programs have since switched to commingled collection.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Sorting</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Once commingled rescales are collected and delivered to a central collection facility, the different types of materials must be sorted. This is done in a series of stages, many of which involve automated processes such that a truck-load of material can be fully sorted in less than an hour. Some plants can now sort the materials automatically, known as single-stream recycling. A 30 percent increase in recycling rates has been seen in the areas where these plants exist.<br/>
Initially, the commingled rescales are removed from the collection vehicle and placed on a conveyor belt spread out in a single layer. Large pieces of corrugated fiberboard and plastic bags are removed by hand at this stage, as they can cause later machinery to jam.<br/>
Fig: 20: Waste Sorting<br/>
Next, automated machinery separates the rescales by weight, splitting lighter paper and plastic from heavier glass and metal. Cardboard is removed from the mixed paper, and the most common types of plastic, PET (#1) and HDPE (#2), are collected. This separation is usually done by hand, but has become automated in some sorting centers: a spectroscopic scanner is used to differentiate between different types of paper and plastic based on the absorbed wavelengths, and subsequently divert each material into the proper collection channel.<br/>
Strong magnets are used to separate out ferrous metals, such as iron, steel, and tin-plated steel cans (“tin cans”). Non-ferrous metals are ejected by magnetic eddy currents in which a rotating magnetic field induces an electric current around the aluminum cans, which in turn creates a magnetic eddy current inside the cans. This magnetic eddy current is repulsed by a large magnetic field, and the cans are ejected from the rest of the recycled stream.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Treatments</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The sorted materials are then treated as their physical and chemical properties and as the product desired.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><u>3.6.2 Reuse</u></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Reuse is to use an item more than once. This includes conventional reuse where the item is used again for the same function and new-life reuse where it is used for a new function. In contrast, recycling is the breaking down of the used item into raw materials which are used to make new items. By taking useful products and exchanging those, without reprocessing, reuse help save time, money, energy, and resources. In broader economic terms, reuse offers quality products to people and organizations with limited means, while generating jobs and business activity that contribute to the economy.</p>
<p>Fig: 21: Footwear Disposal<br/>
Historically, financial motivation was one of the main drivers of reuse. In the developing world this driver can lead to very high levels of reuse, however rising wages and consequent consumer demand for the convenience of disposable products has made the reuse of low value items such as packaging uneconomic in richer countries, leading to the demise of many reuse programs. Current environmental awareness is gradually changing attitudes and regulations, such as the new packaging regulations, are gradually beginning to reverse the situation.<br/>
The classic example of conventional reuse is the doorstep delivery of milk in refillable bottles; other examples include the rethreading of tires and the use of reusable plastic boxes (transit packing) instead of single-use cardboard cartons.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Advantages &amp; disadvantages</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Reuse has certain potential advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Energy and raw materials savings as replacing many single use products with one reusable one reduces the number that need to be manufactured.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Reduced disposal needs and costs.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Refurbishment can bring sophisticated, sustainable, well paid jobs to underdeveloped economies.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Cost savings for business and consumers as a reusable product is often cheaper than the many single use products it replaces.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Some older items were better handcrafted and appreciate in value.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Disadvantages are also apparent:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Reuse often requires cleaning or transport, which have environmental costs.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Some items, such as Freon appliances or infant auto seats, could be hazardous or less energy efficient as they continue to be used.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Reusable products need to be more durable than single-use products, and hence require more material per item. This is particularly significant if only a small proportion of the reusable products are in fact reused.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Sorting and preparing items for reuse takes time, which is inconvenient for consumers and costs money for businesses?</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Comparison to recycling</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Recycling differs from reuse in that it breaks down the item into raw materials which are then used to make new items, as opposed to reusing the intact item. As this extra processing requires energy, as a rule of thumb reuse is environmentally preferable to recycling (“reduce, reuse, recycle”), though recycling does have a significant part to play as it can often make use of items which are broken, worn out or otherwise unsuitable for reuse. However, as transport emissions are significant portion of the environmental impact of both reuse and recycling, in some cases recycling is the more prudent course as reuse can require long transport distances? A complex life cycle analysis may be required during a products design phase to determine the efficacy of reuse, recycling, or neither, and produce accordingly.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><u>3.6.3 Landfill</u></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A landfill, also known as a dump or rubbish dump (and historically as a maiden), is a site for the disposal of waste materials by burial and is the oldest form of waste treatment. Historically, landfills have been the most common methods of organized waste disposal and remain so in many places around the world.<br/>
Landfills may include internal waste disposal sites (where a producer of waste carries out their own waste disposal at the place of production) as well as sites used by many producers. Many landfills are also used for other waste management purposes, such as the temporary storage, consolidation and transfer, or processing of waste material (sorting, treatment, or recycling).<br/>
A landfill also may refer to ground that has been filled in with soil and rocks instead of waste materials, so that it can be used for a specific purpose, such as for building houses. Unless they are stabilized, these areas may experience severe shaking or liquefaction of the ground in a large earthquake.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Operations</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Typically, in non hazardous waste landfills, in order to meet predefined specifications, techniques are applied by which the wastes are:</p>
<ol>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Confined to as small an area as possible.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Compacted to reduce their volume.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Covered (usually daily) with layers of soil.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">During landfill operations the waste collection vehicles are weighed at a weighbridge on arrival and their load is inspected for wastes that do not accord with the landfill’s waste acceptance criteria. Afterwards, the waste collection vehicles use the existing road network on their way to the tipping face or working front where they unload their load. After loads are deposited, compactors or dozers are used to spread and compact the waste on the working face. Before leaving the landfill boundaries, the waste collection vehicles pass through the wheel cleaning facility. If necessary, they return to the weighbridge in order to be weighed without their load. Through the weighing process, the daily incoming waste tonnage can be calculated and listed in databases. In addition to trucks, some landfills may be equipped to handle railroad containers. The use of ‘rail-haul’ permits landfills to be located at more remote sites, without the problems associated with many truck trips.<br/>
Typically, in the working face, the compacted waste is covered with soil daily. Alternative waste-cover materials are several sprayed-on foam products and temporary blankets. Blankets can be lifted into place with tracked excavators and then removed the following day prior to waste placement. Chipped wood and chemically ‘fixed’ bio-solids may also be used as an alternate daily cover. The space that is occupied daily by the compacted waste and the cover material is called a daily cell. Waste compaction is critical to extending the life of the landfill. Factors such as waste compressibility, waste layer thickness and the number of passes of the compactor over the waste affect the waste densities.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Impacts</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A large number of adverse impacts may occur from landfill operations. These impacts can vary: fatal accidents (e.g., scavengers buried under waste piles); infrastructure damage (e.g., damage to access roads by heavy vehicles); pollution of the local environment (such as contamination of groundwater and/or aquifers by leakage and residual soil contamination during landfill usage, as well as after landfill closure); off gassing of methane generated by decaying organic wastes (methane is a greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide, and can itself be a danger to inhabitants of an area); harboring of disease vectors such as rats and flies, particularly from improperly operated landfills, which are common in Third-world countries; injuries to wildlife; and simple nuisance problems (e.g., dust, odour, vermin, or noise pollution).<br/>
Environmental noise and dust are generated from vehicles accessing a landfill as well as from working face operations. These impacts are best to intercept at the planning stage where access routes and landfill geometrics can be used to mitigate such issues. Vector control is also important, but can be managed reasonably well with the daily cover protocols.<br/>
Most modern landfills in industrialized countries are operated with controls to attempt manage problems such as these. Analyses of common landfill operational problems are available.<br/>
Some local authorities have found it difficult to locate new landfills. Communities may charge a fee or levy in order to discourage waste and/or recover the costs of site operations. Some landfills are operated for profit as commercial businesses. Many landfills, however, are publicly operated and funded.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><u>3.6.4 Energy Recovery:</u></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Energy recoveries from waste have two following types:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>4.6.4.1 Incineration</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Incineration is a waste treatment technology that involves the combustion of organic materials and/or substances.<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incineration#cite_note-0""><sup>[1]</sup></a> Incineration and other high temperature waste treatment systems are described as “thermal treatment”. Incineration of waste materials converts the waste into incinerator bottom ash, flue gases, particulates, and heat, which can in turn be used to generate electric power. The flue gases are cleaned of pollutants before they are dispersed in the atmosphere.<br/>
Incineration with energy recovery is one of several waste-to-energy (WtE) technologies such as gasification, Plasma arc gasification, paralysis and anaerobic digestion. Incineration may also be implemented without energy and materials recovery.<br/>
In several countries there are still expert and local community concerns about the environmental impact of incinerators (see the argument against incineration).</p>
<p>Fig: 22: Energy Recovery From Wastage<br/>
In some countries, incinerators built just a few decades ago often did not include a materials separation to remove hazardous, bulky or recyclable materials before combustion. These facilities tended to risk the health of the plant workers and the local environment due to inadequate levels of gas cleaning and combustion process control. Most of these facilities did not generate electricity.<br/>
Incinerators reduce the mass of the original waste by 80–85 % and the volume (already compressed somewhat in garbage trucks) by 95-96 %, depending upon composition and degree of recovery of materials such as metals from the ash for recycling.<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incineration#cite_note-autogenerated7-1""><sup>[2]</sup></a> This means that while incineration does not completely replace land filling, it reduces the necessary volume for disposal significantly. Garbage trucks often reduce the volume of waste in a built-in compressor before delivery to the incinerator. Alternatively, at landfills, the volume of the uncompressed garbage can be reduced by approximately 70% with the use of a stationary steel compressor, albeit with a significant energy cost. In many countries simpler waste compaction is a common practice for compaction at landfills.<br/>
Incineration has particularly strong benefits for the treatment of certain waste types in niche areas such as clinical wastes and certain hazardous wastes where pathogens and toxins can be destroyed by high temperatures. Examples include chemical multi-product plants with diverse toxic or very toxic wastewater streams, which cannot be routed to a conventional wastewater treatment plant.<br/>
Waste combustion is particularly popular in countries such as Japan where land is a scarce resource. Denmark and Sweden have been leaders in using the energy generated from incineration for more than a century, in localized combined heat and power facilities supporting district heating schemes. In 2005, waste incineration produced 4.8 % of the electricity consumption and 13.7 % of the total domestic heat consumption in Denmark. A number of other European Countries rely heavily on incineration for handling municipal waste, in particular Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany and France.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Technology</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">An incinerator is a furnace for burning waste. Modern incinerators include pollution mitigation equipment such as flue gas cleaning. There are various types of incinerator plant design: moving grate, fixed grate, rotary-kiln, fluidized bed.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Private burn pile / barrel</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The burn pile is one of the simplest and earliest forms of waste disposal, essentially consisting of a mound of combustible materials piled on bare ground and set on fire. Indiscriminate piles of household waste are strongly discouraged and may be illegal in urban areas, but are permitted in certain rural situations such as clearing forested land for farming, where the stumps are uprooted and burned. Rural burn piles of organic yard waste are also sometimes permitted, though not asphalt shingles, plastics, or other petroleum products.<br/>
Burn piles have the potential to spread uncontrolled fires, if for example wind blows burning material off the pile into surrounding combustible grasses or onto buildings. As interior structures of the pile are consumed, the pile can shift and collapse, spreading the burn area. Even in a situation of no wind, small lightweight ignited embers can lift off the pile via convection, and waft through the air into grasses or onto buildings, igniting them.<br/>
The burn barrel is a somewhat more controlled form of private waste incineration, containing the burning material inside a metal barrel, with a metal grating over the exhaust. The barrel prevents the spread of burning material in windy conditions, and as the combustibles are reduced they can only settle down into the barrel. The exhaust grating helps to prevent the spread of burning embers. Typically steel 55-gallon drums are used as burn barrels, with air vent holes cut or drilled around the base for air intake. Over time the very high heat of incineration causes the metal to oxidize and rust, and eventually the barrel itself is consumed by the heat and must be replaced.<br/>
Private burning of dry cellulose/paper products is generally clean-burning, producing no visible smoke, but the large amount of plastics in household waste can cause private burning to create a public nuisance and health hazard, generating acrid odors and fumes that make eyes burn and water. The temperatures in a burn barrel are not regulated, and usually do not reach high enough or for enough time to completely break down chemicals such as dioxin in plastics and other waste chemicals. Plastics and other petroleum products must therefore be separated and sent to commercial waste disposal facilities.<br/>
Private rural incineration is typically only permitted so long as it is not a nuisance to others, does not pose a risk of fire such as in dry conditions, and the fire is clean-burning, producing no visible smoke. People intending to burn waste may be required to contact a state agency in advance to check current fire risk and conditions, and to alert officials of the controlled fire that will occur.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Solid outputs</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Incineration produces fly ash and bottom ash just as is the case when coal is combusted. The total amount of ash produced by municipal solid waste incineration ranges from 4-10 % by volume and 15-20 % by weight of the original quantity of waste, and the fly ash amounts to about 10-20 % of the total ash. The fly ash, by far, constitutes more of a potential health hazard than does the bottom ash because the fly ash often contains high concentrations of heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, copper and zinc as well as small amounts of dioxins and furans. The bottom ashes seldom contain significant levels of heavy metals. In testing over the past decade, no ash from an incineration plant in the USA has ever been determined to be a hazardous waste. At present although some historic samples tested by the incinerator operators’ group would meet the being ecotoxic criteria at present the EA say “we have agreed” to regard incinerator bottom ash as “non-hazardous” until the testing programme is complete.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><u>3.6.4.2 Gasification</u></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Gasification</strong> is a process that converts carbonaceous materials, such as coal, petroleum, biofuel, or biomass, into carbon monoxide and hydrogen by reacting the raw material, such as house waste, or compost at high temperatures with a controlled amount of oxygen and/or steam. The resulting gas mixture is called synthesis gas or syngas and is itself a fuel. Gasification is a method for extracting energy from many different types of organic materials.<br/>
The advantage of gasification is that using the syngas is potentially more efficient than direct combustion of the original fuel because it can be combusted at higher temperatures or even in fuel cells, so that the thermodynamic upper limit to the efficiency defined by Carnot’s rule is higher or not applicable. Syngas may be burned directly in internal combustion engines, used to produce methanol and hydrogen, or converted via the Fischer-Tropsch process into synthetic fuel. Gasification can also begin with materials that are not otherwise useful fuels, such as biomass or organic waste. In addition, the high-temperature combustion refines out corrosive ash elements such as chloride and potassium, allowing clean gas production from otherwise problematic fuels.<br/>
Gasification of fossil fuels is currently widely used on industrial scales to generate electricity. However, almost any type of organic material can be used as the raw material for gasification, such as wood, biomass, or even plastic waste.<br/>
Gasification relies on chemical processes at elevated temperatures &gt;700°C, which distinguishes it from biological processes such as anaerobic digestion that produce biogas.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Chemistry</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In a gasifier, the carbonaceous material undergoes several different processes:</p>
<ol>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">The pyrolysis (or devolatilization) process occurs as the carbonaceous particle heats up. Volatiles are released and char is produced, resulting in up to 70% weight loss for coal. The process is dependent on the properties of the carbonaceous material and determines the structure and composition of the char, which will then undergo gasification reactions.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">The combustion process occurs as the volatile products and some of the char reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, which provides heat for the subsequent gasification reactions.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">The gasification process occurs as the char reacts with carbon dioxide and steam to produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen, via the reaction <img alt=""{\rm C} + {\rm H}_2 {\rm O} \rarr {\rm H}_2 + {\rm CO}"" src=""file:///C:/Users/Papon/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image048.gif"" style=""height: 32px; width: 32px;""/></li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">In addition, the reversible gas phase water gas shift reaction reaches equilibrium very fast at the temperatures in a gasifies. This balances the concentrations of carbon monoxide, steam, carbon dioxide and hydrogen.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In essence, a limited amount of oxygen or air is introduced into the reactor to allow some of the organic material to be “burned” to produce carbon monoxide and energy, which drives a second reaction that converts further organic material to hydrogen and additional carbon dioxide.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Gasification processes</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Four types of gasified are currently available for commercial use: counter-current fixed bed, co-current fixed bed, fluidized bed and entrained flow.<br/>
The counter-current fixed bed (“up draft”) gasifies consists of a fixed bed of carbonaceous fuel (e.g. coal or biomass) through which the “gasification agent” (steam, oxygen and/or air) flows in counter-current configuration. The ash is either removed dry or as a slag. The slogging gasifies have a lower ratio of steam to carbon, achieving temperatures higher than the ash fusion temperature. The nature of the gasified means that the fuel must have high mechanical strength and must ideally be non-caking so that it will form a permeable bed, although recent developments have reduced these restrictions to some extent. The throughput for this type of gasifies is relatively low. Thermal efficiency is high as the gas exit temperatures are relatively low. However, this means that tar and methane production is significant at typical operation temperatures, so product gas must be extensively cleaned before use. The tar can be recycled to the reactor.<br/>
The co-current fixed bed (“down draft”) gasifies is similar to the counter-current type, but the gasification agent gas flows in co-current configuration with the fuel (downwards, hence the name “down draft gasifies”). Heat needs to be added to the upper part of the bed, either by combusting small amounts of the fuel or from external heat sources. The produced gas leaves the gasifies at a high temperature, and most of this heat is often transferred to the gasification agent added in the top of the bed, resulting in an energy efficiency on level with the counter-current type. Since all tars must pass through a hot bed of char in this configuration, tar levels are much lower than the counter-current type.<br/>
In the fluidized bed reactor, the fuel is fluidized in oxygen and steam or air. The ash is removed dry or as heavy agglomerates that defluidize. The temperatures are relatively low in dry ash gasifies, so the fuel must be highly reactive; low-grade coals are particularly suitable. The agglomerating gasifies have slightly higher temperatures, and are suitable for higher rank coals. Fuel throughput is higher than for the fixed bed, but not as high as for the entrained flow gasifies. The conversion efficiency can be rather low due to elutriation of carbonaceous material. Recycle or subsequent combustion of solids can be used to increase conversion. Fluidized bed gasifies are most useful for fuels that form highly corrosive ash that would damage the walls of slagging gasifiers. Biomass fuels generally contain high levels of corrosive ash.<br/>
In the entrained flow gasifier a dry pulverized solid, an atomized liquid fuel or a fuel slurry is gasified with oxygen (much less frequent: air) in co-current flow. The gasification reactions take place in a dense cloud of very fine particles. Most coals are suitable for this type of gasifier because of the high operating temperatures and because the coal particles are well separated from one another. The high temperatures and pressures also mean that a higher throughput can be achieved; however thermal efficiency is somewhat lower as the gas must be cooled before it can be cleaned with existing technology. The high temperatures also mean that tar and methane are not present in the product gas; however the oxygen requirement is higher than for the other types of gasifiers. All entrained flow gasifies remove the major part of the ash as a slag as the operating temperature is well above the ash fusion temperature. A smaller fraction of the ash is produced either as a very fine dry fly ash or as black colored fly ash slurry. Some fuels, in particular certain types of biomasses, can form slag that is corrosive for ceramic inner walls that serve to protect the gasifier outer wall. However some entrained bed type of gasifies do not possess a ceramic inner wall but have an inner water or steam cooled wall covered with partially solidified slag. These types of gasifies do not suffer from corrosive slags. Some fuels have ashes with very high ash fusion temperatures. In this case mostly limestone is mixed with the fuel prior to gasification. Addition of a little limestone will usually suffice for the lowering the fusion temperatures. The fuel particles must be much smaller than for other types of gasifies. This means the fuel must be pulverized, which requires somewhat more energy than for the other types of gasifies. By far the most energy consumption related to entrained bed gasification is not the milling of the fuel but the production of oxygen used for the gasification.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Potential for renewable energy</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In principle, gasification can proceed from just about any organic material, including biomass and plastic waste. The resulting syngas can be combusted. Alternatively, if the syngas is clean enough, it may be used for power production in gas engines, gas turbines or even fuel cells, or converted efficiently to dimethyl ether (DME) by methanol dehydration, methane via the Sabatier reaction, or diesel-like synthetic fuel via the Fischer-Tropsch process. In many gasification processes most of the inorganic components of the input material, such as metals and minerals, are retained in the ash. In some gasification processes (slagging gasification) this ash has the form of a glassy solid with low leaching properties, but the net power production in slagging gasification is low (sometimes negative) and costs are higher.<br/>
Regardless of the final fuel form, gasification itself and subsequent processing neither directly emits nor traps greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide. Power consumption in the gasification and syngas conversion processes may be significant though, and may indirectly cause CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; in slagging and plasma gasification, the electricity consumption may even exceed any power production from the syngas. Combustion of syngas or derived fuels emits the exact same amount of carbon dioxide as would have been emitted from direct combustion of the initial fuel. Biomass gasification and combustion could play a significant role in a renewable energy economy, because biomass production removes the same amount of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere as is emitted from gasification and combustion. While other bio fuel technologies such as biogas and biodiesel are carbon neutral, gasification in principle may run on a wider variety of input materials and can be used to produce a wider variety of output fuels.<br/>
There is at present very little industrial scale biomass gasification being done. Examples of demonstration projects include those of the Renewable Energy Network Austria, including a plant using dual fluidized bed gasification that has supplied the town of Güssing with 2 MW of electricity and 4 MW of heat, generated from wood chips, since 2003.</p>
<p><strong><u>3.12 Footwear</u></strong><strong><u> Wastage Management in Bangladesh</u></strong></p>
<p>Though proper wastage management in appeared to be economical for any industrial production, practice is not been so familiar in footwear industries in Bangladesh. Only a few leading companies introduced this approach for some of their production facilities.</p>
<p>Wastage and disposal methods</p>
<p><strong>Leather Materials:</strong> wastage from shoe production often reused in sandal manufacturing where small pieces are required than shoe. Small pieces are also used to produce leather goods (key ring).</p>
<p><strong>Paper: </strong>thin paper disposals are often used as filler between insole and outsole. For this they are cut in to small pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Synthetic materials: </strong>paper industries take charge of these disposals which includes different fabrics and fabrics materials, foam, threads, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Cutting dice and sole moulds: </strong>These are made from aluminum alloy, so they are melting to reproduce those parts.</p>
<p><strong>Last: </strong>damaged PU lasts can’t be used to produce new lasts as they result in low durability. So they used in production of other PU products.</p>
<p><strong>PU sole:</strong> they are reused as soling material in injection moulded shoes.</p>
<p><strong>TPR</strong><strong> sole: </strong>these are cut into small granules and mixed with fresh granules in a ratio of 80:20 to produce TPR soles.<br/>
Moreover, some companies sales their rejected shoes in comparatively low price.</p>
<p><strong><u>Establishing Nationwide Footwear Recycling in the UK</u></strong></p>
<p>Short-term recovery solutions based on readily available technologies and processes are required to deal with the waste generated as a result of 338 million pairs of shoes sold within the UK each year. The availability of fashionable and affordable shoes has led to a fundamental change in attitudes towards shoe purchasing, with shoe retailers enjoying a sustained period of growth in recent years (a 34% increase in consumer spending between2001-200515).<br/>
The following subsections present the workshop group discussion relating to the current post-consumer shoe recycling activities available within the UK, and the need to identify the best short-term solutions to deal with the waste currently produced.<br/>
• Established method (municipal incineration plants, co-combustion in rotary/cement kilns etc.)<br/>
• High calorific value of leather<br/>
• Harmful air emissions<br/>
• Low public acceptance in the UK<br/>
• Applicable to a variety of waste types<br/>
• No harmful air emission released<br/>
• Expensive technology (approximately £165/tone)<br/>
• Not proven for post-consumer shoe waste<br/>
5.1 Current solutions for recycling of footwear products the participants were asked as to their knowledge of other existing shoe recycling activities besides those summarized in Section 4 of this paper, but were not aware of any additional solutions. This was followed by consideration of the various types of footwear waste produced within the industry which were summarized as; post-consumer, over-production, samples, returns, defects and odd size pairings. It was highlighted that currently shoe reuse is the most widely adopted recovery approach within the UK, with well established infrastructures to support reverse logistics. The <strong>Textile Recycling Association </strong>indicated the exact figures regarding the scale of shoe exportation from the UK were unclear, because whilst there is a specific export code for used clothing there is not one for used shoes/footwear. The estimated figure of 26,244 tones (see Section2) was considered by the group to be an optimistic estimate for the scale of current collection and reuse activities within the UK. Furthermore, concerns were voiced as to the long-term sustainability of exporting second-hand shoes for reuse as an end-of-life processing option due to previously mentioned environmental and economical impacts in developing countries. Shoe recycling technologies have had limited success within the UK. The majority of established leather recycling businesses is focused at the waste produced within the shoe manufacturing process. <strong>E-Leather </strong>stated that recycling of leather is currently restricted town-finished manufacturing waste, citing the increased frictional effects of finished leather as the main barrier for the processing of post-consumer shoes. The only other post-consumer example of shoe recycling is through the Nike’s ‘Reuse-A-Shoe’ program, which utilizes granulated rubber recovered from athletic shoes to produce sports surfaces and running tracks. <strong>Nike </strong>noted that the extension of this crumbing approach to other leather-based shoes is currently questionable due to the lack of established markets for such recycled materials. <strong>Playtop </strong>also highlighted that the use of current Nike Grind material is limited to 35% of their sport surfaces as the size of the granulate make it impossible for the material to be used in many of their products. In addition, <strong>Playtop </strong>stated that the typical life of these sports surfaces are around 20 years, and the company is currently investigating the recycling potential of their surfacing material after this period. Incineration is currently adopted in some local authorities to process municipal solid waste, and therefore it can be assumed that certain quantities of post-consumer shoe waste is indirectly processed via this method. However, the viability of the adoption of this technique to deal with the large quantities of footwear waste was questioned by the participants. Although, the high calorific value of leather waste (18.3 MJ/Kg)16 makes it suitable for use within energy recovery technology, questions regarding the safety of emissions produced during the shoe combustion process (e.g. the quantities of Chromium 6 and Polyvinylchloride) would need further investigation. <strong>Pentland </strong>suggested strong evidence would be required as to the environmental benefits of this approach before such an end-of-life strategy were publicly endorsed.<br/>
5.2 Economic implications of post-consumer shoe collection and recycling The establishment of a collection infrastructure and recycling facilities to process the quantities of footwear waste currently produced within the UK will have serious economic ramifications. Two models for funding mechanisms were discussed by the group and are summarized below:</p>
<p><strong>i. Environmental levies at point of sale: </strong>This would be added directly to the recommended retail price (RRP) and would be similar to the textile ‘eco-tax’ introduced in France earlier this year, which charges 0.05 €/kg on new leather and shoes products to cover the costs of reuse and recycling. <strong>George Clothing </strong>raised the question as to the amount of this levy and its potential impact to the cost of certain shoe types that already had tight margins of profit (e.g. cheap mass produced consumer footwear). An alternative approach was highlighted by <strong>E-Leather </strong>and <strong>Soletech Systems </strong>to incentivize shoe returns via a tax rebate in the form of cash or club card credit.</p>
<p><strong>ii. Take-back levies from manufacturers: </strong>This would be a system similar to that adopted within the packaging and electronics recycling sector, whereby quantities of ‘shoe recovery notes’ would be purchased by manufacturers from recyclers based on their market share. The funds collected through shoe recovery notes would then be used to pay for the take-back and recycling of shoes. Regarding the possible methods to establishing the reverse logistics for increased shoe recycling, the group identified three possible scenarios:<br/>
<strong>a. </strong>An increased quantity of recycler collection banks at retail parks and recycling points.<br/>
<strong>b. </strong>Return facilities at all shoe retailing outlets.<br/>
<strong>c. </strong>Local authority collection via the use of shoe recycling bags.</p>
<p><strong>British Footwear Association </strong>argued that a significant expansion of existing recovery capacity might not necessarily result in an increase in the amount of shoes collected. Instead consumer awareness and apathy were cited as the main barriers for the extension of existing shoe collection activities. Hence, concerns were raised regarding the effectiveness of the first two approaches based on current post-consumer recycling trends. <strong>Nike </strong>highlighted the need for the shoe returning exercise to be made more convenient, expressing a view that consumers may be reluctant to carry their old shoes while shopping. <strong>European Recycling Company </strong>suggested that if consumers were made aware of the positions of shoe recycling banks, this approach may still provide the most convenient collection method. The requirement for substantial investment in infrastructure, public awareness and recycling technologies was strongly voiced by all. <strong>Environment Agency </strong>stated that questions regarding the financial viability of some of the more fringe recycling technologies will become clearer in the coming years as the technology becomes; cheaper, more established and financially comparable with the cost of land filling.</p>
<p>5.3 Long-term solutions and technology gaps<br/>
There was a united consensus on the need for additional investigation as to the environmental and economic ramifications of the current and future footwear recycling activities within the UK. <strong>Textile Recycling Association</strong>, <strong>Pentland </strong>and <strong>Terra Plan </strong>suggested that any further investigation should begin with a carbon-footprint analysis of the current footwear recycling options (i.e. reconditioning, reuse, recycling and energy recovery),accompanied by the analysis of £/tone end-of-life processing cost to provide a suitable comparison with escalating landfill prices. Furthermore, due to the multi-material composition of current footwear, <strong>British Footwear Association </strong>and <strong>George Clothing </strong>stressed the need to diversify this analysis to include all footwear types and not only leather-based shoes.<br/>
<strong>Pentland </strong>and <strong>Next </strong>pointed out the advantages of gasification over incineration, in particular in cases where re-use or recycling are not viable options and highlighted the need for further investigation in gasification technology. Additional areas of research identified by the group<br/>
included:</p>
<p>i. The need to understand the environmental impacts of the shoe manufacturing processes as well as its end-of-life recovery.<br/>
ii. The exploration of a ‘design for recycling’ approach for footwear products to improve the economic viability of post-consumer recovery.</p>
<p>iii. The creation of automated disassembly technologies to assist in the segregation of different material types to generate useful and marketable end-of-life materials.</p>
<p>iv. The investigation of a number of business models within the footwear recycling sector to suggest the best ways to exploit a nationwide shoe recycling scheme within the UK.</p>
<p>5.4 Immediate actions required to set up footwear recycling scheme to raise the profile of post-consumer shoe recycling and to deal with the abundance of footwear waste currently produced within the UK, the discussion moved towards the steps required to establish a nationwide footwear recycling scheme. The intended aim was to determine a group consensus as to the short-term actions required to implement shoe recycling, using current technology and markets.</p>
<p>The group stressed the role that Government and local authorities needed to play in this activity and the use of the national waste management infrastructure currently in place (i.e. curb-side collection). Barriers highlighted by the group regarding the engagement of these two stakeholders within a national footwear recycling scheme were identified as the lack of detailed understanding of the environmental benefits of footwear recycling, and the varying waste management priorities of local authorities across the country. It was suggested that a detailed carbon-footprint analysis of current end-of-life footwear options could provide the catalyst for more comprehensive Governmental support, but doubts were raised as to the cooperation of local authorities due to the large number of other recycling campaigns<br/>
currently vying for their attention and support (i.e. batteries, clothing, glass, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Tesco </strong>and <strong>Next </strong>cited the similarities between the implementation issues discussed within the workshop and those mentioned for post-consumer textile recycling. A specific reference was made to the “sustainable clothing roadmap” initiative led by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to provide strategic direction for sustainable consumption and production within the clothing sector17. It was suggested that this initiative would provide a suitable forum for further discussion of footwear recycling issues. Consequently, a meeting with Dr Dorothy Maxwell, the clothing roadmap lead within the Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) programme was held on the 3rd December2007 in London. The purpose of the meeting was to compare the aims of the sustainability clothing roadmap with those of the remit of the workshop on footwear recycling. It became apparent from this meeting that the scope of the ‘sustainable clothing roadmap’ is extremely comprehensive, focusing not only on the environmental impacts of clothing but also on the social and ethical issues relating to their production. The ‘sustainable clothing roadmap’ is intended to take a whole life-cycle view of textile consumption, and considers the impacts of upstream supply and production right the way through to in-use maintenance and end-of-life disposal. A brief summary of discussions in this meeting is included in Appendix IV. The main results from the meeting was that Defray is very keen to facilitate the sharing of information and knowledge among the stakeholders in the clothing and footwear sectors, but is unable to extend the scope of the ‘sustainable clothing roadmap’ program to include the considerations of footwear products at this present time.</p>

<strong>Procedures</strong><br/>
The steps shall be the following:<br/>
-Waste quantification: calculate the quantity of the wastes generated during the test period (following the List presented in Table 4). For each waste, calculate the ratio quantity/number of pairs produced during the test period in kg/1000 pairs.</p>
<p>– Determine the average mass of the pair of shoe which is representative of the specified final product, group of final products or the whole production being analyzed during the test period.</p>
<p>– Use of waste management practices: for each waste, calculate the part treated according to each waste Management practices given in Table 5. Fill the table like Table 4.</p>
<p>– Provide the results: if practices coded «B», «D» or «G» are used, specify in technical terms which Practice is followed.</p>
<p><strong>Calculation methods</strong><br/>
<strong>Waste quantity </strong><br/>
The wastes included are those generated when producing a defined part of the production of a factory. For example, it can be one type of shoe, one production technology or it could be the whole production. All waste quantities, even liquid wastes, are converted into kilograms. Then the ratio «kg of waste/1000 pairs shall be calculated. The test period shall be maximum 12 months.</p>
<p><strong>Use of waste management practices</strong><br/>
During the test period, it is possible that parts of each waste will be managed according to different practices.<br/>
For each waste, calculate the part treated according to each practice listed in Table 5. If there is no documented information on how the waste was treated (except for Reuse), the chosen practice shall be</p>

<p><strong><u>4.1 Environmental Effect of Footwear Industries Wastages  </u></strong></p>
<p>There are many environmental pollution problems linked with the footwear industry. These occur both in the production of raw materials and with the footwear manufacture it. However, until recently the only major environmental concerns for the producers have been the use of hazardous materials and chemicals in 497 shoes, and the air, water and solid waste emissions generated during the shoe production process. In fact, the most serious risks to the environment are to be found with suppliers of semi-finished products and components such as leather, which is produced by tanning. Especially, the use of chromium as tanning agent, which is highly toxic and a suspected carcinogen, has been a major environmental issue for the footwear industry over the last few decades. The use of PVC also, has been reduced in the footwear manufacturing sector because it is claimed that when burned at low temperatures, it has the potential to form organo-chlorine substances, which are extremely toxic both for the environment and for human beings.</p>
<p><strong>Table: 7: Major Pollutants in Footwear Industry</strong><br/>
Finally, solvents and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs), used in synthetic upper materials, leather finishing, adhesives and cleaners, are of major importance for the footwear industry since they contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone, an air pollutant harmful to human health as well as plant life. Table 1 presents some if the major pollutants that linked with footwear materials and their processes. In order to promote footwear products which have lower environmental impacts, the European Union (EU) recently has established the European Footwear Eco-Label scheme as a marketing and publicity tool for environmental-friendly shoes [8]. To be able to use the footwear eco-label some determined ecological criteria must be fulfilled. These criteria aim, in particular, at limiting the levels of toxic residues, limiting the emissions of VOCs and promoting a more durable footwear product. However, the major environmental challenge that footwear industry is currently facing, is the enormous amount of waste generated at the end-of-life phase. Some 12 billion pairs of shoes produced worldwide every year, with most of them being disposed in landfills. Landfill sites can result in serious environmental pollution of groundwater and rivers, due to landfill leachate. Landfill space is also becoming extremely limited, especially in some European countries where available landfill space is non-existent. Finally, forthcoming product-related environmental legislation is expected to change the approach of the footwear industry regarding its EoL waste.</p>
<p>In most countries, managing EoL waste has long been and, in most cases, still is the responsibility of governmental agencies and local authorities. Once products reach the end of their functional lives, producers play no role in collection, recycling or disposal of those EoL products. This approach has started to change with the emergence of a producer responsibility concept. This concept was first introduced in Germany with the 1991 Packaging Ordinance which required manufacturers and distributors to take back packaging from consumers and ensured that a specified percentage is recycled. Producer responsibility legislation was introduced into the EU waste policy with the 1994 Packaging Directive and since then has spread to most industrialized countries. In 2000, the European Commission passed a Directive requiring its Member States to institute a producer responsibility program for end-of-life vehicles (ELV) while an additional Directive for Waste Electronics and Electrical Equipment (WEEE) is expected to be adopted soon by all EU Member States. This concept of broadening manufacturer’s responsibility for products beyond their useful life into the post-consumer phase, also concerns closing the loop with respect to materials use and waste management at the end-of-life phase, while providing a source of financing to offset the cost disadvantage of recycling versus disposal and energy recovery. In this context, take-back and producer responsibility legislation is expected to affect the footwear sector similarly to what has happen in other consumer product sectors, e.g. with the implementation of the ELV and WEEE Directives.</p>
<p><strong>4.2 Future Disposal System of Shoe Upper Leather</strong><br/>
Effective management of EoL waste is a rather complex issue made up of many components. Although there is no blueprint that can be applied in every industrial sector, the European Commission has set up a waste hierarchy framework which specifies the order in which waste management options should be considered, based on environmental impact. Based on this hierarchy, an integrated waste management framework for footwear products has been developed and presented in Figure1. This proposed framework divides the waste management options for shoes into two major approaches: proactive and reactive. Proactive approaches include all measures that are taken with the aim to reduce or minimize waste at the source. Reduction of waste, also referred to as waste minimization, is a proactive approach because simply, waste which is avoided needs no management and has no environmental impact. On the other hand, reactive approaches include all the other waste management options which act in response to the waste problem when the useful life of the product has ended. Reactive waste management approach is also referred as End-of-Life Management. The key difference<br/>
Between  proactive and reactive approaches is timing. EoL management is an after-the event approach while proactive approaches have an “anticipate and prevent” philosophy to deal with waste.</p>
<p>In general, it makes far more sense to reduce or even minimize waste than to develop extensive treatment schemes and techniques to ensure that the waste poses no threat to the environment. Waste minimization activities range from product and material changes, to process changes, to changes in methods of operations. Although there is a wide range of proactive waste management activities, there are two major improvement methods that could be applied in the footwear industry in order to reduce or even minimize waste at the source, Waste minimization strategies should start at the beginning of a product’s life cycle, here in the product design phase using eco-design improvements. Ecodesign improvements in the footwear sector could have significant impact on environmental quality and could reduce the amount of materials needed, thus reducing the amount of waste that need to be handled at the end of the lifecycle. Also a footwear product which is designed for ease of disassembly will make reuse and recycling of its components and parts easier, thus reducing the amount of materials disposed into landfill.</p>

<p><strong><u>Chapter Five</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>5.1 Findings &amp; Observations </strong><br/>
Forthcoming legislative requirements and market pressures are expected to force the footwear industry towards measures to deal with its end-of-life waste. Recycling and product recovery activities for footwear products need to be identified to ensure that land filling is reduced and hazardous substances do not enter the environment or impact on human health while the economic value of the end-of-life materials, components and products is recovered. Proactive waste management activities such as material substitution will not, in the short term, be able to solve the issues connected to current EoL waste generation. This highlights the need to direct considerable efforts on reactive end of life management initiatives improving the treatment of waste currently generated, especially those focusing on the encouragement of reuse, recycling and energy recovery of footwear products. In this context, this paper presented an integrated waste management framework for the footwear industry based on proactive and reactive waste management options, the composition of which is determined by the availability of end-of-life shoes and by access to recycling facilities.</p>
<p><strong>5.2 Limitations</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Footwear industry is a rising sector in Bangladesh. It requires a big scale research to find all the aspects of waste management for this sector. But the time limitation for this project work is not sufficient.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Industries are not willing to reveal their waste management policy for their business purpose.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">We cover up all the theoretical aspects of the project work but can’t implement them in practical due to time constrains.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">As the topics is a new one, there is no past project work documentation is available to guide my project.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
<em><strong>5.3 Recommendations </strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><em>Environment should be at top of all wastage management practice.</em></li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><em>Proper wastage management facilities should be introduced in all footwear industries in Bangladesh.</em></li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><em>Government should take proper wastage management initiatives to facilitate the practice.</em></li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><em>Small leather goods manufacturers have to come forward to utilize the large amount of leather disposals produced in footwear industries.</em></li>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>A WEB BASED ONLINE SHOP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Abstract:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Internet marketing</b>, also referred to as <b>I-marketing</b>, <b>web-marketing</b>, <b>online-marketing</b>, <b>Search Engine Marketing (SEM)</b> or <b>e-Marketing</b>, is the marketing of products or services over the Internet. At present time, Internet marketing plays a big roll in our life. The goal of an e-commerce site is not only to sell goods but also to provide services through online.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This project deals with developing an online shopping website for online products sale. It provides the user with a catalog of different products available for purchase in the store. Our system is implemented using a 3-tier approach, a backend database, a middle tier of Apache and php, and a web browser as the front-end client. In order to develop an e-commerce website, a number of technologies must be studied and understood. These include multi-tiered architecture, server and client side scripting techniques, implementation technologies such as, programming language, relational databases (such as MySQL). Objective of this project is to develop a basic website where we used a database system for storing all information rather than file system. Administrator will be able to create new categories, add products, add user, update order status, enable/disable user from the system and user has the access buy to their different types of products. User can pay the payment by Paypal or “Cash on Delivery”. Website visitor only has the access to visit the website and they can have all the information from the site.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>1.1 Introduction</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Online system revolutionary changes in our day to day life as well as peoples depend on it because it brings more flexibility in our life. Online shopping is one of them, where one can buy and sell everything from his/her house within a few times. So, no need to go anywhere and one can choose the best product from a reasonable price and easily sell allowance for his product. That’s why, Online shopping day by day more popular in our busy life. We observed and analyzed this present situation and selected a project topic and made it based on Online Shopping Management System.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>1.2 Objectives of the Project</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Online Shop management system provides product information and selling to Seller, Buyer and Visitor. The goal of this report are given below</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">§ To Learn Internet Marketing Plans.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">§ Give a general idea of the proposed web development model.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">§ Propose modifications and addition of certain features of the web site.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">§ Getting idea about web-related research.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">§ Getting Knowledge about E-commerce.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">§ Getting Knowledge about the programming.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">§ Get an overall idea of designing the relevant database.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">§ To Learn about software tools.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">§ Get a broad discussion of the proposed and implemented features of the whole program.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">§ Analyze the security measurement of the web site.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">§ To learn payment security systems.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>1.3 Research Methodology</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There is concerned with the methodological problem of how to integrate qualitative and quantitative insights in developing an agent-based model of the ecommerce case study.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>1.3.1 Procedure</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In this project Linear Sequential Model or Waterfall model has been used for development. The linear sequential model suggests a systematic, sequential approach to software development that begins at the system level and progresses through analysis, design, coding, testing, and support. The linear sequential model is the oldest and the most widely used paradigm for software engineering. As we had developed this project in a conventional way and all the requirements were taken at a time for analysis, for this reason Waterfall Model was chosen for to use in our project.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>1.3.2 Techniques </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In the time of e-shopping having an ecommerce website has become a common thing. Most of the E-commerce systems techniques are almost similar. As a result, the similar techniques are used in the context of project development. Extra additional techniques are used by someone to develop the popularity of websites. This main product-selling-system is almost same for all website. For this reason, we have developed our project by using this customized technique. Before using this technique we have studied it very minutely and have completed our project by followings all standard system of online shopping.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>1.3.3 Tools</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Designs tools are very important to develop any software and without these tools it is not possible to develop any software. These tools are related to each other very closely. We have used these tools PHP, Mysql, JavaScript, CSS, HTML and XHTML to develop our software which is briefly mentioned below:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· <b>PHP: </b>PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for the Web. Within an HTML page; user can embed PHP code that will be executed each time the page is visited.The user PHP code is interpreted at the web server and generates HTML or other output that the visitor will see. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page but was changed in line with the GNU recursive naming convention (GNU = Gnu’s Not Unix) and now stands for PHP Hypertext Preprocessor.</p>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li><b>Mysql: </b>MySQL is a open source Relational Database Management System. MySQL is very fast reliable and Flexible Database Management System. It provides a very high performance and it is multi threaded and multi user Relational Database Management System.</li>
<li><b>Javascript: </b>Javascript is a programming language that is used to make web pages interactive. It runs on user visitor’s computer and so does not require constant downloads from the user web site. It is a scripting language.</li>
<li><b>CSS: </b>CSS is an abbreviation for Cascading Style Sheets. Style sheets are a very powerful tool for the Web site developer. They give to user the chance to be completely consistent with the look and feel of user pages, while giving the user much more control over the layout and design than straight HTML ever did.</li>
<li><b>HTML: </b>Hyper Text Mark language” is used to write web pages, combining plain text and special tags that tell a browser how to treat that text. We use HTML to describe how element in a web page should be displayed, how pages should be linked, where to put images, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>1.3.4 Documentation Aids</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This document helps in understanding the creation of an interactive web page and the technologies used to implement it. The design of the project which includes Data Model and Process Model illustrates how the database is built with different tables, how the data is accessed and processed from the tables. The building of the project has given us a precise knowledge about how php is used to develop a website, how it connects to the database to access the data and how the data and web pages are modified.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>1.3.5 Project Assumptions and Potential Risks</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Assumptions: </b>Te project is a web application. A web application has to be tested and implemented in web server and web browsers intensively. Apart from functional requirements there are non-functional and pseudo requirements have to be met. The User Interface has to be user friendly and attractive enough to fulfill user expectations.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Potential risks: </b>This is a group project of two team members. There are some potential risks like software delivery on time, project collaboration project reports write up etc.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>1.4 Project Development </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We have studied the subject matters of the project in respect of developing our selected project. As a result we have drawn the project development flowchart which is shown as below:</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>1.5 Duration of Work</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) is an algorithmic software cost estimation model developed by Barry Boehm. The model uses a basic regression formula, with parameters that are derived from historical project data and current project characteristics. We have used COCOMO model to estimate our project. As two people was in this project, we will express our total estimation in man-hour.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Total line of Code: 20 k</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Total man-hour: 462 hours</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Total resource: 2</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>1.6 Organization of the Book</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This report is organized in seven chapters which reflect various topics related to the features of used project tools, designing database, implementation and security issues.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">First chapter introduces the overall work and it states the motivation behind this exertion mentions the objectives of this report and specifies related context and issues. The rest of the report is organized as follows.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Chapter 2 describes about Existing System and Requirement Elicitation. In Chapter 3, the proposed system has been covered and deals with database design. The designing phase, E-R model, functions definition have been discussed in this chapter. And the total database that has been used in this project is also being described here. Chapter 4 discussed about the Web Engineering as well as its need and characteristics. We introduce our project Simulation, Implementation, Integration &amp; Maintenance in Chapter 5. The next chapter, Chapter 6, describes about the application design. Finally Chapter 7 concludes the report and outlines the future work. Future work suggests the enhancement of this project in terms of including more features in the actual web site.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.5 Requirement Analysis</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Various type of system contains different facilities and limitations. After studying the process, feature and limitation of some online shopping web site. Now that’s why we need some requirements. These are given below:</p>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li>Web design must be fixed in all browsers well.</li>
<li>Discount coupon code must be added.</li>
<li>Product options like color, size etc must be added.</li>
<li>It is very necessary to add user interface.</li>
<li>More improvement need in customer service.</li>
<li>Site link should be well constructed.</li>
<li>Better loading system must be added in site loading issue.</li>
<li>Site activity measurement must be need for better service.</li>
<li>How to order information page should be add because its help for a new customer.</li>
<li>SEO must be added</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">§ SSL technology must be required for security.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>2.6 Conclusion</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As a matter of fact neither of the above discussed models and approaches have been thoroughly followed to the development work of this related field. In the next chapter, there will be discussion on proposed system which is related to the combination of approaches discussed above.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>The Proposed System</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>3.1 Introduction</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Since the development of the Internet many things that were pretty hard to obtain or to do, like information on a large variety of topics or communication with distant friends have become so simple that anyone can have access to them just by using a computer.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Among the many advantages that the Internet gives us, one of the main ones is online shopping, an activity that many have become addicted to. Shopping is a necessity for all of us, some of us really enjoys it, and others try to keep it as simple and short as possible. Well, online shopping is the best solution for both those who consider it a chore that they try to avoid and for those who do it on a daily basis. This chapter deals with the discussion of the proposed system.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>3.2 System Overview </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After the user browse around user will see that the basic flow of our shop is:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• A customer visit the site</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Customer browse the pages, clicking her way between categories</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• View the product details that she found interesting</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Add products to shopping cart.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Need login if customer has to not log in.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Checkout ( entering the shipping address, payment info )</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Thank you page and go to payapal for payment.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The customer does need to register for an account. Customer can not buy without login.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>3.3 System Methods </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We have explored that our system is the best system or updated system. We have followed the below methods:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· We have fully done our system by using php programming language and mysql. But it would be very diffcult for customization if we use other frameworks like Joomla, Magento, WordPress, Opencart etc.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· We have used XHTML/CSS for form design.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· We have used our website font standard size.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· We have used Jquery javascript library for form validation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Our website compatibility with all browsers like.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· We have made the User Interface(UI) of the site very simply as it were users can find out very easily.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Our site is comparatively fast than any other sites because we didn’t add any extra function more than what is necessary.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· All of the links in our site is very user friendly.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Anyone can easily find our website.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Category à Sub category à Product thus we have created the category and product sections in to our system.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· We have explored the Search Engine Optimization (SEO) by using the web admin tools; as a result, this site shows in the first page of the google search page.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· We used google analytic tools.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· We have added some extra pages in this site for which members can know how to order and so on.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Our customer service option too much high.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Customer can enjoy the convenience of shopping at any hour and anywhere in the world.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">· Product delivery system is faster then any other site. The orders which are based on cash on delivery will be delivered quickly. And the orders which are based on paypal payment will be activated the delivery process after payment immediately.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>3.4 Features of the Proposed System</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">On proposed system we relate to the combination of User-Centered Design and with existing approach. And also to overcome the facets of user experience our proposal is on the model of user-experienced honeycomb. It is based on the qualities:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Fig 3.1:</b> User experienced honeycomb</p>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li><b>Useful: </b>One must have the courage and creativity to ask whether the products and systems are useful, and to apply the deep knowledge of craft and medium to define innovative solutions that are more useful.</li>
<li><b>Usable: </b>Ease of use remains vital, and yet the interface-centered methods and perspectives of human-computer interaction do not address all dimensions of web design. In short, usability is necessary but not sufficient.</li>
<li><b>Desirable: </b>The quest for efficiency must be tempered by an appreciation for the power and value of image, identity, brand, and other elements of emotional design.</li>
<li><b>Findable: </b>One must strive to design navigable web sites and locatable objects, so users can find what they need.</li>
<li><b>Credible: </b>The beginning to understand the design elements that influence whether users trust and believe what we tell them.</li>
<li><b>Valuable: </b>The sites must deliver value to our sponsors. For non-profits, the user experience must advance the mission. With for-profits, it must contribute to the bottom line and improve customer satisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>3.5 Usability of the Proposed System</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The following principle is important for the success of a web site.</p>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li><b>Make it unique </b>– One often compare building web sites to building homes, and I look at myself as a custom home builder.</li>
<li><b>Keep it simple </b>– One firmly believe in keeping a web site simple, both from an aesthetic point of view, and more importantly, from an engineering point of view. Aesthetically, the user to be able to see the message and be able to act on it. No need for flashing text or cheesy animations. For reliability, cost, and search engine issues, one try to keep as much of the site in plain HTML. This makes the site easier to index, quicker to load, and easier to bookmark.</li>
<li><b>Make it easy to navigate </b>– This is probably the most import item on this list because once users find a site, they need to quickly find the information they’re after or they will be returning to the search engine to click on the competitor’s site. Many of existing sites use a left hand menu that has become sort of a standard in web site design. This immediately lets the visitor see what the main topics are, and they can easily jump from section to section on any page of the site. They don’t have to remember the trail that got them to where they are and they don’t have to make return trips to the home page.</li>
<li><b>Make it easy to bookmark </b>– Once users find what they are looking for, they often want to bookmark it so that they can return to that point later. By avoiding frames and dynamic pages, the site guarantee that when a user bookmarks a page in the site, they will be returned to the exact page that they bookmarked. This is also very important if people want to create links to the user content rather than just the home page.</li>
<li><b>Make it easy to expand </b>– Publishing on the web is one of the most cost effective ways to get information to the potential and existing users. Because of this one often find that a client will start with a five page site and once they see how well it is working they want to add more to it. The design is used to make it easy to expand the site without having to tear it apart and start over. This is one reason left hand navigation model is favorable.</li>
<li><b>Code by hand </b>– Coming from a programming background, coding HTML by hand was a natural way to do it. Also being a programmer, one have the discipline to create very efficient coding which makes for more stable pages that download quicker.</li>
<li><b>Make it compatible </b>– One have to really aware of how many web sites are built that aren’t compatible. Part of the compatibility issue is also making sure the design is flexible. The designer has to realize that on the web there is no control over how the work will be viewed. Monitor size, choice of browser, choice of default fonts and many other issues all affect how the page will render. A good design must be flexible so that it displays well for a broad range of users. It may not be perfect for everyone, but it should be readable. The examples shown below illustrate how this page looks at the same resolution on a Macintosh running Mozilla (left) and on a PC running Internet Explorer 6(right).</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>3.6 Proposed System</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After requirement analysis and constructing design phase the content of the site arranged as:</p>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li><b>Home Page: </b>This is where the customers will go. They will browse around and view the products and hopefully if they’re interested enough they’ll put some products in the cart.</li>
<li><b>Category Page: </b>Just to add some navigation so the customer can browse around.</li>
<li><b>Product Page</b>:Display detailed information about a product.</li>
<li><b>Add to Cart Page: </b>All interesting goodies go here.</li>
<li><b>View Cart Page: </b>Customer can view what’s in her shopping cart. Probably modifying the product quantity or dump some products (or even abandon the whole cart).</li>
<li><b>Checkout Page: </b>There are three steps to complete the checkout
<ul>
<li>Fill out the shipping and payment info</li>
<li>Confirm the ordered items, shipping and payment info and enter the payment method.</li>
<li>Save the order information to the database. If the payment method is COD (cash on delivery) go straight to the thank you page. If the customer chooses to pay with paypal submit the payment info to paypal server.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Register: </b>In this page the registration form has been given for the user to register and get the extra facilities from the web sites.</li>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Database is implemented in MySQL Database Management System (DBMS). This project is medium software. Most of its interface is done with PHP files.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Fig 3.5 : </b>ER Diagram for Shopping site</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Form Design</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>4.1 Introduction</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Form design is very important for this project. After completing database design we have planned for form design. Firstly for this design we have been used photoshop. Here we have been used layer, color and decide how will be our page looks like. The first page or Home Page of any website is the gateway page from where internet users take decision to go further for visit site or not. Home Page is considered as most important and essential page in website. Web designers / graphic designers spend lots of time in preparing home page. Many web design companies spend lots of money for giving exclusive look to their home page in compare to their competitor’s website. Even small companies have also started to pay more attention in design of their home page. Attractive and informative home page will build any company’s strong impression. So we have been taken a decision and design our pages. Here we will now describe how many pages we designed; we will show how they are looks like and which page containing what information.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>4.2 Detailed Front-end Logical Design of the Proposed System</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>4.2.1 Shop: The Main Page</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Following picture is the home page (front page). There are five main parts here. Those parts are: header part, Navigation part, Banner part, Container part and Footer part. At the very top and bottom have the common header and footer. Header part contains logo. Search option for searching any products. Shopping cart portion show how many products we add to my cart.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Navigation part contains some menu link for going those pages and the banner part contains some product galleries image.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Fig 4.1:</b> Home page layout</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Container part contains three columns. Left column has the category browser module. The shopper can click here way through categories to find the product. And also have a login form. User can login their account by putting username and password. The right side is where we put the <strong>mini shopping cart module.</strong> If the visitor adds a product, this mini cart will show the item. And also have a featured product module. User can see the featured product item in here.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Middle part is the main body for this project. For all action middle part will be changed according to its action. Here we show the product categories and products. The visitor will (hopefully) find her way through the shop, find the item she want, put it into the shopping cart and then buy.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">What we show in the main area depends on the visitor action. When user first time arrives to main page user get the category list. If the user clicks on one of the category then we show the product list for that category. And if the user clicks on a product from the list we show the product detail. The bottom area is used for displaying the store information (copyright, address, email, phone number).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>4.2.2 Shop: Browse Category</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">On the left side of the shop pages we show the category list. When the customer clicks on a category on the left side customer can see all products in that category. The shop main page include this navigation from <b>include/leftNav.php</b> and as mentioned before, the one responsible to get the list of categories for this navigation is the <b>formatCategories()</b> function in <b>library/category-functions.php</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In summary here is what <b>formatCategories() </b>do :</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">1. Get all the children categories</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">2. Get the parent category and other categories on the same level as the parent</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">3. Keep looping to get the parent’s parent until we reach the top level category</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Fig 4.2 :</b> Categories List</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>4.2.3 Shop: View Product List</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When the user click one of the categories from the left navigation the main content area will show all product contained in that category. For example if the user click on <b>Laptop</b> then all products in this category will be shown. Actually “Laptop” doesn’t have any product. Those products are belonging to its children categories (Asus and Dell).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Fig 4.3:</b> Product List</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>4.2.4 Shop: View Product Details</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When the user clicks on any one of the product from the product list, the product detail page will show up and for each product the software will display the full-sized image, name, details, price and ‘Add to cart’ button.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Here is the snapshot of the product detail page. We have full size image on top left corner, the description at the bottom, then the product name, price and an ‘Add To Cart’ button on the right.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There’s one more important thing about the ‘Add To Cart’ button. We only show this if we still have this product in stock. After we run out of this product we just display ‘Out Of Stock’.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Fig 4.4:</b> Product Details Page</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>4.2.5 Shop: Cart Page</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If a registered user click on the ‘Add To Cart’ button on the product detail page or latest product module or featured product module one will be redirected to the shopping cart page ( cart.php ). For example if any one want to buy “Dell Inspiron 11z” then he or she will need to go: cart.php?action=add&amp;p=19.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Here is the list of product which is carted. Now if there are already items in the cart we have presented it to the customer like shown below. Each row shows the product thumbnail name, unit price, quantity and sub total. On each row we have a delete button so the customer can easily remove the item from cart.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Since we have “action=add” in the query string the addToCart() function will be called. In short the function will do these:</p>
<ol start=""1"" style=""text-align: justify;"" type=""1"">
<li>Check if the product exist in database</li>
<li>Check if we still have this product in stock ( quantity &gt; 0 )</li>
<li>If the product is already in cart increase the quantity</li>
<li>If not add the product to cart</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If the user comes to this page and the shopping cart is still empty there is a chance that user goes there by accident or feeling confused. So now we present her with simple instruction on how to buy stuff in our shop. “Your shopping cart is empty”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Continue shopping link goes to home page. And proceed to checkout link goes to checkout page.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Fig 4.5:</b> Cart Page – view option</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When a user updates the quantity then cart table will update in database. And also update every price portion in the cart view.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Fig 4.5:</b> Cart Page – update quantity option</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When a user delete the cart item then it delete from database.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Fig 4.6:</b> Cart Page – delete option</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After adding the product and removing all abandoned carts we don’t send the customer to the shopping cart page. Customer will stay on the product detail page. But this time the mini cart on the right side will show the product in his/her shopping cart.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It also shows the total amount after the shipping cost. If the shopping cart is still empty there so now we present “Your shopping cart is empty”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Fig 4.7:</b> Mini Cart Page</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This behavior (sending the customer to product page after adding a product) is actually depends on what kind of shop we’re running. If it is a shop where people usually buy more than one kind of product then its better then we should skip showing the shopping cart page and display the product page. But if people on this kind of shop usually only buy one product in a shopping session then it’s best if we display the shopping cart page.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>4.2.6 Shop: Checkout Page</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There are three steps to complete the checkout</p>
<ol start=""1"" style=""text-align: justify;"" type=""1"">
<li>Fill out the shipping and payment info and select the payment method.</li>
<li>Confirm the ordered items, shipping and payment info and the payment method.</li>
<li>Save the order information to the database. If the payment method is COD (cash on delivery ) go straight to the thank you page. If the customer chooses to pay with paypal submit the payment info to paypal server.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Step : 1</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Here the customer fills out his shipping address. It is required on every input field except Address2 field.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Fig 4.8:</b> Checkout Page Step 1 – Shipping Information</p>

48,"<h2 class=""blog_entry-title"">WHAT IS PSD2</h2>","<div class=""entry-content"">
<div class=""featured-thumb"">
<a href=""#"">
</a>
</div>
<div class=""entry-content"">
<p>It’s the second iteration of the Payment Services Directive (PSD) implemented by the European Union. It affects both individual consumers and businesses, and is set to revolutionise the way we make payments online.</p>
<p>The PSD was adopted in 2007 to create a single market for payments. The idea was to create a more unified payment market in Europe. Adoption of digital payments has advanced steadily since then and is outside the scope of PSD.</p>
<p>Hence, PSD2 was born. It was implemented in 2015 and will come into force in January 2018. Businesses must comply by then.</p>
<div class=""entry-content"">
<p>PSD2  is a wide-ranging directive, covering 117 Articles including mandatory encryption and strict controls on merchant charges for transactions, but a significant part is Article 29 – Access to Accounts (XS2A). This opens up consumers’ account information to third parties. These third parties can offer payment services but they won’t have to be banks.</p>
<p>PSD2 opens up consumers’ account information to third parties. These third parties can offer payment services but they won’t have to be banks.</p>
<p>Merchants (such as Amazon) will be able to take payments from your bank account without using an intermediary like Visa or PayPal. They will access your bank account directly from your bank using an API (Application Programming Interface).</p>
<p>Here is a list of players who have been defined in the PSD and PSD2:</p>
<p><strong>Credit Institutions</strong> – Banks</p>
<p><b>Payment Institutions</b> – They can offer several payment services.</p>
<p><b>Third Party Payment Service Providers (TPP)</b> – Don’t hold bank accounts so offer limited range of services.</p>
<p><b>Account Servicing Payment Service Providers (ASPSP)</b> – Provide and maintain payment accounts for consumers.</p>
<p><b>Account Information Service Providers (AISP)</b> – Bring together multiple payment accounts.</p>
<p><b>Payment Information Service Providers (PISP)</b> – Enable the use of online banking to make payments.</p>
<p><strong>XS2A Impact on banking</strong></p>
<p>For a long time, incumbent banks have had the monopoly on payment services. Before PSD2, banks have had to authorise payments for account holders.</p>
<p>Now, free-market competition will be introduced to the payment services market. This creates new opportunities for third party services to create online payment products.</p>
<p>Also, banks and brokers can currently profit from offering poor exchange rates for consumers. PSD2 aims to prohibit non-transparent pricing methods in transferring money abroad.</p>
<p><strong>Potential of XS2A for consumers</strong></p>
<p>Right now, consumers plump for outdated online payment technology that seems better adapted to the needs of traditional institutions than users.</p>
<p>Banks will be obliged to open up their IT systems to third parties making payments on behalf of account holders. They must also be prepared to provide a consolidated real-time view of a user’s account statements.</p>
<p>For example, if you have bank accounts with more than one bank, you will be able to see your account information in one place.</p>
<p>With PSD2, consumers can become the focus of financial services. We’ll see improvements to the piecemeal way consumers currently manage their finances.</p>
<p><strong>How banks could reposition themselves</strong></p>
<p>The intense popularity of fintech is one indication that the industry is ripe for disruption. Many banks have slowly started to respond to the fact that consumers are dissatisfied with their services.</p>
<p>Companies such as the UK’s first mobile bank Atom Bank, and competitor Monzo, are digital financial services that have gained great popularity. With PSD2, true disruption is becoming more of a real possibility.</p>
<p>Banks have to comply with very strict regulations, which is one barrier that prohibits their innovation. To overcome this, some banks have already been scrambling to invest in fintech startups, and three of the largest fintech investors are international banks.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<p>Businesses need to get ready for the changes coming into force with PSD2, and the huge opportunities for breaking into the payment services market. PSD2 should help to level the playing field and present more opportunities for innovation.</p>
<p>Startups have the advantage of being able to adopt disruptive new business models and move very quickly. Forward-thinking entrepreneurs will jump on this chance to make a profit.</p>
<p>Existing businesses can modify their service offering and take advantage of their brand name to quickly gain the trust of consumers looking for new payment services.</p>
<p>Consumers can get ready for a slew of new products and services that make managing their finances and buying online much easier.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
<p>New financial technologies often suffer from a slow uptake due to fears about security. Security is a valid concern.</p>
<p>Online transactions will require more security checks than we generally have now. Payment authentication is likely to require a combination of password or PIN, bank card, and/or fingerprint or voice recognition.</p>
<p>The reality is that most consumers are probably using services outside their normal bank without realising, such as PayPal. Consumers will need to switch on to the reality of online payment services, since those who don’t may get left behind.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>
<p>All the new terms can be a little overwhelming. The core message to take away from PSD2 is that the online payments market is becoming more unified.</p>
<p>Some of the power is being wrested away from banks and placed back into the hands of the consumer. This spells good news for individuals and businesses.</p>
<p>It’s an exciting time for fintech. Startups and other businesses will compete to offer a new breed of financial services and products, following on from first movers like Monzo, and Mint in the US. Incumbents will be looking to invest these new businesses.</p>

49,"<h2 class=""blog_entry-title"">WHY DO WE NEED INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW?</h2>","<div class=""entry-content"">
<div class=""featured-thumb"">
<a href=""#"">
</a>
</div>
<div class=""entry-content"">
<p class=""id7""> War is forbidden. The Charter of the United Nations states clearly that the threat or use of force against other States is unlawful. Since 1945, war has no longer been an acceptable way to settle differences between States. So why talk about international rules dealing with armed conflicts (or war) and their effects, if the Charter has banned recourse to force in international relations?</p>
<p class=""id7""> There are three answers of a legal nature to that question – and a sad conclusion:</p>
<p class=""id8""> – The Charter has not completely outlawed the use of force. Indeed, States retain the right to defend themselves, individually or collectively, against attacks on their independence or their territory, in response to a (legal or illegal) use of force.</p>
<p class=""id9""> – The Charter’s prohibition of the use of force does not encompass internal armed conflicts (or civil wars).</p>
<p class=""id9""> – Chapter VII of the Charter allows member States the use of force in collective action to maintain or restore international peace and security.</p>
<p class=""id9""> – Finally (and this is not a legal argument!), wars do in fact occur, as we all know, despite their being outlawed by the Charter of the United Nations. Armed conflicts are a sad reality in our contemporary world.</p>
<p class=""id7""> The conclusion is inevitable: there is a need for international rules which limit the effects of war on people and property, and which protect certain particularly vulnerable groups of persons. That is the goal of international humanitarian law, with the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols as its main expression and an important body of customary law as a decisive supplementary source of law.</p>
<p class=""id7""> 2. From Henry Dunant to present-day international humanitarian law</p>
<p class=""id7""> After the shock of seeing the battlefield of Solferino and the agony of so many wounded soldiers lying untended, Henry Dunant suggested action on two levels:</p>
<p class=""id9""> – to establish an organization to assist wounded military personnel: the Red Cross; and</p>
<p class=""id9""> – to conclude an international covenant to guarantee the protection of the wounded on the battlefield: the very first Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class=""id9""> With these two steps, Dunant hoped to ease the suffering caused by war. Only later in his life did he plead for a ban on war itself.</p>
<p class=""id7""> In this article we shall not examine the first of Dunant’s proposals, i.e. the creation of the Red Cross, with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) as its first institution established in 1863 in Geneva. We shall rather discuss his second suggestion, namely the creation of humanitarian law, its substance and some of the problems encountered in its implementation. Let us, however, underline that legal rules alone are unable to cope with the real problems caused by armed conflicts. Nor can any one organization alone deal with the multiple issues raised by war. A combination of international humanitarian law and action by the parties to an armed conflict, by the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and by the community of States, by non-governmental organizations and by all persons of good will is needed to bring about better protection for the vulnerable victims of warfare.</p>
<p class=""id7""> Let us now examine international humanitarian law as it stands today, with a brief glance at its history and its development.</p>
<p class=""id7""> The first treaty on the protection of military victims of warfare was drawn up and signed in 1864 in Geneva, on the initiative of Henry Dunant, at a Diplomatic Conference convened by the Swiss Government and attended by representatives of almost all States of that time.</p>
<p class=""id7""> In 1899, in The Hague, international protection was extended to wounded, sick and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea , and in 1929 prisoners of war were also placed under the protection of the law of Geneva.</p>
<p class=""id7""> In 1949 four Geneva Conventions, which are still in force today, were adopted, each of them dealing with the protection of a specific category of persons who are not, or are no longer, taking part in hostilities:</p>
<p class=""id10""> First Convention : on the care of the wounded and sick members of armed forces in the field</p>
<p class=""id10""> Second Convention : on the care of the wounded, sick and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea</p>
<p class=""id10""> Third Convention : on the treatment of prisoners of war</p>
<p class=""id10""> Fourth Convention : on the protection of civilian persons in time of war.</p>
<p class=""id7""> The Geneva Conventions of 1949 are a legacy of World War II. Starting from the tragic experience gained in that conflict, they greatly improve the legal protection of war victims, in particular of civilians in the power of the enemy. Today, practically all States are party to the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Accepted as they are by the whole community of nations, they have become truly universal law.</p>
<p class=""id7""> The various treaties that make up what is known as ” Geneva law ” deal extensively with the fate of persons who have ceased to fight or have fallen into the power of the adversary. They do not set limits to the way military operations may be fought. Concurrently with the development of ” Geneva law ” , States have therefore codified, in various stages, international rules setting limits to the conduct of military operations. The main thrust of what is known as ” Hague law ” , with the various Hague Conventions of 1907 as its main expression, is to limit warfare to attacks against objectives which are relevant to the outcome of military operations. Thus, the civilian population must be immune from military attacks.</p>
<p class=""id7""> The new Geneva Conventions of 1949 did not develop the rules of ” Hague law ” . In particular, they failed to cover a fundamental issue of international humanitarian law: the protection of the civilian population against direct effects of hostilities (attacks on the civilian population, indiscriminate bombardment, etc.). The lessons of Coventry, Dresden, Stalingrad or Tokyo were still to be drawn.</p>
<p class=""id7""> Furthermore, new technologies had produced new weapons, i.e. a new potential for destruction, but also new techniques for ensuring the protection of war victims.</p>
<p class=""id7""> Decolonization had more than doubled the number of States and, with new types of conflict (wars of national liberation), some new priorities for humanitarian law had emerged.</p>
<p class=""id7""> Finally, the ever-increasing number of civil wars with frequent recourse to guerrilla warfare demonstrated the need to strengthen the protection of victims of non-international armed conflict.</p>
<p class=""id7""> In response to these challenges Switzerland convened a Diplomatic Conference in Geneva. From 1974 to 1977 that conference worked out two new treaties of international humanitarian law, the Protocols additional to the Geneva Conventions . They were adopted on 8 June 1977 and, since that date, they have been open for ratification or accession by all States party to the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Today, a clear majority of States are already bound by the two Protocols (or at least by one of them). The ICRC is doing it utmost to encourage the remaining States to accede to the Protocols as well.</p>
<p class=""id7""> 3. A look at the substance of the law: humanitarian limits on warfare</p>
<p class=""id7""> Humanitarian law has become a complex set of rules dealing with a great variety of issues. Indeed, six major treaties with more than 600 articles and a fine mesh of customary law rules place restrictions on the use of violence in wartime. Such complexity should not, however, make us forget that the gist of humanitarian law can be summarized in a few fundamental principles:</p>
<p class=""id11""> 1. Persons who are not, or are no longer, taking part in hostilities shall be respected, protected and treated humanely. They shall be given appropriate care, without any discrimination.</p>
<p class=""id11""> 2. Captured combatants and other persons whose freedom has been restricted shall be treated humanely. They shall be protected against all acts of violence, in particular against torture. If put on trial they shall enjoy the fundamental guarantees of a regular judicial procedure.</p>
<p class=""id11""> 3. The right of parties to an armed conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited. No superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering shall be inflicted.</p>
<p class=""id11""> 4. In order to spare the civilian population, armed forces shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and civilian objects on the one hand, and military objectives on the other. Neither the civilian population as such nor individual civilians or civilian objects shall be the target of military attacks.</p>
<p class=""id7""> These principles give expression to what the International Court of Justice has called in the Corfu Channel Case ” elementary considerations of humanity ” , and later ” fundamental general principles of humanitarian law ” (Case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activit ies in and against Nicaragua). As general principles of international law they are the cornerstones of the protection of war victims through law. They are binding under all circumstances and no derogation is ever permissible.</p>
<p class=""id7""> There is another fundamental idea which deserves to be mentioned here: the rules of international law apply to all armed conflicts, irrespective of their origin or cause. They have to be respected in all circumstances and with regard to all persons protected by them, without any discrimination. In modern humanitarian law there is no place for discriminatory treatment of victims of warfare based on the concept of ” just war ” .</p>
<p class=""id7""> Whereas the general principles mentioned above are common to the law on all types of armed conflict, there are two different sets of specific rules: one for international armed conflicts and another for non-international armed conflicts (or civil wars).</p>
<p class=""id7""> 4. Different types of armed conflict</p>
<p class=""id7""> International armed conflicts are conflicts between States. The four 1949 Geneva Conventions and Protocol I deal extensively with the humanitarian issues raised by such conflicts. The whole body of law on prisoners of war, their status and their treatment is geared to wars between States (Third Convention). The Fourth Convention states inter alia the rights and duties of an occupying power, i.e. a State whose armed forces control part or all of the territory of another State. Protocol I deals exclusively with international armed conflicts.</p>
<p class=""id7""> Under Protocol I of 8 June 1977, wars of national liberation must also be treated as conflicts of an international character. A war of national liberation is a conflict in which a people is fighting against a colonial power, in the exercise of its right of self- determination. Whereas the concept of the right of self-determination is today well accepted by the international community, the conclusions to be drawn from that right for the purposes of humanitarian law and, in particular, its application to specific conflict situations are still somewhat controversial.</p>
<p class=""id7""> A mere glance at the newspapers or a world map reveals, however, that conflicts between States are today the exception rather than the rule. The majority of armed conflicts are waged within the territory of a State: they are conflicts of a non-international character. A common feature of many such internal armed conflicts is the intervention of armed forces of another State, supporting the government or the insurgents.</p>
<p class=""id7""> The substantive rules of humanitarian law governing non-international armed conflicts are much simpler than their counterparts governing international conflicts. They are derived from one main source, namely Article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, which enjoins the parties to an internal conflict to respect some basic principles of humanitarian behaviour already mentioned above. It is particularly important to note that common Article 3 is binding not only on governments but also on insurgents, without, however, conferring any special status upon them.</p>
<p class=""id7""> Additional Protocol II of 1977 supplements Article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions with a number of more specific provisions. This is a welcome contribution to the strengthening of humanitarian protection in situations of internal armed conflict. Protocol II has, however, a narrower scope of application than common Article 3. It applies only if the insurgent party controls part of the national territory.</p>
<p class=""id7""> 5. Humanitarian law and human rights</p>
<p class=""id7""> Article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions deals with internal armed conflicts, i.e. with matters pertaining to the internal affairs of States. As the regulation of internal affairs is basically the prerogative of the sovereign State, the decision taken in 1949 to include Article 3 in the four Geneva Conventions was a great event. It must be remembered, however, that one year earlier, in 1948, the United Nations General Assembly had adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That document reflected growing international concern about an important aspect of the internal affairs of States. Indeed, international rules on the protection of human rights oblige States to recognize and respect a number of basic rights of the individual and to ensure that they are upheld. Humanitarian law does the same in times of armed conflict. It enjoins the parties to a conflict to respect and to preserve the lives and dignity of captured enemy soldiers or of civilians who are in their power. What, then, distinguishes humanitarian law from human rights law? Or are they the same?</p>
<p class=""id7""> The goals of human rights law and humanitarian law overlap. Both humanitarian law and human rights are designed to restrict the power of State authorities, with a view to safeguarding the fundamental rights of the individual. Human rights treaties (supported by customary law) achieve this objective in a comprehensive way insofar as they cover almost all aspects of life. Their rules must be applied to all persons and be respected in all circumstances (although a number of rights may be suspended in time of emergency). Humanitarian law, however, applies only in time of armed conflict. Its provisions are formulated in such a wa y as to take into account the special circumstances of warfare. They may not be abrogated under any circumstances. Usually they apply ” across the front line ” , i.e. the armed forces have to respect humanitarian law in their dealings with the enemy (and not in the relations with their own nationals). In internal armed conflicts, however, human rights law and international humanitarian law apply concurrently.</p>
<p class=""id7""> In other words, humanitarian law is a specialized body of human rights law, fine tuned for times of armed conflict. Some of its provisions have no equivalent in human rights law, in particular the rules on the conduct of hostilities or on the use of weapons. Conversely, human rights law covers several domains which are outside the scope of humanitarian law (e.g. the political rights of individual persons). Despite their overlapping, human rights law and humanitarian law remain distinct branches of public international law.</p>
<p class=""id7""> 6. Implementation and scrutiny</p>
<p class=""id7""> Parties to a given humanitarian treaty have to comply with obligations arising out of that treaty, whereas all States have to respect provisions that are part of customary law. This is of course the case for all international law rules. Indeed, States have to respect their international commitments and have to take all measures necessary to facilitate implementation of the law. If a party fails to do so, the State may be held responsible for a wrongful act.</p>
<p class=""id7""> The Geneva Conventions and the Additional Protocols require the States party to adopt a number of measures in order to assure compliance with these treaties. Some of these measures have to be taken in peacetime, others in the course of an armed conflict. In this short overview, only three such ob ligations will be mentioned, as examples:</p>
<p class=""id9""> – Instructions to and training of the armed forces : the complex set of obligations arising out of the Conventions and the Protocols must be translated into a language which is clearly understandable to those who have to comply with the rules, in particular the members of armed forces, according to their ranks and their functions. Good manuals on humanitarian law play a decisive part in effectively spreading knowledge of that law among military personnel. Rules which are not understood by or remain unknown to those who have to respect them will not have much effect.</p>
<p class=""id12"">– Domestic legislation on implementation : Many provisions of the Geneva Conventions and of their Additional Protocols imperatively require each State Party to enact laws and issue other regulations to guarantee full implementation of its international obligations. This holds particularly true for the obligation to make grave breaches of international humanitarian law (commonly called ” war crimes ” ) crimes under domestic law. In the same way, misuse of the red cross or the red crescent distinctive emblem must be prosecuted under domestic law.</p>
<p class=""id12"">– Prosecution of persons who have committed grave breaches of international humanitarian law : Such persons must be prosecuted by any State party under whose authority they find themselves. That State may, however, extradite the suspect to another State Party which is willing to prosecute him. Individuals accused of violating humanitarian law may also be tried by an international criminal court. The United Nations Security Council has established two such courts : the Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda. On 17 July 1998, a Diplomatic Conference convened by the United Nations in Rome adopted the Statute of the International Criminal Court. For the first time in history a permanent international court has jurisdiction over crimes committed not only in the course of international armed conflicts but also during non-international armed conflicts. The Court’s jurisdiction does not affect the obligation of States Parties to prosecute war criminals in their own domestic courts.</p>
<p class=""id7""> Returning to the question of implementation of humanitarian law by parties to an armed conflict, it should be emphasized that States do not exist in a vacuum; they are part of the community of all States party to the humanitarian treaties. States not involved in an armed conflict have a legitimate interest in seeing that the Geneva Conventions or the Protocols (to which they are party) are respected by the parties to that conflict. One may even go a step further and argue that States have an obligation to work for respect for those treaties by the parties to a given armed conflict. Article 1 of the four Geneva Conventions and Protocol I suggests such an interpretation: ” The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances ” . The message seems to be clear. Its political implications, on the other hand, have not yet been fully understood.</p>
<p class=""id7""> The Conventions furthermore require that each party to an international armed conflict designate a third (neutral) State as a Protecting Power . A Protecting Power is a State which safeguards the interests of one party in its relations with the other party to the conflict. As such, Protecting Powers have to ensure that the belligerents fulfil their humanitarian obligations.</p>
<p class=""id7""> Recent practice shows that for various reasons States are no longer prepared to appoint Protecting Powers. An institution of a special nature has stepped into the breach: the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) . Founded in 1863 as a charitable organization on the instigation of Henry Dunant, the ICRC has over the years maintained its character as a private institution anchored in Swiss law, with Swiss citizens making up its governing body. Thus, the ICRC is not an international organization with States as its constituents (such as the United Nations or the International Labour Organization), and governments have no direct influence on ICRC activities. Yet the International Committee’s mandate is international, and the whole world is its field of action. The ICRC works through its delegates. Its funds are provided by voluntary contributions from States party to the Geneva Conventions, from National Societies and from private donors. To underline its special role States have granted the ICRC obevserver status at the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p class=""id7""> Although a private institution, the ICRC has an important role to play in the implementation of humanitarian law by the parties to an armed conflict. Unlike a Protecting Power, the ICRC does not act on the instructions of a party to the conflict. The ICRC acts in its own name, as a neutral intermediary between the two sides. Its scope of action is also much broader than the tasks of a Protecting Power. Moreover, in its approach to governments, the ICRC chooses the course of confidential diplomacy, an approach which incidentally enables its delegates in their contacts with belligerents to use words as tough and clear as circumstances require. Only if confidential representations have no further chance of bringing about the intended result will the ICRC appeal publicly to States. In the course of more than 125 years the ICRC has acquired considerable experience in persuading States and other parties to armed conflicts to respect h umanitarian law in international conflicts and in civil war.</p>
<p class=""id7""> Under the Geneva Conventions, parties to an international armed conflict are under an obligation to accept visits by ICRC delegates to all prisoner-of-war camps, to all places where civilians of enemy nationality may be detained and to occupied territories in general. In other situations, where the delegates have no such general right of access, the ICRC may ” offer its services to the parties to a conflict ” . In other words, the ICRC will negotiate the right to discharge its humanitarian mandate on the territories of all the warring parties. This is generally the case in non-international armed conflicts.</p>
<p class=""id7""> In the same way, parties to armed conflicts have to allow relief operations in favour of those in need, be they detainees, especially vulnerable groups of civilians or the general population, including in occupied territories. ICRC delegates ensure that medical services or food aid are provided according to needs and that strict impartiality is observed.</p>
<p class=""id7""> The method of verifying respect for humanitarian law differs considerably from the procedures espoused by human rights treaties. The latter provide, inter alia , for a system of formal complaints to a supranational body, and in some cases, to a supranational court. Such complaints may originate from individuals or from States. In contrast to this well- structured system, humanitarian law relies much more on informal procedures. Their aim is not primarily to state the law and to redress a wrong but rather to convince the wrongdoer to change his behaviour and thus to prevent further violations, for the benefit of all persons affected by the conflict.</p>
<p class=""id7""> 7. Final remarks</p>
<p class=""id7""> The objective of international humanitarian law is to limit the suffering caused by warfare and to alleviate its effects. Its rules are the result of a delicate balance between the exigencies of warfare ( ” military necessity ” ) on the one hand and the laws of humanity on the other. Humanitarian law is a sensitive matter and it suffers no tampering. It must be respected in all circumstances, for the sake of the survival of human values and, quite often, for the sheer necessity of protecting life. Each and every one of us can do something to promote greater understanding of its main goals and fundamental principles, thereby paving the way for better respect for them. Better respect for humanitarian law by all States and all parties to armed conflicts will do much to help create a more humane world.</p>
