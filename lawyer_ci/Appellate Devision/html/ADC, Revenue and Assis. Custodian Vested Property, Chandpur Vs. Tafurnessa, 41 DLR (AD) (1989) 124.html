Leave was granted to consider the question whether the High Court Division has erred in law in upholding the decree that was passed by the Appel­late Court below on the ground that the Emergency having been lifted on 16.2.69 the proceeding in V.P. Case No. 24 of 1978-79 was illegal and void.<br/> <br/>3. Facts are as follows:-Plaintiff filed a title suit being Title Suit No. 198 of 1979 in the Second Court of Munsif, Chandpur, for a declaration that the lease of the suit land by defendant Nos. 1 to 3 is ille­gal, without jurisdiction, collusive and not binding upon the plaintiff and for permanent injunction re­straining the defendant from giving possession to de­fendant No. 3. Her case was that she purchased the suit land from one Gopal Chandra Shil by a kabala executed on 7.2.75 and registered on 19.5.75 and since then she has been possessing the same. Defen­dant No. 2 wanted to grab the suit land and filed a petition falsely in the office of defendant No. 1 to treat the property as enemy property whereupon Vested Property Case No. 24 of 1978-79 was initiat­ed by defendant No. 1 and treating the property as vested property leased out the same to defendant No. 2. The plaintiff challenged this decision by filing the suit.<br/> <br/>4. The trial Court dismissed the suit on the finding that the plaintiff being out of possession the suit is not maintainable and moreover found the ka­bala of the plaintiff as forged and fraudulent.<br/> <br/>5. The Appellate Court below, however, re­versed the judgment and came to the finding that the plaintiff had been possessing the suit land since her purchase by kabala dated 7.2.75. It granted the prayer for injunction for restraining the defendant from leas­ing out the suit land as an enemy property. The em­phasis was led to the fact that the kabala was execut­ed and registered in 1975 and it will be presumed that vendor Gopal Chandra Shil was physically present in Bangladesh at the time of the registration. The plaintiff’s possession was also found. In this view of the matter, the suit was decreed. In revision, the High Court Division affirmed this decree and further ex­pressed the view that the Emergency having been withdrawn on 16.2.69 the proceeding in V.P. Case No. 24/78-79 treating the suit land as enemy proper­ty was illegal.<br/> <br/>6. Mr. Moksudur Rahman, learned Counsel ap­pearing for the defendant-appellant submitted that the point of law has been settled by this Court in the Case of M/s. Dulichand Omraolal Vs. Bangladesh, 33 DLR (AD) 30. But he submitted that certain factual position needs to be investigated and appropriately order of remand should be passed by this Court send­ing it to the Appellate Court below. Mr. Moksudur Rahman argued that evidence was not scrutinised by the Appellate Court below to come to the finding that the registration having been made in 1975 it will be presumed that the vendor was physically present in Bangladesh.<br/> <br/>7. Mr. Khondker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, learned Counsel appearing for the plaintiff-respondents, drew our attention to the lower Appellate Court's judgment for coming to the conclusion, (i) that the plaintiff-opposite-party has been possessing the suit land since her purchase by kabala dated 7.2.1975, (ii) that Gopal Chandra Shil did not leave this country and he was a Bangladeshi National in the year 1975 when the kabala was executed and registered, (iii) de­fendant No. 1-2 never got possession of the suit land, (iv) presumption is attached by law under sec­tion 60 of the Registration Act that the plaintiffs vendor was physically present in Bangladesh and lastly (v) injunction prayer was granted rightly re­straining defendant No.1 from leasing out of the suit land treating it as enemy property. Mr. Ahmed argued that i.e aforesaid findings have been arrived at on evidence and there is no scope for a remand order. He submitted further that leave was granted on a point which has become academic now because the point has been settled by this Court in M/s. Duli­chand Omraolal case.<br/> <br/>8. The submission of Mr. Khondker Mahbu­buddin Ahmed has considerable force. The legal as­pect of the matter has been settled already and Mr. Moksudur Rahman also docs not dispute this propo­sition. Therefore Mr. Moksudur Rahman argued forcefully for remand. But a remand order is not to be granted as a matter of routine. Section 29 ALL 184 P.C. and 17 ALL 112 P.C.Mr. Moksudur Rahman found it difficult to pinpoint the area of investigation which could be done on remand. The crucial question is as to the physical presence of the vendor. It is pre­sumed under section 60 that the registration was done in accordance with law and the requirement of the law was fulfilled. It is a rebuttable presumption, no doubt, but Mr. Moksudur Rahman could not argue, how the evidence as it is, has rebutted the pre­sumption. The defendants got ample opportunity at the trial stage and no such rebuttal evidence was ad­duced. Hence the prayer for remand does not merit consideration. Since the point has been settled al­ready on which the leave was granted, Mr. Ahmed is correct in saying the appeal has become of mere aca­demic interest.<br/> <br/>In the result, therefore, this appeal is dismissed without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
