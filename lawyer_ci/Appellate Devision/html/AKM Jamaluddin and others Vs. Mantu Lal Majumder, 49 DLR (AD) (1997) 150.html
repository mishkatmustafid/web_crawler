The doctor who granted the certificate or a witness who knows the doctor’s signature should be examined. As such the trial Court’s judgment was set aside and the case was sent back on remand to give an opportunity to the defendant to prove his illness.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> The plaintiff-petitioners now seek leave to appeal from the aforesaid judgment and order of the High Court Division dated 11-8-94.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> Mr. A Baset Majumder, learned Advocate for the plaintiff-petitioners, submits that the ex parte decree having been passed after long 7 years from the date of filing of the suit on the failure of the defendant to appear on the date fixed for hearing the application filed under Order IX rule 13 CPC was itself a motivated one and both the Courts having found that the defendant-respondent failed to prove his illness the order of remand is in the nature of giving a premium to the defendant for his laches.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> As the suit has been restored on payment of compensatory cost to the plaintiff-petitioners we do not think that it is a fit case for interference.<br/> <br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>
