The facts of the case are that the plain­tiffs filed Title Suit No.31 of 1995 in the 2nd Court of Subordinate Judge, Sylhet for declaration of title stating that the predecessor of the defendant Md. Sadir having title and possession over the sched­ule land died leaving behind one son A.S.M. Ali Ashraf, three daughters named Mst. Momtaz Begum, Noor Jahan Begum, Mother of the plaintiff and jahanara Begum and wife, Rafiza Begum. The plaintiff's mother, Noor Jahan Begum became the title holder and possessor of 2 annas and 17 gandas of the schedule prop­erty. Jahanara Begum died unmarried after the death of her mother, Rafiza Begum. When the settlement survey started Noor Jahan Begum was in her husband's house and hence was not aware of the survey record and she died leaving mother, hus­band and a son who is the plaintiff. The plaintiff came to know in the first week of the September, 1984 that his mother's name was not in the khatian of the schedule property and hence he tiled the suit for declaration of title.<br/> <br/>3. The Subordinate Judge, 2nd Court, Sylhet took up the hearing of the suit and on 15.01.1986 dismissed the suit ex parte.<br/> <br/>4. The plaintiff did not take any step for setting aside the exparte decree either by filling a restoration petition or by filling a separate suit rather preferred Title Appeal No.77 of 1986 before the Court of District Judge, Sylhet who by the judgment and decree dated 24.03.1994 allowed the appeal setting aside the judgment and decree of the Trail Court and declared the title of plaintiff over the schedule land.<br/> <br/>5. The defendants as petitioners filed an application under Section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure against the said judgment and decree dated 24.03.1994 of the Additional District Judge, 1st Court, Sylhet allowing the Title Appeal No.77 of 1986 and reversing the judgment and decree dated 15.01.19986 of the Subordinate Judge, 2nd Court, Sylhet. The petitioners in the said application mentioned valuation of the application at Tk. 1,00,000/- and the High Court Division after hearing by the order dated 17.07.1994 issued Rule calling for the record and stayed the operation of the impugned judgment and decree passed by the lower appellate Court for a period of 4(four) months. The petitioners, subse­quently, on different dates obtained order of extension of the stay order from the High Court Division and lastly on 24.07.1996   the High Court Division extended the order of stay till disposal of the Rule. The said is pending.<br/> <br/>6. Mr. A.J. Mohammad Ali learned Counsel, appearing for the petitioners sub­mitted that the Rule is made ready for hearing and the matter on 28.06.2006 appeared in the list of the High Court Division for fixing date of hearing. When the matter was taken up the learned Advocate for the petitioners pointed out that the valuation of the Rule is of Tk. 1,00,000/- and as such, as per pecu­niary jurisdiction the rule would be heard by a Single Bench of the High Court Division. The High Court   Division ignored the submission of the learned Advocate for the petitioners and knowing fully well about the jurisdiction fixed the Rule for hearing. That on 17.07.1994 the pecuniary jurisdiction of the High Court Division was about Tk. 50,000/- and sub­sequently the pecuniary jurisdiction of a single Bench has been enhanced upto Tk. 1,00,000.00 and at recent a single Bench has the jurisdiction to hear the revision having valuation upto of Tk. 1,00,000/-. The present Rule having  valuation of Tk. 1,00,000/- is thus triable by a Single Bench instead a Division Bench of the High Court Division ignored the submis­sion of the learned Advocate for the peti­tioner at the same time the jurisdiction given under the Rules of this Court.<br/> <br/>7. As regards the submissions of the learned counsel this will suffice to men­tion that the assumption of jurisdiction to hear a matter by a Division Bench in respect of a Single Court matter suffers from no infirmity and depends upon the absolute discretion of the Court con­cerned. The jurisdictional problem sought to be raised in the instant cause could not cause any miscarriage of justice, rather it will enhance the cause of justice. Had it been a case that a Single Bench is in session of a Division rather the situation would be otherwise, for the very reason of jurisdictional error and possible miscar­riage of justice.<br/><br/>8. In view of the above, we find no sub­stance in the submissions of the learned Counsel for the petitioners.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
