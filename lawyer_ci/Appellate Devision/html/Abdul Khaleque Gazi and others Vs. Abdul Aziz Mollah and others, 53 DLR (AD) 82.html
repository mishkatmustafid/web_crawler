Thereafter in Title Appeal No. 50 of 1986 the learned Additional District Judge set aside the judgment and decree and sent the case back on remand to the trial Court with a direction for taking fresh evidence in order to prove “Salishnama” which was the basis of the plaintiffs’ claim. Thereafter the plaintiffs filed a petition for amendment of the plaint seeking to incorporate some more reliefs by way of declaration of title and confirmation of possession and that amendment was allowed by the trial Court by order dated 10-5-1999. The defendant-petitioners were allowed to file additional written statement in view of the amendment but no such statement was filed. Against that order allowing amendment the petitioners moved the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 3509 of 1999 and a Single Bench of that Division by the impugned judgment dated 3rd July, 2000 discharged the Rule.  <br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> Mr. MA Jalil, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioners submits that this amendment allowed after remand of the suit has caused miscarriage of justice as it has changed the nature and character of the suit.  <br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> Mr. Jalil led us through the judgment of the High Court Division and it appears that only the prayer portion of the plaint was allowed to be amended and in so doing the High Court Division found that no illegality has been committed. We are in full agreement with the finding of the High Court Division. The learned Advocate for the petitioner failed to point out any legal infirmity in the judgment of the High Court Division which may call for our interference.  <br/> <br/>There is no merit in this petition and the same is accordingly dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>
