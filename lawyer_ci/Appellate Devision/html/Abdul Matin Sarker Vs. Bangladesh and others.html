While the petitioner was so holding a valid passport a circular <i>vide</i> Memo No. </span><span style='Siyam Rupali ANSI";color:red;'>üxjxf¡e£x(p¡d¡lZ)-02/10(h¢q-1)/334</span> dated 27.03.2010 was issued by the Government launching machine ReadablePassport (hereinafter referred to as “the MRP”) offering to the citizen holdingvalid passport to replace their existing hand-written passport with the MRP.Thereafter on 03.10.2010 another circular was issued by the Government saying, <i>inter alia</i>, that in case of replacementof hand written passport by the MRP no police report would be required.Thereafter by another circular dated 06.2.2011 the relaxation of police inquirywas further extended to cases of renewal saying that even in case of renewal ofhand written passport and replacement of the same with MRP no police reportshall be required.</p><p style='Times New Roman"'>3.<span style='Times New Roman"'></span><span style="line-height:110%;">With the above factualbackground the petitioner made an application on 10.2.2013 for replacement ofhis hand- written passport as mentioned above with an MRP having surrenderedhis original passport to the authority in accordance with law. Pursuant to theapplication made by the petitioner the passport authority issued a DeliverySlip (Annex-D) on 10.02.2013 bearing No. </span>680100000079336 wherein 17.3.2013was fixed for delivery of the MRP. The petitioner having received the deliveryslip was waiting for his MRP to be received on the date mentioned in the slip.In the delivery slip there was a mention that ‘passport notification will besent to the applicant’s mobile phone/email’. The date for delivery expired andthereafter quit some time elapsed but no notification of the kind was receivedby the petitioner. In the circumstances the petitioner sent his representativeto the passport office to enquire about the matter.

Ultimately having had no other alternative thepetitioner served upon the passport authority a demand of justice notice on20.7.2013. Pursuant to the notice demanding justice respondent No.3 who happensto be one of the Deputy Director of the passport department made a reply to thelegal notice on 25.07.2013 in which he stated, <i>inter alia,</i> that upon an inquiry made by special branch of police,Narshingdi it transpired that the petitioner is a charge sheeted accused in apending criminal case and in the circumstances the authority is unable issueany fresh passport or make replacement of the original passport with an MRP.</span></p><p style='Times New Roman"'>5.<span style='Times New Roman"'></span><span style="line-height:110%;">With the backdrop of facts the petitionerobtained the instant  Rule seeking adirection in the form of <i>mandamus</i>upon the respondents to replace his hand written passport by an MRP. </span></p><p style='Times New Roman"'>6.<span style='Times New Roman"'></span><span style="line-height:110%;">Mr. Sakib Rezwan Kabir, learned Advocateappearing for the petitioner submits that the issuance of the MRP to thepetitioner is most illegally withheld by the authority on the ground ofpendency of criminal case inasmuch as there is no bar in<b> l</b>aw on  replacement of the original passport with MRPon account of mere  pendency of thecriminal case. He took us through a circular (Annexure-B)  issued by the Ministry of Home on 03.10.2010wherein  it is clearly stated that incase of  replacement of hand- writtenpassport with an MRP no police report shall be required. He further submitsthat the verification requirement was further relaxed by another circular dated06.2.2011 wherein it was stated that even in cases of renewal of hand- writtenpassport police report shall not be required. Mr. Sakib contended  that the passport authority in withholdingthe MRP of the petitioner clearly acted in violation of law to the detriment ofthe petitioner’s personal liberty guaranteed by the constitution itself. In thecircumstances, the petitioner had no alternative other than seeking mandamusfor an appropriate remedy.  </span></p><p style='Times New Roman"'>7.<span style='Times New Roman"'></span><span style="line-height:110%;">Mr. Mutahar Hossain learned Deputy AttorneyGeneral found it difficult to defend the <i>factum</i>of withholding of MRP of a citizen on account of charge-sheet submitted againsthim in a pending criminal case. </span></p><p style='Times New Roman"'>8.<span style='Times New Roman"'></span><span style="line-height:110%;">We have heard the learned Advocates and perusedthe law and the records of the case. It appears that Articles 6 and 7 ofBangladesh Passport Order, 1973, provides certain conditions upon which thepassport authority may refuse to issue passport or travel documents or vary,cancel the endorsements thereon or impound the passport already issued. Article6 of the Order says, amongst others, that the passport authority may refuse toissue passport or travel documents if it is satisfied that the applicant isevading or likely to evade appearance in any pending proceedings against him ina criminal court or that an order prohibiting his departure from Bangladesh ismade by the court. Article 7 says, <i>interalia,</i> that the passport authority, in fit circumstances, may vary or cancelthe endorsement/conditions on a passport or travel document and ask the holderof passport or travel document to deliver up such passport or travel document.Sub-Article (2) of Article 7 says, <i>interalia</i>, that the passport authority may impound or revoke a passport ortravel document if a) the passport/travel document is in wrongful possession ofany person b) passport/travel document is obtained by suppression of facts andc) the passport/travel document is required to be impounded/revoked in theinterest of sovereignty, integrity or security of Bangladesh or in the publicinterest. The passport or travel document may also be revoked under the Orderon conviction of the holder thereof for violation of any of the provisions ofthe Order or the Rules framed thereunder. </span></p><p style='Times New Roman"'>9.<span style='Times New Roman"'></span><span style="line-height:110%;">Seen in the light of the law the reply given bythe passport authority in justification of their refusal to issue MRP to thepetitioner as contained in Annexure-F seems to us to be grossly arbitrary andfar beyond powers conferred by law.

Furthermore,the circular bearing Memo No. PP (G-1)01/10(immi.i) 1026 dated 03.10.2010issued by the Ministry of Home clearly mentions that in cases of applicationfor new handwritten passport or MRP by surrendering the old handwrittenpassport no police report shall be required. We are unable to follow from wherethe passport authority has found requirement of police report in cases ofissuance of MRP on surrender of the handwritten passport or that the Passport Orderof 1973 requires police report before replacing the handwritten passport byMRP. The <i>factum</i> of withholding of theMRP of the petitioner on the recommendation made by police by reference to apending criminal case and finding legal bar on that count seem to us to be theresult of total non-application of mind of the respondents to the true legalposition and <span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt">their cavalier attitude to theright of the citizens.</span> </span></p><p style='Times New Roman"'>11.<span style='Times New Roman"'></span><span style="line-height:110%;">The power of the passport authority to renewthe old handwritten passport or to issue new handwritten passport or MRP onsurrender of the old handwritten passport is not fettered by or conditionedupon police report.
