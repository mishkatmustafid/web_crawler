Plaintiffs are the appellants. They filed Title Suit No. 1974 in the 1st Court of Munsif, Moulvibazar, Sylhet against the respondents praying for declaration of their right of way over the suit lands, a pathway, and for permanent injunction re­straining the defendants from causing any damage thereto and/or in the alternative interfering with plaintiff’s access over the suit property.<br/> <br/>3. The plaintiffs claimed that they and the oth­er inhabitants of the locality have been using the suit pathway from time immemorial and the path­way leads to the main road of the locality. They made improvement of the same at their own costs and it is the only and unavoidable way to reach the public road. The suit pathway had been recorded wrongly as cultivable land along with its contiguous lands and taking advantage of such recording the principal defendants are trying to change the nature of the pathway and also to interfere with the plain­tiffs' right of way. The defendants contended that it is a ridge (ILO) of its contiguous cultivable lands. There are convenient ways joining the two main roads of the locality and neither the plaintiffs nor other inhabitants of the locality used the suit land as a pathway. The plaintiffs have filed the suit out of grudge and enmity and hence it is liable to be dis­missed.<br/> <br/>4. The trial court on consideration of the evi­dence and the report of the Advocate Commissioner came to the conclusion that "There might be a lot of pathways open for the people of the locality but I have no reason to reject the plaintiffs' claim which they proved to have been using from time immemo­rial." The learned Munsif considered the plaintiffs' claim "that they along with some other inhabitants of the locality have been using the suit pathway as of easement right from time immemorial." In this view of the matter, the suit was decreed. "The plain­tiffs' right of easement over the suit pathway is de­clared."<br/> <br/>5. On appeal the Appellate Court considered the evidence exhaustively and found that the plain­tiffs had recently purchased the plot in the locality, but he did not exhibit his kabala before the Court. He purchased his homestead plots Nos. 2628 and 2629 in 1972. The suit was instituted on 24.9.74 "claiming easement right on the suit lands. In cross examination the plaintiffs admitted that a new path­way had been constructed through plot Nos. 2636, 2637, 2640, 2641, 2642 and 2643. In this view of the matter the Appellate Court below found that the plaintiffs must have constructed the pathway after purchase of the homestead. It was noticed that there was nothing before the Court to hold that the ven­dors of the plaintiffs enjoyed right of way by ease­ment over the suit land. The Appellate Court below then concluded "plaintiffs failed to prove that they enjoyed any right of easement over the suit land for the period prescribed by law." In this view of the matter, the appeal was allowed and the decree passed by the trial Court was set aside.<br/> <br/>6. The plaintiffs filed a second appeal along with Civil Revision No. 1163 of 1978. Both were disposed of by the same judgment. The only conten­tion that was made before the High Court Division was that the learned Additional District Judge acted illegally in reversing the decision of the learned Munsif without discussing evidence adduced by the respective parties. The High Court Division consid­ered that the plaintiffs were only recent purchasers and in the absence of clear evidence that their prede­cessors in interest used the alleged pathway in terms of section 15 of the Easement Act, the plaintiffs could not get the decree as prayed for. The learned Single Judge concluded that mere existence of a path­way or the fact of its user even for a long time does not give rise to a right of easement unless there is clear evidence to show that the right of way was ex­ercised peaceably and openly as of right and without interruption for a period of 20 years. In this view of the matter, the second appeal was dismissed along with the rule which was also discharged.<br/> <br/>7. Leave was granted to consider the conten­tion that the High Court Division wrongly assumed that the plaintiffs' suit was for declaration of their easement right over the suit lands and erred in law in applying of section 15 of the Easements Act. It was also submitted that the learned Single Judge erred in not holding that the suit path being a village path joining two other pathways on its two ends, no question of easement is involved herein.<br/> <br/>8. Mr. M.H. Khandker learned Counsel ap­pearing for the plaintiffs argued that the Courts below have made a wrong approach throughout by tak­ing the view that it was suit for easement under the Easements Act without noticing the prayer in the plaint that it was a customary right that the plain­tiffs were claiming. The point is attractive, no doubt.<br/> <br/>9. Easement Act, 1882 deals with customary easement. Easement Act does not deal with custo­mary right. It refers to customary rights no doubt, but that is for the purpose of making it abundantly clear that while the Act governs the former it has no concern with the latter. The Rajasthan High Court cited Fredrick Peacock who in his well known treat­ise on the law relating to Easements in British India (page 203) pointed out the real distinction between the two rights. It says:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Customary easements, as they are called in S.I8 of the Indian Easements Act, should be distinguished from the customary rights referred to in S.2 Cl. (b) of the same Act. The latter are rights arising by custom, but unappurtenant to a dominant tenement. No fixed period of enjoy­ment is necessary to establish these rights, but the custom must be reasonable and certain." (AIR 1965 Raj. 219).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The Easements Act was not applicable through­out India, but even then the principles were taken for deciding the cases on the Act to embody the princi­ple of equity and good conscience. See Shiv Dyal Vs; Ram Das AIR 1926 Lah. 473, Karinan Ilahi vs. Ghulam Mustafa AIR 1927 Lah. 492 and Mirza Ahmad Jan vs. Ghulam Hassan AIR 1944 Lah 417. In Nunia Mai vs. Maha Dev AIR 1962 Punjab 299 it was observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"There is an imposing array of authority for the view that in those parts of the country where Indian Easements Act is not in operation, there is no reason why the principles underlying the provisions of the Indian Act, should not be fol­lowed in so far as they embody the rules of equi­ty, justice and good conscience."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>What Mr. Khandkar canvassed was that the plaintiffs claimed customary right and not customary easement. Hence the Courts below while approach­ing the case made an erroneous decision by taking in view the principles of Easements Act. The submis­sion is devoid of any substance because it makes a distinction without any difference.<br/> <br/>10. Sections 2 and 4 read with section 18 of the Easement Act will clarify the position. In sec­tion 2 it has been made clear that a customary right is different from a customary easement and the Ease­ments Act does not at all deal with it. Again the def­inition of easement given in section 4 clarifies that an easement is always appurtenant to the dominant tenement and inseparably attached to it and cannot be severed from it. There can be no easement without dominant tenement and a servient tenement. Section 18 deals with customary easement and it says that easement may be acquired by virtue of local custom. But it is completely different from customary right because customary right is not an easement.<br/> <br/>11. On perusal of the three judgments, namely, trial Court, Appellate Court and the High Court Division it becomes clear what the plaintiffs claimed was customary right and not customary easement. Although we did not have the opportunity of going through the pleadings but this much appears to be the position that there was slight confusion in the Courts below as to what relief was claimed by the plaintiffs.<br/> <br/>12. Mr. M.H. Khandker, learned Counsel for the appellants, has made much of his grievance out of this apparent distinction but on scrutiny the sub­mission appears to be on a distinction without any difference.<br/> <br/>13. Although the learned Munsif decreed the suit he has not given his reasons for so doing in his judgment, the burden of his decision appears to be the report of the Advocate Commissioner, but how such pathway had become the public pathway and since when and how the custom was established is not found in the Trial Court judgment. The Appel­late Court below kept the plot number in view and found on evidence that the plaintiffs could at best make out a case of two year's user. It observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"It appears that the plaintiffs enjoyed the al­leged dominant heritage only for about 2 years before the institution of the suit."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Plaintiffs purchased the suit lands in 1972 and filed the suit in 1974 and curiously enough the plaintiffs did not produce their documents of pur­chase before the Court. The Appellate Court below observed, “The presumption is that the plaintiffs having been aware that document would go against their claim did not produce it before the Court. There is nothing before the Court to hold that their Ven­dors enjoyed any right of way by way of easement over the suit land." The learned Single Judge noticed that the plaintiffs were recent purchaser and conclud­ed that unless there was clear evidence to show that the right of way was exercised peaceably and openly from time immemorial no relief can be claimed.<br/> <br/>14. Analysis of the evidence aforesaid shows that notwithstanding confusion as to the nature of the relief that was claimed, the decision arrived at by the Appellate Court below was correct and that was affirmed by the High Court Division. Such confu­sion are the results of the pleadings and instances can be found in the decision of Parbhawati Devi vs. Mahendra Narain Singh AIR 1981Patna 133 and Harisadhan De vs. Radhika Prosad AIR 1938 Cal. 202. The casement being a right which is super-added to the ordinary common law incidents of the ownership of a dominant tenement and which connotes a corresponding burden on a servient tene­ment can only be created by grant or by statute. An apparent exception to this rule is a customary ease­ment. State of Bihar vs. Subodh Gopal AIR 1968 SC 281 it was noticed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"An apparent exception to this rule is a cus­tomary easement. But a customary easement is not an easement in the true sense of that expres­sion. A customary easement arises in favour of an indeterminate class of persons such as resi­dents of a locality or members of a certain com­munity, and though not necessarily annexed in the ownership of land, it is enforceable as a right to do and continue to do something upon land or as a right to prevent and continue to pre­vent something being done upon land. Sanction for its enforceability being in custom, the right must satisfy all the tests which a local custom for recognition by courts must satisfy."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>This being the nature of customary easement, the claim for customary right must be established on cogent grounds e.g. long-standing custom.<br/> <br/>15. The upshot of the discussion is that they failed to prove their customary right on evidence and the suit is liable to be dismissed for such reason. Precisely that was done by the High Court Division and the Appellate Court below.<br/> <br/>In the result, therefore, this appeal is dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
