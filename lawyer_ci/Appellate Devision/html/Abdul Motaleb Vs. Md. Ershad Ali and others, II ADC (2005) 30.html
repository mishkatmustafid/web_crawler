It was ini­tially a suit for simple declaration of title to the suit property measuring about .11 decimals in C.S. Plot No. 243, Khatian No. 22, present Dag No. 932, D.P. Khatian No. 199, Mouza Ibrahimpur within P.S. Dhaka Cantonment. It was, <em>inter alia</em>, stated in the plaint that the schedule property originally belonged to Md. Azimuddin, father of the plaintiff who had acquired .33 decimals of land from the disput­ed Plot No. 243 in a partition suit being Title Suit No. 46 of 1954 of the First Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka. The plaintiff's father while in possession of his share in the disputed Dag made a gift to the plaintiff of the suit land (.11 decimals) by a registered Hiba-Bill-Ewaz Deed 2.6.1982 and delivered posses­sion of the same to the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants were creating distur­bance to his peaceful possession of the suit land and were trying to dispossess him there from.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> On an application by the plaintiff for temporary injunction filed on 15.9.1985, the learned Subordinate Judge passed an order of <em>status quo</em> with notice to the defendants to show cause. The order of status quo was, however, vacated on 18.2.1987; it is alleged, in the absence of the plaintiff. The plaintiff filed another application for temporary injunction but during the pendency of the said application the defendants allegedly dispossessed the plaintiff from the suit land on 8.3.1987. In that situ­ation, the plaintiff filed an application on 28.3.1987 praying for amendment of the plaint seeking, inter alia, a decree for khas possession of the suit land. In that petition for amendment the correct names of defendants No. 3 and 4, who are respondents No. land 2 herein, were also given. The application for amendment was allowed.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a second application for amendment of the plaint on 8.6.1988 out of which the present appeal has arisen. In the said application the plaintiff, <em>inter alia</em>, alleged that inasmuch as he had already claimed recovery of possession upon payment of <em>ad valorem</em> court fee on the value of his claimed share in the suit plot, the decree would be more effective and beneficial if the entire land of the suit plot was included in the sched­ule and all the necessary persons were impleaded as parties in the suit and thereupon a prayer was made for a separate saham of the share of the plaintiff. Accordingly a prayer was added for partition of the suit plot No. 243 measuring in total .49 decimals and for a preliminary decree for .11 decimals being the share of the plaintiff at the first instance. In making the prayer for partition by amendment the plaintiff stated some more facts in the amendment petition which were not inconsistent with the facts already disclosed in the original plaint.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> Defendants No. 1, 3 and 4 by filing sep­arate written objections opposed the prayer for amendment mainly on the ground that the same would change the nature and character of the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> The learned Subordinate Judge by a short order dated 14.5.1989 allowed the amend­ment as prayed for and observed that the defen­dants were entitled to file additional written statement in view of the amendment of the plaint.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> Defendants No. 3 and 4 being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Subordinate Judge took a revision, Civil Revision No. 560 of 1989, to the High Court Division in which a Rule was issued and ultimately a Division Bench heard the matter. Two points were raised in the revision, 1) that the nature and character of the suit had been changed by the amendment and 2) that the order of the learned Subordinate Judge was not a speaking order, that is, no rea­son was given for allowing amendment of the follows: <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"The amendment of the plaint as allowed by the learned Subordinate Judge adding the words "Suit for parti­tion" has changed the nature and char­acter of the suit and as such the amend­ment allowed is not sustainable. Further the learned Subordinate Judge was required to assail (?) reason for passing the impugned order allowing the amendment but he has not done so. Therefore the impugned order of the learned Subordinate Judge cannot stand." </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>9.</strong> As already noticed the Rule was made absolute and the order of the learned Subordinate Judge set aside by the impugned judgment and order.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong> At the hearing of this appeal it was found that the learned Advocates of the parties were not fully posted with the facts of the case and the law on the subject. The learned Additional Attorney General, Mr. A.W. Bhuiyan who was present in Court arid Mr. Mahmudul Islam, learned Advocate, who was sent for, were requested to assist the Court in the matter which they did ungrudgingly and, we must say, with an admirable thoroughness by producing a large number of decisions govern­ing the question of amendment of plaint. Both of them submitted that having regard to the accepted and well-settled principles, to which, as are relevant, reference will presently be made and the facts of the case, the impugned judgment of the High Court Division rejecting the prayer for amendment cannot be supported. The High Court Division fell into an error, they submitted, by holding that the nature and char­acter of the suit were changed by making it also a "suit for partition" by amendment which can­not be allowed in that it failed to notice that the fundamental character of the suit was not changed by adding the relief for partition and that a general principle is that an amendment necessary for the purpose of determining the real question in controversy between the parties shall be made. Order VI rule 17 C.P.C. provides as follows:<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong> The Court may at any stage of the pro­ceedings allow either party to alter or amend his pleading in such manner and on such terms as may be just and all such amend­ments shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real question in controversy between the parties.<br/> <br/><strong>11. </strong>As to how the Court should exercise its power under the rule and what are the limitations in the exercise of such power, the judicial committee of the Privy Council in the case of <strong><em>Ma Shwe Mya Vs. Maung Mo Hnaung, AIR 1922 PC 249</em></strong> corresponding to <strong><em>ILR 48 Cal. 832</em></strong> observed as follows: <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"All rules of Court are nothing but provisions intended to secure the prop­er administration of justice, and it is therefore essential that they should be made to serve and be subordinate to that purpose, so that full powers of amendment must be enjoyed and should always be liberally exercised, but nonetheless no power has yet been given to enable one distinct cause of action to be substituted for another, nor to change by means of amendment the subject matter of the suit." </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>12.</strong> In the case of <strong><em>Managing Committee Vs. O. R. Chowdhury, 31 DLR (AD) (1979) 133</em></strong> this Court has laid down: <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"it is now well-settled that the amendment of the pleading could be allowed at any stage of the proceedings for the purpose of determining the real question of controversy between the parties, but it could not be allowed, if it changed the nature and character of the suit, or if the prayer for amendment had become barred by lapse of time and a right had accrued to the other side. But the latter principle can be departed from, if there are circumstances which outweigh the hardship and cause a prej­udice to the applicant. This principle has been well enunciated by the Privy Council in the case of <strong><em>Charan Das Vs. Amir Khan, A.I.R. 1921 P.C. 50</em></strong>, which has been followed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of <strong><em>Keramat Ali Vs. Muhammad Younus Haji P.L.D. 1963 (S.C.) 191=15 DLR (S.C.) 120</em></strong>. This Division in the case of <strong><em>Golam Hafez Meah Vs. Khadem Ali Meah 29 DLR 311</em></strong> has fully concurred with the views of the Privy Council and the Supreme Court of Pakistan." </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>13.</strong> There is one limitation in amending a plaint which is well recognized, that is, the nature and character of a suit cannot be changed by amendment. It is not, however, always correctly appreciated as to what is meant by a change, in the nature and character of the suit. For example, as in the present case, a simple suit for declaration of title to the suit land was converted following an alleged dispossession in the meantime, into a suit for recovery of posses­sion by amendment. Can it be said that by adding a new prayer for recovery of possession there has been a change, although apparently it may seem so, in the nature and character of the suit? The answer is obviously no. Has there been a change in the nature and character of the suit then by adding the prayer for partition which was allowed by the learned Subordinate Judge? The answer again must be no, because the principle is that the nature and character of a suit do not change so long as the fundamental character of the suit remains the same. A suit for declaration of title, recovery of possession and/or for partition is essentially based on a common claim of the plaintiff which may call for aforesaid different relief or reliefs in differ­ent situations. In the case of <strong><em>Ajiruddin Mondal Vs. Rahman Fakir, 13 DLR (SC) 191</em></strong> it has been observed that when, in a partition suit, the plaintiff is out of possession of a joint property the grant to him of separate possession of his partitioned share amounts really to two reliefs: i) Joint possession of his share and ii) the transformation of that joint posses­sion into separate possession of his partitioned share.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong> The adding of a relief for partition in a suit for recovery of possession may become necessary when there appears a possibility for the plaintiff of getting a decree for joint posses­sion. The nature of the suit does not undergo a change by making it a suit for partition also, because the claim of the plaintiff to the suit property basically rests on the same foundation.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong> In the case of <strong><em>Kasinath Das Vs. Sadasiv Patnaik, (1893) ILR 20 Cal. 805</em></strong> it has been held:  <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"an amendment, so long as it does not alter the character of the suit, may be allowed at any time before judg­ment. The restriction is only as to the nature of the suit; the law prohibits any such amendment as would change the fundamental character of the suit; for example, a plaint cannot be so amend­ed as to convert a claim based on con­tract into an action on tort. But an alter­ation in the relief does not alter the character of a suit." </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>16.</strong> On the same line but in a more lucid form it has been held in the case of <strong><em>E.K.S. Chettyar Firm vs.  Maung Mia, AIR 1933 Rangoon 247</em></strong>: <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"The one thing which must not be altered by an amendment is the funda­mental character of the suit; and I understand that the fundamental char­acter of a suit must refer to the foundation on which a suit is based and not the prayer in the plaint that determines its fundamental character." </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>17.</strong> The above two decisions and that of the Privy Council (Supra) were noticed by this Division in the case of <strong><em>Radha Krishna Vs. Dwarka Das, 36 DLR (AD) 253</em></strong> where in a suit originally for accounts of a partnership firm the plaintiff in order to overcome the bar of section 69 of the Partnership Act sought for an amend­ment of the plaint by way of substituting the aforesaid relief by making a prayer for dissolu­tion of the partnership firm which was rejected by the High Court Division in appeal. The ground for refusal was that the proposed amendment changed the nature and character of the suit. This Division set aside the judgment and order of the High Court Division and allowed the appeal.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong> In a madras case, <strong><em>Velammal Vs. C. Gounder, AIR 1971 Mad. 469</em></strong>, a suit was filed by the wife claiming maintenance from her hus­band and during the pendency of the suit the husband died and an amendment of the plaint was made seeking to claim partition of the deceased husband's property and separate pos­session of the share of the widow and her chil­dren. The amendment was opposed by the defendant on the ground that it would change the character of the suit as also the cause of action. The trial Court upheld the objection but the High Court set aside the same on revision. A judgment of the full bench of the same High Court, Sundaram Iyer in <strong><em>re. 1963-1 Mad LJ 133=AIR 1963 Mad. 217 (FB)</em></strong> was referred to in which it was held as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Broadly and generally stated, the rule is that the rights of parties have to be determined and pronounced upon as on the date of commencement of the 'lis' before the court. This is not how­ever a stubborn or inflexible rule and it has to give way in instances where, unless the subsequent events are con­sidered and taken into account, grave injustice would result or the decision of the court would become a mock­ery................The discretion of the court, under its inherent powers, to adjust the rights of parties on the basis of events happening after the starting of the action, is well recognized and accepted as a rule of justice, equity and good conscience. In some cases, it is almost the duty of the court to advert to subsequent events brought to its notice lest it should fail to do substantial jus­tice between the parties." </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>19.</strong> We shall refer to one more case among the large number of cases cited by the learned Additional Attorney General which is particu­larly apt in the circumstances of the present case. It is the case of <strong><em>Dundappa Vs. Mallappa</em></strong> decided by a learned Single Judge, <strong><em>AIR 1976 Karnataka 39</em></strong>. In that case the plaintiff filed a suit for injunction in respect of certain lands. The case of the plaintiff was that he was in joint possession with the defendants and the defen­dants were interfering with his possession and trying to exclude him there from. He obtained an <em>ad interim</em> injunction, but the same was vacated after hearing the defendants. The plain­tiff then came forward with an application to amend his plaint. He wanted to convert his suit for injunction into a suit for partition, by adding one more land and a house with movables in the plaint schedule. He claimed half share in all these properties. The defendants resisted the said application on the ground, among others, that if the amendment was allowed, it would change the character of the suit. Despite the objection the trial Court allowed the amend­ment stating that the defendants are not put to any injustice and are not deprived of their rights.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong> The High Court Division upheld the order allowing the amendment and observed by way of giving reasons that:"it is true that the cause of action for the injunction suit if differ­ent from the cause of action for a suit for parti­tion. It may also be stated that technically the nature changed into a suit for partition. But the purpose for which the plaintiff wanted the amendment should not be lost sight of. His averments in the suit for injunction were that he was in joint possession of the suit land with the defendants who are members of his family, who without any justification have been interfering with his said right. He, therefore, wanted an injunction to restrain the defendants from inter­fering with his right to be in possession. But the Court refused to grant an injunction on the ground that he could not ask for it against his co-owner. He then prayed for his separate share in all the family properties. It seems to me that he cannot be prevented from doing so. It is well recognized that a suit for injunction could be converted into a suit for possession, if the plain­tiff apprehends about his relief of injunction. The case on hand cannot be said to be different principle. The plaintiff herein really asks for possession of his separate share by claiming for partition."<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong> The learned Advocate for respondents No. 1 and cited only one decision, <strong><em>Saminada Piliai Vs. Subba Reddiar, ILR Madras Vol.1 (1876-78) 333,</em></strong> in support or his contention, which was not raised anywhere before, that his clients could not be joined in a suit for partition which had been brought about by amendment because they were alleged to be trespassers without any right and title.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong> In that decision the facts were that in a suit for partition of the joint Inam lands of a Hindu Family, a number of cultivating ryots were joined as defendants whom the plaintiffs sought to eject. The ryots pleaded that the lands had been reclaimed by their forefathers, that they and their fathers had been in possession ever since, and that they had thereby acquired a permanent right of occupancy. They also plead­ed that the suit was bad for multifariousness. It was held that the ryots were improperly joined as defendants in that suit. Evidently the princi­ple applied in that case is not available in the facts of the present case, more so, because the respondents themselves in their written state­ment, <em>inter alia</em>, stated that "fractional share of the plaintiff as alleged by him cannot be declared without partition.” The respondents claimed to have purchased .4 decimals of land in the suit plot No. 243 from one Shahadat Mia and Morshed Miah on 10.5.1973. In this pro­ceeding there is no question raised about mis-joinder of parties and the respondents have been in the suit as defendants from before the two amendments that were made by the plaintiff in his plaint. The submission of Mr. Zakir Hossain, learned Advocate, therefore, appears to be thoroughly misconceived.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong> The facts of the instant case presented not much difficulty because by adding a relief for partition in a suit for declaration of title and possession there was no alteration to the foundation of the suit and as such the fundamental character of the suit remained the same, there being thus no question of changing the nature and character of the suit. If the plaintiff had not prayed for partition in this suit, there was no bar for bringing another suit for the said purpose. One of the fundamental principals governing the amendment of pleadings being that all the controversies between the parties as far as pos­sible should be included in one proceeding to avoid multiplicity of proceedings, It is clear that the disputed amendment sought to be made in this case was wholly justified. The High Court Division completely ignored the principles as have been referred to above and without any application of mind to the facts of the case even, quite illegally interfered with the order of the learned Subordinate Judge.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong> The other consideration which weighed with the High Court Division that there was no reason assigned by the Subordinate Judge for his order, that it was not a speaking order, could not be a valid ground for interference in the facts  of the  present  case,  because,  as  Mr. Mahmudul Islam has rightly pointed out that, the order was otherwise supportable on merit and the High Court Division does not interfere with an order in revision unless the Subordinate Court has committed any error of law "resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of Justice." Not all errors of law call for interference unless the Court is satisfied that there has been an error in the decision also occasioning failure of justice. The order of the Subordinate Judge may have been a bad order and improper one not having given any reasons but before interfering with the same the High Court Division ought to have examined whether the same has resulted in an erroneous decision occasioning failure of justice which it has com­pletely failed to do. The impugned order is as bad as that of the Subordinate Judge. This is, however, not to say that such orders passed by the Subordinate Courts without any reason are to be viewed with any kindness. While allowing or rejecting an amendment of a pleading and for that matter while exercising any discretion under the law, the Court must give its reasons so that when the order is called in question, the higher Court may be in a position to see that there has been application of mind by the Court concerned and it aware of the principles involved in the exercise of its discretion. If the Subordinated Courts take pains only to write a proper order, as there was a lack of it in the present case, much of the congestion in the higher Courts in the form of revision etc. may be largely cut down. The case in hand is an example, the like of which are numerous, which shows how due to the absence of a few lines in the order of the trial Court justifying the amend­ment of the plaint on facts and authority has resulted in an unnecessary revision and then an appeal to this Court consuming about five years in the process. Our observations about the Subordinate Court apply <em>pro tanto</em> to the impugned judgment of the High Court Division also.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong> In view of the discussion above, we are of view that the High Court Division failed to apply the correct principles in the matter and wrongly interfered with the order of the Subordinate Judge. The appeal is accordingly allowed. The impugned judgment and order are set aside and the order of the Subordinate Judge allowing amendment of the plaint is restored.<br/> <br/>There will be no order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> <br/> </div></div></div>
