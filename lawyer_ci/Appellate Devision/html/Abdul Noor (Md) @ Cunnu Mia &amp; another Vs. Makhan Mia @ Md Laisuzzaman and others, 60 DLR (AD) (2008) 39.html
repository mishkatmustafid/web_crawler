The plaintiff instituted Title Suit No. 85 of 1983 in the 2nd Court of Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Sylhet praying for partition. The suit was subsequently transferred to the Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Artha Rin Adalat, Sylhet and renumbered as Title Suit No. 71 of 1991 stating, inter alia, that the land of SS Plot Nos. 7430, 7431 and 7432 were wrongly recorded in settlement records but, in fact, the total area of the land according to physical possession and measurement was 0.42 acres as described fully in the schedule of the plaint and the same was ejmali. The further case is, that Moulvi Mukti Miah, the predecessor-in-interest of the parties to the suit while owning and possessing the 16 annas share of the suit land died leaving behind two sons, Abdul Karim and Haji Abdul Majid and one daugh­ter, Aimona Bibi. Thus, each son inherited 2/5th share in the suit land and the daughter, Aimona inherited 1/5th share in the suit land. For the sake of convenience the said Haji Abdul Mazid went into possession of the whole of Dag No. 7430 and Abdul Karim came to possess the whole of Dag No. 7432 and the said three co-sharers owned and possessed Dag No. 7431 in ejmali. But the said Plot No. 7431 was wrongly recorded in the names of Haji Abdul Mazid and Abdul Kadir, son of Abdul Karim, in 12 annas and 4 annas shares respectively. Abdul Karim, while possessing Dag No. 7432 died leaving behind five sons, Abdul Kadir, Abdur Rahman, Abdul Latif, Abdul Aziz, Abdul Hamid and widow Mofizunnessa as his heirs. Thereafter, Mofizunnessa died leaving behind her sons as her heirs. Abdul Latif, son of Abdul Karim died leaving behind his only heir, Abdul Jalil, defendant No. 44. Abdul Aziz died leaving behind six sons, Abdus Salam, Abdus Sattar, Abdul Jabbar, Abdul Hannan, Abdus Sobhan and Abdul Mannan and two daughters, defendant Nos. 41 and 42, and a widow, Halima Khatun, defendant No. 43.<br/> <br/>Abdul Kadir died leaving behind his daughter defendant No. 45, Fatema Begum, two brothers, Abdur Rahman and defendant No. 45, Abdul Hamid. Abdur Rahman died leaving two sons, defendant Nos. 26 and 27 and one daughter defendant No. 28 and widow, defendant No. 29. The heirs of Abdul Karim had transferred by sale 11V2 decimals of land to defendant No. 24, Kamruzzaman. The heirs of Abdul Karim transferred to plaintiff-appellant No. 1 and defendant No. 1 by two separate deeds dated 20-11-1976 a little less than 4 decimals of land and, in view of the aforesaid transfers, the heirs of Abdul Karim had ceased to be co-sharers in the suit land. The further case of the petitioners is that Aimona Bibi transferred one ‘Pon’ of land out of her share to the plaintiff No. 1 by a sale deed dated 24-4-1949. Then she died leaving behind three daughters, defendant Nos. 30, 31 and Jaigun and brother, Abdul Mazid. Abdul Mazid inherited from his sister a little less than 2 decimals of land. Jaigun died leaving behind one son, defendant No. 32, and two daughters, defendant Nos. 33 and 34. The heirs of Jaigun and Jaigun's sisters, defendant Nos. 30 and 31, transferred to the plaintiff No. 1 by a sale deed dated 26-12-1982 land measuring a little less than 4 decimals whereupon the plaintiff went into physical possession of the said transferred land. Abdul Mazid transferred a portion of his share to Haji Ismail, husband of defendant No. 2. Haji Ismail transferred the said portion to his son, Yusuf, defen­dant No. 22. The defendant Nos. 22 and 23 had been in possession of the said land. Abdul Mazid while owning and possessing the suit land in ejmali died leaving behind three sons, plaintiff No. 1, defendant No. 1, and Abdul Hakim @ Damai Miah, three daughters, defendant Nos. 2, 3 and 4. Damai Miah's son, Dudu Miah, died in the lifetime of his father. Dudu Miah died leaving behind six sons, defendant Nos. 13-18, two daughters, defendant Nos. 19 and 20, and a widow, defendant No. 2. Abdul Hakim @ Damai Miah died leaving behind two sons, defendant Nos. 5 and 6, four daughters, defendant Nos. 7-10 and two widows, defendant Nos. 11 and 12. The plaintiffs have been thwarted in their efforts to make improvement in their share of the suit land owing to conflicting claims amongst the co-sharers. Hence is the suit.<br/> <br/>3. The defendant Nos. 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 22, 23, 47, 48, 49, 68, 69 and 2(Ka) contested the suit by filing written statement contending, inter-alia, that Mukti Miah was the original owner in possession of the suit land which fell in the category of homestead. Mukti Miah died leaving two sons, Abdul Karim and Abdul Mazid and one daughter, Aimona. Mukti Miah inducted his two sons into possession of demarcated portions of the suit land by way of gift during his lifetime. Mukti Miah did not give any portion of the suit land to his daughter Aimona Bibi but gave her share as gift at the time of marriage. Aimona Bibi did not claim any share in the suit land during her lifetime nor, did her daughters claim any share in the said property. Haji Abdul Mazid died leaving behind three sons, Abdul Hakim, the plaintiff No. 1 and Badsha Miah and three daughters, Samina, Kulsum Bibi and Saro Bibi. Samina Bibi transferred her share in the suit land to the present respondent No. 1 by a registered deed. Abdul Mazid and Abdul Karim were the recorded owners of Dag No. 7431 in 12 annas and 4 annas shares respectively. Abdul Mazid was the recorded owner of the whole of Plot No. 7430 and during his lifetime, Abdul Mazid transferred the whole of Plot No. 7430 to Haji Ismail Miah. The widow of Abdul Mazid transferred her 2 ‘Pons’ of land by way of gift to the present respondent No. 1. Abdul Mazid had a shoproom at Bandar Bazar and the said shop room was existent. The plaintiff and defendant No. 1 used to run business from the said shop room. Aimona did not claim any share in the suit land during the lifetime of Mukti Miah. The defendant No. 1 also prayed for the allotment of a separate saham in respect of his share in the suit property.<br/> <br/>4. The trial Court by judgment and decree dated 26-6-1993 decreed the suit in preliminary form and allotted saham to the parties. Being aggrieved, the defendant No. 6 preferred First Appeal No. 92 of 1994, the defendant Nos. 4 and 48 preferred First Appeal No. 32 of 1994 and defendant No. 22(Ka)-22(Cha) preferred First Appeal No. 47 of 1994. The High Court Division heard all the three appeals analogously and by the impugned judg­ment disposed of all the appeals as noticed earlier.<br/> <br/>5. Leave was granted to consider the submission that the High Court Division erred in law by relying exclusively on the Advocate Commissioner's Report which was not admitted in evidence and, as such, the finding based on the said report to the effect, that the parties to the suit were in exclusive possession of their shares in the suit land by an amicable partition was a perverse one and liable to be set aide and the next submission, that the plaintiff-appellants having been allotted a separate saham by the decree for partition and the contesting defendants having preferred appeals and that the contesting defendants' was not being a case against the plaintiff-appellants having no share in the suit land, the impugned judgment and decree dismissing the suit by the High Court Division has caused a disentitlement to the plaintiff-petitioner's right, title and interest in the suit land.<br/> <br/>6. We have heard Mr. AJ Mohammad Ali, the learned Counsel for the appellants and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/> <br/>7. It is undisputed that the suit land measur­ing 42 decimals belonged to Mukti Miah. It is also undisputed that Mukti Miah died leaving behind two sons, Abdul Karim and Abdul Mazid and one daughter, Aimona Bibi. The defendants' case is that Mukti Miah did not give any portion of the suit property to Aimona Bibi but gave her share as gift at the time of marriage. During her lifetime and after the death her heirs also did not claim any share in the suit property.<br/> <br/>8. The High Court Division disposed of all the three appeals and set aside the judgment and decree passed by the learned Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), in Title Suit No. 71 of 1991 and dismissed the suit, holding that "Most of the parties are residing in their respective building for a long time obviously amicably, but by filing the suit for partition, plaintiffs threw a stone in the still water causing claims and counter-claims. A court has an inherent power to refuse to divide the proper­ty by metes and bounds as the relief for partition is an equitable relief. Furthermore, Order XLI, rule 33, CPC runs as follows: <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"The appellate Court shall have power to pass any decree and make any order which ought to have been passed or made and to pass or make such further or other decree or order as the case may require and this power may be exercised by the court notwithstanding that the appeal is as to part only of the decree and may be exercised in favour of all or any of the res­pondents or parties although such respondents or parties may not have filed any appeal or objection." </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>9. The High Court Division further held, that the sketch map prepared by the Advocate Commis­sioner proves the factual position that the parties are possessing specific portions of the suit lands separately to the exclusion of all others.<br/> <br/>10. One of the salient features of a suit for partition is that it is between co-sharers and in respect of ejmali property.<br/> <br/>11. It is needless to mention here that an amicable partition is no partition in the eye of law. A co-sharer in possession of land less than his share is always entitled to pray for partition by bringing a suit in a court of competent jurisdiction and if his claim is proved he is entitled to get land partitioned through court. A co-sharer in possession of excess land than his share is bound to part with the same.<br/> <br/>12. Since the Advocate Commissioner did not depose before the trial Court nor the Court called him as witness, his report was not admitted in evidence. In that state of the matter, the High Court Division was not justified in relying on the same and reversing the judgment of the trial Court.<br/> <br/>13. In the facts and circumstances of the case and in view of the discussions made above, we are of the view that the reasoning given by the High Court Division for dismissing the suit are not at all tenable in the eye of law.<br/> <br/>All the appeals are, therefore, allowed without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
