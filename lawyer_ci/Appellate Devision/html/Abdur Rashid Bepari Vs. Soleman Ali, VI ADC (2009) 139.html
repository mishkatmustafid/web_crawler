Shahidul Huq, Advocate-on-Record-For the Respondents.<br/> <br/><strong>Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 1589 of 2006 </strong><br/>(From the judgment and order dated 14.05.2006 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.306 of 1996.)<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Md. Abdul Matin J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 14.05.2006 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.306 of 1996 making the Rule absolute and setting aside the judgment and decree dated 28.09.1995 passed in Other Appeal No.75 of 1994 upholding the judgment and decree dated 26.06.1994 passed in Other Suit No. 44 of 1994.<br/> <br/>2. The facts, in short, are that the plaintiff-petitioner filed the aforesaid Other Suit No.44 of 1994 against the defendant-opposite party for declaration that the reg­istered kabala deed No.3473 dated 01.08.1987 purportedly executed and reg­istered by the plaintiff-petitioner in favour of the defendant-opposite party was forged, void, inoperative and was not binding upon the plaintiff-petitioner on the allegations, inter alia, that the disputed land to the extent 16½  decimals covered by the aforesaid disputed kabala deed No. 3473 dated 01.08.1987 belonged to the plaintiff-petitioner and he was still in pos­session of the said land. But the defen­dant-opposite party created the disputed kabala by means of fraud in collusion with his own people to defraud the plaintiff-petitioner. The plaintiff-petitioner never sold the disputed land nor executed and registered the disputed kabala in favour of the defendant-opposite party on receipt of any consideration as alleged and he is still in possession of the suit land. The plain­tiff-petitioner for the first time came to know about the disputed kabala on 08.11.1993 corresponding to 23rd Kartik, 1398 B.S. when he was cutting his Amon paddy on the suit land the father of the defendant-opposite party came to resist him in cutting away his paddy and dis­closed about the disputed kabala.<br/> <br/>3. The defendant-opposite party contested the said suit by filing written statement denying the material allegations in the plaint contending, inter alia, that the plaintiff-petitioner executed and regis­tered the aforesaid kabala deed dated 01.08.1987 on receipt of consideration money from the defendant-opposite party tendering possession to him. Hence the suit was liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/>5. The trial court on consideration of the evidence on record and hearing the parties decreed the suit.<br/> <br/>6. The defendant preferred Title Appeal No.75 of 2004 and the appellate court allowed the appeal and set aside the judg­ment and decree of the trial court.<br/> <br/>7. The plaintiff then moved the High Court Division in revision and the High Court Division by the impugned judgment and order made the Rule absolute and set aside the judgment and decree of the appellate court and restored those of the trial court.<br/> <br/>8. As against the judgment of the High Court Division the defendant petitioner moved this petition for leave to appeal.<br/> <br/>9. We have heard the learned Advocate and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other paper on record.<br/> <br/>10. The learned Advocate submits that the High Court Division erred in law in reversing the finding of the court of appeal below without assessing the materials on record and simply relying on the finding of the trial court in respect of signatures of the plaintiff on the registered kabala and on other papers submitted before the court and as such the impugned judgment and order is liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/>11. It appears that the trial court examined and compared the signature of the execu­tant in the kabala dated 01.01.1987 with the admitted signature of the plaintiff peti­tioner in exercise of its power under Section 73 of the Evidence Act.<br/> <br/>12. The trial court held that signature appearing in the disputed kabala was not that of the plaintiff. It is now settled posi­tion of law that a court of law is competent to take recourse to Section 73 of the Evidence Act and if the court after com­paring the signature of the executant on the disputed kabala with the admitted sig­nature of the executant and comes to a finding that such signature is not of the executant such finding becomes a finding of fact and unless reversed by the court of appeal in accordance with law the High<br/>Court Division will not interfere with such finding on facts.<br/> <br/>13. In the instant case the High Court Division rightly held that comparison was done with authority of the court under Section 73 of the Evidence Act and the appellate court did not consider such find­ing of the trial court with reference to the evidence and the finding of the trial court on this point.<br/> <br/>14. We find that the High Court Division has not committed any illegality or error of law so as to warrant interference by this court.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
