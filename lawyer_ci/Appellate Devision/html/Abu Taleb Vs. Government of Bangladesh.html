The appellant was appointed asan Assistant Communication Engineer in the Civil Aviation Department on the 15th March, 1960 and itis his case that by dint of merit he was gradually promoted to the post ofDirector, Civil Aviation Authority. In 1985 the Government formed a corporatebody, namely, Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh, by abolishing theDepartment of Civil Aviation which was purely a Government Department, by CivilAviation Authority Ordinance, 1985 (Ordinance No. XXXVIII of 1985). About 2,000employees of the Civil Aviation Department were transferred by the Governmentto the newly created Authority with the condition that they will be governed bythe terms and conditions of service to be framed by the new Authority which hadthe effect of invalidating their service conditions which they enjoyed asGovernment servants. They formed a "Samannya Parishad" and launched amovement for withdrawal of the Ordinance of 1985. By Civil Aviation Authority(Amendment) Ordinance, 1985 (Ordinance No. LI of 1985) the transferredemployees were given the status of Government servants to be treated as ondeputation for the purpose of promotion, pension, retirement benefits, etc. Theformer Airport Development Agency picked up quarrels with the deputationistofficials on flimsy pretexts and on the 18th and 19th February, 1987 a numberof Airport Development Agency employees insulted a Senior Officer and a Staffof the former Civil Aviation Department which was duly reported to the Chairmanwithout any result. On the 19th February, 1987 they again started assaultingsome deputationist officials on duty which incident infuriated thedeputationists who went on a strike which continued up to the 24th February. Onthe 25th February the strikers resumed their duties. The appellant did not jointhe strike. He performed his duties throughout the period of strike. By aGazette Notification dated 1.3.87 the Government constituted a 4‑Member EnquiryCommittee (a) to determine the reasons of the incident that took place on the19th February, 1987; (b) to identify the persons responsible for the incidentand (c) to enquire into any other matter which the Committee thinks necessaryin connection with the incident and to submit its report by 23.3.87. Theappellant contended that the enquiry was held secretly and the appellant wasnever asked to show cause or appear before the Committee nor any charge wasframed against him. On the basis of the secret report the Government retiredthe appellant under section 9(2) of Act XII of 1974 on 2.1.88 malafide and incolourable exercise of power. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">3. Respondent No.2 the Chairman,Civil Aviation Authority in its written statement contended that the appellantwas retired under section 9(2) of the said Ordinance in the public interestwithout assigning any reason. He has been given all pensionary and otherbenefits and the order was not passed as a measure of punishment and, as such,it was not challengeable. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">4. Both the two Tribunals belowon perusal of the synopsis of the inquiry report annexed by the respondent heldthat there were enough materials before the President for his satisfaction thatin the public interest the appellant should be retired from service. Theappellant failed to prove his case of <i>malafide</i>, the Appellate Tribunalheld. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">5. Leave was granted to considerthe appellant's submission that the appellant may not have materials to prove <i>malafide</i>, as such, but the Appellate Tribunal was not justified in its views asto "public interest" within the meaning of section 9 (2) of the Actwhich requires to be decided upon an interpretation of the same as made by thisCourt in the case of <b><i>Mafizur Rahman Khan vs. Government of Bangladesh 34DLR (AD) 321</i></b>. There being no material on record before the Governmentexcept the secret report of the Enquiry Committee which the appellant had nooccasion to controvert the order of retirement cannot be justified as to havebeen passed in the public interest on the principles laid down in the saidcase. In any event the exercise of authority on the basis of the secret reportalone should be held to be a colourable exercise of power inasmuch as Courtsabhor secrecy and consider such act unfair. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">6.

Mr. Ahmed submits thatparagraphs 8 and 9 of the Synopsis of the Enquiry Report were submitted to thePresident for approval which the President did, resulting in the impugned orderof retirement. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">8. On a close reading of the saidparagraphs, Mr. Ahmed submits, it is crystal clear that the appellant wasretired not because his entire unblemished service record was taken intoconsideration or because his efficiency was found to be impaired or because theGovernment wanted to infuse new blood into the administration or because he wasfound to be unsuitable for his post, but because a "punitive measure"has to be taken by getting rid of him by way of retirement thereby avoiding adisciplinary proceeding which would have given him a chance to explain hisposition and clear his name. The impugned order of retirement contains nostigma against the appellant but the materials furnished by the respondent,namely, the synopsis of the Enquiry Report, which formed the basis of theaction taken against him reveals clearly that recourse to retirement was takenas an alternative "punitive measure" and not on a subjectiveevaluation of the appellant's service record. He then relies upon the followingobservations of this Division in the case of <b><i>Mofizur Rahman Khan vs.Government of Bangladesh34 DLR (AD) 321:</i></b> </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">"For, even in a case whereretirement is made under the amended law and the order expressly shows that ithas been made in the public interest, yet the Court shall have power to seewhether the order is in colourable exercise of power or is malafide or whetherit has been made by person by whom it was purportedly made, or the person whomade it had authority or jurisdiction to make the order." </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">9. The minimum, Mr. Ahmedsubmits, that the Government should have done is to go through the servicerecord of the appellant and find out whether the appellant was still useful inpublic service, but to take a unilateral action against him on the basis of asecret report which was not even made known to him and in which finding ofguilt has been made against him behind his back is tantamount to punishment inthe garb of retirement and is a colourable exercise of power having been passedfor a collateral purpose. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">10. Mr. Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan,learned Additional Attorney‑General on behalf of the respondent submits, on theother hand, that colourable exercise of power, in the words of <b>VR KrishnaIyer, J</b> in the case of <b><i>State of Punjab vs. Gurdial Singh AIR 1980(SC) 319</i></b> is as follows: </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">"Pithily put bad faith whichinvalidates the exercise of power‑sometimes called colourable exercise or fraudon power and often‑times overlaps motives, passions and satisfactions‑is theattainment of ends beyond the sanctioned purposes of power by simulation orpretension of gaining a legitimate goal. If the use of the power is for thefulfillment of a legitimate object the actuation or catalysation by malice isnot legicidal. The action is bad where the true object is to reach an enddifferent from the one for which the power is entrusted, goaded by extraneousconsiderations, good or bad, but irrelevant to the entrustment. When thecustodian of power is influenced in its exercise by considerations outsidethose for promotion of which the power is vested the Court calls it acolourable exercise and is undeceived by illusion". </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">11. He submits that in the factsof the present case from a perusal of the Enquiry Report as a whole it cannotbe said that the power was exercised to attain a goal different from the onefor which the power was entrusted.‑The impugned order is therefore not acolourable exercise of power, he submits. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">12. The provision of retiring aGovernment servant before the age of superannuation after an employee hascompleted a reasonably long period of service was there in the Fundamental Rule56(j) in British India. President Order No.14 of 1972 fixed the age of retirementof "public servant, meaning, <i>interalia,</i> Government servants, at 55 years. By Public Servants (Retirement)Act, 1974 the age of superannuation was fixed at 57 and section 9(l) made aprovision for optional retirement, to be exercised by the "public servant"after completion of 25 years of service and section 9(2) empowered theGovernment to retire from service a "public servant" who hascompleted 25 years of service "without assigning any reason". </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">13. In the case of <b><i>Dr.Nurul Islam vs. Bangladesh 33 DLR (AD) 201</i></b>, it was held that in theabsence of a minimum guideline or principle as to how the Government's power toretire a person should be exercised, section 9(2) is <i>ultra vires</i> Articles 27, 29 and 135 of the Constitution. By anamendment, Ordinance No. VI of 1981 promulgated on 28.7.91 section 9(2) wasamended with retrospective effect providing that the Government may retire apublic servant from service at any time after be has completed 25 years ofservice "in the public interest". </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">14. This retrospective amendmentwas found to be valid by this Court in the case of <b><i>Mofizur Rahman Khanvs. Government of Bangladesh, 34 DLR (AD) 321</i></b> but it was observed thateven after this amendment the Court shall have power to see whether the orderis in colourable exercise of power or is malafide or whether it has been madeby person by whom it was purportedly made or the person who made it hadauthority or jurisdiction to make the order. In fact, the retirement ofrespondent Borhanuddin Ahmed in another appeal in the same case under theunamended law, sought to be validated by the amended law, was held to beillegal as there was nothing on record to show that the order of retirement waspassed in the public interest. This judgment was passed on March 10, 1982. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">15. On the very next day, onMarch 11, 1982, in the case of <b><i>Habibullah Khan vs. Shah Azharuddin Ahmed,35 DLR (AD) 72</i></b>, this Division by a majority judgment dismissed theGovernment's appeal against an order passed by the High Court Divisiondeclaring the order of retirement of the respondent under section 9(2) of theAct as illegal, on the ground that the Government's affidavit­-in‑opposition inthe High Court Division itself claimed that section 9(2) "was applied inorder to impose exemplary punishment upon the petitioner" and that even inthe absence of any proof of malafide alleged by the writ petitioner, the orderof retirement was not otherwise sustainable on the materials on record. The twominority judgments of <b>Fazle Munim and Shahabuddin Ahmed, JJ,</b> (as theirLordships then were), in allowing the Government's appeal, took two mutuallydifferent views as to the extent of the Government's discretion in exercisingthe power under section 9(2). <b>Fazle Munim, J</b> opined that an order undersection 9(2) is justifiable, and if after presentation of materials by theGovernment, the Court is of the opinion that the impugned order has not beenpassed in the public interest, it can declare it to be so. <b>ShahabuddinAhmed, J</b> [who is the author‑Judge of the case reported in <b><i>34 DLR (AD)321</i></b>], opined that it is the Government who is the better judge todecide whether a Government servant should be retired in the public interestunder section 9(2). It is not possible, his Lordship held, for a Court to siton judgment over the government's action if from the facts disclosed it doesnot appear that the government's action was malafide or colourable exercise ofpower. Subject to these limitations, the discretion of the government in such amatter is absolute, his Lordship concluded. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">16. The principle enunciated inthe case of <b><i>Mafizur Rahman Khan vs. Government of Bangladesh, 34 DLR (AD)321</i></b>, relied upon by Mr. Ahmed, has not been differed from or dissentedto in the majority judgment of the later case, that of <b><i>Habibullah Khanvs. Shah Azharuddin Ahmed, 35 DLR (A D) 72</i></b>. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">17. In India various StateGovernments in implementing the provision of law in <i>pari materia</i> with our law, have issued, from time to time, various guidelines forconsideration of the Government or the Review Committee as to whether aGovernment servant should be retired or not after he has put in the requirednumber of years in Government service. The cases from the Indian jurisdictionare indeed cases as to whether the guidelines have been followed or not andoften, with respect, there are conflicting decisions of the Indian SupremeCourt as to the interpretation of these guidelines. For example, in the case of<b><i>Brij Mohan Singh vs. State of Punjab.AIR 1987 (SC) 948</i></b>, referred to by Mr. Ahmed, it was held that only the entriesof last 10 years in the annual confidential character roll should be seen andif there are any adverse remarks in the entries of last 10 years they must notonly be communicated but the representations made against them should beconsidered and disposed of before they can be taken into consideration. In alater case, <b><i>Baikuntha Nath Das vs. Chief District Medical Officer.Baripada, AIR 1992 (SC) 1020</i></b>, the Indian Supreme Court held that thesetwo propositions would give rise to practical difficulties and therefore itfollowed its two other contrary decisions, namely, the cases of <b><i>Union ofIndia vs. ME Reddy, AIR 1980 (SC) 563 and Union of India vs. JN Sinha, AIR 1971(SC) 40.</i></b> </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">18. What we have to remember inapplying the Indian decisions on cases of this nature is that while the variousState Governments of India have laid down certain guidelines to determine onwhat criterion or criteria a Government servant should be retired, theBangladesh law has stopped at saying merely that the Government can pass theorder of retirement "in the public interest". Those four words arethe only guidelines in our law, at least up to now. Nor is there anything inthe Public Servants (Retirement) Rules, 1975 to throw any light as to what arethe criterion or criteria in determining "public interest". AGovernment servant's entire service record may be absolutely without blemishbut in considering his further suitability in Government service, it may not benecessary to consider his service record. A single grave and serious incidentof far‑reaching consequence reflecting upon his further usefulness may beenough for the satisfaction of the Government that his continued utility inGovernment service is over, if he has crossed the 25‑year limit. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">19. We have perused the entiresynopsis as a whole, which it should be, including paragraphs 8 and 9 of thereport, as the two Tribunals below have done. It is stated therein, which isnot disputed, that, the radio telephone machineries of the Airport were madeunserviceable by a section of the deputationists and that there was a completestoppage of flights in and out of the country for six days owing to the strikewhich necessitated the intervention of the then President in the matter. Theenquiry was made after a Gazette Notification. It was, therefore, not a secretenquiry as alleged by the appellant. It was a public and open enquiry. Thepersons who were appointed to conduct the enquiry were all responsible highofficials of the Government against whom no complaint has been made by theappellant. The full Enquiry Report has been made available to us by the learnedAdditional Attorney‑General and it shows that far from keeping the appellant inthe dark, the appellant as Director of the Authority was interviewed andquestioned by the Enquiry Committee which also considered the appellant'sservice career. The Committee found that the appellant was the Chairman of the"Samannya Parishad" which was the originator of repeated agitationsand movements. The report was kept secret obviously because the EnquiryCommittee was dealing with a serious incident in a sensitive organisation inwhich a large number of employees were involved. Also the Capital's Airport isas much a concern of the Civil Aviation Authority as of the Bangladesh Air Forceand therefore the Report deserved a secret status. The Committee found that thetop officers of the Civil Aviation Authority who were deputationists had risenfrom the ranks and that they were found to be ill‑equipped to meet thechallenges of discipline and organisation of the newly‑created Authority and,on top of it, they had led and organised not only the incident in question butalso some other earlier movements and succeeded in realising some unduebenefits, including withdrawal of a departmental proceeding against theappellant through agitation. The Report also suggests some administrative re‑organisation.It was then up to the Government to decide whether in the face of this reportit should retire the appellant or institute disciplinary proceeding against himunder the Service Rules which the Government earlier made an attempt to do, butfailed because of agitation instigated by the appellant. If a Governmentservant is retired from service not on consideration of his service record buton consideration of an impartial report submitted by impartial high Governmentofficials after an open enquiry on an incident of an extremely grave nature,then it is for the Government to decide whether to take disciplinaryproceedings against the leading lights of the incident or to retire them in thepublic interest. The words "punitive measure" used in the EnquiryReport in paragraphs 8 and 9 are not a lawyers' draft, but laymen's expression.The final Authority who took the decision to retire the appellant was supposedto know that a retirement under section 9(2) of the Act is not a punishment atall. Reading the enquiry report as a whole we have no doubt in our mind thatthe Government took an overall view of the basic problems and issues involvedin the running of the Civil Aviation Authority as identified by the reportwithin its terms of reference and decided to retire the appellant in thegreater interest of providing better administrators in the top hierarchy of thenewly‑created authority as also to avoid similar incidents in future. We do notthink that under the special circumstances of this case it was a colourableexercise of power or a misuse or abuse of power, as urged by the appellant. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">20.
