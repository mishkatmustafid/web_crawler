Shortly, the case of petitioner Abul Hossain Khan, son of Sultan Khan is that he got lease of the plot No. 16/14, Block-C, Mohammadpur, Dhaka from the Government for a period of 99 years at a salamee of Taka 1701.00 in the year 1963 and the lease deed being No. 401 dated 10-01-67 was executed and registered in the year 1967 (Annexure A). That since taking lease the petitioner has been possessing the holding uninterruptedly and started living there after constructing building on the same by obtaining loan from the House Building Finance Corporation. The petitioner has mutated his name in the records of rights and has been paying rents and municipal taxes, etc. regularly. That the petitioner was Government Service holder and served as Ward Master of Rajarbag Police Hospital, Dhaka since 1956 continuously till his retirement on 14- 01.92. That there is no reason to include the building of the petitioner as abandoned property. The inclusion of the building of the petitioner in the list of abandoned building is without lawful authority as the said building is not an abandoned property as defined in President’s Order 16 of 1972.<br/> <br/>3. The petitioner has further submitted that he was completely unaware of the fact of inclusion of his building in the list of abandoned buildings. That on 24-01-93 only a man from Ministry of Works came to the house of the petitioner and informed him for the first time that his building in question had been included in the list of abandoned buildings published under section 5 of the Abandoned Buildings (Supplementary Provisions) Ordinance, 1985 in the official Gazette dated 23rd, September, 1986 in serial No. 37 at page No. 9761 (16) (Annexure-1). That now having no other efficacious or alternative remedy the petitioner has filed this writ petition.<br/> <br/>4. Kh. Mahbub Hossain, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner has made submission to the effect that the petitioner is all along in Bangladesh and he was a government servant till 14-01-92 and at present also he has been drawing his pension regularly and that all the papers including the lease deed, mutated Khatian Loan sanction letter, rent receipts, tax receipts, electricity bills, etc. submitted by the petitioners in the annexures to the writ petition very well prove petitioners title and also continuous possession in the building in question. The learned Advocate has submitted that the petitioners buildings can not be treated as abandoned property as defined in President’s Order 16 of 1972.<br/> <br/>5. The respondent No. 1 has contested this writ petition by filing an affidavit-in-opposition; the main Case of this respondent is that the present petitioner is not the original lessee Abul Hossain Khan. That the original lessee Abul Hossain Khan left building in question and his whereabouts is unknown since the independence of Bangladesh. That the present petitioner is an impostor of the original lessee Abul Hossain Khan. That on 27-01- 81 a survey team visited the building in question and did not find original lessee Abul Hossain Khan or the present petitioner residing in that building. That the petitioner came into possession of the building unlawfully at some subsequent time.<br/> <br/>6. The learned Advocate appearing for the contesting respondent has made submission mainly to the effect that the present petitioner is not the original lessee Abul Hossain Khan, and that the paper submitted by the petitioner in support of his claimed title and possession are subject to doubt. That the writ petition does not involve any question of law rather it involves matter of facts only and as such, the Rule is liable to be discharged.<br/> <br/>7. We have considered the submission of the learned Advocate for both the parties and also their respective Cases. In this Case it is admitted that the petitioner is, in possession of the building in question. The main question for determinator in this Case is whether the petitioner is the original lessee of the building in question or whether he is an impostor of original lessee Abul Hossain Khan.<br/> <br/>8. The contesting respondent though has contended that the petitioner is an imposter of the original lessee Abul Hossain Khan, but no iota of proof could be produced by him in support of this contention. Save and, except making a mere allegation to the effect that in 1984 the survey team did not find this petitioner in possession of the building in question the respondent did not or could not adduce any other fact or material before us to support his allegation that petitioner is not the original owner of the building, rather he is an impostor of the original owner.<br/> <br/>9. On the other hand, the petitioner has submitted sufficient documentary evidence to prove that he is the original lease holder of the plot in question namely, Abul Hossain Khan son of Sultan Khan. The attested photocopy of the lease dated 10 01-67 has been submitted by the petitioner as Annexure-A to writ petition. Both in writ petition and in affidavit-in-reply the petitioner has categorically stated that the original lease deed is lying with the House Building Finance Corporation as because the petitioner took loan and the said loan is not yet fully paid. The loan sanction letters and the book of payment of installments of that loan also have been submitted by the petitioner to substantiate his explanation as to non filing of original lease deed. It should be mentioned here that there is no specific denial of the fact that the petitioner had to deposit the original lease deed to House Building Corporation for the purpose of taking loan. Both in the writ petition and in affidavit-in-reply the petitioner has stated that he is a retired government servant and served as Ward Master of Rajarbag Police Hospital Dhaka from 1956 till his retirement on 14-01-92 and he is still getting his pension from the government. The retirement letter of the petitioner (Annexure-H) and the pension book have been submitted and these prove that the petitioner Abul Hossain Khan is actually a retired government servant. This fact of petitioner’s being a government servant tells strongly against the respondents allegation that the petitioner is an impostor of the original lessee Abul Hossain Khan.<br/> <br/>10. The learned Deputy Attorney-General for the respondent has also pointed out that the original lessee and his signature in the lease deed is in English while the present petitioner put his signature in writ petition, vakalatnama, etc in Bengali. Learned lawyer’s contention is that fact supports respondents’ Case that the present petitioner is not the original lessee. But contention also of the learned lawyer is not found tenable while the petitioner (who is personally present in Court) being directed by us, put his signature on a paper in English. We have carefully examined this signature of the petitioner taken Court with the signature of the lessee put in lease deed the Annexure-A and found that both signatures are same and identical. This is no doubt another important fact which also strongly tell against the respondent’s allegation that petitioner is an imposter of original lessee.<br/> <br/>11. However, it appears that saves and except the mere alleged fact that the petitioner was not found in the building in question while a team went there in the year 1984 there is n fact of circumstances or evidence before us to respondent’s Case that the petitioner is an imposter of original lessee. It should be mentioned here that the respondent could not substantiate this fact also that the petitioner was not found in building in question by the survey team in 1984 by submitting the relevant survey report or any materials. However even if this alleged fact is as true then also this mere fact that the petitioner was not found by the survey team in the building in question in the year 1984 can not be basis for holding the petitioner as an imposter of the lessee of the building specially in the circumstances where there are sufficient materials (as discussed above) before us to prove that the petitioner is the original Abul Hossain Khan and he is all along in Bangladesh serving as a government servant since 1956 till his retirement in 1992. So, considering these above facts, circumstances and before us, we find that the petitioner is the lessee of the building in question and as such, it can not be treated as abandoned property as defined i President’s Order 16 of 1972. The inclusion o petitioner’s building in question in abandon properties list under section 5 of Abandoned Buildings (Supplementary Provisions) Ordinance 1985, therefore, has been without lawful a the contesting respondent could not produce before us the official record or anything else to prove his Case that petitioner was served with notice to surrender the possession of the buildings in question as abandoned buildings. On the other hand, the petitioner by swearing affidavit has stated that he was not served with any such notice and was not aware of the fact of inclusion of his buildings in the list of abandoned properties before 24-01-93. So in these circumstances we find that the petitioner now having no other alternative remedy is entitled to file this writ petition. In the result, the Rule is made absolute without an as to costs. It is declared that the inclusion of holding No. 16/14 Block Mohammadpur, Dhaka in the list of abandoned building in serial No. 37 at page 9764 (16) in the official Gazette dated 23rd September, 1986 published under section 5 of the Abandoned Buildings (Supplementary Provisions) Ordinance 1985 (Annexure-1) to the writ petition) has been made without any lawful authority and is of no legal effect. The respondents are directed to delete the building in question from the list of abandoned buildings.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
