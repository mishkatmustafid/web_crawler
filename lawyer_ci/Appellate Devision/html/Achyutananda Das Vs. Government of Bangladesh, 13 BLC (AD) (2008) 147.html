The facts of the case are that the petitioner is a citizen of Bangladesh by birth. The petitioner was born in 1927 and he was living in the homestead in plot Nos. 839 and 840 of Khatian Nos. 257 and 256 of Mouza Sylhet Municipality at Mahalla Roynagar in the Sylhet Town. The petitioner passed the matriculation examination in the year 1943 and passed intermediate in the year 1946. While he was working in Hardeo Glass Factory in Dhaka he left for the United King­dom in 1957 to secure higher study. In the United Kingdom he got a job in the British Railway and thereafter in London Transport. In order to improve his efficiency he got admit­ted into the Institute of Transport, an institu­tion incorporated by the Royal Charter in 1926 and after 4 years of his study he passed the Associate Membership Examination in May, 1961 and he was given the Associate Member­ship of the Institute of Transport on 12 March, 1962. The petitioner continued to serve in the London Transport and retired from service in 1989. The petitioner was granted citizenship of United Kingdom in December, 1965 and he got British Passport in 1966 as a citizen of United Kingdom. At the same time he is also a citizen of Bangladesh holding dual citizenship. The petitioner came to Bangla­desh on the 1st August, 2001 and went to Sylhet to see his ancestral house and to renovate it and to reside there at the end of his life, and to his utter surprise he came to learn that the property has been declared as enemy property, now vested and non-resident property and the Government has taken up the management of his ancestral property. Thereafter, he instructed one of his relations to collect the papers regarding the property and left for United Kingdom on the 8th August, 2001. The petitioner again came to Bangladesh on the 15th January, 2002 and he made a prayer to the Deputy Commissioner, Sylhet on the 21st January, 2002 for release of the property from the list of vested property stating that the petitioner was never an enemy subject nor he was a citizen of any country with which the erstwhile Pakistan was at war and, as such, treating his property as enemy property or ves­ted property is illegal and without jurisdiction.<br/> <br/>3. Upon the said application to the Depu­ty Commissioner (Rev.) Sylhet Miscellaneous Case No. 40/2001-2002 was started and the Additional Deputy Commissioner called for a report from the Assistant Commissioner (Land), Sylhet, Sadar upon inquiry and the inquiry was held and the Assistant Officer, Land, Chak Sultanpur Union, Land Officer, Sylhet Sadar submitted a report to the effect that the land belonging to the petitioner com­prising plot No. 840 has been declared an enemy property in VP Case No. 24/66-67 and the land of plot Nos. 838 and 839 has been dec­lared an enemy property in VP Case No. 313 / 66-67 and those were leased out to the lessees and the Government is in possession of the said land. The Assistant Commissioner (Land), Sylhet having received the aforesaid inquiry report forwarded the1 same by his memo dated 5-4-2003 to the Upazila Nirbahi Officer, Sylhet Sadar and in his forwarding the Assistant Commissioner opined that the petitioner came to Bangladesh after retirement and he never left the country for good, but in view of the promulgation of Awc©Z m¤úwË cÖZ¨c©Y AvBb, 2001 (sic) the property cannot be released. The Additional Deputy Commis­sioner (Rev.) on the basis of the inquiry report rejected the prayer of the petitioner for release of the land from the list of enemy property (now vested property) by his order dated 24-4-2003. The petitioner claims that the petitio­ner's father purchased the property and after his death the petitioner and his elder brother inherited the said property. During last settle­ment operation the land has been recorded in the name of Sachidananda Das, the elder brot­her of the petitioner and the petitioner Achyutananda Das in equal share in the property, the petitioner having 0.79 acres of land in plot No. 840 and 0.7 ½ decimals of land in plot No. 838 0.25 ½ decimals of land in plot No. 839. Thus, the petitioner owns in total 0.53 decimals of land comprising of the aforesaid plots. As the brother of the petitioner, a co-sharer, died in India, the petitioner does not make any claim in respect of his brother's share.<br/> <br/>4. The Chairman of the Sylhet Pourashava issued a certificate to the effect that the petitioner is a citizen of Bangladesh. In the supplementary affidavit the petitioner has annexed the photocopy of the passport showing his dual citizenship and also a copy of the voters' list of 2002 showing that the peti­tioner's name was registered in the voters' list which was published on 25-11-2002.<br/> <br/>5. Mrs. Sufia Khatun, Advocate-on-Record appearing for the petitioner, submits that the High Court Division erred in passing the impugned judgment and order that there was no material before the High Court Divi­sion to show that the petitioner was ever an enemy subject or alien enemy within the meaning of Defence of Pakistan Rules, 1965 and, as such, the impugned judgment and decree are liable to be set aside; that the peti­tioner being a citizen of Bangladesh, he having not denounced his citizenship at any point of time, the inclusion of his property in the list of enemy property and keeping the same as vested property is illegal but the High Court Division failed to consider this aspect which has caused miscarriage of justice; that the peti­tioner was never an "enemy" as defined in Rule 161 or "enemy subject" as defined in Rule 169 of the Defence of Pakistan Rules, 1965 as he never went to India when the Defence of Pakistan Rules was in force and, as such, the enlisting of the property belonging to the peti­tioner as enemy property and treating the same as vested property at present is illegal but the High Court Division erred in law in not considering this vital aspect and, as such, the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division is liable to be set aside; that the petitioner has inalienable right to enjoy his property as enshrined in Article 42 of the Cons­titution of Bangladesh and, as such, enlistment of his property as enemy property and continuing to treat the same as vested property is violative of Article 42 of the Constitution and the High Court Division failed to consider this important aspect and thus impugned judg­ment and order is liable to be set aside; that the High Court Division held that the petitioner filed writ petition at a belated stage, but failed to consider that the petitioner was absent from the country and used to reside in United Kingdom in course of his employment there and soon after his return in August, 2001 in Bangladesh for the first time he has taken ap­propriate steps to get back his ancestral properties and he is not guilty of any laches or inaction and, as such, the impugned judgment and order is liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/>6. The High Court Division made a wrong approach to the case and held that the petitioner was to establish his title without considering that the petitioner's title was denied by the respondent and that he has title in the suit land is an admitted fact and that the respondents also did not deny the fact that the petitioner was never an enemy subject and thus erred in the impugned judgment which is liable to be set aside; that the High Court Division committed a serious error in holding that the question of ownership of the property is to be decided by the Civil Court without properly appreciating the case of the petitioner that the SA record has been prepared in the name of the petitioner in respect of the land as enlisted and, as such ,the ownership was not in dispute and only the question was, that whether the petitioner ever became enemy subject and the respondents have not asserted so and in that view of the matter the impugned judgment and order is liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/>7. It appears from the record that admit­tedly the property in question belonged to two brothers. The elder brother went to India before 1965 and the petitioner was also absent in the area since 1965 and since the elder brother died as enemy in Indian territory the Government initiated two VP cases immedia­tely after the Defence of Pakistan Rules was promulgated and treated the property as enemy property. The petitioner had not been in possession of the property and the Govern­ment having treated the property as enemy property or vested property allotted the property to the different allottees. The peti­tioner claims that he is a co-sharer of the property which was taken over by the relevant authority as vested property initiating VP cases. The property is admittedly in posses­sion of the vested property authority. Unless the petitioner establishes his title over the land and recovers possession by a decree obtained in competent Civil Court no effectual remedy can be obtained by the petitioner. The question of ownership of the petitioner in the property and his citizenship could only be determined by a competent civil Court in a properly framed suit. The petitioner during the last more than 45 years never looked after the property, never made any claim before the authority before an application was made on 21-1-2002 to the Deputy Commissioner, Sylhet and consequently, there has been great laches on the part of the petitioner which will disentitle the petitioner to come before this Court to invoke writ jurisdiction.<br/> <br/>In view of the above, we find no sub­stance in the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the leave petition is dismis­sed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
