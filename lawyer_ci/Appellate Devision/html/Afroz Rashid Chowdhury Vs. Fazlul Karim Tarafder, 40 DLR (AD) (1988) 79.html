The plaintiff claimed the suit land by virtue of purchase by a registered kabala dated 30th Falgoon 1353 B.S. corresponding to 14th March, 1947 A.D. At the time of purchase Vender's guard, Hasumia, was in possession, but as he refused to deliver the possession, he filed Title suit No. 5 of 1950 and took deliver) of possession through court on 27th May, 1951 in execution of a decree for eviction, passed in that suit.<br/> <br/>3. Thereafter the plaintiff possessed the suit land through adhi-bargadar, defendant No. 10. The plaintiff a practising Mukhtear, at Habigang went home in Magh 1360 B.Sk. and came to know that defendant No. 10 had left the suit village in the last part of Poush, 1360 B.S. for another village. Then he decided to let out the suit land in adhibarga to Marfatullah. Marfatullah informed the plaintiff towards the end of Falgoon 1360 B,S, that defendants Nos.1-4 and the father of defendants Nos.5-7 got the suit land ploughed by defendants Nos.8 and 9 and they did not allow him to possess the suit land. The plaintiff filed the suit on 3rd Baisakh 1372 B.S. corresponding to 16th April, 1965.<br/> <br/>4. The present appellant, defendant No.2, alone contested the suit. His case is that the suit land is the ancestral property of defendants Nos.1-7; that they have possessed the same from the nine of their ancestors and that the decree in Title suit No.5 of 1950 is collusive, fraudulent and not binding upon the defendants.<br/> <br/>5. The trial court rejected the defendant's claim of title by inheritance, found the plaintiffs title in the suit land, but dismissed the suit by holding that the plaintiffs title had been extinguished by more than twelve years' adverse possession by the defendant from Paush,1359 B.S. On appeal that decision was reversed and the suit was decreed on a finding that even if adverse possession of the defendants started, at the earliest, from 30th Chaitra,1359 B.S. still the suit would be within the period of less than twelve years. The learned Single Judge of the High Court Division upheld the decision of the appellate court below.<br/> <br/>6. Leave was granted to consider whether the admission of the plaintiff in his plaint that his previous bargadar had abandoned the land in the last part of Poush, 1360(B.S) that the defendant had, already forcibly ploughed the land in the last part of Falgoon that year and disallowed his subsequent bargadar to take possession of the land lends support to the defendant's claim that his adverse possession started from the last part of Poush, 1360(B.S) and the suit filed on 16th April ,1965 was beyond the period of limitation of twelve years. This leave was granted considering Ground No.l in the petition for special leave to appeal.<br/> <br/>7. The learned Counsel for the appellant having found that the terms in which leave was granted would be of no avail to the appellant submitted at the very outset that in this ground No.1 of the leave petition the year "1359" B.S was wrongly typed as 1360 B.S. We find no substance in this submission as in the plaint it was clearly stated that the plaintiffs bargadar had abandoned the suit land in last part of Poush”, 1360 B.S. The defendant appellant would have no case if he relies on the plaintiff’s admission of the abandonment of the suit land in the last part of Poush 1360 B.S. corresponding to January, 1954 A.D. as the suit filed on 16th April, 1965, would definitely be within time.<br/> <br/>8. Finding himself in a predicament, the learned Counsel for the appellant relied upon Ext. D, an order of the Revenue Officer dated 25.3.53. By this order the defendants were shown in the Record-of-Rights to be "in forcible possession" of the land of the plaintiff. The learned Advocate for the appellant submitted that in view of the fact that Ext. D, the record of rights, was corrected on the plaintiff's own petition by directing that the disputed plots 1310,1320, and 1342 be recorded in his name, and at column No. 23 the names of the defendants be recorded as in forcible possession from 1359 B.S. and as that order was passed on 25th March, 1959 corresponding to 11th Chaitra 1359 B.S. the learned Munsif for good reason observed that it could not be held that the plaintiffs bargadar left the suit village later than in Poush 1359 B.S. It is contended that, as the appellate court did not consider the material facts and circumstances on which the trial court based its decision, the finding of fact as to the starting point of dispossession by the appellate court was not binding in second appeal. In support of this contention reliance is placed on A.H. Md. Ismail vs. Sachidananda Bhattacharjee 40 C.W.N.769.<br/> <br/>9. Mr. Azizur Rahman Chowdhury, learned advocate for the respondent, has pointed out that Ext.D was not mentioned in the written statement and that it| was produced for the first time when evidence was about to be closed. He has submitted that the lower appellate court rightly held it to be a suspicious document. The order dated 25th March, 1953 (Exhibit-D) was not a record of rights. It was an order passed by the Revenue Officer in an objection case filed by the plaintiff. The learned Counsel for the appellant also took exception to the following observation of the learned Subordinate Judge. "This order was passed on the basis of the opinion of the revenue authority and the contesting defdt did not take any step to prefer appeal disputing the fact that they came into possession of the suit land forcibly in 1359 B.S." It is contended that it was the plaintiff who should have preferred an appeal against the-order dated 25th March, 1953. As that order of the Revenue Officer did not support the defendants' case that the suit land was their ancestral lands but that they were merely "on forcible possession" therein, the learned Subordinate Judge, we find, rightly made the above remark. From that it tan not be said that the onus was wrongly placed on the defendant.<br/> <br/>10. On behalf of the appellant it is further contended that the court of appeal below made out a new case by finding that the plaintiff’s bargadar possessed the suit land upto 30th Chaitra 1359. B.S. vide the kabuliyat Ext.5 (a) and that if defendants entered in to the suit land even on 30th Chaitra 1359 B.S. i.e. 13th April, 1953 A.D. the twelve years running from that date ended on 13.4.1965 A.D. and as the Civil Court was closed from 12th April, 1965 to 15th April, 1965 A.D. on account of Eid ul Azha and the plaintiffs suit filed on the reopening day of Civil Court on 16th April, 1965 was not barred by limitation.<br/> <br/>11. This finding of the court of appeal below cannot be construed as a making of a new case as the kabuliyat Ext. 5(a) executed by the plaintiffs bargadar defendant No. 10 clearly indicates that the barga agreement was in force till 30th Chaitra, 1359 B.S. Defendant No. 10 was impleaded in the suit but he did not file any written statement though his name was found in the written statement filed by the present appellant and afterwards penned through. The trial court held that defendant No. 10 and Hasur Bap were in the camp of defendant No. 2. The court of appeal below observed that no disinterested witness came forward to prove possession of the defendant and held that the defendants 1-7 in collusion with defendants 8-9 dispossessed the plaintiff from the suit land just at the fag end of the month of Chaitra 1359 B.S. The court of appeal below further considered that D.W.1 stated in his examination in chief that he did not know the schedule of the plaint and in cross examination he further stated that he had no objection if the plaintiff would get a decree with regard to the suit land.<br/> <br/>12. The question of limitation is a mixed question of fact and Law. In this particular case after considering the evidence both oral and documentary the court of appeal below, the last court of fact came to a finding that the defendants dispossessed the plaintiff from the suit land just at the end of the month of Chaitra 1359 B.S. but it did not accept the plaintiffs case of dispossession from 22nd Falgoon 1360 B.S. Non-acceptance of the plaintiffs date of dispossession by the appellate court and the latter's finding that the defendants dispossessed the plaintiff from the suit land later, at the end of 30th Chaitra, 1359 B.S. would not amount to making out a new case by the appellate court.<br/> <br/>13. In the facts and circumstances of the case the learned Single Judge rightly refused to interfere with the finding of the last court of fact. The appeal is dismissed with costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
