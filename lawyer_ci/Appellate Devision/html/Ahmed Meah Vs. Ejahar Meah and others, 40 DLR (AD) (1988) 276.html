Afzal J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This appeal by special leave arises from judgment and order dated 11 March, 1984 passed analogously in Civil Orders No. 61 and 62 of 1984 by a Single Judge of the High Court Di­vision (Chittagong Bench) summarily rejecting two revisional applications of the appellant filed under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/> <br/>2. Facts of the case, briefly, are that landlords-respondents No. 3-10 instituted Rent Suits No.15 and 16 of 1958 for recovery of arrear rent of 1362 B. S. against Rashid a Khatun (deceased), mother of the ap­pellant relating to two separate holdings held by said Rashida Khatun. The Suits were decreed ex-parte and the holdings were put to sale in Rent Execution Cas­es No.101 and 103 of 1958 respectively. Respondent No.1 Ejahar Meah purchased both the holdings on 20-5-58 at separate auction sales and the sales were duly confirmed.<br/> <br/>3. Appellant filed Miscellaneous Judicial case Nos. 37 and 38 respectively of 1967 for setting aside the said sales under Section 173/174(3) of the B. T. Act on 19-4-67 on the ground that decree was obtained fraudulently and there were material irregu­larities and/or fraud in publishing and conducting the sale. It was also contended that there was no arrear of rent for the period in question and that respondent No. 2 father of the appellant at the instigation of ap­pellant's step-mother managed to auction purchase the holdings collusively in the benami of respondent No.1 who is the brother of the husband of the daugh­ter by the previous husband of the wife of Respon­dent No. 2.<br/> <br/>4. Respondent No.1 contested the cases denying all the allegations and asserting that the applications were not maintainable and barred by limitation, that the appellant knew about the sales and that there was no material irregularity in publishing and conducting the sales.<br/> <br/>5. The trial Court and the appellate Court concurrently found that the applications for setting aside the sales were barred by limitation. The trial Court further held that the petitions were not maintainable as no case had been filed by the appellant for setting aside the decrees in execution of which the impugned sales took place. The appellate Court concurred with the said finding and further held that irregularities in publishing and conducting the sales could not be well-proved by the appellant. Thus the Miscellane­ous Cases were dismissed and this was affirmed in appeal.<br/> <br/>6. The High Court Division by the impugned order summarily rejected the two revisional applica­tions filed against the judgment and order passed by the Subordinate Judge in appeal affirming those of the trial Court.<br/> <br/>7. Leave was granted to consider the submis­sion whether the courts below erred in failing to con­sider the question as to whether there was any fraud and material irregularity in publishing and conduct­ing the sales and whether the courts below ought to have noticed Ext.3 and 3(a) which show that there was no arrear of rent for the period in question and further whether the High Court Division erred in ob­serving that non-consideration of the said documents was not an illegality vitiating the relevant judgment.<br/> <br/>8. It has been noticed that there has been a con­current finding made by the courts below that the ap­plications for setting aside the sales (Misc. Case 37/ 67 and 38/67) are barred by limitation and this has been approved by the High Court Division. Indeed it does not appear from the impugned judgment of the High Coir Division that the concurrent finding as to limitation was challenged before it on any ground. Nor does it appear that the finding as to non-maintainability of the applications also was at all challenged in the High Court Division. In view of the findings as to limitation and non-maintainability the court was not at all required to consider the appli­cations on merit as to whether there was fraud and material irregularity in publishing and conducting the sales.<br/> <br/>9. Mr. Siddique Ahmed Chowdhury, learned counsel for the appellant, has sought to contend that the courts below ought to have considered the appli­cation on merit upon which the question of limita­tion depends. It is difficult to follow his argument, because the merit of the case could not be considered before deciding the question of limitation as that would amount to putting the cart before the horse.<br/> <br/>Mr. Chowdhury in course of his submission has stressed that Exts. 3 and 3(a) show that there was no arrear rent due and the holdings were sold at a shock­ingly low price. According to him the proceedings were apparently fraudulent and if fraud was found on consideration of merit of the case relief should have been granted in spite of the delay or bar of limitation as court cannot allow a fraud to stand. In support of his submission he has referred to the following deci­sions; 59 C.W.N. 1082, 11 DLR (PC) 143, 9 DLR 601 and 13 DLR 101.<br/> <br/>10. Going through the said decisions it is found that not only the facts of the said cases are different but they also do not support Mr. Chowdhury's prop­osition. In the Calcutta Weekly Note case there was no question of limitation and the decision relates to interpretation of the second proviso to Order 21 Rule 90 C.P.C. This decision has relied upon a Privy Council case which is reported in 11 DLR (PC) 143. In the 9 DLR case an order of the House Rent Con­troller which was said to have been obtained by prac­tising fraud upon him was at issue. In the High Court objection to the application for review of the said order was raised, inter alia, on the ground of limitation. The learned Single Judge observed that when a fraud is committed on a Court, the Court has inherent power to set it right and no order obtained by practising fraud on the court and on the parties should be allowed to stand on record. In the case re­ported in 13 DLR 101 there was an application under Order 21 Rule 90 C.P.C. for setting aside the sale on the ground that there were fraud and material irregularity in the publication and conduct of the sale. The decree-holder auction-purchaser, inter alia, pleaded the bar of limitation. The trial Court, besides other, upheld this plea but the Subordinate Judge on appeal held that the application was filed within time from the date of knowledge of the judgment-debtor and the application was thus not barred by limita­tion. The learned Single Judge observed on the ques­tion of limitation that in a case to have the sale set aside under Order 21 Rule 90 C.P.C on the ground of fraud in the publication and conduct of the sale, the judgment-debtor must have knowledge not mere­ly of the fact of sale but a clear and definite knowl­edge of the facts which constitute the fraud before time can run against him.<br/> <br/>11. It will be seen that in the facts and circum­stances of the present case the principles referred to in the said cases nave no manner of application. The appellant could not prove by cogent evidence that he could not file the applications within time because of fraud or that his applications were within time from the date of his knowledge of such fraud. In the present cases the disputed sales took place on 20-5-58 and it has been found that the appellant came to know about the sales on 26-4-59 and 4-5-59 but he filed the applications for setting aside the sales in 1967. The applications being thus clearly time-barred, the courts were not obliged to consider the case on merit whether there were irregularities in conducting the sales and the holdings were sold at a shockingly low price etc. Even so the appellate Court has recorded a finding on merit also. As re­gards the claim that (here was no arrear rent due the High Court Division rightly pointed out that in the Misc. Cases before the Executing court, the Execut­ing court could not go behind the decree and the de­crees themselves could not be challenged as fraudu­lent as done in the instant cases. Further it has been rightly pointed out that Ext3 and 3(a) were not even relevant for the purpose of coming to a decision whether the sales were brought about fraudulently and thus non-consideration of those documents by the courts below could not be treated as an illegality vitiating their judgment. Mr. Chowdhury could not and as a matter of fact has not disputed the concur­rent findings as to limitation and non-maintainability. That being so, it is clear that the points sought to be raised by Mr. Chowdhury cannot proceed further, rather at all.<br/> <br/>12. For the reasons stated it is found that the High Court Division committed no error in rejecting the revisional applications summarily.<br/> <br/>Accordingly the appeal is dismissed without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
