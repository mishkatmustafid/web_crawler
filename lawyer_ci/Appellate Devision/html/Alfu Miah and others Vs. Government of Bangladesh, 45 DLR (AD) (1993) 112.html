The suit was decreed <em>ex parte </em>on January 9, 1970. On an application by the Government the <em>ex parte </em>decree was set aside and the suit was restored to its file and number on June 23, 1970. After about three years the Government filed written statement and, <em>inter alia, </em>took the plea that the suit was not maintainable in view of section 14A of the (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act, 1948<em>. </em>On February 9, 1984, fixed earlier for hearing, on the Government pleader's application the hearing was adjourned to February 29, 1984. On that date none appeared for the Government and suit was decreed <em>ex parte. </em>An application under Order IX, rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure was filed belatedly with an application for condonation of delay. After considering that the date for the hearing was fixed within the knowledge of the parties and the evidence of P.W. 1 that the date of hearing was within the knowledge of the defendants, the trial Court rejected the application for restoration. The prayer for condonation was also rejected as explanation for the delay was not found to be satisfactory. The appellate Court upheld that order. It held that die defendant did not explain each day's delay and the failure of the law clerk to inform the Government pleader about the next date of hearing was not sufficient ground for non‑appearance.<br/> <br/>2. Before the High Court Division the respondents cited <strong><em>Bangladesh Vs. Abdul Wadud 25 DLR (SC) 90, Bangladesh Vs. Israil Ali and others 1981 BLD (AD) 371, Bangladesh Vs. Jaheruddin 1986 BLD (AD) 180(182), Mst. Nurjahan Begum Vs. Giri Gopal Sarker 1979 BSCR (Vol. 3) 400 and Mst. Sanatannessa Bewa Vs. Baipatullah Sarker &amp; ors. 1989 BLD (AD) 1.</em> </strong><br/> <br/>3. A photocopy of the Gazette Notification dated November 17, 1955 produced before the High Court Division shows that CS Plot Nos. 32 and 37 had already been acquired, (not requisitioned as stated by the High Court Division), by the Government. After finding that the defendant had an arguable case under section 14A of the (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act, 1948 and the <em>ex parte </em>decree was not made in accordance with law, the High Court Division by the impugned order dated December 11, 1989 passed in Civil Revision No. 281 of 1985 set aside the <em>ex parte </em>decree.<br/> <br/>4. Appellant's contend that the cases cited before the High Court Division have got no relevance in the instant case. It is urged that the High Court Division also erred in entertaining for the first time a photocopy of the Gazette Notification dated November 17, 1955. It is submitted that the failure of the Government law clerk to inform the learned Counsel for the defendants cannot be a sufficient ground for non­appearance.<br/> <br/>5. Appellants contend that in view of the concurrent finding of the Courts below that there was no sufficient cause for non‑appearance, and the application for condonation of delay for filing the application for restoration was rejected on facts on the grounds of negligence the High Court Division erred in law in interfering in the matter when there is nothing on record to show that the Courts below appeared to have committed any error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/> <br/>6. In <strong><em>Bangladesh Vs. Abdul Wadud and ors 25 DLR (SC) 90</em></strong> where the court passed on <em>ex parte </em>decree allowing a claim based on construction works in spite of the plaintiffs' failure to produce the papers relating to schedule of work, the rate for work, the measurement books, the outstanding bills for the balance after the receipt of part payments, the Supreme Court held that the decree could not be sustained in law. It was observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"The absence of the defendant who asked for adjournment but refused to state reasons assigned therefore cannot give occasion for the plaintiff to obtain <em>ex parte </em>decree without producing the relevant documents on the basis of which relief is sought for. The Court is bound to apply its mind with reference to the pleadings and satisfy itself as to what should be the proper proof for passing a decree on the basis of the averments made in the plaint. It appears to us that the Courts below consider the non‑filing of written statement by the defendant after obtaining several adjournments absolved the Court from the responsibility to examine the legality of the claim of the plaintiff."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>7. These observations made with regard to a suit filed under the Code of <em>Civil </em>Procedure, it was held in <strong><em>Mst. Nurjahan Begum Vs. Giri Gopal Sarker 1979 BSCR (Vol. 3) 400 (402).</em></strong> would in substance apply in a case under the Small Causes Courts Act, 1887. It was further observed that "the trial Court must set out the point for determination and the reason for determination and this will again be arrived at on evidence on record, and the evidence on record must establish the case of the plaintiff which again must show a cause of action. It is true that t1wre is no hard and fast rule for writing an <em>ex parte </em>Judgment. If the substance of what has been set out herein are complied with the <em>ex parte </em>Judgment, however brief in expression, will stand. It will be difficult to sustain an <em>ex parte</em> Judgment which does not satisfy the condition of law as set out earlier."<br/> <br/>8. In <strong><em>Bangladesh Vs. Israil Ali &amp; others 1981 BLD (AD) 371</em></strong> a question was asked whether the plaintiffs' assertions that they successively took yearly lease till 1950 andpaid rent revenue up to 1956 could make out a case of tenancy right. After considering <strong><em>25 DLR (SC) 90</em></strong> and <strong><em>1979 BCR (Vol. 3) 400</em></strong> it was held that before passing an <em>ex parte </em>decree it was incumbent on the trial Court to whether such facts confer legal right on the plaintiffs against the Government. As the brief finding recorded by the trial Court did neither satisfy legal requirements nor from such finding the alleged case of the plaintiffs' was proved, the <em>ex parte  </em>decree was set aside.<br/> <br/>9. Respondents have the following observation made in<em> <strong>Mst, Sanatannessa Bewa Vs. Haipatullah Sarker &amp; ors. 1989 BLD (AD) 1</strong>, </em>"In considering an application for restoration the court often takes into consideration besides the grounds taken for restoration, whether any useful purpose will be served in allowing the same. In its anxiety to do justice the merit of case is often considered by the court before exercising discretion in such matter. We do not, therefore, think that the impugned order has been vitiated by reason of consideration of the merit of the case also. We ourselves feel having regard to the facts of the case that the plaintiff instead of being benefited in any manner will be driven to a fruitless litigation if the restoration as allowed.<br/> <br/>10. These observations were made in a where the appeal was dismissed for default and this court refused to interfere with the High Court Division's rejection of the application restoration.<br/> <br/>11. The Latin expression <em>'ex parte', </em>mea, from one party or side, has not been defined in Code of Civil Procedure. One of the basic principles of the adversary procedure followed in our court system is that as far as possible, no proceeding be ­conducted to the detriment of a person in his absence. One exception to this principle is that when the defendant, duly served with summons, dose not avail himself of the opportunity to appear, the Court may proceed in his absence under rule 6(1)(a) of Order IX. There being no mandate as such to make an <em>'ex parte', </em>decree, the Court may order for fresh service of summons on the defendants or adjourn the matter <em>suo motu. </em>If the Court is satisfied that the summons was duly served on the defendant it may proceed to decide the matter.<br/> <br/>12. The Court is to see that (i) the proper court fee is paid, (ii) the suit is not barred by either law of limitation or by any other law, and (iii) and the plaintiff is entitled to a decree on his averments in the plaint and his evidence, adduced in the case. Before an <em>ex parte </em>decree is passed, the court is required to go through the records whether such a decree could be passed on die assertions/evidence of the plaintiff, but the Court is not required to delve deep into die matter and ferret out a defence plea that may lead to lie dismissal of die plaintiffs case.<br/> <br/>13. The Court is not required to give an elaborate Judgment. How far a Judgment passed in an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding is to comply with the. Provisions of Order 20 rule 4(1) of the Code will depend on facts of each case. A Judgment in <em>ex parte </em>cases shall however state specifically and explicitly which of the reliefs arc granted and against which of the defendants‑see Rule 143 of the Civil Rules and Orders Vol. 1.<br/> <br/>14. In an application under Order IX rule 13 two questions are primarily to be answered (a) whether summons was duly served on the defendant, and (b) whether die defendant has sufficient cause for non-appearance in spite of the service of summons on him. It is not necessary to go into the merit of the case. I would not set aside an <em>ex</em> <em>parte </em>decree for its briefness when the defendant fails to bring home either of die two grounds on which such a decree can be set aside under Order IX, rule 13. In <strong><em>Reazul Hoque Molla Vs. Afizullah Hollah 42 DLR (AD) 74, </em></strong>this court held that the court cannot draw upon inherent power while acting under a specific provision of the law governing disposal of the case. Appellant in this regard further relied on <strong><em>Bajrang Rai and others Vs. Ismail Miah AIR 1978 Pat (FB) 339.</em></strong><br/> <br/>15. A Counsel is responsible for representing his client's case in court and ordinarily his clerk's failure to inform him about the date of hearing of the case will not be regarded as a sufficient ground for his non‑appearance. There may, however, be special circumstances indicating the learned Counsel's total dependence on his clerk because of his illness or such other good reason when a clerk's failure to inform the date of hearing to the Counsel may amount to be a sufficient cause for the Counsel's non‑appearance at the Lime of the hearing. No special case has been made out in this case.<br/> <br/>16. The laches of the respondents are worse than those noted in <strong><em>Bangladesh</em></strong><strong><em> Vs. Israil Ali and others 1981 BLD (AD) 371.</em></strong> However, when the High Court Division decided to set aside the <em>ex parte </em>decree after finding that the land in dispute had been acquired long ago and due notification was made in the Gazette, and that the defendant had an arguable plea of bar of suit under section 14A of the Emergency Requisition of Property Act, 1948, we would refrain from interfering with the impugned order in view of the particular facts of the case.<br/> <br/>The appeal is, therefore, dismissed. No costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
