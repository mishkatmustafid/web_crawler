Halder, Senior Advocate instructed by Ranesh Chandra Maitra, Advocate-on-Record- For the Appellant.<br/>A.W. Bhuiyan, Additional Attorney General, instructed by A. W. Mian, Advocate-on-Record- For the Respondent.<br/> <br/><strong>Civil Appeal No. 14 of 1987.</strong><br/>(From the Judgment and order dated 8.12.86 passed by the High Court Division, Dhaka Bench in Writ Petition No. 478 of 1986.)<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong><u>Badrul Haider Chowdhury J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>Leave was granted to consider the question; namely, whether the order of respondent No. 5 dated 9.1.86 cancelling the order dated 20.2.85 for de­requisitioning of .44 decimals of land by respondent No. 2 was passed illegally without giving any hearing to the appellant.<br/> <br/>2. Facts are as follows:- An area of 3.80-acrcs of land was requisitioned in 1965 <em>vide</em> L.A. case No. 64 of 1963-64 for the establishment of a Fire Brigade Head Quarter Station at Khulna Town. It is stated that the petitioner challenged the requisition unsuccessfully. Thereafter, he filed an application under section 4A (2) of the Emergency requisition of Property Act, 1948. After hearing the parties respondent No. 2, gave a, direction to drop .44 decimals of land by his order dated 26.1.1985, wherein it was noticed respondent No. 6 failed to furnish administrative approval as required by the authority and moreover the station head already been constructed.<br/> <br/>3. The petitioner then approached respondent No.3 for giving back their land. Suddenly the petitioner received a notice dated 9.1.1986 informing therein that the order dated 20.2.1985 was modified in respect of .44 acres of land and the same land would continue to remain under requisition.<br/> <br/>4. An appeal was filed before the Additional Commissioner, Khulna and the appellate authority took the view that since the order of de-requisition was cancelled by the Government nothing should be done.<br/> <br/>5. The petitioner filed a Writ Petition No. 478 of 1986 challenging-the impugned order. The High Court Division summarily rejected the petition on the ground that the Government had modified the earlier decision for de-requisition of 44 decimals of land and there was no illegality in such order modifying the earlier order.<br/> <br/>6. Mr.S. S. Halder appearing for the appellant canvassed that during the last 22 years no work was done upon the requisitioned land. Respondent No. 2 gave an order on 20.2.85 to drop .44 decimals of land from the requisition. According to him in pursuance of such order the derequisition proceedings had been initiated and the appellant had been served with such notice on 28.3.85. The learned Counsel contended that the impugned order modifying the order of de-requisition was illegal, inasmuch as the same was issued in violation of the principle of natural justice.<br/> <br/>7. The learned Counsel placed before the court the notice in "Form umo”. This notice is under Rule 10(1) of the Requisition of Property Rules 1948 for the purpose of ascertaining the person or persons to whom requisitioned property on release is to be restored. This notice was issued on 28.3.85. Sub-rule (2) contemplates an enquiry whereupon the officer shall give the applicant an opportunity of being heard and after making such enquiry serve on the person or persons who appear to be entitled to such restoration a notice in Form-F for the release of the property. Form-F under Rule 10(2) is a statutory form and the relevant portion may be quoted:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"And whereas it has been decided to release the said property/properties from such requisition;<br/>And whereas it has been held that you are entitled to get possession of the said properly/ properties;<br/>I hereby order that possession of the said property/properties be restored to you."<br/><br/>Possession of the said property/properties will accordingly be restored to you at ...............................................when “you are called upon to attend personally or by an agent on the spot to take delivery of possession of the property/ properties."<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">8. Mr.S. S. Halder argued that when the notice under Rule 10(1) was issued in Form 'E' (umo) in Bengali it was incumbent of the authority to undertake the enquiry under rule 10 (2).<br/> <br/>9. Mr. A. W. Bhuiyan, learned Additional Attorney-General, submitted that though the notice under Rule 10(1) was issued the Government itself had modified its earlier order on 1.9.86 and modified that in so far as .44 decimals of land which was earlier de-requisitioned was kept under requisition for a public purpose. The Planning Commission had placed Tk. 36,500,000/00 for construction and already the boundary walls of the requisitioned land had been constructed. The learned Additional Attorney General considered that the notice under Rule 10(1) had Ben issued, but no enquiry had been undertaken. This is not disputed by Mr. Haider and he frankly submitted that after the issuance of the notice no proceeding had been undertaken in pursuance of Rule 10(2). Rule 10(2) contemplates enquiry "after giving the applicant an opportunity of being heard." So when there was no enquiry the question of opportunity of being heard does not arise. The learned Additional Attorney-General submitted that before any decision was taken in pursuance of Rule 10 the Government had revised its order as contemplated by section 4A(2). Section 21 of the General Clauses Act is available on the principle of Locus poentiac (the power of receding till a decisive step is taken). Such a power is available under section 21 of the General Clauses Act. Reliance was placed on two decisions <em><strong>Shahbaz vs. Crown P.L.D. 1956 (F.C.) 46</strong></em><strong>;</strong> in that case the order of remission of sentence was to lake effect from 14.8.54 and the order was cancelled on the 13th. The Court held that this power of receding till a decisive step is taken is left with the Government. It was observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Locus poentitentiae in law refers to the power of receding till a decisive step is taken. If a decisive step is yet to be taken, we see no reason to restrict the power to modify or cancel."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>This view was reiterated in the case of <em><strong>Lt. Col. G.L. Bhattacharya V. The State and 2 others P.L.D. 1964 (SC) 503. </strong></em>In the case of<em><strong> Muhammad Himayatullah Farukhi P.L.D. 1969 (SC) 407</strong></em> the court gave a full view to this power of receding till a decisive step is taken and it was expressed that though decisive power is available to the Government under 21 of the General Clauses Act this power cannot be exercised once it has taken legal effect and certain rights created in favour of an individual. In that case respondent Farukhi was given an assurance in respect of the service matter but that assurance was not honoured by the Minister. It was, however, accepted by the President of Pakistan on 1.10.59 and the order was endorsed to the Secretary, Railways and Communications. In the meantime the President, however, on 1.10.59 recalled the earlier order. In the writ petition filed by Farukhi the High Court held the subsequent order of the President to be without lawful authority. The majority decision was that the order of President was illegal, inasmuch as, the power of receding till a decisive step is taken is subject to the exception that whether the order has been accepted in pursuance thereof certain rights have been created in favour of any individual, such order cannot be withdrawn or rescinded to the detriment of those rights. In that case Article 178 of the constitution contained a protective provision that the terms and condition of the service "shall not be varied to his dis­advantage”. In that case the effect of the order has practically purported to destroy the right that had accrued to the respondent Farukhi.<br/> <br/>10. The learned Additional Attorney-General contended that had it been the case that the notice under Form F had been issued calling upon the appellant to take delivery of possession as contemplated in Rule 10(2) then the argument should be advanced that such order could not be recalled. But here in this case no such step had been taken and the Additional Commissioner precisely referred to this circumstances by noticing that simple permission or order of the Ministry does not affect a proceeding "in any way unless acted upon", in view of the fact that the whole case recorded was not before the Joint Secretary who himself noticed that the record was incomplete.<br/> <br/>11. Mr.S .S. Halder could put his case at the highest that the notice in Form 'E' had been issued.<br/> <br/>12. The learned Counsel submitted that the power under section 21 was not available in view of the order of de-requisition that has been passed earlier. Reliance was placed in the decision of <em><strong>Md.</strong></em> <em><strong>Shoib vs. Govt. of Bangladesh 27 DLR 315.</strong></em> In that case it seems that the Government passed the order releasing the property in favour of the owner which was earlier taken over under Acting President's Order as abandoned property and the order says "unit is released in favour of the owner because they are now available to operate the unit." This order was passed on 19.2.1972 but possession could not be given due to hostile attitude of some factory workers. Whereupon the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka was directed to stay further proceedings in respect of the release of the firm, by Memo dated 7.11.73. This order was challenged by the petitioner.<br/> <br/>13. A Division Bench noticed the decisions of <em><strong>Md.</strong></em><em><strong> Hemayetullah in 21 DLR (SC) 236 = PLD 1969 (SC) 407 and Shahbaz vs. the State 8 DLR (FC) 20</strong></em> and concluded:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"On an examination of the above mentioned authorities it is clear that the <em>Locus poenitentiae </em>i.e. the power of receding before a decisive step has been taken can <em>be </em>exercised so long as there has not been any change in respect of the legal rights of the persons concerned. When some legal rights have arisen in favour of a certain person as a result of particular order, those rights cannot be undone by a purported exercise of locus poenitentiae, in respect of the said order. The power of passing an order rescinding or cancelling an earlier one which has given rise to certain rights shall have to be founded on some statutory provisions. In the context of the facts of this case, we are clearly of the opinion that as a result of cancellation of the notification under Acting President's Order, certain rights have accrued in favour of the owners of the Industrial concern in question and such rights can not be taken away by the exercise of <em>locus poenitentiae</em>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>There is no dispute to the aforesaid proposition but as has been noticed that save and except issuance of an order under Form 'E' nothing was done and no enquiry was held and then the Government recalled the order. No right accrued to the appellant. Facts in <strong><em>27 DLR 315</em></strong> are distinguishable. In that case the possession was to be given to the petitioner and a Magistrate was deputed to give possession to the petitioner but the same could not be done because of the hostile attitude of the factory workers. In that case the Government took the view the question of release and handing over possession to the former owner "is under examination in this Ministry and pending Government decision on the subject further proceedings may be stayed and status quo maintained."<br/> <br/>14. The Division Bench in view of the law that has been cited above declared that the aforesaid decision in exercise had been made without lawful authority and directed the Government to hand over possession. The facts of the present case are completely different. Save and except a view was taken that .44 decimals was de-requisitioned, nothing further was done and no enquiry was either held as contemplated by rule 10(2). Therefore, it cannot be said that any right had accrued to the appellant which should not be recalled.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong> Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, the opinion is the earlier order of the Government could be modified and recalled for which no exception could be taken.<br/> <br/>In the result, this appeal is dismissed without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
