Their nearest rival Abdur Rashid, Respondent No. 2, instituted Election Tribunal Case No. 2 of 1992 before the same Election Tribunal alleging various illegalities and irregularities, one of which was that about 100 votes cast in his favour were counted in favour of the petitioners. In both the two cases, evidence has been closed. By two separate orders in the two Election Tribunal cases the Election Tribunal ordered re-counting of votes to arrive at a decision as to whether votes cast in favour of one candidate were counted in favour of the other.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> The petitioner Ansaruddin Ahmed of CP No. 194 of 1993 and die petitioners Nasir Miah and Hakim Khan of CP No. 193 of 1993 then obtained separate Rules Nisi against the said orders of the Election Tribunal in Writ Petitions Nos. 174 and 113 of 1993 respectively By two separate judgments dated 20.5.93, the High Court Division discharged the Rules Nisi from which the petitioners preferred these two Leave Petitions.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> Mr. Md. Ozair Farooq, learned Advocate-­on‑Record for petitioners in the two petitions, canvassed that the Election Tribunal passed the respective orders of re‑counting without there being a factual basis in the evidence led by the election petitioners.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> We find that both the election-petitioners, AK Khalilur Rahman in one case and Abdur Rashid in another case, deposed that votes cast in favour of their respective symbols were counted in favour of the returned candidates.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> As there exists a factual foundation and the Election Tribunal found that a decision on these allegations cannot be given without recounting the ballots, the High Court Division rightly discharged the Rules Nisi.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> The petitions are dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></span></div></div></div>
