The High Court Division exercised its discretionary power without assigning any reason whatsoever. It simply said that it found prima-facie case in favour of the accused-respondent. This is not a legal ground for exercising the power. We have repeatedly held that it is an extra-ordinary remedy and an exception to the general rule of bail which can be granted only in extra-ordinary and exceptional circumstances upon a proper an intelligent exercise of discretion. This being the position of law settled by this Division, the High Court Division cannot exercise its discretion whimsically at its sweet will.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">We have given a cursory glance of the application for pre-arrest bail. The grounds are also not relevant for the purpose of exercising discretion in the case. More so, the case having been filed by the Durnity Daman Commission in exercise of its power under Act of 2004, the Durnity Daman Commission is a necessary party but, the accused-respondent has not made it a party. Considering the above, we find that the High Court Division has not properly exercised it discretion in granting the accused-respondent on anticipatory bail. The impugned judgment is set aside. This petition is disposed of with the above observations.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>
