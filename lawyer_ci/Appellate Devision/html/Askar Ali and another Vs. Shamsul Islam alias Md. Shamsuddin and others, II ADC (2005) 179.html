Material facts of the case, briefly, are that on 24.7.94 appellant No. 1, Askar Ali as sole plaintiff instituted Title suit No. 151 of 1994 in the fourth Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka against a large number of defendants, 111 in number, including the respondents as Defendant Nos. 61 to 67, for a declaration that the appel­lant is the owner of "2.90 acres of land of schedule property" including plot No. 759 bear­ing an area of .35 arces in Mouza Madhyer Char and plot No. 132 bearing an area of .69 arces of Mouza Napladi, and that the S.A. Records were wrongly published. Sometime after filing of the said suit the plaintiff amended the plaint by omitting plot No. 759 from the plaint. Subsequently on 16.10.94, the said Askar Ali, appellant No. 1 together with his son, appellant No. 2, Jointly brought a suit being Title suit No. 131 of 1994 in the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Keranigonj for permanent injunction against the present respondents as defendants so as to prevent the said defendants from creat­ing any obstacle in the possession of the plaintiffs in the aforesaid plot No. 759 comprising an area of 27 decimals and Plot No. 132 compris­ing an are of 36 decimals alleging title and pos­session therein. Whiled both the suits have been in progress, the respondents filed an application on 25.5.1995 under section 10 CPC before the learned Senior Assistant Judge, Keranigonj for stay of the suit i.e. title suit No. 131 of 1994 pending disposal of the previous suit i.e. Title suit No. 151 of 1994 of the Fourth Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka on the ground that the matter in issue in the two suits is directly and substantially the same. The learned Assistant judge by his order dated 30.5.95 rejected the application holding that the materi­al issue in the two suits is not directly and sub­stantially the same.<br/> <br/>3. Being aggrieved by the said order the respondents took a revision No. 2889 of 1995, and as already noticed, became successful. The learned Judge of the High Court Division allowed the application upon the view that "at least two suit plots in the above two suits are the same and in two courts proceeding are pending and to avoid conflict of judgments and to avoid possibility of multiplicity of proceedings, the subsequent suit should be stayed."<br/> <br/>Leave granted to consider whether the pur­port of section 10 CPC was correctly appreciat­ed by the learned Judge. That section provides:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“10. No court shall proceed with the trial of any suit in which the matter in issue is also directly and substantially in issue in a previously instituted suit between the same parties, or between parties under whom they or any of them claim litigation under the same title where such suit is pending in the same or any other court in Bangladesh hav­ing jurisdiction to grant the relief claimed, or in any court beyond the limits of Bangladesh established or continued by the Government and hav­ing like jurisdiction, or before the Supreme Court.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>4. For the stay of a subsequent suit under the section, the Court must be satisfied that in the previously instituted suit also (1) the matter in issue is directly and substantially the same, (2) the parties are the same or the suit is between parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same title, and (3) the court has jurisdiction to grant the relief claimed.<br/> <br/>5. Evidently in passing the impugned judg­ment the relevant considerations went by default and therefore it cannot be sustained as a good as proper judgment.<br/> <br/>It may be observed in the facts of the pres­ent case that although a suit for declaration of title has a great bearing on a suit for permanent injunction but the matter in issue in the two suits cannot be said to be directly and substan­tially the same. Admittedly neither the parties are the same nor the subject matter in the two suits although some of them are common. So this is not a particularly appropriate case in which the prayer for stay of the subsequent suit should succeed. However, having regard to the fact that at least one plot is common in the two suits in respect of which a suit for declaration of title is pending and permanent injunction is being claimed against the defendants (in Title Suit No. 131 of 1994) who are also defendants in the title suit, it is desirable that the two suits should be tried analogously by the same court. Mr. Shanti Ranjan Karmaker, learned Advocate-on-Record for the respondents, has readily agreed to the suggestion submitting that it is a much better course than staying the proceedings of the subsequent suit altogether.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, it is directed that Title Suit No. 131 of 1994 be transferred from the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Keranigonj to the Court of Subordinate Judge, Fourth Court, Dhaka and tried analogously with Title Suit No. 151 of 1994.<br/> <br/>The appeal is disposed of the above terms without any order at to cost.<br/> <br/>Let this order be communicated to the courts concerned at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>
