In the said writ petition the appellants prayed for a Rule Nisi upon the respondents to show cause as to why they shall not be directed to make over possession of the Moon Cinema Hall at 11, Wiseghat, Dhaka to the appellants pursuant to the Gazette Notification dated 24.8.77 (Annexure-D) issued by respondent No.1. The appellants case, <em>inter alia</em>, is that appellant no. 1 is a private limited company registered in the then East Pakistan with the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and appellant No. 2. is the Managing Director thereof holding majority shares, that the appellants used to carry on the business of exhibition of Cinema Halls and became owners of the Moon Cinema Hall, that the said Cinema Hall was wrongly declared as an abandoned property and handed over to respondent no.2 for management.<br/> <br/>3. Further case of the appellants is that appellant no.1 filed Writ Petition No.67 of 1976 for a declaration that the said Cinema Hall was not an abandoned property and the same may be released from the list of aban­doned properties. The present respondents were respondents in the said writ petition. Respondent no.1 contested the writ petition by filing an affidavit-in-opposition. The High Court Division by its judgment and order dated 15.6.77 made the Rule Nisi absolute declaring that the impugned notifi­cation of the respondents taking over the Cinema Hall in question as abandoned property has been made without any lawful authority and of no legal effect. The respon­dents were directed to make over vacant possession of this property to appellant No. 1 at once. Thereafter-respondent no. 1 in compliance with the said judgment and order issued a formal Notification on 24.8.77 deleting the Cinema Hall from the list covered by Notifications dated 31.12.72 and 15.12.72 and releasing the Cinema Hall in favour of appellant no.1. Respondent no.2 filed C.P.S.L.A. No. 291 of 1977 before this Division and while the matter was pending Martial Law Regulation No. VII of 1977 was promulgated on 7.10.77. on 20.1.78 the leave petition was dismissed as not pressed. Thereafter the appellants made several representations to the respon­dents for making over the possession of the Cinema Hall to the appellants but the respondents maintained that they were not legally bound to deliver possession of the Cinema Hall in view of Martial Law Regulation No.VII of 1977. Appellant no. 1 filed several petitions for drawing up con­tempt proceedings against the respondents and they took the same plea in their affi­davits that because of the promulgation of M.L.R. No. VII of 1977 on 7.10.77 the judgment in Writ Petition no. 67 of 1976 stood annulled and ceased to have any effect. As such the property in question remained vested in the Government. At the hearing of the contempt Rules on 4.4.94 appellant no.1 did not press the said Rules which were accordingly discharged on the same date.<br/> <br/>4. In rejecting the writ petition summar­ily the Division Bench by a lengthy order rejected all the contentions raised by the appellants.<br/> <br/>5. Leave was granted to consider the appellants' submissions that the High Court Division erred in law in construing para­graph 6(2) of M.L.R. No. VII of 1977 hold­ing it to be applicable only in cases of deliv­ery of actual physical possession ignoring the terms "other appropriate means" and thereby acted illegally in rejecting the peti­tion summarily as being not maintainable. Regard being had to the fact that the High Court Division declared in Writ Petition no. 67 of 1976 that the taking over of the Moon Cinema Hall as abandoned property was without any lawful authority and of no legal effect and in view of the direction to the respondents to deliver possession of the same to the appellants immediately and also regard being  had  to the  fact that the Government in fact complied with that direction vide Notification dated 24.8.77 deleting effectively the said property from the lost of abandoned property, the High Court Division gave a wrong interpretation of paragraph 6(2). M.L.R. No.VII of 1977 has or had no manner of application in the present case and as such the High Court Division erred in law in holding that in the present case the Cinema Hall in question not having physically been restored to the possession of the appellants sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 6 would be of no conse­quence. Lastly, leave was granted to consid­er the submission that the High Court Division misinterpreted the principles of law laid down by the Appellate Division in the cases of<strong><em> Nasiruddin Vs. Govt. of Bangladesh, 32 DLR (AD) 216</em></strong> and <strong><em>Ehteshamuddin Vs. Bangladesh, 33 DLR (AD) 154.</em></strong><br/> <br/>6. Since the main thrust of the argument of Mr. Rafique-ul-Huq, learned Counsel for the appellants, centers around the Abandoned Properties (Supplementary Provisions) Regulation, 1977 (Martial Law Regulation No. VII of 1977), published in the Bangladesh Gazette on 7.10.1977, it will be useful to quote the relevant para­graphs thereof as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>4. Vesting of abandoned property - </strong>Where before the commencement of this Regulation, any property, or the possession, control, management, administration or other rights of, or in respect of, any proper­ty, has been or is purported to have been, taken over under the Acting President's Order or as abandoned property under or in pursuance of the President's Order by, or under the authority or at the instance of, the Government, such property shall, notwith­standing any defect in the right or authority to take it over, vest, and be deemed always to have vested, in the Government.<br/><br/>5....................................<br/><br/><strong>6. Certain judgments, etc., annulled.-</strong> (1) Subject to the provisions of sub-paragraph (2) all judgments, deci­sions, decrees, writs, injunctions or orders rendered, passed, issued or made, before the commencement of this Regulation by any Court, which declares, or has the effect of declar­ing any such taking over or vesting of property as is referred to in para­graph 4 to be void, illegal, improp­er, irregular, incorrect or otherwise inoperative or ineffective, or which direct or require the restoreation, return, transfer or other disposition of any property as has been so taken over or vested, shall stand annulled and shall be of no effect as if such judgments, decisions, decrees, writs, injunctions or orders had not been rendered, passed, issued or made,<br/><br/>(2) Annulment of any judgment, decision, decree, writ, injunction or order under sub-paragraph (1) shall not disturb or otherwise affect the right or interest of any person in any property which, before the com­mencement of this Regulation, has been actually and effectively restored or transferred to such per­son by delivery of possession or other appropriate means in pur­suance of such judgment, decision, decree, writ, injunction or order; and such person shall exercise and have his rights and interests in the property as so restored and trans­ferred as if no such annulment had taken effect in respect of such prop­erty.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>7. The main plank of the submission of Mr. Rafique-ul-Huq is that by judgment and order dated 15.6.77 appellant no.1 obtained a declaration from the High Court Division in Writ Petition no. 67 of 1976 that the Cinema Hall in question was not an abandoned property and that the same may be released from the list of abandoned prop­erties. The respondents were directed to make over vacant possession of this proper­ty to appellant no.1 at once. Respondent no.1 in compliance with the said judgment and order issued a formal Notification on 24.8.77 deleting the Cinema Hall from the list of abandoned properties covered by Notifications dated 31.12.72 and 15.12.72 and releasing the Cinema Hall in favour of appellant no. 1. When the respondents' C.PS.L.A. No. 291 of 1977 was pending before this Division -Martial Law Regulation No. VII of 1977 was promulgat­ed on 7.10.77. Mr. Rafique-ul-Huq submits that although the physical possession of the Cinema Hall was not restored to the appellants yet by virtue of the fact that the High Court Division in Writ Petition no. 67 of 1976 declared that the taking over of the Cinema Hall as an abandoned property was without any lawful authority and of no legal effect directing the respondents to immedi­ately delivery of possession of the same to appellant no.1 and in further view of the fact that the Government in fact complied with that direction vide Notification dated 24.8.77 thereby effectively deleting the Cinema Hall from the list of the abandoned properties, the said martial Law Regulation No. VII of 1977 has or had no manner of application in the present case and the High Court Division erred in law in holding "but in the present case the Cinema Hall in ques­tion not having physically restored to the possession of the petitioners sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 6 would be of no conse­quence".<br/> <br/>8. Mr. Mahbubey Alam, learned Additional Attorney General appearing for respondent no. 1 and Mr. Akhtar Imam, learned Counsel appearing for respondent No.2, submit that Martial Law Regulation No. VII of 1977 is directly attracted to the facts and circumstances of the case. Sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 6 of the said Regulation has the effect of annulling all judgments which declares the taking over or vesting of property referred to in para­graph 4 to be void, illegal, improper etc. Or which directs or requires the restoration of any property so taken over. Sub-paragraph (2) gives protection to past and closed transactions by specifically providing that the annulment of any judgment shall not disturb or otherwise affect the right or inter­est of any person in any property which, before 7.10.77, has been actually and effec­tively restored or transferred to such person by delivery of possession or other appropri­ate means in pursuance of such judgment. Since in the present case, they both argue, the property in question has not been actually and effectively restored or transferred to the appellants, the latter are not entitled to the protection given under sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 6. The judgment in Writ Petition no. 67 of 1976 stands annulled.<br/> <br/>9. Having given our anxious considera­tion to the arguments of both sides, we are of the opinion that the contention of the respondents is correct. It is an admitted fact that the Cinema Hall in question has not been actually and effectively restored or transferred to the appellants by delivery of possession in pursuance of the judgment of the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 67 of 1976. The appellants, therefore, cannot take advantage of the protection given in sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 6. The High Court Division did not commit any illegality in interpreting paragraph 6 of the said Regulation.<br/> <br/>10. Mr. Rafique-ul-Huq next submits that the appellants are entitled to the protec­tion of sub-paragraph (2) because the Cinema Hall in question under sub-para­graph (2), though not actually restored or transferred to the appellants by delivery of possession, will be deemed to be in the pos­session of the appellants, not by way of delivery of possession but by way of "other appropriate means in pursuance of such judgment." By "other appropriate means" Mr. Rafique-ul-Huq means the Gazette Notification dated 24.8.77 deleting the Cinema Hall from the list of abandoned properties and releasing the same in favour of appellant no. 1. He submits that the High Court Division did not consider this part of his submission effectively and properly.<br/> <br/>11. Both Mr. Mahbubey Alam and Mr. Akhtar Imam jointly submit that the expres­sion "other appropriate means in pursuance of such judgment" should be interpreted <em>ejusdem generis </em>with the preceding words or phrases, namely, "by delivery of possession". For example, if the keys of the Cinema Hall are handed over to the appel­lants and the appellants authorize the respondents to carry on the business of the Cinema Hall till the appellants are ready to take it over completely, then it will be a delivery of possession by other appropriate means. The words "other appropriate means" must be akin to or similar to the kind of delivery of actual and effective pos­session to the appellants. Short of a similar manner of delivery of actual or effective possession mere notification in the Gazette releasing the Cinema Hall from the list of abandoned properties and releasing the same in favour of appellant No.1 will not entitle the appellants to obtain the benefit of sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 6. They submit that the High Court Division did not commit any illegality in not conferring the benefits of sub-paragraph (2) upon the appellants.<br/> <br/>12. Reading sub-paragraph (2) of para­graph 6 closely we find that the contention of the respondents must be upheld. It is clear from a reading of sub-paragraph (2) that it intended to confer a benefit upon those owners of abandoned properties who in pursuance of a judgment of a Court of law have actually and effectively received back the possession of the property either by delivery of possession or by other appro­priate means in pursuance of such judg­ment. The essence of the matter is that the owner must receive back possession of the property actually and effectively from those who took it over as abandoned properties. The actual and effective restoration or transfer may take place either by physical delivery of possession or by other appropri­ate means. The words "other appropriate means" in the context in which they have been used cannot but mean an effective restoration or transfer to the owners by means other than delivery of possession, i.e., a handing over of possession by any other appropriate means which is akin or similar to delivery of possession. It cannot be said that the publication of the Gazette Notification dated 24.8.77 is in the nature of actually and effectively restoring or transferring the possession of the property in question by delivery of possession or by means similar to delivery of possession. We, therefore, find that the High Court Division did not commit any illegality in not extending the protection of sub-para­graph (2) of paragraph 6 to the appellants.<br/> <br/>13. The last contention of Mr. Rafique-ul-Huq that the High Court Division misinterpreted the law as laid down by this Division in the cases of <strong><em>Nasiruddin Vs. Govt. of Bangladesh, 32 DLR (AD) 216</em></strong> and <strong><em>Ehteshamudin Vs. Bangladesh, 33 DLR (AD) 154 </em></strong>remains to be considered.<br/> <br/>14. The High Court Division merely summarised what has been stated by this Division in the first case cited and with regard to the second cited case the High Court Division considered the effect of lift­ing of Martial Law on 6.4.79 by Act No. I of 1979 known as the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution and quoted one paragraph from the second cited judgment. The High Court Division also held that the first cited case is of no help to the appellants.<br/> <br/>15. Having gone through the two cited cases we do not find any relevance of those tow decisions with the facts and circum­stances of the present case. Also, the <em>vires</em> of Act No. I of 1979 is not under challenge in this appeal.<br/> <br/>We, therefore, find that the High Court Division did not commit any illegali­ty in passing the impugned judgment and order.<br/> <br/>The appeal is dismissed without any order as to casts.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
