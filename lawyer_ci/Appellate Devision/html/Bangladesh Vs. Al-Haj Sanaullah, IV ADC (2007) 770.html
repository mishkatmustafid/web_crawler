Plot Nos. 1081 and 1082 of C.S. Khatian No.14 and an area of 1.06 acres of C.S. Plot Nos. 825, 819, 327 and 949 of C.S. Khatian No. 22, both of Mouza Faidabad and area of 0.54 acre of C.S. Plot Nos. 1287 and 1292 of C.S. Khatian No. 628 of Mouza Bownia under Police Station-Uttara, District-Dhaka which was requisitioned in Special L.A. Case No.8 of 1964-1965 along with other lands purport­edly under section 93A of the Town Improvement Act, 1953 for utilization in the scheme of Uttara Model Town for the benefit of respondent No.6. Subsequently another notice purportedly under section 93A (a) of the Act was issued for acquisi­tion of the said land of the petitioner for the aforesaid purpose but the notice was not served upon the petitioner. Very small amount of money on the basis of a prelim­inary award was paid to the petitioner ini­tially which he received on protest, on gazette notification was made by the Government and hence no final award was made and as such full compensation money was not paid to the writ petitioner.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> The respondent No.5 entered appear­ance by filing an affidavit-in-opposition denying the material allegations made in the writ petition. The case of the respon­dent is that the land in question along with other lands  were  requisitioned  under Special L.A. Case No.8 of 1964-1965 for the development of Uttara Model Town under section 93A of the Town Improvement Act,1953 and the land absolutely  vested in the Government under section 79 of the Town Improvement Act,1953.  Accordingly, compensation money was paid to the Respondent No. 3 for disbursement among the affected own­ers of the land. Inspite of the fact that no gazette notification was made vesting right, title in the said land on Rajuk, it may use or deal with the said property as may appear to it to be expedient.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> The High Court Division upon hearing the parties made the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> We have heard Mr. M.A. Azim, the learned Deputy Attorney General for the petitioner and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>  It is not disputed that an area of land measuring 1.87 1/2 acres belonging to the writ petitioner within Mouza Faidabad and Bownia, Police Station-Uttara, District-Dhaka was acquired for the pur­pose of development of Uttara Model Town. It is also not disputed that final gazette notification has not yet been made vesting right, title with Rajuk. Therefore, final compensation money was not assessed. The High Court Division rightly rejected the writ petitioner's prayer for release of the property in favour of the petitioner as the acquired land vested absolutely in the Government and even if some portion of the acquired property remains unutilized, the Government may use the same for similar other public pur­pose. Since the final compensation money has not yet been paid for want of gazette notification, the High Court Division rightly directed the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka to make final assessment of compensation money of the land in question of the petitioner within 2(two) months after such gazette notifica­tion. It was also rightly observed by the High Court Division that the Government may take immediate appropriate step for gazette notification in respect of land of the petitioner.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> In the facts and circumstances of the case and in view of the discussions made above, we are of the view that the High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision. There is no cogent reason to interfere with the impugned judgment.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> The leave petition is dismissed<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
