Shahidul Huq, Advocate-on-Record-For the Respondent.<br/> <br/><strong>Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 378 of 2007. </strong><br/>(From the Judgment and Order dated December 4, 2005 passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 1178 of 2005).<br/> <br/><strong>JUDGMENT</strong><br/> <br/><strong><u>Md. Ruhul Amin J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This petition for leave to appeal has been filed against the judgment dated December 4, 2005 of a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Writ Petition No.11 78 of 2005 making the Rule absolute and thereupon directing the writ-Respondent No.3, Deputy Commissioner, Sylhet to implement the order dated May 5, 2003 of the Ministry of Land in dated 5.5.2003 which is Annexure-D to the writ  petition, to de-requisition the house in  question in the light of the provision of  Section 8(1) of the Emergency  Requisition of Property Act, 1948. The High Court Division directed the aforesaid Respondent to take the appropriate action in the light of the Annexure-D to the writ petition within 2 months from the date of receipt of the judgment of the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>2. The writ petition was filed seeking direction on the writ-Respondent No.3 to implement the direction of the Ministry of Land relating to de-requisition of the house in question.<br/> <br/>3. Facts in short are that a tin-shed semi pucca house consisting of 3 (three) rooms on an area of 0.06 acre of land within the Sylhet Municipality belonged to Kiron  Behari Das, son of Krishna Bihari Das and  while he was in possession, the said property was requisitioned, that Kiron Behari Das's predecessor Krishna Behari Das dedicated the property in question in favour of family deity and that while Kiron Behari Das was residing in the house in question the said house with the adjuncts thereto was requisitioned under the provision of Emergency Requisition of Property Act, 1948 on February 13,1949 upon initiating Requisition Case No. RC-211B/1948-49for the purpose of residen­tial accommodation of the stuffs of the Sylhet Collectorate, that Kiron Behari Das delivered possession of the house to the Respondent No.3 on 13.2.1949, that stuffs of the Sylhet Collectorate stayed in the house up to 1990 and thereafter since the house became unsafe and unfit for habita­tion the stuffs of the Sylhet Collectorate were not staying in the house in question, that at one time the part of the house was leased out at a rent of Tk.200/- to Nazrul Academy, a non-government cultural organization and that one room of the house in question was leased out at a rent of Tk. 100/- to "Mustofa manob kollan kutub mahal” library on September 1, 2002. The writ-petitioner claiming to be the successor-in-interest of Kiron Behari Das filed an application to the Ministry of Land with .the prayer for de-requisition of the house in question. The Ministry of Land sent the said petition to the District Magistrate calling for a report as regard the subject matter of the application of the writ peti­tioner and another and thereupon the District Magistrate submitted report stat­ing the detail facts and recommended for releasing the house to the writ-petitioner and another being the successive heirs of Kiron Behari Das. On receipt of the report from the Deputy Commissioner, the Ministry of Land by the Memo, dated 5.5.2003 directed the Deputy Commissioner for derequisition of the house in question as per provision of sec­tion 8(1) of the Emergency Requisition of Property Act, 1948.<br/> <br/>4. As it appears, the Deputy Commissioner having had not taken any step for de-req­uisition of the house the writ-petitioner moved the High Court Division seeking for a direction on the Deputy Commissioner, Sylhet to implement the matter of de-requisition of the house in the light of the Memo, dated May 5, 2003 of the Ministry of Land and obtained Rule.<br/> <br/>5. The Respondent No.3 opposed the Rule by filing affidavit-in-opposition stating that the Ministry of Land has been approached to review or to reconsider the matter of de-requisition of the house.<br/> <br/>6. The High Court Division on considera­tion of the materials on record, particular­ly Exts. C and D to the writ petition held that "there is no ground for respondent No.3   in not implementing the order. Whether the petitioner is the real owner or not the matter to be decided by the respon­dent No.3 and he cannot decide that the impugned order is bad passed by his supe­rior officer" and thereupon made the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>7. It may be mentioned the Deputy Commissioner, Sylhet in his report dated April 29, 2003 ("Sharok no. LA/2003/198" dated 29.4.2003) mentioned that the staffs of Sylhet Collectorate are not residing in the house and that the petitioners are the  successive heirs of the original owner and as such the house may be de-requisitioned in their favour.<br/> <br/>8. We have heard the learned Deputy Attorney General and perused the materials on record. We are of the view the president leave petition reflects a situation as well as the manner in which the authority at the district level flouted the order of the Government in the particular Ministry, herein Ministry of Land. The situation, as reflects from the materials on record, shows a state of indiscipline in the admin­istration. The functionaries of the Government under the accepted norms are required to be respectful to the order of the superior and that subordinate functionar­ies are required to implement the order of the Government in the particular Ministry communicated to the government func­tionaries at the district level. We would like to mention that the Deputy Commissioner, Sylhet would as directed by the High Court Division implement the order of de-requisition in favour of the writ-petitioner herein Respondent without killing further time.<br/> <br/>9.  In the background of the discussion made hereinabove we find no substance in the petition.<br/> <br/>Accordingly the petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
