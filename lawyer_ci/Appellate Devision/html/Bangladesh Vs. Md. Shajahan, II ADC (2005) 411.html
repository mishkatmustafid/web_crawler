M. Mahmudur Rahman J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>Civil Appeal No. 132 of 1997 and 133 of 1997 by leave at the instance of Bangladesh is from the judgment and order of a writ Bench passed in Writ Petition No. 4165 of 1992 and Writ Petition No. 648 of 1987.<br/> <br/>2. Writ Petitioner Md. Shajahan filed Writ Petition No. 648 of 1987 and writ petitioner respondent Showkat Jong Hasmi filed Writ Petition No. 4165 of 1992 under Article 102 of the Constitution Challenging the enlistment of their respective house as abandoned property.<br/> <br/>3. Md. Shajahan in his writ petition started that one Hasib Khan was a lessee in perpetuity under the Government on the basis of a lease deed dated 18.11.1968 and Hasib Khan sold the property to him on 9.1.1983 pursuant to an agreement for sale dated 22.3.1970 but the Government by a Gazette Notification SRO No. 364-1/86 dated 23.9.86 listed the property under section 5(1) of the Abandoned Buildings (Supplementary Provision) Ordinance, 1985 in the "ka" list. Md. Shajahan filed Settlement case No. 103 of 1987 in the court of Settlement for exclusion of house No. 22 of Block-C, Tajmohal Road from the list of abandon prop­erty. The Court of Settlement dismissed the case by its judgment and order dated 25.5.1987 on the finding that Hasib Khan did not sell the property to Md. Shajahan.<br/> <br/>4. Md. Showkat Jong Hasmi filed Writ Petition No. 4165 of 1992 stating that on 21.3.1980 he got the sale deed of house No. 23 of Block-C of Tajmohal Road executed through court on the basis of the decree passed in Title Suit No. 228 of 1976 instituted for spe­cific performance of the contract against Hasib Khan. He also filed Settlement Case No. 233 of 1988 in the Court of Settlement for exclusion of his property from the list of abandon proper­ty. The court of Settlement by its judgment and order dated 4.11.92 dismissed the case on the finding that the property was rightly enlisted as abandoned property.<br/> <br/>5. Both the writ petitioners obtained a Rule Nisi in their respective writ petition. The learned Judges of the High Court Division made the Rule absolute by a common Judgment and order dated 9.7.1993 holding in so far as writ petition No. 648 of 1987 is con­cerned that the Government was not found in possession of the building in question and that inclusion of the same in 'ka' list was unautho­rized and that in so far as the property of Writ Petition No. 4165 of 1992 is concerned the same was not liable to be enlisted in the 'kha' list as the decision of the Court of Settlement in this case is leased on the finding of the other case filed by the writ petitioner of writ petition No. 648 of 1987 and that the Court of Settlement passed the impugned Judgment and order without lawful authority.<br/> <br/>6. Mr. B. Hossain, the learned Advocate-on-Record for the appellant submitted that whereabouts of the original lessee, Md. Hasib Khan, was not known after liberation of the country and he also failed to occupy, supervise and manage the property in person and as such it was an abandoned property as contemplated under clause (1) of Article 7 of the President Order No. 16 of 1972 and vested in the Government. The Court of Settlement, he con­tended, rightly dismissed the cases. He further submitted that the learned Judges of the High Court Division wrongly set aside the judgment and order of the court of settlement. He further submitted that the learned Judges of the High Court Division in exercise of their power under Article 102 of the Constitution fell in error of law in setting aside the order of the Court of Settlement in view of it's clear finding that the property legally vested in the Government as an abandoned property.<br/> <br/>7. Mr. Ozair Farooq the learned Advocate for respondent No. 3, Showkat Jong Hasmi, on the other hand, submitted that the property in question is not an abandoned property within the meaning of P.O. No. 16 of 1972 and did not vest in the Government inasmuch as the right, title and interest of his client in the property was decided by a competent Civil Court in 1980 and the Court of Settlement dismissed the case respondents without any finding regarding the claim. He also submitted that the court of settlement did not find that the bainapatra of the respondent was forged rather the civil Court found the same to be valid and genuine one. He pointed out that an enquiry was held and from the enquiry report dated 28.7.75 of the Ministry of Works, (Annexure-E to the Writ Petition) it appears that the property is not an abandoned one. He also submitted that both before the Court of Settlement and the High Court Division the Government failed to rebut the finding of the enquiry report that the properties are not abandoned and as such the judgment and order of the High Court Division does not call for any interference. He further submitted that neither the respondent nor his predecessor-in-interest was served with notice to surrender possession of the building nor the possession of the same was ever taken over by the Government and that the owner was in physical possession of the building on mutation of his name in the record of right and on payment of rent and taxes to the authority and as such the High Court Division rightly passed the judg­ment and order under appeal declaring that the building is not an abandoned one.<br/> <br/>8. From the judgment of die High Court Division it appears that the learned Judges came to a positive finding on evidence that posses­sion of the building in question was not taken over by the Government and as such it is inclu­sion in "ka" list was unauthorised and it is not liable to be enlisted even in the "kha" list although a notice for evection was given after a Gazette Notification was published. For enlist­ment of a property in "ka" list the Government must satisfy the court that the possession of the property was taken over by it and for enlistment in "kha" list the government must establish that it gave notice upon the person in possession of the property to surrender possession before it's enlistment in "kha" list. In these cases neither possession of the property was taken before publication of Gazette Notification wherein the property was enlisted under "ka' schedule nor any prior notice for surrender of possession was served upon the person in possession of the building. In view of these factual positions the Government had no authority to publish the Gazette Notification enlisting the property in question in "ka" schedule and accordingly the learned Judges of the High Court Division rightly declared that the property in question could not be declared as an abandoned property nor can it be enlisted in 'kha' list of the list of abandoned property as published in the impugned Gazette Notification.<br/> <br/>As in both the appeals the facts are somewhat similar and contentions raised at the Bar are identical by this common judgment we dismiss both the appeals without any order of costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
