The short fact leading to this petition is that respondent Mst. Shiuli Begum filed Case No. 16 of 1987 in the Court of Settlement stat­ing, inter alia, that holding No. 20/10, Tajmahal Road, Block-C, Mohammadpur, Dhaka was taken settlement from the Government by Ghalib Hossain for 99 years by a lease deed dated 15.2.1968 wherein the lessee constructed a structure and mutated his name in the Government Sherestha. On the basis of deed of agreement dated 21.6.1976 respondent agreed to purchase the said land and an amount of Tk. 8,500/- was paid as advance out of total consid­eration of Tk. 9,000/-. Upon Ghalib Hossains's failure to execute and register the sale deed respondent instituted Title Suit No. 317 of 1978 in the 1st Court of Munsif, Dhaka for specific performance of contract and the said suit was decreed ex parte on 18.7.1980. The respondent got the Kabala executed and registered through court on 3.11.1981. Further case of the respon­dent is that she has been forcibly evicted by the appellant from the case premises on 20.10.1986 on the plea that the property has been enlisted as Abandoned Property.<br/> <br/>3. The present appellant contested the case in the Court of Settlement and asserted that the original lessee left this country long back and his whereabouts were not known and the alleged transaction in between Ghalib Hossain and the respondent is a concocted one and that she was not in possession of the building at any point of time and was not evicted either. His further case is that Momtaj Begum was found in possession in the premises in question who instituted Title Suit No. 572 of 1982 in the 2nd Court of Subordinate Judge for specific per­formance of contract against the lessee Ghalib Hossain and others and this Momtaj Begum was subsequently evicted from the case premis­es by the appellant. Thereafter the Court of Settlement by judgment dated 15.3.1987 held that the original lessee was not at all present in the country at the time of passing of President's Order 16 of 1972 and his whereabouts were not known and that the respondent failed to produce the original agreement for sale for the satisfac­tion of the court that Ghalib Hossain's signature contained in the agreement tallies with his sig­nature maintained by the appellant in course of business. The Court of Settlement found that the respondent failed to establish the where­abouts of the original lessee Ghalib Hossain to get rid of the mischief of P.O. 16 of 1972 and the alleged possession of the respondent. She also failed to prove that she has been evicted from the case property and with this finding the case was dismissed. Thereafter the respondent moved the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 499 of 1987 challenging the judgment and order passed by the Court of Settlement.<br/> <br/>4. It appears that the High Court Division held that the Court of Settlement did not come to any definite finding as to whether the origi­nal owner left the country when President's Order 16 of 1972 came into force and as to whether the absence from Bangladesh is preju­dicial to the interest of the country. The High Court Division has held that the Court of Settlement is not competent to set aside a decree passed by the competent civil court. The High Court Division held that the Court of Settlement failed to decide the real issue i.e. whether the premises in question was an Abandoned Property or not and exceeded its jurisdiction in holding that the civil court decree obtained by the respondent was fraudulent and with this finding the High Court Division made the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>5. Leave was granted to consider the following:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"It is submitted by Mr. B. Hossain, learned Advocate-on-Record appearing for 'the petitioner that the onus being on the respondent to show that the property in question is not an abandoned property and the Court of Settlement having come to a definite finding that the respondent failed to discharge that onus, the High Court Division erred in law in holding that the Court of Settlement did not come to any decision as to the abandoned character of the property and further erred in law in shifting the onus of proof upon the peti­tioner, secondly he submits, the decree for specific performance of contract being a transaction between the vendor and the vendee and not being the kind of decree acceptable to the Court of Settlement for determining the abandoned character of the property, the High Court Division wrongly held that the Court of Settlement neither set aside the decree nor found it to be fraudulent, when in actual fact the Court of Settlement set aside the decree and found it to be fraudulent, Mr. B. Hossain submits that the High Court Division has failed to exercise its jurisdic­tion on a correct yardstick while interfer­ing with the decision of an inferior court."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>6. Learned Additional Attorney General led us through the judgment of the Court of Settlement and of the High Court Division and submits that the High Court Division committed wrong in holding that the Court of Settlement set aside the judgment and decree of a civil court and cancelled the same, it is also submitted that nowhere in the entire judgment the Court of Settlement passed such an order. He submits that the case of the respondent before the High Court Division as well as before the Court of Settlement is that she entered into an agreement with the original les­see Ghalib Hossain and when the lessee failed to execute and register the Kabala a suit for spe­cific performance of contract was filed which was decreed and she obtained a Kabala. Learned Additional Attorney General submits that this obtaining of Kabala is not sufficient to get a favourable order before the Court of Settlement or before the High Court Division because in that suit there was no declaration that the property is not an Abandoned Property or that the plaintiff's title was declared therein. The Court of Settlement decided the matter on the basis of status of the original lessee who failed to appear before the Court of Settlement and the respondent also failed to show anything on the whereabouts of the original lessee. Furthermore the definite case of the appellant is that respondent Shiuli Begum was never dis­possessed rather Momtaj Begum was evicted there from for which she also filed another suit for specific performance of contract. So the Court of Settlement clearly found that respon­dent Shiuli Begum failed to establish that she was in possession of the case property and she also failed to establish the whereabouts of the original lessee Ghalib Hossain. Respondent also failed to produce the original lease deed of Ghalib Hossain before the Court of Settlement. Learned Additional Attorney General submits that such matters have been set at rest by this Division in the case of C.Q.M.H. Md. Ayub Ali Vs. the 1st Court of Settlement and others reported in 47 DLR (AD) 71 wherein it has been held that the decree in the suit for specific performance of contract will show that it has only decided the controversy between the vendor and the vendee and directed the vendor to execute the necessary document in favour of the vendee. Such a decree is not one which is men­tioned in proviso (a) to section 5 of P.O. 142 of 1972. It has been held in paragraph 26 of the said decision that it will be seen that in proviso (a) no particular kind of suit has been men­tioned. The reference is to any decree or order which has been passed by any court at any time before the Publication of the list in the official Gazette. The list shall not include any building if the decree or order, is found declaring the building not to be an abandoned property or not to have vested in the Government under the President's Order 16 of 1972 or the possession by the Government of the building as an aban­doned property under that order to be illegal or invalid or directing the Government or any offi­cer or authority subordinate to it to return, restore of transfer the building to any person. The law has been well settled by this decision of this Division. In the present case before us the decree of specific performance of contract was obtained by the respondent and in this decree no such declaration as aforesaid has been made. The Government may be added as party in such a suit as required under P.O. 142 of 1972 but in such a case no relief has been prayed against the Government. The decree does not require the Government to do any­thing.<br/> <br/>7. In the present case before us the decree obtained by the respondent is a decree for specific performance of contract and such a decree cannot be a bar to declare a property as Abandoned Property. The respondent failed to prove the whereabouts of the original lessee and also her possession in the case property. From the perusal of the judgment of the Court of Settlement it also appears that the High Court Division was wrong in holding that the Court of Settlement declared the decree null and void. This finding of the High Court Division is wrong in view of the judgment of the Court of Settlement. It is the definite case of the appel­lant that Momtaj begum was in possession and she was evicted. This respondent Shiuhi Begum was not evicted. Onus lies heavily on the respondent Shiuli Begum to prove that she has been evicted which she failed to discharge. Having considered the judgment of the Court of Settlement and of the High Court Division and after hearing the learned Additional Attorney General for the appellant and the facts and cir­cumstances of the case and in view of the afore­said decision of this Division and the nature of the case as made out by the respondent before the Court of Settlement and also before the High Court Division we hold that the High Court Division committed wrong and illegality in making the Rule absolute. The High Court Division failed to consider the legal and factual position and came to an incorrect decision which require interfere.<br/> <br/>8. The appeal is accordingly allowed. Judgment and order passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 499 of 1987 is hereby set aside and the Rule earlier issued in this Writ Petition is hereby discharged.<br/> <br/>No order as to cost.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
