Short facts are that the writ petitioner filed the above mentioned writ petition for release of 6.42 acres of land from plot Nos. 178, 205, 206, 224, 247, 221, 220, 214, 199, 183, 204, 219, 213, 211, 212, 217, 218, 246, 226, 215 and 216 of Mouza Kanchpur, P.S. Sonargaon, District- Narayanganj stating, <em>inter alia,</em> that the aforesaid land along with other lands originally belonged to writ petitioner and those were acquired in LA Case No. 32 of 1968 and 55 of 1968-69 by the Government for public pur­pose namely, construction of Kanchpur bridge. The construction of bridge along with approach road was completed in 1968 but a vast area of acquired land remained unutilised by the requiring body. Since acquisition as it remained unused by the Government, the same should be de-requisitioned and returned to the original owners since policy decision was taken by the Government in 1984 and in the meantime in so many LA cases unused lands had already been de-requisitioned and returned to the original owners. The writ petitioner Jute Mills was previously nationalised and then disinvested in 1979 but due to shortage of space the present mana­gement failed to take up positive steps for expansion of the mill and for that matter several representa­tions were made for de-requisition of land of the aforesaid plots and when the property was not released the writ petitioner was constrained to file the writ petition.<br/> <br/>3. The appellant No. 6 contested the Rule by filing affidavit-in-opposition. It was the case of the appellant No. 6 that the property was duly acquired and compensation as per rule was paid and there is no provision for release of such acquired land even if remained unutilised. The Roads and Highways Department requires the land for expansion of bridge approach road to meet increased pressure of traffic.<br/> <br/>4. The High Court Division upon hearing made the Rule absolute and directed for release of the land as prayed for.<br/> <br/>5. Leave was granted to consider the submis­sion that the High Court Division acted beyond its jurisdiction in directing release of the aforesaid property when the same had already stood acquired, that the Additional Chief Engineer, Roads and High­ways Department, Dhaka Zone in the affidavit-in-opposition had asserted that they still require the land in question in connection with maintenance of the bridge and the approach road, that having regard to the principle laid down by this Division in the case of <strong><em>Abul Basher vs. Bangladesh </em></strong>reported in<strong><em> 50 DLR (AD) 11</em></strong> the impugned judgment of the High Court Division is liable to be set aside, that the High Court division was wrong in relying upon the Equa­lity Clause of Article 27 of the Constitution without having regard to the factual aspect of the case.<br/> <br/>6. We have heard Mr. MA Azim, the learned Deputy Attorney-General for the appellants and Mr. Rafiqul Huq, the learned Counsel for the respondent and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/> <br/>7. It is not disputed that in respect of LA Case No.32 of 1967 and LA Case No. 61 of 1957-58 gaz­ette notifications under section 5(7) of the Emer­gency Requisition of Property Act, 1948 (Act XIII of 1948) had already been published in the official gazette and in respect of LA Case No. 55 of 1968-69 no gazette notification under section 5(7) of the Emergency Requisition of Property Act, 1948(Act XIII of 1948) has yet been published. The learned Deputy Attorney-General submits the same is under process. He further submits that in LA Case No. 55 of 1968-69 the property was requisitioned for the purpose of permanent acquisition. The learned Deputy Attorney-General filed an application dated 9-7-2005 annexing some additional papers to show that there is a proposal for construction of Truck Ter­minal at Kanchpur on the unutilised land. The map of the proposed Truck Terminal has also been annexed. He further submits that in the case of <strong><em>Abul Bashar vs. Bangladesh and others</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>50 DLR (AD) 11</em></strong>, it was held that mere non-use of the acquired land for the purpose for which it was acquired will not give any right to the original owner to get return of the same and once a property is validly acquired after meeting the legal formalities it vests n the Government and its previous owner does not have any right to ask return of the same for its non-utilisation for the specific purpose for which it was acquired,. He further submits that the Government may use the utilised land for similar other public purpose. He further submits that in that case it was further held that Inter-Ministerial Communi­cations are merely policy guidelines in respect of certain matters concerning the business of the Government and these do not create any legal right in favour of any person to ask for return of unutilised land validly acquired under the law.<br/> <br/>8. In the instant case the High Court Division in making the Rule absolute taking into considera­tion that a high powered committee of the Govern­ment took resolutions of de-requisition of the land which were earlier acquired by the Government for public purpose, but remained unutilised.<br/> <br/>9. Mr. Huq of course frankly submitted that in view of the decision of this Division in the above cited case and subsequent other decisions on the point, the High Court Division was not justified in relying upon the decision of the committee for release of the unutilised acquired land. He submits that since in LA Case No. 55 of 1968-69 no gazette notification under section 5(7) of the Emergency Requisition of Property Act, 1948 (Act XIII of 1948) has yet been made, the land is still under requisition and the High Court Division accordingly rightly directed for release of the land at least in respect of LA Case No. 55 of 1968-69. In reply the learned Deputy Attorney-General submits in LA Case No. 55 of 1968-69 requisition was made for permanent acquisition and the publication of notifi­cation under section 5(7) of the Emergency Requi­sition of Property Act, 1948 (Act XIII of 1948) is under process. He further submits that in the case of <strong><em>Abul Bashar vs. Bangladesh</em></strong> <strong><em>and others</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>50 DLR (AD) 11</em></strong>, the land was under requisition and the same remained unutilised for 28 years. Mr. Huq further submits that the respondent paid rent for the land Khatian also was prepared in the name of the respondent Mill.<br/> <br/>10. Once the property is acquired and gazette notification is published under section 5(7) of the Emergency Requisition of Property Act, 1948 (Act XIII of 1948), the right, title and interest if any of the owners are extinguished and preparation of Khatian or payment of rent does not improve the position of the original owners in respect of acquired land.<br/> <br/>11. In the facts and circumstances of the case and in view of the discussion made above, we are of the view that the High Court Division committed error of law in making the Rule absolute and the same requires interference by us.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with Costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
