Pal, Senior Advocate, instructed by Sharifuddin Chaklader, Advocate—For the Respondents.<br/> <br/><strong>Civil Appeal No. 20 of 1983. </strong><br/>(From the judgment and order dated 13 July 1982 passed by the High Court Division, Comilla Bench in Civil Revision No. 1634 of 1981.)<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong><u>Shahabuddin Ahmed J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>In this appeal by special leave the question for determination is whether the respondents-tenants are entitl­ed to deposit rent with the Rent Controller, under section 19 of the Premises Rent Con­trol Ordinance, 1963, after they were duly served with a notice that their landlord alrea­dy transferred the premises to the appellants-plaintiffs to whom no offer of rent was made by them.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong> Defendants-respondents were admitted­ly monthly tenants of one Parul Bala Ghose and they paid rent to her upto Augrahayan 1381 B. S. By a registered sale-deed dated 25th Ashar 1382 B.S. corresponding to 10 July, 1975 Parul Bala Ghose transferred the entire premises to the plaintiffs-appellants. This transfer was notified by the plaintiffs, new landlords, to the defendants-tenants thro­ugh their lawyer one Mr. Jashimuddin. The tenants did not pay any rent to the plaintiffs, new landlords, but after about two years that is on 3 May, 1977 they impleaded the new landlords as an Opposite Party in Rent De­posit Case No. 112 of 1975 while they had filed against the previous landlady Parul Bala Ghose and in connection with that case they began depositing rent with the Rent Controller. The plaintiffs-landlords served a notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act upon the defendants termina­ting the tenancy and thereafter filed a suit, S.C.C. Suit No. 1 of 1979, in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Sylhet, for ejectment of the defendants on the ground of non-payment of rent from Poush 1381 B.S., roughly corres­ponding to January 1975, till the termination of the tenancy by the notice under section 106, and also on the ground that they requir­ed the premises bonafide for their own use, etc.  <br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> The defendants contested the suit by filing a written objection. They contended that the rent for the months of Poush and Magh 1381 B.S. were sent by Money Order to the previous landlady Parul Bala Ghose who received the same, and as to the rent for the month of Falgoon 1381 B.S., though it was sent by Money Order Parul Bala Ghose refused to receive it whereupon they filed the Rent Deposit Case on 14.4.75 and since then they have been depositing rent with the Rent Controller. Subsequently, when the notice of transfer of the premises was served through a lawyer by the plaintiffs claiming to be the purchasers of the premises, they made the plaintiffs parties to the Rent Deposit Case; As such they are not defaulters.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> The trial Court held that the deposit of rent for the months of Poush, Magh and Falgoon 1381 B.S. (roughly corresponding to months of January, February and March 1975) was not made in accordance with law and as such the defen­dants wife defaulters from before the transfer of the premises; and as to the rent since the transfer from 10 July 1975 the trial Court held that in spite of notice of the transfer the defendants did not offer rent to the plaintiffs and as such the question of plaintiffs' refusal to accept the rent did not arise. The trial Court further held that the tenancy was duly terminated by a notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act on the ground of non-payment of rent both before and after the transfer and on that ground decreed the suit by judgment dated 18 August 1981 and directed ejectment of the defendants. A learned Single Judge of the High Court Division, Comilla Beach held in Civil Revision No. 1634 of 1981 that under sections 8, 9 and 55(g) of the Transfer of Property Act. The plaintiffs-transferees of the premises were not entitled to any rent which accrued prior to the trans­fer on 10 July, 1975 and as such non-payment of that rent could not be a ground for ejectment; and as to the non-payment of rent after the transfer, the learned Single Judge held that this question should have been investi­gated by the trial Court and in that view of The matter set aside the decree for ejectment and remanded the case to the trial Court to determine the question whether the defendants were defaulters in payment of rent after the transfer of the suit premises. Leave was gran­ted to consider whether in the facts and circumstances of the case as appeared from the record the order of remand was warranted and justified.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> Mr. Abdul Hannan, learned Advocate for the appellants, does not dispute the finding of the learned Single Judge that the appellants were not entitled to claim the rent accruing prior to the transfer in the absence of any assignment of the rent by the transferor, landlady. But he contends that the order of remand is absolutely unnecessary since there is a clear finding by the trial Court that after the transfer of the premises to the plain­tiffs the tenants did not offer any rent to the plaintiffs though they were served with a notice of the transfer. It is not disputed that the appellants, after the transfer, served a notice upon the tenants-respondents through their lawyer one M. Jashimuddin. Defendant No. 1 in his deposition admitted the service of the notice though he could not give the date. But about two years after the transfer, the respondents impleaded the new landlords as opposite-party in the Rent Deposit Case of 1975 which they had filed against the previous landlady, Parul Bala I taking the ground that she had refused to accept rent. Now the position is very clear. It is that the tenants got notice of the premises to the appellants but they did not pay any rent to them. The trial Court came to a clear finding that ''there is no evidence on record that the defendants offered rent to the plaintiffs after coming to know that the plaintiffs purchased the suit shop or that the plaintiffs refused to accept rent of the defendants."<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> Mr. S.R. Pal, learned Advocate for the respondents, argues that they did not make any offer of rent to the plaintiffs as they had bonafide doubt as to whether the latter were really entitled to receive the rent and that in view of this 'bonafide doubt' they (tenants) impleaded the appellants-plaintiffs in the Rent Deposit Case which was pending at that time. M. Pal has relied upon sub-section (2) of section 19 of the Premises Rent Control Ordinance. This is quoted below:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“(2) Where any bonafide doubt or dispute has arisen as to the person who is entitled to receive any rent referred to in section 18 in respect of any premises, the tenant—<br/>(a) may deposit such rent, and<br/>(b) may continue to deposit every sub­sequent amount of rent which becomes due in respect of such premises until such doubt has  been removed or such dispute has been settled by the decision of any competent Court by settlement between the parties,<br/>within a fortnight of the date on which such rent becomes due or from the expiry of the time within which such rent is required to be paid under sub­section (5) of section 18."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From the facts as stated above we do not find anything which called for invoking the provision of sub-section (2) of section 19. The transfer was made under a registered sale-deed by the undisputed owner of the premises, and nobody questioned the appellants' purchase of the suit premises either. As such, there was no scope for the respondents to entertain any doubt about the transfer or as to whether the transferee’s landlords were entitled to receive the rent. In fact the tenants never came to the landlords to enquire whether they were ready to accept rent from them. Secondly, the Rent Deposit Case was filed against the previous landlord two years ago when she allegedly refused to accept rent. From her refusal, even if we assume that there bad been such a refusal, it cannot be said that the new landlords would also refuse to accept rent. Deposit of rent in favour of the previous landlord became totally irrelevant as soon as that landlord ceased to have any interest in the suit premises after the transfer; deposit in her favour cannot be taken as a ground to resist ejectment when sought by the new land­lord to whom no rent was paid in spite of notice of the transfer. If the tenants had any doubt about the service of the notice through lawyer the could have enquired from the land­lords themselves seeking clarification. Impleading the transferee-landlords in the Rent De­posit Case filed against the previous landlord is found to be a clever device to avoid payment of rent to the plaintiffs. The trial Court rightly held that the defendants were defaul­ters in respect of rent after the transfer. They may not be entitled to the rent prior to the transfer, but they are certainly entitled to receive rent since the transfer and this rent not having been paid the tenants were defaul­ters. As to the termination of the tenancy, by notice, it has remained unchallenged. In view of .this finding, the order for remand was absolutely unnecessary.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> In the result, the appeal is allowed. The impugned order of the High Court Divi­sion is set aside and that of the trial Court is restored. No order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
