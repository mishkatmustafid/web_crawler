Rahman J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This appeal is at the in­stance of the pre-emptees.<br/> <br/>2. Respondent No.1 filed an application under section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act for pre-emption of 12'34 acres of lands of some plots of C.S. Khatian No. 19 and also for 12'21 acres of land of subordinate Khatian Nos.2-25,27-28 and 36 of Mouza Hemchapur. His case is that '50 acre out of '90 acre of land of Plot No.333 belonged to Ananda Chandra Majumder who sold the same to Krishna Kumar Dey, Kamini Kumar Dey, Jamini Kumar Dey and Nalani Kumar Dey. Krishna Kumar died without any issue leaving three brothers and widow Saudamini who jointly sold the said land to Monoroma who in her turn sold the same to Satya Charan and the latter in his turn sold the same to Bhagaban Chandra Das. Bhagaban Chandra being in possession of '50 acre in Plot No.333 sold '25 acre of land on 13th February, 1956 to pre-emptor-respondent No. 1 and his brother whose names along with others were recorded correctly in the S.A. Khatian No. 23, for­merly C.S. Khatian No.19. Bhagaban Chandra sold his remaining interest, that is '25 acre, to respondent No.1 and his brother on 23rd August 1969 and thus the respondent became a co-sharer in the holding in question and as a co-sharer and an owner of contigu­ous lands he was entitled to pre-empt the land sold in auction on 12th December 1969 to the pre-emptees who were strangers to the case holding. Respondent No.1 also asserted that he had no knowledge of the auction sale till 12th February, 1967 when he heard about the sale from one Nurullah. After obtaining a certified copy of the sale certificate on 30th March, 1967 he filed the case for pre-emption on 5th April, 1967.<br/> <br/>3. The present appellants contested the case on the ground that it was not maintainable and it was barred by limitation.<br/> <br/>4. The learned Munsif dismissed the case. The court of appeal below upheld the decision. Respon­dent No.1 filed a Civil Revision Application in the High Court Division being Civil Revision No.36 of 1983 and the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division allowed the pre-emptor's prayer on 29th January, 1984.<br/> <br/>5. Leave was granted to consider whether the appellate Court erred in considering certain docu­ments, not marked as exhibits, for ascertaining the devolution of interest on the pre-emptor when the present petitioner had no opportunity to examine them. Leave was also granted to consider further whether the omission to mention plot in question i.e. C.S. Plot No.333 in the Sale certificate and in the writ of delivery of possession would support the pre-emptor's plea that he had no knowledge of the sale when C.S. Plot No.333 was a part of the total lands that were sold in auction and that sale was within the knowledge of the pre-emptor.<br/> <br/>6. At the time of the hearing of the appeal only one ground was advanced with regard to the consider­ation of the documents, by the appellate Court, not marked as exhibits.<br/> <br/>7. The pre-emptor filed a registered kabala dated 13th February, 1956 (exhibit-1) which shows that he purchased a portion of the disputed plot from one Bhagaban Chandra Das. It was not disputed that the petitioner and his brother's names were recorded in the S.A. Khatian. The trial court, however, held that in the absence of the document of title of the petitioner's vendor Bhagaban Clhandra Das, the petition­er's title could not be said to have been established.<br/> <br/>The decision of the trial Court was upheld by the appellate Court.<br/> <br/>8. On behalf of the respondent it is contended that at the appellate stage the pre-emptor filed two other registered documents showing devolution of the disputed plot by Monoroma Majumder to Satya Charan Datta and then by Satya Charan Datta to the petitioner's vendor Bhagaban Chandra Das and that respondent No.1 also filed an application for consid­ering those documents, but the appellate Court did not pass any order on that application and without considering the same dismissed the appeal. Respon­dent No.1, however, did not place before us any pa­per in support of this contention.<br/> <br/>9. From the judgment of the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division it appears, howev­er, that those documents were in the file of the case. After considering them and examining the facts and other questions relating to the matter he set aside the judgments and decrees of the courts below and al­lowed the Miscellaneous Case of the pre-emptor.<br/> <br/>10. In the facts and circumstances of the case even if those documents that were considered by the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division are ignored then there would be sufficient evidence on record, namely, the document of purchase by the pre-emptor from Bhagaban Chandra and the S.A. Khatian where pre-emptor's and his brother's names were recorded, and the fact the pre-emptor was in posses­sion of the suit land, for allowing the case for pre­emption. Hence we hold that the consideration of the documents as to the devolution of the vendor's inter­est on the pre-emptor did not materially affect the impugned decision. Accordingly, the appeal is dis­missed, but without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
