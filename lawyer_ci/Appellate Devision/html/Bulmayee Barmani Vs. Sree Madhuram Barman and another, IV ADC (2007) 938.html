Tafazzul Islam J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>Delay of 7 days is condoned.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the Judgment and order dated 21.08.2002 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision Case No. 1815 of 1997 discharging the Rule obtained against the judgment and decree dated 10.10.1996 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge) Second Court, Kurigram in Other Class Appeal No. 321 of 1995 allowing the appeal upon setting aside those of dated 19.04.95 passed by the learned Assistant Judge, Razar Hat, Kurigram in Other Class Suit No. 37 of 1994 decreeing the suit in preliminary form.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> The petitioners filed the above suit praying for partition after declaration of their title in the suit land contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit land appertaining to C.S Khatian No. 117 measuring 2.01 acres originally belonged to Sharbananda Das and Matinath Das in equal shares and their names were recorded in the C.S. Khatian and out of the above 2.01 acres of land one decimal of land was acquired for the road; Sharbananda, who got 1.00 acre of land in his share, he died leaving behind one daughter the defendant No.1 and one son the plaintiff No.2, the plaintiff No.1 was possessing the suit land as her life estate; that plaintiffs have homested in the westernside of Plot No. 227 and they, without partition, were facing inconvenience to possess the suit land and hence the suit for patition. The defendant No.1 contested the suit by fil­ing written statement contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit land appertaining to C.S, Khatian No. 116 is under Khatian No. 117; Sarbananda Das and Matinath Das were the korfa tenants of the suit land and they having defaulted in paying the Rent Suit No. 3485 of 1940 was filed which being decreed Rent Execution Case No. 807 of 1941 was filed in which Purnamayee, the mother of defendant No. 1 auction purchased the same on 10.9.1941 and got possession; Purnamayee being in possession of the suit land since her auction purchase S.A. Khatian was prepared in her name and she duly paid rents and after her death her son, the defendant No.1 is in posses­sion of the same and the plaintiffs were no longer in possession of the suit land after the auction sale.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> The trial court decreed the suit in pre­liminary from holding that suit land appertains to C.S. Khatian No. 117 and both parties admitted that Sarbananda and Motinath Das were the tenants in the said C.S. Khatian No. 117; Sarbananda was  predecessor of the plaintiffs and Motinath was the prede­cessor of the defendant No.1; the lands of C.S. Khatian No. 117 were not auc­tion Lold and the defendants could not prove that Purnamayee, the mother of the defendant No.1, got the land of C.S. Khatian No. 117 on the basis of auction purchase and as such preparation of S.A. Khatian in the name of Purnamayee has no basis at all; the documents filed by the defendants show that it is only the lands of C.S. Khatian No.116 which were auction sold and as such plaintiffs title and possession in respect of eight annas share in respect C.S. Khatian No.117 as described in the schedule ‘Ka’ of the plaint being proved the plaintiffs are entitled to get a preliminary decree.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> The defendant No.1 then preferred Other Class Appeal No. 31 of 1995 and the learned  Subordinate  Judge (now Joint District Judge), 2nd Court, Kurigram, after hearing, allowed the appeal holding that the certified copy of 940 Bulmayee Barmani alias Srimati Bulmayee Barmanivs. Sr the C.S. Khatain No.116 shows that C.S Khatian No.117 is an undertenure Khatian of C.S. Khatian No.116 and so after the lands of C.S Khatian No.116 were auction sold the title and posses­sion of the Korfa tenants under C.S. Khatian No. 117, which is the under tenure Khatian of C.S Khatian No. 116, automatically extinguished; the trial Court ought to have found that Poyatu Barman was the tenant of C.S. Khatian No. 116 and Sarbananda and Motinath were the korfa tenants of C.S. Khatian No. 117 which is the undertenure Khatian of C.S Khatian No. 116; according to the provisions of section 48(C) of the Bengal Tenancy Act 1885 if the land of tenant is auction sold, the possession of korfa tenant is extin­guished and so after such auction sale there is no necessity to file any case against korfa tenants after issuing any notice upon them, the plaintiff No. 1 claimed portion of the suit lands on the basis of her life estate and if her claim is accepted then how her son, plaintiff No. 2, during her life time can get the land as per provisions of the Hindu Law. The plaintiffs then moved the High Court Division and obtained Rule in civil Revision 1815 of 1999 and the High Court Division after hearing dis­charged the Rule holding that admitted­ly the suit land appertains to C.S. Khatian No. 117 and the total land in the Khatian is 2.01 acres and Sarbananda and Motinath were the korfa tenant under Puyatu Barman and Harakanta Barman in equal sharers, the C.S., Khatian No. 117 has been marked exhib­it Ka(1); Exhibit Ka is the C.S. Khatian No. 116 in which it is found that C.S. Khatian No. 117 was the under khatian of khatian No. 116 as such 2.01 acres of land was also mentioned in that khatian;the papers and evidences filed show that 2.01 acres of land was auctioned sold in Rent Execution Case No. 807 of 1941 and Purnamoyee auctioned purchased the same through Court and Ext. Gha is the sale certificate showing the area of auctioned land as 2.01 acres; Ext. Ga is the S.A. Khatian where the name of Purnamoyee has been recorded in respect of the land auction purchased by her and there are good number of rent receipts which has been marked exhibit Kha series showing payment of rent by Purnamoyee which prove the continu­ous possession of the defendant No.1; the plaintiffs examined 4 witnesses among them P.W.1 is the plaintiff No. 2 the son of plaintiff No. 1 and P.Ws. 2 and 3 are the neighbours and P.W. 4 is the plaintiff No. 1, the mother of plaintiff Nos. 2; P.W. 4, in her cross-examination stated that she does not know whether the suit land has been auctioned sold or not and she is also not aware of the S.A. record of the suit land; she never paid rent of the suit land and can not say the khatian and plot number of the suit land and her son has instituted the suit; the above statement of P.W. 4 on oath goes against the case of plaintiff as she her­self did not file the suit and it is only her son, plaintiff No. 2, instituted the present suit during the life time of his mother and so plaintiff No. 2, has no <em>locus standi</em> to file the suit. The High Court Division in its judgment referred to the case of <strong><em>Rai Krishna Shaha vs. Md. Matleb Ali Pramanik</em></strong> <strong><em>and others</em></strong> report­ed in <strong><em>34 DLR (HCD) 179</em></strong> where it has been held:-<br/> <br/>"Considering the aforesaid provi­sions of sub-sections (1) and 3 of Section 3 of the Hindu Womens Rights to the Property Act (XVIII of 1937) it clearly appears that during the period of her life time a Hindu widow is a complete owner and co-sharer of any property or holding in question with the right to claim par­tition and consequently having the right to claim pre-emption under, section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act. In this connection it may be mentioned that it has been represented that <strong>Mostafa Kamal, J. </strong>sitting single in another Bench has held the same view in Civil Revision Case No. 98 of 1978 by his judgment dated 4th February, 1982”.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> The High Court Division, considering decision in the above reported case held that the plaintiff No.2 has no <em>locus standi</em> to file the suit but his mother deposed that her son instituted the suit and so the above statement supports the auction sale and the continued possession of the defendant No.1 in the suit land and accordingly the  learned  Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), did not commit any error in observing that dur­ing the life time of plaintiff No. l has son the plaintiff No.2 is not entitled to any relief.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> We have heard the learned counsel of the petitioner and perused the evidence and materials on record. The learned counsel could not show any misreading or non-consideration of the evidence and the materials on record. Accordingly there is no cogent reason to interfere with the decision of the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
