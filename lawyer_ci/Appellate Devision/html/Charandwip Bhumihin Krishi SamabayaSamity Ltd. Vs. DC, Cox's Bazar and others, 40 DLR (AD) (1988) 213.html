Appellant which is a registered Samity under the Co-operative societies Act was granted lease of five Fisheries in Charandwip mouza within Chokoria Upazila in the District of Cox's Bazar for a term of three years from 1391 B.S. to 1393 B.S. by the Upa­zila Fisheries Officers. An agreement was signed by the parties on 30th April 1984. Respondent No. 1, namely, Deputy Commissioner of Cox's Bazar leased out the said five Fisheries to respondent No.5, Samity for one year on 18th July 1985 with­out any notice to the appellant's Samity. Appellant moved an application to respondent No.3, Secretary, Ministry of Land Administration and Land Reforms who directed respondent No.1 to submit a report on the violation of the order granted earlier by respon­dent No.2, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Land Admin­istration and Land Reforms stayed further proceed­ings with respect to the five Fisheries. Appellant having failed to obtain any remedy from the Mini­stry of Land Administration and Land Reforms filed Writ Petition, No. 307 of 1985 before the High Court Division, Dhaka. On 5th September, 1985 the learned Judges of the High Court Division issued the following Rule Nisi upon the respondents:<br/> <br/>"Let a Rule Nisi issue calling upon the re­spondents 1-5 to show cause as to why the impunged order of the fisheries in question with the respondent No.5 by the respondent No.1 on 19.7.1985 or at any date vide the Annexure-‘D’ should not be declared to have been granted or given without any lawful authority and of no le­gal effect and why the petitioner-Samity's still subsisting lease-hold right and interest in the impugned fisheries should not be declared as le­gal and lawful, or such other or further order or orders passed as to this Court may seem fit and proper."<br/> <br/>3. At the same time the learned Judges stayed the operation of the impugned leasing of the fisheries in question with respondent No.5 by respondent No.1 on 18th July 1985 or any date for three months from date, that is, 5th September 1985.<br/> <br/>4. On 11th September 1985 an application was filed by respondent No.5 before the High Court Di­vision for vacating the said order of stay. In the ap­plication it was stated that the Nazir of the Upazila Nirbahi Officer delivered possession of the said five fisheries to respondent No. 5 which had been in pos­session and enjoyment of the Fisheries on payment of stipulated rent and that the appellant was not in possession of the same. Further, it was prayed that the order of stay passed by the High Court Division on 5th September 1985 may, therefore, be vacated.<br/> <br/>5. Referring to the statement made by the ap­pellant in paragraph 6 of the aforesaid Writ-Petition wherein it was stated that respondent No.1 knowing­ly and deliberately leased out the said five Fisheries with respondent No. 5 on 18th July 1985 in flagrant violation of the order of respondent No.2 passed on 10th July 1985 claiming subsisting legal and lawful lease-hold right, interest and possession in the five Fisheries. The learned Judges of the High Court Di­vision found it contradictory. Accordingly, the fol­lowing order was passed by the High Court Division vacating the order of stay granted by it on 5th Sep­tember 1985:<br/> <br/>"In view of the contradictory statements made by the petitioner and the respondent No.5 we are of the opinion that there is a disputed question of fact as to possession of the parties which we cannot decide at this stage. In this view of the matter the order of stay granted by this Court on 5.9.85 is vacated.<br/>In this view of the matter this application is allowed."<br/> <br/>6. Being aggrieved the appellant moved this Court and obtained special leave to appeal in the fol­lowing terms:<br/> <br/>"Mr. Ishtiaq Ahmed, learned Counsel ap­pearing for the petitioner argued that when the High Court Division was satisfied as to the prima facie case of the petitioner which led to the issuance of the rule the subsequent order vacat­ing the stay renders the decision inconsistent, in­asmuch as the rule had not been heard as yet. In vacating the order of stay the High Court Divi­sion practically nullified the issuance of the or­der of the rule itself and that begs the question whether the satisfaction in granting the rule and vacating the ad-interim stay could be justified on the well settled principle of judicial discre­tion.<br/>Points merit consideration. Leave is grant­ed."<br/> <br/>7. Along with this order granting leave this Court ordered the stay of the operation of the order 'dated 12th September 1985 by the High Court Division, Dhaka in writ-Petition No. 307 of 1985 till the disposal of the appeal.<br/> <br/>8. Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed, appellant's counsel, submitted that the order of the High Court Division vacating the order was passed after the learned Judg­es were prima facie satisfied about the appellant's right and possession in the said fisheries. Further, in their application filed on 11th September 1985 re­spondent No.5 merely stated facts which were not substantiated by any materials on record so as to en­able the High Court Division to pass the impugned order in the absence of any materials on record justifying the impugned order. It would seem to be arbi­trary and also contrary to established practice of the Court.<br/> <br/>9. It appears that the application filed by re­spondent No. 5 on 11th September 1985 was heard in the presence of both parties. Having gone through the petition part of which has been quoted in the judgment and also the relevant paragraph in the aforesaid Writ-Petition which showed conflicting claims, the learned Judges of the High Court Divi­sion were satisfied that the order granted by them earlier should be vacated. Accordingly, in exercising their discretion they passed the impugned order. It cannot be conceived that once a stay order is passed by the High Court Division it loses its discretion to vacate the same, even if it is satisfied that the same should be vacated. Further, in view of the reasons given for vacating the order, we do not feel that there has been any arbitrary exercise of discretion.<br/> <br/>10. It appears that an application for drawing up contempt proceeding for violation of the stay order dated 4th November 1985 granted by this Court in Civil petition for Special Leave to appeal No. 52 of 1985 was filed which came up for hearing with this appeal. In this petition it has been alleged that the appellant had been interfered with in their possession of the fisheries in question. Some of the members of the appellant’s Samity had, by erecting thatched huts on the land around the fisheries, been living therein with their families. On 7th November 1985 respondents Nos 1-11, being accompanied by respondent No. 12 and 7/8 police men went to the fisheries in question and forcibly evicted the members of the appellants from the fisheries in question. It was also stated the petition that though the respondents shown the certified copy of the short Order of this Hon’ble Court dated 4th November 1985, they did not pay any heed to it. By referring to Martial Law Order No. 111 of 1985 they expressed the view fee aforesaid Order of this Hon'ble Court was of no avail and use.<br/> <br/>11. Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed, Counsel for the appel-quite vehemently deprecated the defiance shown by the respondents as just mentioned and submitted that their conduct amounted to obstruction of the course of justice and they were, therefore, guilty of gross contempt of Court. Since the appeal from this petition has arisen has been dismissed, petition, suffice it to say, has no legs to stand but as the allegations made in the petition raise the question whether the respondents in the petition guilty of contempt of Court by disregarding Court's Order dated 4lh November 1985 it will be well to consider if there is any merit in it.<br/> <br/>12. On a scrutiny of our Order as aforesaid, it appears that by referring to an order of the High Court Division dated 12th September 1985 this Court stayed the operation of the same till the disposal of the appeal. By the aforesaid order the High Court Division vacated its earlier order dated 5th September 1985staying the operation of the impugned leasing out of the fisheries in fisheries in question by the respondent No.1 to respondent No. 5 on 18th July 1985.<br/> <br/>13. What was, therefore, shown to the respondents was the short Order passed by this Court on 4th November 1985, as alleged by the appellant in his petition for drawing up contempt proceeding for violation of the said order. Regrettably enough, the appellant failed to show the respondents any clear order of this Court requiring them to do or not to do certain acts. At the lime of admission of this appeal the appellant was satisfied by obtaining a short Or­der of stay with respect to the High Court's order. What is the sum total of the effect of this Court's Or­der on the orders passed by the High Court Division or on the respondents does not appear to be clear. If the appellant apprehended what the respondents might do as they are now alleged to have done on 7lh November 1985, a definite clear order restrain­ing the respondents from interfering with the appel­lants' possession should have been obtained. The ab­sence of such order .quite arguably leaves ample scope for wrong understanding. Of course, the frus­tration of the appellant at the respondents' behaviour is understandable but unavoidably what this Court is now to order and expected to decide must have the foundation in law and reason. Having regard to the circumstances discussed above, it would not be rea­sonable to entertain the application, though it is felt that the respondents' behaviour has been presumptu­ous.<br/> <br/>For the reasons stated above, the appeal is dis­missed. There will, however, be no order as to costs. The contempt petition is also dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
