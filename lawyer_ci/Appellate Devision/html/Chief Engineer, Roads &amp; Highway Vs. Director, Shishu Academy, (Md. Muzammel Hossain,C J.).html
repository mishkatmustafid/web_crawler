Presumption of correctness under section 103(B) (5) of the Bengal Tenancy Act has to be rebutted by the persons who allege it. When the Supreme Court of Bangladesh has been in continuous ownership and possession of its land and structures thereon, mere recording of the land erroneously in the names of other organization or departments would not by itself entitle them to claim ownership or control over the land in question and therefore the lease purported to have been granted by these Departments in favour other organization or bodies would not transfer any title in favour of them. . . .

In the facts and circumstances of the case, we have invoked the extra-ordinary power of this Division under Article 104 of the Constitution for doing complete justice in the instant case. This Article does not confer new jurisdiction but it gives power to the Court where it has jurisdiction in matter before it. When this court finds that no remedy is available to the present respondent though gross injustice has been committed to it, this Division would definitely invoke the jurisdiction under Article 104 to do compete justice in the matter. It is an incorrect proposition to state that since the land of the High Court of East Bengal and, subsequently after the emergence of Bangladesh, the land of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh has not been recorded in its name during the S.A. the R.S. or the D.M.S operations, the Supreme Court loses its right, title, interest and possession of the land in question. In view of the foregoing findings and observations, we are invoking the power under Article 104 of the Constitution to do complete justice in holding that the land recorded in the name of Bharat Samrat under C.S.

On the land so specified and demarcated for the Governor House, the High Court of East Bengal headed by the Chief Justice A.S.M. Akram was subsequently established in 1947. During that period, the High Court had two kinds of <span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt;">jurisdiction, one being the Appellate Jurisdiction</span> and the other being the Original Jurisdiction. The land in question which originally belonged to the Governor House, was transferred to the then High Court of East Bengal which was subsequently named as the High Court of East Pakistan after the enactment of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1956. The C.S. record was prepared in the name of Bharat Samrat and the C.S. Map reveals that the property was bounded by a demarcated wall. The land which originally belonged to the then High Court of East Pakistan, after liberation of Bangladesh, automatically vested in the Supreme Court of Bangladesh by operation of law. After the change-over of 1975 when the country was governed by Extra-Constitutional Regime, some other organizations occupied certain portions of the Supreme Court land illegally which had purportedly been leased out to them. In the after math of this it has been felt that time has come to demarcate the concerned land belonging to the Supreme Court in its entirety so that the same can be identified and clearly recognized to meet the acute shortage of <span style="letter-spacing: -.5pt;">space required for the apex Court of the Country.</span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">6.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">Unfortunately, it has been revealed that the land belonging to the Supreme Court of Bangladesh has not been recorded in the name of Supreme Court.

As a part of the Supreme Court’s land under illegal occupation of some other organizations is beyond the Supreme Court’s de-facto control, it has become imperative to demarcate the said land.

In examining the Constitution</span> and establishment of the then erstwhile High Court of East Bengal at Dhaka, one cannot ignore the constitutional history of the partition of the then British India which was divided into two Dominions, namely, India and Pakistan. The State of Pakistan had originally five provinces, namely, Provinces of East Bengal, Punjab, Beluchistan, Sindh and the North West Frontier Province (NWFP). The territory, presently comprising the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, was initially the Province of East Bengal which was subsequently re-named as East Pakistan under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1956. After the partition of India, the High Court of Calcutta at the Fort William was divided into two parts, one of which was transferred to the Province of East Bengal with its entire establishment including all relevant records and some of the Judges of the Calcutta High Court who opted for Pakistan to serve in the High Court of East Bengal at Dhaka.

The filing of the appeals from the then India to the Privy-Council in England was introduced by the Charter of 1726. Subsequently, the East India Company Regulating Act, 1773 was introduced to place the East India Company under the control of the British Government and provisions were made for the establishment of the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William, Calcutta through Charter or Letters Patent. The Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William in Bengal was established by Letters Patent issued on March 26, 1774. Subsequently, judicial system of the then India was recognized by introducing the Indian High Courts Act,1861 by which High Courts were established<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>in Calcutta, Madras and Bombay abolishing the Supreme Courts at Fort William, Calcutta.

Immediately after the independence of Pakistan, Mr. Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the then Governor-General of Pakistan, in a public meeting at Ramna Race Course on 21<sup>st</sup> March, 1948 declared that the Urdu shall be the State Language of Pakistan. Thereafter, while addressing the Special Convocation of the University of Dhaka on 24<sup>th</sup> March,1948,he repeated the same and declared that “the Urdu shall be only the state language of Pakistan”. The students of the University of Dhaka vehemently raised objection and voiced their protests shouting “No, No”. This decision of the Government of Pakistan became clear, subsequently, in the activities of both the Federal Government of Pakistan and the Provincial Government of East Bengal. This led to the formation of All Party State Language Committee of Action and the 21<sup>st</sup> February, 1952 was declared the “State Language Day”. It does not require any elaborate discussion that students of the University of Dhaka held protest meetings and brought out huge demonstrations in the University Campus which brought them into direct conflict with the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>then Government. The Law Enforcing Agency, namely, the police deployed by the then Provincial Government opened fire to stop processions and demonstrations resulting in the killings of Salam, Rafiq, Barkat and Jabbar and injuring hundreds of students and consequently, thousands of students, people and politicians were arrested. This led the people of the Province to take initiatives seriously and they reiterated their demands to establish Bangla as one of the State Languages of the then Pakistan. In the General Elections of 1954, the United Front dominated by the then East<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Bengal won majority giving a crashing defeat to the ruling Muslim League. The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1956 clearly stated that the structure of the Government was Federal and East Pakistan was one of the Provinces of Pakistan. Furthermore, Article 214 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1956 recognized Bangla as one of the State Languages of Pakistan along with Urdu. However, the constitutional development of Pakistan is not a happy one; Martial Law was declared in October, 1958 abrogating the Constitution of 1956 dissolving both the National and the Provisional Assemblies of Pakistan and banning political parties. The then Military Ruler of Pakistan formed a Constitution Committee in 1960 headed by Mr. Justice Shahabuddin, a former Chief Justice of Pakistan. Ultimately, the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Constitution of 1962 was enacted which was in force till 25<sup>th</sup> March,1969 when it was abrogated by General Yahia Khan, the then Military Ruler of Pakistan, by way of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Proclamation of Martial Law which was made effective all over the then Pakistan. Thereafter, the history depicts numerous unpleasant events which compelled the people of this part of the Sub-continent, which is now Bangladesh, to revolt resulting in the movement for provincial autonomy led by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the then leader of the Pakistan Awami <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">League, who announced Six-Points Programmes</span> on 18<sup>th</sup> March, 1966 at the Pakistan Council in Lahore. Being subjected to subjugation and discrimination, the students of East Pakistan All-Party Action Committee became discontented and launched Eleven-Points demands and raised their support to the cause, which led to the Mass Movement of 1969. In the General Election of 1970, there was a massive victory for the Bangalees under the leadership of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in which Awami League won a landslide election victory having all but two seats of the then Provincial Assembly of East Pakistan and gained majority in the National Assembly of Pakistan. There is no need to repeat the history but suffice it to say that the Rulers of Pakistan could not accept the Awami League as the majority party in the National Assembly to form the Central Government. The Session of Parliament convened on 3<sup>rd</sup> March,1971 was abruptly cancelled which prompted sharp reaction among the people of the then East Pakistan resulting ultimately to a Non-Co-Operation Movement under the leadership of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. In his historical<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>and inspirational speech<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>on 7<sup>th</sup> March,1971 at the Race Course Maidan, Dhaka, Bangabandhu called upon the people of the country to be united and declared that </span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: SutonnyBanglaMJ;">ÔÔGev‡ii msMÖvg Avgv‡`i gyw³i msMÖvg, Gev‡ii msMÖvg ¯^vaxbZvi msMÖvgÕÕ</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> (“ Our struggle this time is a struggle for emancipation, the struggle this time is a struggle for independence.”) In the historical speech he gave a guideline to the nation how to proceed with the historic struggle for national liberation which ultimately culminated in his declaration of independence on 26<sup>th</sup> March, 1971 followed by the war of national liberation. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 6pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">30.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">Speaking about the constitutional development of Bangladesh, vesting of judicial power in the judiciary of Bangladesh, and the establishment of the High Court of Bangladesh and the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, one has to recall the historical events which led to the declaration of independence followed by war of liberation, Proclamation of Independence on 10<sup>th</sup> April, 1971 at Mujibnagar, Kushtia and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>the Laws Continuance Enforcement Order 1971 dated 10<sup>th</sup> April,1971, formation of a Provisional Government of Bangladesh on 17<sup>th</sup> April,1971 at Mujibnagar, Kushtia.

We the judges of the Supreme Court<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>can take judicial notice of the fact that the Supreme Court of Bangladesh has been functioning in succession in its permanent site in the then Governor House of the Province of East Bengal and Assam which is fully demarcated and specified by specially designed<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>boundary wall with grille fencing since November, 1947 as<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">   </span>the High Court of East Bengal, then the High Court of East Pakistan and finally as the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. It is very unfortunate to note the unusual situation where the land belonged to the Supreme Court of Bangladesh by succession has not been recorded in its name or in the name of its predecessors the High Court of East Bengal or the then High Court of East Pakistan. Having faced with this unusual situation, we are duty bound to invoke extra ordinary power of this Division under Article 104 of the Constitution to do complete justice for the purpose of production of the original files and records of the then High Court of East Bengal and the Supreme Court of Bangladesh regarding its establishment as to the place of sitting of the High Court of East Bengal pursuant to Article 11 of the High Courts (Bengal) Order, 1947 for examination and perusal. On careful perusal of the original files and records of the English Department (1E-20/49) of the High Court of East Bengal, it appears that the place of sitting of the High Court was selected by the Chief Justice in consultation with and with the approval of the then Governor of East Bengal which is evident from different correspondences of the English Department (1E-20/49) of the High Court of East Bengal. In this context, we would like to profitably reproduce a letter from the then Secretary, Judicial and Legislative Department, Government of East Bengal under Memo No.3079-J dated Dacca, the 8<sup>th</sup> July,1949 to the Registrar, High Court, Dacca which reads as under:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;

It was revealed from the record that the then Registrar of the High Court by Memo No.6442 G dated 23<sup>rd</sup> November,1950 wrote to the Secretary, Judicial Department, Government of East Bengal stating that the provisions of law quoted in the letter under reference does not require the issue of any notification and that what is required under that provision has been done and the then Chief Justice took the approval of His Excellency the Governor for locating the High Court at Dacca and the High Court was formally opened by His Excellency the Governor on the 17<sup>th</sup> November,1947 at the then Governor House of the Province of East Bengal and Assam, along with the adjacent area of land which was specifically demarcated and identified by specially designed boundary wall with grille fencing, and the Court formed the opinion that there was no further need of a notification /publication for notifying the place of sitting of the High Court inasmuch as<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>the same was <span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt;">already within the domain of public knowledge.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">61.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">We have also perused several notes in the original files of the then High Court of East Bengal and found the location of its place of sitting, which comprised the Old High Court Building and its adjoining area (Governor House), and the establishment of the High Court of East Bengal was approved by His Excellency the Governor within the knowledge of the Chief Minister at that time. But there was no sufficient accommodation in the Old High Court Building and it was felt that proper accommodation should be provided for housing the High Court of East Bengal and in this regard series of correspondences were made between the Office of the Registrar, High Court of East Bengal and the Judicial and Legislative Department of the Government of East Bengal, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the Public Works Department of the Government. It also appears from the record that the then Government of East Bengal was informed that the High Court does not consider the issue of the suggested notification necessary. From a clear reading of Article 11 of the aforesaid Order 1947 we are also of the view that it did not require a Gazette Notification to be issued appointing “Dacca” or any specific area within “Dacca” as the place of sitting of the High Court of East Bengal.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">62.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">We have already noticed that the High Court of East Bengal was established in the Governor House, which was also known as the New Government House. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 6pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">63.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The building of the Governor House in which the High Court of East Bengal was inaugurated, did not have sufficient space to accommodate the Court Rooms, Chambers of the learned Judges, different sections of the Court, Judges Library and also accommodation for the Bar Association Library, Car Park, Canteens for the Staff as well as the Canteens for the Members of the Bar. Facing with this situation, the Government initiated a Master Plan for the complex to accommodate High Court of East Bengal, Provincial Assembly Building, Secretariat and other officials of the Government. The Office of the Consulting Architect (C &amp; B), Directorate, Government of East Bengal worked hard to make a Master Plan for the site of the East Bengal Legislative Assembly, East Bengal High Court and the Secretariat, etc. The Consulting Architect also wanted to know from the High Court about the requirement of space to accommodate Court rooms, Offices etc. However the said idea of construction of a complex could not succeed due to the paucity of space and the need of Bar Association Library, etc was a burning issue for the judiciary. Facing with these multifarious problems, the successive Chief Justices of the High Court of East Pakistan made series of correspondences with the then Government of East Pakistan to do the needful for the construction of New High Court Building within its premises specified and demarcated by specially designed boundary wall with grille fencing. In that view of the matter the Registrar of the High Court East Pakistan wrote to the Government Architect, East Pakistan on 10<sup>th</sup> October, 1959 to construct a New High Court Building under Five-Years Plan setting out details of the proposed Court Building which should be three-storied or more with three lifts one for the Judges and others for the litigant people, the members of the Bar and the staff. The said letter described the requirements of Court Rooms and Chambers of the Hon’ble Chief Justice and other Judges of the High Court, Meeting Hall which should be centrally situated so as to be accessible to all the Hon’ble Judges and Court Rooms to sit round at Full Court Meetings. There should be Library for Judges with adequate number of staff, Chambers for Gazetted Officers, Record Room, the English Office, First Appeal Section, Supreme Court Appeal Section, Second Appeal Section, Original Section, Paper Book Department consisting of three branches, (namely, Inspection Section, Paper Book Section and Civil Translation Section) Rule Section, Accounts Section, Stamp Reporter’s and Filing Section, General, Establishment &amp; Dispatch Section, Bench Section, Decree Section, Central Copying Section, Bench Clerks and Assistant Bench Clerks, Transcription Room, Translation Section, Original Side, Writ Section, Committee of Legal Education, Court Keeper’s Department, Lavatories and Urinals should be provided for the Court Staff, and sufficient number of separate lavatories and urinals for the litigant public including the Advocates’ Clerks and others at some distance from those meant for the Courts Staff, Bar Library, Law Officers of Government and their offices, Supreme Court Branch Registry, Prayer Hall, Canteens, Employees’ Recreation Room and Library, Post Office, Court Sergeant, Garages, Residential Accommodation with sufficient accommodation for Court Keepers and the Assistant Court Keepers with suitable family quarter within the court compound. Provisions may also be made in the plan for residential accommodation of a skeleton staff, namely the <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">Registrar, Deputy Registrar, two Superintendents</span> and 4 Assistants of the Court who may be available in the Court premises for any emergent business. In this connection the Registrar also refers to earlier correspondences made with the Government by the then High Court vide letter No.2670 G dated 23<sup>rd</sup> April 1951 to the Chief Secretary, to the Government of East Bengal vide letter No.1147 T.P. dated 05.06.1951 from the Additional Assistant Secretary, Government of East Bengal, C.B. &amp; I.

Following this letter, the Registrar of the High Court wrote to the Supreme Court of Pakistan, Lahore on 20.04.1960 requesting them to inform the High Court the requirements of the Supreme Court in respect of the accommo-dation to be provided for High Court of East Pakistan so as to enable this Court to send a reply to the Government of East Pakistan. However, the Supreme Court of Pakistan vide Memo No.F.14 / 13 / 59-SCA dated 30.04.1960 replied to the Registrar-in-Charge, High Court of East Pakistan stating that plans for the construction of the separate building for the Supreme Court of Pakistan at Dhaka have been finalized and steps had been taken by the Pakistan P.W.D. to acquire a plot in Shahbagh area already reserved for the building and accordingly<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>High Court of East Pakistan will not be required by Supreme Court of Pakistan. <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">Thereafter, the Registrar-in-Charge on 07.05.1960</span> informed the Government of East Pakistan, Works, Housing and Settlement (C &amp; B) Department, Development Branch forwarding a copy of the Supreme Court letter dated 30.04.1960.

It is our proud privilege to observe that the Supreme Court of Bangladesh is a creature of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. But its origin can be traced back to the then High Court of East Bengal which was later on renamed as the High Court of East Pakistan, and after the independence of Bangladesh through a historic struggle for national Liberation and the constitutional development of the emergence of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and the enactment of the Constitution, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh by operation of law got all powers and jurisdictions along with physical infrastructures and properties from its predecessors. Under the constitutional dispensation, Article 94(1)mandates that there shall be a Supreme Court for Bangladesh to be known as Supreme Court of Bangladesh comprising the Appellate Division and the High Court Division. Article 95(3) of the Constitution provides that in this article, “Supreme Court” includes a Court which at any time before the commencement of this Constitution, exercised jurisdiction as a High Court in the territory of Bangladesh. Therefore, there should not be any doubt in the mind of anybody to acknowledge, understand and admit that the High Court of East Bengal renamed as the High Court of East Pakistan by operation of law paved the way for the establishment of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh by operation of law after liberation of Bangladesh; that the entire area demarcated by boundary wall of the Governor House or the New Government House in which the High Court of East Bengal was established on 17.11.1947 comprising an area of 55.05 acres of land and subsequently within the compound of the High Court of East Pakistan towards its north-east side the New High Court Building constructed by the then Government was formally inaugurated by the President of Pakistan on 24<sup>th</sup> September,1968. Since 17.11.1947, nobody raised any objection about the location and total area of the High Court of East Bengal and thereafter the Supreme Court of Bangladesh till such time when Extra-Constitutional phenomenon prevailed in the country when in the South-Western part of the Supreme Court premises an area of 1.32 acres was purportedly leased out<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>without lawful authority to the Shishu Academy on which a building was constructed in 1977 and thereafter 2.108 acres was also purportedly leased out on 30.12.1989 without lawful authority. The building of the Department of Roads and Highways was illegally constructed to the northern side of the compound of the Supreme Court in early 1980s. Nobody can deny the establishment of the High Court of East Bengal in the Governor House which was ultimately succeeded by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh after the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent and sovereign nation. Admittedly the Supreme Court of Bangladesh has been functioning in its permanent site situated in the erstwhile Governor House, Dhaka.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>A mere a mistake<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>or an inadvertent omission of entry in the record of rights in respect of the land of the Supreme Court in the S.A., R.S. and Dhaka City Settlement operation<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">   </span>would not affect the right, title and interest of the Supreme Court in respect of the land in question in view of the historical perspective, constitutional development of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh and other historical documents /correspondences elaborately discussed herein above.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 6pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">77.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The Supreme Court of Bangladesh being the Apex Court of the country is an institution created by the Constitution which by operation of law is a successor of the High Court of East Bengal and the High Court of East Pakistan. To our utter surprise and dismay, we have observed that the concerned Departments of the Government and also the Authorities of the then High Court of East Bengal and subsequently, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh could not take proper steps in recording the name of the High Court or the Supreme Court in the S.A., R.S. and D.M.S. operation. On the other hand, it is unfortunate to note that some portion of the land of the Supreme Court was recorded in the name of the Department of Construction and Building (C &amp; B) or Public Works Department, Department of Roods and High ways and Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka and Shishu Academy after the purported lease in its name. In this scenario, can it be said that the then High Court of East Bengal and ultimately the Supreme Court of Bangladesh do not have any land or, more specifically, place of sitting. Can any one deny the very existence of the then High Court of East Bengal/East Pakistan or the Supreme Court of Bangladesh within the territory comprising the present Bangladesh. We are constrained to observe that any such assertion would create constitutional deadlock. All the constitutional documents prior to the enactment the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and ultimately the Constitution in unequivocal terms declares that there shall be a Supreme Court for Bangladesh to be known as the Supreme Court of Bangladesh comprising the Appellate Division and the High Court Division. In the foregoing discussions, we have found that the then High Court of East Bengal was established in the Governor House or the Government House. In other words, the entire area of the Governor House specified and demarcated by specially designed boundary wall with grille fencing is the land of the Supreme Court. It is true that according to Section 103(B)(5) of the Bengal Tenancy Act every entry in a record of right finally published shall be the evidence of the matter referred to in such entry and shall be presumed to be correct until it is proved to be incorrect [Akrab Ali and others –Vs- Zahiruddin Kari and others, 30 DLR (AD) 81] In this reported decision, D.C.

Admittedly, the major portion of the land of the Supreme Court has been under possession and control of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh wherein the Supreme Court Old Building, Main Building, Annex Building of the Supreme Court, Supreme Court Mazar and Mazar Mosjid, different Offices/Sections of the Supreme Court, Staff quarters and compound of the Supreme Court have been located. We have already taken judicial notice of the development of the Supreme Court by operation of law since 1947 and found that at no point of time there was any initiative taken by the Government or the Supreme Court Authority to correct the record of rights in the same of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. In the instant case, the entire land was erroneously recorded in the name of the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka, Department of Construction and Building (C &amp; B), the Department of Roads and Highways and the Shishu Academy without any legal basis. In veiw of the constitutional development of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh and the historical documents/correspondences perused and discussed herein above, the writ petitioner-respondents have been able to successfully rebut the presumption of correctness of the record of rights in the names of other Organizations or Departments, because of the continuous possession and control of the Supreme Court on the major portion of the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>land of the Supreme Court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>When the Supreme Court of Bangladesh has been in continuous ownership and possession of its land and structures thereon, mere recording of the land erroneously in the names of other organizations or Departments would not by itself entitle them to claim ownership or control over the land in question and therefore the lease purported to have been granted by these Departments in favour other organizations or bodies would not transfer any title in favour of them. At any point of time, the then Government<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>of East Pakistan had not taken any initiative to lease out any portion of the land<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>or to construct any building for other Departments or organizations on the premises of the High Court of East Pakistan. The High Court of East Bengal or East Pakistan had been established with the permission of the Governor of East Bengal in the Governor House or the Government House comprising an area of 55.05 acres of land appertaining to the C.S.

The relevant files and documents in respect of establishment of the High Court of East Bengal submitted by the respondent No.7, the Registrar, which fully corroborates that subject land belongs to the Supreme Court of Bangladesh and the concerned Departments of the Government acknowledge the same by their conduct at different stages since 17.11.1947. When the Governor of East Bengal in presence of the then Chief Minister of the Province, the Chief Justice and his companion judges of the High Court of East Bengal, Members of the High Court Bar, Civil Servants and elites of the Country granted the land of the Governor House to the High Court of East Bengal followed by their presence in the opening ceremony of the High Court corroborates the contention of the Registrar. The National Eidgah Maidan within the premises of the Supreme Court was opened with the permission of the then Chief Justice to use the land as Eidgah Maidan for offering Eid Prayers twice in a year without any other activities. It is also brought to our notice that at the time of construction of the Office of the Bangladesh Bar Council, the Ministry of Land advised the Bangladesh Bar Council, to seek permission from the Chief Justice of Bangladesh for construction of their Office Building on the land of the Supreme Court and, accordingly, on the prayer of the Bangladesh Bar Council, the then Chief Justice permitted them to construct their Office Building on a piece of land owned by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. It is also true that as per desire/order of the then Chief Justice of the High Court of East Pakistan, the Bar Association Building had been constructed on the premises of the High Court of East Pakistan, which is now within the premises of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. We have also taken judicial notice of the existence of the Shrine of Hajrat Khaja Sharfuddin Chisti (Ra) on the southern portion of land of the Supreme Court premises. The Chief Justice of Bangladesh as the Chief Custodian of the Bangladesh Supreme Court Mazar Sharif and the Mazar Masjid has to constitute the Supreme Court Mazar and Masjid Administration and Management Committee to administer and manage the affairs of the Mazar Sharif and the adjacent Masjid and look after the interests and welfare of the devotees of the Mazar Sharif and the mussallies of the Masjid. From the foregoing discussions, it is abundantly clear that the Supreme Court has been in continuous ownership, possession and control of the land in question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Mere preparation of record of rights in S.A, R.S. and D.M.S. operation in the name of different Departments and institutions of the Government would not disentitle the Supreme Court of its ownership of the land in question. In the case of the Government of Bangladesh represented by the ADC –vs- AKM Abdul Hye and others 56 DLR (AD) 53, the Appellate Division held that the presumption<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>as regards the entries in the record of rights (R.S. Khatian) so attached under section 144A of the S.A.T. Act,1950 is rebuttable<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>by leading evidence from the side of the person questioning correctness of the entry made <span style="letter-spacing: -.5pt;">therein. The Supreme Court’s continuous ownership</span> and possession has rebutted the presumption of correctness of the record of rights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">      </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 6pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">78.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">Because of the situation prevailing in the country at that time, the then Rulers of the Country without showing any regard to the Constitution and rule of law and without giving any importance to the interest of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh established the Shishu Academy in the South Western-Side and the Office of the Department of Roads and High Ways in the northern-side within the Supreme Court premises which was/is not proper in any way. From the foregoing discussions, it is well established that the then High Court of East Bengal or the High Court of East Pakistan and, finally after the liberation of Bangladesh by operation of law, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh has been the owner of the entire land measuring 55.05 acres of the then Governor House specified and demarcated by specially designed boundary wall with grille fencing. In the facts and circumstances of the case, we have invoked the extra-ordinary power of this Division under Article 104 of the Constitution for doing complete justice in the instant case. This Article does not confer new jurisdiction but it gives power to the Court where it has jurisdiction in a matter before it. When this Court finds that no remedy is available to the present respondent though gross injustice has been committed to it, this Division would definitely invoke the jurisdiction under Article 104 to do complete justice in the matter. In the case of Bangladesh –Vs- Shamironnessa, 2005 BLD (AD) 225, this Division held that recourse to the provisions of Article 104 may be justified when a substantial justice under law and on undisputed facts can be made so that the parties may not be pushed to further litigation. While speaking about complete justice in the case of National Board of Revenue, Dhaka -Vs- Nasrin Banu and 5 others (1996) 48 DLR (AD) 171 at page 178 paragraph 26, this Division observed:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">         </span>"The words "complete justice" do not yield precise definition.

It confers very wide powers on this Division to do complete justice in a matter pending before it. In the case of Khandker Jillul Bari -Vs- The State 2009 BLT (AD) 28 this Division held that it's exclusive power under Article 104 of the Constitution applies as special and extraordinary jurisdiction to avoid miscarriage of justice by establishing complete justice and that this extraordinary power has been given to it and not to the High Court Division. The object of this Article is to enable this Division to give such directions or pass such orders as necessary to do complete justice. This inherent power has been conferred upon this Division to do the right and to undo the wrong and to act ex-debito justicia to do the real and substantial justice for which they exist. The conferment of power is under special circumstances and for special reasons. Article 104 gives a power to this Division where it has jurisdiction but it does not confer a new jurisdiction. In the case of Raziul Hasan -Vs- Bodiuzzaman Khan and others 16 BLD (AD) (1996) 253 this Division held that when it is found that a gross injustice has been done to the appellant for no fault or laches of his own and a valuable right accrued to him is being lost and no other remedy is available to him for redress of his grievance, this Division found it to be a fit case to exercise its jurisdiction under Article 104 of the Constitution for doing complete justice.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-indent: 24pt; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">62...............................................................</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-indent: 24pt; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">63.

Mere failure on the part of the Supreme Court Administration or the concerned Department of the Government in recording the name of the High Court of East Pakistan or the Supreme Court of Bangladesh in the record-of-rights during the S.A, R.S. and the D.M.S. Operations will not disentitle the Supreme Court from its right, title, interest and possession of the land. It is the historical truth and the admitted fact that the entire area of the land of the Governor House or the New Government House of the Province of East Bengal and Assam belonged to the then High Court of East Bengal/East Pakistan and subsequently, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, though some portions of the land was illegally occupied by some other Departments or institutions of the Government without the permission of the Supreme Court Authority because of the situation prevailing in the country at that time. We have found that the High Court of East Bengal was established in the Governor House or the Government House with the approval of the then Governor of East Bengal within the knowledge of the then Chief Minister of East Bengal<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>in as much as the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>successive Constitutions<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">   </span>of Pakistan and ultimately the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, other laws of the country and materials on record testify and guarantee the very existence of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh in its permanent site,i.e., the then Governor House, Dhaka. We also take judicial notice of the fact that initially on 17.11.1947, the High Court of East Bengal was formally opened in the then Governor House or the Government House by the Governor of East Bengal in presence of the then Chief Minister and other Ministers of the Province, the Chief Justice and his companion judges of the High Court of the East Bengal, Members of the High Court Bar including its President, Shere-Bangla A.K. Fazlul Huq, Civil Servants and elites of the Country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We are of the view that the Constitution of Bangladesh testifies the very existence of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, which has been functioning very much in its permanent site in the Governor House by succession since the establishment of the High Court of East Bengal in 1947. “The New High Court Building” which is presently known as the “Main Building of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh” was constructed in 1968 on the premises of the then High Court of East Pakistan and presently the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. From the foregoing discussions, <span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt;">the irresistible conclusion is that the Constitution</span> of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh which is the supreme law of the land and an instrument of the highest standing recognizes, testifies and guarantees the very existence of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh with its premises located in its permanent site, i.e., the then Governor House/New Government House, Dhaka. No one raised any objection at any point of time about the very existence of the Supreme Court in its permanent site or the ownership of the entire land on which the Supreme Court has been established.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">82.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Mere construction of a building on a portion of the land of the Supreme Court by a Department or organization without the permission of the Supreme Court or even purported grant of a lease of a portion of a land of the Supreme Court by an unauthorized person or Department without lawful authority in the name of Shishu Academy or the Department of Roads and High Ways or the construction of the Building of the Department of Roads and High ways therein does not create any title to the land in favour of those Departments or organizations. It is an incorrect proposition to state that since the land of the High Court of East Bengal and, subsequently after the emergence of Bangladesh, the land of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh has not been recorded in its name during the S.A. the R.S. or the D.M.S. operations, the Supreme Court loses its right, title, interest and possession of the land in question. We have taken judicial notice of the events and developments since the establishment of the High Court of East Bengal in 1947 till the inauguration of the New High Court Building of the then East Pakistan by the President of Pakistan in 1968 and, subsequently after liberation of Bangladesh, the establishment of the High Court of Bangladesh and, finally, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh and the laying of the foundation stone of the Supreme Court Annex Building in 1998 and inauguration of the Annex Building by the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina in 2001. It is immaterial whether the property was recorded in the name of the Supreme Court or not, facts remain that the land in question belongs to the Supreme Court of Bangladesh comprising an area of 55.05 acres with little interruption on a small portion of land to the south-west side of the Supreme Court premises in the name of Shishu Academy and another portion of land to the northern side in the name of the Department Roads and High Ways. Having gone through the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division we have found that the High Court Division considered the materials on record and having heard the submissions of all the parties rightly made the Rule absolute by holding that the “exclusive possession and control by the then High Court of East Pakistan creates irrefutable presumption to establish the fact that it was the East Pakistan High Court that was vested with the Bharat Samrat’s said property which stood for the Governor House, in its entirety” and that “the land now occupied by the Department of Roads and Highways, as well as by the Shishu Academy are actually the land of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh which inherited the same by operation of law, from the then East <span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt;">Pakistan High Court. From foregoing discussion</span> and finding, we are convinced to hold that the writ respondents-petitioners are possessing the lands without any lawful authority.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">83.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">Article 104 of the Constitution provides that the Appellate Division shall have power to issue such directions, orders, decrees or writs as may be necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it.

The High Court Division rightly found that the exclusive possession of the chunk of land was first granted to the Governor House and then to the High Court of East Bengal and then by operation of law to the Supreme Court of Bangladesh by way of succession. It has been noticed that the Government vide Memo No.3042 dated 17.09.1968 has already acknowledged that the whole area of the premises of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh comprising of 50 acres of land(approximately). This corroborates the case of the Writ Petitioners. On perusal of the materials on record it appears that the graveyards of the “Three National Leaders” and the Institution of Engineers Bangladesh with structures there-on was constructed on the land of the Supreme Court. Apart from that a portion of land of the Supreme Court premises to the south-eastern side is being used, with the permission of the Chief Justice, as the National Eidgah Maidan for holding Eid Prayers twice in a year under the management of the City Corporation. It is also on the record that the then Chief Justice of Bangladesh permitted the Bangladesh Bar Council to construct their Office Building on a portion of land to the north-eastern side of the Supreme Court premises. In view of the foregoing findings and observations, we are invoking the power under Article 104 of the Constitution to do complete justice in holding that the land recorded in the name of Bharat Samrat under C.S.
