(6)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Lawyers Involved: </strong><br/>Mihir Kanti Majumder, Advocate instructed by A. K. M. Shahidul Huq, Advocate-on-Record-For the Petitioner.<br/>Not represented-the Respondents.<br/> <br/><strong>Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.610 of 2007 </strong><br/>(From the judgment and order dated the 14th day of January, 2007 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.103 of 1994).<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong><u>Mohammad Fazlul Karim J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This petition for leave to Appeal is directed  against the judgment and order dated 14.01.2007 passed by the High Court  Division in Civil Revision No.103 of 1994 making the Rule absolute setting aside the judgment and decree dated 06.02.1993 passed by the Subordinate Judge (Joint District Judge), Bagerhat in Title Appeal No.14 of 1989 revers­ing those dated 27.12.1988 passed by the Assistant Judge, Chitalamari in Title Suit No.11 of 1987 decreeing the suit for partition.<br/> <br/>2. The facts of the case, in short, are that suit schedule lands belonged to original owner Mritunjoy who died leaving behind seven sons namely, Debicharan, Bani Kanta Troilakshya Nath, Totaram, Baroda, Sarat Chandra and Satish Chandra. Among them Totaram died leaving four sons namely, Kalipada,  Bhupen,  Dhiren and the plaintiffs, Birendra and among them Dhiren died unmarried leaving there  brothers and thus plaintiffs inherited 1/3rd  of 1/7th equivalent to 1.07 acres of land of Mritunjoy's property and further case of the plaintiff is  that  Debicharan died leaving behind wife Rashabati alias Jashabati and two daughters namely, Sonamoni  and Moina and then Moina died issueless and Sonamoni died leaving behind one son Gopal, defendant No.14, who inherited the total share 1/7th of  Debicharan and then by a registered  kabala dated 03.05.1976  transferred  3.08 acres of land to the plaintiff for consideration of TK.5,000.00 and then the plaintiff claimed amicable partition of his 4.15 acres of land by inheritance purchase  and  which being  refused filed the suit.<br/> <br/>3. The defendants contested the suit by filing written statement contending, inter-alia, that Debicharan son of original owner Mritunjoy died in 1316 B.S. during life time of father Mritunjoy and Debicharan's wife and two daughters were maintained by Mritunjoy who before his surviving  six sons making joint responsibility of all the surviving sons to maintain the  wife and daughters of deceased sons Debicharan by them and thereafter Mritunjoy died in the year 1330 B.S. and the defendant No.14 never inherited nor possessed any property of Mritunjoy and the plaintiff is entitled  to 1/3rd of 1/6th =1/18th share in the suit property by way of inheritance only and the defendant No.14 had no saleable right, title and interest and possession to transfer 3.08 acres of land to the plaintiff and S.A. records of the suit property was correct and the suit was filed for partition without proper cause of action and therefore, prayed for dismissal of the suit.<br/> <br/>4. Mr. Mihir Kanti Majumder, learned Advocate, appearing for the petitioners submitted that the appellate Court below by traversing all the material issues on facts and law reversed the findings of the trial Court and came to its independent findings that the plain­tiff failed to prove that Debicharan died after his father's death and state­ments of D.W.2 as old man of the same dynasty along with C.S. Khatians and the circumstances proved beyond doubt that during C.S. operation Debicharan was dead and his father Mritunjoy was alive and such findings of the appellate Court does not suffer from any infirmity or misreading or non-consideration of material evi­dences; that the High Court Division fell into and error of law in restoring the trial Court's judgment and decree setting aside those of the appellate Court disregarding that in revisional jurisdiction High Court Division can­not interfere with the findings of facts arrived by the appellate Court as a final Court of fact except under excep­tional and defined ground on evidently perverse findings of facts not based on materials on record which has not been justified by the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division; that the High Court Division commit­ted a grave error of law by not affirming the appellate Court's well grounded findings that there is nothing on record to prove that the defendant No.14 ever had exercised his right, title and possession in the suit property  before making transfer of the same by exhibit-10 and wrongly found his saleable right without adverting to the total evidence on record; that the findings of the appellate Court as to fact of death of Debicharan before death of his father is a strong inference from the C.S. record which is immune from any interference by the revisional jurisdiction and irresistibly led to infer that the defendant No. 14 did not inherit from the property of Mritunjoy.<br/> <br/>5. It appears from the record that Mritunjoy died leaving behind seven sons including Debicharan who died afterwards. P.W.’S 2-5, corroborated the evidence of P.W.1. After considering the evidence of record the trial Court rightly came to a definite finding that Debicharan died after the death of his father Mritunjoy. The evidence of all those P.W.'s are consistent, uniform and corroborative with each other with all material particulars,<br/> <br/>6. The High Court Division held that it is a settled principle of law that the appellate Court below being final Court of fact will have to discuss and reassess the evidence of record independently  while  either reversing  of  affirming the finding of the trial Court. In a case of reversal it is more incumbent upon the appellate Court to reassess the evidence on record and to arrive at his own independent findings. In the instant case, the specific findings of the trial Court have not been reversed by the power appellate Court exercising its appellate jurisdiction under Order XLI, Rule 31 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/> <br/>7. In view of the above, we find no substance in the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
