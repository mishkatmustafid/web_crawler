H. Rahman J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>These two appeals have arisen out of Writ Petition Nos. 238 of 1985 and 239 of 1985 wherein the Rules were discharged by the impugned judgment and order dated 25th June, 1986.<br/> <br/>2. The appellant, Dr. Syed Matiur Rob died during the pendency of these appeals. His heirs are substituted. The appellant's father, late Syed Mojibur Rob, a migrant to this country, served as a Deputy Inspector-General of Police and retired from service in 1958. He acquired, amongst other properties, three houses being holding No. 5 Bakshibazar, Dhaka; House No. 18-A, Road No. 20, Dhanmondi Residen­tial Area and holding No. 219 New Eskaton Road, Dhaka. He died on 6.12.1971 in Dhaka leaving the appellant and his only son and heir since his wife and his only daughter Sohani Rob had died earlier. He was buried on 6.12.1971 at the Mohammadpur graveyard. A certificate dated 17.12.1977 issued by the Secretary of Mohammadpur Jame Masjid and Eidgha (Annexure—A) was annexed to the Writ peti­tion to show the date of the burial.<br/> <br/>3. The appellant came to this country in 1947 with his parents. He passed M B B S Examination in 1955 and from then on he served in various insti­tutions and hospitals in this country. He inherited all the properties of his father, but the respondents ille­gally treated two properties in question as abandoned properties under Bangladesh Abandoned Property (Control, Management &amp; Disposal) Order (P.O. No. 16 of 1972) on a false plea that his father went to Pakistan in 1971 and died there in 1978. He applied to the Sub-Divisional Officer, Dhaka on 29.4.1972 for release of the properties, but, in spite of the recommendation of the Sub-Divisional Officer, the Government did not release the properties Several inquiries were made by various agencies of the Gov­ernment as to whether the appellant was the only son of his father and whether Dr. Syed Mohibur Rob was a son of Syed Mojibur Rob. The appellant's case is that Dr. Syed Mohibur Rob was an adopted son of his father and left for Pakistan after indepen­dence of the country. In support of his contention the appellant annexed to his Writ petition a succes­sion-certificate (Annexure-B) with respect to some debts sought to be collected by him; a photostat copy of a death-certificate (Annexure-D) of his father from a doctor showing that he died on 6.12.1971 due to heart failure. As the only heir of his father the ap­pellant sold his father's house at 5 Bakshibazar, Dhaka to one Mrs. Sahera Khatun. That property was also treated as an abandoned property, but on an application filed by Mrs. Sahera Khatun under Arti­cle 102 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh the High Court Division declared that the said property was not an abandoned property and directed the Government to release the same. The ap­pellant contended that the question whether he was the only son and heir of the deceased Syed Mojibur Rob was finally settled in that Writ petition. On 22.5.1985 the appellant requested the Government to release his father's properties from the list of the abandoned properties, but by the letter dated 30.5.1985 the Section Officer in the Ministry of Public Works and Urban Development of the Gov­ernment turned down his request.<br/> <br/>4. The case of respondent No. 1, the Govern­ment of Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Public Works and Urban Development, is that the appellant filed the two Writ petitions with malafide intention to grab the properties which had been legally taken over under P.O. 16 of 1972. It was denied that Syed Mojibur Rob died in Dhaka on 6th December, 1971 and was buried in the graveyard at Mohammadpur. The appellant was an adopted son of Syed Mojibur Rob and as such he had no right or interest in the properties in question. The death cer­tificate was obtained long after the death of Syed Mojibur Rob. The succession- certificate was ob­tained by the appellant on misrepresentation of facts by abusing the process of the Court. That Syed Moj­ibur Rob left Bangladesh during the liberation move­ment and that it is gathered from the photo copy of a letter dated 19.4.76 of Syed Mojibur Rob addressed to Mr. Ali Hafiz, retired Deputy Secretary, Finance, of 6 Bakshibazar Road, Dhaka, that Mojibur Rob died in Karachi in 1978 leaving behind his only son Dr. Mohibur Rob and a daughter Sohani Rob as his legal heirs who were living at 59 Alhamara Housing Society Karachi-8 Pakistan, and that Syed Mojibur Rob or his heirs having ceased to manage, supervise and control the properties in question personally they were rightly treated as abandoned properties.<br/> <br/>5. The case of Provati Biddya Nikctan, Re­spondent No. 4 in Writ petition No. 239 of 1985, is that the appellant's petition was not maintainable; that the impugned letter dated 30.5.85 written by re­spondent No. 1 under the signature of the Section Officer of the Ministry concerned in reply to the ap­pellant's letter dated 22.5.1985 did not create any cause of action under Article 102 of the Constitution as revived under the Chief Martial Law Administra­tor's Order No. 1 of 1985; that the petition was hit under the provision of Martial Law Regulation No. 7 of 1977; that the house situated at 219 New Eskaton, Dhaka has been treated as an abandoned property since 1972; that it was allotted to New Eskaton Pri­mary School; that after receiving a grant from the President the school constructed the first floor of its building and thereafter applied to the government for purchasing the house on hire-purchase-basis and the Government decided to sell the house to the respon­dent on terms and conditions as stipulated in the let­ter dated 1.11.84 (Annexure VII to the affidavit-in- opposition of respondent No.4). Respondent No.4 deposited a sum of Tk.1,17,108.56 on 9.11.1985 be­ing the first instalment of the consideration money and had also deposited first instalment of arrear rents amounting to Tk. 91,000/-on 2.11.1985. Respon­dent No. 4 asserted that the school is a bonafide pur­chaser of the property, and its right and interest to the property can not be questioned after 14 years and that the school is functioning as a High School since 1980 and it cannot be evicted in this summary proceeding.<br/> <br/>6. Along with his affidavit-in-reply the appel­lant filed a certified copy of the proceedings before the S D O for release of the properties and a copy of the enquiry report made by the Director, N S I., Dha­ka, with regard to the claim of the appellant. In the midst of the Hearing of the Writ petition the appel­lant filed a supplementary affidavit annexing with it a copy of the declaration allegedly made by Syed Mojibur Rob on 24.12.1969. Respondent No. 4 in Writ Petition No. 239 of 1985 challenged the genu­ineness of that declaration by filing a supplementary affidavit. After the hearing of the case was concluded the appellant filed a supplementary affidavit annex­ing with it a photostat copy of a certificate dated 24.5.1986 from the Principal of Dhaka Medical Col­lege to the effect that Syed Matiur Rob, son of late Syed Mojibur Rob, was admitted in Dhaka Medical College in December 1949 as first year student and that he passed M B B S Examination in April, 1955. On the other hand, respondent No.1 filed a supple­mentary affidavit annexing with it a photostat copy certificate dated 17.6.1986 from the Principal of Dhaka Medical College to the effect that Dr. Syed Mohibur Rob, son of Syed Mojibur Rob was admit­ted in Dhaka Medical College in October, 1947 as first year student and he passed the M B B S Exami­nation in 1952. In view of these new papers the High Court Division again heard the learned Advo­cates for the parties.<br/> <br/>7. The appellant's assertions that Syed Mojibur Rob died in Dhaka on 6.12.1971 and he was buried in Mohammadpur graveyard; that appellant is the only son and heir of Syed Mojibur Rob; that Mohi­bur Rob was the adopted son of his father; and that his sister and mother died before Syed Mojibur Rob were seriously challenged by the respondents. After relying on <em><strong>Abdur Rahman Khan Vs. Deputy Com­missioner, Jessore, PLD 1968 Dhaka 367, Tanbir Ahmed Siddiky Vs. Province of East Pakistan, PLD 1968 (SC) 185, Presiding Officer Vs. Sadruddin Ansari, PLD 1967 (SC) 569, Basanka Lal Banik Vs. Is­lamic Republic of Pakistan, 1969 SCMR 283 </strong></em>the High Court Division refused to decide the disputed facts, refrained from making any comment upon the papers produced by the parties and opined that the pe­titioner might seek relief in a properly constituted civil suit.<br/> <br/>8. The High Court Division held that the prin­ciple of res judicata in writ matters where the deci­sions are made in a summary proceeding mostly on affidavits should not be applied with the same strict­ness as in disputes in suits or proceedings determined in civil courts. The High Court Division however referred to <em><strong>Daryao and others Vs. State of U P and others AIR 1961 (SC) 1457</strong></em> wherein it was held that if a writ application is decided on merits as a contest­ed matter the decision will operate as a res judicata in a subsequent Writ petition.<br/> <br/>9. In Writ Petition No. 682 of 1980 it was de­cided that Syed Mojibur Rob died on 6th December, 1971; that his only son and heir Dr. Matiur Rob ob­tained a succession certificate on 19.12.1972; that he never left this country and that he sold his father's property at 5, Bakshi Bazar, Dhaka to the petitioner, Mrs. Sahera Khatun; and, that the house was wrongly included in the list of abandoned properties. In that case there was no affidavit-in-opposition by the Government. The learned Judges observed: "Although the notice of this rule was served upon the Ministry of Public Works and Urban Develop­ment of the Government of Bangladesh being impleaded as respondent No.1 and although Mr. Qazi Shafiuddin, the learned Assistant Attorney-General, has entered appearance and filed power on behalf of the Ministry, according to the learned Assistant At­torney-General notwithstanding the fact that the affi­davit-in- opposition to this Writ petition has been prepared by him, no concerned officer in the Mini­stry of Public Works and Urban Development being respondent No.1 herein has come up to affirm the said affidavit before this court in spite of the persis­tent effort of the learned Assistant Attorney-General concerned. In such circumstances, the statement made in the petition remaining unchallenged and un­disputed as such may be accepted as true. Mr. Qazi Shafiuddin, the learned Assistant Attorney-General has, however, produced before this court the relevant file lying with the Ministry regarding this case and this court had the opportunity of perusing such file."<br/> <br/>10. The bar of <em>res judicata</em> is applicable in Writ proceedings on the general principle that the public interest requires that there should be an end to litigation and that a person should not be vexed twice in respect of the same subject matter. It will, however, depend on the facts of each case whether is­sues in the present proceeding were raised or could have been raised in the previous proceeding and whether the issues raised were earlier decided on mer­its. In the case reported in 1969 SCMR 283 the High Court dealt with the question of the title, of the petitioner. The Supreme Court held the question of title should not be gone into writ jurisdiction of the High Court and the proper remedy of an aggrieved party in a case involving a question of title to prop­erty lies in a regular suit in a civil suit. In dismiss­ing the petition for special leave to appeal the Su­preme Court observed that any finding or observation of the learned Judges of the High Court with regard to the question of title should not be binding in any court in any suit that might be insti­tuted by the petitioner. That observation is to be un­derstood in the facts of that case. Many new issues have been raised in the present two proceedings namely, whether Dr. Matiur Rob is the adopted son of the deceased Mojibur Rob, whether he is the only heir of the deceased or there are other heirs, son Syed Mohibur Rob and daughter Sohani, who are alive and residing in Pakistan, and whether Syed Mohibur Rob is the adopted son of the deceased. In the judg­ment of Writ Petition No. 682 of 1980 the two properties of the present proceedings were not men­tioned and the appellant Matiur Rob's claim to the properties did not come up directly for consideration. Dr. Matiur Rob was impleaded in the previous pro­ceeding as a proforma respondent and he did not enter appearance in that case. As quite a few new issues have been raised in the present proceedings the earlier decision in Writ Petition No. 682 of 1980 can not be set up as a bar to stop either the Government or respondent No. 4 from challenging the locus standi or claim of the petitioner- appellant that he was the sole heir of the deceased Mojibur Rob.<br/> <br/>11. Reliance is placed on <em><strong>Hazi Waziullah Vs. Addl. Deputy Commissioner 1989 BLD (AD) 135 </strong></em>for the contention that the High Court Division erred in law in not according the evidentiary value to the pre­vious judgment in Writ Petition No. 682 of 1980 as to the status of the petitioner in view of the provi­sion of section 43 read with section 13 of the Evi­dence Act.<br/> <br/>12. The previous judgment is no doubt admis­sible to show the assertion of the petitioner but it cannot bind respondent No.4 nor the Government in view of the fact that the new issues, that have been raised in these cases had no occasion to be considered in the previous proceedings instituted at the instance of a third party where the present appellant himself did not make any assertion as to his status or claim.<br/> <br/>13. The learned Counsel for the appellant has repeatedly pointed out that the High Court Divi­sion's observation that the petitioner may seek reme­dy in Civil Court will be of no help to him because he had, unfortunately, withdrawn Title Suit No. 360 of 1984 from the Court of Subordinate Judge, 3rd Court, Dhaka without permission for the Court to file any suit afresh.<br/> <br/>14. The learned Counsel for respondent No.4 has pointed out that in his Writ petition the appel­lant suppressed the fact that he filed a title suit with regard to the same subject matter; and that after this was pointed out by respondent No.4 in her affidavit-in-opposition, the appellant withdrew his title suit. The appellant's predicament, now pointed out, does not appear to have been brought to the notice of the High Court Division. In any view of the matter, we refrain from making any comment on this aspect of this case. The appellant should be left to the ingen­uity of his learned Counsel for finding any other remedy that may be available to him in law.<br/> <br/>15. In this case leave was, however, granted only to examine whether a mere denial of a fact without having any basis for such denial would ren­der that fact a disputed question of fact incapable of adjudication in Writ Jurisdiction of the High Court Division. We are of the view that a mere denial by the respondent of a fact in issue raised by the peti­tioner in a Writ petition will not render that fact a disputed fact, but if the assertion made by the petitioner is not supported by materials to the satisfac­tion of the Court, the Court may refuse to act on such assertion alone.<br/>Where the respondent denies a fact without adducing convincing material-support of such denial, but the court finds it difficult to draw a definitive inference or conclusion from the assertion of the petitioner then it will be a case where the peti­tioner has failed to discharge his <em>onus probandi</em>.<br/> <br/>16. The nature and the extent of the disputed fact in this case may be exemplified by the document dated 24.12.69, filed after the hearing of the case, and the court heard the matter again. The document is a declaration made by the deceased Rob on 24.12.69 to the effect that "Syed Mohibur Rob was never my son and as such Syed Matiur Rob is my only son and he will inherit all my properties after my death" is not made before any Magistrate or Affidavit Com­missioner. The Court can hardly accept such an uni­lateral declaration without examining at least one of the witnesses to the declaration and the circumstanc­es that gave rise to the occasion for such a declara­tion. The High Court Division correctly refused to act on this declaration in a summary proceeding, par­ticularly, when a certificate from the Principal of Dhaka Medical College, clearly indicated that Dr. Syed Mohibur Rob was the son of Syed Mojibur Rob and that he was admitted in Dhaka Medical Col­lege in 1947 and he passed the M B B S Examina­tion in 1952.<br/> <br/>17. The appellant tried to improve his case stage by stage and filed several documents which were not contemporaneous to the death of the de­ceased or to the date of the filing of Writ petitions. It must be said the High Court Division gave a very patient hearing to the appellant. In a writ proceeding the petitioner is not entitled to make out a case in his affidavit-in-reply. A departure from this norm can only be made in exceptional circumstances for mak­ing complete justice in a matter.<br/> <br/>In view of the above, we dismiss both the appeals, without making any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
