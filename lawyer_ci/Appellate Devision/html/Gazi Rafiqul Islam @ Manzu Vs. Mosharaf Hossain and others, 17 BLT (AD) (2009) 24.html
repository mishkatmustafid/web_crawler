(8)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Lawyers Involved: </strong><br/>A.K.M.Shahidul Huq, Advocate-on-Record-For the Petitioner.<br/>Not represented- the Respondents.<br/> <br/><strong>Civil Petition for leave to Appeal No. 131 of 2006. </strong><br/>(From the judgment and order dated 13.07.2005 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.1162 of 2002)<br/> <br/><strong>JUDGMENT</strong><br/> <br/><strong><u>M. M. Ruhul Amin J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 13.07.2005 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.1162 of 2002 discharging the Rule.<br/> <br/>2. The plaintiffs instituted Title Suit No.77 of 1991 in the Court of Assistant Judge, 4th Additional Court, Dhaka for declaration of title and recovery of khas possession of the suit land as schedule of the plaint stating, inter alia, that the land of C.S. Khatian No.64 originally belonged to 4 brothers namely, Adhar Rishi, Ridhaya Rishi, Mukul Rishi and Joy Gobinda Rishi. Adhar Rishi died leaving behind only daughter Jottashari Rishi. Ridhaya Rishi died leaving behind only son Jodunath Rishi who by Kabala dated 01.08.1985 purchased 4 annas share of Jottashari Rishi and thus Jadunath Rishi became the owner of 8 annas share of the said land. Jadunath transferred the suit land to the plaintiff by kabala dated 29.06.1972 and 09.10.1972. After purchase the plaintiffs got their names mutated in the record of Revenue Department. The last R.S. record was prepared in their names. In the meantime, one Hanif Mia allegedly, a Juba League Leader created collusive kabalas and by dint of those collusive deeds, he dispossessed the plaintiffs on 02.11.1974. Thereafter, Hanif transferred the suit land to defendant Nos.1 and 2 by the so-called registered deed dated 05.12.1977. Hence is the suit.<br/> <br/>3. The defendant Nos.1 and 4 contested the suit by filing two separate written statements denying all the material allegations made in the plaint.<br/> <br/>4. The case of the defendant No.1, in short, is that the suit land originally belonged to 4 brothers namely, Adhar Rishi, Ridhay Rishi, Mukul Rishi and Joy Rishi. Adhar Rishi died leaving behind only daughter Jottashari. Ridhay Rishi died leaving behind only son Jadunath Rishi. Jadunath purchased 4 share of Jottashari by a registered deed dated 01.08.1985 and thus Jadunath became the owner of 8 annas share. Jadunath transferred .09 decimals of land to one Shambhunath. Thereafter,    Shambhunath sold .09 decimals of land to one Hanif Mia by a registered deed dated 29.07.1974. Hanif Mia again sold out the suit land to one Meherjan Nessa by registered deed dated 13.06.1977. Thereafter, Meherjan Nessa sold to defendant No.4 who also purchased .5 decimals of land from Ovin Chandra Das by a registered deed dated 19.04.1982. He also purchased .04 decimals and 6 chataks of land from Nabokumer by registered deeds dated 19, 08.1983, 05.07.1983 and 24.04.1983. In this way he became the owner of 18 decimals 6 chataks of land and has been in peaceful possession of the land.<br/> <br/>5. The trial Court dismissed the suit. On appeal being Title Appeal No.409 of 1992, the Court of appeal allowed the appeal. The defendant Nos.1 and 4 moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained Rule which after hearing   was discharged.<br/> <br/>6. We have heard A.K.M. Shahidul Huq, the learned Advocate-on-Record for the petitioner and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/> <br/>7. It appears that both the trial Court and the appellate Court concurrently held that the plaintiffs have title and possession in the suit land and they were subsequently dispossessed but the trial Court dismissed the suit on the ground of defect of party but the appellate Court did not agree with the trial court on this point and held that the suit is not bad for defect of Party. Accordingly the appellate Court allowed the appeal and decreed the suit.<br/> <br/>8. At the time of hearing the learned Advocate-on-Record appearing for the petitioner could not show whether in the written statement they took the plea of defect of party. The High Court Division further held that the plea of defect of party is to be raised at the earliest stage of the suit. Otherwise such plea should be deemed to have been waived. Accordingly, the High Court Division held that the suit was not bad for defect of parties.<br/>In view of the discussion made above, we are of the view that the High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision.<br/> <br/>9. The learned Advocate-on-Record could not point out any other legal infirmity in the impugned judgment.<br/> <br/>The Petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
