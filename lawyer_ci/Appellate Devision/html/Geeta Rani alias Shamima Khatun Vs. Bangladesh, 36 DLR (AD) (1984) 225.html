Plaintiff appellant brought a suit being O.C. Suit No. 50 of 1977 for declaration of right, title and interest in the suit land in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Rangpur. Her case was that the land in question was owned and possessed by one Gouri Dasi, her mother who was once a prostitute by profession and subsequently gave up and led a married life. She purchased a land in question oat of her own income in 1953. She had been in actual, phy­sical possession of this land till her death on 26.5.76 by paying rent and other taxes to the Pourashava in her name and after her death the plaintiff appellant has been residing there by paying rent and taxes. Plaintiff appellant Geeta Rani Dasi received a notice under sec­tion 92 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act from the Deputy Commissioner, Rangpur as to why the land in question should not be treated as abandoned property and the Govern­ment of Bangladesh would not enter into the khas possession on the death of Gouri Dasi who died intestate. A Misc. Case was started being Case No. 14 of 1975-76 and the plaintiff appellant filed objection and the same was heard by the Deputy Commissioner who by his order expressed the view that the plain­tiff was required to establish her claim by filing a suit in the Civil Court. Hence the suit mentioned above had been filed for dec­laration of right, title and interest.<br/> <br/>3. The suit was contested and the plaintiff led evidence to prove that she was the daugh­ter of Gouri Dasi who died intestate; that the properties belonged to Gouri Dasi is not disputed and documentary evidence is in R. S. Khatian had been adduced to show that the property belonged to Gouri Dasi. The next question was whether the plaintiff was the daughter of Gouri Dasi. The trial court presumed that Gouri Dasi was not married at all and she carried on business, of prostitution till her death. So far the claim of the plaintiff that she was a daughter of Gouri Dasi the learned Subordinate Judge discarded the evi­dence of P.W. 2 Pari Rani Dasi who is also a prostitute on the ground that she had not seen Gouri Dasi give birth to the plaintiff, P.W. 3 Rajab Ali was disbelieved on the ground of his evidence being hearsay e.g. that he heard that the plaintiff was a daughter of Gouri Dasi. The plaintiff's evidence as P.W. I was discarded on the ground that she was an interested witness. On the other hand, the evidence of D.W. 1 Abdur Rouf, Field Kanungo was relied on that Gouri Dasi was a prostitute and she died without any heir. In this view of the matter the suit was dismissed. On appeal the appellate court below considered that the evidence of P.W. 2 that the plaintiff is the daughter of Gouri Dasi is not convinc­ing though without assigning any reason. Evidence of P.W. 3 was simply noticed and the Appellate Court commented: <br/> <br/>"On this scanty evidence I cannot hold that plaintiff is daughter of Gouri Dasi. There is also no convincing evidence to show that Gouri Dasi and Kalipada Das ever lived as husband and wife and that plaintiff Geeta was daughter of Gouri Dasi". <br/> <br/>In this view of the matter the appeal was dis­missed. On revision the High Court Division followed the same seasonings of the appellate Court below namely expressing doubt that Gouri Dasi and Kalipada Das ever lived as husband and wile and that plaintiff Geeta Rani was daughter of Gouri Dasi. It was contended that the plaintiff was not required to prove the valid marriage between Kalipada and Gouri Dasi and then the learned Judges, with respect, made a proposition which needs quotation: <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"But the plaintiff was required to prove that she was born of Gouri Dasi. It is an admitted fact that Gouri Dasi was a prostitute. She may have a child but birth of the child though not the parentage must be proved by cogent evidence. There is no evidence to show that Gouri Dasi gave birth to a child daughter." </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The Learned Judges also discarded the evidence of P.W. 2 as she had no direct know­ledge of Gouri Dasi giving birth to the plaintiff. The learned Judges went on that an inference may, from her state­ment, be made that the plaintiff was treated as a child by Gouri Dasi but this is not enough to claim title by inheritance. In this view of the matter the rule was dis­charged.<br/> <br/>4. Leave was granted to consider the question that the Government of Bangladesh cannot claim the property without follow­ing the procedure in case of intestacy and secondly notwithstanding the evidence of the plaintiff's witnesses the High Court Division erred in not holding that the plaintiff had sufficiently proved the case so as to seek the declaration as prayed for.<br/> <br/>5. To begin with section 92 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act may be noticed. The terms are as follows-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"<strong>92.</strong> (1) The interest of a raiyat in a holding shall be extinguished—<br/>(a) When he dies intestate leaving no heir entitled to inherit under the law of inheritance to which he is subject;<br/>(b) When he surrenders his holding at the end of any agricultural year by giving notice in the prescribed form and in the prescribed manner and within the prescribed period to the Revenue-officer;<br/>(c) When he voluntarily abandons his residence making any arrangement for payment of the rent as it falls due and ceases to cultivate his holding either by himself or by members of his family or by or with the aid of, servants or labourers or with the aid of partners or bargadars for a period of three suc­cessive years;<br/>(d) When such interest has devolved by inheritance, under the law of inheri­tance to which such raiyat is subject, on a person who is not a bona fide cultivator and such person has not cultivated the land comprised in the holding either by himself or by members of his family or by or with the aid of, servants or labourers or with the aid of partners or bargadars during the period of five years from the date on which such interest has so devolved on him and there is no sufficient cause why he has not so cultivated the land. <br/>(2) When the interest of a raiyat in a holding is extinguished under sub­-section (1), the Revenue-Officer may enter on the holding and the holding shall with effect from the date on which the Revenue-Officer so enters on it, vest absolutely in the, Provincial Government free from all encumbrances except the encumbrance on the holding which is extinguished under clause (a) of the said sub-section, but the persons whose interest in the holdings are extinguished under clause (b), (c) and (d) of that sub-section secured by encumbrances on such hol­dings.<br/>(3) Before entering on a holding under sub-section (2) the Re venue-Officer shall cause a notice to be published in the pres­cribed manner declaring his intention to so enter on the holding and speci­fying the reasons thereof and also invi­ting objections from all persons interest­ed in the holding and shall consider any objection that may be submitted to him within the period specified in that behalf in the notice and shall record a decision.<br/>(4) Any person aggrieved by an order passed by the Revenue-Officer under sub-section (3) on any objection shown against the extinguishment of the interest, of any raiyat in his holding under clause (d) of sub-section (1) may, instead of filling an appeal under section 147, insti­tute a suit in the Civil Court against such order. Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, such suit shall be filed within ninety days from the date of the order of the Revenue-Officer under sub-section (31).<br/>(5) All arrears of rent in respect of a holding remaining due from a raiyat whose interest in such holding has been extinguished under sub-section (1) shall be deemed to be irrecoverable". </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The trial court in its judgment mentioned that the defendant Government in its written statement took the plea that since Gouri left no heir, the suit property is escheated to the Government. In India Hindu Succes­sion Act, 1956 has been passed and section 29 deals with the properties when a person died intestate. It runs as under: <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"If an intestate has left no heir quali­fied to succeed to his or her property in accordance with the provisions of this Act, such property shall devolve on the Government; and the Govern­ment shall take the property subject to all the obligations and liabilities to which an heir would have been subject". </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The escheat is an English conception which means the Crown can take over the property when there is no legal heir. An escheat to the Crown was abolished by the Adminis­tration of Estate Act, 1925 instead a right of <em>bona vacantia </em>of was substituted. It was explained in <strong><em>Mitchell Hatton Vs. Jones, 1954 2 ALL ER 246</em></strong> that the words <em>''bona vacantia</em>" in the Administration of Estates Act, 1925 are merely descriptive. The Crown takes directly by succession under that paragraph and not by any prerogative right to ownerless property under which, but for the statute, it would otherwise have taken. It will be erroneous to bring this conception while considering a case in the Codified Law namely the State Acquisi­tion and Tenancy Act. Section 92 opens with the words ''that the interest of a raiyat in holding shall be extinguished (a) when he died intestate leaving no heir entitled to inherit under the law of Inheritance to which he is subject".<br/> <br/>6. The question is whether Gouri Dasi died intestate. If so, whether she has left any heir who is entitled to inherit under the Law of Inheritance to which she is subject. Admittedly she was a Hindu, therefore answer is to be found from the Hindu Law alone and not from any other quarter. As already mentioned in India Hindu Succession Act was passed in 1956 and section 29 makes a provision when there is failure of heir to take the property and only in that event the property devolved upon the Government. Here in this case the plaintiff herself deposed to say that she is the daughter of deceased Gouri Dasi and evidence has been led that she was althrough brought up reared and treated as daughter by Gouri Dasi which led even the learned Judges of the High Court Division to concede when they observed: <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Inference may, from her statement, be made that the plaintiff was treated as a child by Gouri." </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>and then the learned Judges considered: <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"This is not enough to claim title by inheritance. Unfortunately the learned Judges have not spelt out as to what more requirement of law was needed for the plaintiff to claim title by in­heritance." </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It is well established that a prostitute does not sever tie which connect a woman to her kindred. In <strong><em>Sivasangu Vs. Minal, 12 Mad. 277</em></strong> the question was in a competition between the sons and a sister leading a life of prosti­tution who would be the preferential heir to the estate of another deceased sister who was leading a life of prostitute. It was held that the prostitute daughter would be the preferential heir rather than the son. The learned Judges followed the decision in <strong><em>Tara Munnee vs. Motee Buneance, 7S. DA. 273</em></strong> and the principle were answered as follows: <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Following the opinion of the Pundit, the Suddar Deswanney Adalat held that the two prostitutes daughters were alone entitled to inherit what the prostitute mother has left and that the relation of the married and respectable daughter to the outcaste mother had been severed." </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>7. The second proposition was doubted in a later case which will be discussed in appr­opriate place. In this case the defendant Go­vernment of Bangladesh claim the property by way of escheat since Gouri Dasi died intestate without leaving any heir according to it. When the claim is founded on escheat the onus lies on it to show that the owner of the estate died without heir. In <strong><em>Grida Lal Vs. Bengal Government (1868) 12 M.I.A. 448.</em></strong> The Privy Council laid down that the onus is on the Government to show that the last proprietor of land died without heir. This proposition still holds the field and therefore it is too late in the day to take a contrary view. When the plaintiff adduced evidence that she is a daughter of Gouri Dasi and the corroborative evidence that she was treated as daughter by Gouri Dasi throughout, the High Court Division rightly considered that this point could not be assailed but unfortu­nately the learned Judges failed to draw the necessary inference for drawing conclusion from such facts. As against this fact that Gouri Dasi treated the plaintiff as her daughter althrough there is no rebuttal evidence and the <em>ipsi dixit</em> of the respondent that she is not a daughter of Gouri Dasi would be of no use since the onus is on the Government that Gouri Dasi died without heir. This onus was not dischar­ged and the courts below failed to take notice of such onus. The Courts below have unnecessarily considered the question of parentage of the plaintiff. Admitted fact is that Gouri Dasi was a prostitute and she was a Hindu. It is irrelevant to consider whether Gita Rani the plaintiff is a legitimate or illegitimate issue or whether she was off­spring of the marriage between Gouri Dasi and Kalipada Question is which law is to be applicable in this case. Obviously the Hindu law. In the case of <strong><em>Visvanatha Mudali and another Vs. Duraiswami Mudali and ano­ther, A.I.R. 1926 Madrass 289</em></strong> a Division Bench surveyed the entire law on the subject and observed that even in the case of sons of prostitute or dancing woman the paternity is unknown and it is only euphemism to call them illegitimate sons. The Court observed: <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"People who have been in India and who are of the Hindu faith, and whose customs and manners are those of Hin­dus, are governed by the Hindu Law. In the case of a dancing woman or a Hindu prostitute her religion is Hindu and her customs, manners and observa­nce are Hindu and her sons are Hindus, and the Hindu Law therefore is applica­ble to them. It is consonant with reason and principle that when a particular system of law is made applicable to a set of persons, the whole of that system should be applied and not portion of it, unless any customs, valid and binding is proved to the contrary or else the application of the system is modified either by statutes or by anything con­tained in the rules of that system. It is not necessary that in order to have heritable blood inheritance should be traced through the father, it logically follows that the sons of a danc­ing woman or a prostitute have heritable blood between them. Hence there is heritable blood between the lines of their legitimate descendants". </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the present case as noticed before, the Government could not claim the property by escheat since the onus had not been discharged that Gouri Dasi died intestate without leaving any heir. Chanakaya laid down in Arthasastra that the estate of woman of the class taken by the King of escheat in the absence of heirs should be given away by him in Charity; but the estate should not reach the hands of the King till there was a complete failure of heirs.<br/> <br/>8. The dictum mentioned in the case <strong><em>Tara Munnee Vs. Motee Bnoneanee,</em></strong> cited above, that the tie of relationship is severed be­tween a married and respectable daughter and her prostitute mother was questioned in <strong><em>Hiralal Singh Vs Tripura Charan Roy 0 Cal 650 FB</em></strong> where a Bench of five Judges considered the ancient scriptures. Reliance was placed on Matsaya Puran—the Court observed: <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"It is expressly stated that there may be fallen persons who cannot be forsa­ken and as a illustration, it is said that although elder relations who may have lapsed into prostitution or have other­wise fallen, should be abandoned, yet the mother should never be so treated and the reason assigned for this preferen­tial treatment is that the mother who has borne and bred the child is the grea­test of all relation." (<strong><em>40 Cal at P. 672</em></strong>). </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>9. Here is the point. The plaintiff did not disown her fallen mother. Nor is the case that the plaintiff had lived apart although her life has now turned up to claim her property. The position is rather just the reverse. The plaintiff was brought up by the mother as her daughter to the knowledge of the whole world and no one else has come forward  to contest the plaintiff's claim save and except a feeble attempt by the respondent for bringing the operation of section 92 of the Act. Further that the plaintiff was born in the womb of Gouri Dasi could only be denied by Gouri Dasi herself. This is not the case. Gouri Dasi treated Gita Rani as her daughter during her life time and now it is too late for anybody else to challenge this fact. The plain­tiff succeeded in proving her case that she was the daughter of Gouri Dasi and even the con­cession that was made in this regard was noticed by the High Court Division. As such, the plaintiff's case that she was daughter of Gouri Dasi is well established and if it is so, as it is, provision of section 92(a) have no manner of application and therefore the Go­vernment cannot claim this property in pur­suance of such provision.<br/> <br/>10. In the result this appeal is allowed and the judgment and order of the Courts below are all set aside and the plaintiff's suit is decreed. There will be no order as to costs.<br/> <br/><u><strong>Shahabuddin Ahmed J.</strong></u><br/> <br/>I have gone through the judgment proposed to be delivered by my learned brother <strong>B. H. Chowdhury J.</strong> While I agree with the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed. I would give my reasons separately. The question in this appeal is whether the plaintiff is the daughter of Gouri Dasi, a prostitute, who now being dead is not available for giving testimony on this point. The appeal arises from the High Court Division's order in Civil Revision No. 1324 of 1979 upholding the concurrent deci­sion of the trial Court and the lower Appel­late Court which answered this question in the negative observing that the plaintiff-appel­lant failed to prove that she was the daughter of Gouri Dasi.<br/> <br/>12. The appellant filed the suit—O.C. Suit No. 50 of 1977 seeking declaration of her title in the suit land on the basis of her inheritance from her mother Gouri Dasi who was the admitted owner in possession of the suit-land and on whose death she has been possessing the pro­perty consisting of 10 decimals of land along with two dwelling huts thereon. The Addi­tional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Rangpur, on a report submitted by the Field Kanungo, took the view that Gouri Dasi had died intestate and issued a notice under sec­tion 92 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act to recover possession of the property which, in the circumstances, escheated to the State. But the appellant raised objection and thereafter filed this suit, allegedly on the Additional Deputy Commissioner's advice, to establish her title to the suit-land. The appellant examined three witnesses including herself to prove that she was Gouri Dasi's daughter; on the other hand, Defendant-Government examined one witness namely, the Field Kanungo, who challenged the appel­lant's claim. The trial Court held that the plaintiff failed to prove that she was Gouri Dasi's daughter, and   the lower appellate Court held that the evidence adduced by the plaintiff being scanty her claim to title could not be established thereupon. The learned Single Judge of the High Court Division did not find anything to interfere with the findings of fact.<br/> <br/>13. Mr. Roushan Ali, learned Advocate for the appellant, contends that the finding of the lower appellate Court and the trial Court has been vitiated by an erroneous view of law relating to the presumption of legitimacy as referred to in section 112 of the Evidence Act. The learned Advocate has pointed out that both the trial Court and the lower appel­late Court raised the question of pater­nity of the appellant and entered into the question as to who was appellant's father, whether there was any valid marriage between her alleged mother Gouri Dasi and one Khalipada whom she claimed to be her father and whether she was born of that wed­lock during the subsistence of this marriage. The question of paternity which is the subject matter of section 112 of the Evidence Act is totally irrelevant in this case, the learned Ad­vocate further contends. The learned Advo­cate also contends that when the defendant-Government has proceeded to take over pos­session of the suit land asserting that Gouri Dasi died intestate onus of proof lies upon the Government.<br/> <br/>14. This question has arisen in a suit filed by the appellant for a declaration that she is the owner of the land as Gouri Dasi's, daugh­ter and heir. As such, the burden of proof lies upon her alone. Government has of course disputed her claim saying that Gouri Dasi died intestate, without leaving any issue. But defendant-Government is not required to prove anything in this suit, though, in their Misc. Case No. 14/75-76 under section 92 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, the onus to prove that Gouri Dasi died intestate lies upon the Government. That Misc. Case is not before us nor any order passed therein has been challenged in this suit. Plaintiff-appellant examined three witnesses and filed some documents. She deposed as P.W. 1 claiming that she was born of Gouri Dasi and has been living with her in the suit property which she has been possessing since her mother's death. P.W. 2 corroborated her on this point. She (P.W. 2) is another prostitute of the same area, Syedpur, and she categori­cally stated that the plaintiff is the daughter of Gouri Dasi, who was also a prostitute there. Her evidence has been disbelieved by the Courts below simply on the ground that she did not see the plaintiff being born of Gouri Dasi. In other words, she was not present at the time of plaintiff's birth. But this does not exclude the possibility of her personal knowledge of the fact that the plaintiff was born of, and was brought up, by Gouri Dasi in the same prostitute area. P.W. 3 has stated that he knows that plaintiff was Gouri Dasi's daughter; he being a local man is also a competent witness to say whether the plaintiff was Gouri Dasi's daughter. As against this evidence of P.W. 1, 2 and 3, only D.W. 1, Field Kanungo, has come to challenge it; but he is not a member of the locality and has no knowledge about the matte from the time of birth of the plaintiff. An as officer of the Government, he said, he enquired about the matter in the locality and submitted a re­port that Gouri Dasi died leaving no issue. The enquiry is not found to have been made with notice to the plaintiff; it is not unlikely that interested persons having an eye upon the land misinformed him. Besides the oral evi­dence, plaintiff produced a certificate from the Chairman of Syedpur Pourashava (Ext. B) in which it has been stated that the plaintiff, Geeta Rani was Gouri Dasi's daughter. But both the trial Court and the lower appellate Court dismissed this document on the ground that "who was Geeta Rani's father" was not mentioned therein. This shows why the positive evidence adduced by the plaintiff has been rejected by the courts below.<br/> <br/>15. The question is the maternity of the plaintiff and not her paternity. There is no legal presumption as to maternity. Section 112 of the Evidence Act provides for a legal presumption as to legitimate paternity by saying that if a person is born during the continuance of a valid marriage between his mother and any man or within two hundred and eighty days after its dissolution, then this fact shall be the conclusive proof that he is the legiti­mate son of that man. This section has no manner of application when the maternity of a person is questioned. The question of maternity—i.e. whether a person is the mother of another person, is purely a question of fact. Plaintiff claimed that Gouri Dasi, though a prostitute at the earlier part of her life, later on married one Kalipada Das and that she was born of that wedlock. But the trial Court and the lower appellate Court raised the questions whether this marriage is valid or whether there was any such marriage, or who the plaintiff’s father was then. These questions are absolutely irrelevant in the present case where the question is whether Gouri Dasi was plaintiff's mother. These Courts proceeded on the erroneous view of law that to prove her maternity, plaintiff is also required to prove her paternity on the basis of a valid marriage. This totally erroneous view of law is found to have prejudi­cially influenced the finding that plaintiff was not Gouri Dasi's daughter. This finding is not immune from interference in revision. The evidence adduced by the plaintiff if sufficient to prove her maternity, that is she is Gouri Dasi's daughter and heir.<br/> <br/>16. In the result, the appeal is allowed. The judgment of the High Court Division as well as of the trial Court and the lower Ap­pellate Court is set aside and the suit is decreed. No order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
