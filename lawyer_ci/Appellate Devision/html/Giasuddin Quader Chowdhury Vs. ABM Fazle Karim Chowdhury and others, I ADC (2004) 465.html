Fazle Karim Chowdhury as void because of illegal and corrupt practices adopted by him.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> The respondent No.1 contested the said Election Petition Case by filling written objection thereto and whereby denied all the material allegations made in the said Election Petition contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the appellant (Election Petitioner) did not deposit the security cost of the Election Petition in accordance with the Rules of the High Court Division and also failed to comply with the provision of Article 49(4) of the Representation of the People's Order (President's Order No. 155 of 1972).<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> During the Progress of the case, the High Court Division framed several issues and one those was an issue of maintainability, which reads as follows: "Is the Election Petition maintainable under Article 58 of the Representation of the People's Order (P.O. No. 155 of 1972)."<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> None of the respondents filed any application for hearing of the said issue No. 1 before hearing the other issues but the High Court Division <em>suo moto</em> fixed the matter for hearing of the said issue of Maintainability.

Accordingly, Mr. Md. Zafarullah Chowdhury, Advocate of the appellant filed the Election Petition after depositing the requisite amount under Clause 4 of the Article 49 of the said Order, 1972.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong> In such view of the matter, learned Counsel contended that the High Court Division misinterpreted and misconstrued the provisions of Clause 4 of Article 49 of the Representation of the People's Order, 1972 (as amended) in as much as the term "petitioner" appearing in the said clause does not mean the "petitioner himself. His contention is that it is imperative and obligatory on the part of the Election-petitioner to deposit the amount of Tk. 2,000/- (taka two thousand) as security for cost of Election Petition as such deposit is a must and it is mandatory because of the fact that without such deposit the Election Petition can not be entertained and the same shall be dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong> In elaborating the above contention Mr. Rafiqul Huq, pointed out that form a reading of the Clause 4 of Article 49 of the Order, the intention of the legislature can not be inferred that the term 'petitioner' means that it is the appellant-petitioner alone shall have to deposit the said amount while presenting the Election Petition and not by any person on his behalf. His argument is that it is not the intention the legislature and it can not be. Rather it will be an absurd proposition that the deposit so made by the engaged lawyer of the appellant will render the Election Petition invalid being not in accordance with aforesaid provision of law. It is emphatically argued that the deposit made by any authorized person of the appellant should be deemed to have been made by the petitioner himself and it should be regarded as directory in nature. We find sufficient force in the above submissions of the learned Counsel.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong> Mr. Huq further submitted that in the absence of any specific rule, the Hon'ble Chief Justice of Bangladesh as the rule making authority is competent enough to issue such Notification in order to meet any exigencies if and when it is deemed necessary and thus it is argued that the aforesaid Notification dated 18-10-2001 having been issued with the approval of the Hon'ble Chief Justice of Bangladesh under the signature of the Registrar of the Supreme Court directing the manner of such deposit was valid and legal and payment so made as per said Notification was also valid and legal being in accordance with the aforesaid Article 49 of the Order, 1972.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong> Having reiterated his submissions made before the High Court Division, Mr. Rafiqul Huq next contended that there are 2(two) High Court Rules one is the Rules of High Court of Judicature of East Pakistan Vol.1, wherein Chapter-XVI deals with the deposit and payment of money and as a guide line for depositing money in appeal cases but there is no provision of deposit of security money for election dispute being a case of original jurisdiction and the another Rules is the Calcutta High Court Rules, 1914 wherein Chapter-XXIV provided for "Money Rules" which is for guidance and for depositing money in respect of original side suits of all nature. By an analogy being drawn Mr. Huq submits that since the High Court Division is trying the election case under Special Statutory Jurisdiction is an original court and as such the original side Rules of Calcutta High Court, 1914 may be made applicable in the matter of depositing the amount security for the cost of Election Petition. Drawing our attention to the aforesaid High Court Rules,1914, the provision of Article 49(4) of the said Order and also the implication of aforesaid notification, Mr. Huq argued that regarding the deposit of the cost of the security of Election Petition, it is mere a subject of technical nature and not a matter of substantive nature and that even if any irregularity, if found in the manner of said deposit of the cost, the Election Petition can not e thrown out of the court without hearing the petition on merit since the allegations made in the Election Petition are required to be established by adducing evidence and without giving the appellant a chance, he has been non-suited on mere technical ground as to mode of deposit in question and thereby the appellant has been seriously prejudiced. The learned Single Judge without at all considering this aspect of the case committed an error of law which resulted in an error in the decision causing failure of justice.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong> Mr. Mahbubey Alam, the learned Counsel, appearing for the respondent No. 1, on the other hand, contended that under the provision of Clause 4 of Article 49 of the Representation of the People's Order, 1972 the security deposit for the costs of the election, shall be made by the petitioner himself in person, since such deposit has been made by the appellant's Advocate is not a deposit in eye of law according the said provision. His contention is that the said People's Order, 1972 (P.O.155 of 1972) is a special law and the provisions thereof are mandatory in nature and those are to be construed and interpreted very strictly and those provisions can not be said to be directory. According to Mr. Mahbubey Alam, the so called deposit made by the lawyer of the appellant is not a deposit in the eye of law; as such the High Court Division has rightly dismissed the Election Petition as being not maintainable.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong> Mr. Alam next contended that no Rule has yet been reamed by the Supreme Court either according to Article 107 of the Constitution or according to Part X of the Code of Civil Procedure in regulating the practice and procedure of election dispute by the High Court Division and in the absence of any specific Rule, the High Court's Rules of appellate side which is being followed by the High Court Division in disposing of the Civil Appeal and Civil Petition cases. He argued that the instant case is a petition case and not a case of original side under the Calcutta High Court Rules, 1914 which is the guiding principle of the Constitutional and Company matter and the said Calcutta rule can not be applied in the instant case.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong> We have heard the learned Counsel and perused the impugned judgment and the relevant provisions of law as quoted above and we find that the provision of Article 107 is not a relevant in the instant case because the provision of Article 107 of the Constitution is with regard to framing of Rules or regulating the practice and procedure of each division that is the High Court Division and the Appellate Division and for the subordinate judiciary and it deals with Constitution of the Bench and the power exercised by the learned Judges.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong> The moot points in this case are firstly to see as to whether the Election Petition presented by the appellant is maintainable or not, secondly whether there has been non compliance of provision of Clause 4 of Article 49 of the Representation of People's Order, 1972 and lastly whether the Notification dated 18-10-2001 issued by the Registrar of the Supreme Court is in consonance with the Rules of the High Court Division of Judicature of East Pakistan Vol.1 and Calcutta High Court Division Rules, 1914. In order to consider those questions, it is to be mentioned here that the language of Article 49 of the Representation of the People's Order, 1972 is more or less similar to the provisions of Section 117 of the People's of Representation Act, 1951 of India which reads as follows:<br/> <br/>Section 117<strong>.</strong> "Deposit of security; the petitioner shall enclosed with the petition a Government Treasury Receipt showing that a deposit of Rs. 1000/- has been made by him either in a Government Treasury or in the Reserve Bank of India in favour of the Secretary to the Election Case as security for the cost of the petition".<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong> The question of deposit and not compliance for the above section was considered in the case <em>Kamaraja Nadar, Appellant Vs. Kunju Thevar and others, Respondents </em>reported in<em> AIR 1958 (SC) page 687</em> wherein their Lordships of the Supreme Court considered the question of deposit under section 117 the said Act and held in the following language-<br/> <br/>"The words 'in favour of the Secretary to the Election Commission' used in section 117 are directory and not mandatory in their character. What is of the essence of the provision contained in Section 117 is that the petitioner should furnish security for the costs of the petition, and should enclose along with the petition a Government Treasury receipt showing that a deposit of one thousand rupees has been made by him either in a Government Treasury or in the Reserve Bank of India, is at the disposal of the Election Commission to be utilized by it in the manner authorized by law and is under its control and payable on a proper application being made in that behalf to the Election Commission or to any person duly authorized by it to receive the same, be he the Secretary to the Election Commission or any one else. If, therefore it can be shown by evidence led before the Election Tribunal that the Government Treasury receipt or the challan which was obtained by the petitioner and enclosed by him along with his petition presented to the Election Commission was such that the Election Commission could on a necessary application in that behalf be in a position to realize the said sum of rupees one thousand for payment of the cost to the successful party it would be sufficient compliance with the requirements of Section 117 Similar question as to deposit of security in Election Petition also came up for consideration in the case of <em>M. Karunanidhi, Appellant Vs. H. V. Handa and others, Respondents </em>and <em>R. Rangasami, Petitioner Vs.  V. C. R. Rajappa and another, Respondents</em> and <em>A. Chinnadurai, Petitioner V. Perumal Nainar and others, Respondents</em> and <em>R. Periasamy, Appellant Vs. T. P. K. Jayaraj and others, Respondents</em> and <em>A. Chindraseknaran, Appellant Vs. P. S. Manian and others, Respondents, </em>reported in <em>A.I.R. 1983 page 558</em>. Wherein their Lordships having considered various decisions held as follows:<br/> <br/>"In the support of this appeal, learned Counsel for the appellant contends that the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 117 of the Act are mandatory, non compliance of which will entail dismissal of the election petition <em>in limine</em> under sub-section (1) of section 86 of the Act. It is urged that no distinction can be drawn between the requirements as to the making of a security deposit in the High Court under sub-section (1) of Section 117 and the manner of making such deposit and sub-section (1) of section 117 can not be dissented into two parts, one art being treated as mandatory and the other as directory. It is further urged that the words "in accordance with the rules of the high Court under sub-section (1) of section 117" were as much a mandatory requirement as the requirement that the election petitioner shall, at the time of presenting an election petition, deposit in the High Court a sum of Rs. 2000/- as security for the cost of the petition. There is therefore no warrant for the view taken by the High Court that the factum of deposit of the security amount of Rs. 2000/- in the High Court was mandatory and not the manner in which the security deposit was made. It is also urged that Rule 8 of the Election Petitions Rules framed by the High Court under Article 225 to regulate the mode of making deposit must be read as forming part of sub-section (1) of section 117 by incorporation and therefore the only manner prescribed in by making deposit in cash with the Registrar. When a statute requires that something shall be done in a Particular manner of form expressly declaring what shall be the consequence of non-compliance with it, the requirement must be regarded as imperative. Having regard to the definite stand taken by the respondent that he had complied with the requirements of Rule 8, it is not permissible to fallback on the provisions contained in Order 31 of the Madras High Court Rules relating to deposit of suitors' money. The last submission is that in view of the finding reached by the High Court that there was no strict or literal compliance of Rule 8, the election petition must be dismissed. Even if the rule of substantial compliance applies, it is clear on evidence that there has been no compliance at all much less any substantial compliance. There is intrinsic evidence to show that there has been tampering with the documents. We are afraid, the contention that there was no compliance of sub-section (1) of section 117 of the Act cannot prevail in the light of the well settled principles.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong> The submissions advanced by learned counsel for the appellant cannot be accepted as they proceed on the assumption that no distinction can be drawn between the requirement as to the making of a deposit in the High Court under sub-section (1) of section 117 and the manner of making such deposit. There was considerable emphasis laid by learned Counsel that sub-section (1) of Section 117 cannot be dissected into two parts, one part being treated as mandatory and the other as directory. The contention is wholly misconceived and indeed runs counter to several decisions of this court. It is always important to bear the distinction between the mandatory and directory provisions of a statute. Sub-section (1) of Section 117 is in two parts. The first part of sub-section (1) of 117 provides that at the time of presenting an election petition, the petitioner shall deposit in the High Court a sum of Rs. 2000/- as security for the costs of the petition, and the second is that such deposit shall be made in the High Court in accordance with the rules of the High Court. The requirement regarding the making of a security deposit of Rs. 2000/- in the High Court is mandatory, the non-compliance of which must entail dismissal <em>in limine</em> of the election petition under sub-section (1) of section 86 of the Act. But the requirement of its deposit in the High Court in accordance with the rules of the High Court is clearly directory. As Maxwell on the Interoperation of Statues, 12<sup>th</sup> Edn. at page 314 puts it: "An absolute enactment must be obeyed or fulfilled exactly, but it is sufficient if a directory enactment be obeyed or fulfilled substantially". The rule of construction is well settled and we need. Not burden the judgment with many citations.<br/> <br/>"It is well established that an enactment in form mandatory might in substance be directory and that the use of the word "shall" does not conclude the mater. The general rule of interpretation is well known and it is but and aid for ascertaining the true intention of the Legislature which is the determining factor, and that must ultimately depend on the context.<br/> <br/>The following passage from Crawford on 'Statutory Construction" at page 516 brings out the rule: <br/> <br/>"The question as to whether a statute is mandatory or directory depends upon the intent of the legislature and not upon the language in which the intent is clothed. The meaning and intention of the legislature must govern, and these are to be ascertained, not only from the phraseology of the provision, but also by considering its nature, its design, and the consequences which would follow from construing it the one way or the other." <br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong> The learned Single Judge has at all not considered the above cited decisions while disposing of the Election Petition on the ground of maintainability and as such we find that findings and decisions arrived at by the High Court Division suffers from legal infirmity and those can not be sustained in law and the learned Single Judge committed an error of law in not holding that the meaning and concept of the word 'petitioner' shall deposit does not mean that the petitioner shall, in person, have to deposit and not by any one on his behalf and if so the Election Petition shall not be registered; that there being no such consequential term that is to say the defaulting clause to the effect that unless the deposit is made by the appellant himself in person, the Election Petition will not be entertained and it shall be dismissed <em>in limini. </em>So, the argument of Mr. Rafiqul Huq being that the deposit as made on behalf of the appellant through his learned Advocate, Zarullah Chowdhury is quite valid terms of the provisions of Article 49(4) of the Order, 1972 is of substance and further we hold that the term 'petitioner' as quoted in Article 49(4) of the Order, 1972 as (amended) does not man the petitioner himself and may be some body on his behalf and this part of the said order in our view is directory.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong> We have already noticed that there are 2 (two) Rules one is Calcutta High Court Rules 1914 and the Rules of Judicature of East Pakistan vol. 1. Since there is no provision for the deposit of security for the cost of Election Petition, the Hon’ble Chief Justice of Bangladesh having the rule making power issued the Notification dated 18-10-2001 considering the matter of public importance and providing guide line in order to implement the provision of Article 49(4) of the said Order, 1972. Since the High Court Division is trying the election dispute as a court of first instance is a original court deciding the election Petition as original side matter and in such view of the matter, the analogy drawn by Mr. Rafiqul Huq that the original side Rules of Calcutta High Court 1914 may be made applicable treating the said Notification as part of the High Court Rules. We accept this argument of Mr. Rafiqul Huq.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong> It is true that the Representation of People's Order, 1972 is a special law for deciding the election dispute Chapter 5 of the Representation of the said order deals with election dispute but in view of the decisions as cited above, we are of the view that as regard presenting the Election Petition with deposit of Tk. 2000/- is a must and it is mandatory but the mode of depositing the said cost by the petitioner alone is not mandatory rather it is directory.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong> It appears that the learned single Judge himself found that the allegations as to corrupt and illegal practice have been specifically stated by the appellant in the Election Petition but without considering the fact that the appellant should be given a chance to prove the allegations by adducing evidence at the time of hearing of the case. The learned Single Judge having not considered this aspect misdirected himself in misreading the provision of Article 51 of the said Order.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong> On perusal of the impugned judgment, we find that the learned Single Judge, he has referred certain decisions wherein the proposition of law laid down is not and can not be disputed. But those decisions, in our view, have no manner of application in the instant case in view of our above discussions arising out the facts and circumstances of the instant case.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong> For all the above reasons, we find substance in this appeal and accordingly the findings and decisions of the learned Single Judge are set aside. In the result, the appeal is allowed any order as to cost.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></span></div></div></div>
