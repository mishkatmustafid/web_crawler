(7)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Lawyers Involved: </strong><br/>Md. Nawab Ali, Advocate-on-Record-For the Petitioners.<br/>Not represented–the Respondents.<br/> <br/><strong>Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1149 of 2005.</strong><br/>(From the Judgment and Order dated March 30, 2005 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 4357 of 2004).<br/> <br/><strong>JUDGMENT</strong><br/> <br/><strong><u>Md. Ruhul Amin J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment dated March 30, 2005 of a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 4357 of 2004 discharging the Rule obtained against the judgment and order dated August 7, 2004 of the 3rd Court of Additional District Judge, Sylhet in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 7 of 2004 affirming the order dated January 1, 2004 of the 2nd Court of Joint District Judge, Sylhet in Title Suit No. 237 of 2003. The trial Court by the aforesaid order allowed the prayer for temporary injunction made by the plaintiffs and by the self same order rejected the prayer for temporary injunction made by the defendant Nos. 1-6. The trial Court by its order of temporary injunc­tion restrained the defendants from dispossessing the plaintiff from the land in suit till disposal of the suit.<br/> <br/>2. The defendants filed a petition seek­ing injunction against the plaintiffs for restraining them from changing the nature and character of the land in suit by dispossessing the defendants and also for restraining the plaintiffs from transferring the land in suit elsewhere.<br/> <br/>3. The suit was filed seeking declara­tion that the kabala bearing No. 5994 of the year 1969 executed by Md. Aslam in favour of the defendants is illegal, fraudulent and not binding, upon the plaintiffs. It is the case of the plaintiffs that the land in suit belonged to Munshi Abdul Halim and he gifted the same to Abdul Mazid who transferred the same to his wife Sayeda Banu in lieu of dower and delivered possession to her, that Sayeda Banu died leaving behind only son Abdur Rouf and the plaintiffs inherited the land left by Abdur Rouf and they are possessing the same, that the defen­dants are claiming the land on the basis of fictitious kabala dated March 31, 1969.<br/> <br/>4. Plaintiffs after filing the suit filed an application seeking an order of injunc­tion    against the defendants for restraining them from dispossessing the plaintiffs. In support of the prayer of temporary injunction it was stated by the plaintiffs that the defendants are trying to dispossess them the land in suit on the basis of a fictitious kabala.<br/> <br/>5. The defendant Nos. 1-6 resisted the prayer for temporary injunction by filing written objection stating, inter alia, that Sayeda Banu transferred the land in suit to one Haji Md. Aslam by the registered deed dated January 30, 1961, that Haji Md. Aslam purchased the other property from Sayeda Banu by the kabala dated  November 11, 1963 and possessed the same by establishing a manufacturing   workshop, that Haji Md. Aslam sold the suit land to the predecessor of the defendants by the kabala dated March 31, 1969 and delivered possession, that predecessor of the defendants acquired the manufacturing workshop “Aslam Engineering Workshop Pvt. Ltd. Company” in 1981 and sold 6 decimals of land to the Company by the kabala dated January 5, 1982, that the plaintiffs forcibly  dispossessed the defendants from the land in suit on June 9, 2003 and had taken away the machinery worth Tk. 20,00,000/- from the workshop, that the plaintiffs have no title in the land in suit and as such they are not entitled to the injunction prayed for.<br/> <br/>6. As stated hereinbefore the trial court upon hearing the parties allowed the plaintiffs' prayer for temporary injunction and thereby restrained the defendants from dispossessing the plaintiffs from the land in suit. It may be mentioned the defendants did not proceed against the order rejecting their prayer for injunction.                                     <br/> <br/>7. The defendants went on appeal but without any success and thereupon defendants moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained Rule. The High Court Division discharged the Rule on the finding that defendants admitted that they were dispossessed from the land in suit and thus the plaintiffs are in possession of the land in suit on the date of filing of the suit. In the background of the said fact trial Court as well as the appellate Court held that plaintiffs “have proved their prima facie title and also their possession in the suit land”. In the state of the admitted possession of the plaintiffs prayer for temporary injunction was allowed by the trial Court and was affirmed by the appellate Court. The High Court Division rejected the contention of the petitioners before the High Court Division that the appellate Court while dismissing the appeal did not consider the defendants' case of temporary injunction for restraining the plaintiffs from changing the nature and character of the land in suit and from making transfer of the land in suit, since the defendant petitioners did not prefer any appeal as against the order of the trial Court rejecting their prayer for temporary injunction. It may be mentioned that the defendants filed the appeal only as against the order of the trial Court granting injunction upon allowing the prayer of the plaintiffs and thereby restraining the defendants from dispossessing the plaintiffs. The High Court Division discharged the Rule on the finding that the plaintiffs in support of their prayer for temporary injunction proved their prima facie title in the land in suit and also their possession in the land in suit and that the plaintiffs being in possession of the land in suit the balance of con­venience and inconvenience also is in favour of the plaintiffs and against the defendants.<br/> <br/>We have heard the learned Advocate-on-record and perused the materials in the paper book. The learned Advocate-on-record failed to point out any error of the kind in the judgment of the High Court Division calling for interference.<br/> <br/>Accordingly the petition is dis­missed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
