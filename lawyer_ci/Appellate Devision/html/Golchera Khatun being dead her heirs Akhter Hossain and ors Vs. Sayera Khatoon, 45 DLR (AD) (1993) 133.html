Nawab Ali, Advocate-on-Record-For the Appellant. (In all the appeals).</em><br/><em>Abdul Basel Mujumder, Advocate-on-Record­- For the Respondent. (In all the appeals).</em><br/><br/><strong>Civil Appeal Nos. 7 to 10 of W91.</strong><br/>(From the Judgment and order dated 29th January, 1986 passed by the High Court Division, Chittagong Bench in Civil Revision Nos. 1420 to 1423 of 1997).<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Judgment</strong></span></div><strong><u>MH Rahman J.</u></strong><br/><br/>The appellants filed four different applications for pre‑emption, Miscellancous Case Nos. 14, 15, 18 and 19 of 1973 in the Court of Munsif, Fifth Court, Sadar, Chittagong, on the ground that the vendors without any notice to them sold the case land to the respondent pre-emptee, a stranger to the holding in question.<br/><br/>2. The trial Court dismissed the petitions after holding that the pre-emptors were not co‑sharers by inheritance. The appellate Court found both pre­-emptors and the pre-emptees as co-sharers by purchase and held that they had equal claim for pre­-emption and allowed the pre-emptors' claim to the extent of 50% of the case land. The appellate Court appeared to have done an evenhanded justice. The High Court Division approved that measure.<br/><br/>3. Section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act is a beneficial legislation, intended for the convenience of the co-sharers of a holding of land, for prevention of fragmentation of such a holding, and also for the convenience of the tenants holding land contiguous to the land transferred. But it is also a clog on transfer of property. Any provision of law barring a claim of pre‑emption must be strictly construed.<br/><br/>4. Sub-section (4) of section 96 provides “when an application for pre‑emption has been made, under sub-section (1) of section 96 any of the remaining co-sharer tenants including the transferee, if one of them, and the tenants holding land contiguous to the land transferred may, within the period referred to in sub‑section (1) or within two months of the date of the service of the notice of the application under clause (b) of sub‑section (3), whichever be earlier, apply to join in the said application" [.] This is an enabling provision. The latter part of that sub‑section contains a barring provision: "any co-sharer tenant or tenant holding land contiguous to the land transferred, who has not applied either under sub-section (1) or under this sub‑section, shall not have any further right to purchase under this section."<br/><br/>5. In this case the pre‑emptee tried to resist the claim of the pre‑emptors and did not join in the application for pre‑emption as a transferee-co-sharer and did not take any step required under sub-section (4) of section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act to join in the appellants' application for pre-emption. She cannot be granted the half of the case land in the name of even-handed justice, on the ground that both the pre-emptors and the pre-emptee were found, being co‑sharers by purchase, to be on equal footing.<br/><br/>We allow all the four appeals. The entire interest in the transferred plot will vest in the appellants. No costs.<br/><br/>Ed.                      </div></div>
