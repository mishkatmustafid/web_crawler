(6)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Lawyers Involved: </strong><br/>SS Halder, Senior Advocate, instructed by Md. Aftab Hossain, Advocate-on-Record—For the Petitioners<br/>Not represented—The Respondents<br/> <br/><strong>Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.132 of 2001. </strong><br/>(From the Judgment and order dated 14-8-200 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.4302 of 1999).<br/> <br/><strong>JUDGMENT</strong><br/> <br/><strong><u>Md. Ruhul Amin J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>Delay of 17 days is condoned.<br/> <br/>This petition for leave to appeal is by the plaintiff-petitioners against the judgment and order dated August 14, 2000 of the High Court Division in Civil Revision 4302 of 1999 making the Rule absolute and consequent thereupon set aside the judgment and decree dated April 22,1999 of the 2nd Court of Additional District Judge, Khulna in Title Appeal No.19 of 1992 dismissing the same and thereby affirmed the judgment and decree dated November 30,1991 of the 1st Court of Subordinate Judge, Khulna in Title Suit No.207 of 1979 decreeing the same. The suit was for declaration of title as well as for a decree of permanent injunction restraining the defendants from disturbing the possession of the plaintiffs in the land in suit.<br/> <br/>2. The plaintiffs filed the suit stating, inter alia, that the land in suit belonged to Chandan Mal Soni who died leaving two sons, Sree Krishna Soni and Hari Krishna Soni. Sree Krishna filed Title Suit 13 of 1959 impleading Hari Krishna Soni and the suit was decreed on compromise declaring the title of Sree Krishna Soni. Further case of the plaintiffs is that while in possession they came to know on 20 July, 1980 that defendant No. 2 has included the property within the periphery of Khulna Hat and Bazar without any service of notice and that defendant No. 3 served a notice on the plaintiffs to vacate the land in suit and then plaintiffs filed Writ Petition No. 394 of 1970 and the same was dismissed for non-prosecution along with other similar writ petitions.<br/> <br/>3.The suit was contested by the defend­ants averring that the suit is not maintainable and that the land in suit has been recorded in the kash Khatian being within the periphery of the Khulna Hat and Bazar and that the land in suit as per provision of section 20(2a) of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 is of the class of non-retainable land and that com­pensation roll in the name of Sree Krishna Soni has already been prepared and the same has been published in the Gazette and that notices were served on Sree Krishna Soni and others.<br/> <br/>4. The trial Court, in the light of the material on record, decreed the suit. The defendants took appeal to the court of District Judge, Khulna and the same was heard by the learned Additional District Judge who upon dismissing the appeal affirmed the judgment and decree of the court of first instance. There­upon, the defendant-Government of Bangla­desh moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained the Rule. The High Court Division made the Rule absolute on the findings:<br/> <br/>"The Government acquired the land 0.03 acre in CS Khatian No. 295 plot No: 2547 corresponding to SA Khatian No. 367 SA Plot No.3173 and 0.04 acre in CS Khatian No. 367 Plot No. 2513 correspond­ing to SA Plot No. 3134 and compensation roll was prepared on 1-9-1962 but the courts below found a rent receipt dated 1-12-1960 which is prior to the compensation assessment roll. The finding that the land is retainable and it is not within the periphery of the Hat and Bazar is contrary to law." ...."Since the property has been acquired by the Government it cannot be the tenanted property of the petitioner. The defendant specifically mentioned in para 8 of their written statement that Sree Krishna Soni died in the year 1963 and it is not denied by the plaintiffs and it is admitted in the Writ Petition No. 394 of 1970. The defendant also made a sketch map of the periphery of the Hat and Bazar. But it was not considered by the appellate Court. It clearly shows that the property is within the periphery of Hat and Bazar of Khulna."<br/> <br/>5.Mr SS Haider, learned Counsel for the petitioners, submits that High Court Division was in error in reversing the findings of fact arrived at by the Courts below to the effect that the land in suit is the private land and that not non-retainable   land and that also not within the periphery of the Khulna Hat and Bazar and that the High Court Division was in error in setting aside the concurrent finding of fact that the land in suit is tenanted land and the said is retainable class of land and that preparation of compensation assessment roll not correct and that compensation roll so prepared is illegal.<br/> <br/>6.  It is seen from the judgment of the High Court Division that the land in suit being the land within periphery of Khulna Hat and Bazar compensation roll has been   prepared and finally published in the gazette and that being the undisputed fact relief sought in the suit was not available to the plaintiffs so long compensation roll is not revised and the land is being shown as retainable class of land. It is also seen from the Judgment of the High Court Division that compensation roll in respect of the land in suit was prepared as back as in 1962 upon assessing considerable amount of money and thereupon compensation roll has been published in the gazette. It is further seen from the judgment of the High Court Division that a sketch map has been prepared some time in 1975 by the Government in respect of the land in suit and the same has been shown within the periphery of the Khulna Hat and Bazar.  The High Court Division, on consideration of the materials on record, particularly the fact of pre­paration of compensation assessment roll and publication thereof in the gazette as well as the sketch map prepared in 1975 showing the land in suit within the periphery of Khulna Hat and Bazar set aside the judgment and decree of the courts below. The learned Counsel has submitted that compensation assessment roll in respect of the land of the plaintiffs and pub­lication thereof was illegal and that publication of the said illegal assessment roll can no way take away the title of the plaintiffs in the land which is of retainable class of land and that also not within the periphery of Khulna Hat and Bazar. He has also submitted that the sketch map said to have been prepared in 1975 showing land within periphery of Khulna Hat and Bazar is an unauthorised and illegal act of the respondents and, on the basis thereof, plaintiffs cannot be deprived of their tenanted land which they are legally entitled to retain. The submission of the learned Counsel is of no merit since preparation of the compensation assessment roll and the publication thereof has the legal presumption that the land claimed by the plaintiffs is of non-retainable class of land and that as on the publication of the compen­sation assessment roll in the gazette, the land has vested in the Government the plaintiffs are not entitled to raise any claim in the land and, as such, relief sought in the suit was not available to them. Moreover, as back as in 1975 the Government prepared the sketch map showing the land in suit within the periphery of Khulna Hat and Bazar and that as it appears the said sketch map has been prepared in the background of the publication of the compen­sation assessment roll in the gazette the same carries legal weight in arriving at the decision as to the class of land in suit. As in the back­ground of the materials on record the High Court Division has arrived at the finding that Courts below were in error in decreeing the suit, in our view, the finding so arrived at by the High Court Division is quite in accordance with law and suffers from no infirmity and illegality.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
