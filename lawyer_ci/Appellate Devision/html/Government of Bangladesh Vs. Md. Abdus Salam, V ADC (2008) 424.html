Tafazzul Islam J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>Delay of 29 days is condoned.<br/> <br/>2. This petition for leave to appeal, at the instance of the defendants,  is directed against the judgment dated 13.7.2002 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Order No.7226 of 2002 summarily reject­ing the revisional application.<br/> <br/>3. The respondent Nos.1-13, as plaintiffs, filed Title Suit No. 27 of 1995 in the Court of Assistant Judge, Satkhira for declara­tion of title to the suit land impleading the petitioners as well as the respondent Nos.14-20 as defendants stating that they are in possession of the suit land and in the above suit they also filed an application under Order 39 Rule 1 read with section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code praying for an order of temporary injunction restraining the defendants from creating disturbance with their peaceful possession in the suit land or evicting the plaintiffs therefrom. The defendant-petitioners opposed the above prayer for temporary injunction by filing a written objection denying plaintiffs possession in the suit land and claiming that the suit land is gov­ernment khas land and the same is known as Udar Box Khal and that there is no res­idential house in suit land and that the suit land is under the control of the Ministry of Land and the government has every right to lease out the same as Jalmahal. The learned Assistant Judge by his judgment and order dated 13.10.97 rejected the application for temporary injunction. On appeal, the learned Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Satkhira, by judgment and order dated 24.6.2001 allowed the application for temporary injunction directing the parties to maintain status quo in respect of the leasing out of the suit land. The petitioner, being aggrieved preferred a revisional application before the High Court Division which was summarily dismissed on the findings that the said order of status-quo is operating since 24.6.2001, that is, more than one year and there is no new circumstances so as to disturb the said order of status-quo and moreover, there is no sufficient expla­nation for the delay in filing the revision application so as to condone the delay. The High Court Division, in the above facts and circumstances, did not exercise its discretion for condoning the delay.<br/> <br/>4. As it appears the High Court Division, on assigning reason, did not condone the delay. Accordingly we find no cogent rea­son to interfere with the judgment passed by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
