The writ petitioner challenged the judg­ment and order of the Court of Settlement passed in Case No. 113 of 1992 under sec­tion 7 of Ordinance No. 54 of 1985 on the ground that the same has been passed without lawful authority.<br/> <br/>3. The case of the writ Petitioner, in short, is that the disputed premises namely F/G/7, Sher Shah Colony (Housing Estate) Chittagong was allotted to one Nazir Mohammad by registered deed of lease dated 04.06.1960. Nazir Mohammad while in possession sold the same to one Md. Safi by a registered kabala dated 17.04.1964. Md. Safi got his name mutat­ed in the record of rights. Thereafter, Md. Safi entered into a contract to sell the building and delivered possession to the writ petitioner and also executed a regis­tered kabala dated 26.12.1980 in favour of the writ petitioner who after purchase applied for mutation of her name but the Assistant commissioner, Housing and set­tlement by memo dated 301.11.1982 informed her that mutation could not be allowed as the building had already been included in the list of abandoned build­ings. Thereafter, she filed an application for release of the building and the Deputy Commissioner, Chittagong by his Memo dated   06.06.1985    recommended for release of the same to the Commissioner of Chittagong Division from the list of abandoned buildings. The further case is that Md. Shafi and she are Bangladeshi nationals by birth and hence no permis­sion for transfer of the property is required but still the building was not released and she was constrained to file the case before the Court of Settlement which after hear­ing arbitrarily dismissed the case. The petitioner then moved the High Court Division in writ jurisdiction and the High Court Division after hearing made the Rule absolute as noticed earlier.<br/> <br/>4. The Government of Bangladesh con­tested the writ petitioner without filing any affidavit-in-opposition.<br/> <br/>5. Leave was granted to consider the sub­mission that the High Court Division erred in law in setting aside the finding of facts arrived at on evidence on record by the Court of Settlement in exercise of its juris­diction under Article 102 of the Constitution like a court of appeal and the further submission that in view of the spe­cific findings of the Court of Settlement that Md. Safi had not acquired any title to the building in question and for that mat­ter the writ petitioner did not acquire any right, title and interest the High Court Division erred in law in entertaining the writ petition and setting aside the judg­ment and order of the Court of Settlement which rightly found that property was an abandoned one and the further submission that the High Court Division erred in law in finding that the Court of Settlement failed to decide the character of the prop­erty as to whether it is an abandoned prop­erty or not.<br/> <br/>6. We have heard Mr. M.A. Azim, the learned Deputy Attorney General for the appellant and Mr. Md. Mozaffar Hossain, the learned Advocate for respondent No. 1 and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/> <br/>7. It is not disputed that the premises namely F/G/7, Sher Shah Colony (Housing Estate) Chittagong was allotted to one Nazir Mohammad by registered deed of lease dated 04.06.1960. Nazir Mohammad while in possession sold the same to one Md. Shafi by a registered kabala dated 17.04.1964. It is also undis­puted that Md. Shafi got his name mutat­ed in the record of rights. The Respondents case is that Md. Shafi entered into a contract to sell the premises to the Writ Petitioner and delivered possession and also executed a registered kabala dated 26.12.1980 in favour of the writ petitioner. There is no evidence on record to show that Md. Safi was a non­-local rather it is on record that he sometimes resided in Dhaka and some times in Chittagong and notices was served upon Md. Shafi in his address in Bangladesh as found by the Court of Settlement and his possession in the suit property was also found by the Court of Settlement. It is to be remembered Md. Shafi purchased the disputed premises in the year 1964 that is long before the coursing into force of P.O. 16 of 1972.<br/> <br/>8. From Memo No. 1105 dated 06.06.1985 of the Deputy Commissioner, Chittagong, addressed to the Commissioner, Chittagong Division and Chairman, Management    Board for Abandoned Property, Chittagong, it is clear that Md. Shafi and the Writ   petitioner are Bangladeshi nationals and the Writ Petitioner has been in peaceful possession of the disputed building.<br/> <br/>9. Therefore the contention of the writ petitioner that since Md. Shafi is a nation­al of Bangladesh by birth no permission of transfer of property in her favour was required appears to have substance. Since it has been proved that Md. Shafi pur­chased the property in 1964 by a regis­tered kabala and he is a citizen of Bangladesh by birth and notices apon him were served by the Government in his address in Bangladesh and he got his name mutated in the record of right and paid rent/taxes to the Government, by no means of imagination it can be said that the disputed property is abandoned prop­erty. Therefore, the transfer by Md. Shafi to the writ petitioner did not require any permission and the same is a valid trans­fer. Hence, the disputed property did not assume the character of abandoned prop­erty.<br/> <br/>10. In our view, that the High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials on record, rightly decided that the suit property is not abandoned proper­ty.<br/> <br/>The appeal is dismissed without costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></span></div></div></div>
