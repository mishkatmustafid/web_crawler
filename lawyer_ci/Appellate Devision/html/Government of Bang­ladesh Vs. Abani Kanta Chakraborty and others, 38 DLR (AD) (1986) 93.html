Government of Bangladesh is the appell­ant. Respondent Abani Kanta Chakraborty instituted the suit for declaration of his ten­ancy right in respect of the suit land cont­ending that over one acre of C.S. Plot No. 3271 was possessed by him for the last 40 years. The suit land is contiguous to his homestead. He grew jute to the knows ledge of the original landlord. Since 1940 he acquired tenancy right to the submit land but the suit land has been recorded as khas land of the Government. In 1964 he wanted to pay rent to the Hogla Tahsil Kutchery and there for the first time he came to know that in the rent-roll the suit land has been wrongly shown as khas land of the Govern­ment, thereby casting a cloud on his tena­ncy right.<br/> <br/>3. Defendant-appellants contested the suit. Their case was that the suit land is s part of C.S. Plot No, 3271 of mouza Hogla which co­nsists of 21.61 acre of land out of which the plaintiff claimed only one acre. The ren-treceiving interest of the Zaminders were acq­uired under Chapter II and the entire C.S. Plot was acquired by the Government as the same was under the khas possession of the ex landlord. The plaintiff has no possession and the suit is liable to be dismissed the case of defendants No. 2-3 was that they took; pattan of 3 acres of land out of the suit Dag No. 327I and they are in possession on payment of Govt, rent. It is stated that the plaintiff himself also prayed for taking pattan of a portion of the land but since he was not in possession his prayer was not granted by the Government.<br/> <br/>4. The trial court came to the finding that the plaintiff was in possession of the suit land from 1940. The rent receiving interest of Maharaja Sashi Kanta Acharya Bahadur was acquired by the Government in 1951. It took the view that as such the plaintiff could not claim title in respect of the suit land on the basis of adverse possession for a period less than 12 years and accordingly dismissed the suit.<br/> <br/>5. The appellate court below on the ana­lysis of the evidence found that the plaintiff was in possession of the suit land from 1927 Ext.1 jute licence was considered and it was notice “unless the land was in posses­sion from before 1949 it can not be used for cultivation of jute by him in the year 1940.” The appellate court below took the view that jute is generally grown in high land and the licence that was given in 1940 fits in with the plaintiff's case that he was in possession of the suit plot long before 1940. It may be noted that the suit land is situated in the Padmai beel. The appellate court below considered "unless the same silted up around 1927 it cannot become fit for jute cultivation in the year 1940." Further it was noticed that "none else has claimed to have possessed the suit land in 1940 or prior to that." The suit land consists of 1.61 acres of land, out of this, the plaintiff claimed only 1 acre, which is adjacent to his house and land. Defendants 2-3 are not affected if the plaintiff's suit is decreed, because they have taken lease 3 acres each out of the same suit plot from the Government and there are plenty of land in the suit plots to accommodate them as well. The licence that was produced by the plaintiff was not challenged by the defendant and the app­ellate court took the view that the jure lice­nces are generally allowed on the basis of the undisputed ownerships and fitness of the land for the purpose of such ownerships which are required to be ascertained by the licencing authority and observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Therefore, in this case we can presume that similar enquiries were held and satisfactory results were found."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In this view of the matter, the appellate court below decreed the suit. The High Court Divi­sion, in Civil Revision, affirmed the judgment of the appellate court below.<br/>Leave was granted to consider whether the plea of adverse possession could be taken against the Government in the facts and circumstance of the case.<br/> <br/>6. Mr. Boktear Hossain, Advocate-on-Record, appearing for the Government-appel­lant, contended that the suit is not maintain­able, in as much as no such plea of adverse possession could be taken in view of P.O. No. 90 of 1972 nor a plea is available unless it is found that the plaintiff is in possession of the land for more than 60 years.<br/> <br/>7. The arguments are not convincing. Firstly, P. O. No. 90 of 1972 has no manner of application, because the plaintiff has not challenged the acquisition of any property under the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act nor the question of adverse possession arises here though in framing the suit he took the plea for his tenancy as against the ex-landlord. The plaintiff's simple case is that he was on the land since 1927 and the land was a low land. It silted up gradually and in 1940 it became fit for cultivation of jute and since it was regulated by law, he applied for licence and got Ext.1. Then he grew jute. The landlord was Maharaja Sashi Kanta Acharya Bahadur. It was very much known to tae Zaminders that he was in possession. In 1951 with the acquisition of rent receiving interest, the Zaminder has disappeared and he becomes tenant under section 3 (4) (e):<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">''all tenants holding lands in such estates, (taluks, tenures, holdings or tenancies) directly under the rent-receiver specified in the notification under sub-­section (1), shall become tenants dire­ctly under the Government and shall pay real at the existing rate, in respect of the rent paying lands so held by them, to the Government and not to anybody else."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>His case that he was a tenant of ex-rent rec­eiver and he became a tenant under the Government and his only obligation is to pay rent. Clause (g) stipulates:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"an arrear of rent payable under (clauses (e), (f) and (ff)) may, without prejudice to any other mode of recovery, be recoverable under the Bengal Public Demands Recovery Act, 1913"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The rest of the land can be settled by the Government vide section 76:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">''(1) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, any land which vests in the Government under any of the provisions of this Act shall be absolutely at the disposal of the Government; and the Government shall be competent to make settlement of such land in accor­dance with such rules as it may make in this behalf or to use or otherwise deal with such land in such manner as it thinks fit:<br/>Provided that no land shall be settled with a person unless he is a person to whom transfer of land can be made under section 90:<br/>Provided further that in making settle­ment of any cultivable land preference shall be given to an applicant for settle­ment who cultivates land by himself or by the members of his family and holds a quantity of cultivable land which, added to the quantity of cultivable land, if any, held by the other members of his family, is less than three acres.<br/>(2) No Civil Court shall entertain any application or suit concerning any matter relating to the settlement, by any officer of the Government, of any land under sub-section (1)."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>8. The plaintiff stated that he went to pay rent to the Tahsil office, but it was not accep­ted, because it was shown as khas land of the Government. Since he has become a tenant under the law, his obligation to pay rent still continues (see section 140 when the arrears of rent shall bear simple interest at the rate of six and a quarter per centum per annum from the expiry of the year in which the Tent or instalments of rent, as the case may be, fall due to the date of payment of the filing of certificate under the Bengal Public Demands Recovery Act, 1913) subject to the period of limitation as given by section 142.<br/><br/>9. His jute licence was given after the exa­mination by the authority in pursuance of sec­tion 10 of the Bengal Jute Regulation Act, 1940 and any jute grown without obtaining licence is liable to destruction (section 17). Since the plaintiff has produced his licence Ext.1 that he grew jute since 1940 and the land being low land as it was situated in the beel took years to become fit for jute cultivation. These circumstances make a fitting story of the plaintiff that he is in possession of the land. Then the acquisition of the rent receiving in­terest does not affect him at all because being a small cultivator who claimed possession in only 1 acre of land out of 21 acres of the suit plot there is no difficulty to recognise the status as a tenant which he acquired by opera­tion of law.<br/> <br/>10. In M. H. Khanddkar Vs. Bangladesh 30 DLR (SC) 1 this Court explained the meaning of 'raiyat' and "tenant" and it was pointed out that a tenant of an agricultural holding is generally called 'raiyat’. Further it was observed that the main object of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act was to eliminate all those interests intervening between the Government and the tenant in actual occupation of land to create, throughout the country, one class of tenants directly under the Government, which would be the sole receiver of rent payable by the tenants in respect of the lands comprised in their tenancy and their rights and liabilities would be regulated by uniform code of laws. In the present case the rent-receiving interests were acquired by the Government, since the Zaminder was replaced by the Government. And the tenant, the res­pondent, intended to pay rent to the Government and went to do so to the Tahsil Office; it was not accepted. But he is on the land it is only one acre out of 21 acres. He even wanted to take pattan from the Government. His tenancy right has matured over the last forty years to his status. It was only against the ex-landlord that he took the plea of ad­verse possession as abundant caution. In so far as the Government, his new landlord, is con­cerned, be was willing to pay rent and continue to do so. Payment of arrear rent is subject to law. His status however cannot be denied.<br/> <br/>11. The apprehension of the defendant-respondents is, therefore, without any subs­tance. Defendants 2-3 can be well accommoda­ted and presumably they have been accommodated because they never raised the point that they are in possession of the plaintiff's plot of land.<br/> <br/>In view of the above, there is no hesitation in saying that the judgments of the Courts below are correct and the apprehension of the appellant is unfounded.<br/> <br/>In the result, therefore, this appeal is dis­missed with the aforesaid observation. There will be no order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
