Ruhul Amin J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>Plaintiffs have filed this petition for leave to appeal against the judgment dated May 12, 2004 of a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.1835 of 1997 making absolute the Rule obtained against the judgment and decree dated March 20, 1997 of the 3rd Court of Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge) Sylhet in Title Appeal No. 6 of 1993 allowing the same and thereupon setting aside the judgment and decree dated June 29, 1992 of the Additional Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Sadar, Sylhet in Title Suit No.2 of 1992/295 of 1989 dismissing the same. The suit was filed seeking redemption of an usufructuary mortgage dated 26-12-1927.<br/> <br/>2. The suit was filed on September 27, 1989. It was the case of the plaintiffs, that land measuring 2.53 acres belonged to 4 brothers, by name Himmat Khan, Rahmat Khan, Hanif Khan and Anis Khan, that Hanif Khan and Anis Khan mortgaged the land in suit by a registered deed of mortgage dated December 26, 1927 for an amount of Taka 48 and that it was stipulated in the mortgage deed that after one year the mortgagors would be entitled to redeem the mortgage in the month of Magh on payment of the balance of the amount, that said Hanif Khan and Anis Khan mortgaged the land of the heirs of Himmat Khan and Rahmat Khan to the predecessor of the defendant Nos. 1-11, Asmot Miah, and since mortgage said Asmot Miah was in possession of the land so mortgaged and that after the death of Asmot Miah, his heirs defendant Nos. 1-11 were possessing the mortgaged land, that in the first part of Magh, 1395 BS plaintiffs requested the defendant Nos. 1-4 to return the land but the defendants refused to do so, that to frustrate the claim of the plaintiffs defendant No. 9 in collusion with the defendant No. 12 created deed of exchange on June 11, 1989 in respect of 8 decimals of land of Plot No. 4346 and the defendant Nos. 5 and 7 in collusion with defendant Nos. 13 and 14 created a deed of sale dated August 31, 1989 for 3 decimals of land from the eastern part of plot No. 4344, that defendant Nos. 2 and 3 in collusion with the defendant Nos.13 and 14 created a deed of sale on September 2, 1989 for 4 decimals of land from the western part of the plot No. 4346, that defendant Nos. 1, 8 and 11 created a deed in respect of 15 decimals of land of plot No. 4346 in favour of the defendant Nos.13-16, that the said deeds are collusive and fraudulent, that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover possession of the suit land as well as usufruct thereof.<br/> <br/>3. The suit was contested by defendant Nos. 1, 8, 10 and 11, in one group as well as by defendant Nos.13 and 14 and by the defendant No. 12 separately by filing separate sets of written statement. The contesting defendants in their written statement denied the material overments made in the plaint. The case of the 1st group of defendants was that the land in suit belonged to their predecessor and that the same has been possessed by their predecessor for more than statutory period of limitation and thus predecessor of the defendants and they have acquired title by adverse possession, that defendant No.1 upon amicable partition got the entire land of the plot No.4354 and 9 decimals of land of plot No.4344 and he sold 26 decimals of land from plot No.4354 to Ibrahim Ali in 1981 and said Ibrahim Ali re­sold the land to the defendant No.1, that defendant No. 1 sold 15 decimals of land on August 6, 1989 to defendant Nos.13 and 14 and their brothers Sirajul Islam and Safiqul Islam, that balance 3 decimals of land of the plot land of which was sold to defendant Nos.13 and 14 and their brothers, is possessed by defendant No.9, that defendant Nos. 2-7's predecessor Eklas Mia got 8 decimals of land in his share from the land of plot No.4346 and the heirs of Eklas Mia sold the said land by the kabalas dated August 31, 1989 and September 2, 1989 to defendant Nos.13 and 14, that the land has been recorded in the name of 3 brothers namely, Babur Mia, Moyna Mia and Eklas Mia, that deed of mortgage was executed on 10th Poush, 1334 BS for one year and, as such, the same expired after one year and from the date of such expiry plaintiffs' right to redemption arose but the plaintiffs have filed the suit after lapse of 62 years and, as such, the suit is barred by limitation, that defendant Sufi Mia had not exchanged any land from plot No. 4346 with Shaista Mia on June 11,1989 and that if any deed of exchange is produced the same is forged, false and fabricated, since at the relevant time Sufi Mia was not in the country and that his address shown in the exchange deed is not correct and that the plaintiff Motasir Mia in collusion with the father of Shaista Mia collusively brought into existence the suit for exchange deed, that the plaintiffs are not entitled to get khas possession and their suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/>4. The case of the defendant Nos.13 and 14 was that Asmot Mia by a registered deed dated 10th Poush 1334 BS became the absolute owner of the land in suit and was possessing the same, that Asmot Mia died leaving 3 sons by name, Babur Mia, Moyna Mia and Eklas Mia and by amicable partition heirs of Eklas Mia (defendant Nos. 2-4) got 8 decimals of land along with their sister in plot No. 4346 and 4344 and defendant Nos.4-7 sold 32 decimals of land on August 31, 1989 and defendant Nos.2 and 3 sold 42 decimals of land by the kabala dated September 2, 1989 to the   defendant Nos.13 and 14 and that defendant Nos.1, 8, 10 and 11 sold 15 decimals of land to these defendants and their brothers, Sirajul Islam and Shafiqul Islam on August 6, 1989, that by purchase these defendants and their brothers have acquired the entire land of plot Nos.4344 and 4346, that plaintiffs never made any objection to the transfer so made by the heirs of Asmot Mia, that record of right has been prepared in the name of heirs of Asmot Mia without any objection from the   plaintiffs' side, that plaintiffs have no right, title and interest in the land in suit.<br/> <br/>5. The case of the defendant No.12 was that Asmot Mia purchased some land on 15-2-1928 and owned and possessed the same till his death and after his death said property amicably partitioned amongst his heirs, that on June 11,1989 defendant No. 9 Sufi Mia son of Asmot Mia exchanged 8 decimals of land from plot No. 4346 with the land of defendant No. 12, that claim of the defendant Nos.13 and 14 that they purchased some land of plot Nos. 4344 and 4346 by kabalas dated (August 1, 1989 and September 2, 1989 is false and they have no possession in the land so claimed to have purchased.<br/> <br/>6. The trial Court on consideration of the materials on record dismissed the suit on the finding that the suit was barred by limitation and plaintiffs have failed to establish their case and the suit is not maintainable' that defendant No. 12 is not entitled to the land said to have got by exchange, that mortgage was made on 26-12-1927 for one year and, as such, on the expiry of the said one year the plaintiffs were required to file the suit prior to the expiry of 60 years on and from 26-12-1928.<br/> <br/>7. The plaintiffs went on appeal. The appellate Court upon allowing the appeal set aside the judgment and decree of the trial Court and thereupon decreed the suit in the finding that the suit is not barred by limitation since demand for return of possession was made within 60 years and, as such, the period for limitation shall be counted as per Article 143 of the Limitation Act, that plaintiffs made the demand for return of possession in the 1st part of Magh, 1395 BS since by that time the mortgage being an usufructuary mortgage, the land in question became free from mortgage, that in case of usufructuary mortgage period of limitation as per provision of Article 143 of the Limitation Act, 1908 runs from the date of refusal to return possession of the mortgaged land. Thereupon, the defendants moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained the Rule.<br/> <br/>8. On behalf of the defendant-petitioners it was contended before the  High Court Division that the suit was barred by limitation since the same was not filed within 60 years from 28-12-1928 as the mortgage which was made on 27-12-1927 become redeemable on and from 27-12-1928 but the suit was filed on September 27, 1989, Chat the Court of appeal below on misreading the evidence and misconstruing the document as well as the provision of law allowed the appeal upon setting aside the judgment and decree of the trial Court.<br/> <br/>9. As against the contention of the defendant-petitioners it was contended on behalf of the plaintiff opposite parties that the admitted position is that there was a deed of mortgage dated 26-12-1927 and the mortgagors acquired the right of redemption after one year i.e. on and from 26-12-1928, and the suit as per provision of Article 148 of the Limitation Act was required to file within 60 years from aforesaid date and that suit was filed on 27.9,1989 while 60 years expired on 26-12-1988 and thus though apparently it appears that the suit was barred by limitation but because of the provision of Article 4 of the Bangladesh (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1972 (President's Order No. 12 of 1972) the suit was not barred by limitation since the period between the 1st day of March, 1971 and the 1st day of March 1972 (both days inclusive) shall be excluded and, as such, the suit so filed was not barred by limitation. It was also contended by the learned Advocate for the plaintiff-opposite parties that in case of ambiguity, inconsistency or conflict between the substantive provision of the statute and the preamble of the statute then in that case the provision of law in the relevant section of the statute shall be given effect.  It was also contended before the High Court Division that because of the provision of Article 4 of the President's Order No.12 of 1972, hereinafter referred to as the Order, there is no scope to mitigate the provision of said section upon making reference to the preamble of the Order.<br/> <br/>10. The High Court Division in the background of the Exhibit 1 deed of mortgage dated 26-12-1927, held that plaintiffs filed the suit on 27-9-1989 i.e. 9 months after the date of expiry of the period of limitation dated 26-12-1928 since the mortgagors' right of redemption accrued on 26-12-1928 with the expiry of one year from the date of mortgage dated 26-12-1927, and, as such, it appears that the plaintiffs waived their right of redemption, that provision of Article 4 of PO 12 of 1972 is applicable as regard a case where a person could not because of the abnormal situation from 1st  of March, 1971 to 1st of March, 1972 institute or initiate legal proceedings and, as such, his claim or suit become barred by limitation and that plaintiffs' suit being not of that kind or in, other words, plaintiffs' suit is not of a kind which become barred by limitation in between 1st of March, 1971 and 1st of March, 1972, both days inclusive, rather his suit become barred on 26-12-1988 i.e. much long after the period as in Article 4 of the P.O. 12 of 1972 and, as such, provision of Article 4 of P.O. 12 of 1972 is not applicable to plaintiffs' suit. On the aforesaid findings the High Court Division made the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>11. The learned Advocate for the petitioner has reiterated the contention which he made upon referring to the provision of P.O. 12 of 1972 before the High Court Division. To appreciate the contention of the learned Advocate for the petitioners the preamble and the Article 4 of the President's Order 12 of 1972 are quoted below:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"The preamble - Where as during the material period there was disruption of normal life and activities throughout Bangladesh;<br/> <br/>And whereas due to the reign of terror perpetrated by the Pakistan occupation army people were not able to go to Courts or Tribunals either to institute legal proceedings or to defend them so as to comply with directions issued by Courts or Tribunals and as a result many claims and legal rights have become time-barred and many legal proceedings have been disposed of ex parte or in default of compliance with directions of the Court or Tribunals.<br/> <br/>And whereas, for the ends of justice, it is necessary to provide for the saving of limitation for all legal proceedings and for the nullification of all judgments, decrees and orders passed ex parte or in default of compliance with certain directions in certain legal proceedings; and<br/> <br/>Article 4.- Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, in computing the period of limitation prescribed for any legal proceeding by or under any law, the period between the 1st day of March, 1971 and the 1st day of March, 1972 (both days inclusive), shall be excluded”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>12. It is not disputed that the mortgage was made on 26-12-1927 and it was the stipulation in the mortgage deed that the mortgagors would be able to redeem the mortgage after one year from 27-12-1927. In that state of the matter the right of redemption accrued on December 26 of 1928 and from that date within 60 years as per Article 148 of the Limitation Act the plaintiffs were required to file the suit for redemption by 26-12-1988 but they filed the suit on 27-9-1989 i.e. after expiry of the period of limitation or, in other words, after 9 months after the period prescribed by law for seeking the relief of redemption of mortgage. The learned Counsel for the petitioner, who also represented the petitioners before the High Court Division, has not disputed that the suit was filed after the time prescribed by the Limitation Act but it was his contention that because of the provision of Article 4 of the P.O. 12 of 1972 which provides that period between the 1st day of March, 1971 and the 1st day of March, 1972, both the days inclusive as shall be excluded in computing period of limitation and thus the suit is not barred by limitation. It has also been submitted by the learned Counsel for the petitioner that the provision of Article 4 of the P.O. 12 of 1972 being clear and free from ambiguity, as such, upon resorting to the preamble of P.O. 12 of 1972 the High Court Division was in error in holding that the suit was barred by limitation on the view since plaintiffs' suit was not of the kind which became barred between 1st of March, 1971 and 1st of March 1972 or, in other words, plaintiffs are not of the category of the person who because of the abnormal situation in 1971 and thereafter up to 1st day of March, 1972 could not initiate their proceeding seeking redemption of the mortgage and thereupon their right to seek relief by way of redemption of the mortgage became barred and, as such, the suit so filed by the plaintiffs is barred by limitation since the same has been filed after the lapse of the statutory period of limitation. The learned Counsel in support of his contention that in the absence of ambiguity, inconsistency or conflict between the preamble and the substantive provision in the statute the substantive provision of law in the statute shall be given effect to has referred to the case of Nurun Nabi Mondal and others vs. Joynal Abedin Khondkar and others reported in 29 DLR (SC) 137. It appears to us the whole contention of the learned Advocate for the petitioner is that the preamble of P.O. 12 of 1972 shall not control or restrict the substantive provision in Article 4 of the P.O. 12 of 1972. We have no reason to take different view other than the proposition of law laid down in the reported case as to that "the preamble of an Act cannot control or restrict the substantive provision of the Act and that it can be of some guidance if there is an ambiguity in the sections or some doubt as to the true scope of the provisions of that enactment" and that preamble cannot curtail or restrict the scope of the Act. In the preamble of P.O. 12 of 1972 it has been stated "......due to the reign of terror perpetrated by the Pakistan occupation army people were not able to go to courts or Tribunals" to institute legal proceeding "and as a result many claims and legal rights have become time barred ......." and, as such, "for the ends of justice, it is necessary to provide for the   saving of limitation for all legal proceedings...... " The object of enacting the P.O. 12 of 1972 was for saving the limitation of claims and legal rights that became barred because of the situation in 1971 and some time thereafter. The sole object and purpose of the provisions in Article 4 of the P.O. 12 of 1972 was to give life to the claims and legal rights that became barred between 1st March, 1971 and 1st March, 1972 (both days inclusive). In Article 4 it has been provided that "in computing the period of limitation prescribed for any legal proceeding by or under any law, the period between the 1st day of march, 1971 and the 1st day of March, 1972 (both days inclusive), shall be excluded". So, from the reading of the provision of Article 4 of the Order it is seen that where a person could not go to "the Courts or Tribunals" in between 1st March, 1971 and 1st March, 1972 (both days inclusive) to institute legal proceeding "and as a result" claims or legal rights of such person have become time barred in that situation for attaining the object and for achieving the purpose of saving claim or legal right from being barred by limitation, as in the preamble, and keeping in view the object and purpose law as in Article 4 of the P.O. 12 of 1972 has been enacted for saving the claims and legal rights from being time barred. In Article 4 of P.O. 12 of 1972 provision has been made "for the saving of limitation for all legal proceedings" and for excluding specified period "in computing the period of limitation prescribed for any legal proceeding by or under any law" as regard the 'claims and legal rights that have become time barred' as one could not or was not able, for special reason as in the preamble of P.O. 12 of 1972, 'to go to Court or Tribunals' 'to institute legal proceedings'. The legal proceeding as to which the provision of Article 4 shall apply is very much explicit as to which kind of proceeding the said provision shall apply when read with the preamble of P.O. 12 of 1972. The provision of law as in Article 4 of P.O. 12 of 1972 has been enacted to meet 'the ends of justice' upon making provision 'for the saving of limitation for all proceedings' those have become time barred as because people could not initiate legal proceedings "due to the reign of terror perpetrated by the Pakistan occupation army" or, in other words, a new lease of life was given to time barred claims and legal rights as well as to the legal proceedings that became time barred upon excluding the specified period in computing the period of limitation i.e. "the period between the 1st day of March, 1971 and the 1st day of March, 1972 (both day inclusive) shall be excluded". So, it is seen that the provision of Article 4 of P.O. 12 of 1972 would be applicable to 'the claims and legal rights' as well as to a legal proceeding that had become barred by limitation as because legal proceeding could not be instituted because of the situation as spelt out in the preamble of P.O. 12 of 1972. To avail of the provision of law as in Article 4 of P.O. 12 of 1972 as regard claim and legal right as well as legal proceeding the same shall have to be time-barred one because of the situation as in the preamble of P.O. 12 of 1972 and then said claim and legal right as well as legal proceeding would be given life by excluding the period "between the 1st day of March, 1971 and the 1st day of March, 1972 (both days inclusive)". The suit filed by the plaintiff-petitioners was not the one that became time barred "during the material period" as they could not file the suit "due to the reign of terror perpetrated by the Pakistan occupation army". The 'material period' during which legal proceeding could not be instituted and consequently, became time barred has been mentioned in Article 4 of the Order. The provision of law as in Article 4 of PO 2 of 1972 has been enacted to exclude specified period "for all legal proceeding" those have become time barred between the period as has been mentioned in Article 4 of the Order. The whole object of the provision of Article 4 of P.O. 12 of 1972 is "for the saving of limitation for all legal proceedings" that have become time barred at a time as mentioned in Article 4 of the Order or, in other words, in computing the period of limitation in respect of a proceeding which has become time barred between the period as mentioned in Article 4 of the Order the same would be excluded and thereby one whose claim or legal right has become time barred or one who could not institute legal proceedings during the period as mentioned in Article 4 of the Order would be extended in computing the period of limitation or, in other words, class of legal proceedings or claim and legal right has become time barred during the material period as in Article 4 of the Order for further one year but after the expiry of period as in Article 4 of the Order i.e. the claim or legal right of a person would certainly become time barred. The legal proceeding too. We are of the view the provision of Article 4 of the Order has no application to the legal proceeding that did not become time barred during the material period as mentioned therein. In the instant case it is apparent that plaintiffs, claim of redemption did not become barred by limitation during the period as mentioned in Article 4 of the Order. The plaintiffs' right to file suit seeking redemption became time barred on 26-12-1988. In that state of the matter we are of the view the contention of the learned Advocate of the plaintiff petitioners that plaintiffs' suit was not barred by limitation since he would get one year more from 26-12-1988 and thus the period for filing the suit seeking redemption was to expire in December, 1989 but the suit having been filed on 27th September, 1989 the same was not barred by limitation legally not well founded and sustainable.<br/> <br/>13. In the background of our discussions, we are of the view the High Court Division was not in error in holding that the plaintiffs' suit was barred by limitation.<br/> <br/>Accordingly the petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
