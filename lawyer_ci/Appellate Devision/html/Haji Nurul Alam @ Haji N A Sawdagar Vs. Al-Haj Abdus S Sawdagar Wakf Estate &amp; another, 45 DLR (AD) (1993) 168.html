Both the trial Court, Assistant Judge, 1st Court, Chittagong in OS No. 215 of 1989 by Judgment and order dated 28.3.90 and the lower appellate Court, Additional District Judge, 4th Court, Chittagong; in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 88 of 1990 by Judgment and order dated 12.6.91 rejected the plaintiff-Respondent’s prayer for temporary injunction. In revision, Civil Revision No. 1984 of 1991 dated 11. 11.91, a learned Single Judge of the High Court Division made the Rule absolute, passed an order of status quo restraining the appellant from making any construction over the land in dispute.<br/> <br/>2. Respondent No. 1 instituted the aforesaid suit on 11.10.89 for declaration of title to, recovery of possession and permanent injunction in respect of the suit land described in Schedule 1 (Ka) to the plaint. The plaintiff is a Wakf Estate and the owner of Schedule 1 land bearing RS Plot No. 799. The Mutwalli, a lady, runs a madrasha out of the rent-receipts of Schedule 1 land. To the contiguous west of the said plot No. 799, there is a vacant space measuring 68' X 3' running north-south which is Schedule 1 (Ka) to the plaint, the suit land. This strip of land measuring 204 square feet is included with in the plaintiffs RS plot No. 799. To the contiguous west of this strip of land, the suit land, lies RS plot No. 798 which is Schedule 11 land and which belongs to defendant No. 1 There is no boundary wall in between the two plots, and in fool it was inconvenient to build one as the northern portion of both the plots were low nal lands. Taking advantage of the absence of any boundary wall in between the two plots defendant No. 1, enlisting the collusive support of defendant No. 2, a tenant under the plaintiff in the southern portion of plot No. 799, illegally encroached upon the aforesaid Schedule 1 (Ka) land and had excavated foundation of a pucca wall thereon without keeping any vacant space between the two plots.<br/> <br/>3. On the very date of filing the suit, i.e. on 11.10.89 the plaintiff also filed the application for temporary injunction and on the same date a Pleader Commissioner was appointed for local inspection upon the plaintiffs prayer ex parte. The Pleader Commissioner held local inspection on the same day at 4.00 PM and submitted his report on 5.11.89 stating, inter alia, that on schedule 1 (ka) land by the side of the westernmost comer of the plaintiff’s shop room, a new pucca wall is being constructed upon an existing old wall and that there are house building materials amassed on Schedule II land.<br/> <br/>4. Defendant No. 1 contested the application for temporary injunction by filing a written objection on 10‑2.90, stating, inter alia, that the contesting defendant has not constructed any new building on one inch more than what he had before, nor is there any scope for any encroachment. There was and is no vacant space in between plot Nos. 798 and 799. The plaintiff has three kinds of constructions on his plot No. 799. The southern portion consists of a semi‑pucca one‑storied house, behind that is a wooden two‑storied house and behind that is a house consisting of a pucca bathroom. The westernmost wall of the semi‑pucca house of the plaintiff is the eastern boundary house. Some portion of the northern side of the plaintiffs’ house is the house of the contesting defendant. The westernmost pucca pillars and wooden pillars of the wooden house of the plaintiff were attached to the contesting defendant's plot was walled up, but in major part of the plaintiffs plot there was no boundary wall. The easternmost walls of the house of contesting defendant were being used by plaintiff as the westernmost wall of her house. The contesting defendant purchased RS plot No. 798 eleven years ago and his predecessor obtained his deed on 27.4.38. The building of the plaintiffs father was shown as the eastern boundary of the purchased plot of the contesting defendant. The contesting defendant further contended that he has already constructed from July 1989 a one‑storied building on the northern side of his plot by demolishing the old one and it is only when he started excavating foundation of another multi‑storied building in the southern portion after obtaining sanctioned plan from the Chittagong Development Authority that the plaintiff belatedly filed the suit on 11.10.89, although the northern portion was completed before 7.10.89. Besides, he has evicted tenants who have to be accommodated in the proposed building and has amassed huge construction materials in RS plot No. 798.<br/> <br/>5. On the prayer of the contesting defendant, another Pleader Commissioner was appointed who submitted his report on 27.11.89 stating, inter alia, that the contesting defendant had completed the one‑storied building on the northern portion of the plot, the great beam of which has been constructed upon an old wall whose remnants are visible and that the contesting defendant had raised construction towards the southern portion of his plot upto the plinth level.<br/> <br/>6. The trial Court rejected the prayer for temporary injunction on four grounds. First, on consideration of the appellant's kabala dated 27.4.39 the Court came to a finding that the two holdings on RS Plots Nos. 798 and 799 were contiguous and there was no vacant space in between. Secondly, from a perusal of both the reports of the pleader Commissioners it does not appear that appellant had illegally annexed Schedule 1 (Ka) land. Thirdly, the appellant has amassed huge construction materials in his own plot and there is no reason to injunct him in these circumstances, and lastly, the loss that the plaintiff may sustain in case the injunction is refused will not be greater than the loss which the appellant will sustain and the plaintiffs apprehended loss can be monetarily compensated.<br/> <br/>7. The appellate Court below upheld the Judgment and order of the trial Court solely on the ground that on consideration of the reports of the two Pleader Commissioners, it does not appear that the contesting defendant was raising construction upon annexing the plaintiff's land.<br/> <br/>8. The learned Single Judge of the High Court Division took the view that since there was no boundary wall in between the two plots, the dispute has arisen between the parties. If it is ultimately found that the disputed Schedule 1 (Ka) land belongs to the plaintiff, several legal complications will arise. Hence, in the interest of justice, the High Court Division directed the parties to maintain status quo in respect of the suit land and the defendants were restrained from making any construction over the land in dispute. The learned Single Judge also directed the trial Court to appoint a Pleader Commissioner immediately in order to measure the two plots of land and demarcate their areas as per documents by a competent surveyor and upon receipt of the report of the Pleader Commissioner, the trial Court was directed to proceed with and dispose of the suit in accordance with law.<br/> <br/>9. Leave was granted to consider the submission of the defendant No. 1 that the High Court Division, without reversing the concurrent finding of fact that the appellant was not building upon the plaintiff's land, erred in law in granting status quo in the matter. The suit was not one for determining the boundaries of the land of the parties and such question was never raised. It was submitted that the High Court Division has made out a third case. It was also submitted that the apprehension of several legal complications was not founded on concurrent finding of facts as the two Pleader Commissioners and the two Courts below found that there was no vacant space west of plot No. 799 and that the appellant erected his eastern walls on an old one. Lastly, it was submitted that the balance of convenience and inconvenience was heavily in the appellant's favour in view of the fact that he had amassed huge construction material on his plot and that he had a sanctioned building plan in his favour, a fact which was not considered by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>10. Mr. Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed, learned Counsel for the appellant, has pointed out the relevant findings of fact of the two Courts below in so far as the plaintiffs allegations concerning a vacant space of land is concerned and has submitted that temporary injunction was refused by both the Courts below on the concurrent ground that it could not be established by the two reports of the two Pleader Commissioners that there was any vacant space in between the two plots, which was the sheet‑anchor of the plaintiffs case. It is apparent, he submits, that the High Court Division has failed to reverse the said concurrent finding of fact and has passed an order of status quo and temporary injunction without accepting the plaintiffs basic case.<br/> <br/>11. Mr. Asrarul Hossain, learned Counsel for the plaintiff‑respondent, submits, on the other hand, that there is no concurrent finding of fact by the two courts below as to the vacant space complained of by the respondent.<br/> <br/>12. Mr. Asrarul Hossain is not correct. The two Courts below, as we have already noticed, gave a clear finding that the appellant had not annexed the respondent's land while constructing his building and that there was no vacant space in between the two buildings. In disturbing the concurrent Judgment of the two Courts below, it was imperative on the part of the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division to reverse the said concurrent finding and to hold that the respondent had made out a prima facie case for temporary injunction. No doubt, the High Court Division passed the impugned order "in the interest of justice", but the two Courts below gave some findings in favour of the respondent, and before turning the wheels of justice in favour of the respondent, the High Court Division ought to have found that the respondent had a prima facie case for injunction.<br/> <br/>13. The trial Court had clearly opined from a perusal of the appellant's purchase documents that the building of the plaintiffs father was the eastern boundary of the plaintiff s land. The trial Court also found that the appellant had gathered immense house building materials on his plot of land and that the balance of inconveniences are heavily in his favour. The High Court Division does not appear to have adverted to these findings at all. Consequently, the reversal of the two Courts' Judgment in revisions without any legal foundation.         <br/> <br/>14. Mr. Asraful Hossain has devoted a good part of his arguments mainly on the High Court Division's penultimate order directing the trial Court to appoint a survey-knowing Pleader Commissioner to measure the two plots and has submitted that the order has been passed in the interest of justice to determine the real controversy between the parties.<br/> <br/>15. It appears that after having granted status quo in the matter and after restraining the appellant from making any construction over the suit land, the High Court Division passed the aforesaid order in aid of the suit itself. Mr. Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed rightly pointed out that the defendant-appellant has not yet filed his written statement and the issues of the suit have not yet been framed. Whether it will at all be necessary to measure the two plots in question and how far the result of the survey will determine the respective legal rights of the parties is too premature to contemplate, as, even the trial Court today does not know the points of controversy between the parties. The temporary injunction matter was fought solely on the issue as to whether the appellant was making construction on a vacant space of land measuring 68'x 3' belonging to the respondent and on the evidence available for the purpose of temporary injunction, the two Courts below gave a finding thereon and decided the temporary injunction matter against the respondent. It is too early now for the High Court Division to pass any order in aid of the suit itself as the issues in controversy in the main suit are yet to emerge.<br/> <br/>16. For all the above reasons we do not think that the High Court Division was well‑founded in jaw in interfering in revision.<br/> <br/>17. Mr. Asrarul Hossain submits that the appellant has constructed his building in violation of the Building Construction Act, 1952. He was served with a notice under section 3 thereof and having admitted the violation, he has expressed regret in the face of his conduct, there should be a temporary injunction pending disposal of the suit.<br/> <br/>18. It is not clear from the notice under section 3 of the Building Construction Act, 1952, found in the paper book herein, whether the violation complained of relates to the appellant's alleged encroachment upori4he respondent's land or for other reasons. In any view of the matter the proceeding under the Building Construction Act, 1952, is a matter different from the present proceeding for temporary injunction and if the appellant is found guilty of violation of the provisions of Building Construction Act, the law will take its own course in spite of this Judgment.<br/> <br/>19. Mr. Asrarul Hossain next submits that the respondent will suffer irreparable loss and injury if the appellant continues with his construction for an indefinite period and to minimise the respondent's apprehended loss the suit should be disposed of expeditiously within a stated period.<br/> <br/>20. Such suits ought to be disposed of expeditiously irrespective of whether the plaintiff will suffer any loss or not.<br/> <br/>21. Hence, the appeal is allowed without costs, OS No. 215 of 1989 of the 1st Court of Assistant Judge, Chittagong, is directed to be dispoed of as early as possible, not later than the 30h November, 1992.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
