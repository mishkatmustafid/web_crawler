His suit challenging the alienation by a widow of the property left by her late husband has been dismissed by the appellate Court on setting aside the trial Court's judgment. The High Court Division in revi­sion did not interfere with the appellate Court's deci­sion. The impugned order of the High Court Divi­sion is dated 21 May 1986 made in Civil Revision No. 785 of 1982 (Barisal).<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong> Widow Manikko Bewa sold property No.1 Schedule 'Ka' by a sale-deed dated 19 March 1926 to the predecessor of respondent No.1. She gifted away property No. 3 in Schedule 'Kha' by a Deed of Gift dated 3 May 1967 to respondent No. 2, a School. She died three years later. Case of the petitioner is that neither of the two alienations was made for any legal necessity and as such these alienations were in­valid. The trial Court held in his favour but the ap­pellate Court found that the first alienation under a sale-deed was made for repayment of debt, redemp­tion of a mortgage property and for making pilgrim­age to a holy place and as such it was for legal ne­cessity. As to the dedication by the Deed of Gift the appellate Court found that it was for a holy purpose. The learned Single Judge of the High Court Divi­sion concurred in this finding.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> Mr. S.R. Pal, learned Counsel for the peti­tioner, does not seriously challenge the validity of the transfer by the kabala of the year 1926; but he seriously contends that the dedication in favour of an educational institution is neither for any legal neces­sity nor for any 'religious or charitable purpose'. He has referred to Mulla's Hindu Law and has tried to show that the dedication to a school docs not come within the ambit of dedication for religious or charitable purpose. The learned Counsel, however, agrees that dedication to a temple of worship is a dedication for a religious purpose. Dedication for religious or charitable purposes, we think, includes dedication to hospital, university and other educational institutions since these are intended for the benefit and wel­fare of the Society as a whole and in context of a modern progressive Society, an educational institu­tion is regarded as a temple of learning.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> The petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></span></div></div></div>
