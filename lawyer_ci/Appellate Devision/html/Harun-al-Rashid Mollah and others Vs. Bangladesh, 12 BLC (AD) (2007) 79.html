Aftab Hossain, Advocate-on-Record - For the Petitioners.<br/>Not Represented - The Respondents.<br/> <br/><strong>Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 1131 of 2004.</strong><br/>(From the judgment and order dated 3-3-2004 passed by the High Court Division in Appeal from Original Decree (FA) No. 147 of 1989).<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong><u>Md. Tafazzul Islam J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This civil petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and decree dated 3-3-2004 passed by the High Court Division in dismissing First Appeal No. 147 of 1989 which was filed against the judgment and decree dated 5-8-1989 passed by the Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Second Court, Dhaka in Title Suit No. 213 of 1976 dismissing the suit.<br/> <br/>2. The petitioner, as plaintiff, filed the above suit seeking declaration of his title in the suit land as described in the schedule of the plaint stating, inter alia, that the suit land originally belonged to Dhaka Nawab Court of Wards Estate in Khas and the CS record of right was accordingly prepared; Quijrat Ali Mollah, the father of the plaintiffs, took pattan of 10 acres of land appertaining to CS Plot No. 13 under CS Khatian No. 13 from Dhaka Nawab Court of Wards Estate on payment of Nazar of Rs. 510 and that the said Quijrat Ali Mollah also obtained settlement of another parcel of land measuring 10 acres appertaining to CS Plot No. 24 of CS Khatian No. 10 from Dhaka Nawab Court of Wards Estate on payment of Nazar of Rs.690; after the death of Quijrat Ali Mollah the plaintiffs are possessing the said lands forming one compact block measuring a total of 20 acres of land which is well demar­cated on all sides by boundary walls; in the initial record of right the suit land having been recorded as forest land of the Government and the plaintiffs filed Miscellaneous Case No. 1300 of 1963 for correction of the records of right which being allowed the records of right were then correctly prepared in the names of the plaintiffs and then the defendants filed appeal and the Settlement Officer by order dated 18-4-1969 illegally allowed the appeal and cancelled the RS Khatian No. 74 created in the names of the plaintiffs and the suit land was ordered to be recorded in the name of the Forest Depart­ment and then the defendant issued a Gazette Notification being No. 3125 dated 13-4-1955 showing the suit land as the land of Forest Department and hence the suit.<br/> <br/>3. The defendants contested the suit by filing written statement contending that the suit land was declared as protected forest land by Gazette Notification No. 3125 dated 13-4-1955 and since then the suit land along with other lands have been under the management and possession of the Government; the Forest Department then planted many valuable forest trees therein and in order to convert the suit land as Reserve Forest appointed the Collector, Dhaka, as Forest Settlement Officer with direction to admit any claim or objection filed within 90 days from the date of the above notification in respect of the land shown in the above Gazette Notification dated 13-4-1955 but none including the plaintiffs came forward with any claim over the said land including the suit land and then under Memo No. 3735(2)1812 dated 15-9-1967 the Government made the suit land as Reserve Forest; the management of the suit land was although under the Government and the alleged settlement in the name of the father of the plaintiffs is on the basis of forged, collusive, fraudulent and ante-dated papers which has been created for the purpose of the suit, the ex-rent receiver had no right or authority to settle the forest land with the predecessor of the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs or their predecessor did not acquire any title or interest in the suit land on the basis of the alleged settlement as the suit land was a protected forest land of the Government. The trial Court dismissed the suit holding that the plaintiffs could not prove the settlement. The plaintiffs then preferred First Appeal No.147 of 1989 and after hearing the High Court Division dismissed the appeal.<br/> <br/>4. We have heard the learned Counsel for the appellant and perused the records including the impugned judgment and decree passed by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>5. As it appears the High Court Division found that Exhibit 2, the rent receipt on which the plaintiffs relied, relates to the rent of 10 acres of land of CS Plot No. 13 under CS Khatian No. 13 but though in Exhibit 2 the name of the rent receivers have been printed but no one from the Dhaka Nawab Court of Wards Estate executed or signed the rent receipt and in the same there is also no signature of Tahsilder and the same merely contained the signature of the recipient of the rent receipt on its back side and in respect of Exhibit 4, the rent receipt, on the basis of which the plaintiff claimed settlement of another 10 acres of CS Plot No. 24 under CS Khatian No. 10, the position is also similar. The High Court Division further found that though the back pages of the above rent receipts contained the names of the rent receivers but there is also a recital in the back page  to  the effect that without the approval of the Chief Manager of the Dhaka Nawab Court of Wards Estate no settlement of any land under the management of the above Estate could be granted; Exhibits 2 and 4, the basic documents of title of the plaintiffs, contain over-writings in respect of Khatian No. 24, which can be seen with open eyes and so the same does not inspire any confidence; Exhibit 5, the rent receipts, was also not granted from Dhaka Nawab Court of Wards Estate and further, as found by the trial Court, the plaintiffs neither mentioned about any amalnama in their plaint nor they did produce any amalnama before the trial Court; though in the decision reported in 47 DLR 246 it has been held  that for the purpose of granting lease of agricultural land no written document is required tinder section 3(17) of Bengal Tenancy Act, but the facts of the said decision are quite distinguishable with the facts of the present case; the plaintiff must prove his own case to obtain a decree and can­not depend on the weakness of the defence case and in the case of an ex parte judgment and decree also the trial Court is also bound to consider as to whether the plaintiff has proved his case and the documents produced support the plaintiff's title; in the decision reported in 45 DLR (AD) 112 the Appellate Division has held that how far a judgment passed in an ex-parte proceeding is to comply with the provisions of Order XX, rule 4(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure will depend on facts of each case and a judgment in an ex-parte proceeding shall however state specifically and explicitly which of the reliefs are granted and against which of the defendants; since the plaintiffs failed to prove their title the present case is not a fit case for invoking jurisdiction under Order XLI, rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure for sending the suit on remand to the trial Court for a fresh decision and the facts of the decision reported in 2002 BLD (AD) 42 being distinguishable, the principles laid down therein have no manner of application in the present case.<br/> <br/>6. As it appears the High Court Division also found that Exhibit 8, the order passed by the Revenue Officer, goes to show that the plaintiffs could not prove their title before the Revenue Officer even on 18-4-1969 on the basis of rent receipt exhibits 2, 4 and 5 series and that in Appeal Case No. 2200/6869, filed under section 31 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Rules, 1955 the appellate Court, after scruti­nising Exhibits 2 and 4 produced before it, found that those were forged and fabricated and accordingly, held that no settlement was granted by those rent receipts.<br/> <br/>We are of the view that the High Court Division, considering the pleadings of the parties, the evidence of PW.1 and the documentary evidence including Exhibits 2, 4 and 5 series, arrived at the correct decision holding that the plaintiffs miserably failed to prove their title to the suit land on the basis of alleged settlement and accordingly, no interference is called for. The petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
