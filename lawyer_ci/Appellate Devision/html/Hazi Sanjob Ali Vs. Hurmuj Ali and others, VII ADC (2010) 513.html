Abdul Matin J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 24.07.2008 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.5392 of 2001 discharging the Rule and affirming the judgment and decree dated 14.08.2001 passed by the learned Additional District Judge in Title Appeal No. 69 of 1998 arising out of judg­ment and decree dated 28.10.1998 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, 1st Court, Sunamgonj in Title Suit No.441 of 1985 dismissing the suit.<br/> <br/>2. The facts, in short, are that Hazi Sanjab Ali (since dead) as plaintiff instituted Title Suit No.13 of 1984 (which was later on renumbered as Title Suit No.441 of 1985) in the Court of the learned Subordinate Judge, 1st Court, Sylhet praying for a decree for declaration that he had right, title and interest in the suit land.<br/> <br/>3. The facts of the plaintiffs' case were that the suit land along with other lands origi­nally belonged to Rash Behari Nandi Chowdhury and his other co-shares in their maliki right and while they were in peaceful possession of the same they set­tled the suit land and other lands to Shahar Ullah and four others of Jhamok who exe­cuted a registered kabuliat in their favour on 30th As win, 1325 B.S. the land was originally laik patit in nature and the set­tlement holders reclaimed the same by spending huge amount of money and labour they also paid rent of the same to the zaminder shreesta. The plaintiffs since the time of their predecessors arc in peace­ful possession of the same by growing paddy therein. The share of each of the settlement holders has been recorded sep­arately in their names according to their specific possession during the last settle­ment operation in separate khatians. Among the settlement holders Shahar Ullah died leaving late Mahram Ullah predecessors of plaintiff Nos.4-8 and plaintiff Nos.1-3 as his surviving legal heirs who are in peaceful possession of the suit land till today. The suit plot had been recorded in the names of the heirs of Shahar Ullah but the area had been wrong­ly recorded as 1.58 acres in place of 2.18 acres of which fact the plaintiffs were not at all aware. Subsequently Moharam Ali died leaving behind plaintiff Nos.4-8 and pro-defendant Nos.13-15 as his surviving legal heirs. The plaintiffs have been hold­ing and possessing the suit land by paying the rent thereof to the government. The plaintiff are all almost illiterate and the) have no knowledge or experience about settlement affairs and they were in firm behalf that the suit land had been rightly recorded in their names during the last set­tlement operation. Recently by the first week of Agrahayan, 1390 B.S. the defen­dants for the first time declared in the locality that the suit land has been record­ed in their name and as such they are own­ers of the suit land. On scrutiny it was found that the suit land also had been recorded within khatian No. 106 in the name of the predecessors of the defen­dants.<br/> <br/>4. The defendant Nos.1-3 contested the suit by filing a written statement wherein the plaint case has been denied. The spe­cific defence case is that Ismail and others and predecessors of these defendants took settlement of the suit land through a kabuliyat dated 30th Aswin, 1325 B.S. that thereafter the entire land covered by kabuliyat was partitioned and suit land fell in the saham of Ismail the predecessor of these defendants. Ismail died leaving four daughters Godar, Gedi, Ayiul and Sayful and maternal cousin Ain Ullah to inherit his properties. On an amicable partition amongst the heirs of Ismail the suit land fell in the saham of Ain Ullah alone. After the death of Ain Ullah the suit land has been correctly recorded in the name of his son Mazumder Ali. While Mazumder Ali was in possession of the suit land, he died leaving these defendants as his heirs to inherit and these defendants since then as heirs enjoyed the suit land by paying rents and taxes to the Government. The suit is not maintainable as it does not included "" the entire lands of the kabuliyat in the hotch pot. The record of the suit land has been correctly prepared and published. The suit having been instituted long after the preparation of settlement record the plaintiffs are not entitled to any relief and the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/>5. On consideration of evidence of both the parties the learned Subordinate Judge dismissed the suit by the judgment and order dated 28.10.1998.<br/> <br/>6. Being aggrieved the plaintiff preferred Title Appeal No.69 of 1998 before the learned District Judge, Sunamgonj which was heard by the learned Additional District Judge, Sunamgonj who by the judgment and decree dated 14.08.2001 dismissed the appeal and affirmed the judgment of the trial court.<br/> <br/>7. Being aggrieved the plaintiff moved Civil Revision No. 5892 of 2001 before the High Court Division and obtained Rule along with an order of status-quo in respect of possession of the suit land by the parties.<br/> <br/>8. The said Rule was heard by the High Court Division which discharged the Rule by judgment and order dated 24.07.2008.<br/> <br/>9. As against the judgment and order of the High Court Division the petitioners have filed this petition for leave to appeal.<br/> <br/>10. Heard Mr. Md. Mozaffar Hossain, the learned Counsel appearing for the peti­tioners and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/> <br/>11. It appears that the High Court Division correctly held that "it is crystal clear from the deposition of P.W.1 as well as from the documents submitted by the plaintiff that they could not file a single piece of rent receipt of the suit land. On the other hand the defendant has filed several pieces of rent receipts and S.A. khatian stands in the name of the ancestor of the defendants."<br/> <br/>12. It further appears that the plaintiff could not prove their possession in the suit land either by oral and documentary evi­dence.<br/> <br/>13. In such view of the matter all the courts below correctly decided the matter in favour of the defendants and upheld the judgment of the trial court that correctly dismissed the suit.<br/> <br/>We find no substance in this petition which is accordingly dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
