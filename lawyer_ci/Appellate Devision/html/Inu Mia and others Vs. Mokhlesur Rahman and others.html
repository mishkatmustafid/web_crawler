Respondents 1-6 claimed to be co‑sharers by inheritance and respondents 7-9 claimed to be co-sharers: by purchase. The land originally belonged to one Sadat Ali Kari, predecessor-in-interest of respondents 1-6 and as such they claimed as co-sharers by inheritance. Respondents 7-9 claimed to be co-sharers by purchase in the same jote. Respondent 10 sold the case land to Chand Mia, the predecessor in‑interest of appellants 1-8 and respondent No. 52 by a kabala dated March, 14, 1972 and the said Chand Mia was also a co‑sharer of the same jote by purchase. The pre‑emptors' case is that on hearing about the sale after making necessary search in the Sub‑Registrar's office and on taking a certified copy of the Kabala on March 8, 1973 they came to know for the first time about the transfer of the case land. Their further case is that no notice of sale was served upon them and that in order to avoid pre‑emption the kabala was registered in a different Sub‑Registry.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> The trial Court allowed the Miscellaneous case being Miscellaneous Case No. 133 of 1973 against the deceased Chand Mia and ex parte against the rest. On appeal the Appellate Court modified the order to the effect that the pre-emptor respondents are to get 76 ½ decimals of land and deceased Chand Mia, the pre‑emptee, to get 8 ½  decimals of land by pre‑emption. Chand Miah moved the High Court under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The High Court set aside the order of Appellate Court and restored that of the Munsif with modification to the effect allowing pre‑emption in favour of the pre-emptor-respondents 1-6 and refusing pre‑emption in respect of the pre-emptor-respondents 7-9. The heirs and legal representatives of deceased Chand Mia obtained leave from this Division contending that the respondents 1-6 have no locus standi to apply for pre-emption inasmuch as their predecessor in‑interest Sadat Ali Kari himself did not choose to file an application for pre‑emption although he was alive till then.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> The question raised in this appeal can be answered by applying the test whether the right of pre‑emption is a personal right or it is attached to the property under pre-emption.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> Section 96 provides right of pre‑emption to the co‑sharers and to the persons having land contiguous to the land transferred. In both the cases the person claiming pre‑emption must show his existing interest in the land, that is, in the case of a co‑sharer it must be proved that the pre-emptor has got subsisting interest in the holding and in the case of contiguous-owner it must be proved that the pre-emptor has got subsisting interest in the land contiguous to the land sold. In either of the cases the interest in the holding or in the contiguous land must subsist till the order of pre-emption is made. After filing pre‑emption either claiming to be a co‑sharer in the holding or claiming to be an owner of contiguous land, if the pre-emptor ceases to have interest in the land in question the pre-emption cases fails. On the death of the pre-emptor this right is not lost, because, the pre-emptor's heirs or their heirs inherit the right along with the land. In a pending proceeding the heirs are entitled to be substituted in the place of the deceased pre-emptor and proceed with the case. So also the right of pre‑emption once accrued, the right of pre‑emption does not lapse in the event of death, but it devolves upon his legal heirs. The legal heirs inheriting the land arc competent to exercise the right of pre‑emption in accordance with the law.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> Mr. Abdus Salam, the learned Counsel appearing for the appellant, submitted that Sadat Ali Kari being alive at the time of the sale and he having not riled any application for pre-emption proceeding his heirs are not competent to start pre‑emption proceeding.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> This question was argued before the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division submitting that since the right derived is an individual right, the same is not heritable and accordingly, on the death of Sadat Ali Kari the pre-emptors 1-6 did not acquire any right of pre-emption in respect of the impugned transfer. From the Judgment it appears that the learned Judge did not consider it necessary to answer the question, because, admittedly no notice of transfer was served upon Sadat Ali Kari, and as such it should be presumed that he had no knowledge of the transfer during his lifetime. The pre-emptee also could not establish that Sadad Ali Kari had knowledge about the sale. In view of this position the question could not be pressed further.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> Mr. Abdus Salam attempted to raise the question of waiver of the right of pre‑emption by Sadat Ali Kari. In view of concurrent finding that Sadat Ali Kari was a non-notified co-sharer and the pre-emptee could not establish by leading evidence that he had knowledge about the transfer, there is no scope for raising the question of waiver of the right. Both the contentions of the appellant fail. Therefore, the appeal is dismissed with costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
