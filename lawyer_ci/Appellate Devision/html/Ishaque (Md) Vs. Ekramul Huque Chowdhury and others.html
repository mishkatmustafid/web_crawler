Gholam Rabbani J:</strong>Two brothers respondent Nos. 1 and 2, instituted a title suit against the appellant for a decree of khas possession after evicting the defendant including the appellant from the suit premises which is a shop room of 15 cubits in length and 10 cubits in breadth bearing municipal new folding No. 208 of Mahalla Jamal Khan at 82, Shahid Saifuddin Khaled Road within the municipality of Chittagong and also for arrear rents and compensation for use and occupations.  <br/> <br/>2. Plaint case, in short, was this. Jana Jiban Dutta was the owner of the suit premises. He let out the same to the defendant-appellant as a monthly tenant. Jana Jiban Dutta died leaving a daughter Kiran Bala. Kiran Bala embraced ‘Islam’ and took the name of Khairunnessa. She sold the suit premises to the plaintiffs-respondents by two registered deeds of sale both dated 8-9-74. The plaintiffs terminated the tenancy by a registered notice under section 106 of the T.P Act.  <br/> <br/>3. Defendant No. 1 appellant contest the suit by filing a written statement. His case, in short was this. He took lease of the suit premises from Jana Jiban Dutta in 1952 and made construction thereon. He recorded his name in the municipality and also in the PS Khatian. He denied relationship of landlord and monthly tenant between himself and the plaintiff or their vendor. Other non- contesting defendants are the tenants under the defendant No. 1.  <br/> <br/>4. The trial Court dismissed the suits Plaintiffs then preferred appeal. The First Court of Subordinate Judge who heard the appeal allowed the appeal and decreed the suit. Said contesting defendant then obtained Rule in Civil Revision No 4480 of 1991 from the High Court Division. The Rule was ultimately discharged by the judgment order dated 30-8-94 affirming the judgment decree of the lower appellate court. This appeal is directed against the said judgment and order of the High Court Division.  <br/> <br/>5. We have heard Mr. Ahmed the learned Advocate for the appellant. He has argued the appeal in terms of the leave granting order and our consideration thereof are hereunder.  <br/> <br/>6. There is no dispute as to Jana Jiban Dutta’s ownership in the suit premises and that Kiran Bala succeeded him as his daughter. The disputed issue is whether the defendant-appellant took lease of the suit premises from Jana Jiban Dutta as alleged by him or he was a monthly tenant therein under Jana Jiban Dutta as alleged by the plaintiffs-respondents. High Court Division noticed that PS Khatian, Exhibit B, relating to the suit premises and exhibited by the defendant himself was recorded in the name of the plaintiffs’ Vendor Khairunnessa and in the remark column possession of the defendant was shown as Trespasser since 1952. High Court Division further noticed that there was an agreement of monthly tenancy, Exhibit 14, between Jana Jiban Dutta and the defendant-appellant and that was misread by the trial Court. High Court Division also noticed that the lower appellate Court noticed the inconsistency of the defendant’s claim inasmuch as he stated in a criminal case, Exhibit 12, that he took lease of the suit premises by a registered deed while in the written statement filed in the instant suit he alleged taking lease orally from Jana Jiban Dutta. While oncurring with the finding of the lower appellate Court that the defendant executed a monthly tenancy agreement in favour of Jana Jiban Dutta on 24-7-52 which was proved by PW 2 Bijoy Chandra who was a grandson of Jana Jiban Dutta as Exhibit 14, learned Judge of the High Court Division himself compared the signature of the defendant-appellant appearing in Exhibit 14 with that appearing in the written statement of the defendant and came to the conclusion that both the signatures were of the same hand.  <br/> <br/>7. Mr. Ahmed takes exception to this comparison of the signatures by the High Court Division terming the act as hazardous and dangerous. This submission has long been rejected by the courts. It is well settled that section 73 of the Evidence Act permits the Court to make a comparison of signature or writings and so adoption of such a method cannot be termed as hazardous or dangerous and therefore the finding as to the genuineness of Exhibit 14 cannot be questioned only on this account.  <br/> <br/>8. Mr. Ahmed next submits that the cause for filing of the suit for eviction being denial of the title of the landlord by the tenant the suit must fail in the absence of a notice under section 111(g) of the Transfer of Property Act. The submission has got no merit. Mere reading of section 111(g) of the TP Act it will be clear that only requirement of clause (g) is that the lessor does some act showing his intention to determine the lease and there is no reason why the lessor’s election by way of a notice must be prior to the institution of the suit. In a case of forfeiture of tenancy for denial of title, written notice of lessor’s intention to determine the lease is not compulsory and must be optional as the notice is not a part of the cause of action for such eviction and that the cause of action is the denial of the landlord’s title resulting determination of the tenancy by forfeiture.  <br/> <br/>9. Mr. Ahmed lastly submits that the plaintiffs-respondents could not prove their case so as to get a decree in a simple suit for ejection of monthly tenant. It is well settled that when both the parties have led evidence question of onus is out of place and matter is to be decided on the evidence led by the parties. Herein both the lower appellate court as well as the High Court Division considered the evidence on record adduced by both the parties and came to a concurrent finding that the defendant- appellant was a monthly tenant under the plaintiffs- respondents and that the tenancy stood determined by forfeiture. In view of the discussion as above the appeal fails.  <br/> <br/>In the result, the appeal is dismissed without any order as to costs.  <br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>
