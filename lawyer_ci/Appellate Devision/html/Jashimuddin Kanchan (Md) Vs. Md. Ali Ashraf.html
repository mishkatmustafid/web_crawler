The principal question involved is, whether the learned Single Judge acted within his jurisdiction in reversing the concurrent decision on a question of fact namely, whether the respondent's predecessor-in-interest impliedly surrendered his tenancy right by voluntary abandonment of the suit land.<br/> <br/>2. Appellant (Jashimuddin Kanchan) and re­spondent (Ali Ashraf) both purchassed the same land at about the same time from two rival owners under registered kabalas and thereby entered into the litiga­tion. The land in question measures .05 acre out of .37 acre in plot No. 460 of Khatian No. 127 of Mouza Misri, Laksham. The land originally be­longed to one Badsha Mia, who by an Ijara kabuliyat dated 23 June 1926 leased it to Ram Prosad Muchi, a cobbler by profession, for a period of 5 years at a yearly rent of Tk. 4/-. Badsha Mia then exchanged his entire property including the suit land with Mohesh Chandra Saha by a registered deed of exchange dated 16 October 1936. At the time of the exchange Ram Prosad Muchi was continuing in possession of the suit land by holding over under the Ijara kabuliy­at. Ram Prosad Muchi continued even after this ex­change, but controversy arose since then.<br/> <br/>3. Respondent claimed that Ram Prosad Muchi continued in possession as a Dar-rayati tenant under Mohesh Chandra Saha paying rent to him regularly till April 1956 when on whole-sale acquisition of all rent-receiving interests he became a tenant directly under the Government; on his death his sons, Narayan and Tetna Rabi Das, inherited and possessed the land and then they by a registered kabala dated 16 Baishak 1383 BS. corresponding to 30 March 1977 sold the land to him (respondent) and delivered its possession. He then made new constructions on the land; but in June of that year, he came to know that the appellant had obtained a fraudulent kabala dated 7 May 1977, registered on the following day, from Mo­hesh Chandra Saha's son Upendra Chandra Saha in re­spect of the suit land and on the strength of that kaba­la started to disturb his possession. He, therefore, filed Title Suit No. 223 of 1977 in the 4th Court of Munsif for a declaration that the appellant's kabala dated 7.5.77 (Ext. la) was false and fraudulent.<br/> <br/>4. The appellant, on the other hand, claimed that by the "Ijara kabuliyat" dated 23.6.26 (Ext.8) no Dar-rayati interest was created in favour of Ram Prosad Muchi, that he did not get any other tenancy right but was a mere Ijaradar for a short time, that though he continued as Ijaradar at the time of the exchange of the suit land, he some time after the ex­change, left the suit land and surrendered his posses­sion to the new landlord, Mohesh Chandra Saha and permanently settled at Daulatganj Bazar where he died. Upon surrender of the land by Ram Prosad Mu­chi, the landlord Mohesh Saha entered upon and pos­sessed it as khas land and on his death, his son, Upendra Saha, inherited and possessed it and then, by the registered kabala dated 7 May 1977, as already re­ferred to, transferred it to him (appellant) and deliv­ered its possession. He further alleged that the re­spondent traced out Ram Prosad's sons, who were residing at Daulatganj and obtained from them a fraudulent kabala, Ext. 1, as already referred to, and threatened him with dispossession. Thereupon he filed an application under section 145 CrPC (Misc. Case No. 34 of 1977) before the Sub-divisional Magistrate, Comilla, who started a proceeding there­on, attached the land and appointed the Officer-in-Charge of the Police Station as its receiver. The re­spondent challenged the order of attachment by Criminal Motion No. 361 of 1977 but it was reject­ed by the Sessions Judge. Thereupon the respondent took law in has own hand and dispossessed him (ap­pellant) from a part of the suit land forcibly erecting three huts and cutting away two Mango trees. In the circumstances, he filed Title Suit No. 293 of 1977 in the same court of Munsif praying for declaration of his title to the entire suit land measuring .05 acre and recovery of possession in respect of 0.01 of the suit land.<br/> <br/>5. Both the suits were tried on analogous basis by the Munsif, who by his judgment dated 29 De­cember 1980, dismissed the respondent's suit (Title Suit No. 223 of 1977) and decreed the appellant's suit (Title Suit No. 293 of 1977) upon findings, among other things, that by the Ijara kabuliyat Ram Prosad Muchi did not acquire any Dar-rayati right, that whatever right he got he surrendered it to the landlord and left the place for good and as such his sons inherited nothing to transfer. Respondent pre­ferred appeals in both the suits, Title Appeal No. 36 of 1981 in respect of TS 223 of 1977 and Title Ap­peal 37 of 1981 in respect of TS No. 293 of 1977. Both the appeals were disposed of by the learned Subordinate Judge by a common judgment dated 21 November 1982. Both the appeals were dismissed; but in the case of TA No. 37 of 1981, the decree was conditional, that is, the plaintiff of the suit (appel­lant) was found to have been dispossessed from the entire suit land and not from the area of .01 acre and as such he was advised to amend his plaint paying <em>ad valorem</em> Court fee to seek possession of the entire suit land. (0.5 acre) within 15 days failing which his suit "would stand dismissed". In compliance with this advice of the court he amended the plaint on payment of the necessary Court fee, and consequent­ly, the suit was decreed finally on 30.12.82.<br/> <br/>6. But before the final decree as mentioned above was passed the respondent (Ali Ashraf) chal­lenged the judgment of the appellate Court before the High Court Division by two Revisional Applica­tions under section 115 CPC, Civil Revision No. 117 of 1983 and Civil Revision No. 118 of 1983, arising respectively from Title Appeal Nos. 36 and 37 of 1981. The learned Single Judge heard both the matters together and, by the common impugned judgment dated 29 November 1984, reversed the con­current decision of the courts below, decreed the re­spondent's suit and dismissed the appellant's suit upon finding that Ram Muchi acquired Dar-rayati in­terest from the landlord and upon the wholesale ac­quisition of rent receiving interests in 1956, he be­came a tenant under the Government and that he never surrendered his occupancy right.<br/> <br/>7. Leave was granted to consider the question whether the learned Single Judge was well founded in law and fact in reversing the concurrent finding of the trial Court and the appellate Court that there was implied surrender of the suit land by Ram Prosad Muchi whereupon his right in the holding reverted to the landlord.<br/> <br/>8. Mr. MH Khandkar, learned counsel for the appellant in both the appeals, has raised a prelimi­nary question. He has contended that Civil Revision No. 118 of 1984 before the High Court Division was not maintainable in view of the amendment of the Civil Procedure Code under which the provision for second appeal was repealed, He pointed out that the Revisional Application under section 115 CPC against an appellate decree was subject to payment of ad valorem court fee and that a copy of the decree, by which the Appeal No. 37 of 1981 was finally dis­posed of, was to be filed along with the Revisional Application, but neither of these mandatory require­ments was complied with. The learned counsel con­tends that though it is a technical objection but the objection goes to the root of the matter and as such the objection must be given effect to. In support of this contention he has referred to a decision of the Privy Council in <em><strong>Attorney-General of the Colony of Fiji Vs. JP Bayly Ltd., 54 CWN 435.</strong></em><br/> <br/>9. There are two technical objections here, one relating to payment of ad valorem court fee upon the Revisional Application and the other relating to the non-filing of a copy of the actual decree appealed against dated 30.12.82. The learned Single judge re­ferred to the second objection in his judgment, which he called "objection of a technical nature which need not detain us long". The learned Judge took the view that the order dated 30.12.82 was merely a formality when the real decision was given in the judgment dated 21.11.82, and if that judgment were set aside, it was observed, the subsequent Judgment dated 30.12.82 would automatically fall. But as to the first objection, there was no reference to it in the judg­ment of the learned Single Judge. It is not clear whether this objection was raised before the learned Single Judge, at least in the manner it has been raised now. However, if the objection as to non­payment of ad valorem court fee is accepted by us, the result will be that the Revisional Application No. 118 of 1984 will be re-heard upon observance of these formalities. We, however, propose to go into the real question raised and see whether the appeal before us contains any substance.<br/> <br/>10. Mr. MH Khandkar has referred to the "Ijara" kabuliyat (Ext.8) of the year 1926; executed by Ram Prosad Muchi, He contends that by this kabuliyat only "ijara right" or temporary lease was created but no tenancy was created. 'Ijara', he con­tends, means a "farming lease" for a temporary peri­od without right of renewal. In support, he has re­ferred to SN Bose's Legal Dictionary. There is no dispute that an ijara right is not a tenancy right and under an "Ijara" kabuliyat no tenancy is created. But the matter may be different if the ijara right is re­newed and the Ijara holder continues in possession for an indefinite period. The Ijara in question was created in 1926 by the original owner Badsha Mia for a period of five years, on expiration of this period the Ijara-holder is found to have continued when the land was exchanged with Mohesh Saha in 1936, and even after the exchange, he is found to have continued in possession of the land for a few years more. For realisation of arrear rent Mohesh Chandra Saha filed a rent suit as appears from the papers Ext. 5 series. These papers show that Ram Prosad Muchi, the original Ijaradar was in possession of the land upto 1345 BS. corresponding to 1938-39 AD. Ap­pellant challenged Ext. 5 series as fabricated docu­ments but did not produce any evidence in support of his contention. The Ijara Kabuliyat (Ext. 8), read with the Papers—Ext. 5 series, show that though in­itially an ijara—or temporary lease—was intended, it ripened into some sort of under-tenancy because of continuous possession, and as the land was used for non-agricultural purpose e.g. as a residential hut, it was governed by the Transfer of Property Act at that time. As to whether Ram Prosad Muchi continued in possession after 1938-39 to 1949 and also thereafter till April 1956, parties came up with diametrically opposite versions. Appellant alleged that Ram Pro-sad left the place for good and established himself in a different place, Daulatganj Bazar, and lived there permanently till his death; respondent, on the other hand, alleged that Ram Prosad continued all along in the suit land till 1956 on payment of rent to the landlord and then became a tenant under the Govern­ment on wholesale acquisition of all rent receiving interests. I shall consider these two conflicting claims in due course, but now I shall see the legal position of Ram Prosad Muchi till 1938-1939.<br/> <br/>11. As indicated above, prior to the coming into force of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949, with effect from 20 October 1949, tenancy right in a non-agricultural land was governed by the Tracer of Property Act, 1982. So from 1926 to 1939 Ram Prosad Muchi's position was that of a tenant at will; his interest in the suit land was not transferable, nor heritable, nor was it capable of be­ing bequeathed. Such rights were conferred on a non-agricultural tenant, for the first time, under section 7 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act 1949; under this section certain classes of persons holding non-agricultural land by lease were given non-ejectable right. Ram Prosad Muchi, in view of his Ijara kabuliyat followed by continuous possession, might fall into one such class under section 7(4) if he had the required period of possession. That is, if Ram Prosad were to acquire these rights under this section it must be shown that he had continued in possession of the suit land for a period of twelve years prior to October, 1949. But once 1938-39, as appears, there is no reliable evidence that he possessed the land ex­cepting the rent-receipts Ext. 2 series. These rent-receipts relate to a few years preceding the year 1955-56. These rent-receipts have been seriously chal­lenged by the appellant as false and fabricated and his contention is that Ram Prosad abandoned the suit land, where he had only a dwelling hut, and perma­nently resided in Daulatganj Bazar. Respondent re­mains silent about this change of residence of Ram Prosad, but his son, PW 2 and one of the executants of the kabala Ext. 1 dated 30 March 1977, admitted that he had been residing in Daulatganj for 20-25 years as against the appellant's assertion that the family of PW 2 had been residing in Daulatpur per­manently for 25-30 years. This period, if correct, would take Ram Prosad's family to Daulatganj near about the year 1947-48. That is, if Ram Prosad had left the suit land before 1949 he did not acquire the non-ejectable right under section 7, with the result that his sons would acquire no interest in the suit land for subsequent transfer under the kabala Ext. 1. In other words, he would have no tenancy right which his sons would inherit and on the basis of which they would become tenants under the Govern­ment on wholesale acquisition of rent-receiving interest in 1956. Decisions of the then Dhaka High Court on this point have been reported in <em><strong>Nihar Ranjan Vs. Nurannessa Chowdhury, 10 DLR 472 </strong></em>and <em><strong>Delbaz Vs. Sarada Sundari Debya, 13 DLR 334</strong></em>. The Ijara lease was taken by Ram Prosad in the year 1926, but the land was transferred by his sons in 1977. There is no evidence when he died except the disputed rent-receipts, Ext. 2 series, which were al­legedly granted by Ram Prosad in the years nearing 1956. In the case of his death occurring prior to 1949 his sons inherited nothing. The rent-receipts show that the suit land was treated as an agricultural land whereas it is a non-agricultural land used for res­idential purpose only. It is these rent-receipts on which the respondent's whole case depends.<br/> <br/>12. The trial Court considered these rent-receipts but did not accept them as genuine. The ap­pellate Court, on an application by the appellant, ex­punged these rent-receipts altogether as not having been legally proved. The learned Single Judge of the High Court Division observed that such expunction of the receipts by the appellate Court was not justi­fied as these receipts were admitted without any ob­jection. Mr. Golam Rabbani, learned advocate for the respondent, has defended the views of the learned Single Judge relying upon the decision reported in the case of <em><strong>Abdullah and others Vs. Abdul Karim and others, 20 DLR (SC) 205</strong></em> as to objection to ad­mission of a document as evidence. Mr. MH Khondkar has contended that even if no objection had been taken to formal admission of these rent re­ceipts, nevertheless, the respondent (plaintiff) who had relied upon them entirely for his case was bound to prove their genuineness and that in absence of any evidence that these were genuine, the appellate Court, he argued, rightly rejected them. In support of his contention he has relied upon a decision of this Court in <em><strong>Ajufannessa Bibi Vs. Safar Miah, 30 DLR (SC) 41.</strong></em> In that case the plaintiff filed some rent re­ceipts in support of his case of settlement of a dis­puted land. It was observed by this Court:<br/> <br/>"A private document cannot be taken notice of and marked as an exhibit without any formal proof, unless the requirement of such proof is waived by the opposing party. The marking of the said document as an exhibit may however, give rise to a belief that it bears the writing or signature of a person, as has been deposed to by the witness who proves the said document. The question as to whether the document is a genu­ine one or it represents the true state of affairs is a question of fact which is to be decided by the Court concerned in the light of the facts and cir­cumstances of the case. There is no legal pre­sumption which the Court is bound to make in respect of such a document."<br/> <br/>13. The trial Court and the appellate Court did not accept these rent receipts as genuine when it was found that these were inconsistent with the fact that Ram Prosad Muchi was not there on the suit land at the relevant time but had been living in a different place permanently, whereupon it was highly improb­able that the would pay rent for a vacant land already abandoned. Besides the admission of P.W. 2, there is the evidence of PW 3, whose sons got a shop near the suit land. His evidence is that he did not see the dwelling hut of Ram Prosad in the suit land for 5-7 years. Again, if Ram Prosad had paid rent to the ex-landlord, Mohesh Chandra, upto 1956, why did he or his sons not pay rent to the Government thereafter if they became tenant under Government by operation of law. His name was not recorded in any Khatian at any time since 1926; the SA Khatian has recorded the landlord's name. On the other hand, appellant led evidence to show that upon voluntary abandonment of the suit land by Ram Prosad, the landlord re-entered the land and possessed it by growing vegeta­bles in one part and filling earth in the other part of the land. In view of his long absence from the suit land and his permanent residence in a different place the learned Subordinate Judge concluded that Ram Prosad had voluntarily abandoned the suit land never to return and that such abandonment for about 30 years constituted implied surrender. Surrender of an under-tenancy right to the landlord need not be in writing. It may be inferred from act and conduct of the parties as well. On consideration of evidence, oral and documentary, and the attending circumstanc­es, both the trial Court and the appellate Court came to a finding that Ram Prosad had surrendered the land whereupon the landlord took over its possession. This finding, based on due consideration of evidence, was beyond the scope of the revisional court to inter­fere with. Executants of the kabala Ext. 1 had no title to the land for transfer to the respondent.<br/> <br/>14. Respondent filed his suit for simple declar­ation that the appellant's kabala (Ext. la) was false and fraudulent. This declaration the plaintiff-respondent was not entitled to without first esta­blishing his title to the land. Decision of the lower appellate Court to this effect is correct.<br/> <br/>15. In the result, both the appeals are allowed.<br/> <br/>The judgments and decrees of the High Court Divi­sion are set aside and those of the lower appellate Court are restored.<br/> <br/>No order as to cost.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
