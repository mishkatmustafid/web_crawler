Ruhul Amin J:</strong>The instant appeal by the plaintiff, by leave, is against the judgment and order dated 9th December, 1992 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 2783 of 199 l(Dhaka)/Civil Revision No. 86 of 1987 (Barisal) making the Rule absolute upon setting aside the judgment and decree dated 18<sup>th</sup> May, 1986 of the Court of District Judge, Jhalakathi in Title Appeal No. 83 of 1985 so far the same relates to the property in item Nos. 1 and 2 of the ‘Ka’ schedule attached to the plaint. The learned District Judge by the aforesaid judgment and decree modified the judgment and decree dated 28th March, 1984 of the Court of Subordinate Judge, Jhalakathi in Title Suit No. 41 of 1983 by setting aside the judgment and decree passed by the learned Subordinate Judge insofar same related to the property No. 3 of the ‘Ka’ schedule attached to the plaint. The learned Subordinate Judge decreed by the aforementioned judgment and decree the suit which was for declaration of title to the three items of properties described in the ‘Ka’ schedule attached to the plaint and for recovery of khas possession thereof.  <br/> <br/>2. Plaintiff-petitioner filed the suit as reversioner of Narayan Chandra, son of Balaram Mistry whose father was Iswar Chandra.  <br/> <br/>3. Facts, in short, are that one Naba Krishna died leaving 5 sons by name, Raj Chandra, Iswar Chandra, Bindaban Chandra, Radha Krishna and Sanatan Mistry. Plaintiff is the son of Khosal Chandra whose father was Raj Chandra.  <br/> <br/>4. Iswar Chandra was the owner of 3.43 ½ acres of land. He died leaving son Balaram died leaving son Narayan Chandra and widow Beloka Sundari. Narayan Chandra died some time after the death of his father leaving his mother Beloka Sundari. Beloka Sundari thus acquired life interest in the property of Narayan Chandra.  <br/> <br/>5. It has been averred by the plaintiff that after the death of Balaram Mistry his widow Beloka Sundari was staying with Borodh Kanta Roy and that the said Borodh Kanta Roy was looking  after the properties of Beloka Sundari and was also entrusted with the payment of rent, but with intent to late grab the property of Balaram Mistry, Borodh Kanta Roy caused the rent to fall in arrear and thereupon  1.19 acres of land of Balaram was sold in auction and the same was purchased by the superior landlord and that Borodh Kanta Roy took lease of that property by a kabuliat dated 26th January, 1943 (Exhibit A (I). It is also the case of the plaintiff that Balaram’s financial condition was sound and that he did not leave any debt at the time of his death, but by making untrue statements as regard necessity of money for the purpose of repayment of debts, and to meet the expenses of offering of ‘Pinda’ and for some other purposes Borodh Kanta Roy obtained lease of 1.52 acres of land by a patta dated 24th March, 1944 (Exhibit B) executed by Beloka Sundari. It has also been averred by the plaintiff that Beloka Sundari in the absence of any necessity of money for the purpose for which in law she could make transfer of the property left by Narayan Chandra, son of Balaram Chandra had transferred 67 ½ acres of land by the kabalas dated 23rd November 1979 (Exhibit A (II) and A (III) to the defendant No. 1. It was the case of the plaintiff that transfer by Beloka Sundari of the property left by Narayan Chandra was unauthorised as because those transactions were brought in existence by the evil design of Borodh Kanta Roy and that by representing untrue facts as regard the necessity of the money in support of transfer of the property left by Narayan Chandra and that there was total absence of the cases in the presence whereof Beloka Sundari, who had limited interest in the property left by Narayan, could have transferred the same.  <br/> <br/>6. The sum total of the averments of the plaintiff in the plaint was that there was total absence of legal necessity upon showing which transfers had been made and that of the transactions two i.e. transactions relating to property Nos. 1 and 3 of ‘Ka’ schedule, have been brought into existence by the unfair activities of Borodh Kanta Roy in order to grab the property left by Narayan Chandra.  <br/> <br/>7. The suit was contested by defendant No. 1 and defendant Nos. 7-9 by filing separate sets of written statements. The case of the defendant No. 1 was that financial condition of Balaram Mistry was not sound and that Balaram prior to his death was suffering for long time from different kinds of diseases and that he died leaving debts and for repayment of debts of her husband as well as for meeting the expenses of the ‘Pindo’ offering ceremony of her husband Beloka Sundari transferred the land described in the schedule, that Beloka Sundari after the death of her husband could not come back to the position of economic solvency and that to meet the expenses of her day-to-day necessity she sold 671/2 decimals of land to him and delivered possession thereof and that he is in possession thereof. Part of the property so transferred to him by Beloka Sundari being homestead, he on the request of the elites of the village has transferred 3 decimals of land to the plaintiff in January, 1981. Property in item No. 3 was auction sold for arrears of rent and the same was purchased by superior landlord and that thereafter Borodh Kanta Roy obtained settlement of the said property, and he sold 621/2 decimals of land therefrom and delivered possession thereof. Borodh Kanta Roy died leaving 2 sons, defendant Nos. 3 and 4 and they sold 31 decimals to the defendant No. 7, Borodh Kanta Roy took pattan of the suit property in item No. 1 by the patta dated 25th March, 1944 executed by Beloka Sundari.  <br/> <br/>8. The case of defendant Nos. 7-9 is that Borodh Kanta Roy acquired title in 1.19 acres of land by virtue of settlement and that he sold 621/2 decimals of land to the defendant Nos. 8 and 9 by 2 kabalas, and that after death of Borodh Kanta Roy his 2 sons, defendant Nos. 3 and 4, sold 311/2, decimals of land to defendant No. 7 in July, 1979 and the defendants are in possession of the land since the date of their purchase.  <br/> <br/>9. The Court of first instance by the judgment and decree as mentioned hereinabove decreed the suit in entirety.  <br/> <br/>10. As against the judgment and decree of the court of first instance the defendant No. 1 went on appeal, Title Appeal No. 83 of 1985, before the Court of District Judge, Jhalakathi. The learned District Judge by the judgment and decree as stated herein before allowed the appeal in part by way of setting aside the judgment and decree of the court of first instance as regard the property in item No. 3 of the ‘Ka’ schedule and maintaining the judgment and decree of the court of first instance as regard the property in item Nos. 1 and 2 in the ‘Ka’ schedule of the plaint.  <br/> <br/>11. Thereupon, the defendant No. 1 and the plaintiff-appellant moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction. Defendant No. 1 obtained Rule in Civil Revision No. 2783 of 1991 and the plaintiff-appellant obtained Rule in Civil Revision No. 3399 of 1991. The High Court Division made the Rule absolute by the defendant No. 1 and discharged the Rule obtained by the plaintiff-appellant.  <br/> <br/>12. The plaintiff filed Civil Petitions for Leave to Appeal impugning the judgment and order of the High Court Division in the Rules. Leave was granted in the Civil Petition filed against the judgment and order in Civil Revision No. 2783 of 1991, i.e. the Civil Revision that was filed by the defendant No. 1 and that dismissed the Civil Petition filed against the judgment and order in Civil Revision No. 3399 of 1991 i.e. the Civil Revision filed by the plaintiff.  <br/> <br/>13. Leave was granted to consider the submissions that the learned Judges of the High Court Division erred in law in setting aside the concurrent findings of the courts below that Beloka Sundari had no legal necessity to transfer the property and thereupon erred in holding that Beloka Sundari had legal necessity to transfer the land in suit by the kabalas dated 23rd November, 1979 in favour of defendant No. 1 in the absence of oral evidence led by the defendants or in the absence of proof of any surrounding circumstances necessitating transfer of the property to meet the.situation in which transfer can be made by a person having limited interest, that recital in the patta Ext B dated 25th March, 1944 does not prove that Beloka Sundari transferred the land for legal necessity and that the learned Judges of the High Court Division was in error in relying upon the recital of the old patta itself without any evidence of alleged legal necessity in arriving at the finding that the transfer by the said patta was made for legal necessity.  <br/> <br/>14. It may be mentioned leave was obtained as against the judgment and order of the High Court Division relating to the property of item Nos. 1 and 2 of the ‘Ka’ schedule.  <br/> <br/>15. The submissions of the learned Advocate for the appellant centre round the question as to whether the transfers of the property of item Nos. 1 and 2 were made for any kind of legal necessity or that one of the transfers was made by Beloka Sundari being influenced by Borodh Kanta Roy and the other transfer was made being actuated by the motive of depriving the plaintiff, the reversioner of Narayan Chandra, of the property in suit.  <br/> <br/>16. The transferor of the property of item Nos. 1 and 2 as well as the transferee of the property of item No. 2 i.e. the transfers those took place in the year 1979 and 1944 respectively were dead at the time of institution of the suit on 18th January, 1981, In the background of the said matter and also the fact of passage of time it was from the practical point of the reality one of the utmost difficult situations, may impossible, on the part of the defendants who are the beneficiaries of the transfer of 1944 to establish by oral evidence the presence of the facts and the circumstances in the presence whereof Beloka Sundari, Who had the limited interest in the property of the said transaction or, in other words, the facts and circumstances recited in the document i.e. patta dated 25th March, 1944, that necessitated Beloka Sundari to alienate the said property. The patta dated 25th March, 1944 has been marked Ext B in the suit and therein it has been stated that to pay off the debts of her husband and that to meet the expenses of offering ‘Pindo’ for the salvation of the soul of her husband and that because of presence of several other reasons she having had felt necessity of money decided, to alienate the property of the said document, that is property No.1, and she alienated the property accordingly. The law is now settled that a Hindu widow having limited interest in the land of her husband, as in the instant case Beloka Sundari, widow of Balaram Mistry, who acquired limited interest in the property of Balaram, is quite competent to alienate property having limited interest to pay off the debt left by her husband and that also to meet the expenses of the religious ceremonies for the salvation of the soul of her husband. There is no dispute as to performance of religious ceremonies by Beloka Sundari for the salvation of the soul of her husband. In the instant case in Ext B there is mention of necessities for which Beloka Sundari felt necessity of cash money and that to obtain the cash money transferred the property of the Exhibit B, the patta dated 25th March, 1944. The facts mentioned in the Exhibit B are by now the accepted facts in the presence whereof a widow is legally authorised to transfer the property wherein she has limited interest.  <br/> <br/>17. It is the case of plaintiff-appellant that Balaram. husband of Beloka Sundari, died at a time while his financial condition was sound and that at the time of his death he left no debt and that he left sufficient wealth for meeting the expenses of religious ceremonies seeking salvation of the soul of Balaram and that after the death of Balaram his widow, Beloka Sundari, was never in economic distress compelling her to alienate the property left by Balaram. The plaintiff-appellant to establish his aforesaid contention has examined himself as PW 1 and PW 2, PW 3 (whose evidence partly relates to the property in item Nos. 1 and 2) and PW 4. The learned Counsel for the appellant upon placing the evidence of the said witnesses submitted that the plaintiff sufficiently established absence of the circumstances or matters for which transfers were made by Beloka Sundari by the Exhibit B and that by the Exhibit A (II) and A(III) relating to property Nos. 1 and 2 respectively. As against the evidence brought on record by the plaintiff to disprove the presence of condition recited in the documents in question defendants have relied on the recitals of the said documents.<br/> <br/>18. The undisputed position is that the transfer by Ext B is being challenged not only after the death of the parties to the said document and that also after lapse of about 37 years. The plaintiff although has examined the aforementioned witnesses to establish the absence of the matters and circumstances necessitating transfer, but the evidence of the said witnesses is not of that level or kind to consider reliable for totally leaving aside the recitals in the document of about 37 years old. Had said document been challenged in the recent years of the transaction or at a time which is not as long as in the instant case and that had the transaction being not challenged after the death of the parties to the document it would have been possible for the parties to the document and that also for the beneficiaries under the document to establish the recital relating to necessities stated in the document by calling them and that also other persons of the relevant time, but because of the lapse of time calling of the persons of the relevant time to depose about the fact stated in the document has become impossible as well as because of the death of the parties to the document. It has already been stated that the evidence of the persons who have been called by the appellant as the persons contemporaneous with the period of the exhibit B are not of that quality for totally discarding the statement of fact made sufficiently long back. In such situation the courts have placed reliance on the recital in the document in question in making its decision as to genuineness of the transaction made in the background of the circumstances and the facts stated in the document. In a case, facts and circumstances whereof are more or less close to the instant one, reported in <strong><em>AIR 1916 (PC) 110</em></strong> it has been observed;<br/> <br/>“In general terms the facts recited would establish the necessity alleged, but it is well established that such recitals cannot by themselves be relied upon for the purpose of proving the assertions of facts which they contain. Indeed, it is obvious that if such proof were permitted the rights of reversionary could always be defeated by the insertion of carefully prepared recitals. Under ordinary circumstances and apart from statute, recitals in deeds can only be evidence as between the parties to the conveyance and those who claim under them.”  <br/> <br/>“If the deeds were challenged at the time or near the date of their execution, so that independent evidence would be available, the recitals would deserve but slight consideration, and certainly should not be accepted as proof of the facts. But, as time goes by, and all the original parties to the transaction and all those who could have given evidence on the relevant points have grown old or passed away, a recital consistent with the probability and circumstances of the case, assumes greater importance, and cannot lightly be set aside; for it should be remembered that the actual proof of the necessity which justified the deed is not essential to establish its validity. It is only necessary that a representation should have been made to the purchaser that such necessity existed and that he should have acted honestly and made proper enquiry to satisfy himself of its truth. The recital is clear evidence of the representation, and, if the circumstances are such as to justify a reasonable belief that an enquiry would have confirmed its truth, then when proof of actual enquiry has become impossible, the recital, coupled with such circumstances, would be sufficient evidence to support the deed. To hold otherwise would result in deciding that a title becomes weaker as it grows older, so that a transaction-perfectly honest and legitimate when it took place— would ultimately be incapable of justification merely owing to the passage of time.<br/> <br/>19. The facts and circumstances present whereof, as are in the aforesaid observation, recited in the document of sufficiently older period can be considered as the clear evidence of the representation and that of enquiry for establishing truth of representation has become impossible, as in the instant case, the High Court Division was quite correct in taking the recital in the document in question as the sufficient evidence as to the genuineness of the transaction.  <br/> <br/>20. As regard the transaction that took place on 23rd November, 1979 by Exhibit A (II) and A (III) there is absence of specific kind of necessity forcing Beloka Sundari to make the transfers. In the said Exhibits (A-II and A-III) only a statement of general nature has been made as to requirement of cash money. The transfers by the Exhibits A-II and A-III from the standpoint of year of institution of Suit were of recent time. The defendant No. 1 has not taken step to establish by calling the persons contemporaneous with the period of transactions by Exhibits A-II and A-III, which were of recent time that at the time when the transactions were made there were the presence of legally recognised necessities that forced Beloka Sundari to transfer the land of the said two documents. The said defendant as seen from the materials on record, has not called the persons, although the vendor was dead, of the time of transaction because of the transactions in question being of recent time to establish what were the surrounding circumstances at the relevant time that forced Beloka Sundari who had limited interest in the land so transferred to go for the transfers on 23rd November, 1979. It was the duty of the defendant No. 1 to establish the fact or facts that compelled Beloka Sundari to transfer the land by the Exhibit A (II) and A (III) for sustaining the transactions in his favour or in other words that there were presence of facts and circumstances legally permitting a widow, like Beloka Sundari, having had limited interest in the property so transferred to make the transfers on 23<sup>rd</sup> November, 1979.  <br/> <br/>21. Mr. Mahbubey Alam, learned Advocate for the appellant, has referred to the decisions reported in <strong><em>21 DLR 673</em></strong> and<em> <strong>29 DLR 7</strong></em> in support of his submission that recital in the document by itself does not establish the facts of legal necessity and that by calling the persons of that time of transaction facts stated in the deed are to be established. The facts of the said two cases are quite distinct of the instant one and that in the said reported cases suits challenging the transfers were filed within the short span of time from the date of transfer. The submission of the learned Advocate for the appellant that correctness of recital in the document is to be established by calling the persons of time of transaction would be quite correct in respect of a case where transfer is challenged  within reasonable span of time when there is probability of availability of persons of the time of transfer, but in a case, as in the instant one transaction by Exhibit B where transfer is challenged after lapse of considerable long time then recital in the document  being of long past can legally be considered in the light of observation in the case reported in <strong><em>AIR 1916 PC 110</em></strong>, genuine and the court may taking the recital along with the circumstances go for making its decision as to validity of the deed.  <br/> <br/>In the light of the discussion made herein above the appeal succeeds in part. The judgment and Order dated 9th December 1992 in Civil Revision No.2783 of 1991 (Dhaka) insofar the same relates to property No. 2 i.e. transfer by kabalas dated 23rd November, 1979 (Exhibits A-II and A-III) is set aside and that the judgment and order relating to property No. 1 i.e., property transferred by patta dated 25th March, 1944 (Exhibit B) by Beloka Sundari, is affirmed. The plaintiff-appellant’s suit is decreed only in respect of property No. 2 and that his suit in respect of the property Nos. 1 and 3 stands dismissed.  <br/> <br/>There is no order as to costs.  <br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
