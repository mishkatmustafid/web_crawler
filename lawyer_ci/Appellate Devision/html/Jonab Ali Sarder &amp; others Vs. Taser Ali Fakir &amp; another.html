Plaintiffs' case, in short, was that the suit land i.e. 1/3rd of C.S. plot No. 839, 832, 842, 867 and 869 and half of C.S. No. 797 and whole of other plots appertaining to jama of Rs. 7/- belonged to Ichhamoyee Dashi who sold the same to Abdul Mannan and pro-forma defendant No. 6 by kabala dated 28.2.36 in equal shares. Abdul Mannan sold his entire interest i.e. -/8/- annas share of the jama to the plaintiff by kabala dated 7.9.57. Pro forma defendant No. 6 Jabed Mondal also sold some portion of the share of the jama to the plaintiff. The plaintiff and pro forma defendant No. 6 were threatened dispossession and as such they filed Title Suit No. 205 of 1958. The suit ended in compromise by the said compromise decree. The plaintiff and pro forma defendant No. 6 got 1/3rd share of the suit dag i.e. the suit land. The defen­dants 1 to 5 who were pro forma defendants Nos. 30 to 34 in that suit got the remaining portion of the suit plot. Thereafter pro forma defendant No. 6 sold his remaining share in the plot to the plaintiff and the plaintiff and the became owner of 16 annas share of the suit land and since then he was in possession of the same asserting his own right. In the recent rent roll plaintiff's name was not cor­rectly recorded and being encouraged by the finding of a case under section 19(1) and 19(2) of the East Bengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Act the defendants threatened the plaintiff with dispossession from the suit land. Hence the suit.<br/> <br/>3. The defendants 1 to 5 contended, inter alia, that in terms of solenama filed in Title Suit No. 205 of 1958 plaintiff got 1/3rd share of the suit land of that suit except plot No. 797 in which the plaintiff got half share. The remaining portions of the suit land of that suit in the allotment of the defendants and as such according to the defendants, the plaintiff was not entitled to get any relief whatsoever in the suit. The trial Court came to the conclusion that on the interpretation of the Solenama Ext. 2 plaintiff was entitled to 1/3rd of the suit dag and not of the suit land. In that view of the matter plaintiff's suit was decreed.<br/>The appellate Court below concurred with the findings of the trial Court and dismissed the appeal preferred by defendant’s No. 1 to 5.<br/> <br/>4. In Second Appeal being S.A. No. 619 of 1962 the learned Single Judge allowed the appeal and set aside the judgments and decrees of the Courts below and decreed the suit in part holding that a decree be passed in favour of the plaintiff for 1/3rd of the land of the plots 832, 839, 842, 867,869 and half of the C.S. plot No. 797 in respect of the quantum of land which were the subject matter of the suit No. 205 of 1958.<br/> <br/>5. Leave was granted for filing a Letters Patent Appeal and the High Court Division in Letters Patent Appeal came to the conclu­sion that crucial point of interpretation of Ext. 2   Solenama. Learned Judgment consi­dered the Solenama Ext. 2 and concluded that the compromise was effected with regard to the land of the decree and not with regard to the land in suit In Letters Patent Ap­peal it was noticed that the trial Court and the appellate Court below correctly construed the Solenama that in that compromise the entire land of dags were divided into 1/3rd and 2/3rd between the parties and the plain­tiff will gel 1/3rd   and defendant will get 2/3rd of the dags in the suit. The learned Single Judge on the other hand held that the Solenama mentioned the expression “nalishi jami” (land in the suit) which means the lands were subject matter of the suit and whole of the dags were not the subject matter of the suit. In Letters Patent Appeal it was observed: <br/> <br/>''Though the whole dags were not the subject matter of the suit the plaintiff claimed in that suit by compromise the said dags were divided among the parties which was quite legal and it cannot be said that only the lands of the suit were divided".  <br/> <br/>It was also noticed that the parties in the previous suit and the present suit were the same and in that context it was viewed that the entire dags was subject matter of the compromise. The learned Judges pointedly mentioned: "It is compromised between the parties claiming title to the suit dags and in that compromise the whole dags have been divided between the parties". It was further found that the compromise was given effect to by the Courts. In this view of the matter the judgment and order of the learned Single Judge in Second Appeal was set aside and those of the trial Court and the first appellate Court were restored.<br/> <br/>Leave was granted to consider the legal effect of Ext. 2 Solenama.<br/> <br/>6. Mr. M.H. Khondker appearing for the defendants appellants contended that Ext. 2 did not divide the whole dags and even if it had purported to be done it was inad­missible evidence not being registered as it compromised property outside suit inasmuch as such solenama is compulsorily registerable under section 17(1) (b of the Registration Act. The entire document has been placed before us and on reading of the Solenama we are of the view that the High Court Division in Letters Patent had correctly interpreted the document and rightly restored those of the trial and the lower appellate Court below. The expression "Nalishi jami ” created the confusion but reading the solenama as a whole there is no doubt that the entire dags of the parties were divided as the terms of the compromise. The interpretation of the Ext. 2 is concluded by the concurrent find­ings of the facts of the courts below and the learned Single Judge in Second Appeal ought not to have disturbed those findings only on the assuming meaning of expression namely ''Nalishi jami ‘‘ (Land in the suit) which has now paved the way for controversy. The contention grounded on the admissibility of the docu­ment has no force, section 17, no doubt postulates that certain document must be registered but sub-section (2) provides that nothing in clause (b) and (c) of sub-section (1) applies to any decree or order of a court (except a decree or order expressed to be made on a compromise and comprising immo­vable property other than that which is the subject matter of the suit or proceeding.) Clause 9 was amended in 1929 following a decision of Privy Council in Hemendra Kumari vs. Middnapur Zamindary,  A.I.R. 1919 P.C. 79. After the amendment the position appears to be this: If the case of compromise relates to property which is not the subject matter of the suit or proceeding then obviously latter part of Clause 6 would take away the exce­ption and to such a case clause (b) or (c) as the case may be would apply, and such a document would be liable for registration. Where the compromise deals only with the properties in the suit and the Court passes a decree in accordance therewith, such a case will fall within the exception and such a decree would not require registration, the words "and not being decree and order" in section 50 obviously refer to decrees and orders which are exempted from registration under the amended section 17(2) (vi). It is a question of fact whether the compromise has been acted upon or is covered by a decree which is a mixed question. If the com­promise has been acted upon or is covered by decree then it is settled law that com­promise is exempt from registration.<br/> <br/>7. Mr. Khondker could not assail the point that the compromise had been acted upon. Solenama was given effect to and cons­truction of the solenama by the two courts below clearly shows that the entire dags were subject matter of the compromise. Therefore clause 6 covers the case and the document is exempt from registration. The argument built on sub-section (1) of section 17 does not stand.<br/> <br/>In the result this appeal is dismissed.<br/> <br/>No costs.<br/> <br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
