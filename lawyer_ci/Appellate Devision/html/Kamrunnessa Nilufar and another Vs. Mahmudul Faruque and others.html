Joynul Abedin J</strong>This petition for leave to appeal at the instance of the plaintiffs is directed against the judgment and order dated 1-10-2007 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in First Miscellaneous Appeal No. 258 of 2007 dismissing the appeal.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong> The short fact is that the petitioners as plaintiff filed the said Title Suit No. 217 of 2006 against the defendant respondents claiming a saham of 1/5 share in schedule 'Ka' land and for declaration that three registered documents, one being a bainapatra fully described in schedule 'Kha' and two kabala deeds as fully described in schedule 'Ga' to the plaint, are all illegal, collusive and not binding on them and also for khas possession of their saham alleging, inter alia, that their mother Abeda Khatun alias Waleda Khatun purchased the schedule 'Ka' land on 28-4-1952 by registered Deed No. 2981 and during SA Survey it was recorded in her name in SA Plot No. 254 under SA Khatian No. 186 and the same has also been recorded in RS Plot No. 415 under the RS Khatian No. 171. The said Abeda Khatun constructed a three-storied building on the said land known as No. 1/A, Fakirapool, DIT Extension Road. While she was enjoying peaceful right, title and pos­session in the said land she died leaving behind 3(three) sons, i.e., the defendant Nos.1-3 and four daughters i.e., the two plaintiffs and the defendant Nos. 6-7. In place of their mother all her sons and daughters have been enjoying the ejmali right, title and possession of the same through the tenants and the defendant No. 1, the eldest brother of the plaintiffs was entrust­ed with the management of the same which he would discharge through the appointed Mana­ger and they would share the rent according to their respective shares. The plaintiffs thereafter demanded partition by metes and bounds for several times lastly on 30-6-2006 but the defen­dants refused. On the contrary the plaintiffs found that the defendants in collaboration with each other made some fraudulent paper tran­sactions in favour of the defendant No. 4 with a view to depriving them from their inheritance.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> Thereafter on 12-9-2006, the plaintiffs filed an application for temporary injunction restraining the defendant No. 5 from collecting rent to the extent of 1/5 share from the tenants and also from disturbing the plaintiffs from collecting rent from the tenants to the extent of their 1/5 share and from changing nature and character of the ejmali property by demolishing partly or fully the three-storied building cons­tructed by their mother and of causing damage to the building which is occupied by the tenants.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> The defendants contested the applica­tion for temporary injunction by filing a written objection contending, inter alia, that they has purchased the suit property from respondent Nos.1-3 by two separate kabalas. They acquired the property by virtue of oral gift made by their mother, the predecessor who in support of this gift has sworn an affidavit on 30-6-1987 before a Notary Public, Bangladesh. Accordingly, the property was not in ejmali possession nor the petitioners have any title to it.  Respondent Nos.1-3 got their names mutated by paying rents and subsequently respondent No. 5 also mutated his name in government sheristas and he kept the property in mortgage to Jamuna Bank, Dilkusha, Dhaka and took loan which is being invested in his business and, as such, the application for temporary injunction may be rejected with cost.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> The said application for temporary injunction was heard and rejected by the learned Joint District Judge, 5th Court, Dhaka by judgment and order dated 15-3-2007.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the aforesaid judgment and order dated 15-3-2007, the plaintiff-petitioners filed First Miscel­laneous Appeal No. 258 of 2007 in the High Court Division. The High Court Division after hearing dismissed the appeal by the impugned judgment and order dated 1-10-2007. Hence the present petition for leave to appeal by the plaintiff-petitioners.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> Mr. Khurshid Alam Khan, the learned Advocate for the petitioners, submits that the Courts below have failed to appreciate that the facts and circumstances obtaining in the case leads one to the irresistible conclusion that the plaintiff petitioners are rightful co-sharers in the property in question and that their brothers defendant Nos.1-3 by collusion with defendant Nos. 4 and 5 managed to execute and register the fraudulent Bainapatra wherein the property for sale was claimed to be inherited from the mother but in kabalas claiming the same to be acquired by gift made by mother of defendant Nos.1-3 and, as such the plaintiff needed pro­tection of this Court in order to keep their interest in the property from being jeopardised. He lastly, submits that "the legal conse­quence"/incident of the said affidavit dated 30-6-1987 sworn by Abida Khatun before the Notary Public, Bangladesh, if considered in juxtaposition with the "Muslim Law of Inheri­tance," the High Court Division or the learned Joint District Judge ought to have found that the petitioners are in ejmali possession of the suit property warranting order of temporary injunction.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> We have heard the learned Advocate and perused the connected papers including the impugned judgment. We do not find any substance in the points raised. The High Court Division upon correct assessment of the mate­rials on record arrived at a correct decision and dismissed the appeal. We therefore, find no reason to interfere with the same.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
