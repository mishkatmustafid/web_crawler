Fazlul Haque J:</strong>This appeal at the instance of the plaintiff arises out of the judg­ment and order dated 26.4.1995 passed by the Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 914 of 1987 making the Rule absolute and reversing the judgment and decree dated 8.7.1987 of the learned Additional District judge, Bagerhat passed in Title Appeal No.181 of 1984 decreeing the suit and revers­ing the judgment and decree dated 7.2.1983 passed by the learned Assistant Judge, Bagerhat in Title Suit No. 396 of 1975 dismissing the Suit.<br/> <br/>2. Rakhal Chandra Pal as plaintiff filed Title Suit No. 396 of 1975 in the 1<sup>st</sup> Court of Munsif, Bagerhat against the respondent No. 1 for declaration of title to the suit land along with huts thereon and for khas possession there­of.<br/> <br/>3. The Case of the plaintiff, in short, is that 30 decimals of land of S.A. Khatian No. 16 cor­responding to C.S. Khatian No.116 of Mouza Bashabati belonged to Gobinda Bairagi under landlord Ambika Charan, Gobinda Bairagi died about 30-40 years back, (Gobinda Baragi died unmarried leaving no heir), landlord Ambika Charan made the suit land khas and took it under his own possession. After the death of Ambika Charn his son Minindra Nath, in the year of 1359 B.S. Settled the suit land orally to the plaintiff Rakhal Chandra Pal. Manindra Nath filed Rent suit No.150 of 1956 wherein tie admitted the present plaintiff as his tenant. On payment of arrear rents the suit was dismissed. The plaintiff had been in possession of the suit land having the Golpata hut on it on 19.4.73 the defendant No.1 dispossessed the plaintiff, hence the suit was filed.<br/> <br/>4. The defendant No.1 contested the suit by filing a written statement and contended, inter alia, that Gobinda Bairagi had although in pas­sion of the suit land. He was married and dies leaving only one son and heir Bishweshwar Bairagi, who sold the said land to the defendant No.1 by kabala dated 10.8.1972 and delivered possession of the suit land to him. The defen­dant No.1 is in possession of the suit land by constructing huts on approved plan from Municipality. Plaintiff's allegation of making the suit land khas by Ambika Charan, the supe­rior owner and settling the land orally by Monindra, Son of Amibka to the plaintiff is absolutely false and the plaintiff never pos­sessed the suit land. The defendant No.1 further contended that the allegation of dispossession by him is also false.<br/> <br/>5. The trial Court dismissed the suit disbe­lieving the case of the plaintiff that he had taken oral settlement of the land from Monindra Charan after making the suit land khas by supe­rior landlord and delivered possession the plain­tiff and dispossession from the suit land by the defendant No. 1. The trial court has believed that Gobinda Bairagi left his son, Blshashwar as his heir and that Bishashwar legally transferred the suit land to the defendant No.1. Further, the trial court has held that tenancy of Gobinda Bairagi was not terminated legally and as such alleged settlement of suit land orally to the plaintiff is illegal. It appears that the appellate court believed the possession of the plaintiff, who was allegedly dispossessed by the defen­dant No. 1 Further appellate court has held that the appellate court believed the possession of the plaintiff, who was allegedly dispossessed by the defendant No.1 Further appellate court has held that Gobinda Bairagi abandoned his rayoti right and then the landlord Ambika legally made the suit land khas, and his son Monindra settled the suit land orally to the plaintiff after the death of Ambika. The appellate court has relied on two documents, namely, a certificate from the local Chairman marked Ext. X and the voter list of the locality, which were filed for the first time before the appellate court and found that Gobinda Bairagi was unmarried and Bisheshwar was not his son. The High Court Division with regard to the aforesaid two docu­ments has held that these two documents were not legally considered by the appellate Court as the same were not proved in accordance with law and the same were not admitted as addi­tional evidence in compliance with the provi­sion of order 41, Rule 27 of the Code of Civil procedure, yet the appellate court on the basis of those two documents has held that Gobinda Bairagi was unmarried and Bishashwar was not his son. The High Court Division has held that the finding on the basis of that evidence is wrong because the said documents were not legally proved. Further, the High Court Division has held that the superior landlord could make the land of a rayoit khash and could take it under his own possession only in compli­ance of the provision of section 87(1) (2) of the Bengal Tenancy Act but the same was not done in the present case. Sub-sections 1 and 2 of Section 87 of B.T. Act are as under:-<br/> <br/>"<strong>87.</strong> (1) if a raiyat or under raiyat volun­tarily abandons his residence without notice to his landlord and without arranging for payment his rent as it falls due, and cases to cultivate his holding either by himself or by some other per­son, the landlord may, at any time after the expiration of the agricultural year in which the raiyat or under raiyat so abandons and ceases to cultivate, enter on the holding and let it to another ten­ant or take it into cultivation himself.<br/>(2) Before a landlord enters under this section, he shall file a notice in the pre­scribed form in the collectors office, stating that he has treated the holding as abandoned and is about to enter on it accordingly; and the Collector shall a cause notice to be published in the pre­scribed manner." <br/> <br/>6. The learned Advocate has also cited <strong><em>12 DLR 266 (Saifuddin Kazi alias SafiruddinVs. Moslem Ali Howlader and others)</em></strong> wherein it has been held, <em>inter alia</em>, Sub-section (2) of Section 87 B.T. Act expressly provides that, although in the case of voluntary abandonment of residence, the landlord may enter on the holding and let it out to another tenant or take it into cultivation under himself, yet before he does that, he must file a notice in the prescribed from in the collectors office saying that he has treated the holdings as abandoned and is about to enter on it accordingly, and the collector shall cause the notice to be published in the pre­scribed manner.<br/> <br/>In the same decision it has further been held:-<br/> <br/>"The Bengal Tenancy Act has not given any definition of the word 'abandon­ment'. But it connotes the idea of a ten­ant vacating the land with the intention of never returning to it. Mere tempo­rary absence or absence in circum­stances which cannot lead to the infer­ence that the tenant had departed from the land without caring as to what hap­pens thereto, this is not sufficient to warrant the inference of abandonment. It was, therefore, necessary to see some more positive acts than mere non-residence to establish abandonment." <br/> <br/>7. On the basis of the aforesaid provision of law the High Court Division has found that alleged abandonment of the suit land by its ten­ant Gobinda Bairagi could not be established by the plaintiff and making it khash by the landlord in accordance with law. S. A. Khatian admitted­ly was prepared in the name of Gobinda Bairagi, therefore, it supports that Gobinda Bairagi did not abandon the suit property and the High Court Division did not believe the contention of the plaintiff that landlord made the land khash and took it under his own pos­session. Further, the High Court Division has held that address of Gobinda Bairagi at 24 Parganas of West Bengal in the S.A. Khatian cannot take away his right from the suit property, as abandonment by him could not be established. Record of rights in the case reflects the correct state of affairs and reliance has been placed by the High Court Division in decision reported <strong><em>9 DLR 467</em>.</strong><br/> <br/>8. The claim of the plaintiff that he took oral settlement of the suit land. The High Court Division has held that termination of tenancy of Gobinda Bairagi was not made legally. Therefore, whether the settlement was made orally or not is of little significance. In fact, it has no value in the eye of law. Further, the High Court Division has held that proceedings or Rent Suit No. 150 of 1959 has also no impact upon the claim of the plaintiff since it did not reach finality. The High Court Division has held that the defendant admittedly is in possession of the suit land having his huts and homestead on it, It has been held in the case of <strong><em>Lal Miah vs. Hazi Md. Ibrahim</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>28 DLR (AD) 61</em></strong> that:- <br/> <br/>"It well settled that when a defendant is in possession he could be evicted only by a person having a better title over suit land." <br/> <br/>9. Further, the High Court Division has held that correctness and genuineness of the deed of purchase of the defendant can be presumed rightly under section 114(e) of the Evidence Act and the plaintiff has failed to rebut the same.<br/> <br/>10. Before the High Court Division plain­tiff-opposite party referred to the decision reported in <strong><em>1 DLR (PC) 5, Hurbert James Vs. Golam  Hossain  Akeema</em></strong>. The High Court Division found that the said decision is not applicable in the present case because the same does not tally either in spirit of facts. Further, the learned Advocate for the appellant submit­ted that the appellant filed a Criminal Case against the respondent for disturbing his posses­sion under Section 424/448 which proved appellant's possession in the suit land.  It appears that the said Criminal Cass was with­drawn. Therefore, the said case has not bearing upon the decision of the present case. Further, it has been held in the case reported in <strong><em>3 BLD (AD) 334</em></strong> that finding of Criminal Courts is not binding on the Civil Courts. The High Court Division has gone to say that the important thing in this case is that the defendant is in pos­session of the suit land and constructed home­stead on the basis of the approved plan from the Municipality and unless the plaintiff can prove better title he cannot get a decree for declaration of his title and for khas possession. The High Court Division has held that the appellate court upon mis-reading and non-reading of the evidence on record found the possession in favor of the plaintiff and also found that the defendant had dispossessed him. The High Court Division further accepted the view of the trial Court wherein it has been found that since the termi­nation of tenancy of Gobinda Bairagi by his landlord Ambika Charan could not be proved to have been made in accordance with law the plaintiff's title of he suit land falls like pack of cards having no evidentiary value, Further, the High Court Division has held that the plaintiff can only succeed on the material of his own cause and he cannot get a decree on the weak­ness or failure of the defendants. This view gets support from the decision in the case of <strong><em>Naimuddin Sarder Vs. Abul Kalam</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>39 DLR (AD) 237</em></strong>.<br/> <br/>11. For the aforesaid reasons the High Court Division has interfered with the judgment and decree of the appellate court which is not sustainable in law, and the Rule was made absolute. The judgment and decree of the appel­late court has been set aside and those of the trial court are restored. The plaintiff's suit has been dismissed.<br/> <br/>12. The plaintiff being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and order passed by   the High Court Division moved this Court and obtained the leave mainly on the grounds that the High Court Division failed to consider prop­erly Ext. 2, suit register of Rent Suit No. 150 of 1956 which proves that landlord Manindra admitted Rakhal as the korfa tenant of the suit land by filing the said rent suit and also Ext.3, the enquiry report of the local Tashilder, in Miscellaneous Case No. 32 of 1968-98 under section 143  of the  State  Acquisition  and Tenancy Act of 1950, and Ext. 6 an order of the local circle officer (revenue), for mutating the name of Rakhal on the basis of Ext.3. Further, the High Court Division ought not to have reversed the finding of facts arrived at by the lower appellate Court as to the possession of the parties in the suit land.<br/> <br/>13. Plaintiff's Case, in short, is that Gobinda Bairagi died unmarried leaving no heirs, that the landlord took the suit land into his own possession and subsequently, landlord died leaving a son Monindra, who gave oral settlement thereof to Rakhal Chandra, and that the principal defendant dispossessed Rakhal Chandra by Creating a false sale deed.<br/> <br/>14. Case of the principal defendant No.1 is that the said deed is not a false one and that Gobinda Bairagi died leaving a son, Bishweshar Bairagi, who subsequently sold the suit land to the principal defendant No. 1 by the said sale deed in question dated 18.10.1997. The trial Court dismissed the suit. But in appeal the lower appellate Court decreed the suit. Then the principal defendant No.1 obtained Rule in Civil Revision No. 914 of 1987 from the High Court Division, who by the judgment and order dated 26.4.1995 made the Rule absolute and restored the Judgment and decree passed by the trial Court.<br/> <br/>15. It appears that the plaintiff's claim is that he took oral settlement of the suit land from Monindra but the plaintiff has failed to adduce any paper with regard to the settlement although he has stated that he lost the papers during the liberation war. The basis of alleged oral settlement has not been substantiated by the plaintiff. Further, the Gobinda Bairagi was admittedly the tenant under the landlord Ambika, who did not take the suit land from the aforesaid Gobinda Bairagi legally who could take it under his possession only in compliance of section 87(1) (2) of the Bengal Tenancy Act. Therefore, the alleged claim of the plaintiff of no substance since the Gobinda Bairagi never abandoned the suit land and the landlord never took the land in compliance with Section 87(1) &amp; (2) of B.T. Act.<br/> <br/>16. There is no doubt that the plaintiff has to prove his own case in order to get the decree in his favour. The plaintiff appellant having failed to substantiate his case of oral settlement by evidence is not entitled to get the decree as prayed for. It has been held in the case of <strong><em>Naimuddin Sarder Vs. Abul Kalam</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>39 DLR (AD) 237</em></strong> that the plaintiff cannot get the decree on the weakness or failure of the defendants to prove his defence. Further, if also appears that S.A. Khatian admittedly stands in the name of Gobinda Bairagi; therefore, it sup­ports the case of the defendant that Gobinda Bairagi did not abandon the suit property and it belies the contention of the plaintiff that land­lord made the land khas and took under his own possession; proceeding of Rent Suit No. 150 of 1959 has also no impact upon the claim of the plaintiff since it did not reach finality. The appellate Court relying on two documents, namely, a certificate from the local Chairman marked Ext. X and the voter list of the locality, which was filed before the appellate Court and found that Gobinda Bairagi was unmarried and Bisheshwar was not his son. The said two doc­uments were not legally proved before the Court in accordance with the provision of order 41, Rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The question of acceptance of the same and the find­ing on the basis of those documents that Gobinda Bairagi was unmarried and Bisheswar was not his son, is not at all legally Correct. Therefore, the High Court Division has correct­ly reversed the finding of the trial court since it is contrary to evidence on record. The finding is based on inadmissible evidence.<br/> <br/>17. Since the plaintiff failed to prove the question of settlement in his favour and since the landlord did not take the suit land in compli­ance with the provision of section 87(1) of the B.T. Act, the question of finding of possession in favor of the plaintiff does not arise. Gobinda Bairagi was the tenant under superior landlord Ambika Charan and the plaintiff has failed to dismantle the case of Gobinda Bairagi.<br/> <br/>18. The High Court Division has correctly interfered with the judgment and decree of the appellate court; since the plaintiff has felled to prove his case, he is not entitled to decree as prayed for. The High Court Division has right­ly reversed the judgment passed by the appel­late Court, and restored those of the trial Court.<br/> <br/>19. The judgment and order passed by the High Court Division is an elaborate and speaking one, and we are not inclined to interfere with the same.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with­out any order as to costs.<br/> <br/>The suit has rightly been dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
