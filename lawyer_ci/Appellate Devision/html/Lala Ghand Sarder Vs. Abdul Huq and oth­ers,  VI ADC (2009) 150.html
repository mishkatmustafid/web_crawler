The facts of the case are that respondent Nos.1 and 2 filed the Miscellaneous Case No. 46 of 1984 for pre-emption in respective of 164 acres of land. Their case is that they are co-sharers in the properties of schedule Nos. 1 and 2 as heirs of their father and contiguous owners of schedule No. 3 property as heirs of their father who is owner of plot Nos. 94, 95, 96, 104, 101 and 102, purchased the said 1.46 acres of land from the vendor respondent No. 3 by registered sale deed dated 04.08.1983 at a consideration of Tk. 2000.00. After coming to know about the sale the respondent No. 2 filed the case on deposit of the consideration with statutory compensation.<br/> <br/>3. The petitioner contested the case by filing a "written objection denying the material allegation stating, <em>inter alia,</em> that the case holdings recorded in R.S. Khatian Nos. 47, 31 and 153 in the names of Haralal Ghose, Priollal Ghose, Jatindra Lal Ghose and Surendra Lal Ghose who entered into an agreement with the petitioner on 27.02.1965 to sell their 8 annas share of the said property of the said holding; that they having failed to amicably settle to execute and register the kabala in favour of the peti­tioner, the petitioner filed Title Suit No. 232 of 1970 in the Court of Madaripur for Specific Performance of contract and the suit was decreed up to the appellate Court and accordingly, the petitioner obtained a registered kabala in execution of the said decree, that father of the pre-emptors did not get any land in these case holding by his alleged purchase and as such, the pre-emptor respondents were not co-sharers in the said holdings of property Nos.1 and 2; that the petitioner improved the case land by cutting earth worth Tk.10,000.00 and constructed huts, raise garden and residing there; that the pres­ent value of the case land would be Tk. 50,000.00 so the case was not main­tainable without depositing of increased value of the land and costs of improve­ment and the trial Court by judgment and order dated 28.11.1985 allowed the pre-emption in respect of property Nos.1 and 2 and disallowed the prayer for pre-emption against the property No.3.<br/> <br/>4. Md. Aftab Hossain, learned Advocate-on-Record, appearing for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner purchased the landed property in suit on the basis of an agreement for sale on 27.02.1965 and got it registered through Court by the decree in the suit for Specific Performance of Contract and the petitioner entered into posses­sion of the suit land, made improve­ment of the land by earth work thereby he has spent more than fifty thousand and planted fruit bearing trees and other trees on the suit land at a cost of Tk. 10,000.00 more than 30 years ago; nor the trees have been grown up and value of the trees have been increased much which has not been considered by the High Court Division; that the case hold­ing recorded in R. S. Khatian Nos. 47, 31 and 153 in the names of Haralal Ghose, Priolal Ghose and Jatindra Lal Ghose and Surendra Lal Ghose who entered into an agreement with the petitioner on 27.02.1965 to sell their landed proper­ties of the said holding in favour of the petitioner; they having failed to amica­ble execute and register the kabala in favour of the petitioner; he filed Title Suit No. 232 of 1970 in the Court of Madaripur for Specific Performance of Contract and the suit was decreed up to the appellate Court and accordingly the petitioner obtained a registered kabala in execution of the said decree through Court after 18 years on 04.08.1983 and as such it merits consideration whether such kabala comes within the mischief of the presumption. The learned Advocate further submitted that in the review petition no materials were produced showing that the petitioner is a co-sharer by inheritance and owning and possessing contiguous land in the suit and as such, the High Court Division without considering this aspect of the case has discharged the Rule illegally occasioning failure of justice.<br/> <br/>5. It appears from the record that the Court of Appeal below on consideration of kabalas dated 04.07,1972 and 25.07.1972 found that preemptor's father Ashu Howlader became co-shar­er in the holdings of the suit property Nos.1 and 2. On consideration of kabalas dated 18.02.1963 Court of Appeal below found that pre-emptor's father purchased lands of plot No. 94, 95 and 96. By kabala dated 02.02.1962 pre-emptor No.1 purchased land of plot No. 104 and by Kabala dated 27.0 1.1962 pre-emptor's father purchased another portion of the said plot No. 104 and by kabala dated 23.06.1970 pre-emptor's father purchased land of plot No.104 and 102. On consideration of the mouza map Court of Appeal below came to the conclusion that the lands of Plot Nos. 94, 95, 96, 101 and 104 are contiguous to the case plot Nos.97, 98 and 99 of schedule No.3 of the pre­emption petition. So, the Court of Appeal below rightly allowed the pre­emption in respect of land of schedule No.3.<br/> <br/>6. It is apparent that the petitioner shall have to remove his huts constructed in the case land after making substantial improvement of the aid land and the price of land increased much since his agreement for purchase on 27.02.1965 but pre-emptor sale deed executed and registered on 04.08.1983. It is undoubtedly, a great hardship to the petitioner to be deprived of the case land without being paid the price of the land prevailing at the time of execution and registration of the disputed sale deed. But Section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act having not provided relief for such circum­stances it is not within the power of this Court to mitigate such hardship.<br/> <br/>7. The High Court Division on consid­eration of all materials on record viewed that the judgment and order dated 12.04.1994 passed by the High Court Division do not suffer from ille­gality and as such, there is nothing to interfere with the same.<br/> <br/>8. We also not find any cogent reason to differ with the findings arrived at by the High Court Division in the facts and circumstances of the case.<br/> <br/>In view of the above, we find no sub­stance in the submissions of the learned Counsel for the petitioner.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the petition is dis­missed.<br/> </div><div><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
