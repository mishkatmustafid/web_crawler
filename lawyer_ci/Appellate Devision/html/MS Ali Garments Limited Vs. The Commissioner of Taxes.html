Notice was served upon him,fixing date of hearing but he did not appear at the time of hearing and theDeputy Commissioner of Taxes took the matter for ex-parte hearing and held thatthe assessee intentionally avoided attending the case and made assessment undersection 84 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1984. The Deputy Commissioner of Taxesconsidered the audit report submitted by the company but found that supportingpapers including vouchers have not been filed and made the assessment fixing64.70% as the rate of gross profit. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>Against thesaid order the appellant filed an appeal being I.T. Appeal No. 56/coy-2/94-95and the same was heard by the Commissioner of Taxes(Appeal) who by his orderdated 30.10.1995 reduced the gross profit to 25% and also allowed deduction ofTk. 17,50,000/- but rejected the claim for rebate of 60% as a garments manufacturerand exporter. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>Against thesaid order the assessee appellant filed I.T.A. No. 1831 of 1995-96 before theTaxes Appellate Tribunal. The Tribunal directed the revenue authority to acceptthe sale as disclosed by them and also reduced the rate of gross profit to 20%from 25% holding that the decision was taken by the appellate authority oncomparison of records with parallel cases. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>Against thesaid order the appellant filed an application under section 160 of the IncomeTax Ordinance before the High Court Division stating that the TaxesAppellate Tribunal has illegally fixed gross profit at the rate of 20% insteadof 11.77%. the question of law under reference was couched in the followingterms:</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>“Whether in the facts and circumstances of thecase the Taxes Appellate Tribunal was justified in directing adoption of grossprofit at 20% in view of the fact that the petitioner’s accounts are auditedand verifiable, contrary to Income Tax Law and Procedure.”  </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>By the impugned judgment and order, the HighCourt Division rejected the reference application. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>Against the said judgement and order dated25.03.2001 the appellant filed a civil petition for leave to appeal. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>Leave was granted to consider the followinggrounds: </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>I. Whether theHigh Court Division acted illegally in holding that no question of law arose fortheir decision in considering the reference formulated and placed before them; </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>      II.Whether the respondent having not filed any affidavit-in-opposition in thereference application disputing the question of law as formulated norsuggesting any new question of law, the High Court Division acted illegally inholding that no question of law arose out of the order of the Tribunal; as suchthe reference application was not maintainable; and </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>III. Whetherthe High Court Division could itself have formulated the question referred byway of reference. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>Mr. Rafiq-ul-Huq,learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants made submissions in linewith the grounds upon which leave was granted. He submitted that the High CourtDivision acted illegally in not considering that the Tribunal applied GP at therate of 20% without taking into consideration the evidence on record when themisreading and non-consideration of evidence are questions of law and as suchthe appeal is liable to be allowed. The learned Advocate further submitted thatthe audit report was supplied containing a certificate from a CharteredAccountant certifying the correctness of the true income of the assessee, andas such the Tribunal was bound by the evidence given by the Appellant undersection 82 of the Income Tax Ordinance and as such the High Court Divisionacted illegally in holding that no question of law had arisen in the referenceapplication for their decision. He also submitted that the High Court Divisionacted illegally in not formulating any question of law as prayed for by theappellant. The learned Advocate lastly submitted that the question of law asformulated in the Reference Application does arise from the order of theTribunal and as such the High Court Division acted illegally in holding thatquestion of law does not arise for their decision in the instant ReferenceApplication and the impugned judgement is liable to be set aside and the appealmay be allowed. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>Mrs. Mahfuza Begum, learned AssistantAttorney  General appearing on behalf of the respondentsubmitted that the High Court Division on perusal of the materials on recordhas rightly held that no question of law has been raised before it because thedetermination of the rate of gross profit is not a question of law. In supportof her contention she referred to the decision in the Case of Commissioner ofIncome Tax A-Range, Chittagong Vs. Harendra Kumar Shil reported in 34 DLR (AD)298, where it was held that: </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>“Determinationof rate of gross profit for the particular year in respect of the particularbusiness or trade, is purely a question of fact, and that being so it could notbe made a ground for making reference under section 66(1) of the Income-taxAct.” </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>She furthersubmitted that the question of fact does not require to be controverted by filingan affidavit-in-opposition. As there was no requirement to controvert thequestion of fact raised before the High Court Division, the Revenue Departmentdid not file any affidavit-in-opposition and for non-filing ofaffidavit-in-opposition by the respondent, the appellant cannot be benefited inany manner. The learned A.A.G lastly submitted that the audit report was notaccepted by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes for want of supporting papers andthe appellant having not furnished any supporting papers either before theCommissioner (Appeal) or the Tribunal, their claim for being assessed at therate of 11.77% in respect of gross profit is not tenable and thus suggestion forreformulating the alleged question of law as claimed by the appellant does notarise. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>During the course of hearing Mr. </span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;Cambria","serif";'>Rafique-ul-Huq, learned SeniorCounsel submitted that the appellant supplied accounts certified by CharteredAccountants which under section 82 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1984 issufficient to deem the return as correct. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>On the otherhand, Mrs. Mahfuza Begum, learned A.A.G. submitted that the provisions ofsection 82 is only applicable if the certificate of the Chartered Accountantsis furnished on the prescribed form under Rule 64 A of the Income Tax OrdinanceRules, 1984. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>We have considered the submissions of the learned advocatesappearing for the parties concerned and perused the impugned judgement as wellas other evidence and materials on record.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>The relevant portions of section 160 of the Income Tax Ordinanceprovides as follows:</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>160 Reference to the High Court Division.-(1)The assessee or theCommissioner may, within sixty days from the date of receipt of the order ofthe Appellate Tribunal communicated to him under section 159, by application inthe prescribed form, accompanied, in the case of an applicaion by the assessee,by a fee of one hundred taka, refer to the High Court Division any question oflaw arising out of such order:</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>Provided further that the Board may, on an application made inthis behalf, modify or waive, in any case, the requirement of such payment.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>[……………………………]</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>(4) on receipt of the notice on the date of hearing of theapplication, the respondent shall, at least seven days before the date ofhearing submit in writing a reply to the application; and he shall thereinspecifically admit or deny whether the question of law formulated by theapplicant arises out of the order of the Appellate Tribunal.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>(5) If the question formulated by the applicant is, in the opinionof the respondent, defective, the reply shall state in what particular thequestion is defective and what is the exact question of law, if any, whicharises out of the said order; and the reply shall be in triplicate and beaccompanied by any documents which are relevant to the question of lawformulated in the application and which were produced before the DeputyCommissioner of Taxes, the Inspecting Joint Commissioner, the Appellate JointCommissionr, the Commissioner (Apepals) or the Appellate Tribunal, as the casemay be, in the course of any proceeings relating to any order referreed to insub-section (2)(a) or (b). </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>     The High CourtDivision observed that no audited accounts and papers relating to theapplicant’s accounts were either before the Commissioner of Taxes(Appeal) orbefore the Taxes Appelalte Tribunal. Having examined the reference applicationas well as the order of the Taxes Appellate Tribunal the High Court Divisionheld that no quesiton of law had arisen from the said order and the assessee-applicanthad not been able to formulate any point of law. In this regard the learnedA.A.G. has referred to the decision in the case of Cmmissioner of Income TaxA-Range, Chittagong Vs. Harendra Kumar Sil reportned in 34 DLR (AD) 298, whereit was specifically held that the determination of rate of gross profit ispurley a question of fact and could not be made a ground for making reference.Since that was the only point of reference made by the appellant before theHigh Court Divison, we are constrained to agree with the submissions of thelearned A.A.G that the respondents were not required to controvert the same byfiling an affidavit-in-opposition. We also note that under sub-section (4) the respondetnsare required to specifically admit or deny whether the question of lawformulated by the appelicant arises out of the order of the Appellate Tribunal.Since in view of the above mentioned decision of this Division, no question oflaw arose in the reference the respondents were not required to admit or denythe reference. Similarly the question of reformulating the qustion referred bythe applicant would only arise if the reference was indeed on a question oflaw. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>We are of the view that the High Court Division correctly found that no question of law had arisen. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>With regard to the submission of learned Counsel for the appellantthat the High Court Division itself could have formulated a point of law in themanner suggested, we are of the view that section 160 of the Ordinance does notprovide for any such action. Clearly it is for the assessee to formulate anypoint of law and make the reference to the High Court Division in theprescribed form. Under section 161 (2) the High Court Division is required onlyto hear and decide the question of law raised and, therafter, deliver itsjudgement stating the grounds on which the decision is founded. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>In the instant case the High Court Division found that no questionof law had arisen, which is fully in accrodance with the decision reported in34 DLR (AD) 298, mentioned above. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style='Cambria","serif";'>We do not find any illegality or infirmity inthe impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division, accordingly, theappeal is dismissed without however any order as to costs.</span></p><span id="pastemarkerend"></span> </div></div>
