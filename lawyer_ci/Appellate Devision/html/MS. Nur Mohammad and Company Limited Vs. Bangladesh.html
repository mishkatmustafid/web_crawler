No. 80 of 1998).<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Judgment</strong></span><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mohammad Fazlul Karim J.-</strong> This peti­tion for Leave to Appeal is directed against the judgment and decree dated 06.09.2007 passed by the High Court Division in First Appeal No. 80 of 1998 allowing the appeal setting aside those dated 27.11.1997 of the Subordinate Judge, 2nd Court, Chittagong in Other Suit No. 120 of 1993 thereby dismissing the same.<br/><br/>2. The facts of the case, in short, are that the plaintiff company is a private limited company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1913 and is a recognized company and it had got commendable cer­tificate from the Government as a foreign exchange earner and also got President's Medal and it is stated that the suit land originally belonged to a company which was a British Company incorporated in London as "Rally Brothers" and after the liberation of the country the said property had been declared as an abandoned prop­erty under President's Order No. 16 of 1972 and it was notified in the Gazette and on 3rd April, 1975 an administrator was appointed by the Government to look after the property and as the same action had not been in accordance with law the Government of Bangladesh had entered into an agreement with the "Rally Brothers" for purchase of the said compa­ny along with its properties on 23.02.1977 and thereafter, the defendant No. 1 namely the Government became the owner of the property and thereafter the said suit land had been transferred to and vested in Bangladesh Jute Corporation by operation of law and it was done under Section 19 of Bangladesh Jute Corporation Ordinance and in the said property there were some properties which had been lying as unused property and the Government decided to transfer those properties and on this score the Government constituted a sale com­mittee and the said sale committee took steps in this regard. The defendant No. 3 published a tender for sale of the suit land in the daily news paper on 20.06.1992 vide Tender No. 02 of 1992 and in the said tender the "Kha" schedule property had been included in item No.6 and after pub­lication of the said tender notice the plain­tiff had submitted a tender on 20.07.1992 amounting to Tk. 6, 02, 51,000.00 and as per the terms and conditions of the tender the plaintiff had deposited Tk. 60, 25,100.00 as earnest money in the Government Treasury. The plaintiff had been the highest bidder in respect of the property of "Ka" schedule and the defen­dant authority had accepted the said high­est bid of the plaintiff and decide to sell the property to the plaintiff and thereafter the Ministry of Jute by a telex dated 05.09.1992 had directed the Managing Director of the plaintiff company to come and meet with the Secretary of Ministry of Jute on 07.09.1992 and accordingly, the Managing Director of the plaintiff compa­ny met the Secretary and the plaintiff com­pany came to know from the Secretary that 3 (three) other suits namely Other Suit Nos. 81 of 1992, 82 of 1992 and 83 of 1992 over some properties of schedule "Ka" were pending before the Court of Subordinate Judge, 2nd Court, Chittagong and also stated in view of the pendency of the three other suits, the properties in respect of schedule "Ka" could not be transferred at that moment and also made a proposal to the plaintiff that if the judg­ment and decree of the said three other suits would go in favour of the Government then the defendant would sell those properties to the plaintiff company and the plaintiff by letter dated 16.09.1992 communicated the acceptance of the pro­posal to the defendant No.1. The defen­dant No.2 on 18.10.1992 by a memo had expressed their desire to sell the property of "Kha" schedule out of "Ka" schedule which were the subject matter of three suits. Thereafter, on 18.10.1992 the defen­dant No.2 had also issued a letter of intent in this respect and the proportionate price of the said property had been fixed at Tk. 4,50,00,000/- and also directed the plaintiff to deposit Tk. 4,50,00,000/- excluding the baina money of Tk. 45,00,000/- within 20.11.1992 and it was also proposed that if the plaintiff after disposal of three other suits deposit Tk. 1,37,25,100/- in respect of "Kha" schedule property then they would exe­cute and register the safkabala deed for the said property. The plaintiff later on came to know that two other suits being Nos.113 of 1992 and 114 of 1992 were pending before the Court of Assistant Judge, 2nd Court, Chittagong and also in the Court of Assistant Judge, 3rd Court, Chittagong other three suits namely Other Suit No.87 of 1992, 88 of 1992 and 89 of 1992 were pending in respect of "Kha" schedule property and in all the suits the plaintiff company had been made as defendants. The plaintiff company by let­ter dated 08.11.1992 informed the defendant No.1 about the pendency of the said suits in the Court of Assistant Judges and also made a proposal for deleting those properties from the letter of intent and accordingly, the defendant No.1 accepted the proposal of the plaintiff and the defen­dant No.1 by letter dated 15.11.1992 mod­ified the letter of intent issued by the defendant No.1 by memo, dated 18.10.1992 and as such, excluded the properties involved in those five suits and after exclusion of those properties the defendant No.1 revised the price of the suit land under 'Gha' schedule at Tk. 1,80,00,000/- which excluded the earnest money of Tk. 20,00,000/- and directed the plaintiff to deposit the said amount of Tk. 1,80,00,000/- and it was also decided by the defendant No.1 that after disposal of those suits if the plaintiff would pay Tk.4,02,5 1,000/- excluding the earnest money then the defendant No.1 would execute and register the said safkabala deeds and would also handover pos­session of the said excluded property, the plaintiff after receiving the letter of the defendant No.1 had deposited Tk.1,80,00,000/- by a payment order on 18.11.1992 in respect of "Gha" schedule property and also requested defendant No.1 to execute and register the saf-kabala deed and to hand over the. possession of the same to the plaintiff and the plaintiff thereafter on 23.11.1992 made a request to the defendant No.1 for execution and reg­istration of the said sale deed and also for delivering possession of the same and the defendant No.1 by letter dated 30.11.1992 had requested the Secretary of Bangladesh Jute Corporation to hand over possession of the "Gha" schedule property to the plaintiff by 07.12.1992 but Bangladesh Jute Corporation did not hand over pos­session of the property to the plaintiff and thereafter the plaintiff by letters dated 29.12.1992 and 17.02.1993 requested the defendant No.1 to hand over possession of the said schedule property but the defen­dant No.1 instead of handing over posses­sion of the said property most illegally had cancelled the letter of intent by a letter dated 02.03.1993 along with this letter sent a cheque of Tk.2,40,20,050/- to the plaintiff and thereafter the plaintiff sent a legal notice on 23.03.1993 to the defen­dant No.1 for executing and registering the said sale deed and also stated that if the defendant No.1 would withdraw the can­cellation of the letter of intent then the plaintiff would return the said cheque of Tk. 2,40,20,000/- and the defendant No.1 did not take any step for withdrawal of cancellation of the letter of intent and as such, the plaintiff through his lawyer, Barrister Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed, had informed the defendant No.1 that the plaintiff had been compelled to encase the said cheque under protest and for the pur­pose of mitigation the loss and damages arising out of illegal cancellation and as such, the plaintiff had been compelled to file the instant suit.<br/><br/>3. The defendant Nos. 1-5 contested the case filing written statement denying the material allegation that the suit is not maintainable in its present form, barred by limitation as well as the principle of estop­pel, waiver and acquiescence and further stated that as several suits are pending with relation to the major portion of the property and if a portion of the property is sold to the plaintiff then the Government would suffer loss and it might lead to fur­ther litigations in respect of those proper­ties and with a view to avoid further com­plication, the defendants had decided to rescind the letters of intent and the defendants further stated that there was no con­cluded contract between the parties over the suit property and as such, the plaintiff is not entitled to get a decree for specific performance of contract on the basis of letter of intent and also as per the terms and conditions of the tender notice the Government reserved the right to cancel any tender without assigning any reason whatsoever and the defendants had can­celled the letter of intent for public inter­est. Moreover, the plaintiff had enchased the cheque after the cancellation of the let­ter of intent and as such, the plaintiff is not entitled to get a decree for specific per­formance of contract and as such, the defendant Nos. 1-5 prayed for dismissal of the suit.<br/><br/>4. Mr. Mahmudul Islam, learned Counsel, appearing for the petitioner submitted that the defendant No.3 published a tender notice on 20.06.1992 for selling the prop­erty in an open auction and thereafter the plaintiff submitted a tender at Tk. 6,02,51,000/- and as per terms and conditions of the tender deposited a sum of Tk. 60,25,100/- as earnest money and thereafter the Ministry of Jute excluded some of the properties, as mentioned in the schedule of the tender due to penden­cy of several suits in different Courts at Chittagong and later on, after deduction by the plaintiff about the pendency of dif­ferent suits in different Courts at Chittagong also some properties had been excluded and the defendant No.2 had issued a letter of intent on 18.10.1992 excluding the properties which had been the subject matter of different suits and later on, the office of the defendant No.1 by another letter dated 15.11.1992 modi­fied the letter of intent dated 18.10.1992 by excluding the properties detected by the plaintiff in different suits and there­after the defendants directed the plaintiff to deposit Tk. 1,80,00,000/- being the proportionate price of the suit property excluding the earnest money and that after disposal of the suits which were pending in different Courts and if the plaintiff would pay Tk. 4,02,51,000/- excluding the earnest money the possession of the said excluded properties would be deliv­ered in favour of the plaintiff and accord­ingly, the plaintiff by pay order dated 18.11.1992 deposited Tk. 1,80,00,000/- as price of schedule "Ga" property and requested the defendants to hand over pos­session of the same but the defendants instead of handing over possession of the same illegally cancelled the letter of intent and sent a cheque of Tk. 2,40,20,050/- to the plaintiff; that the defendants had float­ed the tender for sale of the said property in the daily newspapers on 20.06.1992 and the plaintiff deposited earnest money of Tk. 60,25,100/- as per terms and condi­tions of the tender and the plaintiff became the highest bidder in respect of the proper­ty in question and thereafter due to the pendency of a number of suits in different Courts some of the properties had been excluded and later on the earlier letter of intent dated 18.10.1992 had been modi­fied on 15.11.1992 and the price of the property had also been revised and the plaintiff had been directed to deposit Tk. 1,80,00,000/- which being the propor­tionate price of the suit property excluding the earnest money and thereafter the plain­tiff by a pay order dated 18.11.1992 deposited Tk. 1,80,00,000/- as price of schedule property and in this connection it is pertinent to be mentioned that the sale committee of the defendants had accepted the price as offered by the plaintiff in respect of the properties and though this is discretionary power and this discretionary power cannot be exercised by the defen­dants after the confirmation of sale by the defendants and the said stage of cancella­tion had been over when the said cancella­tion letter was issued; that the plaintiff had encashed the payment order of Tk.2,40,20,055/- which had been sent by the defendant No.1 to the plaintiff after cancellation of the letter of intent but it is to be taken into consideration that the plaintiff had encashed the said payment order on protest and for the purpose of mitigating the loss and damages arising out of defendants illegal cancellation. The learned Counsel further submitted that it is settle principle of law that the defendants cannot be allowed to act inconsistently with its promise made by a letter of intent dated 18.10.1992 and which had been modified on 15.11.1992 and the same had been binding on all the defendants and the position being such the defendant No.1, the Government cannot be exempted from its liability to carry out of the promise given to the plaintiff and also the plaintiff had deposited the amount of Tk. 1,80,00,000/- being proportionate price of the suit property excluding the earnest money and the Government cannot escape from executing the contract by the doc­trine of promissory estoppel. The learned Counsel finally submitted that the Government is bound by the principle of promissory estoppel to execute the con­tract with the plaintiff and the true princi­ple of promissory estoppel seems to be that where one party has by his words or conduct made to the other a clear and unequivocal promise which is intended to create legal relations or effect a legal rela­tionship to arise in the future, knowing or intending that it would be acted upon by the other party to whom the promise is made and it is in fact so acted upon by the other party, the promise would be binding on the party making it and he would not be entitled to go back upon it, if it would be inequitable to allow him to do so having regarding to the dealings which have taken place between the parties and this would be so irrespective of whether there is any preexisting relationship between the parties or not. The doctrine of promissory estoppel need not be inhibited by the same limitation as estoppel in the strict sense of the term. It is an equitable principle evolved by the Courts for doing justice and there is no reason why it should be given only a limited application by way of defence. There is no reason in logic or principle why promissory estoppel should also not be available as a cause of action and non-consideration of this vital aspect of the case by the High Court Division is wholly illegal, misconceived and as such, liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>5. Mr. T. H. Khan, learned Counsel, appearing for the respondent submitted that no concluded contract for sale of schedule 'Gha' property has been executed by the defendants with the plaintiff and the letters of intent have been issued which are offer letters, on the basis of which, the plaintiff cannot claim for Specific Performance of Contract; that the plaintiff has accepted the cancellation of letters of intent and encashed the cheque for the value of schedule 'Gha' property deposited by it and therefore, it is estopped from instituting the suit for Specific Performance of Contract; that as per terms of the tender notice, the Government reserves the right to cancel the tender sub­mitted by the plaintiff and in exercise of that power, the defendants have cancelled the tender of the plaintiff against which the plaintiff does not acquire any right in the suit property and is not entitled to any relief against the actions of the defendants. The last contention of the learned Counsel is that a decree for Specific Performance being a discretionary one, the plaintiff having taken back the consideration amount by enchasing the cheque given by the defendants, it is not entitled to get any relief under Section 12 of the Specific Relief Act.<br/><br/>6. It appears from the record that upon cancellation of the letters of intent Exts.7 and 16 the  Government a cheque of Tk. 2,40,20,050/- which includes Tk. 1,80,000/- being the amount deposited against the value of the suit property plus the earnest money of Tk. 60,25,000/- by a letter under memo, dated 02.03.1993, Ext.14 returned to the plaintiff The plain­tiff accepted the letter and encashed the said cheque on 16.06.1993 by serving a legal  notice  through  its lawyer,  Ext. 17(Ka) stating "for the purpose of mitigat­ing the loss and damages arising out of your illegal cancellation" and intimated about legal actions to be taken against them. In the said legal notice the plaintiff did not say that it was ready to deposit the consideration amount if a demand is made. It is very pertinent to note that after the cancellation of the letters of intent acceptance of consideration money paid earlier the plaintiff waived its right to claim for specific performance of the con­tract in respect of the same property. An agreement once waived cannot be enforced subsequently. The conduct of the parties implies that they are relegated to the original position they were in before the contract was made.<br/><br/>7. Though the plaintiff encashed the cheque on the alleged plea of mitigating its alleged loss, the fact remains that it has accepted the cancellation of the letters of intent. If the plaintiff had challenged the letter of cancellation without encashing the cheque on the averments that it was willing to perform its part of the contract and claimed for specific performance of the contract, it would possibly a different case. It is settled law that where a party to a contract commits an anticipatory breach of the contract, the other party may choose to keep the contract alive till the time of performance and claim specific perform­ance but in that event he cannot claim spe­cific performance unless he show his readiness and willingness to perform the contract. The plaintiff could have institut­ed a suit for specific performance of con­tract on depositing the cheque in Court but it proceeded neither way. The plaintiff opted to encash the cheque for alleged mitigating its loss and thereby it had impliedly abandoned the contract. It fur­ther appears that, the plaintiff has in fact waived its right or interest in the suit prop­erty. After waiving its right, it cannot sub­sequently compel the defendants to hand over possession of the suit property on accepting the bid money again. The con­tract was rescinded by the defendants and the plaintiff did not challenge the said can­cellation. There is nothing left to be imple­mented by the defendants as per order of the Court. In a suit for specific perform­ance, it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove the existence of a concluded con­tract between in the parties and that the plaintiff is ready and willing at all materi­al dates to perform its part of the contract. The plaintiff has failed to prove the same. Though the plaintiff allegedly encashed the cheque conditionally, the defendants did not accept the condition of the plaintiff If the plaintiff felt that by reason of the delay in finalizing the deal it had suffered loss, it had its remedy for the said loss by instituting suit for damages and in that case, the Court would have been in a posi­tion to decide whether the plaintiff had suffered any loss for the acts of the defen­dants in finalizing the transaction. The plaintiff instead of proceeding as such exercised it discretion unilaterally leaving nothing for the Court to decide over the transaction. The fact remains that the con­tract, which existed between the parties, ceased to exit on the day of institution of the suit. There was no existence of con­tract in the eye of law between the plain­tiff and the defendants and therefore, the plaintiff was not entitled to a decree for specific performance of contract.<br/>In view of the above, we find no sub­stance in the submissions of the learned Counsel for the petitioner.<br/>Accordingly, the petition dismissed.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
