M. Ruhul Amin J. -</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 16.11.2005 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.393 of 1993 discharging the Rule.<br/><br/>2. Short facts are that the pre-emptor filed Miscellaneous Case No.15 of 1987 under section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act for pre-emption in the Court of Assistant Judge, Birol, Dinajpur stating, inter alia, that the pre-emptee Nos.6 &amp; 7 transferred the case land in favour of the pre-emptee Nos.1-5 by kabala dated 17.02.1987. The further case is that the land of S.A. No.316 measuring an area of 1.12 acre belonged to Jagadish Roy who settled the said land by registered kabulyat dated 22.03.1938 in favour of Dundu Shah, Dukhu Shah and Separ Mohammad. The S.A. record was prepared accordingly in their names. The pre-emptee Nos. 6-7 being co-sharers in the jote sold .09 acre of land by a kabala dated 17.02.1987 in favour of the pre-emptee Nos.1-5 who are stranger purchasers. The pre-emptor is a co-sharer by inheritance. No notice of the kabala under pre­emption was served upon the pre-emptor.<br/><br/>3. The pre-emptee Nos.1-5 contested the case by filing a written objection denying the material allegations made in the miscellaneous application and further contended that the case is barred under section 96(10) of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act. Their further case is that the land of C.S. Khatian No. 268 of Mouza and Police    Station Birol, District-Dinajpur belonged to Pamir Mohammad, the grandfather of the pre-emptee Nos. 1-5 and others. The preemptee Nos. 1-5 are co-sharers tenants to the said C.S. Khatian No.268. The S.A. Khatian was not recorded in the name of father of the pre-emptees through oversight. The co-sharership of the pre-emptee remains unaffected since they are also co-sharers by inheritance. So, the case is liable to fail against them.<br/><br/>4. The trial court allowed the pre-emption case. On appeal being Miscellaneous Appeal No.9 of 1988, the appellate court allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment of the trial court and dismissed the pre-emption case. Being aggrieved, the pre-emptor moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained the Rule, which after hearing was discharged.<br/><br/>5. We have heard Mr. M. Enayetur Rahim, the learned Advocate for the petitioner and Mrs. Khurshed Jahan, the learned Advocate-on-Record for respondent Nos.1-4   and perused   the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/><br/>6. It is not disputed that the pre-emptor and pre-emptee Nos.1-5 are co-sharers by inheritance in the disputed holding. Since the original jama of the C.S. Khatian remained intact, the pre-emption case hit by section 96(10) of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act as both parties are co-sharers by inheritance.<br/><br/>7. Accordingly, the High Court Division having found no merit in the Rule discharged the same.<br/><br/>8. In the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of view that the High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision. There is no cogent reason to interfere with the same.<br/>Accordingly, the leave petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
