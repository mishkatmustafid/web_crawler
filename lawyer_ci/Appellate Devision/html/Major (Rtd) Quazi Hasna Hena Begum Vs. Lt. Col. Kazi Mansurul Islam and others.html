The case of respondent No.1 as writ petitioner was that while serving in Bangladesh Army he applied for allotment of a plot in Johar-sahara residential project on 10.12.1991. Thereafter, at his request he was allotted an alternative Plot No. 281/C at Mohakhali D.O.H.S on 23.05.1993. Vacant possession was deliv­ered and lease deed was executed on 10.06.1993. He applied for approval of the plan and after obtaining necessary approval of the plan from the Cantonment Board, mortgaged the said plot and obtained loan for construction of residen­tial building thereon. After obtaining a loan of Tk.12 lacs to be paid in 6 install­ments of Tk. 2 lacs each from House Building Finance Corporation he con­structed structure up to 2nd floor of the 6(six) stories building. At that time he sud­denly got a letter from the office of the Dhaka Cantonment requesting him for his opinion for allotment of the plot in the joint name with his wife by a letter dated 28.06.1994. He replied that there would be legal difficulties in joint allotment and therefore, refused the proposal for joint allotment with his wife's name who is the petitioner before us. His further case was that the allotment authority considering his representation against the joint allot­ment and legal difficulties, unilaterally converted the single allotment into the joint allotment on 30.10.1994 and a lease deed of joint allotment was executed on 05.11.1994. It was also stated by him that the petitioner's wife, as per clause 6 of the prospective of defence officer’s housing project, was not entitled to apply for joint allotment of any plot as she had not com­pleted 18 years commission service in the Army and she was also owner of a govern­ment residential plot at Chittagong. She was also not in service at the time of the alleged joint allotment and the same was done with malafide intention and to harass him.<br/><br/>3. The High Court Division issued Rule Nisi upon the writ respondents to show cause as to why the letter of allotment dated 30.10.1994 issued by the Director, Military Land and Cantonment Directorate Ministry of Defence, so far as it relates to the writ respondent No.4, the present petitioner should not be declared to have been made without lawful author­ity and was of no legal effect and why the allotment of the entire plot should not be given  in favour of the  writ petitioner respondent No.1.<br/><br/>4. The Rule was opposed by the writ respondent No. 2, Director, Military Land and Cantonment Directorate Ministry of Defence and writ respondent No. 4 peti­tioner's wife of writ petitioner respondent No.1. It was stated that writ respondent No. 2 upon a request by the writ petitioner forwarded a proposal to the Ministry of Defence to allot the plot jointly and neces­sary approval was given by the Ministry after cancelling the previous allotment in favour of the writ petitioner respondent No.1 as per condition No. 6 (Ga) of the prospectus of defence officers housing project. The Military Land and Cantonment Directorate by their letter dated 30.08.1994 requested the writ petitioner to surrender his previous lease and he surrendered the case plot by registered surrender deed on 08.09.1994 and informed the office by his letter dated 15.09.1994. The case plot was accordingly allotted jointly in the names of the writ petitioner and his wife respondent No.4 according to the wish and consent of the writ petitioner. The writ respondent No. 4 in her affidavit-in-opposition, <em>inter alia</em>, stated that her husband, writ petitioner does not live at the address given in the writ petition and as a matter of fact she lives at that address i.e. House No.281/C, Road No.19/C now D.O.H.S. along with her son and daughters. She is in exclusive possession of the house on the allotted plot in question. The writ petitioner had left the house and was reportedly living with his second wife at Shamoly. The application for allotment of plot filed by the writ petitioner was intended to be on his own behalf and on behalf of the respondent No.4 as contemplated in clause 6(Ga) of the said prospectus of the housing project which provides that in case of the husband and wife both serving in the Army the senior of the two would have to apply and the plot would be allotted in their joint names. The writ petitioner was the senior officer and as such, he applied for allotment of the plot and as per law the single allotment of the writ petitioner was converted to joint allotment and accordingly registered lease deed dated 05.11.1994 was executed in joint names. The respondent No. 4 petitioner claimed that she had provided TK. 5,68,000.00 to her husband writ petitioner respondent No.1 for the purpose of construction of the house. She also stated that the writ petitioner respondent No.1 applied for loan of TK. 35,00,000.00 from Sonali Bank in joint names by forging her signature in 1995. She got a letter from the Bank with a request to register the mort­gage deed which she refused. This made her husband writ petitioner respondent No.1 angry and he started to torture her physically and accordingly, filed the malafide and false case.<br/><br/>5. Leave was granted to consider the sub­mission of Rokanuddin Mahmud, learned Counsel, appearing for the appel­lant that the letter of joint allotment dated 30.10.1994, acting in terms thereof the Government having executed a registered lease deed dated 05.11.1994 in favour of writ petitioner and leave petitioner in their joint names, the writ petition challenging the allotment letter alone, which has been fully acted upon is not maintainable inas­much as after the execution of the regis­tered lease deed, the allotment letter either has lost its efficiency or merged in to the registered deed that has created a vested right under it in favour of the leave peti­tioner and writ petitioner jointly and as such there remained nothing to challenge the allotment letter, and the High Court Division was wrong in making the Rule absolute declaring the allotment letter in joint names illegal whereas the registered deed executed and registered with consent and the behest of the writ petitioner which gives the title to both remains valid in law and thereby the High Court Division's judgment has created an anomaly, contra­diction and paradox; that the respondent No.1 by letter dated 31.07.1994 cancelled the earlier single allotment in favour of writ petitioner and directed registration in joint names, whereupon the writ petitioner wrote letters dated 15.09.1994 and 06.10.1994 surrendering the registration in his single name and requesting for registration in joint names as a result of which allotment letter dated 30.10.1994 in joint names was issued and thereafter exe­cution and registration of the lease deed in favour of writ petitioner and leave peti­tioner took place, the High Court Division was wrong in failing to hold that the writ petition raised complicated issue of title in the property in question as well as disput­ed question of fact which could not be decided in writ petition but the same need­ed a properly constituted suit for adjudica­tion; that the writ petitioner admittedly surrendered the plot relinquishing his right, title and interest thereon and requested for a joint allotment and as such barred by the principles of waiver, acqui­escence and estoppel from questioning the legality of allotment in joint names.<br/><br/>6. Rokanuddin Mahmud, learned Counsel, appearing for the appellant sub­mitted that since the joint allotment of plot is violative of allotment Rules disqualify­ing the appellant for allotment either indi­vidual or jointly for which the allotment was initially made through the writ peti­tion being the husband and senior officer under the Rules. It has been further submitted that the joint application for allot­ment thus being barred under the Rules, the appellant subsequently filed the appli­cation after the sanction of the plot in favour of husband for the said allotment in her name as well and accordingly the authority with the full consent and initial­ly allottee who has accordingly sought for cancellation of the allotment in his name and applied for joint allotment and accord­ingly registered deed of lease in joint name was registered canceling the previ­ous registration lease in single name whereby the appellant as well has acquired title and vested right in the prop­erty.<br/><br/>7. Khondaker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, learned Counsel, appearing for the respon­dent submitted that on the very basis the registered lease deed has no legal effect, the deed even if registered cannot create better title or any vested right in favour of the appellant; that the registered lease deed cannot remain valid in law if found by a competent Court; that the office of the 'Q.M.G.' and 'M &amp; Q' Department, Dhaka Cantonment issued Memo dated 22.06.1994 requesting the petitioner to send his opinion regarding allotment of his plot in joint names of which the writ petitioner gave a reply on 28.06.1994 expressing legal difficulties in joint allot­ment which in fact disclosed his mind regarding joint allotment and therefore subsequent registration on surrendering the single allotment in the facts and circumstances. Finally, the learned Counsel submitted that there was no violation of the terms and conditions of the single allotment by the respondent and as such, the subsequent joint allotment for not fault of the respondent against which the respondent raised objection is arbitrary and malafide; that the joint allotment impugned in the writ petition having been issued without any show cause and with­out assigning any reason is clearly against the principle of natural justice. The learned Counsel further submitted that in pursuance of joint letter of allotment dated 30.10.1994 acting in terms thereof, the Government executed a registered leave deed dated 05.11.1994 inasmuch the com­plicated title in the property in question as well as disputed question of fact which could not be decided in the writ jurisdiction which needed a property constituted Court of law for adjudication principle of waiver and acquiescence and estoppel from questioning the legality of allotment in joint names.<br/><br/>8. It appears that the writ petitioner on his own initiation filed an application to the authority for considering joint allotment of the plot canceling the single allotment in his name which the authority in terms of letter dated 13.10.1994 allowed the prayer of the writ petitioner and cancelled the earlier allotment in his own name and registered deed to that effect and the Government as well acted upon the exe­cuted registered lease deed dated 05.11.1994 in favour of the writ petitioner and the appellant in their joint names and accordingly the alleged challenging claimed on the basis of single allotment in the writ petition which the writ petitioner himself prayed for cancellation of the same and subsequent registration of the plot thereon and the authority has acted upon the same. The impugned allotment letter dated 30.10.1994 in the joint name in Annexure-G was of no avail and the writ petition, accordingly, was not main­tainable. The writ petitioner himself on his own and to his own volition allowed the single allotment dated 23.5.1993 of the Plot No. 281/C Mohakhali D.O.H.S. can­celled upon his application for allotment of the plot in joint name which the author­ity was pleased to allow and thereafter, issued sanction letter in joint name and got the registered deed registered in joint name with the concerned and co-operation of the writ petitioner which accordingly could not be subject matter of challenge in a writ jurisdiction. It will not be out of place to mention that clause 6(Kha) pro­vides that in case of an application for allotment of a plot if the spouses are in the service the qualification for allotment of a plot would be in the name of the senior and accordingly the plot was allotted in the name of the husband initially and upon consent of the husband thereafter, the said plot was allotted in the joint name and fol­lowing 6(Ga) the registration was done in joint name upon an application for allot­ment of plot by the senior officer i.e. the husband, writ petitioner who after allot­ment for the reason best known to him got the plot allotment and the registration in his own name alone instead of joint name. After sanction of plot, the said plot would be allowed in following the clause 6(Ga) allowed in joint name. It will not be out of place to mention that the writ petitioner having realized his fault by the letter to the authority applied for cancellation of the plot in his own name and accordingly the said letter dated 31.07.1994 in favour of the writ petitioner was cancelled and was directed for registration of the plot in joint name upon the writ petitioner by his letter dated 15.09.1994 and 06.10.1994 surren­dered the registered deed in his single name with the requested for registration of the plot in joint name. As a result, the vio­lation of the allotment letter dated 30.10.1994 in the joint name was issued and the registration deed of lease was accordingly executed and registered in joint name.<br/><br/>9. The High Court Division observed that "the whole argument of the learned Counsel for the petitioner is that admittedly the petitioner had got the single allotment but the respondent No.4 without having any requisite qualification managed to force the petitioner to execute and register of joint allotment in respect of the suit plot has no basis of law. The petition­er at the very beginning was unwilling to the joint allotment but being in active service in army he had no other alternative but to give consent for the sake of service and family bondage. The petitioner being a member of the disciplined force had to give his consent and this aspect of the case can not be altogether to brush aside in view of the letter of the respondent to the Ministry of Home Affairs vide Annexure-3 of the affidavit-in-opposition."<br/><br/>10. In writ jurisdiction the disputed ques­tion of fact or any doubt that might crop up could not be resolved in the writ peti­tion. In the instant case, the High Court Division has acted upon, <em>inter alia</em>, on those 'if and 'but' without allowing the parties to resolve the same in an appropri­ate forum but in a cursory manner dispos­ing of the writ petition filed challenging of order which the writ petitioner himself has given go-by and consequently fresh order of allotment and registered deed was exe­cuted in the name of husband and wife.<br/><br/>11. Admittedly, the writ petitioner surren­dered the single allotment in his own name alone and for following provision of rule 6(Ga) of the Arms Officer residential project prospectus Rule 6(Ga) which reads ‡mbv evwnbw‡Z PvKzixiZ ¯^vgx I ¯¿xi †¶‡Î PvKzix‡Z †Rô¨ Awdmvi‡K Av‡e`b Kwi‡Z nB‡e Ges c­U hyM¥ bv‡g eivÏ Ki‡Z nB‡e| The alleged letter of the office Q.M.G. and M &amp; Q depart­ment, Dhaka Cantonment issued Memo dated 22.06.1994 and alleged reply dated 28.06.1994 of the writ petitioner was a product of afterthought which was not there during the allotment and registration of the deed in the joint name and accord­ingly the joint allotment is of no fault of the appellant against which the writ peti­tioner raised objection is without any basis and surely as such a matter of afterthought which cropped up after the love lost between the husband and wife and a sub­ject matter of disputed question of fact.<br/><br/>12. Since the single allotment was can­celled and the joint allotment was done with the full consent and at the behest of the writ petitioner no question issuing of show cause notice or for assigning any reason was required and accordingly there could be no violation of principle of natu­ral justice.<br/><br/>13. Furthermore, we are of the view that in the instant case in view of the admitted joint allotment in the name of husband and wife and subsequent registration of the lease deed in joint name upon cancellation of the previous allotment and transaction in single name on the prayer of the writ petitioner. Moreover, the writ petitioner received TK.5,68,000.00 from respondent No.4 appellant for the purpose of procur­ing the plot and construction work as evi­dence from General Irrevocable Power of Attorney executed by the writ petitioner on 04.11.1993. Construction of the ground floor of the house and structural works of the 1st and 2nd floors were also done by the fund provided by Respondent No.4 appellant inasmuch as the writ petitioner again received TK.3,06,000.00 from respondent No.4 from completion of the construction work and this fact is evi­denced in the 'Receipt and Agreement dated 20.11.1994 executed between the writ petitioner and respondent No.4-appellant. The aforesaid documents are also annexed as Anncxure-9 and 9A in affidavit-in-opposition. TK. 10,00,000.00 out of 12,00,000.00 was also received by the petitioner from house building finance corporation as loan was deposited by him in his own name in Islamia Umma Corporation as evidenced from an applica­tion dated 10.06.1996 of the petitioner regarding the said depositing and a money receipt dated 26.01.1995 annexed as Annexure-10 and 10A in affidavit-in-opposition. Furthermore, the petitioner applied for a loan of TK. 35,00,000.00 from Sonali Bank, Dhaka Cantonment Branch in joint names though forging sig­nature of respondent No.4-appellant and drew the money by opening joint account in 1995.<br/><br/>14. Under the circumstances and in the context of the above admitted fact subse­quent challenge thereto is also barred by the principle of waiver and acquiescence and relinquishment of his earlier sanction letter in the single name. This writ petition is barred by the principle of waiver, acqui­escence. The propositions of waiver and acquiescence have been aptly discussed in the case of <strong><em>Akhlasur Rahman and others vs. Safarullah and others </em></strong>reported in<strong><em> 42 DLR (AD) 189. </em></strong>The words 'waiver' and 'acquiescence' and the abandonment of the writ was aptly considered in Halsbury's Laws of England, 3rd Edition, Volume 14, page 637 wherein it is stated that "Wavier, is the abandonment of the right, and is either expressed or implied from conduct, a person who is entitled to the benefit of a stipulation in a contract or a statutory provision many waive it, and allow the contract or transaction to pro­ceed as though the stipulation or provision did not exist. Waiver of this kind depends upon consent and the fact that the other party has acted upon it is sufficient consid­eration. Where the waiver is not expressed, it may be implied from conduct which is inconsistent with the continuance of the right. It seems that, in general, where one party has, by his words of con­duct, made to the other a promise or assur­ance which was intended to affect the legal relations between them and to be acted on accordingly, then once the other party has taken him at his word and acted on it, the party who gave the promise or assurance cannot afterwards be allowed to revert to the previous legal relationship as if no such promise or assurance had been made by him, but they must accept their legal relations subject to the qualification which he himself has so introduced, even though is not supported in point of law by any consideration." In the same volume at page 638 it has been stated that "acquies­cence" in its proper legal sense implies that a person abstains from interfering while a violation of his legal rights is in progress and further that "Acquiescence operates by way of estoppels. It is acqui­escence in such circumstances that assent may reasonably be inferred, and is an instance of estoppels by words or conduct. Consequently, if the whole circumstances are proper for raising these estoppels, the party in acquiescence cannot afterwards complain of the violation of his right."<br/><br/>15. In the instant case, therefore, the facts proved has given rise to waiver and acquiescence, waiver i.e. abandonment of right and acquiescence for which the writ peti­tioner is estopped from challenging or alleged enforcement of his previous allot­ment in the single name. The conduct of the writ petitioner, however, clearly mani­fests that a Court of law can reasonably and validly make an inference of waiver and acquiescence. Even act of the writ petitioner-respondent and his participation in subsequent transaction do not, however, show any of his unwillingness or lack of consent at any time of the transaction. The writ respondent as well participated in the transaction by contributing sufficient fund at her disposal even at the stage of con­struction of the building as has been detailed in her affidavit-in-opposition.<br/>Accordingly, the conduct of the parties sufficiently manifests the principle of estoppel of waiver and acquiescence as well.<br/>In view of the above, the appeal is allowed without any order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
