Ruhul Amin CJ.- </strong>This appeal, by leave, is directed against the judgment dated November 26, 1996 of a Single Bench of the High Court Division in First Miscellaneous Appeal No. 9 of 1982 dismissing the same.<br/><br/>2. The Appeal was filed against the judgment and order dated June 29, 1982 of the 1st Court of Additional District Judge, Bakerganj in Miscellaneous Case No. 5 of 1980 allowing the same. The aforesaid miscellaneous case was regis­tered upon an application filed under Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure by the respondent herein in Title Appeal No. 166 of 1973 seeking review of the judgment and decree dated 31.12.79 affirming the judgment and decree dated August 22, 1973 passed in Title Suit No. 634 of 1970 decreeing the same. The suit was filed seeking decree for permanent injunction and for decla­ration that the property in suit is not enemy property i.e. vested property.<br/><br/>3. The appellant filed Title Suit No. 634 of 1970 seeking the relief as stated here-in before  stating,  <em>inter alia</em>,  that he obtained decree in Title Suit No. 198 of 1970 of the 1st Court of Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge, Bakerganj) and on the basis of the said decree got his name recorded in the rev­enue record, that the defendant No. 2 illegally declared the property in suit as enemy property and he having had came to know about the said fact filed objec­tion on November 5, 1970 and that the defendant No. 2 rejected the said objec­tion and thereupon treating the land in suit vested property threatened the appellants to evict from the land in suit.<br/><br/>4. The suit was contested by the defen­dant No. 2 alleging that the decree obtained in Title Suit No. 198 of 1970 was fraudulent one and that the same was filed impleading dead persons and that the appellant obtained the compro­mise decree therein showing dead per­sons as parties to the compromise. It was also the case of the defendant No. 2 that part of the property in suit along with building and tin shed requisitioned and the same is possessed by the defen­dants. The defendant also denied the possession of the plaintiff in the land in suit. The definite case of the defendant No. 2 is that the property in suit was treated as enemy property on February 18, 1967 since the owners of the proper­ty migrated to India, that recorded owner Sreenath Chatterjee died on July 24, 1947 and as such decree obtained in Title Suit No. 198 of 1970 showing said Sreenath Chatterjee as party to the com­promise was illegal.<br/><br/>5. The trial Court on consideration of the materials on record held that plain­tiff acquired title in the land in suit on the basis of the decree in Title Suit No. 198 of 1970 and thereupon got his name mutated in the revenue record and paid rent, that the defendant failed to estab­lish his contention that the decree in Title Suit No. 198 of 1970 was obtained against the deed persons. The trial Court also found possession of the plaintiff in the land in suit and thereupon decreed the suit with the finding that the order of treating the property in suit as enemy property is illegal. The trial Court restrained the defendant No. 2 perma­nently from interfering with the posses­sion of the plaintiff.<br/><br/>6. The defendant No. 2 went on appeal, Title Appeal No. 166 of 1973.  The appellate Court by the judgment and decree dated December 31, 1979 dis­missed the appeal and thereby affirmed the judgment and decree of the trial Court passed in Title Suit No. 634 of 1970 of the 2nd Court of Munsif (now Assistant Judge) Barisal on August 22, 1973.<br/><br/>7. As against the judgment and decree in Title Appeal No. 166 of 1973 the respondent herein i.e. the appellant in the afore mentioned appeal filed an application under Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure seeking review of the appellate judgment contending that at the time of hearing of the suit and the appeal the appellant i.e. the respon­dent herein could not place matrial doc­uments i.e. death certificate of Sreenath Chatterjee and the record of the Requisition Case No. 55 of 1959.<br/><br/>8. In the petition for review it was stated that the plaintiff of Title Suit No. 634 of 1970 is claiming the property on the basis of the decree obtained in Title Suit No. 198 of 1970, which was filed averring that the land in suit orally was set tied to him by the recorded tenants, that the suit i.e. Title Suit No. 634 of 1970 was contested by the defendant No. 2, i.e. petitioner in the review petition whereupon Miscellaneous Case No. 5 of 1980 was registered, primarily contending that the recorded tenants of the property left for West Bengal, India and thereupon their property in question was treated as enemy property and that some of the recorded tenants died long before obtaining decree in Title Suit No. 198 of 1970, that the solehnama on the basis of which Title Suit No. 198 of 1970 was decreed was a fraudulent one and that the said solehnama said to have been signed by the persons who died long before filing of the Title Suit No. 198 of 1970, that the government is in possession of the property on the basis of Requisition Case No. 55 of 1959, that during the trial as well as at the time of hearing of the appeal inspite of upon exercising due diligence could not brought on record the vital papers, i.e. the record of the Requisition Case No. 55 of 1959 and the death certificate of Sreenath Chatteree who died on July 24, 1947.<br/><br/>9. The application for review was opposed by the plaintiff in Title Suit No. 634 of 1970 i.e. plaintiff-respondent in Title Appeal No. 166 of 1973 contending that the death certificate of Sreenath Chattrejee sought to be produced before the Court by the petitioner is forged and that the petitioner had all the opportunities to produce the death certificate and the record of the requisition case before the trial Court as well as before the appellate Court but he did not do so and that the petitioner is guilty of serious latches and negligence and as such the review application field seeking produc­tion of the papers for the consideration of the Court which he could have pro­duced earlier should not be allowed as the petitioner is guilty of latches and negligence.<br/><br/>10. The appellate Court by the order dated June 29, 1982 allowed the review application on the finding "Thus I am convinced that the date of death of Sreenath Chatterjee is 24.7.47. When a man died in July, 1947 he cannot be made defendant in a suit filed in 1970 or he cannot appear or effect a compro­mise. If the death certificate could have been procured at the time of the appeal, this would have in all possibilities nega­tived the O.Ps. claim. The Requisition record also shows that a portion of the property was under requisition at the time when the decree was obtained. In such circumstances, it cannot but be said that the petitioner could not produce the death certificate and the record of the Requisition case at the time when the decree was passed and the petitioner has been aggrieved because of this by such a decree. Therefore, the application under Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure for review of the judgment should be re-heard. The point is accord­ingly disposed of."<br/><br/>11. As against the order of the 1st Court of Additional District Judge, Bakerganj allowing the Miscellaneous Case No. 5 of 1980 the plaintiff of Title Suit No. 634 of 1970 moved the High Court Division in appellate jurisdiction, First Miscellaneous Appeal No. 9 of 1982. The High Court Division dismissed the appeal upon observing "The learned Court of appeal below in the circum­stances of the case held that the petition­ers could not produce the death certifi­cate and the record of the Requisition Case No. 55 of 1959 at the time when the decree was passed inspite of exercise of due diligence and the petitioners have been aggrieved and accordingly allowed the application for review under Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure and passed order for re-hear­ing of the appeal. I have already pointed out that the application under Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure was simply allowed and an order was passed for re-hearing of the appeal i.e. Title Appeal No. 166 of 1973. So that appellant's claim that the judgment and decree dated 31.12.1979 passed in Title Appeal No. 166 of 1973 affirming the judgment and decree dated 22.8.1973 passed in Title Suit No. 634 of 1970 of the 2nd Court of Munsif, Barisal were set aside is not correct. The appeal being Title Appeal No. 166 of 1970 as per order of the Court of appeal below be re­heard."<br/><br/>12. Leave was granted to consider the contentions that the High Court Division failed to consider the scope of the review petition in the light of the provision of review provided in the Code of Civil Procedure and thereupon the High Court Division while allowing the review directed the re-hearing of the appeal, that High Court Division failed to take into consideration that the defen­dant has attempted to avoid the provi­sion of Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure taking recourse to pro­vision of review under Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure and neither the lower appellate Court which passed the impugned order of review nor the High Court Division decided the rigours of proof lying on the defendant in producing additional evidence while getting an appeal disposed of on consid­eration of the evidence and that the High Court Division has not given direction as to how the alleged death certificate will be considered without allowing the plaintiffs a chance of disproving the same, that the High Court Division failed to consider that decree obtained by the plaintiffs in the previous suit being based on prior compromise between them and the original owner of the property the present plea of the defendant in the instant suit to the effect that the compromise decree was a fraud­ulent one is not maintainable unless a separate suit is instituted by the defen­dant for the said purpose.<br/><br/>13. The learned counsel in support of the appeal submitted that respondent was required to seek remedy against the decree in Title Suit No. 198 of 1970 and unless the said decree is set aside plain­tiffs right, title and interest in the land in suit remains fortified and the genuine­ness of the decree in Title Suit No. 198 of 1970 can no way be the subject mat­ter of the appeal re-hearing whereof has been ordered by the appellate Court and affirmed by the High Court Division, that the respondent has chosen wrong forum to agitate the question of obtained the decree in Title Suit No. 198 of 1970 against the dead persons, that there is no scope to consider the review application in view of the provision of Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as the facts alleged for review were very much within the knowledge of the respondent, particularly the record of the Requisition case and as such the same having not been produced before the Court or step having not been taken for production thereof before the Court it cannot be said that after due diligence the said record could not be produced before the Court, that facts pleading which the review application was filed were pleaded in detail in the written statement and that as the same demon­strate that the facts sought to be placed before the Court through the review application were very much within the knowledge of the respondent and he having had not taken step for production thereof, either before the trial Court or the appellate Court, the High Court Division as well as the lower appellate Court were error in allowing the review application in total disregard of the pro­vision of Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, that the issue raised as to matter of death of Sreenath Chatterjee could have been brought before the Court by leading oral evidence but hav­ing had not done so inspite of the fact that in the written statement in detail the said issue was raised and as such the High Court Division as well as the appellate Court were in error in allowing the review application and thereby in allowing the respondent to brought on record the fact which could have been brought on record at the time of trial as well as at the time of hearing of the appeal and thus the action of the High Court Division as well as of the appel­late Court in the name of the re-hearing of the appeal is nothing but given premi­um of the latches or negligence to the respondent.<br/><br/>14. Let us see how far the application for review allowed by the trial Court and affirmed by the High Court Division was legally competent and sustainable.<br/><br/>15. The provision for review in Order 47 Rule 1 reads as follow:<br/>"<strong>1.</strong> (1) Any person considering himself aggrieved-<br/>(a) by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed, but from which no appeal has been preferred.<br/>(b) by a decree or order from which no appeal is allowed, or<br/>(c)  by a decision on a reference from a Court of Small Causes,<br/>and who, from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or order made, or on account of some mistake or error appar­ent on the face of the record, or for any other sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of the decree passed or order made against him, may apply for a review of judgment to the Court which passed the decree or made the order", (rest of the provisions are not necessary for the disposal of the appeal)<br/> <br/>16. It is seen from the aforesaid provi­sion of the law relating to review that an application for review is entertainable from the discovery of new and impor­tant matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not with­in the knowledge or could not be pro­duced by a party at the time when the decree was passed or order made, or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for any other sufficient reason.<br/><br/>17. In the instant case as it appears from the judgment of the High Court Division and the appellate Court that the review was sought to be brought before the Court the certified copy of the death reg­ister relating to the fact of death of Sreenath Chatterjee said to have died on July 24, 1947, one of the owners and the recorded tenants of the land in suit and who was a signatory to the compromise petition on the basis of which Title Suit No. 198 of 1970 of the 1st Court of Subordinate Judge, Barisal was decreed and thereby title of the appellant herein in respect of the land  in suit was declared and further the record of Requisition Case No. 55 of 1959 was not within the knowledge of the respon­dent herein.<br/><br/>18. The law relating to the review as in Order 47 Rule 1 is that a review of a decree or order may be sought on the discovery of an important matter or evi­dence which after exercise of due diligence was not within the knowledge of the person seeking review at the time of hearing of the case and the decree was passed. In the instant case as is seen from the written statement of the defen­dant No. 2 (herein respondent) that the facts on the basis of which review of the judgment and decree passed in Title Appeal No. 166 of 1973, which was pre­ferred against the judgment and decree passed in Title Suit No. 634 of 1970 decreeing the suit, which was a suit for permanent injunction and for a further declaration that the property in suit is not enemy property (now vested proper­ty) was sought were categorically stated therein. In the written statement it was categorically asserted by the respondent herein that Sreenath Chatterjee one of the recorded tenants of the land in suit died on July 24, 1947. The fact of requi­sition of part of the property was also stated in the written statement.<br/><br/>19. In the afore state of the matter in our opinion the facts i.e. record of the Requistion Case No. 55 of 1959 and the fact of alleged death of Sreenath Chatterjee on July 24, 1947 were very much within the knowledge of the respondent herein who sought for review of the decree passed in Title Appeal No. 166 of 1973. We are of the view as the facts averred in the written statement i.e. requisitioning of the prop­erty in suit by initiating Requisition Case No. 55 of 1959 and the alleged death of Sreenath Chatterjee were with­in the knowledge of the respondent herein and as such it can reasonably be held that the respondent being in posses­sion of property and death of Sreenath Chatterjee. In that view of the matter it can not be said that the respondent at the time of passing the decree in Title Appeal No. 166 of 1973 was not aware' of the said materials and was not in pos­session of the papers on the basis of which review has been sought, since the respondent having had not been in pos­session of the materials relating to requi­sition of the property in Requisition Case No. 55 of 1959 and the materials relating to death of Sreenath Chatterjee, he would not have asserted the fact of death and the date as July 24, 1947 and as such there is no reasonable ground for the respondent to produce the said papers at the time of hearing of the appeal, review of the judgment and decree whereof was sought by filing the application for review alleging the facts i.e. record of the Requisition Case No. 55 of 1959 and the certified copy of the death register relating to the death of Sreenath Chatterjee which very much within the knowledge of the respondent and as such it cannot be said that the said facts could not be discovered at the time of hearing of the appeal "after the exercise of due diligence", since in the background of the facts averred in the written statement it can reasonably be said that the respondent was very much in possession of the materials for the production whereof review application has been filed seeking review of the decree passed in Title Appeal No. 166 of 1973 and there being no explanation why those materials could not be pro­duced before the Court at the time of passing the decree sought to be reviewed, we are of the view the appel­late Court ought not have entertained the review application and thereupon passed the order allowing the review for re-hearing of the appeal.<br/><br/>20. On perusal of the judgment of the High Court Division it is seen that the said Division affirmed the order allow­ing the review application upon observ­ing "the learned Court of appeal below in the circumstances of the case held that the petitioners could not produce the death certificate and the record of the Requisition Case No. 55 of 1959 at the time when the decree was passed for re-hearing of the appeal i.e. Title Appeal No. 166 of 1973 so that appellant's claim that the judgment and decree dated 31.12.79 passed in Title Appeal No. 166 of 1973 affirming the judgment and decree dated 22.8.1973 passed in Title Suit No. 634 of 1970 of the "2nd Court of Munsif, Barisal were set aside is not correct. The appeal being Title Appeal No. 166 of 1973 as per order of the Court of appeal below be re-heard". On perusal of the aforesaid observation of the High Court Division and the view expressed by the said Division it appears that the said Division has misconstrued, in the background of the facts on record, the provision of review as in Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In that view of the matter in our view the High Court Division was in error in maintaining the order of the appellate Court allowing the prayer for review for re-hearing of the appeal. The law relat­ing to review and the time tested ground(s) entitling one of the parties in the judgment has been re-stated in the case of Basharatullah, being dead his heirs: <strong><em>Fazle Karim and others Vs. Government of Bangladesh and others </em></strong>reported in <strong><em>(1996) 16 BLD (AD) 9</em></strong> wherein it has been held: "Consistently with the principle that there is to be end to the litigation, it is the well-recognized that review is not an appeal nor re-hearing merely on the ground that one party or another con­ceives himself to be dissatisfied with the decision sought to be review. Unless a prayer for review is based on the grounds mention above the Court will not sit on the matter again for a re-hear­ing or further hearing which is already concluded by decision even if that be erroneous".<br/>21. It may be mentioned in the instant case review was sought said to be on discovery of new and important matter or evidence which was not known or could not be produced before the Court.<br/><br/>The High Court Division as well as the appellate Court while considering the propriety and legally of the prayer for review were of the view that respondent was not aware of the materials on dis­covery whereof prayed for review and as such said materials could not be pro­duced before the Court. As mentioned herein before the contention of the respondent as to discovery of the mate­rials only after disposal of the appeal is being negatived by the definite aver­ments about the said materials in the written statement. Because of the nature and kind of the statements made about the materials on the basis whereof review has been sought it can reason­ably be said that unless those materials were being in the possession of the respondent the said statement could not have been made.<br/><br/>22. It is seen from the judgment of the High Court Division as well as from the order passed by the trial Court allowing the application for review that the respondent, who was the petitioner in Miscellaneous Case No. 5 of 1980, sought review for consideration of the genuineness of the decree passed in Title Suit No. 198 of 1970 on the ground that the said decree was obtained with­out impleading the respondent and fur­ther for bringing the fact before the Court that the decree in the said suit was obtained upon impleading the dead per­son, particularly Sreenath Chatterjee who said to have died on July 24, 1947 and as such the compromise decree obtained in the afore mentioned title suit was not a genuine one. The matter of death of Sreenath Chatterjee on July 24, 1947 has been sought to be brought before the Court by producing death certificate. Suffice it to say the genuieness of the decree obtained in Title Suit No. 198 of 1970 was not an issue in Title suit No. 634 of 1970 of the 2nd Court of Munsif (now Assistant Judge, Barisal) as against the whereof Title Appeal No. 166 of 1973 was filed and dismissed. Title suit No. 634 of 1970 was filed seeking the decree for permanent injunction and for a declaration that the property in suit is not an enemy proper­ty (now vested property). The said dec­laration was sought on the basis of the decree obtained in Title Suit No. 198 of 1970. The respondent under the law was required to sought relief against the decree passed in Title Suit No. 198 of 1970 for establishing its contention that the decree was not genuine since the same allegedly to have been obtained impleading dead person as defendant and consequently obtaining of compro­mise decree on the basis of the compro­mise entered into between the plaintiff herein appellant and the defendant. Since the subject matter of the Title Suit No. 634 of 1970 out of which Title Appeal No. 166 of 1973 arose was quite different and distinct from the relief sought through review of decree in Title Appeal No. 166 of 1973, i.e. seeking of relief against the decree passed in Title Suit No. 198 of 1970, the respondent was required to file separate suit seeking setting aside of the decree earlier obtained by the appellant in Title Suit No. 198 of 1970. The High Court Division and the appellate Court lost sight of the matter that respondent's endeavour to have the relief against the decree passed in Title Suit No. 198 of 1970 upon resorting to review of the decree passed in Title Suit No. 166 of 1973 was misconceived one and also was not legally well founded.<br/><br/>23. In view of the afore state of the mat­ter we find merit in the submission of the learned Advocate for the appellant that respondent was required to seek remedy against the decree passed in Title Suit No. 198 of 1970 by instituting a separate suit and that the respondent by re-sorting to review had chosen a wrong forum for ascertaining the ques­tion of genuineness of the decree obtained in Title Suit No. 198 of 1970.<br/><br/>24. It has already been mentioned here­inbefore that the application for review was not legally well conceived one since the facts alleging which review was sought were very much, in the back­ground of the averments made about those facts in the written statement of the respondent filed in Title Suit No. 634 of 1970, within the knowledge of the respondent.  It also may be men­tioned that there was specific plea in the written statement Sereenath Chatterjee died on July 24, 1947 but the respondent did not take any step to establish the said fact. From the averments made in the written  statement it  is  seen  that the respondent was  in possession  of the materials in support of alleged death of Sreenath Chatterjee on July 24, 1947 and in that view of the matter for re-agi­tating the said fact upon resorting to review was not legally competent. The contention, as stated hereinbefore, upon making which leave was obtained, in our view, in the background of the mate­rials on record appears to be of merit, primarily question of genuineness of the decree obtained in Title Suit No. 198 of 1970 was not an issue in Title Suit No. 634 of 1790 out of which Title Appeal No. 166 of 1973 arose, second issue as to genuineness of the decree in Title Suit No. 198 of 1970 could only be the sub­ject matter of a suit seeking declaration about the said decree i.e. decree in Title Suit No. 198 of 1970 and in no way can be the matter for adjudication within the scope of Title Suit No. 634 of 1970 as framed and the review as sought. We have already mentioned herein before that the ground upon which review was sought as in no way conform to the requirement of the provision of law as in Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure for maintaining and applica­tion for review or entitling a person to seek review against a decree, the order of the High Court Division affirming the order of the appellate Court passed in Miscellaneous Case No. 5 of 1980 allowing the application filed seeking review for re-hearing of the appeal was not maintainable.<br/><br/>25. In the background of the discussion made hereinabove we find merit in the appeal.<br/><br/>26.  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed without any order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
