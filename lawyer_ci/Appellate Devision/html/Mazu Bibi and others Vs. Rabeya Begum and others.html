Ruhul Amin J.-</strong> The appeal, by leave, is by the petitioners in the Miscellaneous Case against the judgment dated December 2, 1997 of a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 3504 of 1991 making the Rule absolute obtained against the judgment and order dated November 30, 1989 of the Court of District Judge, Magura in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 26 of 1985 setting aside the judgment and order dated May 30, 1985 (Order No. 48 dated 30-5-1985) in Miscellaneous Case No. 214 of 1983 dismissing the same. The Miscellaneous Case was registered upon an application filed on November 6, 1983 under Order IX, rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) seeking setting aside of the <em>ex parte </em>decree dated September 26,1983 passed in Title Suit No. 849 of 1979.<br/><br/>2. The suit was filed seeking declaration of title in respect of 4.69 acres of land and confirmation of possession as to part of the land in suit and recovery of possession as to part of the property in suit and for permanent injunction. The suit was filed making averments that land measuring 5.04 acres belonged to and possessed by Zinder Sheikh and Harun Sheikh and in their names CS khatian was prepared, that Zinder Sheikh by amicable arrangement was enjoying 4.23 acres of land and he died leaving 2 sons, i.e. plaintiff Nos.1 and 2 and a daughter plaintiff No.3, that at the time of death of Zinder Sheikh plaintiffs were minor and that immediately after the death of Zinder Sheikh when preparation of record of right was started the plaintiffs being minor they could not get the record prepared in their names and in that state of the matter land in suit was wrongly recorded in the name of the predecessor of the defendants, that as against the wrong record while the plaintiffs were taking step for filing suit the defendants dispossessed the plaintiffs from the 'kha' schedule land in Bhadra 1386 BS although they have no right, title and interest in the land where from they dispossessed the plaintiffs, that plaintiffs have their homestead in 'ka' schedule land and that taking advantage of wrong record of right the defendants are preparing themselves to demolish the plaintiffs' hut and to dispossess them from the 'ka' schedule land and in the aforestate of the matter plaintiffs are constrained to file the suit.<br/><br/>3. The defendant Nos.1 and 2 contested the suit by filing written statement denying the material averments made in the plaint and stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the land in suit belonged to Biddut Lata Sengupta who acquired the same by auction purchase and she transferred the land in suit to Zinder Sheikh who executed a kabuliyat in favour of Biddut Lata Sengupta, that Zinder Sheikh later on transferred the land to Harish Chandra Nani Bala and others and they transferred the land  to the defendant Nos.1 and 2 by registered kabala and thus they acquired right, title and interest in the land in suit and accordingly, SA record was prepared in their names, that defendants acquired the right, title and interest in the land in suit by various kabalas, that plaintiffs earlier filed Title Suit No. 418  of 1976 and  that while  the defendants were contesting the said suit the same was withdrawn, that the plaintiffs have filed the suit making untrue statements, that after service of  summons  the  defendants entered appearance in the Title Suit No. 849 of 1979 and filed written statement.<br/><br/>4. The suit was fixed for peremptory hearing on September 26, 1983 and on that date defendants having not appeared the suit was decreed <em>ex parte.</em><br/><br/>5. The defendants seeking setting aside of the <em>ex parte </em>decree filed an application under Order IX, rule 13, CPC and thereupon Miscellaneous Case No. 214 of 1983 was registered. The case of the petitioners in the Miscellaneous Case i.e. defendants in Title Suit No. 849 of 1979, was that defendant No.4 was the Tadbirker and he having had fallen ill on the date of peremptory hearing he could not take steps in the suit on September 26, 1983 and, as such, the suit was decreed <em>ex parte</em>, that after the reopening of the civil court on 1st of November,1983 the defendant No.4 went to the Court to ascertain the position of the Title Suit No. 849 of 1979 and then PW 4, the clerk of the defendant’s Advocate, informed him that the suit had already been decreed on September 26, 1983 <em>ex parte</em>. Having had the information from the PW 4 the petitioners i.e. the defendants, filed the Miscellaneous Case on November 6, 1983. It may be mentioned there are 12 defendants in the suit and the Miscellaneous Case has been filed by the said defendants. It was the case of the defendants that defendant No.4 was their Tadbirker and he having had fallen ill the suit was decreed <em>ex parte</em>.<br/><br/>6. The Miscellaneous Case was opposed by the plaintiffs, i.e. opposite parties, in the Miscellaneous Case contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the Miscellaneous Case was barred by limitation and that defendants were aware of the date of peremptory hearing of the suit and that they intentionally allowed the suit to be decreed <em>ex parte </em>for the purpose of depriving the plaintiffs from the fruit of the suit. It was also the case of the opposite parties that the defendants filed certain documents before the Court which were forged and fabricated and that apprehending that in case of prosecuting the suit or, in other words, opposing the claim of the plaintiffs placing reliance on the said documents there  is  likelihood  of   being prosecuted under the penal  law for  using forged and fabricated document before  the Court claiming those to be genuine in spite of knowing the  same  are  not  genuine   they allowed the suit to be decreed ex parte. It was also the contention of the plaintiff-opposite parties that by the <em>ex parte </em>decree defendants had not suffered any loss or injury.<br/><br/>7. The trial Court on consideration of the evidence of PWs 1-3 arrived at the finding that the defendant petitioners were fully aware of the date of peremptory hearing of the suit and thereupon dismissed the Miscellaneous case.<br/><br/>8. It was the case of the defendant-petitioners that their Tadbirker, defendant No. 4, who was petitioner No.4 in the Miscellaneous case, was ill and as such step could not be taken and consequent thereupon suit was decreed <em>ex parte</em>. It may be mentioned defendant No. 4 who was petitioner No. 4 in the Miscellaneous Case has not deposed in the Miscellaneous case. The trial Court observed that in support of the defendants' case that the defendant No. 4 was the Tadbirker and he was ill on the date of peremptory date of hearing no medical certificate was produced and the neighbouring and independent witness was also not examined. The trial Court also observed while dismissing the Miscellaneous Case that there were other defendants who could have taken steps in the suit while their Tadbirker was ill but they did not do so and there is no explanation as regard that. The trial Court also observed that the case was barred by limitation and no substantial cause was shown in the petition for condonation of delay. The trial Court dismissed the Miscellaneous Case on the finding that the defendant petitioners failed to establish that their Tadbirker defendant No.4, who was petitioner No.4 in the Miscellaneous Case, was ill on the date of peremptory hearing of the suit and that the Miscellaneous Case was also barred by limitation and that no substantial cause was shown for condonation of delay.<br/><br/>9. The defendants went on appeal. The appellate Court reversed the judgment and order of the trial Court on the finding that PWs 1, 2 and 3 have deposed that defendants' Tadbirker defendant No.4 i.e. petitioner No. 4 in the Miscellaneous Case, was ill and as against that the lone witness examined by the opposite parties in the Miscellaneous case could not prove that the defendant No. 4 was not ill and that the defendants allowed the suit to be decreed <em>ex parte </em>'wilfully'. The appellate Court in setting aside the order of the trial Court has observed "that the petitioners were diligently pursuing the suit and there is no laches on their part before the <em>ex parte </em>decree. Had petitioner No.4 been not attacked with fever at the relevant time than definitely he would take steps when the suit was called for hearing". On the question of limitation, the appellate Court has observed that petitioner No.4 (defendant No.4) came to know about the <em>ex parte </em>decree on November 1, 1983 from PW 4 Salamat Molla, registered clerk of the defendants' learned lawyer, and thereupon, filed the suit on 6-11-1983 and there is no reason to disbelieve the PW 4 and thus it appears that petitioners were not aware of the <em>ex parte </em>decree "till 1-11-83 and as such, the application is not barred by limitation". As stated hereinbefore the petitioner No. 4 who is said to have been the Tadbirker of the defendants has not deposed in the case. This being the position the appellate Court was in serious error in arriving at a finding placing reliance on the evidence of PW 4, the clerk of the learned Advocate of the defendants, that the Miscellaneous case was not barred by limitation. The petitioner No.4 i.e. defendant No. 4, the tadbirkar of the defendants, was competent to depose about initial knowledge about <em>ex parte </em>decree on 1-11-1983 and then had he been corroborated by PW 4, then there could have been the finding as made by the appellate Court, the Miscellaneous case was not barred by limitation. It may also be mentioned that the appellate Court set aside the order of the trial Court upon surmise and conjecture that had the Tadbirker defendant No. 4 been not ill the suit was not decreed <em>ex parte </em>since defendants were contesting suit by filing written statement in that the defendant No.4 inspite of being petitioner No.4 in the Miscellaneous Case did not depose in the Miscellaneous Case that he was ill on the date of peremptory hearing and no explanation was offered for not examining him. As seen from the judgment of the trial Court that no medical certificate was produced in support of the defendants' contention that their Tadbirker defendant No. 4 was ill on the date the suit was decreed <em>ex parte </em>and that no neighboring witness was examined to establish the fact that defendant No. 4 was ill on the date the suit was decreed <em>ex parte</em>. PWs 1-3 as it appears, are the petitioners in the Miscellaneous Case and as such, they are interested witnesses and the trial Court discarded their evidence on assigning reason. It may also be mentioned that the appellate Court set aside the judgment of the trial Court placing onus wrongly on the OPW 1 that he could not prove that defendant No. 4 was not ill on the date the suit was decreed <em>ex parte</em>. Had defendants established their case that their Tadbirker was ill on the date the suit was decreed <em>ex parte </em>by examining independent, witness and that particularly examining defendant No. 4 who as claimed to have been the Tadbirker, in that case only onus would have been on the plaintiff-opposite parties to disprove the case of the defendants, but defendant-petitioners having had not established their case by independent witness that defendant No. 4 was ill on the date the suit was decreed <em>ex parte </em>there was no onus on the plaintiff-opposite parties to establish that the defendant No. 4 was not ill.<br/><br/>10. As against the judgment of the appellate Court the plaintiff-opposite parties (in the Miscellaneous Case) moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction. The High Court Division made the Rule absolute on the findings that the Miscellaneous Case was barred by limitation and that no sufficient explanation was offered in support of condonation of delay. It may be mentioned the <em>ex parte </em>decree was passed on September 26, 1983 and the Miscellaneous Case was filed on November 6, 1983. Since the summons were duly served on the defendants as per provision of Limitation Act they were required to file the Miscellaneous Case within 30 days from the date of <em>ex parte </em>decree and that as the civil Court was on vacation in the month of October when period of limitation expired they were required to file the Miscellaneous Case on the reopening of the civil Court i.e. on 1st of November, 1983, but the Miscellaneous Case was filed on November 6, 1983. To establish that the Miscellaneous Case was not barred bv limitation the defendant-petitioners examined PW 4, clerk of the defendants' learned Advocate, who deposed that on 1st of November, 1983 when defendant No. 4 (petitioner No. 4 in the Miscellaneous Case) went to the Court and tried to ascertain the position of the suit he then on 1-11-1983 informed the defendant No. 4 that the suit had already been decreed <em>ex parte </em>on September 26, 1983. The defendant No. 4 i.e. Tadbirker of the defendants who was petitioner No. 4 in the Miscellaneous Case, has not deposed in the Miscellaneous case. This being the position that the defendants had no knowledge earlier than 1-11-1983 was not established as because defendant No. 4 i.e. petitioner No. 4 in the Miscellaneous Case, has not deposed in the case to establish that he for the first time came to know about <em>ex parte </em>decree from PW 4 on 1-11-1983. In the background of the aforesaid state of the fact the High Court Division observed that the appellate Court "misdirected himself in his total approach on the question of limitation and under misconception of law recorded the finding that the petitioners (defendants) having not been aware of the <em>ex parte </em>decree dated 26-9-1983, the application is not barred by limitation". The High Court Division also considered the fact that there was in all 12 defendants who entered appearance in the suit and filed written statement and, as such, even if defendant No. 4, as claimed to be the Tadbirker of the defendants, was ill, one among the other defendants could have taken step in the suit and that could have collected the information about the position of suit from their learned Advocate or from the clerk of the learned Advocate, but the defendants did not care to do so and thereupon allowed the suit to be decreed <em>ex parte </em>and that also filed the miscellaneous case beyond the prescribed period of limitation without explaining the delay satisfactorily and that without establishing the fact of knowing of the <em>ex parte </em>decree on 1st of November, 1983. The High Court Division on consideration of the materials on record held that defendants failed to prove that their Tadbirker was ill on the date the suit was fixed for peremptory hearing and as such, it cannot be said that defendants had sufficient case for not appearing in Court on the date of peremptory hearing of the suit.<br/><br/>11. Leave  was granted  to consider the contentions  that  the  learned  District judge having believed  the PWs and  the medical certificate  in  support of the  illness of the defendant No.4 the High Court Division was in error in reassessing  the  evidence  while sitting in  revisional  jurisdiction and that because of the judgment of the High Court Division the appellants were non suited although they were contesting the   suit diligently and without any laches as found by the lower appellate Court.<br/><br/>12. The learned Advocate-on-record for the appellants has reiterated the contentions making which leave was obtained by the appellants. As against the contention of the appellants the learned Advocate-on-record for the respondents submitted that no medical certificate was produced by the appellants in support of their case that their tadbirker defendant No. 4 was ill on the date of peremptory hearing of the suit and that neighbours were also not examined to establish that the defendant No. 4 was ill and that on the top of everything defendant No. 4 who was petitioner No. 4 in the Miscellaneous Case did not depose in the case supporting the case of the defendants that he was the tadbirker of the defendants and was ill on the date the suit was decreed <em>ex parte</em>. The learned Advocate-on-record also submitted that there was no explanation why the defendant No. 4, who was petitioner No. 4 in the Miscellaneous Case, did not depose supporting defendants' case that he was ill on the date the suit was decreed ex parts. It has also been submitted on behalf of the respondents that the appellate Court set aside the judgment of the trial Court upon surmise and conjecture in that even if, as observed by the appellate Court, the defendants were diligent in prosecuting the case, but the case pleaded seeking setting aside of the <em>ex parte </em>decree was not established by examining independent witness and that also by not producing medical certificate in support of the illness of the defendant No. 4, the tadbirker of the defendants and that in not examining the neighbours of the defendant No. 4 to establish that on the date of peremptory hearing defendant No. 4 was ill, even if defendants were diligent, which is nothing but surmise and conjecture by the appellate Court, in prosecuting the suit that could not have been the ground for setting aside the <em>ex parte </em>decree, as the appellate Court did, when defendants failed to offer sufficient explanation for not being present in Court on the date of peremptory hearing or, in other words, defendants having had failed to prove the case as pleaded seeking setting aside of the <em>ex parte </em>decree. It has also been submitted by the learned Advocate-on-record for the respondents that the Miscellaneous Case was hopelessly barred by limitation since the same was filed beyond 30 days from the date of decree or at the latest having had not been filed on the 1st of November, 1983 i.e. on the reopening of the Court after vacation. He continued that although defendants tried to establish that the Miscellaneous Case was not barred by limitation by examining PW 4, the clerk of the defendant’s learned Advocate, but his evidence was of no use for the defendants since the person to whom, i.e. defendant No. 4, he disclosed on 1-11-1983 about the fact of disposal of the suit by <em>ex parte </em>decree did not depose in the case and thus the initial knowledge about the <em>ex parte </em>decree remained unestablished and consequent thereupon the Miscellaneous Case filed on 6-11-1983 was certainly barred by limitation, since defendants were required to file the suit on 1 st of November, 1983 as period of limitation was intervened by civil Court vacation and the civil Court reopened on 1st of November, 1983.<br/>In the background of the discussions made hereinabove we find no merit in the appeal.<br/>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed without any order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
