The petitioner was falsely implicated in the false allegation out of previous grudge and enmity.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> After submission of the said reply the respondent was pleased to withdraw the order of suspension and put the petitioner on duty and he was working as before till the petitioner was dismissed from service and get annual increment and pay.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> By letter dated 21.10.1995 and 27.11.1995 the petitioner was asked to appear before the enquiry officer which the petitioner did while the enquiry officer did not examine any witness of the corpo­ration in presence of the petitioner inas­much as the attendance register of the petitioner has not been examined so as to ascertain the duty time of the petitioner.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> Subsequently the respondent No.2 again issued 2nd show cause notice on 23.12.1995 and the petitioner on getting the same submitted its reply in the same way as before denying the false allega­tions brought against him. Subsequently by letter dated 14.01.1996 the petitioner was most illegally dismissed from his per­manent service which was received on 16.01.1996. Thus the same is mala fide, void, illegal and without lawful authority.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> Afterwards on 21.01.1996 the petitioner submitted his grievance notice to the Chairman under registered post to redress his grievances but the same was not redressed as such the petitioner has been compelled to file the aforesaid case.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> Said Complaint Case No.5 of 1996 was heard on 06.12.2003 by the Chairman, Second Labour Court, Dhaka who upon hearing the parties and on a careful con­sideration of the facts, circumstances and the materials on record was pleased to allow the case and directed the respondent writ petitioners to reinstate the petitioner with full back wages and other benefits within 30 days.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong> Being aggrieved by the aforesaid lawful and bona fide judgment and order passed by the Chairman, Second Labour Court, Dhaka, Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation field Writ Petition being No.661 of 2004 before the High Court Division and obtained Rule Nisi and the High Court Division after hearing the par­ties made the Rule absolute and set aside the judgment of the labour court.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong> As against the judgment and order of the High Court Division the petitioner has filed this petition for leave to appeal.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong> Heard Mr. Md.
