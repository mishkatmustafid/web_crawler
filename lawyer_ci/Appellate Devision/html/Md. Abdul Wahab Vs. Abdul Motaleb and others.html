Hassan Ameen J.-</strong> The petitioner (pre-emptee) seeks leave to appeal against the judgment and order dated 15-03-2006 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.4966 of 2003 discharging the Rule and affirm­ing the Order No. 142 dated 25-10-2003 passed by the learned Senior Assistant Judge, Sadar, Jhenidah in Miscellaneous Case No. 149 of 1988 allowing the appli­cation for delivery of possession.<br/><br/>2. The facts of the case, in short, are that the opposite-party No.1 as preemptor filed Miscellaneous Case No.149 of 1988 under Section 24 of the Non-Agricultural and Tenancy Act depositing 10% of the kabala money as compensation money against the pre-emptee-petitioner and others on 30-10-1988 for preemption of the case land measuring 3½ decimals in case Plot No 193 as described in the schedule of the preemption petition. The case was allowed by the trial Court.<br/><br/>3. The pre-emptee hereinafter referred as petitioner filed Miscellaneous Appeal No. 48 of 1993 against the said judgment and order and the appeal was allowed reversing the trial court judgment. The pre-emptor hereinafter referred as opposite party No.1 preferred Civil Revision No. 8 of 1996 in the High Court Division against the judgment and order of the appellate court below and the rule was issued and made absolute setting aside the same. The petitioner preferred civil petition for leave to appeal before the Appellate Division against the judgment and order of the High Court Division which was rejected summarily.<br/><br/>4. Thereafter the opposite party No.1 filed an application before the trial court for delivery of possession. Trial court by his order dated 21.10.2001 allowed the appli­cation and issued writ of possession. The process server went to the case land to execute the same but came back and returned the writ unexecuted 26.10.01 with report that he found a pucca building in the suit land. The opposite party No.1 the filed an application for rectification of the writ of possession on 31.10.2001. The trial court allowed the application of the opposite party on contest vide order dated 18.2.2002 directing to issue fresh writ of possession. The petitioner moved the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 890 of 2002 against the said order and obtained Rule. The Rule was made absolute on contest directing the trial Court to issue writ of possession in due consideration of the Schedule of the pre­emption miscellaneous case and the Schedule of the impugned kabala. Thereafter, the opposite party No.1 made an application to the trial court according­ly on 26.7.2003 for issuing fresh writ of possession. The trial court passed the impugned order on hearing both the sides-issuing a fresh writ of possession.<br/><br/>5. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid impugned order dated 25.10.2003 the peti­tioner moved the High Court Division on an application under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained the Rule. The learned Single Judge of the High Court Division upon hearing the par­ties discharged the Rule without any order as to cost and vacated the order of stay granted earlier by the Court. Hence this leave petition.<br/><br/>6. Mr. Md.  Nurul Amin, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner, submits that the High Court Division erred in law in not complying with the decision of Civil Revision No.890 of 2002 dated 15-03-2003 and the High Court Division failed to consider that the kabala dated 15-03-1988 will shown that the nature of the land in the deed also shown as paddy land. He further submits that in view of fact the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division erred in law in making the Rule absolute. He further submits that the pre-emptor did not claim the homestead on the case land in his application for pre-emp­tion and the Court also did not give any finding to get possession in resect of homestead on the suit plot. The execution Court could not go beyond his order in such view of the matter, the High Court Division erred in law in making the Rule absolute. He lastly submits that the pre­emption case was filed on 30-10-1988 and a local inspection was made on 10-11-1988   where it was found that “নালিশী দাগের সর্বশেষ দক্ষিনে বিবাদী ওহাব সাহেবের বসতবাতি। উত্তর বাটীতে দক্ষিন পাশে আনুমানিক ২০ ফুট লম্বা ও ১২ ফু্ট চোড়া কাঁচা পোতা উপরে গোলা পাতার ছাউনি বিশিষ্ট এক টি শয়ন ঘর এবং ছোট্ট একটা খরের রান্না ঘর আছে" which indicates that his thatched hut was made before 30-05-1988 and the case of the pre-emptee that this thatched hut was made after the purchase from opposite-party No.2 on 24-02-1981 and during pendency of the preemption case the pre-emptee removed the thatched hut and constructed their pucca building in the preempted land. In view of the fact the learned Judge of the High Court Division erred in law in making the Rule absolute.<br/><br/>7. We have heard the learned Advocate for the petitioner and perused the materials available on record and reasons to believe that there is no merit in the submissions thereof and accordingly the petition for leave to appeal is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
