To enable a plaintiff to acquire title by adverse possession, his possession must be actual, open and notorious and hostile character as to amount to ouster of exclusion of the real owner. The plaintiff has utterly failed to prove his title in the suit lands. PW 1 stated the he got decree in Title Suit No. 62 of 1997, Exhibit 3. This decree shows that he had got decree against Habib Ullah Miazi, Osman Ali Sheikh, Momtaz Uddin Sheikh, Jamaluddin Bepari, Md Bhudul Mia on compromise and <em>ex parte </em>against the rest. Those persons who filed solenama had no title in the suit lands. The decree was executable but admittedly he failed to execute the decree and thus, the decree was rendered infructuous after expiry of three years of the date of passing the decree. Moreso, no right or title is conferred on the plaintiff on the strength of the said decree. The suit being declared enemy property any other decree except that the suit land is not an enemy property was of no avail.                                                       …… (5)</strong></div> <br/><strong><em>Lawyers Involved:</em></strong><br/><em>Khurshid Alam Khan, Advocate instructed by Nurul Islam Bhuiyan, Advocate-on-Record—For the Petitioners.</em><br/><em>None represented —The Respondents.</em><br/><br/><strong>Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1674 of 2007.</strong><br/>(From the judgment and decree dated the 29th day of August, 2007 passed by the High Court Division in Appeal from Original Decree (FA) No. 286 of 1993).<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Judgment</strong></span></div><strong>              </strong><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mohammad Fazlul Karim J.-</strong> This petition for Leave to Appeal is directed against the judgment and decree dated 29-8-2007 passed by the High Court Division in Appeal from Original Decree No.286 of 1993 dismissing the appeal.<br/><br/>2. The facts of the case, in short, are that the suit land belonged to Guru Doyal Chakraborty, Ram Charan Chakraborty, Bhabani Charan Chakraborty and Kalipada Chakra­borty, of them Guru Doyal Chakraborty pro­posed to sell the suit property to plaintiff and on the mediation of the local elders, the price of the suit property measuring 7.80 acres of land was fixed at Taka 8,000 and thereafter, he executed an agreement on 30-11-1963 on receipt of Taka 6,000. It was decided between the parties that Guru Doyal would execute a sale deed after receipt of the balance consideration of Taka 2,000 on obtaining necessary permis­sion required for the purpose of registration of a deed. Guru Doyal handed over possession of the suit property in favour of the plaintiff on the same day. Guru Doyal failed to execute the sale deed after obtaining income tax clearance certificate and national certificate. Guru Doyal died on 17-9-1966 leaving behind the defendant Nos.1-6 who tried to dispossess the plaintiffs whereupon he instituted Title Suit No.331 of 1967 in the Court of 2nd Munsif, Chandpur for permanent injunction and subsequently the defendant Nos.1-6 filed a solenama in the suit. The defendant Nos.1-6 did not execute the sale deed despite repeated demands and left this country and pursuant thereto, he instituted a suit being Title Suit No.62 of 1970 in the 3rd Court of Subordinate Judge, Comilla for specific performance of Contract. One Julu Mia Patwari also instituted two suits, one is Title Suit No.62 of 1967 for permanent injunction in respect of the suit property, another being Title Suit No.237 of 1969 for specific performance. All the suits were tried analogous and pursuant to a solenama filed between the parties, the plaintiff got a decree on 23-11-1973. But he failed to get a sale deed registered through the Court as he failed to deposit the balance consi­deration of Taka 2000. The plaintiff acquired title by adverse possession in the suit land from the date of execution of the agreement.<br/><br/>3. The defendant No. 27 contested the suit by filing written statement denying all the material allegations stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the recorded owners of the suit property Guru Doyal and Ram Charan Chakraborty left this country in 1965 for India and accordingly, the property was declared as enemy property. The plaintiff created a forged agreement with a view to grab the suit property.<br/><br/>4. Mr. Khurshid  Alam  Khan, learned Advocate, appearing for the petitioner, submit­ted that the plaintiff's possession, after having been held hostile by defendant Nos.1-6, was admitted by them by filing solenama in the Court and therefrom his possession was open and notorious to all who were also parties in the different suits; that the plaintiff’s possession in the suit lands became adverse to the real owners and/or the persons claiming under them for more than twelve years when he failed to acquire title by virtue of a kabala intended to be executed and registered by the real owners, Guru Doyal or his heirs, defendant Nos.1-6; that the cause of action of the suit for the plaintiff arose on the service of notice of sur­render upon him as issued by the defendant No.25 while defendant No.27 evidently failed to prove its case; that the whole proceeding of the UP Case No.691 of 1984-85 is, in fact, void <em><img src="file:///C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image002.gif" style="height:16px; width:16px"/>ab initio</em>, moreso, when both defendant No.25 and defendant No.27 failed to bring on record any material in support of the plea that the property in question was an enemy property; the learned Courts below have caused failure of justice by holding that the same is enemy property although, in fact, there is nothing on record for drawing such a conclusion.<br/><br/>5. It appears from the record that there is no sufficient pleading in support of plaintiff's claim of adverse possession in the suit land and there is also no legal evidence as well in sup­port of plaintiff's claim. To enable a plaintiff to acquire title by adverse possession, his posses­sion must be of actual, open, notorious and hostile character as to amount to ouster of exclusion of the real owner. The plaintiff has utterly failed to prove his title in the suit lands. P.W1 stated that he got decree in Title Suit No. 62 of 1997, Exhibit 3. This decree shows that he had got decree against Habibullah Miazi, Osman Ali Sheikh, Momtazuddin  Sheikh, Jamaluddin Bepari, Md. Bhudul Mia on com promise and <em>ex parte</em> against the rest. Those persons who filed solenama had no title in the suit lands. The decree was executable but admittedly he failed to execute the decree and thus, the decree was rendered in fructuous after expiry of three years of the date of passing the decree. Moreso, no right or title is conferred on the plaintiff on the strength of the said decree, the suit having been declared enemy property any other decree except that the suit land is not an enemy property was of no avail.<br/>In view of the above, we find no substance in the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner.<br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
