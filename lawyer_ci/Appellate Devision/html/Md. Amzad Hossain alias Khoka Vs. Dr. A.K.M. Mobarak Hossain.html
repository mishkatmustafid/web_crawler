Joynul Abedin J. -</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 24.04.2006 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 2149 of 2000 discharging the Rule.<br/><br/>2. The short fact is that the plaintiff-respondent Nos.1-8 instituted Other Class  Suit No. 56 of 1993 in the court of the Assistant Judge, Trishal, Mymensingh for  declaration of title in the suit land and also for recovery of khas possession contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit land situated in  the Alahari Mouza under Trishal Thana of District Mymensingh belonged to Ex-Zamindar Binayak Das Acharjaya  Chowdhury and accordingly the same was correctly recorded in their name in 321  settlement Khatian. Binayak Das Acharjaya Chowdhury built a big tin-shed Kachary house in the suit land where the Nayebs used to collect taxes. In S.A. Operation, son of Binayak Das, Bakul Acharjaya Chowdhury gave the said Kachari Ghar to the plaintiff for looking after it and the plaintiff used to practice as a doctor in the Kachary. In 1959 Bakul  Acharjaya Chowdhury sold the said  Kachari house to one Ayub Ali Master and  the purchaser removed the said Tin shed  house from the suit land and re-built it in  his own house. Thereafter Bakul Acharjaya Chowdhury sold out the suit land to the plaintiff by registered kabala dated 25.09.1960 and handed over posses­sion to him. The Pakistani Army burnt the said registered kabala in 1971 from his house at Purabari Bazar. During R.O.R. Operation the suit land was recorded in the name of Bakul Acharjaya Chowdhury but the plaintiff was owning and possess­ing the same by fishing and cultivating and paying rent to the government in his name. Thereafter the defendant petitioner tried to have a fraudulent settlement deed in his name from Bakul Acharjaya Chowdhury. In 1988 the plaintiff acquired a saleable interest decree from Trishal Assistant Judge Court and on 29.01.1988 the defendant dispossessed the plaintiff by force and since then the defendant peti­tioner has been living there with his fami­ly; the defendants had no possession in the suit land before dispossessing the plaintiff. Thereafter the plaintiff filed a criminal case against the defendant No.1 and the documents of the defendants were challenged and it was kept in safe custody which case was dismissed for non-prose­cution.<br/><br/>3. The defendant-petitioner No.1 contest­ed the suit by filing written statement denying all the material allegations of the plaint alleging that the suit belonged to the then Zamindar Haridas Acharjaya Chowdhury and C.S. record was prepared in the name of Haridas, Bidhu Bhushan, Shredam, Binayak, Tarak Das, Priya Kumar and Shalil Kumar. Thereafter the father of the defendant No.1 took pattan by way of "Hukum Nama" on 22nd Ashin, 1357 B.S. in the name of the defendant No.1. The father of the defendant No. 1 used to possess the suit land because the defendant No.1 had been living in the town for carrying on business. The defendant No.1 came back to his village home and with the financial assistance of his father built a house in the suit land and has been living there with his family since then. During R.O.R. Operation, R.O.R. working parcha was prepared in the name of defendant No.1 vide No.321/1 but at the time of final publishing of R.O.R. this suit land was recorded in the name of the Ex-Zamindar. The plaintiff is a cunning person and he in collusion with a Muchi family who is the pattan receiver of a por­tion of the suit land and with the assis­tance of a deed writer and Head Clerk of the District Registrar office made a fraud­ulent deed which was shown to have been prepared on 20.09.1960 and registered on 25.10.1960. The plaintiff never had any title and possession in the suit land. The plaintiff then managed to have the suit land recorded in his name. Hence the defendant No.1 made objection under sec­tion 31 which is now pending for disposal. The plaintiff is harassing the defendants by filing criminal case and achieved a fraudulent decree in Other Class Suit No.12 of 1984 without impleading him as party. The aforesaid decree is not binding upon him and the instant suit is liable to be dismissed in favour of defendant No.1.<br/><br/>4. The trial Court after considering both oral and documentary evidence on record dismissed the suit by a judgment and decree dated 30.08.1994. The plaintiff thereupon preferred Other Class Appeal No. 326 of 1994 before the learned District Judge, Mymensingh and thereafter the learned Subordinate Judge, 2nd Court, Mymensingh by the judgment and decree dated 30.08.1994 allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment and decree passed by the trial.<br/><br/>5. The defendant No.1 thereafter preferred Civil Revision No.2149 of 2000 in the High Court Division and a Single Bench of the High Court Division then discharged the rule by affirming the aforesaid judgment and decree passed by the appellate court below decreeing the suit. Hence the defendant-petitioner filed this civil petition for leave to appeal.                  <br/>    <br/>6. Abdul Quayum, the learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that the impugned judgment and order passed by a Single Judge of the High Court Division is not supported by any material evidence on record and the same is accordingly liable to be set aside for the ends of Justice. The learned Advocate further submits that the learned Single Judge failed to consider that after 1950 the Zaminder had no right to transfer the land due to the commencement of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act.                <br/>   <br/>7. We have heard the learned Advocate for the petitioner and perused the connected papers including the impugned judgment, we do not find any substance in the points raised. The High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision. We therefore find no reason to interfere with the same.<br/>The petition is accordingly dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
