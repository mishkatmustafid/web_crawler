The petitioner filed the above miscellaneous case under section 24 of the Non Agricultural Tenancy Act stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the case land situated at C.S. Dag No. 1006 was owned by Hanif Faruk Ansari; the S.A. record contained 13 decimals of land of the above dag and also other land of the Jote; Hanif Faruk Ansari died leaving opposite party Nos. 2-15 who, on 20.1.1995, sold 6 ½ decimals of land from the aforesaid dag to the petitioner and on 3.4.1995 they, without any  notice to the petitioner also sold the disputed land measuring 6 ½ decimals to the pre-emptee opposite party No.1 who is a stranger to the case land; the petitioner on  6.4.1995 came to know about the disputed kabala and than he procured certified copy of the same and filed the case on 08.04.1995.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">3. The pre-emptee opposite party Nos. 1, 17 and 19, who are the respondent Nos. 1-3 herein, contested the case by filing writ­ten objection contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that Nanda Lal and others who were the ten­ants under Solemanddin, the superior landlord, sold the case land to Hanif Faruq Ansari and others; on 22.5.60 Hanif Faruq Ansari sold 43 decimals of land from Khatian No. 751 and 32 decimals of land from Khatian No. 752 in favour of Karim Box, Hedayetullah and Rahim Box; on 27.05.66 Hanif Faruq Ansari along with others also sold 8 decimals of land of S.A.

The learned Senior Assistant Judge, after hearing, allowed pre-emption. On appeal the learned; Additional District Judge, Kurigram, after hearing, allowed the appeal. Then the High Court Division after hearing discharged the Rule.                                    </div><div style="text-align: justify;">4. The learned counsel for the petitioner  submitted that the High Court Division did not consider that the petitioner is a co sharer of the case land by purchase and the  opposite party No. 1, the respondent No.1 herein, admittedly is a stranger to the case land and the pre-emption case was main­tainable as the deed under challenge was executed on 3.04.1995, which was earlier then the deed dated 04.04.1995; the respondent No.1 subsequently sold the case land on 4.4.95 collusively to defeat the right of the petitioner and further the High Court Division erred in law in hold­ing that in view of the provision of clause (a) of sub-section 11 of section 24 of the Non-Agriculture Tenancy Act 1949 the pre-emption case was not maintainable.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">5. As it appears the High Court Division Rafinul Islam. Assar Ali and Rejaul Kabir are co-sharers in the ten­ancy by inheritance and the disputed deed was executed in their favour on 4.4.95, so because of the provisions of clause (a) of sub-section II of section 24 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949 the pre­emption case is not maintainable and so the trial court committed error in holding that <strong>“</strong><strong>বুনিয়াদী শরীকের বিরুদ্ধে প্রিয়েম্পশন দায়েরের ক্ষেত্রে কোন বাধা নাই” </strong>and so the appellate court rightly reversed the judgment of the trial court on the ground of maintainabili­ty of the pre-emption application. In the case of <strong><em>S. M. Basiruddin vs. Zahurul Islam Chowdhury and another </em></strong>reported in<strong><em> 35 DLR (AD) 230</em></strong> it has been held that the provision of pre-emption as contains in clause (a) of sub section II of section 24 of Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949 shall not apply to transfer to a co-sharer in the tenancy whose existing interest has accrued otherwise than by purchase and that transfer of portion or share of the non-agricultural land' to a stranger opens right of pre-emption to one or more co-sharer tenants of such land but when a portion or share of non-agricultural land is trans­ferred to a co-sharer in the tenancy, this is protected.<br/> </div>6. As it appears the High Court Division on proper consideration of the materials on record and applying the correct princi­ple of law as applicable in the present case, arrived at a correct decision and there is no cogent reason to interfere with the same.<br/><br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.<br/>                       </div></div>
