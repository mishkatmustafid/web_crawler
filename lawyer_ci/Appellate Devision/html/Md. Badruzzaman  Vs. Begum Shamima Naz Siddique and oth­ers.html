One Khairunnessa was the sole defendant in the suit which was for declaration of title. She entered appearance and filed a written statement. On 20 July 1985 one Nurul Islam filed an application for recording abatement of the suit informing that Khairunnessa had died on 28 December 1983. This application was reject­ed on 29 August 1985 as not maintainable because Nurul Islam was not a party to the suit. On 17 November 1985 the plaintiff made an application praying for amendment of the plaint by way of substitution of the Government of Bangladesh represented by the Deputy Commissioner, Bogra in place of the deceased defendant as she had left no heir at her death. The learned Assistant Judge asked for the death certificate of the deceased which the plaintiff could not produce. On 22 December, 1985 the learned Assistant Judge passed an order record­ing abatement of the suit for failure of the plain­tiff to bring the heirs of the deceased defendant on record within 90 days of her death on 28 December 1983 on the basis of the certificate of the Pourashava Chairman and the Sanitary Inspector filed along with the application of Nurul Islam. On 6 January 1986 the plaintiff filed an application under Order 22 Rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, hereinafter referred to as the Code, for setting aside the abatement. The application gave rise to Miscellaneous Case No. 2 of 1986. The Government of Bangladesh represented by the Deputy Commissioner, Bogra was impleaded as the opposite party therein. But there was no appearance from their side. After a number of adjournments the learned Assistant Judge on 2 May 1987 examined the plaintiff and deferred the order till 2 July 1987. In the meantime on 16 June 1987 Begum Shamima Naz Siddique (the respondent) wife of the aforesaid Nurul Islam came up with an application under Order 1 Rule 10 of the Code for being added as a party as a transferee in respect of the property in suit. On 13 August 1987 the learned Assistant Judge passed an order restoring the suit to its file and number after setting aside the order recording abatement on 22 December 1985. He also ordered that the application under Order 1 Rule 10 filed by Begum Shamima Naz Siddique be put up in due course.<br/><br/>3. Thereupon Begum Shamima Naz Siddique preferred Civil Revision No. 123 of 1988 (252/1988) to the High Court Division challenging the legality of the said order. A learned Single Judge of the High Court Division, by the impugned judgment and order, made the Rule absolute and set aside the order of the learned Assistant Judge made on 13 August 1987 maintaining the order of abate­ment dated 22 December 1985. The learned Judge held <em>inter alia</em> that the application for set­ting aside the abatement was filed 7 months after the order and that the application for addi­tion of Begum Shamima Naz Siddique was dis­missed by the learned Assistant Judge. Furthermore Khairnurnessa had left behind a daughter Zubaida Sultanan by name.<br/><br/>4. Leave to appeal was granted to consider whether the aforesaid assumptions of the learned Single Judge were correct and whether his judgment and order were sustainable.<br/><br/>5. Mr.  M.  A. Wahab Mia, the learned Advocate for the appellant submits that the learned Judge of the High Court Division mis­conceived the facts of the case and the order of the learned Assistant Judge and wrongly set aside the same. The application for setting aside the abatement was filed within 14 days of the order recording abatement but the High Court Division erroneously found that the application was filed after 7 months. Furthermore the High Court Division failed to notice that the applica­tion of the respondent for her addition had not been dismissed by the learned Assistant Judge but was ordered to be put up in the suit itself after restoration. The learned Advocate also submits that it was never agitated before the trial Court that Khairunnessa was survived by a daughter Jubaida Sultana and so the revisional court could not presume the existence of such a daughter of Khairunnessa. Finally the learned Advocate submits that the learned Single Judge had passed the impugned judgment by not applying his judicial mind to the materials on record.<br/><br/>6. Respondent No. 1 entered appearance in the appeal but filed no concise statement. As a result she is not entitled to any hearing by the Court.<br/><br/>7. On scrutiny of the records we find that the application for setting aside the abatement was made only after 14 days and not 7 months of the order recording abatement as opined by the learned Single Judge. We also find that the application by the respondent under Order 1 Rule 10 of the Code has not yet been disposed of. It is also a fact that the alleged existence of a daughter of Khairunnessa was canvassed for the first time before he High Court Division and that also without any support of evidence. Again all throughout haziras were filed before the trial court on behalf of the deceased defen­dant Khairunnessa till 20 July 1985 when Nurul Islam made an application disclosing her death. It is obvious that the plaintiff had no inkling of the death of Khairunnessa till 20 July 1985. It is only in or about the middle of November, 1985 that the plaintiff seems to have the definite knowledge of the death of Khairunnessa without leaving any heir behind. He then came up with an application on 17 November 1985 praying for amendment of the plaint by way of substi­tuting the Government for Khairunnessa. The learned Assistant Judge, however passed an order on 22 December 1985 recording of abate­ment of the suit. The plaintiff made the applica­tion for setting aside the abatement after the order was passed on 22 December 1985 which is within 14 days of the order. The learned Judge of the High Court Division completely overlooked these facts and set aside the order of the learned Assistant Judge dated 13 August 1987. The learned Single Judge laid unneces­sary stress upon certain averments in the written statement which were only matters of contest between the parties at the trial and had no bear­ing upon the abatement. In our opinion the impugned judgment of the High Court Division is a produced of non application of judicial mind and suffers from patent illegality.<br/><br/>8. In the result, this appeal is allowed with­out any order as to costs, it is further ordered that the impugned, judgment and order of the High Court Division be set aside and the order of the learned Assistant Judge dated 13 August 1987 in Miscellaneous Case No. 2 of 1986 be restored.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
