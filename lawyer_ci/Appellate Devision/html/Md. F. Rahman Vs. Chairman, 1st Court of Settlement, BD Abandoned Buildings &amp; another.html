Ruhul Amin J. -</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment dated March 16, 2003 of a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 2331 of 1994 discharging the Rule obtained im­pugning the judgment and order dated Sep­tember 29, 1994 of the 1st Court of Settlement, Dhaka in Case No.145 of 1989 (kha-129), in respect of the House No. E/2,3rd Colony, Mirpur/Dhaka dismissing the same and thereby maintaining the listing of the property in question as abandoned property. It may be mentioned the property has been listed in the 'kha' list of the abandoned property.<br/><br/>2. The facts, in short, are that property in question was allotted to one Asgar Ali, who was a refugee from India, in 1958, that Asgar Ali paid major part of consideration money and the last installment was paid by Asgar Ali's brother Akbar Ali on October 10,1979 and said Akbar Ali inherited the property in question and sold the same to Mrs. Moriam Begum by the sale deed dated December 21, 1979, that said Moriam Begum while in possession sold the property in question to Mrs. Nazma Begum by the deed dated November 17,1980 and said Nazma Begum after lapse of 4 years from the date of her purchase sold the property in ques­tion to the petitioner herein by the registered deed dated June 10, 1984 and handed over possession, It is the case of the petitioner that he got his name mutated and paid rent, that he also paid ground rent and Municipal Taxes, that Asgar Ali’s brother Akbar Ali obtained a succession certificate as proof of his being the sole heir of Asgar Ali, that a notice was issued to the petitioner to appear before the Magis­trate and to produce papers in support of his claim of the property and the petitioner appeared in November, 1985 before the autho­rity and showed the paper in support of his claim of the property and the authority was satisfied about the claim of the petitioner and in that background no notice was issued to the petitioner to surrender possession of the pro­perty in question, that petitioner was surprised to see that the property in question has been listed in the 'Kha' list as per provision of Ordinance No. 54 of 1985 and thereupon he represented to the authority seeking release of the property from the list of abandoned proper­ties but without any result and thereupon, the petitioner moved the 1st Court of Settlement but there also he did not have the desired result. In the afore state of the matter, the writ petition was filed questioning the legality of the judgment dated September 29,1994 of the 1st Court of Settlement, Dhaka.<br/><br/>3. It was the contention of the petitioner that allottee Asgar Ali was very much in Ban­gladesh at all material times and that he died in Bangladesh and that his name was listed in the voter list prepared at different times and even after liberation of Bangladesh and, as such, listing of the property as abandoned pro­perty is illegal,<br/><br/>4. The Rule obtained in the aforemen­tioned writ petition was contested by the res­pondent No.2 i.e. Government of Bangladesh, stating, inter alia, that the papers, particularly burial certificate, is a fabricated and manufac­tured paper and that the voter list does not reflect the correct state of the matter, It was the definite case of the respondent that during the war of liberation allottee left the then East Pak­istan and after liberation of Bangladesh he was not present in Bangladesh, that the affidavit of Akbar Ali claiming to be brother of Asgar Ali is a manufactured paper and has been brought into existence to grab the property in question, that at the time of promulgation of President's Order 16 of 1972 whereabouts of Asgar Ali were not known and that the property was not supervised or managed by him.<br/><br/>5. It may be mentioned the Court of Settle­ment dismissed the case on the finding that the claimant of the property failed to prove who was in possession of the property in question during the war of liberation and after emer­gence of Bangladesh and that at the time of pro­mulgation of President's Order 16 of 1972 and the petitioner also failed to prove that Asgar Ali was in possession of the property while President's Order 16 of 1972 came into force and that by Akbar Ali till the date of transfer by him in 1979.<br/><br/>6. It may be mentioned the claimant of the property could not produce original papers relating to the property in question i.e. the lease deed between Asgar Ali and the Government, nor the petitioner produced before the Court any bills showing payment of utility rates and taxes by Asgar All from February 28, 1972 till 1979 when Akbar Ali is said to have transferred the land to Mrs. Moriam Begum. It may also be mentioned no material was placed before the Court of Settle­ment to establish that Asgar Ali had a brother by name Akbar Ali. The High Court Division also noticed the finding of the Court of Settlement that claimant of the property could not prove or establish that Asgar Ali during the war of liberation was in the country and that after emergence of Bangladesh was living in Bangladesh and that Asgar Ali died in Bangla­desh. It may be mentioned the claimant of the property in support of his contention that Asgar Ali died in Bangladesh produced a burial certificate from a private agency In our view, the Court of Settlement was quite correct in not taking the said burial certificate into con­sideration since the same was not issued by a person authorised by law to issue said kind of certificate. In that state of the matter the contention of the petitioner that Asgar Ali was present in Bangladesh after emergence of Ban­gladesh and that on February 28, 1972 he was very much in Bangladesh did remain unestablished.<br/><br/>7. It was the contention of the petitioner that the property in question has been listed in the 'Kha' list without serving any notice as provided by the provision of the Ordinance No. 54 of 1985. The contention so made even if accepted as correct that would be of no useful purpose to the petitioner since the law is Set­tled now that if a particular property assumes the character of abandoned property, whether the same listed in the 'Kha' list without service of the notice is not material since in spite of listing of the property without serving notice in the 'Kha' list the property does not cease to be an abandoned property. The Court of Settlement on consideration of the materials brought before the said Court arrived at the definite finding that the claimant of the property miserably failed to establish that when President's Order 16 of 1972 was promul­gated whereabouts of Asgar Ali were known and that he or Akbar Ali did manage the property or occupy the property at the time of transfer in 1979. The finding so made by the Court of Settlement being the finding of fact, the High Court Division while exercising its power of certiorari, the said Division in the absence of mis-reading or non-consideration of the materials or misconstruing the docu­ment by the Tribunal, herein Court of Settle­ment, in arriving at a finding of a fact is not competent to interfere with the said finding of fact In the instant case, the finding of fact arrived at by the Court of Settlement having not been shown as arbitrary or that product of mis-reading or non-consideration of the materials on record or that on misconstruction of document or that contrary to the materials on record we are of the view that the High Court Division was quite correct in not inter­fering with the finding of fact made by the Court of Settlement and thereupon discharg­ing the Rule.<br/><br/>8. We have heard the learned Counsel and perused the materials on record. The lear­ned Counsel tried to make out a case in support of the prayer for leave to appeal referring to the burial certificate and some other papers which are subsequent to 1979. We have already mentioned about the relevancy of the burial certificate as an evidence in determining the question of whereabouts of Asgar Ali after the emergence of Bangladesh as well as to management of the property in question by Asgar Ali or fey Akbar Ali till the date of transfer made by him in 1979. Since the Court of fact on due consideration of the materials placed before it held that claimant of the pro­perty failed to establish that whereabouts of Asgar Ali, the owner, were known after emer­gence of Bangladesh, particularly on February 28, 1972 when President's Order 16 of 1972 was promulgated, was not established and that said Asgar Ali managed, supervised and possessed the property in question after emergence of Bangladesh and that by Akbar Ali till 1979. We are of the view that the High Court Division was not in error in discharging the Rule obtained challenging legality of the judgment of the Court of Settlement dismissing the case filed seeking release of the property from the list of the abandoned property.<br/>In the background of the discussion made hereinabove we find no substance in the petition.<br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
