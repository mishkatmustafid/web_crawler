The facts of the case in short are that the admitted owner of the suit property was one Jobbar Sarder. He transferred it in favour of the father of the plaintiff by a <em>saf kabala</em> deed No. 37155 dated 11.06.1979 and handed over possession of the same in his favour. But suddenly on 28.08.1996, Alauddin Sarder, the father of the defen­dant Nos.1 to 3, gave out that he is the owner of the suit property by virtue of a registered <em>Heba-bil-Ewaz</em> executed by one Shajahan, son of Jabbar Sarder, in his favour.<br/><br/>3. As such, the petitioner filed a suit being the Title Suit No.37 of 1996, in the Court of Assistant Judge, Louhajong, Munishiganj, praying for a decree for can­cellation of the <em>Heba-bil-Ewaz</em> deed being the Deed No.880 dated 03.04.1978. The respondent Nos.1 to 3 contested the suit by fling a written statement denying all mate­rial averments made in the plaint. The Trial Court, after hearing, dismissed the suit by his judgment and decree dated 31.03.1998. On appeal, the learned Subordinate Judge, Munshiganj, allowed the appeal and decreed the suit by his judgment and decree dated 24.03.1999. Being aggrieved, the defendant Nos.1 to 3, preferred the Civil Revision No.371 of 2000 in the High Court Division.<br/><br/>4. The High Court Division found that no documentary evidence was filed from either side. From the oral evidence on record he found that Abdul Jabbar died prior to 1979 and his son Shajahan Sarder got the suit-land by way of oral gift from other heirs of Abdul Jabbar and trans­ferred the same in favour of the defen­dants in 1978. With these findings, the High Court Division <em>set-aside</em> the judg­ment and decree of the Appellate Court and made the Rule absolute and dismissed the suit.<br/><br/>5. Mr. Awlad Ali, Senior Advocate, appears on behalf of the petitioner. He submits  that the High Court Division wrongly observed that no documentary evidence was filed from either side but as a matter of fact the certified copy of kabala deed dated 11.06.1979 was pro­duced before the Trial Court and was marked as Exhibit-1 without any objec­tion. Besides, referring to the petition, he submits that the petitioner proved the pur­chase by his father in 1979, by calling the relevant volume from the office of the concerned Sub-registrar which was marked as Exhibit-3. That the certified copy of the Deed of <em>Heba-bil-Ewaz</em> dated 03.04.1978, produced on behalf of the defendants and was exhibited but these exhibited documents were not considered by the High Court Division, rather, erred in law in deciding the matter only on oral evidence, which, he submits, requires to be examined by this Division.<br/><br/>6. The above submissions advanced by the learned Advocate for the petitioner have got substance and calls for consideration. As such, leave is granted on the above submissions raised by him.<br/><br/>7. Security of Tk.1000/- is to be deposited within 1 (one) month.<br/>Preparation of the paper-book is dis­pensed with as prayed for.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
