Ruhul Amin J.- </strong>This appeal, by leave, is by the plaintiff against the judgment and order dated February 19, 1998 of a Single Bench of the High Court Division on Civil Revision No. 577 of 1991 reversing the judg­ment and decree dated January 31, 1991 of the Court of Subordinate Judge, Nature, in Title appeal No.124 of 1989 decreeing the Suit upon reversing the judgment and decree dated may 30, 1989 of the Court of Assistant Judge, Sadar, Nature, in other Class Suit No.112 of 1979 dis­missing the same. The Suit was filed seeking declaration of title in and recovery of posses­sion of 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> decimals of land, shown in the sketch map attached to the plaint, part of 22 decimals of land of the 'kha' schedule with is part of the land of 'ka' schedule.<br/><br/>2. Plaintiff appellant filed the suit stating that 45 decimals of land described in 'ka' schedule which comprises also the land of 'kha' schedule belonged to Yakub Ali and he sold the same to his son Ishaque on May 12, 1977 who while in possession of the land of 'ka' schedule sold the same to the plaintiff on December 1, 1977. Plaintiff's Cases is that land in suit is of plot No.1063 (old plot No.1330) as des scribed in the 'kha' schedule. The plaintiff out of the said land has prayed for recovery of possession of 4½ decimals of land possessed by the defen­dant, respondent here in. It is the case of the appellant that at the time of purchase he requested the Respondent to vacate the said 4½ decimals of land by removing the structures there in and he initially agreed to vacate the land, but later on did not.<br/><br/>3. Defendant Respondent contested the suit stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that land of 'kha' schedule belonged to his father Yakub Ali and that he was allowed by his father to stay in the land in suit and thereupon he is possessing the land by erecting huts. It was also the cases of the defen­dant respondent that plaintiff's vendor Ishaque never possessed the land in Suit.<br/><br/>4. Initially by the judgment and decree dated December 30, 1981 the suit was dis­missed by the trial court on the finding the defendant has been possessing the land in suit with the permission of his father Yakub Ali and the Kabala executed by Yakub Ali in favour of his son Ishaque was not acted upon and the plaintiff failed to prove exclusive title and pos­session of his vendor, On appeal, Title Appeal No. 98 of 1984 , the judgment and decree of the trial Court was set aside and the case was sent back on remand to the trial Court with the dis­cretion to the plaintiff to amend the plaint suit­ably to convert the suit to a suit for partition for enabling the plaintiff to get some relief in the suit. The appellate court found that defendant and his brother Ishaque had inherited the land in suit from their father Yakub Ali and in case the deed of Ishaque in favour of the plaintiff if not valid in respect of entire land so sold, even then the said kabala may be valid to the extent of share of Ishaque inherited from his father.<br/><br/>5. After the remand the trial Court dis­missed the suit holding that plaintiff is entitled to 13 decimals of land which his vendor Ishaque was entitled out the land in suit, that the suit was not maintainable since no prayer for partition was made as per direction of the appel­late court made in remanding back the suit.<br/><br/>6. On appeal the suit was decreed. The appellate court decreed the suit on the finding that kabala executed by Yakub Ali in favour of his son Ishaque was acted upon and that defen­dant is in possession of the land measuring 4½ decimals in pursuance of permission from his father yakub Ali and Yakub Ali was alive till 1977 and as such there is no scope to consider the kabalas executed both by Yakub Ali and Ishaque are fraudulent.<br/><br/>7. The defendant moved the High Court Division in revision jurisdiction. The High Court Division set aside the judgment of the appellate Court upon making the Rule absolute and restored the judgment and decree of the trial Court on the finding that plaintiff did not amend the plaint in compliance with the direc­tion of the appellate court and the plaintiff did not amend the plaint suitable to a suit for parti­tion as was directed by the appellate court by the judgment and order dated January 1, 1986 made in title appeal No. 98 of 1984 and as such as the trial court dismissed the suit quite cor­rectly the appellate court without reversing the finding of the trial court in that respect was in error in decreeing the suit.<br/><br/>8. Leave was granted to consider the sub­missions that the lower appellate court as arrived at a clear finding as to the title of the plaintiff on consideration of the evidence, both oral and documentary, and also as arrived at a finding that defendant No.1 has no claim in the land in dispute other than being a lisencee from his father on the same and as such liable to be evicted by the plaintiff from the suit land, the learned Judge of the High Court Division was in error in not taking into consideration the aforesaid findings of the appellate court while reversing the judgment of the said court, that the learned Judge of the High Court Division was in error in making the rule absolute only on a consideration that the plaintiff did not comply with the order earlier passed by the lower appel­late court while sending the suit back on remand.<br/><br/>9. The undisputed position is that land measuring 45 decimals described in the 'ka' schedule belonged to Yakub Ali. He sold the same in March 12, 1977 to his son Ishaque who sold said 45 decimals of land to the plaintiff appellant on December 1, 1977. Since defendant was in occupation of 4½ decimals of land, shown in the sketch map attached to the plaint, part of 22 decimals of land of plot No.1063 (new), 1330 (old), fully described in 'kha' schedule and the defendant having not surren­dered possession in favour of the plaintiff in fulfillment of his earlier commitment, as assert­ed by the plaintiff he filed the suit for recover of possession of 4½ decimals of land. The cases of the defendant was that his father allowed him to stay in the land in respect where of the decree for declaration of title and recovery of khas pos­session has been prayed by the plaintiff and he is possessing the land by erecting hut. It was also his case that the kabala executed and regis­tered by Yakub Ali in favour of his son Ishaque was not acted upon. It may be mentioned while plaintiff filed the suit seeking declaration of title and recovery of khas possession Yakub Ali had died. The suit initially was dismissed by me trial Court as stated hereinbefore and on appeal the Court upon allowing the appeal remanded the suit back to the trial court with the direction to the plaintiff to amend the plaint suitably to a suit for partition.<br/><br/>10. The trial Court against dismissed the suit on the finding that out of the suit land the plaintiff is entitled to 13 decimals of land to which his vendor Ishaque was entitled and fur­ther held that the suit was not maintainable since no prayer for partition was made upon making necessary amendment of the plaint suit­able to a suit for partition as was directed by the appellate court. Thereupon the appellant filed an appeal and the appellate court decreed the suit on the finding that the kabala executed by Yakub Ali in favour of his son Ishaque was acted upon and the defendant is in possession of the land in suit i.e. 4½ decimals of land in pur­suance of the permission of his father and Yakub Ali was alive till 1977 and as such there is no scope to say that the kabala executed and registered by Yakub Ali and Ishaue are fraudu­lent. As against the judgment of the appellate court the defendant moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and the High Court Division set aside the judgment of the lower appellate court on the ground that the plaintiff appellant did not comply with the direction of the lower appellate court to amend the plaint suitably to a suit for partition.<br/><br/>11. The learned Counsel for the appellant submits that the lower appellate court on the basis of the evidence, both oral and documen­tary, held that by the kabala of March, 1977 Yakub Ali transferred his entire land measuring 45 decimals in favour of his son Ishaque and said kabala was acted upon and the lower appel­late court also held since Yakub Ali was alive till 1977 as such the Kabala Executed by Yakub Ali in favour of his son Ishaque and the kabala executed by Ishaque in favour of the plaintiff cannot be considered fraudulent. It is seen from the judgment of the trial court that the said court dismissed the suit primarily on the considera­tion that the plaintiff appellant did not amend the plaint suitably to a suit for partition as was directed by the appellate Court while remanding the suit back to the trial court and the kabala executed by Yakub Ali in favour of his son Ishaque was not acted upon and consequently plaintiff was entitled to 13 decimals of land which Ishaque inherited from his father. No material was brought on record from the side of the defendant to establish the cases as found by the trial Court that the kabala executed by Yakub Ali in favour of his son Ishaque was not acted upon and consequently the finding of the trial court that Ishaque has acquired interest to the extent of 13 decimals of land in his father's property measuring 45 decimals and as such plaintiff is entitled to the said quantity of land is based on no material. It has further been sub­mitted by the learned Counsel that Yakub Ali transferred the entire quantity of land measur­ing 45 decimals to his son Ishaque and there after he transferred the land so got from his father to the plaintiff and there being no materi­al that the Kabala executed by Yakub Ali in favour of his son Ishaque was not acted upon, as such direction for amending the plaint suitable to a suit for partition as was made by the appel­late court made in title Appeal No. 98 of 1984 was apparently and error and as such non com­pliance there of in no way disentitled the appel­lant from having a decree as prayed for, if the same is available on the materials on record, Since on the materials on recorded the plaintiff was found to be entitled to a decree sought for in the suit and the same having been passed by the lower appellate court the High court Division and the trial court were in error in dis­missing the suit merely on the ground that plaintiff did not comply with the direction of the lower appellate Court made in Title Appeal No.98 of 1984 to amend the plaint suitably to a suit for partition. In the background of the mate­rials on recorded it is seen that the appellate court was in serious error while made the order of remand in Title Appeal No.98 of 1984 directing the plaintiff to amend the plaint suit­ably to a suit for partition since Yakub Ali exhausted his entire interest in the land as described in the 'ka' schedule part of which has been described in 'kha' schedule by the kabala of March 1977 and as such there was no scope or occasion for Ishaque or the defendant to inherit any land on the death of Yakub Ali and also there is no occasion for seeking partition of the land of the 'ka' schedule part of which as has been described in 'kha' schedule since par­tition is sought against the co sharers, but Ishaque and the defendant, both sons of Yakub Ali were not the Co-sharers of the land as described in the 'ka' schedule as well as in the 'kha' shcedule.<br/><br/>12. It has been submitted on behalf of the Respondent while supporting the judgment of the High court Division that High Court Division did not commit any error in restoring the judgment of the trial Court upon reversing the judgment of the appellate court since direc­tion of the appellate court as was made in Title Appeal No. 98 of 1984 to amend the plaint was not complied with. We have already found that the direction to amend the plaint made by the appellate court was totally an erroneous one and in that view of the matter we are of the view that non compliance of the said direction did in no way disentitled the appellant in having the relief sought for in the suit as allowed by the appellate court in title Appeal No. 124 of 1989. The High Court Division was in serious error in setting aside the judgment of the appellate court since the said court on the basis of the materials on record found that the relief's prayed for are very much available to the plaintiff without amending the plaint suitably to a suit for parti­tion as was directed by the appellate court in its judgment passed in Title Appeal No. 98 of 1984. In our view while on the basis of the materials as are on the record the relief as prayed for can very much be given to the plaintiff then for mere non compliance of the direction of the appellate court while, at one time, sending the suit back on remand to the trial court directing the plaintiff to amend the necessary amendment in the plaint seeking relief of different nature from the relief prayed for by the plaintiff appar­ently erroneous then the Court is quite compe­tent to grant the relief sought for by the plaintiff inspite of non compliance of the direction of the Court to amend the plaint for enabling him to a different relief and thereupon to decree the suit instead of dismissing the suit for non compli­ance of the direction of the court which was otherwise erroneous. The plaintiff appellant filed the suit seeking declaration of title and recovery of possession in respect of 4½ deci­mals of land out of 22 decimals of land as described in the 'kha' schedule of the plaint. The said 22 decimals of land is part of the 45 decimals of land as described in 'ka' schedule. The appellate court on due consideration of the evidence on record held acquisition of title by the plaintiff from Ishaque who got the same from Yakub All is quite valid and the defendant as was a mere lisencee of Yakub Ali and as such on the asking of the appellant he was to surrender possession in favour of the appellant and having not had surrendered possession the plaintiff sought for the relief's in the suit as mentioned hereinbefore. The High Court Division set aside the judgment and decree of the appellate court only on the ground plaintiff did not comply with the direction of the appel­late court as was made in title Appeal No. 98 of 1984 to amend the plaint suitably to a suit for partition and restored the judgment of the trial court dismissing the suit. The lower Appellate court on consideration of the evidence, both oral and documentary, has found title of the plaintiff in the land in suit and also has held that the defendant was a mere license of his father in the land in suit. It was the contention of the defendant that the kabala executed by Yakub Ali in favour of his son Ishaque was not acted upon. The lower appellate court in the back­ground of the facts as well as on the basis of the evidence held that the kabala executed by Yakub Ali in favour of Ishaque was acted upon. The High Court Division has not disturbed the findings so arrived at by the appellate court in decreeing the suit. The learned Advocate on record for the Respondent could also not point out any infirmity in the findings of the appellate court on the basis where of decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiff.<br/>In the background of the discussions made hereinabove we find merit in this appeal.<br/>Accordingly the appeal is allowed.<br/>Accordingly Judgment of the High Court Division is set aside and the judgment and decree of the appellate court is restored.<br/>There is no order as to costs.<br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
