In the present case in a hot haste an <em>ex parte</em> decree was obtained which indicates that a fraud was committed upon the court as well as upon the defendants and when a fraud is proved then there is no question of limitation and time will run from the date when the fraud is detected and so the question of limitation does not arise in the present case; even if, for argument's sake, it is conceded that the fraud was detected earlier, even then the Court is not debarred to interfere under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure.  … (5)</strong></div> <br/><strong>Cases Referred to:</strong><br/>Abul Khair Mia vs. Abdul Latif Sardar, 32 DLR (AD) 167; Mofazzal Molla and another vs. Parul Bala Debi and others, 24 DLR 78 Mozaffar Ahmed and others vs. Moulvi Salah Ahmed and others, 40 DLR 239; Amir Hossain Sardar vs. Sarat Chandra and others, 31 DLR 109 and Master Abdul Aziz vs. Abani Mohan Mukherjee and others, 30 DLR (AD) 221.<br/><br/><strong><em>Lawyers Involved:</em></strong><br/><em>Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan, Senior Advocate, instructed by Sajjadul Huq, Advocate-on-Record - For the Appellant</em><br/><em>Mozaffer Hossain, Senior Advocate, instructed by Md.

Tafazzul Islam J.- </strong>This appeal by leave has arisen out of the judgment and order dated 4-7-1994 passed by the High Court Division in First Miscellaneous Appeal No.696 of 1991 allowing the appeal upon setting aside judgment and order dated 26-8-1991 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Bogra in Miscellaneous Case No.13 of 1987 by which the <em>ex parte</em> judgment and decree dated 13-3-1986 passed in Other Class Suit No. 46 of 1986 was set aside and thereby the above suit was restored to its original file and number.<br/><br/>2. The appellant instituted the above suit for specific performance of contract and on obtaining <em>ex parte</em> decree dated 10-3-1986 got a sale deed executed and registered in his favour through Court in Other Class Execution Case No. 6 of 1986; subsequently, the defendant No.1 filed Miscellaneous Case No. 13 of 1987 under Order IX, rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure for setting aside the above <em>ex parte</em> decree on the grounds that the summons was not served upon her and that on 19-6-1985, i.e. before service of summons, she left Bangla­desh for her father's residence at Peshawar in Pakistan and her husband, defendant No. 2, was untraceable since December, 1985. The plaintiff contested the above miscellaneous case asserting that summons were duly served upon the defendants and the notices were also sent upon the defendants by registered post which being refused by the defendants, according to law, were deemed to have been served upon the defendants. The learned Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Bogra dismissed the above miscellaneous case on the findings, <em>inter alia</em>, that Ext 'Ka' series show that the summons of the suit were duly served upon the defendants through process server and OPW No. 3, the attesting witness, proved service of summons while the defendants failed to prove that no summons were served upon them and moreover, the defendants did not challenge the service of sum­mons which were sent through registered post and sending of summons through registered post has got strong legal presumption of service under section 27 of the General Clauses Act; it is an admitted fact that the husband of the defendant No.1 some time in the year 1985 took shelter in the residence of his brother Md. Rafiq Khan whose residence is situated at Sutrabur, Bogra Town, Bogra and therefore, the address of the defendants given in the plaint were correct address and services of summons were made in that address; the allegation of not knowing the whereabouts of Abdur Rashid Khan, the husband of the defendant No. 1, is nothing but myth and altogether disproved by evidence; the said Md. Abdur Rashid Khan was made party in the miscellaneous case as opposite party No. 3 and notices were duly served upon him through court and also by registered post and, as such, evidently he is not untraced; since the summons were evidently served upon the defendant No.1 and yet she did not appear to contest the suit, the suit was rightly decreed <em>ex parte</em>. Being aggrieved, the defendants filed the above miscellaneous appeal before the High Court Division and after hearing allowed the appeal.<br/><br/>3. Leave was granted on the submissions that the High Court Division erred in holding that the summons were not served upon defendant No.1 as there was no tender of the same upon her and that the High Court Division overlooked the provisions of rule 15 of Order V and also rule 3 of Order III of the Code of Civil Procedure, and since summons sent by registered post was also returned with the postal peon's endorsement of 'refusal' by the defendants, the High Court Division erred in holding that the said notices were not duly served.<br/><br/>4. The learned Counsel for the appellant submits that the summons having been issued on both defendant Nos.1 and 2 and the pro­cess server having served the summons on defendant No. 2 as the agent of defendant No.1 and also on the   defendant No.2 personally and the process server, the OPW No.2, also having deposed that he has served the summons on the defendants at the address written on the summons and OPW No.3, the attesting witness, having also attested the service of summons in terms of the provisions of rules 9 to 19 of Order V and rule 3 of Order III of the Code of Civil Procedure, it will be deemed that the summons were duly served and further the summons being duly sent by registered post with acknowledgment duly addressed to defendant Nos.1 and 2 in accordance with the provisions laid down in rule 19B, Order V Code of Civil Procedure and said summons having been returned with the endorsement made by the postal peon as being 'refused', there was also proper service of the summons sent by registered post   and therefore, the High Court Division committed error in holding that the provision of rule 19B of Order V has not been complied with.<br/><br/>5. As it appears the High Court Division found that to prove the service of summons the plaintiff examined OPW No.2, the process-server and the OPW No.3, the  attesting witness, and as is evident from the report of the process server, he went to the residence of the defendant No.1 and when the husband of defendant No.1 refused to accept the summons it was served by hanging but the contents of the summons show that the process server was directed to cause service of summons on two defendants, the defendant No.1 as well as the defendant No. 2, her husband, but the service return does not indicate that the process server attempted to cause service of summons on defendant No. 2; the process server, while deposing as OPW 2, in his examination-in-chief, stated that he has served the summons on the defendants but did not state on oath that he tried to serve the summons on both the defendants and when they refused to accept the same those were served by hanging; further, the process server is also completely silent on the mode of service of summons or attempted service of summons on defendant No.2 and if his evidence is considered it would appear that the summons were served only on the defendant No.1 though, as a matter of fact, there were two defendants; moreover, OPW 3, the attesting witness, on service of summons, in his examination-in-chief stated that the process server served the summons upon Abdur Rashid Khan, the defendant No. 2 in his presence but this OPW No. 3 did not state a single word on the service of summons on defendant No. 1 and though the records show that after the receipt of the return the trial Court fixed a date for <em>ex parte</em> disposal but before fixing the date, the trial Court has not looked into the service return; the records of the trial Court does not show that the provision of rule 19B of Order V of the Code of Civil Procedure has been complied with and even in the records there is no material showing sending of the summons by registered post with acknowledgment due and there is also nothing on record to indicate that the postal acknowledgment due was received by the trial Court and no step was also taken by the respondent to examine the postal peon to prove the service of summons which was sent by registered post with A/D; in the case of <strong><em>Abul Khair Mia vs. Abdul Latif Sardar</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>32 DLR (AD) 167</em></strong> it has been held that an <em>ex parte</em> decree obtained by suppressing sum­mons is a decree obtained fraudulently and, as such, nullity and the decree, which has been questioned in the present miscellaneous appeal, is a nullity; in the present case in a hot haste an <em>ex parte</em> decree was obtained which indicates that a fraud was committed upon the court as well as upon the defendants and in <strong><em>32 DLR (AD) 167</em></strong> as referred above the Appellate Division also held that when a fraud is proved then there is no question of limitation and time will run from the date when the fraud is detected and so the question of limitation does not arise in the present case; even if, for argument's sake, it is conceded that the fraud was detected earlier, even then the Court is not debarred to interfere under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure and in the case of <strong><em>Mofazzal Molla and another vs. Parul Bala Debi and others</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>24 DLR 78</em></strong> it has been held been that in a case where fraud is committed upon the Court as well as upon the party, a Court has inherent jurisdiction to interfere in the matter in exercising its power vested in section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure and similar view has also been expressed in the case of <strong><em>Mozaffar Ahmed and others vs. Moulvi Salah Ahmed and others</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>40 DLR 239</em></strong>; <strong><em>Amir Hossain Sardar vs. Sarat Chandra and others</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>31 DLR 109</em></strong> and <strong><em>Master Abdul Aziz vs. Abani Mohan Mukherjee and others</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>30 DLR (AD) 221</em></strong>.<br/>We are of the view that the High Court Division, on proper assessment of the materials on record and applying the principle of law as applicable in the present appeal, arrived at a correct decision and there is no cogent reason to interfere with the above decision. So, the appeal is dismissed without any order as to costs.<br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
