The respondents Nos. 1 and 2 filed Title Suit No. 200 of 1974 in the Court of Munsif, Natore for a declaration that the 4 kabalas alleged to have been executed by them on 24.5.73 in favour of the defendants appellants were hit by section 23 of the Con­tract Act and also for possession of the land.<br/><br/>3. Plaintiff's case was that the land des­cribed in schedule Ka of the plaint belonged to Haji Mohan Ali and Abdul Hoque who out of this land sold Ka schedule land to some other party in 1970 and sold the Kha schedule land to the plaintiff by executing kabala on 18.9.70 but the kabala was not presented for registration and the vendors refused to register the same when the plaintiffs presented it to the Sub-Registrar Office and got the same registered The defendant Abdul Hannan and others filed Criminal case against the plaintiff under section 144 Cr. P. C. and subsequently the proceeding was drawn up under section 145 Cr. P. C. and a receiver was appointed. The defendant Joynal Abedin brought a Criminal case against plaintiff No. 1 and his relation under section 385/148/448 and warrants were issued. Another case bro­ught against the plaintiff under section 143 and 379 B.P.C Plaintiff's further case was that a salish was held by the relations of defendants and the plaintiffs and in pursuance of the salish the plaintiff was directed to exe­cute kabala in favour of the defendant who in turn withdrew the criminal cases. Accord­ingly the kabala was executed and defendants withdrew the Criminal case. The plaintiff con­tended that the kabalas concerned in Kha schedule land were without consideration and the plaintiffs executed them in the face of pressure of the Criminal cases and they were of no effect.<br/><br/>4. The defendants contested the suit by filing a joint written statement and contended that at the intervention of the local head­men and the villagers the parties were advised to settle their dispute and in terms of the Salishnama both parties agreed to compro­mise by exchange of lands and accordingly litigations were withdrawn. The suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>5. The trial court noticed that there were "litigation between the parties” over the property which admittedly belonged to Haji Mohan Ali and Abdul Hoque. Both sides placed before the Court certain registered do­cuments though "in spite of having registered documents the defendant did not state their case" in the written statement which warran­ted a comment by the learned Munsif "Per­haps the defendants’ lawyer failed to do his duty honestly". The learned Munsif then considered the contention of the plaintiffs that the consideration of 'Gha' schedule kabalas were the compromise of a non-com­poundable criminal case. The trial court noticed that the Criminal cases had ended in compromise and then considered the salishnama Ext. F which shows:  <br/>"that a compromise between the par­ties was made on the condition that the defendants would give some lands to the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs in consi­deration of that will also give the lands of the disputed kabala". <br/>The trial court noticed that the plaintiffs have not examined any witness to give evidence that the consideration of the disputed kabala was the compounding of a non-compoundable case. Its view was that the plaintiffs failed to prove that the consideration of the suit kabala was unlawful. Accordingly the suit was dismissed.<br/><br/>6. On appeal the learned Additional Dis­trict Judge took the view that the impugned kabalas were executed by the plaintiff at a time when non-compoundable criminal case was pending against him and found that the execution of the kabala were made for the purpose of stifling a criminal case and as such it is hit by section 23 of the Contract Act because the transaction is unlawful and against the public policy. The appellate Court below noticed the Criminal proceeding under sections 380 and 148 pending against the plaintiff started by the defendants and its view was that the trial court was not justified in dismissing the suit, and accordingly the appeal was allowed and the suit was decreed dec­laring that the impugned kabalas dated 24.5.73   executed by the plaintiff in favour of the defendants as void. Reliance was placed on <strong><em>21 DLR 918 and 5 DLR 114 and 338</em></strong>.<br/><br/>7. On revision the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division noticed the material portion of Salishnama Ext. Which runs as follows:<br/> [<em>The first party Sahajuddin will make the arrangement to register 35 Bighas and 2 kathas of homestead land to the second party Rostom Ali in dhag no. 348 of the Mrichapila Mouza free of cost. Rostom Ali will bear the registration cost. The second party Rostom Ali after keeping 1 Bigha and 2 kathas of land from 7 Bighas of land which he registered from Hazi Mohon and Abdul Huq, will register the total amount of land to Sahajuddin. Sahajuddin will bear the registration cost.</em><br/><em>It is mentioned that we will give up the cases which we instituted against each other in courts and thanas after mutual submission of compromise deed. Cost will be borne by both the parties.</em><br/><em>Date- 12-5-1973</em>]<br/>The learned Judge noticed in all there were three cases pending namely (1 ) Criminal case No. 40C of 1973 under sections 145/379 (2) Criminal Case No. 207 of 1973 under sections 148/448/380 P.C. (3) Proceeding under section 145 bearing case No. 149M of 1972 It was further noticed that on 24.5.73 the plaintiff executed 4 kabalas in favour of the defendants and on the same date defendants withdrew that Criminal cases as a result the accused were discharged under section 253(2) Cr. P. C. and proceeding under sections 145 were dropped and the attached properties were released. The learned Judge posed the question: <br/>"Whether the disputed kabalas were executed in exchange of the properties of the defendants or in consideration of the compounding of some non-com­poundable criminal cases". <br/>The learned Judge kept in view the well-settled principle that it is against the public policy to make a trade of felony or com­promise an offence which is not compoundable in law and that an agreement to that effect is wholly void. He further noticed a decision of the West Pakistan High Court wherein it was held that in order to settle the dispute between the parties concerning their title to the land but 'to finish" criminal cases as well. The compromise that was arrived as was not hit by section 23 of the Contract Act. The matter went before the Supreme Court and leave was granted to consider the question being of public impor­tance but the decision of the Supreme Court could not be traced in the subsequent volume of P.L.D. though the leave order in that case was published in <strong><em>1968 SC M.R. 1313</em></strong> (in the case of <strong><em>Md. Isha Khan Vs. Md. Jahan Khan)</em></strong>.<br/><br/>8. The learned Judge then observed that there was no evidence of dispute and repelled the contention that the compromise was in fact for exchange of property between the parties. It was concluded:<br/>It appears that the plaintiff had to pay a price for withdrawal of some non-compoundable criminal case hanging over then heads and that the suit lands, of which they were the undisputed owners, were brought in the bargain. Such agreements, without there being any previous history of bonafide civil dis­putes, cannot be hit by section 23 of the Contract Act".<br/><br/>9. Notwithstanding the above obser­vation the learned Judge noticed that a kabala was also executed by the defendants in favour of the plaintiffs and observed that the defendant themselves will be  within their right to cancel the document obtained by the plaintiff No. 1 and his bro­ther for the same reason. In this view of matter the rule was discharged and the judg­ment and decree of the learned Additional District Judge were affirmed.<br/><br/>10. Leave was granted to consider the question whether the Salishnama Ext. F was correctly construed by the High Court Divi­sion to show that the kabala in question were hit by the provision of section 23 of the Contract Act.<br/><br/>11. It will be noticed that the plaintiff executed 4 kabalas in favour of the defen­dants arid the defendant executed one kabala in favour of the plaintiff and his brother. The terms of the kabala have been men­tioned above whereby the plaintiff had to execute the kabala for 5 bighas and odd land out of the 7 bighas land purchased from Haji Mohan and Abdul Hoque whereas the defendants had to execute a kabala for 1 bigha 2 kathas in favour of the plaintiff which is a part of their homestead land. Mr. Shaukat Ali Khan, learned Counsel argued that the teams show that this was mere exchange of properties between the parties and in consideration of the dispute over the land which originally belonged to Haji Mohan and Abdul Hoque. It is true that a Criminal proceeding under section 145. Cr. P. C. was pending being Criminal Case No. 259M of 1972 wherein proceedings were started and receiver was appointed by the Magistrate. That was a case of 1972 whereas the kabalas were executed on 24. 5.73. It is argued that the court of appeal below and the High Court Division have overlooked these aspects of the case and concentrated mere on a point namely whether any compoundable offence was compounded which was never agitated before a Criminal Court.<br/><br/>12. This contention has substance. In the Criminal Court there were two cases pending namely (1) Criminal Case No. 207 of 1973 wherein the defendant Joynal Abedin filed a Criminal case against the plaintiff under sections 38/148/448/ and the second case being Criminal case No. 40C of 1973 under sections 143/379 B P. C. against the plaintiff. It is true that both the cases were withdrawn by the prosecutor namely the defendant on the very day when the kabalas were exec­uted and in both the cases the plaintiff accused were discharged by the learned Magistrate under section 253 (2) Cr. P. C. Having sec­ured this discharge order the plaintiff now come round to say that the kabala execu­ted by him were hit by section 23 of the Contract Act as void. Nothing was said as to the effect of the kabala that was executed by the defendant in favour of the plaintiff surrendering 1 bigha 2 kathas of his homestead land.<br/><br/>13 Section 23 of the Contract Act is in the following terms:<br/>"23. What considerations and objects are lawful and what not the considera­tion or object of an agreement is lawful, unless-<br/>it is forbidden by law, of; or is  of such  a nature that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law; or is fraudulent; or Involves or implies injury to the person or property of another; or the Court regards it as immoral, or opposed to public policy. In each of these cases the consideration or object of an agreement is said to be unlawful. Every agreement of which the object or consideration is unlawful void."  <br/>The appellate Court below or the High Court Division did not specify how the kabalas are hit and by which of the provision. Presumably the view was taken that such agree­ment is forbidden by law or is of such a na­ture that, if permitted, it would defeat the provision of any law. The trial court noticed that no evidence was given nor any witness was examined to show that the consideration of the disputed kabala was a compounding of a non-compoundable case.<br/><br/>14. Section 345 Cr. P.C. lays down which of the offences should be compounded and again it is divided into two parts. Some offences can be compounded by the parties themselves and some offence can be compoun­ded with permission of the Court before which any prosecution for such offence is pending. The courts below did not specify which of the offence was non-compounding. Again in the Criminal Court this question was not raised because the plaintiffs are the accused persons and it was to their advantage not to raise the point, inasmuch as they secured their discharge from the Criminal Court. Had there been any non-compoundable offence that would have attracted the attention of the Criminal Court but since the Criminal Court passed the order of discharge obviously took the view that there was no non-compounding offence. Because sub-section (7) says that no offence can be compounded except as provi­ded by this section.<br/><br/>15. Next if there be any offence which can be compounded only with permission of the court then the legitimate inference can be drawn that the Court had permitted for the compounding of such offence.<br/><br/>16. Our Criminal Administration of Jus­tice encourages the compromise of certain disputes and even certain offence can be com­pound as provided by section 345 Cr. P.C. Shalish or compromise had been although a mode of settlement of dispute in this sub-con­tinent from time immemorial. In the Conci­liation Court Ordinance, 1961, section 3 provides for the certain offences referable to the Conciliation Court and ''no Civil or Crimi­nal Court shall have jurisdiction to try any such case and even cases falling under Part II of the Schedule may be so referred "if all  the parties thereto agree  to such a reference". Sub-section (2) provides for that in some matters Conciliation Court will have no juris­diction such as the case in which interest of minor is involved or in case of arbitration or the case against the Government "or Public Organization and clause (d) adds:  <br/>"cases which according to the custo­mary law of a community are referable to a community panchayat."  <br/>This is a legislative recognition of a settlement of a dispute by a community panchayat and sub section (3) further provides that the Go­vernment may add to the Schedule any class of cases relating to such dispute between pri­vate parties as are of "a local nature and are capable of settlement of compromise". The whole emphasis is on settlement of dispute either by Panchayet or by compromise. The same trend was maintained after repeal of the Conciliation Court by the village Court Ordi­nance. 1976 and in the Schedule section 143 figures Part I and Sections 379, 380 and 381 were also added to the list under certain cir­cumstances to be decided by the Village Court. The decision of the Village Court either by the unanimous or by majority opinion shall be enforceable and section 14 bars the appearance of a legal practitioner. The composition of the Village Court provides that two members to be nominated by each of the parties to the dispute. Thus the legislative Scheme seems to be that those offences are to be tried by Village Court and compensation can be awarded by such Court.<br/><br/>17. The pattern is clear, namely that the law encourages settlement of dispute, either by Panchayet or by Arbitration or by way of compromise and if it is a Criminal offence, the offence can be compounded within the limit of section 345 Cr. P.C. The category of offence compoundable have been enlarged by the Law Reforms Ordinance and at the mo­ment all the offences which are subject matter of Criminal Case No. 207 of 1073, 400 of 1973 e.g. offence under secs. 380/148/448/143 and 379 of the Penal Code are compoundable. The main ground of the judgment of the ap­pellate Court and the High Court Division is that some of the offences are non-compoundable offence although unfortunately none of the Courts below have specified which of the offences is non-compoundable. Insofar as the case under section 145 Cr. P.C. is concerned that was not a case involving any Criminal charge. In <strong><em>Jugadish Vs. Kausillah Devi, AIR 1947 All 317</em></strong> this point was considered and it was observed: <br/>"In could, in no sense be contrary to public policy that persons concerned in a dispute about land should settle their dispute so as to avoid any future danger of a breach of the peace. The provisions, of section 145 deal with an inquiry pri­marily into possession over property in dispute and they are of judicial nature. There is nothing in them which should cause any apprehension which would vitiate an agreement to settle the dis­putes between the parties."  <br/>In the present case the case under section 145 Cr. P. C. was started in 1972 and admit­tedly the dispute was concerning the land which originally belonged to Haji Mohon and Abdul Hoque. Such dispute is compoundable and as a matter of fact the learned Magistrate drop­ped the proceeding because he was satisfied that there was no apprehension of breach of peace.<br/><br/>18. The defendant took the stand that the village headmen and the elders pursuaded them to have compromise settling all the disputes which resulted in the Salishnama Ext. F. Accordingly the Criminal Cases were withdrawn.<br/><br/>19. In one of the oldest cases reported in <strong><em>10. Crl. L.J. page 228</em></strong> (<strong><em>Emperor Vs. Lilaram and others</em></strong>) a petition was filed in Court "that a reconciliation had been effected by the intervention of some respectable persons, and the matter had been compromised". The Magistrate refused to accept the compromise and referred to Sadar Court Building in Cri­minal Report No. 15 of 1894 whereupon the Court of Judicial Commissioner observed: <br/>“We are of the opinion however, the Court is not concerned to inquire into the nature or value of the consideration, and if, as in the present case, the com­plainant considers that his grievance is redressed, by the mere fact of respec­table persons intervening, though he has received no money payment or even a direct apology from accused, he is, nevertheless, at full liberty to compound the prosecution''. <br/>The High Court Division noticed <strong><em>21 D.L.R. (Dhaka) 918. Purnendu Kumar Das Vs. Hiran Kumar Das</em>. </strong>Mr. Shaukat Ali Khan does not contest the proposition laid in this decision. He submits that the facts of that case and the present case are completely different because here by the Salishnama parties exchanged their properties with each other. The High Court Division noticed that it is well settled that it is against the public policy to make a trade or felony or compro­mise of an offence which is not compoundable in law and that an agreement to that effect is void. As proposition of law it is not disputed but the Supreme Court of India <strong><em>1965 (SC) page 166</em></strong> in the case of <strong><em>Ouseph Poulo Vs. Catholic Union Bank</em></strong> observed:  <br/>''Where the validity of an agreement is impeached on the ground that it is opposed to public policy under section 23 of the Act, the party setting up the plea must be called upon to prove that plea by clear and satisfactory evidence."  <br/>It was observed:  <br/>"Reliance on a mere sequence of events may tend to obliterate the real difference between the motive for the agreement and the consideration for it. Did the parties offer to give security and execute the documents in consideration for the withdrawal of the Criminal com­plaint by the Bank? That is the ques­tion which has to be decided in the present appeals, and in proving their case, the plaintiffs are expected to lead satis­factory evidences; and in our opinion, the High Court is, on the whole, right when it came to the conclusion, that the evidences led by the plaintiffs is far from satisfactory. Therefore, we are satisfied that the view taken by the High Court is right and cannot be reversed".  <br/>In the present case the trial court noticed as under:  <br/>"The plaintiffs have not examined any witness to give evidence that the consideration of the disputed kabalas was the compounding of a non- compoundable case".  <br/><br/>20. In the absence of such evidence it does not appear clearly as to how the appellate Court below and the High Court Division took the view that the kabalas were hit by section 23 of the Contract Act. As has been noticed already in the Criminal Court this issue was not made and the Criminal Court did not take any exception to the petition for withdrawal of the complaint case. Understandably the accused plaintiff would not take any exception because by the withdrawal of the prosecution he had secured his discharge. Now in the second round he has assailed the kabalas by which he had to forgo his claim over 5 bighas and odd quantity of land which originally belonged to Haji Md. Mohan and Abdul Hoque. He wanted to enrich himself by assailing these kabalas without, however, saying a word as to the kabala given by the defendant wherein 1 bigha 2 kathas was sur­rendered in favour. A person in <em>pari delicto</em> cannot seek any relief before any Court of law. The complainant having secured his discharge in pursuance of the Salish which was accepted by both the parties had thought it fit to disown the Salishnama. Law does not encourage a person to take advantage of his own wrong. The Trial Court rightly dismiss­ed the suit.<br/><br/>21. Withdrawal and composition are two distinct concepts. Withdrawal is the act of the complainant whereas the composition of an offence requires the co-operation of both parties. Whether a petition is one for with­drawal or compromise, is to be judged from the fact of each case. In <strong><em>AIR 1923 All 474</em></strong> the complainant wrote out: "This is to say that Mr. John came to me and offered an unconditional apology I beg to withdraw the case against him." the document was held to mean that the offence was compounded. Though the compounding of an offence signi­fies that the person against whom the offence has been committed has received some grati­fication to act as an inducement for his desir­ing to abstain from prosecution, even an apology may be sufficient consideration for a compromise. Here, the parties exchanged their land at the intervention of the village elders and they have settled up all their diffe­rences. Such compromises are allowed by Courts and the Court is not concerned with the nature of value of the consideration. (<strong><em>AIR 1950 All 86</em></strong>).<br/><br/>22. The present case is on all fours with the case of <strong><em>Moulvi Mohammad Ismail  vs. Amad Ali, 20 CWN 948 </em></strong>where the plaintiff sued for a declaration that certain documents executed by him in favour of the defendants were invalid and void for want of considera­tion. The trial Court found that there was no coercion exercised upon the plaintiff and the suit was dismissed. On appeal, the plain­tiff appellant contended that the contracts were opposed to public policy as they were entered into for compounding a Criminal Case. The learned Subordinate Judge noticed that the plaintiff had been summoned under section 325 of the Penal Code and such offence is compoundable with the permission of the Court and the Magistrate gave permission to compound the case. Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed. In Second Appeal the Cal­cutta High Court dismissed the appeal by observing "the parties entered into a com­promise for settling their long standing disputes by executing the documents and pay­ment of money in cash", and the matter was compounded with the leave of the Court. Pre­cisely that is the position here and therefore the plaintiff cannot make a grievance to inva­lidate the documents executed by him in pursuance of a compromise.<br/>In the result, therefore this appeal is allowed. Judgment of the High Court Divi­sion and appellate Court below are set aside and that of the trial Court dismissing the suit is restored. There will be no order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
