Abdul Aziz J.-</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 17.04.2008 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 2727 of 2003 discharging the Rule and affirming the judgment and decree dated 19th May, 2003 passed by the Senior Assistant Judge, Sadar, Sylhet, in Small Cause Suit No.9 of 1999 decree­ing the same.<br/><br/>2. Facts, as placed before the High Court Division, in short, are that the respon­dent as plaintiff instituted Small Cause Suit No.9 of 1999 in the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Sadar, Sylhet, impleding the petitioners as defendants for eviction of the petitioners from the suit premises. Plaintiffs case is that the defendants were inducted as Bharatia in the suit premises on monthly rental of Tk.120/- vide agreement dated 04.08.1980 and the rent was increased to Tk.250, that it was agreed in May, 1991 that the rent would be increased and when the plaintiff wanted to increase the rent from July, 1995, defendants did not comply and the plaintiff did not take rent when the defendants tendered the rent for the month of July, 1995 and the defendant thereafter did not pay rent and became defaulter. The plaintiff finding no other alternative served a notice upon the defendant under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act terminates the agreement from 23.11.1995 and asking the defendant to vacate the suit premis­es as per agreement. The defendant after receiving the notice by the plaintiff filed the case before the Rent Control being Rent Control Case No.21 of 1995 for depositing rent in Court which was ulti­mately dismissed and against the said dismissal order the defendant preferred an appeal before the learned District Judge which is still pending. The defen­dant having not vacated the suit premis­es hence the suit.<br/><br/>3. Defendant Nos.1 and 2 contested the suit by filing a written statement, con­tending, <em>inter alia</em>, that they obtained the suit premises by a Bharatia Agreement on a rent of Tk. 120/- as monthly rent and continue to hold the premises as ten­ant. The defendants further stated in their written statements that the defen­dants gradually increased the monthly rent of Tk. 120/- to Tk.250/- till date and regularly paying the rent. Due to pres­sure by the plaintiff, the defendant had to increase the monthly rent up to Tk.250/- in the month of July, 1999 when the defendant again, sent the rent of Tk.250/- the plaintiff did not accept the rent. Thereafter, the defendant start­ed depositing rent to the rent control regularly. The plaintiff has got other six shops which have been also let out to different person and the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>4. Trial Court after hearing the case and examining the evidence on record and perusing the agreement and documents decreed the suit by his judgment and decree dated 19.05.2003.<br/><br/>5. Being aggrieved by dissatisfied with the above judgment and decree, the defendant-petitioners preferred Civil Revision No.2727 of 2003 before the High Court Division and obtained Rule. The learned Single Judge of the High Court Division upon hearing the parties discharged the Rule vide judgment and order dated 27.04.2008. Hence this leave petition by the petitioners.<br/><br/>6.  Mr. Md. Osman Ghani, the learned Advocate, appearing for the petitioners, submits that trial Court and also the High Court Division while decreeing the suit failed to appreciate that admit­tedly the defendants have been paying rent as per the existing rate and as such they are not the defaulter; but in spite of that the trial Court decreed the suit and the revisional Court without considering the vital aspect of the case affirmed the judgment and decree of the trial Court mechanically and in a slip short manner.<br/>He further submits that the High Court Division while discharging the Rule failed to consider that according to the judgment of the trial Court, the defen­dants have paid enhanced rent regularly, but the trial Court decreed the suit as the plaintiff refused to accept enhance rent of the suit premises, but in case of refusal to enhance the rent, the plaintiff has option to take resort for enhance of rent under Section 15 of the Rent Control Act, 1991 and as such the decree passed by the trial Court on the ground of non payment of standard rent as affirmed by the revisional Court is not sustainable. He also submits that revi­sional application has been filed under Section 25 of the Small Cause Courts Act, the High Court Division ought to have consider the matter with wider amplitude, but the revisional Court failed to discuss any of the grounds agi­tated by the petitioners, which is against the provisions of law. His further sub­mission is that trial Court and the High Court Division failed to appreciate that the defendants have been paying stan­dard rent of the suit premises but the Senior Assistant Judge without any basis held that the defendants were not agreeable to pay standard rent of the suit premises. Learned Advocate lastly sub­mits that the High Court Division while decreeing the suit failed to take notice that in the original agreement rent was fixed at Tk.120/- but due to plaintiffs undue pressure and insistence defen­dants were compelled to increase the rent upto Tk. 250/- but the trial Court failed to appreciate those aspect of the case and held that the rent paid by the defendants was not standard rent. The trial Court did not specify the amount which is standard rent for the suit prem­ises and as such the trial Court arrived at a wrong conclusion.<br/><br/>7. We have heard the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioners and perused the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other materials available on record.<br/><br/>8. The trial Court decreed the suit direct­ing the defendant-petitioners to vacate the suit premises within 30 days finding the defendant-petitioner as defaulters on due consideration of facts and evidence of the case both oral and documentary and holding that the plaintiff has been able to prove his case. The learned Single Judge of the High Court Division affirmed the judgment of the trial Court on discussion and consideration of the evidence and material on record of the case. The learned Single Judge having discharged the Rule on proper finding based on evidence and materials on record we find no reason to disturb the same. Hence this leave petition is dis­missed having no merit.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
