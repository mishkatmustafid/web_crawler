The respondent No.1 as writ petitioner filed a writ petition challenging Memo No. 327/2 dated 06.04.2005 issued by the respondent No.2 canceling lease of the petitioner and order contained in Memo No. 329/1 dated 11.04.2005 granting lease in favour of the respondent. The High Court Division after hearing the writ-peti­tioner issued rule and granted statue<em>-quo</em>; that the case of the writ-petitioner-respon­dent No.1, in short, is that he obtained lease of a Pathor Mohal on 17.04.2004 vide Memo No. 236/1 for collecting tolls in the name of the Union Parishad for a period of six years with a yearly rental of Tk. 1,15,000.00 and after obtaining lease he was given delivery of possession vide Memo No. 237/2 dated 17.04.2004; that after the lease he duly paid lease money for 1411 and 1412 B.S.; that during the subsistence of his lease the respondent No.2 without assigning any reason and without any prior notice vide Memo No. 327/2  dated 06.04.2005  cancelled the lease of the writ petitioner and vide Memo No. 329/1 dated 11.04.2005 granted lease in favour of the respondent No.3 petition­er and hence the writ petition.<br/><br/>3. The rule was contested by the respon­dent No.3- petitioner and respondent No.2 by filling power. Thereafter the present petitioner and respondent and respondent No.2 jointly filed application for vacating the order of status-<em>quo</em>. The case of the petitioner in short is that no lease was granted in favour of the writ petitioner in respect of case Pathor Mohal. There is no official record produced that a lease has been granted in favour of the writ-petitioner; that the document which the writ-petitioner annexed in support of his lease are all false and manufactured documents and created for the purpose of filling of the writ petition; that the present petitioner duly took lease of the Pathor Mohal for 1412 B.S. to 1414 on 30.03.2005; there-after he paid rent for 1412 B.S. on 10.04.2005 and execute lease deed on 11.04.2005 and got delivery of possession on 11.04.2005; that under the cover of statue-quo order the respondent No.1 herein constantly creating disturbance for the petitioner in collecting tolls as per the lease agreement. Hence the order of status<em>-quo</em> passed by this court is liable to be vacated.                      <br/>        <br/>4. Mr. Md. Nawab Ali, Advocate-on-Record appearing for the petitioner submits that after due inquiry conducted by concerned department came to a definite finding that there was no lease in favour of the writ-petitioner and there was no record in the office which shown lease in favour of the writ petitioner and as such the High Court Division should have on these admitted facts passed an order vacating the order of <em>status quo</em> and thereby depriving the writ petitioner from taking unlawful benefits.<br/><br/>5. The learned Advocate further submitted that when the very property of the lease is questionable and after due inquiry by the competent authority found to be false and on the contrary, the lease in favour of the present petitioner was found as a genuine one, the High Court Division committed error is not vacating the order of <em>status-quo</em>; that the interim order of this court is a discretionary remedy providing protec­tion to a person who has bonafide estab­lished his case but in the present case it is clearly established that the writ-petitioner for the puropse of filing a writ petition created some manufactured documents and therefore, the said petitioner cannot legally entitled to get protection of this court.<br/><br/>6. Mr. Nurul Islam Chowdhury, Advocate-on-Record, appearing for the respondent No.1 has submitted that though the order of stay was granted in 2005 while issuing the rule but the petitioner herein had no cause for concern to vacate the same and very lately an application for vacating the same was filed and moreso, when the mat­ter is ripe for hearing.<br/><br/>7.  In view of the above, we find no sub­stance in the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner.<br/>Accordingly, the leave petition is dis­missed with cost of Tk. 10,000.00.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
