Joynul Abedin J. -</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 29.5.2007passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.1262 of 2005 discharging the rule.<br/><br/>2. The respondent Nos.1-121 and some predecessors of the respondents as plaintiffs filed Other Class Suit No. 23 of 1961in the court of the learned Subordinate Judge, Rangpur for partition of the suit land. The said suit was subsequently renumbered as Other Class Suit No.105 of 1998 and there was a compromise decree passed in the suit on 14.8.2002.Some of the plaintiffs of Other Class Suit No.15 of 2004 thereafter filed Miscellaneous Case No. 61 of 2002against the aforesaid decree by filing an application under Order 9 Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure but the said Miscellaneous Case was dismissed. Thereafter Miscellaneous Appeal No. 51of 2003 was filed against the order of dismissal of the said Miscellaneous Case but this appeal was also dismissed by the judgment and order dated 14.2.2004.Thereafter Other Class Suit No. 15 of 2004 was filed before the Assistant Judge, Palashbari on 1.3.2004 praying for setting aside of the said compromise decree dated14.8.2002 in Other Class Suit No.105 of 1998. An application for staying the oper­ation of the said compromise decree was also filed under the said suit. But the learned Assistant Judge by its order dated 5.6.2004 rejected the prayer for stay.<br/><br/>3. Being aggrieved the petitioners filed Civil Revision No.12 of 2004 before the learned District Judge, Gaibandha. Subsequently the learned Additional District Judge on transfer by its judgment and order dated 23.2.2005 allowed the revision and stayed the operation of the judgment and decree passed in Other Class Suit No.   105 of 1995 as stated above.<br/><br/>4. Thereupon, the respondent Nos.1-121, who are plaintiffs in Other Class Suit No. 105 of 1998, filed Civil Revision No. 1262 of 2005 challenging the aforesaid judgment and order dated 23.2.2005. A Single Bench of the High Court Division by the impugned judgment and order dated 29.5.2007 made the rule absolute refusing to stay the operation of the said compromise decree stating that the decree obtained after a long fight of 41 years in Other Class Suit No. 105 of 1998 is not liable to be stayed when the plaintiffs of the Other Class Suit No.15 of 2004 will have the remedy under section 144 of the code of Civil Procedure for getting back their property if it is so held in their suit.<br/><br/>5. Being aggrieved the petitioner filed the present petition for leave to appeal.<br/><br/>6. Mr. Shah Mirion Alam, the learned Advocate for the petitioners submits that the High Court Division erred in failing to appreciate and consider that the plaintiffs of Other Class Suit No. 105 of 1998 admittedly claimed 8 annas shares out of 62.66 acres of land for which the plaintiffs sought for partition but the trial court illegally allowed 42.58 acres of land to the plaintiffs on account of the forged and fraudulent solenama filed before the court and in this view of the matter the operation of the aforesaid sole decree was liable to stayed till the disposal of Other Class Suit No.15 of 2004.<br/><br/>7. We have heard the learned Advocate for the petitioners and perused the connected papers including the impugned judgment. We do not find any force in the points raised. The High Court Division upon cor­rect assessment of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision. We therefore find no reason to interfere with the same.<br/>The petition is accordingly dismissed.<br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
