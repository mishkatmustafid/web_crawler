Ruhul Amin, CJ.</strong> - This petition for leave lo appeal is directed against the judgment dated June 19, 2004 of a single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No, 3395 of 2002 discharging the Rule obtained against the judgment and decree dated June 14, 2002 of the Court of District Judge, Rajshahi in Title Appeal No.219 of 2000 allowing the appeal and thereby decreeing the suit upon setting aside the judgment and decree dated May 29, 2000 of the 2nd Court of Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge) Rajshahi in Other Class Suit No.104 of 1994 dismissing the same.<br/><br/>2. The suit was filed seeking declaration of title in respect of the property mentioned in the schedule attached to the plaint.<br/><br/>3. The case of the plaintiff, in short, is that the property described in the schedule attached to the plaint was owned by Babu Kumar Ghose and another and the same was the property of Ghosh Babu Estate, that plaintiffs father took settlement of the land in suit from the said land owners by an Amalnama of the year 1349 B.S, in the name of the plaintiff who at relevant time was minor, that the land so taken settlement was 19.56 acres, that since the date of settlement plaintiff through his father owned and possessed the land so taken settlement and S.A. record was prepared in his name, that during R.S. Survey draft Khatian No.60 was prepared in his name, but the same was finally published in the name of Ex-landlords and in the remark column the property was shown as vested property, that on obtaining final R.S. khatian the plaintiff came to know on October 31, 1991 about the preparation of wrong record of right and thereupon he filed Other Class Suit No.61 of 1992 but withdrew on June 15, 1993 the same since there was formal defect and thereafter filed the instant suit.<br/><br/>4. The suit was contested by the defendant Nos.4-6, 15-17, 61-62, the defendant Nos.20, 21, 23, 52, 54 and 63-65 and also by the Government of Bangladesh by filing separate sets of written statement.<br/><br/>5. The first set of defendants filed written statement denying the material averments made in the plaint and stating, <em>inter alia</em>,that one Hanif Uddin Sarker took settlement of 14.31 acres of land in 1343 B.S. (part of 'Ka' schedule land) from Harilal  Ghosh and others, that  S.A. khatian was prepared in the name of Hanif Uddin Sarker and he paid rent upto November 9,1968, that land of Plot No.1290 measuring 0.81 decimals was sold to Samir Dewan, Nabir Dewan, Kabir Dewan and Mizan Dewan and R.S khatian was prepared in their names, that heirs of Samir Dewari and Nizan Uddin took settlement of 1.85 acres of land on 26 Poush 1343 B.S. and Nizam Uddin died leaving defendant Nos.  13-19 and S.A. Record was prepared in their names and R.S. record was prepared in the name of heirs of Nizam Uddin who were minors but at the final  stage  the  land was recorded in the name of the Jaminder, that heirs of Nizam Uddin has filed the suit against the wrong record and the same is pending, that one Edul Uddin took settlement of 1.36 acres  of land from Hiralal on 13 Magh, 1343 B.S. and S.A. record was prepared in his name and the heirs of Edul Uddin   are possessing the said land, that the S.A. record prepared in the name of the plaintiff was not genuine.<br/><br/>6. The case of the second set of the defendants, in short, is that 14.31 acres of land of 2nd lot i.e. land of "Ka" schedule was taken settlement on  1st Baishakh, 1343 B.S. by Hanif Uddin Sarker from Hiralal and R.S. khatian was prepared in his name, that Hanif Sarker sold 1.53 acres of land to the defendant No.20, the  predecessor of the defendant Nos.21,22-23 and Abdul All and the purchasers are in possession of the land in suit, that the a aforesaid purchasers mutated their names i and the R.S. record was prepared in their names showing quantity of land as 1.47 acres, that one Moslema Khatun sold 1.65 acres of land from "Kha" schedule to  Hanif Uddin and that later on one Mazeda Khatun purchased 1.65 acres of land from Hanif Uddin, that Hanif Uddin sold 1.65 acres of land on August 24,1963 i.e. land of "Uma" schedule to Mazeda Khatun and Moslema Khatun and others and record of right was prepared in their names, that Hanif Uddin sold 4.00 acres of land to Abdus Sobhan and also 3 acres of land to one Namazi who died leaving the defendant Nos.57-60, that Shimul Mondal took settlement of 1.06 acres of land from Hiralal and others on 16th Falgun, 1343 B.S. and the said land has been recorded in the name of the defendant No.20, that the defendants claimed right, title and possession in the land in suit and denied the possession of the plaintiff.<br/><br/>7. The suit was also contested by the defendant Nos.63-65 by filing written statement and the defendant Nos. 66-67 claimed the land of Plot No.2 on the basis of settlement.<br/><br/>8. The suit was also contested by the defendant No.1, Government of Bangladesh, primarily claiming the land as vested property upon contending  that owners of the land left erstwhile East Pakistan and settled in India, accordingly the land became vested property and R.S. khatian was prepared accordingly and the vested property authority is enjoying the property and the plaintiff has no right, title and interest in the land in suit, that the plaintiff has created forged and fabricated papers to grab the land of the Government.<br/><br/>9. The trial Court dismissed the suit on the findings that in R.S. Khatian 5.35 acres of land has been recorded in the name of the Government and the rest of the land has been recorded in the name of other defendants and the defendants have paid rent to the government on the basis of the R.S. Khatian, that although plaintiff filed certain rent receipts but it is difficult to ascertain that the said rent receipts are as regard  the land in suit, that although record of right is not document of title but the R.S. record has some presumptive value and one who challenges  the correctness of the R.S. record one is to establish the incorrectness of the said R.S. record, that although plaintiff is claiming that the R.S. record prepared in the name of the defendants was wrong but he failed to establish  the  said  contention, that plaintiff although claimed possession in the land in suit but he failed to prove the same, rather it appears the defendants are in possession in the land in suit, that the plaintiff failed to establish his case beyond doubt and as such he is not entitled to the relief sought.<br/><br/>10. The plaintiff as against the judgment and decree of the trial Court went an appeal. The appellate Court on detail discussion of the evidence, both oral and documentary, of the parties arrived at the finding that the suit is not barred by limitation, that the plaintiff has proved, his claim by competent witnesses and thereupon held that the record in respect of the land in suit ought to have been prepared in the name of the plaintiff, that plaintiff's father took settlement of the land in suit in the name of the plaintiff in 1349 B.S. when he was minor and that Ex-landlords executed an Amalnama and rent was realized by the Ex landlords upon granting rent receipts, that plaintiff's father took settlement of the land in the name of the plaintiff.<br/><br/>11. The appellate Court on the aforesaid findings allowed the appeal upon setting aside the judgment and decree of the trail Court and thereupon decreed the suit.<br/><br/>12. As against the judgment and decree of the appellate Court 12 defendants moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained Rule.<br/><br/>13. The High Court Division noticed the finding of the appellate Court that the Amalnama of Hanif Sarker is of recent origin since the ink therein appeared to the appellate Court fresh and that scribe of the Amalnama was not examined and also the finding of the appellate Court that the witnesses of the defendants were highly interested. The High Court Division also noticed the finding of the appellate Court that Hanif Sarker was not real settlement holder and that defendants did not take any step to prove the tenants' ledger to establish that the Amalnama in the name of Hanif Sarker is genuine, that evidence of D.W.2 as noticed by the appellate Court was also considered by the High Court Division and D.W.2 stated that in the Government record Hanif Barker's name is absent.<br/><br/>14. It may be mentioned that the High Court Division found that S.A. record was prepared in the name of the plaintiff and the plaintiff paid rent on the basis of the S.A. record upto 1381 B.S. and in the background of the said fact the finding of the appellate Court was that R.S. record was wrongly prepared in the name of the defendants. The High Court Division on consideration of the evidence on record found that the appellate Court was quite correct in holding that the plaintiff has right, title and interest and possession in the land in suit on the basis of settlement taken in 1349 B.S.<br/><br/>15. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners has submitted that the pattan of the year of 1349 B.S. being in favour of a minor was void and as such on the basis of the said void pattan plaintiff as did not acquire any right, title and interest in the land in suit the lower appellate Court was wrong in holding that the plaintiff on the basis of pattan of 1349 B.S. acquired title in the land in suit.<br/><br/>16. It is seen from the judgment of the appellate Court that the said Court on detail discussion of the evidence, both oral and documentary, of the parties arrived at the finding that pattan of the year 1349 B.S. in respect of the land in suit is genuine and the pattan in respect of the land in suit said to have been taken by Hanif Sarker was not a genuine one. The lower appellate Court also on consideration of the evidence on record found possession of the plaintiff and held that R.S. record prepared in the name of the Government and other defendants in respect of the land in suit was wrong. It is seen from the judgment of the lower appellate Court that S.A. record was prepared in the name of the plaintiff and he paid rent upto 1381 B.S. and this fact sufficiently demonstrates that the plaintiff is in possession of the land in suit. The last court of fact on detail discussion of evidence on record found settlement said to have been taken by Hanif Barker is not genuine and consequent thereupon the defendants' claim of interest in the land in suit through Hanif Barker is not legally sustainable.<br/><br/>17. The contention of the learned counsel that the land in suit as was taken settlement in the name of the minor boy same was void and consequently no title was acquired on the basis of the said settlement of 1349 B.S., even for argument's sake is accepted then too the plaintiff's title by laps of time has ripen as seen from the materials on record that he is in possession of the land in suit since the date of settlement and record of right i.e. S.A. Khatian at one stage was prepared in his name and he was recognised as tenant in respect of land since he paid rent upto 1381 B.S.<br/><br/>18. In that view of the   matter, particularly the final Court of fact having had found possession of the plaintiff on elaborate discussion of the evidence, we are of the opinion that the High Court Division has not committed any error in affirming the judgment of the Court of appeal below. It has been submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the appellate Court only narrated the evidence of the witnesses of the parties and that upon assessing the said evidence did not arrive at the conclusive finding as to the case of the respective parties, particularly when the trial Court on consideration of the evidence held that the plaintiff has no right, title and interest and also possession in the land in suit. The submission so made in its entirety is not correct since from the judgment of the lower appellate Court it is seen that the said Court on consideration of the materials on record arrived at the finding that the plaintiff has acquired right, title and interest in the land in suit on the basis of pattan in the year 1349 B.S. and that he has possession in the land in suit and that S.A. record was prepared in respect of the land in suit in his name and R.S. record was wrongly prepared in the name of the defendants and that the document on the basis of which defendants claimed title in the land in suit is not genuine. The finding of possession in respect of the land in suit in favour of the plaintiff by the appellate Court is quite sustainable in the eye of law since from the reading of the evidence, as reflected in the judgment of the appellate. Court it is seen that the conclusion so arrived at is quite correct.<br/><br/>19. In the background of the discussion made hereinabove we find no merit in the petition.<br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
