The facts involved in the case, in short, are that the land recorded in C.S. <em>Khatian</em> No.2 originally belonged to Penendu Narayan Roy Dev Barmon and his name has been recorded in C.S. <em>Khatian</em> No.2 of the suit mouza; that the ex-landlord has given settlement of the suit land in favour of one Darkanath Dev and others but for arrears of rents ex-landlord has taken back the land in his <em>khas</em> possession from the aforesaid tenants. On 27.11.1951 B.S. the predecessor of the plaintiff namely Kalimuddin Mondal took<em> pattan</em> of the suit land as described in schedule 'Ka' of the plaint from the aforesaid ex-landlord; that since the date of <em>pattan </em>the predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiffs has been possessing the suit land measuring .24 acres of land with another .04 acres of land from another non suited plot but adjoining to the-suit plot; that after the abolishment of zamindary system the predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiffs became direct tenant of the Government and the Government recognized him as tenant of the suit land by realizing rents from him; that during the period of M.R.R. operation the suit land recorded in the name of predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiffs in M.R.R. <em>Khatian</em> No. 14; that thereafter, Kalimuddin died leaving behind the plaintiffs as his legal heirs and since then the plaintiffs have been possessing the suit land for more than 12(twelve) years; that in the recent revislonal record of right, the suit land has been recorded in R.S. <em>Khatian</em> No. 1327; that the plaintiffs went to local Tahsil office for paying rents of the suit plot No.698 but the Tahsil office refused to take rents from them because plot No.698 was not recorded in M.R.R. <em>Khatian</em> 14; that thereafter, the plaintiffs went to defendant No.2, for correction of the record of right but he advised them to take shelter in the Civil Court; that on refusal to accept rents from the plaintiffs by the office of the defendant No.2 the right, title of the plaintiffs over the suit land has been clouded, hence the suit.<br/><br/>3. The defendant No.1 contested the suit by filing written statement stating, <em>inter-alia</em>, that the suit is not maintainable; that the suit is barred by limitation; that the suit is hit by Section 42 S.R. Act and it suffers from nonjoinder of parties. The case of the defendant is that the suit land measuring .28 decimals of land was recorded in the name of the Government is S.A. <em>Khatian</em> No.1 and an area of .37 acres of land has been recorded in plot No.698 under <em>Khatian</em> No.267 in the name of Braza Madhab Dev and others; that the recorded tenants left the country and consequently, the land was enlisted as vested property; that the plaintiffs have brought the suit on the basis of false allegations with a view to grab the suit land. So, the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>4. Mr. Md. Mozammel Haque, learned Advocate, appearing for the petitioners submitted that the certified copies of the registered <em>pattan </em>dated 23.04.1945 which is the basic document of title of the plaintiff for the suit land was filed in the Court of Appeal below by which the disputed land was given<em> pattan</em> to the predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiff by the original owner nor the supplementary affidavit filed at the time of hearing of the aforesaid civil revision, containing the certified copy of the aforesaid registered deed dated 23.04.1945 being the title deed of the plaintiff was considered by the High Covirt Division; that after execution of the registered <em>patta</em> on 23.04.1945 by the original owner, whose title in the suit land became extinguished since the date of execution on 23.04.1945, title of the plaintiff on the suit land had accrued on the aforesaid date; that even if the original owner subsequently after 23.04.1945 had migrated to India which the defendant Government totally failed to prove and the evidence on record does not support the contention by the defendant that the suit land had vested in the Government so no question of passing of title to the Government does arise at all, as title of the original owner had been extinguished long ago on 23.04.1945 and passed to the plaintiff in the aforesaid registered <em>pattan</em>, executed and registered on 23.04.1945 by the original owner; that non-consideration of the aforesaid fact more particularly when oral evidence of a competent persons serves as secondary evidence under Section 63(4) of the Evidence Act the certified copy of the aforesaid registered<em> patta </em>dated 23.04.1945 as well as of the supplementary affidavit filed in the Civil Revision. The learned Advocate further submitted that the Court of Appeal below most illegally and whimsically did not take into consideration the certified copy of the registered <em>patta </em>dated 23.04.1945 nor take those into evidence in exercise of power under Section 107 of the Code of Civil Procedure and thus, by an erroneous view agreeing with the finding of the Court of Appeal below committed an error of law in holding that the plaintiff had miserably failed to establish its right and title in the suit land which is contrary to the evidence.<br/><br/>5. It appears that the trial Court as well as the Court of Appeal below on consideration of the evidence, both oral and documentary found that the plaintiffs could not prove their right and title in the suit land. It appears that in the instant case, the plaintiffs claimed their predecessor-in-interest became tenant of the suit land by way of <em>pattan </em>as well as oral gift but at the trial the plaintiff could not prove neither the story of <em>pattan</em> nor the oral gift by adducing any reliable or documentary evidence. It also appears that the plaintiffs had no title to the suit land and the story of <em>pattan</em> as well as oral gift is false. Accordingly, both the Courts below rightly and correctly arrived at a finding that the plaintiffs failed to establish their right and title in the suit land.<br/>In view of the above, we find no substance in the submissions of the learned Counsel for the petitioners.<br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.</div></div></div>
