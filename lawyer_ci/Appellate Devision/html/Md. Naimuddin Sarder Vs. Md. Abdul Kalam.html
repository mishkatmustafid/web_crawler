Afzal J. —</strong> This is a defendant's appeal following leave and arising out of Judgment dated 2nd August 1983 passed by a Single Judge of the High Court Division (Jessore Bench) in Second Appeal setting aside the judgment and decree of the court of appeal below and restoring those of the trial court.<br/><br/>2. Respondent No.1 as plaintiff filed Title Suit No. 208 of 1974 in the Second Court of Munsif, Kushtia on the averments, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit land measuring .33 decimals recorded in Plot No. 1177 under C.S. Khatian No. 755 originally be longed to Radha Prasanna Biswas and others who took settlement of the land from the C.S. recorded tenant Nabin Chandra Mondal at a jama of Tk. 3/12/- anna in 1329 B.S. Radha Prasanna Biswas and others, possessed the same after settlement and thereafter ex­changed the property with the plaintiff in 1356 B.S. and executed a general power of attorney in favour of plaintiffs brother Amjad Hossain. Thereafter, Amjad Hossain executed a kabala in respect of the suit land and other lands in favour of the plaintiff on 11-12-56. Since exchange and execution of kabala deed in “his favour the plaintiff has been possessing the suit land through different borgaders. Defendant No. 1 ap­pellant took borga settlement from the plaintiff and possessed the same on delivering plaintiffs share of the produce. The plaintiff being an employee of the Steamer Company very often remained away from his residence. Defendant No.1 refused to deliver plaintiffs share of the borga crop is 1376 B.S. and also refused to vacate the land on demand and thereby dispossessed the plaintiff from the suit land. Defen­dant No.1 has no right, title and interest in the suit land. Having failed to obtain the land amicably on demand the plaintiff was constrained to file this suit for declaration of title and khas possession.<br/><br/>3. Defendant—1 Appellant contested the suit by filing a written statement denying all the material al­legations made in the plaint. His case, in short, is that the suit property originally belonged to Nabin Chandra Mondal and that he took settlement of .69 decimals of land at a jama of Tk. 2/1/6 pies in 1334 B.S. and thereafter took settlement of 1.00 acre at a jama of Tk. 3/- in 1336 B.S. and that he has since been possessing the land. The rent receiving interest of the Touji was subsequently auction purchased by Jarafat Munshi and Sara Begum and thereafter he paid rent to the new landlords at an amalgamated jama of Tk. 5/1/6 pies. The plaintiff has no title and posses­sion in the suit land who taking advantage of the wrong record during S. A. operation filed this suit with a view to grab the suit property.<br/><br/>4. The learned Munsif upon a consideration of the evidence found that Radha Prasanna Biswas got the suit land by settlement from Nabin Chandra Mon­dal and the plaintiff got it from Radha Prasanna by ex­change, that he got possession of the suit land after exchange with Radha Prasanna and that defendant No. 1 dispossessed the plaintiff from the suit land in 1376 B. S. by refusing to pay adhai share of the land and further that the suit was not barred by limitation. Ac­cordingly he decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiff. On appeal by the defendant-appellant, however, the learned subordinate Judge reversed the aforesaid find­ings of the learned Munsif and dismissed the suit. Plaintiff being aggrieved by the appellate decree pre­ferred second appeal No. 280 of 1978 before the High Court Division. As already noticed the learned Judge of the High Court Division by the impugned Judg­ment set aside the judgment and decree of the Lower Appellate Court and restored those of the Trial Court.<br/><br/>5. Leave was granted to consider the submission that the findings of fact arrived at by the lower appel­late court on consideration of evidence have been ille­gally disturbed by the learned Judge of the High Court Division on misconstruction of documentary evi­dence, particularly the rent-receipts produced by the parties and also on wrong view of law taken by the learned Single Judge, in respect of the proceeding un­der section 19(1) of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act.<br/><br/>6. As to jurisdiction of the High Court Division under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure to interfere with the finding of fact of the court of appeal below, it is now well-established that the High Court Division can only invoke its jurisdiction under the said Section if there is any error of law or procedure committed by the first appellate court and such error has affected the merit of the decision, otherwise a finding of fact, however wrong it might appear, can­not be interfered with in second appeal. In explaining the scope of section 100 C.P.C this court in the case of <em><strong>Erfan Ali V. Joynal Abdein Mia, 1983 BLD (AD) 342</strong></em> observed that in every case the general principle to be followed is that a finding of fact arrived at by the court of first appeal shall not be disturbed by the High Court, but a finding of fact to attain immunity from attack in second appeal must be based on evidence. If a finding is not based on evidence or if it is based on utter inadequacy of evidence on which no reasonable conclusion can be reached then interference therewith in second appeal is certainly justified. Misreading of evidence is a ground for interference, but misappreciation of evi­dence is not. A finding which is inconsistent with the evidence on record must call for interference is second appeal. Again if a decision of the lower ap­pellate court consists of both oral and documentary evidence but a part of the documentary evidence is misunderstood, it will not provide a ground for inter­ference when the document docs not form the pre­ponderance of the evidence. High Court's power in second appeal docs not include power to review the evidence to come to a finding of its own on a ques­tion of fact, but the High Court can give a finding which has not been given by the lower appellate court on the evidence on record. After all, every case must be decided on the facts and circumstances of that case keeping in view these broad principles.<br/><br/>7. In the instant case the learned Subordinate Judge proceeded to consider the respective cases of the plaintiff and defendant upon reiterating the age-old axiom that the plaintiff must succeed on his own case and weakness of defendant's case is no ground for passing a decree in favour of the plaintiff. The Subordinate Judge after finding that the plaintiffs case has not been proved went on to hold further that he agreed with the trial court that the story of lease set up by the defendant was un-acceptable and that the defendant's title also was not proved. It seems that the learned Judge of the High Court Division failed to appreciate the approach and findings made by the Subordinate Judge, for, it will be seen that quite a large part of the impugned judgment is devoted to the consideration of the defendant's weakness (as to his dakhilas, rejection of objection under section 19 (1) of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act) which was wholly unnecessary as the same did not prove or strengthen the plaintiff case. The learned judge found fault with the subordinate judge for not considering the weakness of the defendant's case and particularly the rent-receipts produced by him and thus considered himself justified to interfere in second appeal. It must be said that the learned Judge made a fundamental mis­take in ignoring altogether that the defendant's case was disbelieved by the lower appellate court but even then the plaintiff was held not to be entitled to a de­cree as he could not establish his own case.<br/><br/>8. As regards plaintiffs case of title to the suit land it is based on the kabala (Ext. 2) dated 11-12-56 executed on behalf of Radha Prasanna and others. In the original plaint nothing was said as to how Radha Prasanna and others acquired title to the Suitland. Defendant-appellant in his written statement filed more than a year after the institution of the suit on 31-5-74 stated that he took settlement of the suitland in 1334 and 1336 B.S. from the C.S. recorded tenant Nabin Chandra Mondal. Plaintiff then, it seems, became wiser and amended his plaint about one year after the filing of the written statement introducing a case for the first time that his vendors also took settlement of the Suitland from Nabin Chandra in 1329 B. S. He filed the alleged Pattani dakhilas on 19-9-76 long after filing of the written statement by the defendant. This aspect of the case whether Radha Prasanna took settle­ment from Nabin Chandra became of crucial impor­tance in view of the plaintiffs omission to mention about the said fact in the original plaint and failure to file the Pattani dakhilas at the time of the institution of the suit although the plaintiff admitted in his evi­dence that they knew about Radha Parasanna's settle­ment from Nabin Chandra at the time of exchange and they had obtained the Pattani dakhilas at that time. The learned Subordinate Judge viewed the belated amendment of the plaint with shrewd suspicion and upon an intelligent analysis of the evidence and cir­cumstances came to the conclusion that the plaintiffs case as to settlement by Nabin Chandra with Radha Prasanna had not been proved. It is unfortunate that the learned Judge of the High Court Division failed to notice the import of the Subordinate Judge's appreciation of the circumstances of the case relating to be­lated amendment of the plaint which cast a doubt on the plaintiff’s case. The learned Judge, it appears, quite unnecessarily took upon himself the task of explaining the law at length as to amendment of plaint which was never in doubt. It is, however, strange that it did not occur to him that the subse­quent amendment of the plaint seeking to clothe Radha Prasanna with a title in the circumstances of the ease raised genuine doubt as to plaintiffs case. Not only the amendment was belated but the alleged Pattani Dakhilas which were the only proof of Radha Prasanna's alleged settlement and were allegedly with the plaintiff from the time of exchange were produced long after the institution of the suit. There was no other evidence to prove alleged settlement with Radha Prasanna except the two doubtful Dakhilas Ext. 1 (kha) and 1 (ga). The Subordinate Judge noticed that the plaintiff did not even examine Jarafat Munshi who was alive and to whom rent was al­legedly paid and Dakhilas Ext. 1 and 1(ka) were ob­tained. The learned Judge of the High Court Division ignoring the consideration which weighed with the Subordinate Judge to discard the plaintiff’s dakhilas proceeded to consider the defendant's dakhilas unnecessarily forgetting that both the courts be­low disbelieved the defendant's case. How misdirect­ed was, the learned Judge will be seen from the Judgment, to quote his own words, "this (defendant’s dakhila) had not been considered by the court of ap­peal below and this being a basic document of title sought to be used by the defendant a finding arrived at by a non-consideration and misconstruction or misreading of the said document would amount to a question of law which need to be interfered with by this court in its appellate jurisdiction". It must be said that the learned Judge made an entirely wrong approach to the case and the impugned judgment be­fore him and failed to notice that there was neither any error of law or procedure in the judgment of the Subordinate Judge calling for interference with the finding of fact arrived at by him. If Radha Prasanna’s settlement was not proved as found by the Sub­ordinate Judge, the plaintiff could not derive any title from kabala Ext. 2, no matter whether the Power of Attorney was genuine or not.<br/><br/>9. Then again it will be seen that the learned Subordinate Judge upon a consideration of the evi­dence on record clearly found as a fact that the plain­tiff was not in possession of the land after his alleged kabala in 1956. He further found that the defendant (admittedly in possession) was not in possession of the land under alleged borga settlement by the plain­tiff. The suit was instituted in 1974 on the allegation that the plaintiff was in possession and then dispos­sessed by the defendant in 1376 B.S. The finding of the lower appellate court being that the plaintiff was not in possession since his alleged kabala in 1956; the clear legal inference is that the suit was barred by limitation. We find it a matter of great regret that the learned Judge of the High Court Division gave no consideration to the question of limitation and the aforesaid finding of fact as to possession and the legal consequence of the said finding. It was merely ob­served in the penultimate paragraph that it is admitted in the plaint that the plaintiff has been dispossessed and that the defendant is in possession of the property and this is the admitted position as to possession which prompted the court of first instance after hav­ing found title of the plaintiff to pass a decree for re­covery of possession. Nobody admitted that defendant dispossessed the plaintiff. Further the lower appellate court made a finding that the plaintiff was out of pos­session for more than 12 years and consequently the suit is time-barred. The trial court's finding as to limitation thus stands reversed. We regret to notice that in spite of the finding as to limitation by the subordi­nate judge having been allowed to remain, the learned Judge of the High Court Division has found it possi­ble and proper to restore the decree in favour of the plaintiff. We are thus of the view that the learned Judge plainly exceeded his jurisdiction under Section 100 C.P.C. and unnecessarily interfered with the deci­sion of the lower appellate court. The impugned Judg­ment is thus not sustainable in law.<br/>In the result, therefore, the appeal is allowed with cost. The impugned judgment and decree of the High Court Division are set aside and those of the first ap­pellate court restored.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
