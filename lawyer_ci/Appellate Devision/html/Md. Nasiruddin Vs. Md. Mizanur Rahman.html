Nasiruddin, seeks leave to appeal against the judgment and order dated 26.02.2006 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 1238 of 2004 making the Rule absolute setting aside the judgment and decree dated 07.03.1998 passed by Senior Assistant Judge and S.C.C. Judge, Sadar, Joypurhat in S.C.C. Suit No.3 of 1998 dismissing the same.<br/><br/>2. The respondent as plaintiff instituted the aforesaid S.C.C. Suit No. 3 of 1998 in the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, exercising Small Cause Courts Jurisdiction, Sadar, Joypurhat, impleading the petitioner praying for ejectment of the defendant from the suit premises alleging, <em>inter alia</em>, that the Plaintiffs father, Md. Yakub Ali Sarder, was the owner of the suit premises and the defendant was  inducted as a monthly tenant therein and the said Md. Yakub Ali Sarder transferred the suit land  by a registered deed of <em>heba-bil-ewaj </em>dated 06.09.1988 in favour of the plaintiff and his brothers namely, Mamunur Rashid, Mahbubur Rashid and Mahfuzur Rahman. Subsequently by a deed of partition the said four brothers made partition of the entire property received by them from their father and the suit premises along with other properties fell in the saham of the plaintiff and the defendant ultimately attorned the plaintiff as his landlord in respect of the shop premises being shop Nos.3 and 4 at monthly rental of 300+300=600.00 in total and paid monthly rents to the plaintiff for the month of January and February, 1998 but stopped payment of monthly rents from the month of March, 1998 and thereby became a defaulter. The plaintiff also claimed that he had bonafide requirement of the suit premises for starting business therein and accordingly served a notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act to the defendant terminating the tenancy and asking him to vacate the suit premises but the defendant did not hand over the pos­session of the suit premises in favour of the plaintiff, on the contrary informed the plaintiff through his learned Advocate that he paid rent in Court in House Rent Case No. 7 of 1994. The plaintiff alleged that he was not made a party in the said House Rent Case No. 7 of 1994 and was not aware about the house rent case. The plaintiff, therefore, claimed that the defen­dant was a habitual defaulter in payment of monthly rents and the plaintiff bonafide required the suit premises and accordingly instituted the suit.<br/><br/>3. The defendant contested the suit by fil­ing a written statement contending that he was tenant under late Md. Yakub Ali Sarder who became sick and his son Mahbubur Rashid used to collect rent and during the said period landlord Md. Yakub Ali took TK. 8,000.00 from the defendant for repairing shop No.13 and after neces­sary repair shop No. 13 was renumbered as shop No.4. The defendant further alleged that the landlord Md. Yakub Ali took TK. 60,000.00 from the defendant by sell­ing possession of suit premises No. 9 on 25.06.1987 on the basis of an agreement and that after the death of Md. Yakub Ali, his son Mahbubur Rashid refused to received rent of the suit shop No. 3 and 4 and at the request of the said Mahbubur Rashid rent from the period from 1993 and 1994 was sent by money order and the said Mahbubur Rashid received the said money order and that rent for the month of February, 1994 in respect of the shop Nos. 3 and 4 was sent by money order but was refused to receive by the said Mahbubur Rashid and when this was com­municated to the said Mahbubur Rashid he advised the defendant to sent the rent in favour of Mizanur Rahman and accord­ingly, the defendant sent the rent for the month of February and March, 1994 to Mizanur Rahman which came back and ultimately the defendant deposited the rent for the month of February, 1994 in House Rent Case No. 7 of 1994 and he has deposited all the rents upto date in the said House Rent Case No. 7 of 1994 and there was a solenama filed on 21.01.1998 in House Rent Case No. 7 of 1994 in which it was decided that the plaintiff shall receive rent at the rate of TK. 300.00+300.00 as landlord in respect of suit shop Nos. 3 and 4 within the 1st week of the month and if he neglects to receive rent same shall be deposited in the aforesaid House Rent Case No. 7 of 1994. The defendant alleged that he is neither a habitual defaulter nor a defaulter in the suit premises and that the plaintiff does not bonafide require the suit premises as alleged by him. The plaintiff is an agriculturist and he is in no way con­nected with any business and that the plaintiff and his brothers have got other shop premises and instituted the present suit to make unlawful gain and prayed for dismissal of the suit.<br/><br/>4. Mr. A. J. Mohammad Ali, learned Counsel, appearing for the petitioner sub­mitted that the trial Court recorded a clear finding that the defendant was not a defaulter in respect of payment of month­ly rents and this being a finding of fact should not be disturbed by the revisional Court and as such, the same has caused miscarriage of justice; that under Section 18 of the Premises of Rent Control Act no decree for recovery of possession of any premises shall be passed as long as the tenant paid rent to the full allowable by the Ordinance and admittedly rent for the month of January and February, 1998 was accepted by the landlord but the rent for the month of March was not accepted and then the defendant sent the rent by money order which was not received by the land­lord and the money order was returned back to the tenant and the tenant rushed to the House Rent Controller and made the deposit in House Rent Case No. 7 of 1994 and so it cannot be held that the tenant was not willing to pay the monthly rent and in the absence of any evidence that the tenant was not willing to pay the rent to the full extent allowable by the Ordinance, the tenant cannot be evicted from the suit premises which shall be contrary to the provision of Section 18 of the Premises of Rent Control Act and in that view of the matter the impugned judgment and order is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>5. It appears from the record that its is not disputed that Md. Yakub Ali was the orig­inal owner of the suit premises and during his life time he transferred the suit premis­es to his sons including the present plain­tiff, Md. Mizanur Rahman. There is also no dispute that there was amicable parti­tion between the four brothers in respect of their properties received from their father, Md. Yakub Ali and the suit premis­es fell in the saham of the plaintiff-respondent. It is further admitted that the defendant being a tenant attorned the plaintiff as his landlord by paying month­ly rents for the months of January and February, 1998 vide Ext.4 and 10. The dis­pute started with regard to payment of rent for the month of March, 1998. According to the plaintiff, the defendant stopped pay­ment of monthly rent from the month of March, 1998. According to the contesting defendant, he offered the rent for the month of March, 1998 to the plaintiff who refused to receive the same and the defen­dant then sent the rent for the month of March, 1998 by post to the plaintiff who refused to receive the rent and the money order was returned by the postal authori­ties to the defendant and the defendant then rushed to the house rent controller and started depositing the monthly rent in H.R.C. Case No.7 of 1994. It appears that the said case was filed by the present tenant-petitioner against Md. Mahbubur Rashid who was not the present landlord of the defendant. The order dated 7 21.01.1998 shows that the present tenant-petitioner and the said Md. Mahbubur Rashid filed a petition of compromise Ext. S (ka). It appears that H.R.C Case No.78 of 1994 was disposed of in terms of solenama and it was not alive at the relevant time and further this was not a case filed against the plaintiff-respondent landlord. It also appears that the tenant failed to deposit the rent for the month of March and afterwards in terms of Section 19 of the Premises Control Act and cannot avoid his eviction from' the suit premises. Even the tenant cannot resist his eviction if he is found defaulter for one month only and the Premises Rent Control Act requires that the tenant must pay the monthly rent in terms of Section 18 within the pre-scribed period to get protection from eviction and not otherwise. In any view, the scope of the scrutiny under Section 25 of the Small Causes Courts Act is much wider and the revisional Court is permit-ted to reassess the evidence in the light of the pleadings of the parties and also may consider all other evidence on record and is not restricted in exercise of its revision-al power as is limited under Section115 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure.     <br/><br/>6. The High Court Division held in the light of the above fact that "the trial Court erred in law and facts in dismissing the suit on holding that the defendant is not a defaulter on misconception of documentary evidence and also misconstrued H.R.C Case No. 7 of 1994 overlooking that in the said case the present plaintiff was not a party and the deposit made in the said case could not be legal and valid as against the plaintiff and further the said case was not alive on the relevant date."<br/>In view of the above, we find no sub­stance in the submissions of the learned Counsel for the petitioner.<br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
