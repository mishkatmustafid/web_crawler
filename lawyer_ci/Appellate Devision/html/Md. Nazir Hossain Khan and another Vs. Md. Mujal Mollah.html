The plaintiff-respondent Md. Mujal Mollah (substituted by his heirs and succes­sors since his death) instituted the suit for a declaration that four kabalas are null and void and not binding upon him. He averred that the suit land originally belonged to him. Defendant No. 1 had been residing in his house as a Jaygir since long. The plain­tiff trusted defendant No. 1 in managing his affairs. Defendant No. 1 obtained an employment at Dhaka and attained solven­cy. In such a climate of mutual trust the plaintiff mortgaged one bigha of land to defendant No. 1 and got a sum of Tk. 1,000/-. The mortgage was for 6 years and the registered deed of mortgage is dated 1-3-79. On 15-6-83 defendant No. 1 began to excavate a pond in the suit land comprising a total area of 1.41 acres. The plaintiff resis­ted when defendant No. 1 disclosed that he had purchased the suit land from the plain­tiff. The plaintiff came to know for the first time that on 1-3-79 defendant No. 1 collusively manufactured two deeds in his own name and another two deeds in the name of his wife, defendant No. 2, showing pur­chase of the entire 1.41 acres of land from him. The plaintiff never executed and regis­tered those four deeds. He did not receive any consideration money for those deeds. Defendant No. 1 collusively created those four deeds for wrongful gain and hence the suit with the prayer for a declaration that registered deed Nos. 2405, 2407, 2412 and 2419 dated 1-3-79 executed by the plaintiff in favour of the defendants are null and void and are not binding on him.<br/><br/>3. Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 contended in their written statement that the suit is not maintainable in law and that the suit was false and concocted. Defendant No. 1 resided in the house of the plaintiff's father as Jaygir only for one year in 1948 when he was a student of Madrasha. At that time the plaintiff was only 8/9 years old. In 1978 the plaintiff expressed his desire to sell some property and entered into a contract with him for sale of .82 acres of land for a con­sideration of Tk. 20,000/- and this contract of sale was executed and registered on 17-7-78. The plaintiff took advance considera­tion money of Tk. 8,000/- at the time of the contract. Subsequently the plaintiff needed more money and wanted to sell his entire 1.41 acres of land to defendant No. 1 at a total consideration of Tk. 34,000/-. Defendant No. 1 agreed and as per the new agreement the plaintiff executed a deed of sale on 27-2-79 in favour of defendant No. 2 in respect of. 33 acres of land and in favour of defendant No. 1 on 28-2-79 in respect of .42 acres of land. The plaintiff agreed to execute two other documents on 1-3-79 and register all the four deeds on the same date. The plaintiff kept the two kabala deeds dated 27-2-79 and 28-2-79 in the custody of defendant No.1 and executed two other deeds of sale on 1-3-79, one in favour of defendant No.2 in respect of .33 acres and another in the name of defendant No. 1 in respect of .33 acres. The plaintiff regis­tered all the four deeds of sale on the same day on 1-3-79. The plaintiff is a literate per­son. He purchased the stamps etc. through his scribe Madhuri and had the deeds writ­ten by Madhuri after receiving the entire consideration money of Tk. 34,000/-. After purchase defendant Nos. 1 and 2 have mutated their names in respect of 1.41 acres of land as well as some other lands which defendant No. 1 purchased from the plain­tiff's mother and sister. The khatian num­bers are 226 and 227.Defendant No. 1 has installed tube-well, constructed toilet and homestead and is living in the suit land with his family members.<br/><br/>4. The trial Court noticed the cross-examination of the plaintiff as P.W. 1 that at the time of deposition he was landless though he had many land earlier and that he had sold out those lands for money. The plaintiff is also well aware of the process as to how land is sold and purchased. P.W. 1 admitted in cross-examination that defendant No.1 excavated a pond in the suit land covering an area of 5/6 kathas and also has a dwelling house, tube-well etc. upon the suit land. The finding of the trial Court is that the defendants have been possessing the suit land. The trial Court found the plaintiff to be a person unworthy of credit. He admitted in cross-examination that he filed a criminal case against defendant No. 1, which was dismissed for default, as he could not appear with his witnesses. It is the defendant's case that he also purchased some other lands from the mother and sister of the plaintiff, but P.W.1 was evasive as to whether he knew about it or not. The trial Court drew adverse presumption against this conduct of the plaintiff. The trial Court found that the plaintiff has not given any clear version in the plaint as to whether the four deeds were forged or obtained by inter­polation. The alleged deed of mortgage is not forthcoming. The trial Court disbe­lieved the other three witnesses for the plaintiff for making contradictory state­ments. The trial Court held that the plaintiff did not discharge the primary onus to prove that the impugned deeds were not executed by him. The suit was not maintainable with­out a prayer for cancellation of the four deeds on payment of <em><img src="file:///C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image002.gif" style="height:16px; width:16px"/>ad valorem </em>Court fees.<br/><br/>5. In the appeal that was tiled by the plaintiff the appellate Court found that the signatures of the plaintiff in the disputed kabalas are not in question. It was rather admitted that he signed the deeds but did not know that those were sale deeds. The defendants filed the original sale deeds from where it appeared to the lower appellate Court that the plaintiff's signatures as transpired from the plaint and deposition are same and similar to those of the kabalas. Ext. A is the registered contract of sale which was executed by the plaintiff in favour of defendant No. 2 on 17-7-78. The appellate Court below found that the signa­tures of the plaintiff are also available from Ext. A. Therefore there cannot be any doubt as to the genuineness of the execution of the document by the plaintiff. The appellate Court below also affirmed the findings of the trial Court that the defendants are in possession of the suit land. The appellate Court below also found that the suit was not maintainable in the absence of a prayer for consequential relief of cancellation of the deeds on payment of <em>ad valorem</em> Court fees.<br/><br/>6. In revision, Civil Revision No. 459 of 1992, preferred by the plaintiff, the Rule was absolute on two grounds, first, the non-maintainability of the suit on the ground of not praying for cancellation of the deeds on payment of <em>ad valorem </em>Court fees "does not inspire any confidence in me. The suit is maintainable as it was a suit for simple dec­laration". Secondly, the four impugned deeds were not put into evidence. It was not understandable to the High Court Division how the lower appellate Court took into consideration those documents "to come to such finding on fraud". The appellate Court's conclusion, it held, was based on no evidence.<br/><br/>7. Thereafter the High Court Division found that the plaintiff has also not exam­ined any witness in support of his case of signing only one deed for mortgage. Accordingly the learned Single Judge set aside the judgment of the lower appellate Court and sent the appeal back on remand to the lower appellate Court for re-hearing with liberty to both sides to put in evidence on execution of the deed of mortgage and on execution of four kabalas as alleged by the parties.<br/><br/>8. It did not take much effort on the part of Mr. Mahbubey Alam, learned Counsel for the defendant-appellants, that on both counts the High Court Division is obvious­ly in the wrong. First of all, the signature of the plaintiff in the four impugned kabalas is not dispute. The lower appellate Court com­pared these signatures with the signatures of the plaintiff in the plaint, deposition and Ext. A. When the plaintiff himself is a party to some kabalas a purely declaratory suit is not maintainable. The plaintiff must seek further consequential relief by way of can­cellation of the deeds. This is by now an established law and the High Court Division clearly erred in law in holding to the contrary.<br/><br/>9. It was again wholly wrong for the High Court Division to observe that the four deeds were not put into evidence. The trial Court says that the certified copies of the four deeds are Exts. 1-4. The appellate Court below clearly says that the appellants produced the original four deeds in the appellate Court, which compared the plaintiff's signatures in the plaint, deposition and registered agreement of sale Ext. A with his signatures in the four impugned deeds and found the signatures to be the same. The learned Single Judge did not even notice this.<br/><br/>10. The two Courts below concurrently found that the plaintiff failed to discharge the onus to prove that the impugned docu­ments were obtained by fraud. How could an order of remand be made to fill up the lacunae left by the plaintiff himself? The High Court Division also ignored the con­current finding of the Courts below that the defendants have been in possession of the suit land on the basis of the sale deeds in question. The order of remand was there­fore absolutely uncalled for. It shows total non-application of mind on the part of the learned Single Judge.<br/><br/>11. Mr. Mahbubey Alam has brought home all the points on which leave was granted and we have no hesitation therefore in allowing the appeal without any order as to costs. The lower appellate Court's judg­ment and decree are restored.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
