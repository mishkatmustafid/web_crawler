Tafazzul Islam J.-</strong> The plaintiff filed this petition for leave to appeal challenging the judgment and order dated 2.5.2004 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 2424 of 1998 discharging the Rule which was obtained against the judgment and decree dated 12.8.1997 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Narshingdi in Title Appeal No. 40 of 1995 affirming those of dated 31.8.1996 passed by the learned Assistant Judge, Shibpur, Narshingdi, in Title Suit No. 1 of 1996 decreeing the suit.<br/><br/>2. The respondent No.1, as plaintiff, instituted the above suit praying for a decree of permanent injunction in respect of the suit land comprising an area of 1.23 acres containing homestead as well as nal land in C.S. Plots Nos. 614, 631, 603/802 under C.S. Khatian No. 160 corresponding to Petty Khatian No. 20, S. A. khatian No. 170 and R.S. Khatian No.192 under Mouza 176 Bara Asrafpur in Police Station Shibpur, District Narshingdi. The trial court, after hearing, decreed the suit. On appeal the appellate court, upon hearing, dismissed the appeal. Then on revision the High Court Division, after hearing, discharged the Rule.<br/><br/>3. The learned counsel appearing for the defendant/petitioners submits that the High Court Division erred in law in not considering that the plaintiff did not implead all the co-sharers in the suit; there being defect of parties the suit was not maintainable; a decree for permanent injunction  can  not  be  passed  in  ejmali properties and the principles as laid down in the decisions, following which the High Court Division discharged the Rule, are not applicable in the present case as the facts and circumstances are distinguishable.<br/><br/>4. As it appears in the case of <strong><em>Erfan vs. Joinal Abedin</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>35 DLR (AD) 216</em></strong> it was held that "the rent receipts though not document of title are important items of evidence of possession and may be used as collateral evidence of title since possession generally follows title" and the trial court, on the basis of the rent receipts produced by the plaintiff, applying the above principle held that the plaintiff proved possession in the suit land. In the case of <strong><em>Pasharuddin vs. Ismail Mir</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>6 BLD 155</em></strong> it was held that "A suit for permanent injunction is maintainable till partition if the plaintiff is in exclusive possession of the ejmali land and the court need not enter into the complicated question of title. It is enough for the court to find who is in actual and exclusive possession of the suit land". The trial court having considered the C.S. Parcha No. 160, Ext.1, Petty Parcha No.20, Ext.2, R.S. Khatian No. 192 together with the rent receipts, relied on the above case to consider as to the circumstances under which a decree of permanent injunction should be passed and finding the exclusive possession of the plaintiff in the suit land held that the plaintiff was entitled to a decree for permanent injunction as for the purpose of decree for permanent injunction possession is the cardinal factor. The lower appellate after due, discussion, dismissed the appeal affirming the above findings. The High Court Division considering the above position and also on relying on the case of <strong><em>Rafizuddin vs. Molla Barman,</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>43 BLD(AD) 215</em></strong> where it has been held that, "In a simple suit for permanent injunction with regard to disputed land the relief is available to a person who is in possession. The court may require incidentally into the respective claims of the parties for determining whether the .plaintiffs is in possession of a dispute property and entitled to specific relief of permanent injunction" and also relying on the case of <strong><em>Pasharuddin Mir vs. Ismail Mir and others</em></strong> (Supra) where it was held that "in a suit for permanent injunction there is no question of defect of parties. Only those who threaten the plaintiff with dispossession are necessary parties" discharged the Rule.<br/><br/>5. It thus appears that the High Court Division on applying correct principles of law arrived at a correct finding. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner could not point out any misreading or non-consideration of the materials on record and/or any illegality or infirmity so as to call for interference from this Court.<br/>Accordingly the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
