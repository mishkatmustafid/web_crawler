The facts leading to the filing of this petition, are, in brief, that the respondent Nos.1 to 3 filed a suit being the Other Class Suit No.75 of 1996, in the Court of Assistant Judge, Sadar, Rangpur, praying for a decree for declaration that the <em>Nadabipatra</em> in respect of 0.23 acres of land in the suit-land is false and not bind­ing upon them. The present petitioner and other defendants contested the suit by filing written statements denying the materi­al averments made in the plaint. After hearing, the suit was decreed by the judg­ment and decree dated 26.10.1998.<br/><br/>3. The appeal being Other Appeal No. 4 of 1999, filed by the petitioner and other defendants, was dismissed by the judgment and decree dated 31.10.2000, passed by the Joint District Judge, Court No. 1, Rangpur. As such, they preferred a revisional application before the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 76 of 2001 but after hearing, the Rule was also discharged by the judgment and order dated 18.03.2009, concurring with the judgments and orders passed by the Courts below.<br/><br/>4. The learned Assistant Judge on consideration of the evidence on record found that the <em>Nadabi</em> deed is a forged one, that 0.1112 acres out of the suit-land was purchased by the plaintiff No.1 in his own name and the same was recorded in his name in the S.A. Record on the basis of his possession in the land and that the father of the defendants never raised any objection in that respect during his life time.<br/><br/>5. On appeal, the learned Subordinate Judge found that although the oral gift of Asimon Bibi, the recorded tenant, in favour of the plaintiff No.1 was not proved but his possession to the extant of half of 0.46 acres in Plot No. 1121 within Khatian No. 105 (Ext.3) was found to be recorded. The learned Judge found that the permissive possession of the plaintiff No.1 to the extent of 0.23 acres of land was never withdrawn either by Erfan Ali or the present defendants. He also found that the alleged <em>nadabi</em> was never acted upon. With these findings, the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment and decree passed by the Trial Court.<br/><br/>6. In revision, the High Court Division, concurred with the findings of fact arrived at by the Courts below.<br/><br/>7. Mr. Khondaker Saiful Huque, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner, fails to raise any apparent error or illegality in the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division.<br/>In the result, this petition for leave to appeal is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
