Joynul Abedin J.-</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 29.3.2005 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.4644 of 2003 discharging the rule affirming the judgment and decree dated 1.10.2003 passed by the learned Senior Assistant Judge, 1st Court, Bogra in Small Cause Court Suit No. 1 of 1998 decreeing the suit.<br/><br/>2. Short fact of the case is that one Abbas Ali Mondal, the predecessor in-interest of the respondent Nos. 1-7 as plaintiffs instituted Small Cause Court Suit No.1 of 1998 before the Senior Assistant Judge, First Court, Bogra impleading the peti­tioners and respondent Nos. 4-7 as defen­dants praying for a decree for recovery of khas possession upon evicting the defen­dants therefrom. The plaintiff asserted that the defendants lastly paid rent for the month of July and August, 1997 on 2.9.1997 and since then they did not pay any rent and became a habitual defaulter and undesirable tenant. The plaintiff also alleged that his eldest son, Md. Abdul Latif Mondal (since deceased), required the suit premises for starting his own business therein. The plaintiff issued a notice under section 106 of the Transfer of property Act on 14.1.1998 through his Advocate terminating the tenancy with the expiry of the month of February, 1998 but the defendants did not vacate the suit premises. Hence the suit was instituted.<br/><br/>3. The defendant Nos.1-5 contested the suit by filing a written statement contending amongst others that the original landlord Abbas Ali Mondal entered into an agreement for 5 years on payment of advance rent of Tk. 45,000/- for his treatment upon enhancing monthly rent at Tk. 750/- per month and such agreement was entered into on 2.9.1997. The contesting defendants also alleged that the defendant Nos.1-5 reconstructed the suit premises in 1989 at a costs of Tk.1,50,000/-.  The contesting defendants also contended that the original plaintiff having received the advance amount of Tk.45, 000/- was liable to adjust the same against the monthly rents and the defendant’s were therefore not a defaulter in respect of the suit premises. The contesting defendants further alleged that they purchased 4¼ decimals of land from the cosharer of the jote, Tafiran Bibi, and became owner in possession, of the suit premises and filed partition Suit No.116 of 1999 in the 1st Court of the Subordinate Judge, Bogra against the heirs of the original landlord Haji Abbas Ali Mondal and the plaintiff having learnt about the said suit instituted this false suit which is liable to be dismissed with costs.<br/><br/>4. The trial court framed necessary issues and on consideration of the evidence on record came to the finding that the defen­dants became defaulters. The trial court considered the plaintiffs plea of bonafide requirement and ultimately held that the plaintiff had proved their plea of bonafide requirement. Accordingly by judgment and decree dated 1.10.2003 the trial court decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiffs. In this background of the case, the defen­dant-petitioners moved the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 4644 of 2003 and obtained the rule and the same was eventually discharged by the High Court Division by the impugned judgment and order dated 29.3.2005.<br/><br/>5. Mr. Bivash Chandra Biswas, the learned Advocate-on-Record for the petitioners submits that in view of the admission in plaint by the plaintiff about his transfer of the suit premises on the basis of registered Heba-bil Ewaz to his eldest son the plaintiff had no locus standi to file the suit and as such the impugned judgment and order is illegal. He next submits that both the courts below committed an error in hold­ing that the written agreement dated 2.9.1997, Exhibit-Gha, clearly proves that rent for five years since 2.9.1997  to 31.8.2002 was paid in advance and as such the finding that the defendants are habitual defaulter can not be sustained in law. He further submits that the plaintiff was to prove the bonafide requirement by adducing cogent evidence but he failed to do so. He lastly submits that there is no bar in the Evidence Act or in the Code of Civil Procedure that after closing of evi­dence of the parties no documents could be filed and proved for the ends of justice. Hence the High Court Division committed an error in holding that the document filed after closing of the evidence should have been expunged.<br/><br/>6. We are not impressed by the submis­sions of Mr. Bivash Chandra Biswas. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court Division upon correct assessment of the evidence and materials on record arrived at a correct decision and rightly dismissed the civil revision war­ranting no interference by this court.<br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
