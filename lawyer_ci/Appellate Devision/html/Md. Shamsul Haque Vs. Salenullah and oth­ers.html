Leave was granted to consider as to whether the High Court Division erred in rejecting the revisional application summarily hold­ing that the proposed amendment would change the nature and character of the suit without con­sidering that the plaintiff's prayer for amend­ment was allowed in part by the trial Court and that the High court Division did not a at all con­sider the appellant's contention that the learned Subordinate Judge erroneously held that Other Suit No. 26 of 1983 of the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Cox's Bazar was not within the pecuniary jurisdiction of the said court.<br/><br/>3. The appellant filed the suit for partition. Subsequently on receipt of the written state­ment informing about a decree dated 08.08.1988 passed in Other Suit No. 26 of 1983 of the Court of Munsif at Cox's Bazar, the appellant filed an application for amendment of plaint for adding a prayer for a declaration of title and that the judgment and decree dated 08.08.1988 passed in Other Suit No. 26 of 1983 of the Court of Munsif, Cox's Bazar is fraudu­lent, void and not binding upon setting aside the said decree. The said application was allowed in part allowing the prayer for adding declara­tion of title but rejecting the prayer for amend­ment incorporating the prayer that the decree in Other Suit No. 26 of 1983 is fraudulent, void and not binding upon the plaintiff on the ground that the suit is beyond the pecuniary jurisdiction of the learned Subordinate Judge. The plaintiff unsuccessfully moved the High Court Division.<br/><br/>4. Mr. M. G. Bhuiyajn, the learned Advocate-on-Record appearing for the appel­lants submits that the plaintiff's suit being dec­laration of title, as it stands and the plaintiffs suit would be rendered not maintainable with­out a declaration that the decree for permanent injunction on Other Suit No. 26 of 1983 was fraudulent, void and not binding upon the plain­tiff inasmuch as the Court of the Joint District Judge (Subordinate Judge) is competent to dis­pose of the suit challenging a decree passed by the Subordinate Judge.<br/><br/>5. It revealed from the written statement filed by the respondent that the defendant in the suit obtained as decree for Permanente injunc­tion in Other Suit No. 26 of 1983 of the Court Munsif, Cox's Bazar. Accordingly the plaintiff filed an application for amendment of the plaint to incorporate prayer for declaration of title and for a further declaration that the decree of per­manent injunction in Other Suit No. 26 of 1983 of the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Cox's Bazar void, fraudulent and not binding upon the plaintiff stating that unless the amendment sought for is allowed the suit would be rendered not maintainable and would be an stumbling block in the matter of passing any decree for declaration of title and partition.<br/><br/>6. The learned Subordinate Judge by his judgment and order dated 24.10.91 allowed the prayer in part amending of the plaint for adding the prayer as the declaration of title but reject­ing the rest on the ground that the decree sought to be declared void is of the Senior Assistant Judge Cox's Bazar and is not amenable within the jurisdiction of the Court.<br/><br/>7. The plaintiff's suit as it stands after the partial amendment is a suit for declaration of title and partition. A decree for declaration of title could not be given unless the plaintiff's found to be in possession or in suit for declara­tion of title and partition that the plaintiff's enti­tled to a declaration of title if he is in joint pos­session with his co-sharers. But such decree would be barred if the plaintiff is not found to be in possession because of the decree for per­manent injunction in Other Suit No. 26 of 1983. Thus unless the decree for permanent injunction in Other Suit No. 26 of 1983 is set aside, no suit for declaration of title is maintainable under the provision of section 42 of the Specific Relief Act. Even in a suit if it is found that the plain­tiff has title but the suit would not be maintain­able if the plaintiff is found be out of posses­sion.<br/><br/>8. The defendant respondent has obtained <em>a </em>decree for permanent injunction in Other Suit No. 26 of 1983 of the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Cox’s Bazar. The Suit for permanent injunction is essentially a suit for possession upon a finding of possession of the plaintiff, no matter what is the nature or character of title to the suit land. In the instant case, plaintiff's suit for declaration of title and partition would surly be not maintainable pursuant to the decree for permanent injunction in Other Suit No. 26 of 1983. Thus of necessity the plaintiff has to declare the decree in Other Suit No. 26 of 1983 to be void, fraudulent and not binding upon the plaintiff and unless that decree is set aside the plaintiff would not be able to obtain the decree as prayed for. Thus the decree for permanent injunction being essentially a decree for posses­sion and would not bar a suit for declaration of title upon declaration that the decree for perma­nent injunction obtained on Other Suit No. 26 of 1983 is void, fraudulent and not binding.<br/><br/>9. An amendment may be allowed at any stage of the proceeding to alter or amend the pleading in such manner and on such terms as may be just and necessary for the purpose of determining the real question in controversy between the parties. The trial Court disallowed part of the prayer for amendment on the ground that that the decree sought to be incorporated by way of amendment is of the Senior Assistant Judge having pecuniary jurisdiction. But instant case being having the higher pecuniary jurisdic­tion is also entitled under law to decide the suit involving a decree in a suit with less pecuniary value. The authority to decide a case at all and not the decision rendered therein is what makes up jurisdiction. Before a Court can be held to have jurisdiction to decide a suit it must not only have jurisdiction to try the suit but must also have the authority to pass the desired decree. Thus objection as to territorial jurisdic­tion does not stand on the same footing as objection to the competence of a Court to try a case. The plaintiff in a suit is at liberty to value his suit both for territorial and pecuniary juris­diction but the Court under the Code of Civil procedure has a right to correct the plaintiff’s valuation.<br/><br/>10. Thus the distinction between want of jurisdiction and irregular exercise of jurisdic­tion or assumption of jurisdiction should be borne in mind as in the former the decree is a nullity but in latter case it is not and the error could be remedied in appeal. What is relevant in the instant case is whether the learned Subordinate Judge could have jurisdiction to grant the relief in the suit as prayed for in Other Suit No. 96 of 1983. Thus where the decree in Other Suit No. 26 of 1983 is challenged in the instant suit the judgment rendered will not be without jurisdiction and any decree by the Subordinate Judge with the prayer against a suit of the Munsif's Court would not render the decree void for want of pecuniary jurisdiction unless it had resulted in absolute failure of jus­tice.<br/><br/>11. The policy of the legislature has been to treat objections as to jurisdiction both territori­al or pecuniary as purely technical for the rea­son that section 21 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that no objection as to the place of suing shall be allowed unless such objection was taken at the earliest stage but objection not having been taken would not viti­ate the trial. Similarly objection as to pecuniary jurisdiction which is for the purpose of Court fee and availing a forum of appeal/ revision is mostly of formal nature and the Court with higher pecuniary jurisdiction could decide a suit of lower pecuniary value and would not render the decree void. It is also desirable that the grievance of the plaintiff would be resolved in a single suit. Thus if the Subordinate Judge hears, adjudicate and adjudge the decree in Other Suit No. 26 of 1983 as void or otherwise, the decree could not be void for want of jurisdiction, rather the issues involved in the suit could be conve­niently dealt, decided and determined by a higher forum i.e. the Subordinate Judge without any risk or chance of any conflicting decision.<br/>In view of the above, this appeal is allowed without any order as to cost.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
