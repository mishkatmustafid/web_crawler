Mudassir Husain CJ. -</strong> This civil petition for leave to appeal, at the instance of defendant Nos. 1 and 2, is directed against the judgment and order dated 26-06-2002 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 3458 of 1997 making the Rule absolute.<br/><br/>2. Facts, leading to this petition, are that the plaintiff-respondent instituted Other Class Suit No. 109 of 1985 praying for permanent injunction restraining the defendants from entering into the suit land or from dispossessing him from the suit land in the Court of Assistant Judge, Ghatail, Tangail. The case of the plaintiff was that Goher Sheikh was the sole owner of the land in C.S. Khatian No. 470 including suit plot No. 601 while his son Modhu Skeikh was in possession. Modhu Skeikh died leaving behind 3 (three) sons namely (1) Jawahar Ali, (2) Bachiruddin and (3) Ahammad Ali, who transferred .09½ decimals of land out of 29 decimals of land in favour of C &amp; B authority about 45/46 years back and they remained the owner in possession of the rest .19½ dec­imals of land which they transferred to the Bali Mamud Munshi on 04-11-1943. While Bali Mamud Munshi being in pos­session of the said land by constructing house thereon and thereafter, he trans­ferred the same to the plaintiff by a sale deed being Deed No. 3120 dated 18-04-1957 and delivered possession thereof to him and since the dated of purchase the plaintiff has been in possession of the suit land with his family member by con­structing a house thereon. Subsequently, the plaintiff sold .04 decimals of land out of his aforesaid purchased land to proforma-defendant No. 9 The plaintiff mutated his name and it was duly recorded in the R.O.R. Khatian vide order dated 22-10-1976 passed in Miscellaneous Case No. 1453 (ix-1=6976). The plaintiff has shops in the suit land and he has been paying rent and taxes to the Government; that the defendants threatened to dispossess the plaintiff from the suit land on 28-10-1985 and they also threatened that they would get their names recorded in respect of the suit land with the help of defendant No. 8. Therefore, the plaintiff felt compelled to file the suit.<br/><br/>3. The defendant-petitioners contested the suit by filing joint written statement deny­ing all material allegations made in the plaint. The positive case of the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 is that Goher Sheikh was the owner of .29 decimals of land of C.S. Plot No.60 of C.S. Khatian No. 470 and the said Goher Sheikh died leaving behind one son Modhu Sheikh and 2 daughters namely Rubia Bewa and Shirin Bewa but the land of the said plot was recorded wrongly in the name of Modhu Sheikh alone although the 2(two) daughters of Goher Sheikh have been enjoying and possessing their portion in the said plot. Mohdu Sheikh became the owner of 14.12 decimals of land and Rubia and Shirin Bewa together became the owner of 14½  decimals of land left by their father late Goher Sheik and Modhu Sheikh died leaving behind 3 (three) sons namely Jowahar Ali, Basiruddin and Ahmed Ali and 2 (two) daughters namely Amirun and Dudhjan and accordingly the 3(three) sons of Modhu Sheikh became the owner of .03<sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> decimals of land each and two daughters became the owner of .011<sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub>  decimals of land each; that the said Jawahar Ali, Basiruddin and Ahmmed Ali sold their portions of the suit plot to Jamal Uddin Khan by registered kabala dated 31-01-1959. Shirin Bewa died leaving behind a son named Shahed Ali and three daughters; that Shaheb Ali sold 1.12 decimals of land to Jamal Uddin by a registered deed dated 05-02-1969 and thereby Jamal Uddin became the owner of .03 decimals of land and he sold the same to defendant No.2 Mokshed Ali by a registered kabala dated 06-07-1972. The Dudhjan sold .01 decimals of land to Rahij Uddin by a registered kabala dated 20-05-1984 and after purchase he con­structed pucca shop over the suit land who transferred the same to defendant No. 1, Shamsul Haq by a <em>Heba-bil-Ewaz</em> deed dated 11-07-1985. In this way, defendant No.1 and 2 have been in possession of the specified area in the southern part of the suit land.<br/><br/>4. Upon hearing the parties, the trial Court decreed the suit by his judgment and order dated 26-06-2002 and against which, the petitioner preferred Other Class Appeal No. 186 of 1988 before the District Judge, Tangail and the appeal was heard by the learned Subordinate Judge, Second Court, Tangail, who allowed the appeal and reversed the judgment of the trial Court on 09-06-1997. Against the aforesaid appellate judgment of reversal dated 09-06-1997, the plaintiff-respondent filed the above Civil Revision before the High Court Division; that the High Court Division made the Rule absolute by the impugned judgment as aforesaid. Hence, is this leave-petition.<br/>5. Mr. Md. Nawab Ali, the learned Advocate-on-Record, appearing for the petitioner having placed before us the impugned judgment of the High Court Division as well as the judgments of the Courts below, submitted that the plaintiff failed to prove his exclusive possession in the suit land and this aspect has been over looked by the trial Court as well as by the High Court Division and as such the impugned judgment of the High Court Division is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>6. Learned Advocate-on-Record next con­tended that the trial Court upon misread­ing and misconstruing the evidence on record erroneously held that the plaintiff proved his title and possession and in such view of the matter, the findings and deci­sions of the High Court Division being erroneous can not be sustained in law. We have heard the learned Advocate-on-Record and considered his submission. On perusal of the impugned judgment of the High Court Division, we find that the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division having meticulously assessed and considered the material on record held as follows:<br/>"It is well settled proposition of law that in a suit of permanent injunction the sole question to be seen is the exclusive pos­session of the plaintiff the suit land as well as his prima-facie title. From the dis­cussions made above it is clear that the plaintiff proved his exclusive possession in the suit land and also his prima-facie title therein.<br/>So far as the specification of the suit prop­erty is concerned it appears that along with the plaint the plaintiff filed a Kalami Noksha wherein the suit land has been clearly specified. In course of hearing, the learned Advocate appearing for the peti­tioner submitted that in view of the fact that the suit property was clearly specified in the 'Kalami Noksha' which was a part of the schedule to the plaint it could not be said that the suit land was vague but the appellate Court totally failed to consider the said "Kalami Noksha”. Therefore, the trial Court rightly decreed the suit."<br/><br/>7. In the aforesaid premises, we find no legal infirmity to differ with the above findings of the High Court Division. This petition merits no consideration. Accordingly, it is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
