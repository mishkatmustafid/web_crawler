Short facts are that the plaintiffs instituted Partition Suit No. 107 of 1992 in the Court of Assistant Judge, Saturia, Manikganj contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit land measuring 1.88 acres of C.S. Khatian No.395 belonged to one Shumai Mallik who died leaving wife Misran Bewa, one son Malu Mallik and daughters Shoyjan and Shonajan. Shoyjan died leaving her husband Kasimuddin, Shamsujaman as his son and daughter Atarjan. Malu Mallik died childless and his share devolved upon his sister Shonajan. Thereafter, Shonajan transferred 1.20 decimals of land to her sister's son Shamsuddin by a registered deed of gift dated 04.11.1936. Shamsuddin and Atarjan sold the suit land to Abdul Wahed, the predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiff. In this way the plaintiffs became owner of the suit land.<br/><br/>3. The defendant Nos.1-3 contested the suit by filing written statement denying the material allegations made in the plaint. Their case is that the suit land belonged to Shumai Mallik who died leaving wife Misran and son Malu Mallik and two daughters Gedi and Shoyjan. He had no daughter named Shonajan. After the death of Misran and Malu, Gedi and Shoyjan inherited their share. Gedi died leaving son Naimuddin and daughter Piarjan. Piarjan sold. 94 acres of land to defendant Nos.1-3 by a   registered kabala dated 11.12.1967. In this way the defendant Nos.1-3 become    owner and are in possession.<br/><br/>4. We have heard Shahidul Islam, learned Advocate for the petitioner and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/><br/>5. It appears that by the kabala in favour of plaintiffs' predecessor 1.20 acres of land was transferred by way of sale and the possession of plaintiffs was not disputed and accordingly the High Court Division held that the plaintiffs arc entitled to get a decree in respect of 1.20 acres of land but the appellate court below gave a decree for 1.25 acres of land which was illegal because they can not get land in excess of what has   been conveyed in  favour  of  their predecessor by the kabala from Shamsuddin and Atarjan.<br/><br/>6. In the aforesaid facts and circumstances, we find no illegality in the judgment of the High Court Division.<br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
