Short fact of the plaint case is that 'Kha' schedule lands measuring an area of 2.39 acres belonged to Doyel Bibi, Jasiron Bibi, Bariron Bibi and Bacchani Bibi. They paid rents to the ex-landlord and subsequently surrendered the said lands to the landlord Tasiruddin Sarkar. The land­lord possessed the said lands for some time and subsequently he granted pattan to Ambaruddin and Genda Mahmud. Thereafter said tenants sold the same to Saiab Uddin, Sharof Uddin and Wahab Uddin by deed dated 13th January, 1940. The R.S. Record was prepared in the name of Sharof Uddin and Wahab Uddin, the predecessors of the defendant Nos. 2 to 13. During the war of liberation, all the title deeds were destroyed. The defendant Nos. 2-12 sold the 'Ka' schedule lands out of 'Kha' schedule to the plaintiffs by different deeds. On 10th September, 1990, the plaintiffs came to know for the first time from the defendant No.1 that he obtained an <em>ex parte</em> decree in Other Class Suit No.139 of 1984. On the basis of such information, they procured a copy of the judgment in Miscellaneous Appeal No.86 of 1987 arose out of the suit and came to know about the suit. The said <em>ex parte </em>decree is not binding upon the plaintiffs. The defendant No.1 has no right, title and interest in the suit lands, who forcefully dispossessed the plaintiffs from the 'Ka' schedule lands on 2nd January, 1991. Hence the suit.<br/><br/>4. The defendant No.1 contested the suit by filing a written statement. His case in short is that one Jallad Sheikh owned of the suit lands, who died leaving behind wife Doyel Bibi and three daughters, namely Jasrion, Basiron and Bacchoni. The C.S. record was also prepared in their names. Subsequently Doyel Bibi died leaving daughter's daughter Tepri Bibi. Jasiron died leaving son, the defendant No.1 and Basiron died leaving two sons Baher and Meher. Defendant No.1 pur­chased .80 acres of land from Tepri Bibi and .80 acres of land from Baher and Meher by deeds dated 5th June, 1983 and 9th June, 1983, respectively. In this way the defendant No.1 is the exclusive owner by way of inheritance and purchase. The R. S. Khatian having been wrongly pre­pared in the names of Sharof Uddin and Wahab Uddin, the defendant No.1 institut­ed Other Class Suit No.419 of 1983 in the First Court of Munsif, Rangpur which was renumbered as Other Class Suit No.139 of 1984. The suit was decreed <em>ex parte</em> on 22nd July, 1987. The defendants of that suit thereupon instituted Miscellaneous Case No.3 of 1987 under Order 9 Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure for setting aside the <em>ex parte</em> decree. On being are unsuccessful, they preferred Miscellaneous Appeal No.86 of 1987 which was also dismissed for default on 15th May, 1990. During the pendency of the said cases, the plaintiffs procured the collusive deeds from the judgment debtors. The plaintiffs have no right, title and interest in the suit lands.<br/><br/>5. The learned Assistant Judge on consideration of the evidence on record by judgment and order dated 10th September, 1994, decreed the suit in part holding that the plaintiffs came to Court with defective title but their predecessors had possession in the suit lands, that the plaintiffs have been in possession thereon, that the documentary evidence of the plaintiffs  are more stronger than that of the defendant, that the defendant dispossessed the plaintiffs during the pendency of the suit and erected a house subsequently and that the plaintiffs are entitled to get a decree as prayed  for. With these findings, the learned Subordinate Judge decreed the suit in respect of 1.2212 acres of land and directed the defendant No.1 to vacate possession therefrom.<br/><br/>6. On appeal by the defendant No.1 being Other Class Suit No.206 of 1994 from the aforesaid judgment and decree, the learned Additional District Judge, First Court, Rangpur, who heard the said appeal by judgment and order dated 28th November, 2002, reversed the findings of the trial Court and dismissed the suit. The Court of Appeal below held that the plaintiffs failed to prove their claim that the tenants Doyel Bibi and others surrendered possession in favour of the plaintiffs' land­lord Tasiruddin Sarkar, that Jasiron Bibi being the heir of C.S. recorded tenant inherited the suit lands from whom the defendant No.1 accrued title in the suit lands. The Court of Appeal below further held that the plaintiffs also failed to prove that Ambar and Ganda took pattan of the suit lands from the ex-landlord and therefore, the plaintiffs acquired no title on the basis of purchase from Sharof Uddin and Wahab Uddin and that the plaintiffs pur­chased the suit land during pendency of the cases and litigations arose out of Other Class Suit No.139 of 1984.<br/><br/>7. Being aggrieved by the said judgment and order, the plaintiffs moved the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.1642 of 2003. A single Bench of the High Court Division by judgment and order dated 28<sup>th</sup> October, 2008, made the rule absolute and restored those of the trial court by setting aside the judgment and order of the court of appeal below. The learned Judge of the High Court Division observed that the decree passed in Other Class Suit No.139 of 1984 is not binding upon the plaintiffs, that the defendant No.1 did not make any statement that he constructed homestead on the suit lands prior to the institution of the suit, that though P.Ws.3, 4 and 6 failed to mention the date of dispossession but that the evi­dence of P.Ws. 1-5 and 7 are more stronger than those of the defendant No. 1.<br/><br/>8. Mr. A. J. Mohammad Ali, the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioners con­tended that the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division erred in law interfer­ing with the findings of fact arrived at by the Court of Appeal below and therefore, the learned Judge of the High Court Division exceeded its jurisdiction while exercising revisional power. The learned counsel further contended that the learned Single Bench erred in law in failing to consider that the plaintiffs have purchased the suit lands during the pendency of Miscellaneous Appeal No. 86 of 1987 arose out of Other Class Suit No.139 of 1984 and therefore, their claim of title on the basis of deeds are hit by the principles <em>lis pendens</em>. The learned Counsel further contended that the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division erred in law in holding that the evidence regarding the possession and dispossession adduced by the plaintiffs are more stronger than those of the defendant, in failing to consider that the Court of Appeal below on a proper appreciation of the evidence on record found the defendant's possession which finding being based on assessment of the evidence on record is binding upon the High Court Division and that the learned Judge of the High Court Division failed to notice that in a suit for declaration under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, the Court can not pass a decree for recovery of khas possession under section 9 of the Specific Relief Act.<br/><br/>9. We find substance in the contentions of the learned Counsel for the petitioners. Leave is, therefore, granted on the addi­tional grounds as follows:<br/>"I. For that out of the 7 plaintiffs seek­ing declaration that the <em>ex parte </em>decree in Title Suit No.139 of 1984 is not binding upon them in respect of 1.2212 acres of the suit land, the trial court gave declaration only in favour of plaintiff No. 3 to the extent of .25 acres of the suit land, which was reversed by the Appellate Court but the High Court Division without adverting to the said findings of the courts below simply held that the plaintiffs have been able to prove the fact that the decree passed in Title Suit No. 139 of 1984 is not binding upon them though the courts below clearly held that except for the case of plaintiff No. 3, the other plaintiffs pur­chases were hit by <em>lis pendens</em> and this has resulted an error in the decision of the case on its merits.<br/>II. For that the Appellate Court having reversed the findings of the trial court on the question of possession and dis­possession, made on treating the case as one under section 9 of the Specific Relief Act, the High Court Division erred in holding "In view of the above, I am constrained to hold that the evi­dence of possession and dispossession as adduced by the P.Ws. 1-5, P.W.7 are more stronger and reliable than that of the defendant. Their evidences inspired me to hold that the plaintiffs were in possession in the suit land and were dispossessed during the penden­cy of the suit". Because appraisal of evidence and disturbing the finding of fact in revisional jurisdiction is only permissible when the finding of fact is based on misreading or non-consider­ation of evidence by the court of fact.<br/>III. For that having regard to the frame of the suit, namely, <em>ex parte</em> decree is not binding upon the plain­tiffs and for eviction and the trial court having granted the declaration only in respect of plaintiff No. 3 but not granted by the Appellate Court on the ground that the transfers were hit by <em>lis pendens</em>, the High Court Division erred in ignoring the same on the plea of dispossession having occurred during the pendency of the suit overlooking that the transfers in favour of the plaintiffs were hit by <em>lis pendens</em>."<br/>Security of Tk.1000/- is to be deposited within one month.<br/>Preparation of paper book is dispensed with as prayed for.<br/>The petitioner is permitted to add additional grounds.<br/>The order of <em>status quo</em> granted earlier by this court shall continue till disposal of the appeal.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
