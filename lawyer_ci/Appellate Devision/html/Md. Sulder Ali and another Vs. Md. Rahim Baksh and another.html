Abdul Matin J. -</strong> This petition for leave to appeal at the instance of Md. Sulder Ali and another pre-emptee petitioner is directed against the judgment and order dated 10.04.2006 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 6292 of 2002 discharging the Rule on con­test.<br/><br/>2. The facts, in short, are that the pre-emptee petitioner No.1 challenged the judgment and other dated 12.10.2002 passed by learned Joint District Judge, 2nd Court, Kurigram in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 2 of 2000 affirming judgment and order dated 30.11.1999 passed by learned assistant Judge, Sadar Kurigram in mis­cellaneous Case No. 48 of 1996 allowing pre-emption.<br/><br/>3. The pre-emptor respondent No. 1 filed the miscellaneous Case No. 48 of 1996 in order to have the case land by way of pre­emption stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that he is a co-sharer tenant in the case land by inheri­tance. The respondent No. 2 (vendor) transferred the case land by a registered kabala dated 11.07.1996 for consideration of Tk. 40,000/-to the pre-emptee peti­tioners, pre-emptee No.1 is a stranger purchaser; no notice was served upon the pre-emptor. The pre-emptor first came to know about the transfer on 01.10.1996. The pre-emptor has only 8/10 bighas of land and if the pre-emptor gets the case land by way of pre-emption, his ceiling will not exceed.<br/><br/>4. The pre-emptee petitioner No. 1 con­tested the miscellaneous Case by filing written objection denying all the material allegations made in the application for pre-emption. The case of the pre-emptee petitioner No. 1 in short is that the pre-emptor acted as the negotiator when pre-emptee petitioner no. 1 purchased the case land. The pre-emptor respondent No.1 knew about the transfer and he assured the pre-emptee petitioner No.1 that he would not file any case for pre-emption, a shalish was held and in that shalish the pre-emp­tor executed an 'Angikarnama' in favour of pre-emptee petitioner no.1 and also assured that he would not file any case for pre-emption. The pre-emptor knew about the transfer and suppressing all those facts, he filed the pre-emption case and as such the case is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>5. The learned Senior Assistant Judge, Sadar Kurigram after considering evi­dence and after hearing both the sides allowed the pre-emption case by its judg­ment and    order dated 30.11.1999. Thereafter the pre-emptee petitioner No. filed miscellaneous Appeal No. 2 of 2001 before the learned District Judge, Kurigram, Chattenging the said judgment and order dated 30.11.1999 and the same was transferred to the 2nd court of learned joint District judge, Kurigram for hearing and disposal. Accordingly the said miscel­laneous Appeal was heard and the learned appellate court affirmed the judgment and order of the trial court by its judgment and order dated 12.10.2002. Thereafter the pre-emptee petitioner No.1 preferred a Civil Revision being No. 6292 of 2002 before the High Court High Court Division challenging the judgment and order dated 12.10.2002 and the same was heard by a Single Bench of the High Court Division on 06.04.2006 and the Court passed the impugned judgment and order on 10.04.2006 discharging Rule on con­test.<br/><br/>6. The learned Advocate-on-Record for the petitioners submits that the case land originally belonged to Kasimuddin who died leaving behind the pre-emptor and the vendor as heirs; that the vendor name­ly, Most. Kachuron Bibi sold out the case land to the pre-emptee No. 1 and 2 on acceptance of proper consideration of money at the mediation of the pre-emptor. The pre-emptor also sold .48 acres of land out of the case holding to the pre-emptees by a kabala dated 05.09.1990. After pur­chase of the case land by the pre-emptees, the pre-emptor threatened the pre-emptees giving out that he would file a case for pre-emption which is illegal and the Judge of the High Court Division has committed error of law in discharging the Rule.<br/><br/>7. The case of the petitioner is that there was a shalish and as per verdict of shalish the petitioner gave Tk. 5,000/- to the pre-emptor and the pre-emptor promised not to file any pre-emption case for the land in question, but the petitioner failed to prove such assertion in any court and all the courts below concurrently held that the petitioner is a co-sharer and failed the case within time after performing all within the formalities and allowed pre-emption in favour of the respondent and decided the case on correct principle of law and fact.<br/>We find no merit in this petition which is accordingly dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
