The facts leading to the case are that the petitioner-predecessor-in-interest as the plaintiff filed a Title Suit No.210 of 1980 for specific performance of contract in the 2nd Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Narayanganj stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit property originally belongs to princi­ple defendant No.1 who entered into a contract to sell the same to the plaintiff on 15th Falgoon 1384 B.S. at a consideration of TK.5,000.00 only and the defendant No.1 also received TK.2000.00 as bainapatra on that day out of the consideration amount in presence of Magrab Ali who was an intimate friend of the plaintiff and also negotiated and settled the price of the suit land and the plaintiff in good faith did not demand the receipt of the payment. Defendant No.1, Falani Begum was the full sister of aforesaid Magrab Ali who assured and promised the execution and registration of the saf-kabala, in favour of<br/>the plaintiff Defendant No.1 handed over the possession of suit land to the plaintiff who filled up earth and constructed a house in the suit land. The plaintiff has been in possession in the suit land. He offered balance amount of TK.3000.00 but the principal defendant No.1 did not receive the same and on some flimsy grounds had been deferring the execution and registration of the kabala. Hence the suit.<br/><br/>3.  The defendant No.1 contested the suit denying the material allegation made in the plaint contending, inter-alia, that the suit is not maintainable and that the suit is false. The defendants' case, in short, is that defendant No.1 became owner and pos­sessor of 8 (eight) decimals of the suit plot by inheritance and was in possession of northern most portion of suit property and her full sister Fulmala got the adjacent southern portion covering an area of 8 decimals of land sold to the plaintiff and Okiluddin on 08.07.1978 and delivered possession to the plaintiff and his co-pur­chaser. The plaintiff and Okiluddin erect­ing house had been residing there. There was no contract for sale with the plaintiff and defendant No.1 sold the suit land to defendant Nos.2 and 3 on receipt of the consideration of TK.25, 000.00 by kabala on 21.05.1979 and delivered possession to them. The defendant Nos.2 and 3 have been in possession in the suit land. The defendant No.1 never entered into any contract for sale with the plaintiff and the suit was thus liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>4. Mr. Muhammad Nazrul Islam, learned Counsel, appearing for the petitioners sub­mitted that the High Court Division based its findings on surmise, conjecture and extraneous circumstances for which the findings are liable to be struck down; that the High Court Division committed a grave error of Taw occasioning failure of justice in not finding to the effect that the appellate Court below committed illegali­ty in reversing the sound judgment and decree of the trial Court without reversing the finding and observation of the trial Court and as such it was not at all a prop­er judgment of reversal; that the appellate Court misconstrued and misread the evi­dence by holding wrongly of the talk of the predecessor of the present petitioners of sale with defendant No. 1 and also tak­ing over possession of the suit land and found contradiction with regard to the agreement of sale and statements of P.W.'s; that the appellate Court failed to understand and analyse the written state­ment filed by the defendant No.1 but wrongly considered that it was filed by all the defendants although D.W.3 categori­cally deposed that he received the sum­mons but did not file written statement.<br/><br/>5. It appears from the record that there are discrepancies in the evidence of P.W.'s and clear deviation from the pleadings which the trial Court has failed to consider. The place of talk, amount of down payment and presence of the witnesses as asserted in the pleading were not supported by the P.W.'s. The appellate Court has rightly considered the discrepancies and reversed the judgment and decree of the trial Court.<br/><br/>6. In view of the above, the submissions of the learned Counsel for the petitioners deserve no consideration.<br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
