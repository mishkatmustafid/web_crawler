No. 894 of 1968.)<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Judgment</strong></span><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Shahabuddin Ahmed J.- </strong>In this appeal by special leave the question raised is whether the appellant is a "non-agricultural tenant" within the meaning of section 2(5) of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949 and is entitled to protection under section 7 of the said Act.<br/><br/>2. Respondents-plaintiffs filed Title Suit No. 51 of 1965 in the 3rd Court of Munsif, Jessore, for ejectment of the appellant and recovery of khas possession of the suit land. The suit land lies within the Jessore Municipal Area and it ad­mittedly belongs to the plaintiffs. Their case is that the defendant-appellant was their monthly bharatia-tenant in respect of the structures thereon—a tin shed hut and two golpata huts at a monthly rent of Tk. 15/- which was subsequently raised to Tk. 20/- per month. The plaintiffs require the suit land for constructing pucca structures for their own use; in due course they served a notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act upon the defendant terminating the tenancy, but he did not vacate the premises. Defendant (No. 1) contested the suit by filing a written statement. His case is the original bharatia tenancy ceased to exist when the structures were destroyed by fire. He then took lease of the vacant suit land under a written agreement at the monthly rent of Tk. 15/- and constructed a C.I. sheet hut thereon with his own materials, to which he added a pucca privy later on. The new tenancy, he contends, is in respect of the suit land which is a non-agricultural land, he is not a bharatia tenant in respect of the structures, he has been in possession of the land for ever 30 years and as such he is protected from eviction except on the ground of viola­tion of the terms of the tenancy as laid down in section 7(5) of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act.<br/><br/>3. The trial Court on consideration of evidence found that after destruction of the original tenancy by fire a new bharatia tenancy more or less on the same terms and conditions was created. That suit land was not leased out, but on the vacant suit land the defendant constructed a tin shed with his materials but with "landlord's permission" on condition that he would regularly pay monthly rent for his use and occupation of the huts and would vacate the land and remove the structures whenever the landlord required the land for making pucca construction. On these findings, the trial Court decreed the suit directing his ejectment subject to his right to remove his materials used in constructing the huts. On appeal, the learned Subordinate Judge rever­sed the findings and held that since the structures were constructed with the tenant's own materials and since the lease Agreement, Ext. B, refers to "lease of the land itself", the tenant was in fact a non-agricultural tenant for a period of over 12 years, and as such he is protected from ejectment under section 7 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act. On this finding the appeal was allowed and the suit was dismissed. But the learned Single judge of the High Court Division in second appeal (S. A. No. 894 of 1968) reversed the lower Appellate Court's decision and restored that of the trial Court, thus, finally decreeing the suit for ejectment.<br/><br/>4. There is no dispute that the suit land belonged to the respondents whose father had raised some structures thereon and inducted the appellant as a bharatia tenant from month to month. This tenancy continued till destruction of the entire structures by an accidental fire, a fact about which there is also no dispute. On destruction of premises by fire the tenancy ceases to exist at the option of the tenant, as the "doctrine of frustration" under section 108 of the Transfer of Property Act applies to cases of lease. But the respon­dent's contention is that the monthly tenancy was revived when fresh construction was made and a new agreement was entered into between them. Respondents do not deny that the new structures—a tin-shed and two golpata huts—were raised with their per­mission and approval by the tenant using his "own materials" but contend that erection of the new structure did not change the character of the tenancy when the con­struction was made by the appellant with their permission subject to the condition that in case they would require the land for making pucca construction, the tenant appellant would vacate the premises after removing his materials. The land itself, it is contended, was never leased out.<br/><br/>5. Mr. Asrarul Hossain, learned Advocate for the appellant, contends that after destr­uction of the original structures the monthly tenancy ceased to exist, and in support of this contention he has referred to a decision of the Calcutta High Court in the case of <strong><em>Khitish Chandra Mondal Vs Shiba Rani Devi AIR 1956 Cal 441</em></strong>. The principle of law followed in that case is not disputed in the instant case since both the parties are relying upon a fresh agreement entered into by them after destruction of the old structures by fire. Here the tenant is found to have reconstructed the premises with landlord's permission, using his own materials and continued to pay monthly rent though at a higher rate, which was tagged with the value of the land. The question is whether the using of his own materials by itself makes him tenant of the land and not of the structures only. There are two Agreements Ext. 2, and Ext. B, bearing the same date, 1st Baishak 1358 B.S. and it is these Agreements on whose true construction fate of the case depends largely.<br/><br/>6. Both the Agreements are "bharapatra" fvov cÎ. This clearly indicates that tenancy created is a monthly bharatia tenancy. Rent fixed was Tk. 5/- per month likely to be enhanced if the value of the land increased. The rent was raised to Tk. 20/- when a pucca privy was subsequently added to structures. Mr. Asrarul Hossain contends that as Ext B, the suit-land was leased out. But the words used there are that Rwg fvov †`Iqv nBj. This sounds absurd, for when a land is leased it is called BRviv e‡›`ve¯— in Bengali. It is not called fvov Secondly if the land were leased out, the tenant would not have been subjected to increase in the rate of mon­thly rent of the structures. In the rent re­ceipts, particularly in the Deposit of rent with the Rent Controller—the word monthly "bhara" was used. The land-lords have been paying Municipal taxes, government taxes and their names have been recorded in all official documents. The tenant never paid such dues not ever made any attempt to mutate his name in khatian Municipal Register. Section 2(5) of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act provides that "Non-Agricultural tenant" does not include any person who holds any land on which any premises occupied by such person are situated, if such premises have been created or are owned by the person to whom such occupation is liable to pay rent for such occupation. Mere "using of his own materials” does not make the tenant owner of the land as well as the structures. The materials were used because the landlords were not in position to procure or purchase them at that time, but they gave permission for using these materials on specific condition that the tenant would remove his materials whenever the landlords require the land for making pucca construction. Had the land been leased out many other consequences would have followed, such as yearly rent of the land would have been paid by the tenant to Government on state acquisition, his name would have been recorded in Muni­cipal Registrars and Government’s Khatians. Mr. Asrarul Hossain has based his arguments on the Agreement, Ext B, which shows that the land along with the structures was leased out. If the land had been taken lease of, landlord's permission for construction would not have been necessary. Secondly, this Agreement, Ext-B. was styled "Bhara—Patra" in Bengali Ext-2, the other Agreement shows that usual monthly bhara-tenancy was creat­ed. Both the documents have been considered by the trial Court, but the lower Appellate Court considered only, Ext-B, totally ignoring Ext-2, and other evidence, such as rent recei­pts, record-on-rights. Non-consideration of the materials evidence by the lower Appellate Court has exposed its finding to attack in second appeal.<br/><br/>7. Mr. Asrarul Hossain's argument is based on interpretation of section 7(5) of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act. I do not think that interpretation of this is very much neces­sary in this case for fate of this case depends upon the finding as to whether under the Agreement Ext. 2 and Ext B, the land itself was leased out or only the premises thereon was leased out. On consideration of these two documents we have no hesitation to hold that High Court Division correctly held that the land was not leased out but the premises thereupon was leased on monthly basis. Therefore, continuous occupation of the premises for over 12 years by the tenant did not bring him within the category of "Non-Agricultural tenants" and as such the protec­tion under section 7 is not available to him. We find nothing to interfere with the High Court Division's decision.<br/><br/>8. The appeal is therefore dismissed, without however any order as to costs.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
