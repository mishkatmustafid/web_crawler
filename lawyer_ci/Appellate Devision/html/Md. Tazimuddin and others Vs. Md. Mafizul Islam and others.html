Abdul Matin J. -</strong> This review petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 29.05.2008 passed by this Division in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 1642 of 2007 dis­missing the petition for leave to appeal.<br/><br/>2. The facts, in short, are that the prede­cessor of respondent Nos.1-3 Md. Moslemuddin instituted a suit being Title Suit No. 20 of 1989 in the Court of the learned Senior Assistant Judge, Mithapukur, Rangpur for partition and for recovery of khas possession in respect of the portion of the suit land.<br/><br/>3. The plaint case is that the land measuring 2.27 acres comprising Khatian  No. 479(Hal) belonged to Badia Sheikh  and after his demise the said land devolved upon his heirs, namely one son Bhola Sheikh, two daughters Pagli Ghai, Rahimun Nessa and one wife Nasiran, Nasiran Bewa died leaving one son Bhola Sheikh and two daughters. Bhola Sheikh got eight annas of the entire land i.e. 13½ acres and two daughters got to the extent of 0.56¾  acre each and they possessed their land. Bhola Sheikh transferred .90 acres form his share by deed dated 21.12.1953 to the plaintiff and Rahimun Nessa, he also transferred 0.23½ acres by registered deed dated 25.11.1954 to the plaintiff and the said Rahimun Nessa. Thus the plaintiff got .56¾ acres and Rahimun Nessa by purchase acquired .56¾ acres and by inheritance from her father 0.56¾ acres and her share stood at 1.13 ½ acres. After her death the defendant Nos.1-4 being her hairs got their respective share in the said land, while possessing the defendant No.2 transferred .33 acres to one Kerasuddin by an agreement, but Kerasuddin refused to purchase the said land and ultimately the land measuring .23½  acres was purchased by the plaintiff  by registered deed dated 12.01.1968. In the amended plaint the plaintiff claimed that their predecessor by registered deed dated 29.12.1953 purchased .23½ decimals from plot No.1609, .09 ½ decimals out of 19 decimals from plot No.1611, .12 decimals out of .24 decimals from plot No.1624 and in total .45 decimals and by registered deed dated 25.11.1954 purchased .11¾ out of .29 decimals in plot No. 1149 and also purchased .23 ½ decimals out of .47 decimals by registered deed dated 12.01.1968 in plot No. 1609 and total purchased land of the plaintiff is .80¼ decimals. The original plaintiff sold .09 decimals out of .47 decimals to the defendant Nos.16-18 and 21-25 and .22 decimals out of .29 decimals in plot No. 1149 to the defendant No.26 and deliv­ered possession of the said land.<br/><br/>4. The plaintiff retained 49¼ acres of land and had been possessing and enjoying the same. For convenience of peaceful pos­session the plaintiff requested the defen­dants for partition of the suit land on refusal on 31.01.1989 the plaintiff filed the said for partition claiming that the plaintiff possessed  .9½ acres  in plot No.1611, 0.38 acres in plot No.1609 and 0.01½ acres in plot No.1624, in total .49V2 acres, while possessing the said quantum of land in ejmali the defendant Nos.16-20 dispossessed the plaintiff from 0.11 acres of land out of .38 decimals from the west­ern side of plot No.1609 on 21.01.1996 forcibly where they made pucca construc­tion and (which fact was asserted in the amendment of the plaint after the remand) so the plaintiff also prayed for a decree for recovery of khas possession from that por­tion of the suit plot No.1609. In the unamended plaint the plaintiff prayed for sham of 0.58¾ decimals out of 89 ¾ dec­imals.<br/><br/>5. The defendant Nos.1-3, 16-18, 19-20 and 29 contested the suit by filing separate written statement. The case of the defen­dant Nos.1-3 is that defendant Nos.1-4 inherited the land to the extent of 1.13½ from Rahimun Nessa.  Defendant No.2 sold 0.24 acres on 06.08.1978 to Zahara Khatun and Zahura Khatun in turn sold the said land on 19.10.1978 to Sarwar Hossain. Paglimai the mother of defen­dant No.5 by Hiba deed dated 26.01.1981 transferred .23¾ acres to Servan Nessa, the wife of defendant No.2. The defendant No.2 had no saleable interest as mentioned in the plaint and the deed dated 12.01.1968 in respect 0.33 acres of land is fabricated. The case of the defendant Nos.16-18 is that the heirs of Badia Sheikh got their respective shares in the land according to the law of inheritance. After the death of Rahimun Nessa the defendant Nos.1-4 became the owners of Rahimun Nessa's share and they made partition ami­cably and the defendant Nos.1-3 got half of the land of C.S. Plot No.1609. Asimuddin the defendant No.3 sold out 0.06 acres and 0.09 acres from plot No. 1609 to the defendant Nos. 16-18 on 10.12.1983 and 22.06.1982 respectively by registered deed and subsequently the defendant Nos.16-18 purchased 0.03 acres of land from the plaintiff from plot No.1609 which was purchased by the plaintiff from Bhula Sheikh and accord­ingly the said defendants acquired title and interest to the extent of 0.10 acres of plot No.1609 and they have been enjoying the land for about 9 years. The plaintiffs sold out their land to different persons and they cannot claim land measuring 0.58 1/2 decimals in the suit plots.<br/><br/>6. The defendant Nos.19-20 asserted in the written statement that the plaintiff did not purchase 0.33 acres of land from Tajimuddin by any valid deed and they never got possession of the said land. They sold out their land to various per­sons. Defendant No.29 claimed that the heirs of Rahimun Nessa the defendant Nos.1-4 inherited their mother's share. Defendant No.4 Nurjahan got 0.7 1/5 acres by way of amicable partition and she while in possession ejmali transferred 0.03 1/2 acres out of plot No. 1609, 0.02 ½ acres of plot No.1612 by registered deed dated 17.01.1983 to the defendant No. 29 and the said defendant has been in physi­cal possession of the said land.<br/><br/>7. The trial court initially dismissed the suit and on appeal by the plaintiff the judgment of the trial court was set aside and the suit was sent back on remand for retrial after amendment of the plaint with prayer for khas possession in respect of 11 decimals of land of plot No. 1609 from which the plaintiff was dispossessed and after such  amendment the trial  court decreed the suit with a finding that the plaintiff has been in possession of 0.38¼ acres and awarded decree for khas posses­sion of 0.11 acres of plot No.1609 without determining the possession of the plaintiff in that portion of the said land, disposses­sion by the defendant Nos. 16-20 by judg­ment and decree dated 29.03.1998. The learned Subordinate Judge found that no specific saham was awarded to the plain­tiff in the decree passed by the trial court.<br/><br/>8. Against the said decree of the trial court the defendants preferred an appeal being other appeal No.77 of 1998 before the learned District Judge which was heard and    disposed of by the learned Subordinate Judge, 3rd Court, Rangpur and the learned Subordinate Judge on con­sideration of the pleadings of the parties and evidence on record allowed the appeal and set aside the decree of the trial court by judgment and decree dated 10.09.2000.<br/><br/>9. Against the judgment and decree dated 10.09.2000 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, the respondent being the petitioners filed Civil Revision No.1360 of 2001 and the High Court Division in absence of the learned Advocate for the defendant opposite par­ties and after hearing petitioner, the pres­ent respondents, made the rule absolute and set aside the judgment and decree of the appellate court with the remark that the plaintiffs possession was proved by P.Ws. and the date of possession was also proved by P.W.2 and P.w.3 without notic­ing one important aspect of the case that the defendant had been in possession of the land of plot No. 1609 which is admitted by the plaintiff and without considering the findings arrived by the final court of fact on the said issue causing serious mis­carriage of justice.<br/><br/>10. Against the judgment and order of the High Court Division dated 28.05.2007 the defendant petitioners preferred civil peti­tion for leave to appeal No. 1642 of 2007 and the leave petition was dismissed on 29.05.2008.<br/><br/>11. As against the judgment and order of this Court passed in the leave petition the petitioners have filed this review petition for leave to appeal.<br/><br/>12. Heard Md. Awlad Ali, learned Counsel appearing for petitioners and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/><br/>13. It appears that the petitioner did not raise the points now raised before us by way of review before the High Court Division and no case has been made out for review of the judgment passed by this Court.<br/>We find no merit in this review peti­tion which is accordingly dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
