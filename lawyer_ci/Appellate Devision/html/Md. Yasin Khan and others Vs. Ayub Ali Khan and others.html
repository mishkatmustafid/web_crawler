The facts of the case, in short, are that the plaintiff filed Title Suit No. 39 of 1991 in the 1st Court of Assistant Judge, Barisal claiming inheritance from Achimunnessa through her daughter Elimunnessa and it was asserted that Achimunnessa died leav­ing behind her only daughter Elimunnessa who inherited her entire property duly and correctly recorded during R.S. and S.A.Khatian in the name of Achimunnessa and the plaintiff laid further claim by inheri­tance from Money Ali Khan, predecessor of the appellant to the extent of 36 acres from S.A. Khatian Nos.377, 378, 288 and 300 and by purchase from the defendant No.1, Abdul Kader Khan being their heir of recorded tenant Golam Habib by exhib­it-1 to the extent of 34 acres from State Acquisition Khatian Nos. 9 and 282.<br/><br/>3. The defendant Nos. 1, 6-11 contested the suit by filing written statement con­tending, inter alia, that the suit property originally belonged to Neyamutullah and he was succeeded by his three sons kefayet Khan, Mai Khan and Salamat Khan and it was further alleged that Salamat Khan was succeeded by his son, Ibrahim Khan. Ibrahim Khan died leaving two daughters including Achimunnessa, mother Safar Jan. Achimunnessa inherited the entire interest of her sister and mother after their death and the defendants claimed to be successive heir of Kefayet Khan and Mai Kahan and claimed their interest in the property of Achimunnessa as distant kindred to the extent to 8 annas.<br/><br/>4. Leave was granted to consider the sub­mission of the learned Advocate for the appellants that "Because the High Court Division has erred in modifying the decree passed on concurrent findings of fact upon reassessing evidence although there was no case of non-consideration of evidence."<br/><br/>5.  Mr. S. M. Munir, learned Advocate, appearing for the appellants submitted that the High Court Division has erred in mod­ifying the decree passed on concurrent findings of fact upon reassessing evidence although there was no case of non-consid­eration of evidence. The learned Advocate further submitted that the defendants who entered into a compromise, disclaiming as district kindred their claims are barred by estoppel. The learned Advocate finally submitted that the High Court Division committed error of law by holding that the claim of inheritance made by the defen­dant has been admitted by not denying the case of the defendant.<br/><br/>6. Mr. Mihirkanti Majumder,learned Advocate, appearing for the respondent submitted that the High Court Division has acted within its jurisdiction in modify­ing the decree of the Courts below based on misreading of pleadings and non-con­sideration of evidence on the issue as to proof of their status as agnatic relations to Achimunnessa; that the defendant-respon­dent's claim of inheritance comes within serial 19 of the table of residuary share according to Muslim Law of Inheritance by Mullah; that the respondents claim of being agnatic relations is very much determinable on the  available evidence on record. The learned Advocate finally sub­mitted that respondents claim of being agnatic relations is very much determinable on the available evidence on record.<br/><br/>7. It appears from the R.S. and S. A Khatians the names of predecessor of defendant Nos. 1-4 including the name of defendant No. 1 appear as co-sharers with Achimunnessa. It appears from the cir­cumstances that the defendants could not prove that they are not the heirs and suc­cessive heirs of Achimunnessa so as to inherit the interest of the suit land proper­ty on her death. The defendants are in fact and in law inherited the land of suit prop­erties from Achimunnessa as their prede­cessors come within serial No. 19 of table of residuary in order of succession as male descendants of more remote true grandfa­ther. It appears that the Court below did not at consider the claim of the defendants and as such, committed an error of law in decreeing the suit of the plaintiffs to the exclusion of the defendants who are the heirs and successive heirs of Achimunnessa.<br/><br/>8. The High Court Division considered the facts and circumstances and the evidence on record and the law involved on the sub­ject and held that the learned Courts below committed an error of law in decreeing the suit of the plaintiff with respect to 16 annas share of the land of Achimunnessa to the exclusion of the share of the defendants. Accordingly, by the impugned the judgment and decree decreed-in-part in favour of the plaintiff in respect of the share of 2.05 acres of land out of land of the suit properties for which they would get separate saham.<br/><br/>9. The Courts below have decreed the suit allotting saham to the plaintiffs to the extent of 3.481/2 acres of land but the High Court Division on consideration of evidence and materials on record have modified the saham and allowed the plain­tiffs a decree for separate saham in respect of 2.05 acres of land instead of 3.481/2 acres of land holding that the defendants  are the heir and successive heirs of Kifayet Khan, Mal Khan and Mobe Khan who were none but full brothers of Salamat Khan, the paternal grandfather of Achimunnessa as evidenced by records including R.S and S.A Khatians where the names of the predecessors of defendant Nos. 1-14 appears as co-sharers with Achimunnessa. Accordingly, the defen­dants could not prove that they are not the heirs or successive heirs of Achimunnessa so as to inherit the interest of the land of the suit property on her death being the residuaries in order of succession as male descendants of more remote true grandfa­ther. Accordingly, on calculation of the shares of the defendant in the suit land High Court Division accordingly decreed the suit. We have perused the said calcula­tion and the appellant could not show any mistake or otherwise any defect in the said allotment of shares in allowing a separate saham in respect of 2.05 acres of land in favour of the plaintiffs instead of 3.481/2 acres of land as decreed by the Courts below allotting 16 annas share in suit land in favour of the plaintiff to the exclusion of shares of defendants.<br/>10. In view of the above, we found no merit in the submissions of the learned Advocate for the appellants.<br/>Accordingly, the appeal in dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
