Ruhul Amin J. -</strong> The petitioner seeks review of the judgment dated December 14, 2003 passed in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 2071 of 2001. The civil petition for leave to appeal was filed against the judgment dated August 16, 2001 passed in Writ Petition No. 3419 of 2001. By the said judgment the High Court Division rejected the writ petition summarily upon awarding cost of Tk. 5,00,000/- to be paid by the Inspector General of Police i.e. the petitioner who was Inspector General of Police at the relevant time.<br/><br/>2. The Writ Petition No.3419 of 2001 was filed by one Iqbal Anwar impugning the letter dated July 17, 2000 written by the ministry of Home Affairs directing the Police Commissioner, Metropolitan Police, Dhaka to handover possession of the building in Plot No. C.W.N. (B3), Road No.115, holding No.124, Gulshan Avenue (hereinafter the property) wherein the Gulshan Police Station was at that time located to one Nazrul Islam, attorney of Mr.Khurshid Anwar to whom the property belongs. It may be mentioned the property was treated as abandoned property and thereupon allotted to the Ministry of Home Affairs for housing Gulshan Police Station. The claimant of the property sought for release of the property from the list of abandoned buildings by filing case before the Court of Settlement and the same was allowed. The judgment of the Court of Settlement was not challenged by the abandoned property authority. Since possession of the property was not handed over to the claimant, he filed the writ Petition No.3093 of 2000 seeking direction to the authority for handing over possession of the property.<br/><br/>3. The Rule obtained in the said writ petition was made absolute on October 26, 2000 and the authority i.e. Ministry of Home Affairs and the Inspector General of Police and others were directed to handover possession of the property to Nazrul Islam, the attorney of Mr. Khurshid Anwar, the claimant of the property.<br/><br/>4. The Ministry of Home Affairs directed the Inspector General of Police to handover possession of the property to the claimant. But instead of doing that it transpires from the materials on record that the Inspector General of Police and others were out to retain possession of the property upon resorting to several litigations figuring as the 1st party in some of the litigations and in some cases by setting up or through the set up person who figured as the 1 st party in the same and in one of such litigations one of such set up persons was one Iqbal Anwar who claimed himself to be the son of Khurshid Anwar. He filed Writ Petition No.3419 of 2000 as stated hereinbefore impugning the letter dated July 17, 2001 of the Ministry of Home Affairs whereby Police Commissioner, Dhaka Metropolitan Police was directed to hand over possession of the property and that also prayed for a direction to the authority to vacate the property and to hand over possession thereof to the petitioner i.e. Iqbal Anwar.<br/><br/>5. If may be mentioned while the concerned authority was not taking action in the light of the judgment in Writ Petition No.3093 of 2000, the attorney of the claimant of the property filed Contempt Petition No.16 of 2000. While the petition came up for hearing, then the then Inspector General of Police i.e. the petitioner gave an undertaking to handover possession of the property and that would inform the Court by filing affidavit on 19.7.2001 about compliance of the Court's order regarding handing over possession of the property to the claimant. In the background of the undertaking given by the petitioner through his learned Advocate the hearing of the contempt petition was adjourned to August 2, 2001. From the materials on record it is seen that instead of handing over possession of the property to the claimant the petitioner filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 38 of 2001 and therein prayed for stay of the order dated 30.7.2001 but the same was not allowed by the order dated 2.8.2001 passed by the Judge in Chamber of the Division.<br/><br/>6. As stated hereinbefore the personnel of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police as well as the Inspector General of Police inspite of the instructions from the Ministry of Home Affairs to handover possession of the property to the claimant resorted to 3 civil suits through set up person as well as by them. Three writ petitions through the set up person as well as by the Police personnel, one First Miscellaneous Appeal, two petitions for leave to appeal before this Division and one Miscellaneous civil petition for leave to appeal.<br/><br/>7. In the background of the aforesaid facts the High Court Division rejected the Writ Petition No.3419 of 2001 summarily by the order dated August 16, 2001 upon awarding cost of Tk. 5,00,000/- to be paid by the Inspector General of Police to the attorney of the claimant of the property. It may be mentioned on August 10, 2001 the petitioner was very much the Inspector General of Police. The petitioner assumed the office of the Inspector General of Police on June 6, 2000 and was in the said office till the assumption of the office Inspector General of Police by the next Inspector General of Police on November 6, 2001. The Writ Petition No.3419 of 2001 was filed by Iqbal Anwar claiming himself as the son of Khurshid Anwar, the   claimant of the property and therein Inspector General of the Police along with others were in the category of Respondents. As stated hereinbefore that the Metropolitan police personnel and the Inspector General of Police in total disregard of the direction of the Ministry of Home Affairs did not make over possession of the   property to the claimant inspite of the fact that the Ministry of Public works allotted house in the Gulshan area for relocating the Gulshan Police Station from the property in question.<br/><br/>8. As against the order dated August 16, 2001 the petitioner filed Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 2071 of 2001. This Division while rejecting the said petition for leave to appeal in detail stated the facts starting from listing the property as abandoned property and thereupon releasing the property by the Court of Settlement and thereafter obtaining of direction from the High Court Division for compliance of the order passed in the judgment of the Court of Settlement upon de-listing the property from the list of abandoned buildings and the facts subsequent thereto, filing of several litigations, either by the metropolitan police or by set up person of the metropolitan police and the Inspector General of Police.<br/><br/>9. The learned Counsel for the petitioner has urged the following grounds in support of the petition seeking review of the judgment dated December 14, 2003 in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.2071 of 2001:<br/>"I. Because the leave petition was dismissed on the basis that "submissions of the learned Advocate-on-Record is totally misconceived since the writ petition was disposed of in presence of the petitioner" which is an error apparent on the face of the record and, as such the judgment should be reviewed for ends of justice.<br/>II. Because Writ Petition No. 3419 of 2001 was summarily rejected upon hearing Mr. Md. Moksudur Rahman on behalf of petitioner, Iqbal Anwar, "cost", if  at  all, could   have been awarded against the petitioner Iqbal Anwar and not against a respondent in the proceeding.<br/>III. Because High Court Division having awarded "compensation" to a third party (Nazrul Islam who is not a party in the writ petition) in the name of "cost" the same should not be sustained".<br/><br/>10. It has been submitted by the learned Counsel of the petitioner that since the Writ Petition No.3419 of 2001 was rejected summarily there was no occasion for awarding cost or compensation to the attorney of the claimant of the property who was not a party in the writ petition. In the background of the facts as noticed by the High Court Division and some of which have been stated above submission made is not well merited since it is the obligation and the duty of the Inspector General of Police i.e. the petitioner who was at the relevant time holding the office of Inspector General of Police to comply with the direction made by the Ministry of Home Affairs but instead of complying with the direction of the Ministry of Home Affairs the petitioner and other Police personnel subordinate to him resorted to civil litigations, both ordinary and extraordinary. The conduct demonstrated by the petitioner and others subordinate to him being not the reflection of the conduct of responsible government functionary, rather the same being total flouting of the order of the Court and also demonstration of disrespect to the order of the Court as well as to the superior authority, the High Court Division in our view was not in error in awarding cost to the petitioner since he was also instrumental in obstructing the compliance of the direction of the Court either through the person subordinate to him or through the person s.et up by him and others. It has been submitted by the learned Counsel for the petitioner that the High Court Division should not have allowed the intervener to present the case of the claimant of the property at the time of hearing of the Writ Petition No.3419 of 2000. The contention so made is also not well merited since the relief sought in the writ petition was in effect against the claimant of the property and that to deprive the claimant of the property having possession of the property in the light of the direction made in Writ Petition No.3093 of 2000 disposed of on October 26, 2000. In the background of the facts and circumstances of the case the High Court Division was not in error in hearing the intervener who placed the case of the claimant of the property which was very much necessary for adjudication of the Writ Petition No. 3419 of 2000 which was filed with the object of making ineffective the direction given by the High Court Division earlier in Writ Petition No. 3093 of 2000. As we have already observed that writ-petitioner of Writ Petition No. 3419 of 2000 was in fact a person set up by the Inspector General of Police and the personnel of the Metropolitan Police Commissioner in filing frivolous civil litigations as well as writ petition with the object of non-complying with the direction of the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 3093 of 2000 and that the civil litigations, both ordinary and extra-ordinary, were resorted to in fact to use the same as the garb with the object of flouting the direction of the Court to handover possession of the property to the claimant. In the aforestate of the matter although the petitioner figured as Respondent in Writ Petition No.3419 of 2000 but in fact it is he who was instrumental in filing the said writ petition and as such it can not be said that he was away from the Court and was quite unaware of the writ petition. The said being the position we are of the view High Court Division was not in error in awarding cost or compensation, whatever be the same, to be paid by the petitioner. The learned Counsel at the end of his submission urged that in case review petition does not receive favourable consideration of the Court in that case amount awarded as cost by the High Court Division may be reduced to a reasonable amount keeping in view the present position of the petitioner who is now a retired government official.<br/><br/>11. In the background of the facts of the case we are of the view that the submissions made on behalf of petitioner are not well merited.<br/><br/>12. Before parting with matter we like to observe that of late  tendency  of serious nature which in no way conducive to good governance, is noticed in the conduct, behaviour as well attitude of the functionaries, highly placed and responsible and the persons subordinate to them, of the government and other governmental agencies/ organizations in resorting to the contrive either to avoid compliance with/ implementation of the order/direction of the Court including Supreme Court or to create a situation with shady logic lacking genuineness to frustrate the intent and purpose of the order of the Court or to harass the party as well as to delay the implementation of the order of the Court. Substantial numbers of government functionaries are quite unmindful of the provision of the Article 112 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh which require them to act in aid of the Supreme Court. Time is high to see by the concerned that government functionaries as well as the personnel of other organizations under the supervision of the Government act within the bounds of the discipline and norms of their service and while dealing with the order of the superior Court keep in mind provision of Article 112 of the Constitution.<br/><br/>Accordingly the review petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
