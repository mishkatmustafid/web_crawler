Tafazzul Islam J. -</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 09.05.2007 of the High Court Division passed in Writ Petition No. 2075 of 2003 discharging the Rule which was obtained challeng­ing the judgment an order dated 14.01.2003 of the First Court of Settlement, Dhaka, passed in case No. 168 of 2001 rejecting the prayer of the petitioner for release of House No. Ka-119, Pallabi, Mirpur, Dhaka from Ka List of the Abandoned Buildings.<br/><br/>2. Fact, in brief, are that the petitioner files the above Case No.168 of 2001 for release of the above house from the Ka List stating that initially she had been in possession thereof on the strength of a written agreement for sale dated 19.06.1970 with Abdul Hamid Khan Qamar who purchased the said property from Messrs Eastern Housing Limited by a registered deed of sale dated 25.08.1966, and in term of the above agreement she paid the full considera­tion money of TK.5,000.00 which the vendor received but the consideration money was subsequently re-fixed at TK.10,000.00 under a fresh agreement dated 04.05.1980 by which she was required to pay a further sum of Tk.6,000.00 as earnest money irrespec­tive of what she had paid under the ear­lier agreement dated 19.06.1970 and that ultimately she had to institute Title Suit No. 560 of 1981 in the First Court of Munsif (now Assistant Judge), Dhaka for specific performance of contract but at the intervention of well wishers, the parties compromised the said suit out of Court and accordingly both the parties filed an application in the Court on 04.08.1983  for compromise but as ill luck would have it, the vendor Abdul Hamid Khan Qamar died on 26.08.1983 and he was buried at Government Mirpur Graveyard and thereafter Jobeda Khatun and Abdul Jabbar Khan, respec­tively the daughter and son of late Abdul Hamid Khan Omar, again enhancing the price of the house at Tk.20,000.00, exe­cuted and registered the sale deed dated 29.08.1984 transferring their right, title and interest in the case house in favour of the petitioner and since then she, on mutating her name in Mutation Case No. 22643/95-96, had been in peaceful possession of the above house without any objection from the Government or anybody else and she had also been paying rent and municipal taxes etc but without serving any notice upon the petitioner, the above house was illegally enlisted in Ka List. The Government did not file any written objection before the Court of Settlement controverting the claim of the petitioner.<br/><br/>3. The Court of Settlement, after hear­ing, dismissing the case. As against that the petitioner filed Writ Petition No.2075 of 2000 and after hearing, the High Court Division discharged the Rule.<br/><br/>4. We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, and perused the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/><br/>5.  As it appears the High Court Division discharged the Rule holding that the records show that the  property was declared as an abandoned property and was enlisted in the Ka List and the gov­ernment took control management and supervision of the above house through allottee Wahiduzzaman, a demand note holder, who was residing in the house as an allottee since 1975 and he was regu­larly paying rent and taxes through chalan; although an agreement was entered into between the petitioner and the orig­inal owner on 19.06.1970 the same was not acted upon an then a fresh agree­ment for sale was entered into between the parties on 04.05.1980 and a sale deed was executed and registered in favour of the petitioner on 29.08.1984 but the agreement for sale being entered into on 04.05.1980, that is after the 25th day of March 1971, the same has no legal effect in the eye of law; it is also evident from the contents of the writ petition that the petitioner filed Title Suit No. 560 of 1981 against the owner of the property for specific performance of contract after he failed to execute and register the sale deed and a compromise petition was filed in the said suit and before giving effect to it, the original owner died on 32.06.1983 and thereafter is heirs executed the sale deed in favour of the petitioner; but section 6 of Ordinance No. 54 of 1985 provides that no suit or other legal proceedings shall lie before any Court for specific per­formance of contract in respect of any building the possession of which has been taken by the Government as aban­doned property under the Presidents Order No. 10 of 1972 and in the present case the property in question was admit­tedly declared as an abandoned property and was enlisted in the Ka List of the Abandoned Buildings and subsequent to that, an agreement for sale was entered into between the parties and so the above suit for specific performance of contract was filed by the petitioner in clear violation of section 6 of Ordinance No. 54 of 1985; further the contents of the judgment and order passed by the Court of Settlement shows that the peti­tioner failed to produce certain docu­ments like the certified copy of the com­promise, the order dated 22.08.1983 passed in Title Suit No. 560 of 1981 and moreover the Court of Settlement also found that the signatures of the heirs of the original owner, that is the vendor of the petitioner, were absent in the first 8 pages of the sale deed and there some other anomalies in the signature of the parties and taking into consideration the evidence, both oral and documentary, the Court of Settlement held that the house in Buildings and in such cases, the onus in on the claimant of the property to prove that the property is not an abandoned property and the Government has no obligation either to deny the facts as alleged by the claimant or to disclose the basis of treating the property as abandoned property merely because the claimant disputes the same and moreover the High Court Division in exercise of its writ jurisdiction can not sit as a Court of Appeal over the judgment of the Court of Settlement for resettling the question of fact.<br/><br/>6. We are of the view that the High Court Division on proper consideration of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision and there is no illegali­ty or infirmity in the above decision so as to call for any interference.<br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
