Joynul Abedin J. - </strong>This appeal by  leave by the defendants is directed against the judgment and order dated 24.6.1999  passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 1482 of 1996 making the rule absolute and thereby reversing the judgment and decree dated 29.07.1987 passed by Subordinate Judge, Shariatpur in Title Appeal No.160 of 1986 allowing the appeal and there by setting aside the judgment and decree dated 17.07.1986 passed by the Munsif, Shariatpur in Title Suit No. 341 of 1982 decreeing the suit.               <br/><br/>2. The respondent Nos.1-4 and their predecessor-in-interest as plaintiff filed Title Suit No. 341 of 1982 in the Court of Munsif, Shariatpur for declaration of title and confirmation of possession in the suit land. The case of the plaintiffs is that the suit land originally belonged to one Kurban Ali Matbar and in successive devolution, the suit land devolved upon Serajuddin Matbar by way of inheritance and he died leaving behind the plaintiff-respondent as his sole heir. The plaintiff-respondents possessed the suit land in assertion of their right in it. But as the suit land was wrongly recorded in the name of the defendant- petitioners and they tried to dispossess the plaintiffs, the plaintiff-respondents filed the suit.<br/><br/>3. The defendant-petitioners contested the suit alleging that the suit land belonged to Kurban Ali who took loan from Karam Ali Sheikh but the loan remained unpaid. Kurban Ali died without payment of loan. Hence Karam Sheikh filed money suit and obtained an <em>ex parte</em> decree against the heirs of Kurban Ali on 8.1.1923. On 23.9.1923 in execution of the said decree the land was auction-sold and the decree holder Karam Sheikh purchased the same and on 7.1.1924 got the sale certificate and in the last part of November 1924 the auction-purchaser Karam Sheikh got pos­session of the suit land and thereafter sold out some land purchased in the auction-sale to different persons at different times. The defendant-petitioners assert that they also purchased the suit land from Karam Sheikh and his heirs after his death and they are owners in possession of the suit land.<br/><br/>4. The learned Munsif decreed the suit on contest. On appeal by the defendant-petitioners the appellate court below dis­missed the suit on the finding that the land of the suit Khatian being C.S. Khatian No. 26 was auction-sold and Karam Sheikh purchased the same and defendant Nos. 5-10 as well as the heirs of Karam Sheikh purchased the suit land from him and also from his subsequent purchasers.<br/><br/>5. The plaintiff-respondents thereafter moved the High Court Division in revi­sion and obtained rule. Subsequently the High Court Division made the rule absolute concurring with the finding of the learned Munsif that the defendants pro­duced no documentary or oral evidence in respect of the money decree dated 8.1.1923 obtained in the money suit filed by Karam Sheikh and that there as an auc­tion-sale of the land of the suit Khatian pursuant to the said decree and Karam Sheikh purchased the land of the suit Khatian in auction and dismissed the suit on the ground that the defendants' claim of title and possession in the suit land was not proved. The High Court Division also held that the court of appeal below dis­missed the suit as not maintainable with­out discussing the evidence and thus made the rule absolute.<br/><br/>6. Leave was granted to consider whether the High Court Division erred in failing to hold that Karam Ali Sheikh purchased the suit land in auction in Money Execution Case No.183 of 1923 and sale certificate was issued on 7.1.1924 which was marked as exhibit and he subsequently obtained possession of the suit land through court. Whether the High court Division also erred in dismissing the suit in failing to consider. Exhibits D, E, F, H, I, J, K and L which point to the fact that the suit C.S. Khatian was sold in auction and was pur­chased by Karam Ali Sheikh which was subsequently purchased by the defendants and the heirs of original C.S. recorded ten­ant Kurban Ali although this was duly considered and discussed by the court of appeal below.<br/><br/>7. We have heard Salam Khan, the learned Advocate for the appellants and Farid Ahmed, the learned Advocate for respondent Nos.1-6 and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/><br/>8. Salam Khan, the learned Advocate for the appellant supports the findings of the appellate court below and the reason­ings assigned in favour of such findings and submits that the High Court Division came to a wrong finding as to title and possession of the suit land in favour of the plaintiffs which is not supported by the evidence and materials on record occa­sioning failure of justice.<br/><br/>9. Farid Ahmed on the other hand sup­ports the impugned judgment passed by the High Court Division submitting that the plaintiffs succeeded in proving their title and possession in the suit on the basis of inheritance as heirs of Kurban Ali.<br/><br/>10. It is noted on careful perusal and exam­ination of the materials on record that the land of the suit Khatian was sold in auc­tion in the aforesaid money execution case arising out of the said money suit filed by Karam Sheikh against the heirs of Kurban Ali and Karam Sheikh auction-purchased the land of the suit Khatian and the defen­dants purchased the suit land from Karam Shikh as well as his heirs. Karam Sheikh also sold some land of the suit Khatian to the plaintiffs who are heirs of Kurban Ali, the original owner of the land of the suit Khatian. The defendants proved the sale certificate which was marked as exhibit in the suit. The defendants have also suc­ceeded in proving the sale of the land of the suit Khatian to the defendants, plain­tiffs as heirs of Kurban Ali and also to oth­ers by proving the sale deeds and other documents including the rent receipts showing possession of the defendants in the suit land <em>vide</em> Exhts. D, E, F, H, I, J, K and L. Despite such proof the trial Court as well as the High Court Division decreed the suit by finding title and possession of the suit land in favour of the plaintiffs without considering the aforesaid exhibits. As a result there has been a miscarriage of justice.<br/><br/>11. There is yet another important aspect of the case not considered by the trial Court as well as the High Court Division. The evidence of PWs.1 and 2 shows that the plaintiffs were dispossessed from the suit land by the defendants during penden­cy of the suit. Despite such a state of fact obtaining in the present case the plaintiffs did not amend the plaint incorporating prayer for recovery of khas possession deleting the original prayer for confirma­tion of possession. But the trial as well as the High Court Division decreed the suit although the plaintiffs were admittedly dispossessed by the defendants during the pendency of the suit and no prayer for recovery of possession was made by the plaintiffs. The impugned judgment thus suffers legal infirmity and is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>The appeal is therefore allowed with­out any order as to costs.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
