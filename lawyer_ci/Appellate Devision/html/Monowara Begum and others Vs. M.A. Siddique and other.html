Short facts are that the plaintiffs insti­tuted title Suit No. 86 of 1992 in the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Savar, Dhaka for declaration of title, recovery of khas possession and for cancellation of deeds of schedule of the plaint stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit land comprising 36 decimals belonged to the defendant No. 12 who entered into an agreement with the plain­tiff No.1 to sell the suit land on 8.1.1987 at a consideration of Tk. 60,000/- and a sum of Tk.5,000/- was paid by the plaintiffs as earnest money and subsequently Tk. 44,060/- was paid out of balance con­sideration money and after receiving the said amount, the son of the defendant No. 12 on her behalf signed the written agree­ment and thereafter the plaintiffs paid Tk. 11,000/- to the defendant No.12 on 1.6.1989 as balance consideration money. Thereafter two deeds were written and both the deeds were executed by the defendant No. 12 on 1.6.1969 and it was decided that the deeds would be registered on commission. Subsequently the defen­dant No.12 failed to admit execution of the sale deeds for which the plaintiffs were compelled to file Title Suit No. 71 of 1990 and Title Suit No. 72 of 1992 in the Court of Assistant Judge, Savar, Dhaka and obtained <em>ex-parte</em> decree and got the deeds registered through Court. The plaintiffs were in possession. On 10.7.1989 the plaintiffs came to know of the kabala in the name of the defendant Nos. 1-8 regarding the suit land which were execut­ed by the defendant No. 12 and defendant Nos. 1-8 were collusive and inoperative and not binding upon the plaintiffs. So the plaintiffs filed the present suit for declara­tion title, recovery of khas possession and cancellation of the deeds.<br/><br/>3. The defendant Nos.1-10 contested the suit by filing written statements denying the material allegations made in the plaint.<br/><br/>4. The case of the defendants are that the defendant No. 12 was the owner of the suit land sold it to the defendant Nos. 1-8 by kabala dated 10.7.1989 and handed over possession of the suit land and subse­quently the defendant No.5 sold 5 deci­mals of land to the defendant No.9 on 9.12.1989 and the defendant Nos. 5 again sold 5 decimals of land to Abdus Sattar by a kabala on 8.12.1989 and they have been possessing of the suit land. The defendant No. 12 did not sell the suit land to the plaintiffs and the kabalas produced by the plaintiffs are forged, false, fabricated, inoperative and not binding upon the defendants. The plaintiffs never possessed the suit land.<br/><br/>5. The defendant No.12 contested the suit by filing a separate written statement contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that she never sold the suit land to the plaintiffs nor she executed any deed in favour of the plaintiffs. She never handed over possession to them and she only sold the suit land to the defendant Nos. 1-8 by execution of kabala deeds and handed over possession to them.<br/><br/>6. The trial Court dismissed the suit. On appeal being Title Appeal No. 804 of 1999 the appellate Court allowed the appeal and decreed the suit.  Being aggrieved, the defendants    moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained Rule which after hearing was discharged as noticed earlier.<br/><br/>7. We have heard Mr. A.K.M. Nazrul Islam, the learned Counsel for the peti­tioners and perused the impugned judg­ment.<br/><br/>8. This Division while disposing of the leave petition had taken into consideration the fact that the document in favour of the plaintiffs are earlier in point of time than the documents in favour of the defendants and both the documents were executed by the same vendor, i.e., the defendant No. 12 and the defendant No. 12 also earlier exe­cuted an agreement for sale in favour of the plaintiffs.<br/><br/>9. We have also noticed that the Court of appeal compared the signatures of the exe­cutant i.e. the defendant No.12 in the bainapatra dated 8.1.1987 Ext. X with her admitted signatures in the subsequent deeds executed in favour of the defendants Exts. Kha (1) to Kha (7) and found the sig­natures similar and accordingly, the peti­tion was dismissed.<br/><br/>A review petition is not rehearing of the matter. There is no cogent ground for review of the impugned judgment.<br/>The review petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
