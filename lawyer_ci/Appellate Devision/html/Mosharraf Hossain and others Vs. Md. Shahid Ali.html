Ruhul Amin J. -</strong> This petition for leave to appeal has been filed against the order dated January 17, 2004 of a Single Bench of the High Court Division reject­ing the application seeking review of the judgment dated May 5, 2003 in Civil Revision No. 8766 of 1991 making the Rule absolute upon setting aside the judg­ment and order dated March 11, 1989 of the Court of Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge) Nawabganj in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 11 of 1984 whereby judgment and order dated January 15, 1984 of the Court of Munsif (now Assistant Judge), Nawabganj in Miscellaneous Case No. 84 of 1980 was set aside. The trial Court by the aforesaid judgment allowed the prayer for pre-emp­tion sought under section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950. Pre­-emption was sought claiming to be a con­tiguous land owner. It appears from the judgment of the High Court Division sought to be appealed that the civil revi­sion was heard in the absence of the opposite party since no one appeared to oppose the Rule.<br/><br/>2. The trial Court allowed the prayer for pre-emption on the finding that the pre-emptor is the contiguous land holder to the land sought to be pre-empted and that the Miscellaneous case is not barred by limi­tation and also not bad for defect of party. On appeal by the pre-emptee the appellate Court set aside the judgment of the trial Court on the view that the subject matter of the suit being a pond and as such being non-agricultural land pre-emption sought under section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act was not tenable in law and that the pre-emptor was required to seek pre-emption under section 24 of the Non-agricultural Tenancy Act and that as under section 24 of the Non-agricultural Tenancy Act contiguous land holder has no right to seek pre-emption, the pre-emp­tion sought was not available to the pre-emptor and as such trial Court was in error in allowing the prayer for pre-emption.<br/><br/>3. The High Court Division set aside the judgment of the lower appellate Court on the view that the said Court was in error in holding that pond being non-agricultural land the petition filed under section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act is not maintainable since water of the pond in the background of the purpose for which the same is used the pond in ques­tion is agricultural land and consequently pre-emption sought for was very much available under section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act.<br/><br/>4. As the Rule was heard in the absence of the pre-emptee opposite party, he filed an application seeking review of the judg­ment taking the ground that the opposite party No.4 in the revisional application who was a co-sharer transferred his inter­est on 13.3.1976 before he made exchange of the earlier sold land with the pre-emp-tor on March 15, 1980 and as such pre-emptor had no occasion to claim co-sharership in the holding since pre-emptee purchased the land from the person to whom  Opposite  party No.4 sold  no 13.3.1976 and thereby acquired co-sharership in the holding and as such pre-emp-tor as contiguous land holder was not enti­tled to claim pre-emption he also being a co-sharer in the holding. The other point raised in support of the review application was that kabala of March 13, 1976 was challenged in Other Class Suit No. 470 of 1996 and in the said suit a compromise petition was filed by the parties agreeing that kabala of March 13, 1976 shall pre­vail.<br/><br/>5. The prayer for review was opposed con­tending that no ground for review has been made out in the light of the provision of Order 47, rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure and that the points raised in support of the prayer for review was dis­cussed and disposed of by the High Court Division on May 5, 2003. It has also been contended that pre-emptee became co-sharer in the holding prior to the date of accrual of right of pre-emption.<br/><br/>6. The High Court Division rejected the prayer for pre-emption on the finding that no ground for review was made out.<br/><br/>7. We have heard the learned Advocate-on-record and perused the materials on record. The learned Advocate-on-record from the materials on record failed to show that any ground for review was made out before the High Court Division. It is seen from the judgment of the High Court Division that the ground contended in support of the application for review in fact was an endeavor to hear the civil revi­sion afresh. Since no ground for review could be made out before the High Court Division we are of the view said Division committed no error in rejecting the appli­cation seeking review of the judgment dated May 5, 2003. As has already been stated hereinbefore that from our perusal of the materials on record we find that Petitioner herein failed to make out any case of review of the judgment of the High Court Division dated May 5, 2003.<br/><br/>8.  In the background of the discussions made herein above we find no substance in the petition.<br/><br/>Accordingly the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
