Leave was granted to consider that the learned single Judge of the High Court Division erred in not considering that the suit barred by <em>res judicata</em> or not is a matter to be decided at the time of trial by framing an issue and same could not be decided from a mere reading of the plaint.<br/><br/>3. Material facts necessary for disposal of the point raised briefly are that the appellant as the plaintiff instituted the aforesaid Title Suit No. 98 of 1993 in the Court of Assistant Judge, Chandpur for a declaration that the judgment and decree passed in Title Appeal No. 127 of 1988 in respect of the property mentioned in 'kha' schedule under the schedule 'ka of the plaint is null and void and not binding upon him. Her case was that the suit property origi­nally belonged to Ali Amjad and Syed Ali who transferred 16 acre of land in Plot No. 546 to Bakhar Ali Molla husband of the plaintiff and predecessor of others who sold the same to one Abdul Karim Miajee by a registered deed of sale on 7th July, 1948 that subsequently the said Abdul Karim Miajee by registered deed of sale dated 3rd November , 1951 re-transferred the suit land to aforesaid late Bakhar Ali Molla, Abdul Jabbar Molla, Jafor Ali Molla, that Abdul Jabbar Molla purchased the share of Jafar Ali Molla by a registered deed of sale on 11th November, 1955. Subsequently, Abdul Jabbar Molla transferred .8 acre of land to the plaintiff. The plaintiff's further case was that her husband Bakhar Ali Molla never transferred the suit land to any body but defendant No. 1 created a false deed of agreement on 18th August, 1978 for sale of the suit property and then he filed title Suit No. 516 of 1979 against his husband for Specific Performance of Contract and obtained a decree on 17 May, 1992. Hence the suit.<br/><br/>4. The defendant respondent No. 1 contest­ed the said filing written statement and denied the material averments made in the plaint. His case was that Late Bakhar Ali Mollah (husband of the plaintiff appellant) entered into contract with him (defendant respondent No. 1) for sale of the suit property for a consideration of Tk. 8000/- and said Bakhar Ali Mollah received Tk. 7500/- as advance but when said Bakar Mollah refused to execute a deed then the said defen­dant respondent No. 1 had to file Title Suit No. 516 of 1979; that it was further alleged that dur­ing the pendency of the said suit the said Bakhar Ali Mollah died and accordingly his wife (plaintiff) of the subsequent Title Suit No. 98 of 1993 was duly substituted along with other heirs. However, the said suit of the respondent No. 1 was dismissed and against which the said respondent No. 1 preferred Title Appeal No. 127 of 1988 and the leaned Sub­ordinate Judge upon hearing the parties allowed the same and there by decreed the suit.<br/><br/>5. The plaintiff (appellant herein) being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment of reversal moved the High Court Division and the Rule issued in Civil Revision No. 2301 of 1992 was discharged by the learned judge of the High Court Division on 4.8.1992.<br/><br/>6. Thereafter the decree holder defendant respondent No. 1 started Title Execution Case No. 10 of 1992 and in execution of the same the kabala was executed on 1st December, 1992 and registered on 2 December 1992 through court.<br/><br/>7. While the plaintiff's aforesaid Title Suit No. 98 of 1993 was in progress the defendant respondent No. 1 filed an application on 13.2.1993 under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure for rejection of the plaint and the learned Assistant Judge after hearing the parties rejected the same by his order dated 19th May, 1993.<br/><br/>8. Against the aforesaid order of rejection, the defendant respondent No. 1 moved the High Court Division in revision and the learned Judge of the High Court Division on 7.7.1993 summarily rejected the revision application under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure filed by the defendant respondent No. 1 that against the aforesaid order of rejec­tion of the plaint the defendant respondent No. 1 did not move before the higher forum. But sub­sequently the said defendant respondent No. 1 filed another application on 7.7.1993 under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the learned Assistant Judge rejected the same on 7.7.1993 and against which the respon­dent moved the High Court Division and the Rule issued therein in Civil Revision No. 3152 of 1993 and the High Court Division by judg­ment and order dated 2.2.1995 set aside the judgment of the learned Assistant Judge hold­ing that the plaintiff's suit was hit by principle of <em>res judicata</em> as the subject matter of the plain­tiff's suit was directly and substantially was issue in the earlier suit for Specific Performance of Contract being Suit No. 516 of 1979 filed the defendant respondent No. 1.<br/><br/>9. Mr. Khandker Mahbubuddin Ahamed, the leaned Counsel, appearing for the appellant, contends that the learned Assistant judge while rejecting the earlier application of the defendant under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure held that evidence is required to determine the cause of action of the filing of the suit and the said decision having been affirmed by the High Court Division in Civil Order No. 2840 of 1993 passed by the High Court Division on 27-6-1993 and as such defendant respondent was barred under law to agitate the same question by filing a second application for rejection of plaint under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code  on  the  selfsame subject matter and although the High Court Division noticed the said facts acted in access of its jurisdiction in making the Rule absolute and as such the impugned judgment of the High Court Division is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>10. Mr. Khandker Mahbubuddin Ahmed therefore argued that the impugned judgment of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 3152 of 1993 cannot be sustained in law inas­much as the High Court Division erred in not considering whether the suit is barred by <em>res judicata</em> or not is a matter to be decided at the time of trial by framing a issue to that effect and the same cannot be decided from mere reading of the plaint.<br/><br/>11. Mr. Abdus Salam Khan, the learned Advocate, appearing for the respondent No. 1, on the other hand, contended that in earlier Title Suit No. 516 of 1979  was for  Specific Performance of Contract filed by the present respondent against Bakher Ali Molla (the hus­band of the plaintiff appellant) as defendant in the said suit; that the Bakher Ali Mollah denied the agreement for sale on 15.8.1.978 and its exe­cution and as a defendant said Bakher Ali Mollah did not also state in his written state­ment that his wife is the owner of 8 annas share in the suit land rather he claimed exclusive ownership therein; that after his death all his heirs including his wife the present appellant were substituted in the earlier suit and she along with other heirs by adopting the same written statement filed appeal/Revision up to the High Court Division and also the appellate Division; and she never said that she was the owner in 8 annas share in the suit land.<br/><br/>12. Mr. Salam Khan, further argued that the appellant having lost in the earlier suit and also up to the Appellate Division, the present suit being title Suit No. 98 of 1993 has been filed by this appellant in order to harass the defendant respondent No 1. and to frustrate the decree obtained by the respondent in his earlier Title Suit No. 516 of 1979 which was for Specific Performance of Contract to obtain Kabla from the predecessor of the present appellant and in such view of the matter appeal is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>13. We have heard the learned counsels of both sides and considered their submissions on the basis of the materials on record. Having regard to the submissions made and in view of the materials on record, we are of the view that mere statement in an application for rejection of the plaint is not enough, it requires investiga­tions upon framing an issue as to whether the suit is barred by the Principle of resjudicate and the same has to be denied on evidence being adduced. In our view the trial court has taken a right view that in a matter to decide the rejec­tion of plaint it requires evidence to be adduced and we are in agreement with the findings of the trial court. The High Court Division in exercise of revisional jurisdiction ought to have consid­ered the attending facts and circumstances of the case but without doing so set aside the judg­ment of the trial court which is a total misdirec­tion under a misconception of facts and law and for which judgment of he High Court Division is liable to be set aside and the same is set aside.<br/><br/>14. In the interest of justice and equity the learned trial court is directed to decide the suit in accordance with law by framing a separate issue and deciding the same in accordance with law. The appeal is, accordingly, disposed of with the aforesaid observation. No order is made as to cost.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
