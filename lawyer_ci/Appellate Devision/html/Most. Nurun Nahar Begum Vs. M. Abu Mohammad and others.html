The facts of the case in short are that the land appertaining to S.A. Khatian No. 358 of Mouza Dedpur, Upazila Raigonj, District-Sirajgonj admittedly belonged to Mozibar  Rahman who died   leaving behind 2 sons, the pre-emptee No. 3 and 4 and 5 daughters, the pre-emptee Nos. 2,5-8 and a widow, the pre-emptee No.9. Admittedly, the pre-emptors by different registered kabala deeds have purchased 0.56 decimals of land out of the suit holding from pre-emptee Nos. 2-9 and have   become co-sharer by purchase. Further case of the pre-emptors is that the pre-emptee No.2 without any notice to the pre-emptors sold 0.07 decimals of land from Plot No.1358 and 04 decimals of land from another holding of Mouza Gobindapur in favour of pre-emptee No.1 by a kabala deed dated 5th Awsin, 1395 B.S. corresponding to 21.07.1988. The said kabala was rectified by another kabala dated 17.09.1988. The pre-emptee No.1 is a stranger purchaser to the holding. The fact of transfer was suppressed and that was disclosed by the pre-emptee No.1. Thereafter, the pre-emptor got the certified copy of the kabala on 15.10.1988 and filed the pre-emption case on 06.11.1988.<br/><br/>3. The pre-emption case was jointly contested by pre-emptee Nos.1 and 2 and by pre-emptee No.14 by filing separate written objection.<br/><br/>4. The case of the pre-emptee Nos.1 and 2 is that the pre-emtpee No.2 with a view to meet the expenses of her daughter's marriage took loan of TK.7,000.00 from pre-emptee No.1. As a security against the said loan the pre-emptee No. 1 executed the registered deed under pre-emption that the pre-emptee No.1 would reconvey the land in favour of the pre-emptee No. 2 if the latter refunds the said TK. 7,000.00 in favour of the former. Thereafter, the pre-emptee No. 2 refunded the said taka in favour of the pre-emptee No.1 and the latter by a deed of recoveyance dated 13.02.1989 re-transferred the said land in favour of the pre-emptee No.2. The land having reconveyed before passing of the final order in pre-emption Case No. 18 of 1998, the deed under pre-emption lost its weight and the pre-emption case became non-maintainable. The further case was that after reconveyance, the pre-emptee No. 2 sold the said land by a kabala deed dated 18.02.1989 in favour of the pre-emptee No. 14.<br/><br/>5. The pre-emptee No.14 by filing a written objection supported the case of the preemptee Nos.1 and 2 and further stated that after the deed of reconveyance dated 13.02.1989 was effected, the pre-emptee No. 2 again sold the said land in favour of the pre-emptee No. 14 by a kabala dated 19.02.1989 and she had been in possession of the said land.<br/><br/>6. It appears from the judgment of the High Court Division that the pre-emptee Nos. 1 and 2 after receiving the notices of the pre-emption case made collusion with each other and with a view to defeat pre-emption created a colourable deed of reconveyance by a kabala deed dated 13.02.1989. Thereafter, the pre-emptee No. 2 has created a kabala deed in favour of the pre-emptee No.14 dated 19.02.1989 showing a colourable transfer of the case land. It also appears that the deed of reconveyance dated 13.02.1989 and the kabala deed dated 19.02.1989 are sham paper transaction and without any consideration.<br/><br/>7. Md. Aftab Hossain, learned Advocate-on-record, appearing for the petitioner submits that the learned Lower Appellate Court as a final Court of fact having considered the exhibits No. 1 to 1(jha) and in an application for pre-emption the petitioner is required to file certified copy of the disputed kabala along with the application in the trial Court but the applicant failed, to do so and hence the application for pre-emption under Section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1951 is not maintainable and the said fact has not been considered by the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division by applying judicial mind. He further submits that the respondent applicant in paragraph 4 of the application for pre-emption has mentioned that opposite party No. 2 on 22.09.1988 executed and presented the document for registration containing .07 dec of the disputed land in favour of opposite party No.1 but on scrutiny the learned Lower Appellate Court found that the said kabala has been registered on 11.08.1988 in the volume which is absolutely incredible and such a finding of the learned Lower Appellate Court has not been considered by the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division. Mr. Hossain further submits that the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division having found the deed of recoveyance dated 13.02.1989 (exhibit-ka) and subsequent purchase made by the pre-emtpee No.14 by kabala dated 19.02.1989 were sham paper transactions only to defeat the pre­emption and the case comes within the mischief of the doctrine of <em>lis pendens</em>, against the weight of evidence on record both oral and documentary and to the serious prejudice to the petitioners. Last of all, Mr. Hossain submits that the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division has not applied his judicial mind properly that the doctrine of <em>lis pendens</em> as contemplated in Section 52 does not run counter to the provisions of Section 40 of the Transfer of Property Act contemplating reconveyance till final order is passed in pre-emption proceeding.<br/><br/>8. Mr. Nurul Islam Chowdhury learned Advocate, appearing for the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 submits that the learned District Judge was not justified in reversing the judgment of the trial Court without assigning cogent reasons but the High Court Division acted illegally in holding that the kabala dated 19.02.1989 in favour of pre-emptee No. 14 and the deed of reconveyance dated 13.03.1989 Exhibit-'Ka' were sham paper transaction to defeat the pre-emption. The learned Judge of the High Court Division was justified in holding that the deed of reconveyance and subsequent transfer dated 19.02.1989 comes within the mischief of the doctrine of Us pendens that the deed of reconveyance dated 13.03,1989 and the subsequent transfer dated 19.02.1989 do not come in the way of allowing pre-emption as the same are sham documents.<br/><br/>9. It appears that the High Court Division while making the Rule absolute duly considered the above submissions of the parties and arrived at a finding that the District Judge committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice in passing its judgment. Accordingly the High Court Division assigning cogent reasons made the Rule absolute.<br/>In view of above, we do not find any substance in the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner.<br/>Accordingly, this petition is dismissed without any order as to cost.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
