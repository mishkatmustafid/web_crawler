The impugned order of the. High Court Division is dated 1 June 1983 and the matter arises from O.C. Suit No. 83 of 1963 of the Court of Munsif, Rajshahi. For the purpose of disposal of this appeal history of the suit land need not be traced beyond the admitted raiyat Priyabala, who got it by settlement from the landlords Sudhir and Bijoy in 1342 B S. corresponding to 1935 A.D. Superior interest of the holding was thereafter acquired by the plaintiffs respondents by a Deed of Exchange with their properties in West Bengal whereupon Priyabala accepted  the plaintiffs as her landlords and paid rent to them in 1953. Thereafter, cont­roversy started According to the plaintiffs. Priyabala left for West Bengal for good and abandoned the holding without making any arrangement either for cultivation of the land or for payment of the rent and consequently the plaintiffs by serving a notice under section 87 of the Bengal Tenancy Act entered upon the land and took khas possession. But defendant Nos.1 and 2, wives of defendant No.6, on the basis of a spurious claim of settlement from Priyabala threatened to dis­possess the plaintiffs who then filed the suit for declaration of tide, confirmation of posse­ssion, in the alternative for recovery of posse­ssion. During the pendency of the suit, defend­ant Nos.1 and 2 transferred the land to defen­dant Nos.3 and 4 without Court's permission.<br/><br/>3. Case of the contesting defendants, particularly defendant Nos.1 and 2, is that Priyabala did not abandon the holding, but her bargader, defendant No.5, possessed the land for some time and thereafter they took settlement from Priyabala herself and got possession, and accordingly their names were recorded fu the Preliminary Rent Roll. Their further case is that though the plaintiffs had served notice under section 87 of the B.T. Act for taking khas possession the Collector did not accept their claim.<br/><br/>4. The trial Court on evidence found that Priyabala did not abandon the holding and the plaintiffs did not take khas possession thereof; but as to the defendants' claim of settlement from Priyabala, the trial Court rejected the claim holding that the settlement is bogus, void and invalid. Nevertheless, the trial Court dismissed the suit tak­ing the ground that the plaintiffs failed to establish their own claim of title and possession on the basis of abandonment of the holding. The lower Appellate Court, accepted the trial Court's finding that the defen­dant's settlement was spurious and invalid, but reversed the other finding that Priyabala did not abandon the holding. The lower Appellate Court found that Priyabala did abandon the holding without making any arrangement for payment of rent or for its cultivation and that the plaintiffs entered upon the land and took khas possession by serving a notice under section 87 of the B.T. Act. As to the possession of bargader, defendant No.5, the lower App­ellate Court found that the matter was settled amicably between him and the plaintiffs though initially defendant No. 5, had resisted the plaintiffs' possession claiming to be Priyabala’s bargader. On these findings the lower Appellate Court decreed the suit, and a learned Single Judge of the High Court Division did not find any ground to interfere with these findings of lower Appellate Court.<br/><br/>5. Mr.T.H. Khan, learned Advocate for the defendants-appellants contends that the finding that Priyabala abandoned the holding is not supported by the evidence on record, and as to the adverse finding concurrently arrived at by both the trial Court and the lower Appellate Court that the defendant's settlement from Priyabala was spurious, the learned Counsel contends that even it the defendants did not acquire any title by settle­ment yet absence of their title will not help the plaintiff’s case which must fall as they have failed to prove their own title and pos­session on the basis of abandonment of the holding.<br/><br/>6. The question of abandonment of the holding is found to have been elaborately discussed in the judgments of both the trial Court and the lower Appellate Court. It has been found by both the Courts that Priyabala left the then Pakistan and started residing in West Bengal from where she never returned to Pakistan nor did she make any arrangement for payment of the rent. As to cultivation of the land, defendant No.5, a former bargader of Priyabala, claimed to be cultivating it on behalf of the owner Priyabala. But when Priyabala did not return to country nor paid any rent the borgader’s claim of possession on behalf of the owner fell through. He resisted the plaintiffs' pos­session for a time and the plaintiffs unsuccessfully brought a criminal proceeding against him under section 144 Cr.P.C. It is at this stage that defendant Nos.1 and 2 appeared on the scene and claimed possession on the basis of the spurious settlement whereupon the plaintiffs again filed a proceeding against them all under section 144 Cr.P.C. and got a favorable order. Filing of these proceed­ings, which are quasi judicial in nature, simply shows that the petitioners' claim was sought to be thwarted in the absence of Priyabala by mere trespassers. The lower Appellate Court on Consideration of these facts and circumstances, particularly nonpayment of rent by or on behalf, of Priyabala ever since she left Pakistan, came to a clear finding that Priyabala abandoned her holding whereupon the plaintiffs entered upon the land by serv­ing a notice under section 87 of the B.T. Act. Mr. T. H. Khan contends that the plaintiffs claim as to abandonment of the holding fell through when the Collector dropped the pro­ceeding under section 87 of the B.T. Act. But it should be noted that the Collector got hardly anything to do in the matter except caus­ing a notice under section 87 to be "published in the prescribed manner". The landlords' right to enter upon the holding under section 87(1) does not depend upon Collector's dis­cretion. But if the landlord enters upon the holding by serving a notice, the raiyat may file a suit for recovery of possession of the land at any time not later than expiration of two years from the date of publication of the notice. In this case Priyabala, the raiyat, did not file any such suit as she did never return from India. In the circumstances the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division rightly refused to disturb the finding as to abandonment. We fled this decision to be Well-founded both in law and fact leaving no scope for interference. The appeal is dis­missed without any order as to costs.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
