Respondent-plaintiff instituted O.S. No. 8 of 1975 in the First Court of Subordinate Judge, Chittagong for recovery of khas possession of the suit premises after rejecting the defendant- appellant and for compensation. Briefly slated, defendant-appellant who is a temporary monthly tenant in the suit premises at a rental of Tk. 1750/= was liable to ejectment as he became a habitual defaulter, going in arrears in payment of rent from March 1973 to August 1973. Respondent required the suit premises for its own use and occupation. Instead of complying with the request to vacate the suit premises the appellant sub-let different portions of the suit premises to different tenants. Respondent issued a notice under section 106 of the Transfer of property Act on 1st September 1974 and on the expiry of one month therefrom respondent terminated the tenancy and as the appellant did not vacate the suit premises he became a trespasser in the suit premises w.e.f. 1st November 1974. Respondent claimed compensation @ Tk 200/- per day.<br/><br/>3. Defendant-appellant contested the suit by denying the material allegations made in the plaint. It was contended, <em>inter alia</em>, that the appellant was not a defaulter, rent was paid upto September 1974, respondent, however, refused to accept rent for October 1974, appellant therefore started House Rent Control case No.436 of 1974 and has been depositing rent regularly, respondent has no bonafide requirement of the suit premises, appellant did not sub-let any portion of the suit premises, aforesaid suit was filed to pressure for enhancement of existing rent and the appellant was not liable to pay compensation. The suit was, therefore, liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>4. On 26th December 1979 trial court decreed the suit for ejectment directing the appellant to hand over vacant possession of the suit premises to respondent within 15 days and also ordered the appellant to pay compensation of Tk.10,200/- to respondent for unauthorized occupation of the suit premises. Against this judgment sand decree, appellant filed First Appeal No. 34 of 1980 in the High Court Division which was dismissed on 18th July 1984. Being aggrieved the appellant moved this Court and obtained Special Leave to Appeal to consider the following, contentions-<br/>"1) Whether the learned Judges of the High Court Division were wrong in holding that the admission of the plaintiff-respondent that the defendant-appellant paid rent to it for March 1973 to August 1973 did not make a case of waiver within the meaning of the decisions of the Appellate Division reported in <em><strong>31 DLR 183 AD at page 190</strong></em> and <em><strong>33 DLR 55 AD at page 58</strong></em>.<br/>2) Whether the defendant-appellant was entitled to the protection provided by section 18(5) of the Premises Rent Control Ordinance since there had been no default in payment of rent by the defendant-appellant after the plaintiff-respondent acknowledged the payment of rents for the aforesaid period."<br/><br/>5. Mr. S. R. Pal, appellant's Counsel, Submitted that, in view of payment of rent for the months of March 1973 to August 1973 which appeared from the receipt, Exhibit A, granted by the respondent on 25th September 1973, appellant did not become a defaulter, Secondly, even if default was made by the appellant in not paying rent for the months of March 1973 to August 1973, plaintiff respondent waived such default by accepting the rent- for those months at a time.<br/><br/>6. Mr. Ranadhir Sen, learned Counsel for the plaintiff-respondent, submitted that default, once made, cannot be rectified by subsequent payment of rent. He further submitted that the acceptance of rent by the plaintiff-respondent did not constitute any waiver. Moreover, plea of waiver which is a question of fact must be taken in the pleading and has to be established by proof of some overt act indicating landlord's intention to waive such default.<br/><br/>7. Mr. Sen by referring to information gathered from the Accounts department of the office of District Judge,Chittagong on 26th December 1984 which showed nonpayment of rent for 16 months spreading over the period beginning from April 1975 to October 1978, submitted that the defendant-appellant was a defaulter. There had also been further defaults in the payment of rent for the months of September 1980, August 1981, September 1982, September 1983, September 1984, November 1984 and February 1985. All these informations were derived from the records of H.R.C. Case No.436 of 1974 in the 1st Court of Munsif, Chittagong on an application for information made by the plaintiff-respondent. Such non-payment of rent and irregular payment of rent made the defendant-appellant a defaulter, and thus disentitled him to the protection under section 18(1) read with section 18(5) of the Ordinance against the eviction from the suit premises. Since the Title Suit No.8 of 1975 out of which the present appeal has arisen was instituted on 17th January 1975, it is not necessary to consider the allegations of default' made by the defendant-appellant for the period subsequent to the date of the institution of the suit for determining whether it was liable to eviction for default.<br/><br/>8. Trial Court as well as the High Court Division concurrently found that the defendant- appellant was a defaulter in payment of rent for the months of April 1973 to August 1973. Except Ext.A which is the receipt granted by plaintiff-respondent in respect of rents from May 1973 to August 1973, no other rent receipt was produced by the defendant-appellant to show payment of rents for these months No receipt was also produced to show payment of rents for March 1973 and April 1973 in time. Having regarded to the provisions of clauses I and 5 of section 18 of the Ordinance and the facts established in the case we are unable to accept the contention that the defendant-appellant is not a defaulter.<br/><br/>9. Reference has been made to two decisions of this Court, namely,<em><strong> Ramjan Ali Mistry V. Md. Hedayetullh,(1979) 31 DLR 183 AD Profulla Kumar Chakraborty V. Anil Proshad Chowdhury, (1981) 33 DLR 55 AD </strong></em>which laid down the principle that the default made by a tenant in paying rent within time mentioned in section 18 cannot be overcome by subsequent payment of rent so as to avoid eviction and that mere acceptance of rent by the landlord paid subsequently, that is, beyond the due date will not amount to waiver. Further, whether any subsequent acceptance of rent has constituted waiver is a question of fact. The plea of waiver has, therefore, to be taken at the earliest opportunity, that is, in the pleading and evidence must be given at the trial to establish waiver.<br/><br/>10. Plaintiff-respondent's Counsel, cited a few decisions in addition to the aforesaid cases on the question of waiver, namely <em><strong>Nursing Das Tulsira V. Rahimanbai, (1904) 28 DLR Bom 440, Jugal Kishore Narain Singh V. Charoo Chandra Sur, AIR 1939 PC 159, Abul Layes V. Mst. Anwara Khatun, (1977) 29 DLR 13 SC and M/S. A. Hoque and Co. V. Al-Haj Zakir Hossain, 1984 BLD 298 AD.</strong></em><br/><br/>11. Under the Premises Rent Control Ordinance a tenant is under an obligation to pay rent within certain period after the same has become due: Section 18 provides that in the absence of any contract to the contrary between the landlord and the tenant to pay the monthly rent within a certain date it must be paid within the 15th day of the next month. These statutory restrictions relating to payment of monthly rent within certain date, if disregarded by the tenant, disentitles him to the protection against eviction for default in payment of rent. By judicial interpretation of these provisions which impose such restrictions the only exception which, if established, can take the tenant out of the mischief of those restrictions, is waiver, that is, if the tenant succeeds' in showing that though he defaulted in paying rent within the due date or dates, the landlord accepted the rent without any objection or protest. Mere acceptance of rent is not sufficient to constitute waiver. Whether there has been any waiver by the landlord must be gathered from the facts of each case. <em>Vide</em>, <em><strong>Ramzan Ali Mistry V. Md. Hadayetullah, (1979) 31 DLR 183 AD:</strong></em><br/>"There may be a case of waiver or acquiescence or such supervening facts and circumstances as to make the compliance with the enactment beyond the control of the tenant. However, it will depend on the facts of a particular case to see whether there has been default in the payment of rent in terms of the statute but once the fact is established in terms of the Ordinance, legal consequence flowing therefrom cannot be averted."<br/>Evidence, as already observed, must be given to establish the plea of waiver. Quite necessarily, the tenant is required to take the plea of waiver at the earliest opportunity, that is, in his pleading and at the trial where it should be raised as an issue.<br/><br/>12. In the case before us, it nowhere appears that the defendant-appellant made any allegation as to waiver in the written statement nor any question as to waiver was raised during the hearing of the suit. Obviously, therefore, no evidence was given in proof of such waiver.<br/><br/>13. Defendant-appellant seemed to have laid emphasis on payment of rent in lump for the months of May to August 1973 which is evidenced by the receipt, Ext.A, dated 25th September 1973. Unfortunately, the receipt, instead of being a proof of waiver, established non-payment of rent within the time prescribed by the Ordinance. In the case of <em><strong>Profulla Kumar V. Anil Proshad, (l981)33 DLR 55 AD</strong></em> of this Court it has already been decided that payment of rent in lump does not save a tenant from the mischief of the Rent Control Ordinance making him a defaulter:<br/>"A tenant by making payment of rent in lump (of rent) in terms of section 18(1) and 18(5) of the Premises Rent Control Ordinance, 1963, is not protected unless there is a contract to the contrary or such payment is covered by waiver and acquiescence on the part of the landlord. However, this is a question of fact which is to be established in each particular case by the tenant desiring to raise this as a special plea in his defence."<br/>Once a default occurs subsequent acceptance of the rent in lump by the landlord, does not, in the absence of any positive proof of his intention to waive such default, amount to waiver so as to entitle him to the protection against the consequence of default, that is, eviction.<br/><br/>14. Having regard to the clear terms of clauses I and 5 of section 18 of the Premises Rent Control Ordinance and interpretations put upon them by this Court, we are unable to hold that the appellant whose default has been established is entitled to the statutory protection against eviction.<br/>In the result the appeal is dismissed. There will, however, be no order as to costs.<br/><strong>Badrul Haider Chowdhury, J.</strong>-It is my misfortune that I could not subscribe to the reasonings given in the judgment of my lord the Chief Justice.<br/><br/>15. Since I am taking a dissenting view, it is necessary to re-state the facts.<br/><br/>16. Plaintiff-respondent brought the suit for recovery of khas possession of the suit premises after ejecting the defendant-appellant on three grounds, namely, (i) default (ii) <em>bona fide</em> requirement and (iii) sub-letting. The default period according to the plaintiff was non-payment of rent in due time from March, 1973 to August, 1973. He served notice on 1.9.73 which will be termed hereinafter as first notice. It transpired from Ext. A that the tenant defendant paid the rent of the entire period after the issuance of the first notice. This payment was accepted in lump. The landlord again served a notice on 1.9.74. The second notice was issued under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act and in paragraphs 2 and 3 it has been stated that the tenant illegally sublet the premises in violation of the agreement and further the landlord required the premises for bonafide requirement. Therefore, in paragraph 4 it is stated my client has decided to terminate your tenancy at the premises, in Schedule below on the expiry of 30th September, 1974.<br/><br/>17. In the plaint in paragraph 7 it is stated that the cause of action for the suit" arose on all dates of demand for vacant possession of the premises in schedule below and lastly on 30th Sept.1974 the dale on which the tenancy of the defendant under the plff. expired." The suit was filed on 17.1.75 and it was contested by the defendant-appellant,<br/><br/>18. The trial court decreed the suit on two grounds, namely, for default and for the bonafide requirement. In other words, the allegation of sub­letting by the tenant was not established.<br/><br/>19. On appeal the High Court Division affirmed the decree and dismissed the appeal on the grounds that the defendant was defaulter only. Here again the High Court Division found that no case-has been made out of bonafide requirement. The plaintiff has failed to prove that they required the premises bonafide for their own use and occupation. Hence the litigation ended on one ground only, namely, on the finding that the tenant was a defaulter.<br/><br/>20. It will be remembered that the second notice was given on 1.9.74 on two grounds only (a) bonafide requirement (b) sub-letting as has already been mentioned. The trial court did not accept the allegation of sub-letting and the High Court Division did not accept the ground of bonafide requirement.<br/><br/>21. In this view of the matter, the question is whether the tenancy was terminated in accordance with section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. Section 106 is a special legislation and must be read with section 108 (Q) and section 111 which for all practical purposes give protection to tenants against enhancement of rent and eviction. When the respondent served the first notice on 1.9.73 for determining the tenancy, it appears that he accepted rent for the entire period of default, that is, March 1973 to August 1973. It was accepted in lumpsum on 23.9.73 by Ext.A. Having accepted the rent the question is whether it was the case of waiver.<br/><br/>22. The second notice dated 1.9.74 was given on two grounds, namely, bonafide requirement and sub-letting which was not accepted by any Court. Hence the suit itself was without any cause of action because the case of action as pleaded was for the two grounds as mentioned in the second notice of bonafide requirement and sub-letting.<br/><br/>23. To my mind the subsequent default of payment of rent, if any, could not be taken into consideration and the learned Chief Justice whose views I have always held in high esteem mentioned in the judgment: "Since the Tide Suit No.8 of 1975 out of which the present appeal has arisen was instituted on 17th January 1975, it is not necessary to consider the allegations of default made by the defendant appellant for the period subsequent to the date of the institution of the suit for determining whether it was liable to eviction for default."<br/>Mr. S.R.Pal pointedly argued this case on this footing that if subsequent defaults are not taken into consideration then the only period of default is that March, 1973 to August, 1973 and by acceptance of rent the landlord has waived his right to sue for eviction.<br/><br/>24<em>. </em>This contention has force because if the subsequent default period is excluded from consideration then the only default period that was in 1973 was waived by the landlord by acceptance of rent. It is a clear case of waiver which essentially is a question to be found from the conduct of the parties. The conduct is evident from Ext. A. the acceptance of rent in lump on 25.9.73. The cause of action of the suit in pursuance of the second notice dated 1.9.74, namely, bonafide requirement and sub­letting was not established and the suit ought to have been dismissed on this ground alone.<br/><br/>25. There is high authority for the proposition as to what amounts to waiver. <em>See</em>. <strong><em>A.I.R. 1939 (P.C.) 159</em></strong> and the distinction between the waiver and the acquiescence can be appreciated from the decision of the Privy Council in<em><strong> 26 I.A.56.</strong></em><br/><br/>26. This Court in <em><strong>33 DLR (A.D) 55</strong></em> also took the view that waiver is a question of fact which is to be established in each particular case by the tenant desiring to raise this as a special pleading in his case.<br/><br/>27. Keeping in mind the principle of waiver and acquiescence I am inclined to take the view that in the facts of this case, a case of waiver has been made out.<br/><br/>28. Mr. Sen took the ground that the waiver was not pleaded in the written-statement. The rules of pleading do not require the question of fact to be narrated in the pleading which can be established by evidence. Exhibit-A is the evidence. Hence is seems that there is no substance in that point.<br/><br/>29. Now the question of waiver. In<em><strong> Selwyn V. Garfit 38 Ch. D. 273 (1888) </strong></em><strong>Bowen, LJ.</strong> Posed a question "what is waiver." Delay is not waiver though it may be the evidence of waiver. Waiver is consent to dispense with the notice. In the case of <em><strong>Ram Chunder Banka V. Rawatmull</strong></em> reported in <em><strong>19 C.W.N. 1172</strong></em> this dictum was construed "waiver is consent to dispense with or forego something to which a person is entitled. It seems to me that such consent may be by express agreement between the parties or implied from the receipt of an overdue instalment." In that case it was proved that the demand was made in three successive years in, respect of 3 instalments due upon an instalment bond, but the plaintiff consented not to sue for the whole amount as he was entitled to do under the bond for default on the first two occasions but refused to consent on the third. It was held that this amounted to a waiver of the payment of the two earlier instalments.<br/><br/>30. In<em><strong> Easin Khan V. Abdul Wahab Sikdar </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> C.W.N. 10 </strong></em>a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court noticed that two useful tests may be applied to determine whether there has been an actual waiver (i) whether the payment subsequently accepted may be looked upon as a valuable consideration for the renunciation of the decree-holder's rights (ii) whether the decree-holder has by his conduct intentionally caused the judgment-debtors to believe that he has renounced his right. In that case there was an instalment decree and the judgment-debtor defaulted in making payment of the instalment. He, however, deposited the instalment subsequently with interest which was accepted by the decree-holder. The question was whether it was a waiver and the Division Bench took the view that the question of waiver is a moot question of law and fact. It was observed:<br/>"The conduct of the decree-holders, however, lulled the judgment-debtors into a sense of security. They proceeded on the assumption that the decree-holders had waived the default and accepted the deposit and they continued to make from time to time other deposits in satisfaction of the subsequent instalments. It does not lie in the mouth of the decree-holder now to contend that they accepted the payments on an entirely different footing," It was held that the High Court can interfere on this ground in the second appeal.<br/><br/>31. In the case of <em><strong>Jahandar Baksh Mallik V. Ram Lal Hazrah </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> 37 Cal 449</strong></em> it was observed:<br/>"If, therefore a party deliberately waives a legal right to which he is entitled, and no question of contravention of public policy or morality arises, such waiver is" operative.-In other words, if the waiver is supported by an agreement founded on a valuable consideration, or is of such a character as to slop the party from insisting on the right claimed to have been relinquished, the party who has waived his right cannot subsequently turn round and claim to enforce the right he has deliberately waived."<br/><br/>32. In the case of<em><strong> Humayun Properties V Ferrazzinis Ltd. </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> A.I.R. 1963 Cal. 473 </strong></em>it was observed:<br/>"Where a party 'has two rights, the mere exercise of one right does not amount to waiver of the other, but if there are alternative rights, the exercise of one right might imply that the party had waived the exercise of the other."<br/>In the present case, the plaintiff served the notice determining the tenancy on 1.9.73 because of the default in payment of rent and the period was specified as March 1973 to August 1973. The plaintiff had right to evict the defendant for default. But he accepted the payment of rent on 25.9.73 by Ext.A. He had an alternative right either to throw him out or to accept the-payment and continuation of the tenancy. He did the latter, that is, he accepted the payment and allowed the defendant tenant to continue on the tenancy right. He gave second notice on 1.9.74 and in that notice he determined the tenancy on 2 grounds, namely, bonafide requirement and sub-letting. Clearly this was a waiver insofar as default is concerned. In his cause of action also he specified the reasons for bringing the suit by stating that he required the premises bonafide and eviction was sought also for sub-letting. Curiously enough neither the trial Court nor the High Court Division accepted the ground of bonafide requirement or sub­letting but the suit was decreed for, default of payment of rent which was waived by the plaintiff himself.<br/><br/>33. In the case of <em><strong>Jugal Kishore Narain Singh and others V. Charoo Chandra Sur and other, </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> A.I.R. 1939 P.C. 159</strong></em> the Privy Council considered the conduct of the parties and the legal consequence which flowed from such conduct. It was observed:<br/>"In their Lordships' opinion however an affirmation by conduct is not inconsistent with the contention and is implicit in the claim."<br/><br/>34. Precisely that has happened in this case. The plaintiff not only accepted the payment of rent in lump to allow the defendant to continue on his tenancy and the defendant now has taken the plea that the plaintiff had waived the default and such contention is not inconsistent with the conduct rather it is implicit in the claim of the defendant.<br/><br/>35. In this view of the matter, I have no hesitation to accept the contention of Mr. Pal that the plaintiff had waived the default and lulled the defendant into a sense of security. Notwithstanding the concurrent finding of the trial court and the High Court Division that there is no waiver, I would rather rely on <em><strong>Lala Beni Ram V. Kundan Lall </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> 26 I.A. 58 </strong></em>that such finding is not binding upon this Court as the Privy Council observed:<br/>"But acquiescence is not a question of fact but of legal inference from the facts so found and upon it the judgments of the Appellate Courts are not final."<br/><br/>36. To my mind in this case waiver has been established as a fact by three broad circumstances, namely, by Ext. A by acceptance of payment, continuation of tenancy for the subsequent period and the cause of action for bringing this suit-all these three have, proved as a fact that the plaintiff waived the default and now the question of legal inference from such facts as the Privy Council mentioned had become a question of law. This is acquiescence. In the result, therefore I would allow this appeal on the ground that the suit is liable to be dismissed because of waiver and acquiescence.<br/><strong>Shahabuddin Ahmed J. -</strong> I have gone through the judgments written by my Lord, the Chief justice and my learned brother <strong>Badrul Haider Chowdhury J</strong>: I concur with the judgment of my Lord the Chief Justice.<br/><strong>M.H.Rahman J.-</strong>1 have had the advantage of going through the judgments proposed to be delivered by my Lord, the Chief Justice and my learned brother <strong>Badrul Haider Chowdhury, J.</strong> concur with the judgment of my Lord the Chief Justice.<br/><strong>A.T.M.Afzal J.</strong>-I have gone through the judgments written by my Lord, the Chief Justice and my learned brother <strong>Badrul Haider Chowdhury J.</strong>; I concur with the judgment of my Lord, the Chief Justice.<br/><strong>Order of the Court.</strong><br/>By the majority decision, the appeal is dismissed.
