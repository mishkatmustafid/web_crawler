Leave was granted to consider the question whether the view of the Appellate Court below that the bonafide requirement of the lessor would be fulfilled if only one room is spared and whether the adjustment of taxes which were paid by the tenant in pursuance of distress warrant is ad­justable against the rent due.<br/><br/>2. Plaintiff-respondent instituted 2 suits in the 1st Court of Sadar, Munsif, Mymensingh. O.C. Suit No. 135 of 1964 was bro­ught against Nurul Islam and O.C. Suit No, 136 of 1964 was brought against Esarunnessa Bibi, the predecessor of the appellants. Two suits were in respect of two distinct tenancies, which are shop rooms situated in the Munici­pal holding No. 7 A.B. Guha Road, Mymensingh, which the respondent claimed to have purchased by registered kabala dated 29.7.63. In the case of Nurul Islam, the decree was passed and he had been ejected. Now in the case of Esarunnessa, the trial Court found that the tenant had defaulted in paying rent to the respondent and further the respondent required the premises for starting a business of Cabinet Firm show-room. In this view of the matter, the suit was decreed. On appeal, the Appellate Court below came to the con­clusion that the tenant could not be said to be a defaulter, inasmuch as the rent was not due in view of the Municipal taxes that had been paid by the tenant in pursuance of a dis­tress warrant and the defendants, "did well in paying the arrear Municipal tax which they are entitled to adjust towards rent." As for the bonafide requirement the Appellate Court below found that "he does not require both the premises for his show room,'' considering the evidence it was concluded "for show-room one of the premises is sufficient." In this view of the matter, the judgment and decree of the trial Court was set aside and the suit was dis­missed and the appeal was allowed.<br/><br/>3. The High Court Division took the view that the Appellate Court below was wrong in taking the view that the tenant was not a defaulter. It was observed:<br/>"Since the Ordinance has not provided for adjustment of Municipal taxes paid by the tenant to be adjusted against the rent payable by him, the same could not be adjusted against the rent.''<br/>It was considered that the bonafide require­ment was found by the trial Court and it was ''not proper for the Appellate Court to come to a finding without any material before it" for the finding of the Appellate Court below that for a show-room one of the premises is sufficient. In this view of the matter, the judgment of the Appellate Court below was set aside and the judgment and decree passed by the trial Court were restored.<br/><br/>4. Leave was granted, as noticed, to con­sider both the points, namely, as to the bona­fide requirement and the adjustment of the taxes paid by the tenant in pursuance of a distress warrant. It was noticed in the leave order that it was a case of first impression.<br/><br/>5. Mr. Khondker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, the learned Counsel appearing for the tenant-appellants, placed before us the particulars of the tenancy, which are re-produced as under:<br/>Monthly rent Tk. 35/-<br/>(i) Plaintiff's purchase from the previous owner on 29.7.63=12th Sraban 1370 B.S.<br/>(ii) Information about purchase was given on 3.9.63 =17th Bhadra 1370 B.S.<br/>(iii) Defendant tendered rent on 24.9.63 =7<sup>th</sup> Aswin 1370 B.S. which was refused by the plaintiff,<br/>(iv) Defendant paid Municipal Tax against distress warrant on 27.10.63 =Tk. 311.75 and again on 18.3.64 Tk. 66.00.<br/>(v) Defendant deposited rent in H.R. Case No 53 of 1964 on 12.5.64 Tk. 42.25<br/>(vi) Plaintiff brought the suit on 18.9.64, Mr. Ahmed contended that the rent is due only for 9 months from Sravan to Chaitra 1370 B.S. which @ Tk. 35/- amounts to Tk. 314.00. Whereas the defendant paid in all Tk. 311.75 +Tk. 66.00 as against the taxes + Tk. 42.25 as deposited rent and the total comes to Tk. 420.00. It is submitted that the figures show that there was no rent due from the tenant for which the eviction could be sought. As for the bonafide requirement Mr. Ahmed placed before us the paragraph of the Appellate Court below:—<br/>"The tenants' difficulties have also to be looked into. They have been doing business in the premises since 1951. The holding contains nine rooms in all (vice Ext.3) 7 rooms in one row and the two suit premises in the front row. In the vacant space in between the plaintiff has constructed the tin shed where he has started to make furniture. For show­room one of the premises is sufficient. There is no evidence of dimension of the suit premises. At the time of argument, the learned lawyers of both sides ascer­tained from their clients that the premises occupied by defendant Esarunnessa is a little bigger than the other one and it has a better frontage. The rent is also Rs. 5/-more than the other premises. Under the circumstances, I think, Esarunnessa should be allowed to continue her busi­ness in the premises occupied by her. The plaintiff may take possession of the other premises occupied by defendant Nurul Islam for the purpose of his show­room."<br/><br/>6. Mr. B N. Chowdhury learned Coun­sel, appearing for the respondent argued that the tax that had been paid by the defendant was due from previous owner and payment of such tax by the tenant cannot be adjusted. Secondly, he argued that the bonafide require­ment which has been found by the trial Court should not have been disturbed by the Appel­late Court.<br/><br/>7. The second point of Mr B. N. Chow­dhury has no substance inasmuch as finding of the Appellate Court below could not be assail­ed on the ground of any absence of evidence For such finding the Appellate Court below is the last court of fact and the passage quoted above from the judgment of the Appellate Court below shows not only application of mind but considerable anxiety of the Appel­late Court below to do justice in the facts and circumstances of the case. Such finding deserves consideration and the opinion is this find­ing of the Appellate Court below is justified and accordingly it is affirmed. As for the second point, namely, as to the adjustment of the tax which has been rightly mentioned as the case of first impression, the relevant law deserves consideration.<br/><br/>8. The admitted position is that the defendants did pay arrear Municipal tax. The question is whether such payment of taxes is adjustable against the rent. The learned Single Judge did not find any authority in law and opined "the same could not be adjusted aga­inst the rent payable by him.” The evidence is that the defendants paid the rent inasmuch as distress warrant was issued against the pre­vious owner. Be it noted that the plaintiff purchased the property, from Suprosonna, the previous owner, on 29-7-63 and the defendants paid the Municipal tax against distress warrant on 27-10-63.<br/><br/>9. Distress warrant is one of the most effectual remedies for recovery of rent and taxes. The term 'distress' primarily connotes a summary remedy by which the person is entitled without further legal process to take into his possession the effects belonging to another person for payment of rent and taxes, etc.<br/><br/>10. Section 38 of the Municipal Admi­nistration Ordinance, 1960 provides:<br/>“Except as otherwise provided by these rules the tax which is assessed on the annual value of building shall be payable by the owner of the building and in the event of default by the owner, it may be recovered from the occupier, if any, by attachment of any rent due by such occupier to the owner. When rent is attached under this rule it shall be recoverable by the Committee in the manner provided in rules 12 to 15."<br/>Thus it is clear that tax dues can be recovered in the event of default by the owner from the occupier as well. Rule 13 provides for the power to recover arrears of taxes, etc., by distress and sale of move-able property. Section 63 (3) Local Govern­ment Ordinance, 1976 reads as under:<br/>"Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-section (2), the Government may empower any local parishad to recover arrears of taxes, rates, tolls, fees and other moneys claimable by the pari­shad under this Ordinance by distress and sale of the movable property bel­onging to the person concerned, or by attachment and sale of the immov­able property belonging to him."<br/>Thus it is clear that one of the modes of recovery of tax is by way of distress warrant.<br/><br/>11. The next thing whether it is adjust­able. Section 14(1) of the Premises Rent Con­trol Ordinance reads as under:<br/>Where any sum has been paid or depos­ited on or after the date of the com­mencement of this ordinance in respect of occupation of any premises,<br/>(b)"as premium, salami, fine or other like imposition or as rent in advance. the claiming or the receiving of which is prohibited under this Ordinance, the Controller may, on application made to him in this behalf at any time within a period of six months from the date of such payment or deposit by the tenant by whom such payment or de­posit was made, order the landlord, by whom such payment was received or to whose credit such deposit was made, to refund such sum to such tenant 01, at the option of such tenant, order the adjustment of any sums paid or dep­osited in any other manner."<br/>Reading section 18 (2) along with section 14 (b) there is no hesitation in saying that the axes due on the property were recoverable from the occupier in the absence of the owner and since the owner Suprosonna has transferred his property to the plaintiff that will not <em>ipso facto</em> make out a case for bonafide requirement of the ‘landlord', provided the tenant is ready and willing to pay rent. The payment of arrear tax which was paid to the credit of the previous owner is adjustable, if the application is made before the Controller at the option of the tenant when the Controller will be obliged to order the adjustment of any sum so paid or deposited in any other manner.<br/>Analysis of the aforesaid provisions of law leaves no room for doubt that such payment of tax is adjustable and authorised by law.<br/><br/>12. Mr. Chowdhury made a feeble attempt by saying that the present landlord cannot be deprived of the rent of the property id if any taxes have been paid that must ; adjustable against the arrears of rent to the previous owner. The argument is fallacious. Section 109 of the Transfer of Property Act is the complete answer.<br/><br/>13. Section 109 provides for the rights of the lessor's transferee and it says "but the lessor shall not, by reason only of such transfer, cease to be subject to any of the liabilities imposed upon him by the lease." Here the lessor was Suprosonna and he transferred the property to the plaintiff, the transferee and the law is that by reason only of such transfer Suprosonna cannot escape the liabilities. The liability is to pay the Municipal tax and by reason of such transfer Suprosonna could not escape the liability imposed upon him for the lease. In other words, he is under obligation by the Municipal law to pay taxes and the arrear of taxes had been paid by the tenant-defendant-appellant as against the rent but that will not entitle the transferee plaintiff to arrears of the rent due before the trans­fer because the proviso runs as follows:<br/>"Provided that the transferee is not entitled to arrears of rent due before the transfer, and that, if the lessee, not having reason to believe that such transfer has been made, pays rent to the lessor, the lessee shall not be liable to pay such rent over again to the transferee."<br/><br/>14. As it has been noticed that section 14(b) Rent Control Ordinance provides for adjustment of payment of taxes which would come within the meaning of the expression ''other like imposition." Thus the position is this Municipal tax dues had been paid by the tenant and the previous owner had transferred the property to the plaintiff and the law authorised adjustment of such payment, Therefore, the transferee, the plaintiff, cannot claim the rent over again from the tenant defendant-appellant.<br/><br/>15. In this view of the matter, the Appellate Court below had taken the correct view that the tenant was not a defaulter.<br/>In the result, therefore, this appeal is allowed. Judgment and order of the High Court Division are set aside and those of the Appellate Court below are restored. No order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
