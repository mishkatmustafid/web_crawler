The subject-matter of the suit is a piece of land measuring 15 decimals, a part of C.S. Plot No.45 having an area of 8.24 acres appertaining to khatian No.306 of mouza Dakshin Chandpur, P.S. Damurhuda.<br/><br/>3. The suit plot originally belonged to Lalit Mohan who at his death was survived by his 3 sons - Santosh Kumar, Nripendra Kumar and Birendra Kumar. The plaintiffs claimed that one Banamali Biswas had pur­chased and got into possession of the suit land from the "said heirs by registered kabala dated 13 June1939 (Ext.1 b). Banamali Biswas sold the land to Jagabandhu Saha by a registered kabala dated 23 April 1947 (Ext. 1a). Jagabandhu exchanged the land with that of the plain­tiffs by a registered deed dated 2 July 1955 (Ext. 1), which was termed as a kabala. The plaintiffs had been in possession of the land since the exchange. The defendant had surreptiously raised a tin-shed thereon on 20 July 1962 and thus dispossessed the plain­tiffs giving cause of action for the sun.<br/><br/>4. The defence was that the defendant had leasehold right in 16½. decimals of land including the suit land by means of unregistered amalnama dated 15 February, 1951 from Santosh Kumar, one of the sons of Lalit Mohan and that he was in possession of the land. The defendant also disput­ed the identity of the suit land.<br/><br/>5. The learned Munsif of Chuadanga tried the suit. On consideration of the evi­dence on record he held that the suit land was quite identifiable and that the plaintiffs had both title and possession in the same till they were dispossessed by the defendant on the basis of a false ainalnama. He accord­ingly decreed the suit.<br/><br/>6. The defendant took an appeal, Title Appeal No.16 of 1964 to the District Judge. The appeal was on transfer, heard by the learned Subordinate Judge, Kushtia, who agreed with all the findings of the trial Court and affirmed its decision.<br/><br/>7. The unsuccessful defendant then pre­ferred Second Appeal No. 1077 of 1966 to the High Court Division. A Single Bench of the said Court, by the impugned judgment and decree, set aside the concurrent deci­sions of the trial Court and the first appellate Court and dismissed the suit on the ground that<sup>:</sup> the suit land was not identifiable and therefore the plaintiffs could not prove their title and possession in the suit land.<br/><br/>8. The plaintiffs thereafter presented this appeal. The precise question on which leave was granted is whether the High Court Division had acted beyond its jurisdiction in upsetting, in second appeal, the findings of fact arrived at by the trial Court and the first appellate Court.<br/><br/>9. Appearing on behalf of the appellants Mr. Moinul Hossain, learned Counsel, has submitted that the High Court Division fell into an error of law in relying upon an extraneous document, namely, the revision­al settlement map for coming to the conclu­sion that there is a pathway between the suit land and the land of Sajeda which was described by the plaintiffs as the eastern boundary land and thereby interfering with the concurrent findings of fact made by the trial Court and the first appellate Court regarding the location and identity of the suit land. He has also submitted that the other findings as to title, possession of the plaintiffs and dispossession by the defen­dant also being concurrent findings were not subject to interference by the High Court Division in second appeal. The only point urged before the High Court Division was that proper identification and actual location of the suit land were not estab­lished. The plaintiffs had described the suit land in the schedule of the plaint and also appended a sketch map thereto. The defen­dant also appended a sketch map to his written statement to contend that the suit land was not identical with the land claimed by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs had described their land to be bound on the east by the land of one Sajeda. The defence sketch map indicated a pathway in between the suit land and the land of Sajeda. The trial Court and the first appellate Court both found that an imaginary pathway was brought into existence by the defendant with a malafide intention of creating confu­sion about the location of the suit land and further that the four boundaries given in the plaint related to the suit land and no other land. For coming to this conclusion the said two Courts had elaborately discussed the material evidence adduced by the parties, more particularly the amalnama, Ext.4. In this Ext.4 the defendant's alleged lessor Santosh, while granting lease to Sajeda, described the land under lease to have been bounded on the west by the land of Banamali.<br/><br/>10. The judgment of the High Court Division shows that the findings of the Courts below were reversed on the basis of a pathway which the High Court Division supposed to have existed running along the eastern boundary of the suit land and that both the plaintiffs and the defendant, as a matter of fact, had claimed two different parcels of land. The said Court found that the description of the land claimed by the plaintiffs was rendered vague for non-spec­ification of the pathway by the Courts below. In the same breath the High Court Division said that defendant's title to the suit land was clear and that the question of possession was irrelevant.<br/><br/>11. For coming to such conclusions which are evidently contradictory in terms the High Court Division relied upon the sketch map of the defendant and also a revisional settlement map which was not before the Court of first instance and the first appellate Court. On the other hand, the High Court Division had nothing to criticize Ext. 4 which clearly indicated the western boundary of Sajeda's land. This shows that the High Court Division had no cogent ground or legal evidence to depart from the findings of the two Courts below. It is well-settled that there is no jurisdiction to enter­tain a second appeal on the ground of an erroneous finding of fact, however gross or inexcusable the error may seem to be, unless there is an error of law or procedure, which has affected the decision on merits. The decisions arrived at by both the lower Courts were neither contrary to law nor was there any substantial error or defect in the procedure followed by them. In the circum­stances the question posed before us in this appeal becomes easy to answer. The High Court Division ought not to have interfered with the concurrent decisions of the lower Courts. The impugned judgment of the High Court Division does not therefore deserve to stand.<br/><br/>12. The appeal is accordingly allowed and the judgment and decree of the High Court Division are set aside and those of the lower Courts restored. There shall be no order as to costs.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
