The facts in short are that one Syed Mozammel Hossain was the owner of 18J/2 decimals of land in C.S. and S.A. Plot No. 841 and one decimal in C.S. and S.A. Plot No. 843. He transferred .0668 acres of land to one Rabeya Khatun by two regis­tered deeds dated 24.10.1987 and 26.10.1987. After purchase, the said Rabeya Khatun mutated her name in respect of the aforesaid lands. She trans­ferred the said land to the appellant- pre-emptor by a registered deed of <em>Heba bil Ewaj</em> on 28.1.1991. The aforesaid Syed Mozammel Hossain, respondent no.2, subsequently transferred another piece of land measuring 0.0878 acre, the case-land, in favour of one Khaleda Rahman, pre-emptee-respondent No.1, by a registered deed of sale dated 8.6.1991, without any notice to the appellant petitioner, The peti­tioner in due course, came to know about the transfer and thereafter filed a pre-emp­tion case being Pre-emption Miscellaneous Case No. 80 of 1991 under section 24 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949, contending inter alia, that the purchaser respondent No.1 is a stranger to the case-land while he is a co-sharer. The purchaser respondent No.1 (pre-emptee) contested the miscellaneous case contending <em>inter alia</em> that the case land was sold in her favour and that nei­ther the pre-emptor nor his mother is a co-sharer in the case land, as such, he has got no right to pre-empt the case land.<br/><br/>3. During the pendency of the pre-emption case, the pre-emptee respondent no. 1 filed a suit being the Title Suit No. 131 of 1993 on 2.5.1993, in the Court of Assistant Judge, First Court, Dhaka, with the prayer for decree for declaration that the deed of <em>Heba bel Ewaj</em> dated 28.1.1991 executed and registered by Rabeya Khatun in favour of her son, the defendant-petition­er is null and void and for a further decla­ration that the pre-emptor and his mother are not co-sharers in respect of the case-land. Thereafter, the pre-emptee respon­dents filed an application on 11.7.93, praying for staying the further proceed­ings of the said Pre-emption Miscellaneous Case No. 80 of 1991, till the date of pre-emptory hearing of the above Title Suit No.131 of 1993, is fixed. But his prayer was rejected by the learned Assistant Judge by his order No. 37 dated 14.7.1993, as such, the respondent pre-emptee preferred a civil revision being Civil Revision No.2116 of 1993 and a Rule was issued on 1.8.1993 and all fur­ther proceedings of the pre-emption case was stayed till disposal of the said Rule. In the meantime, the aforesaid title suit was re-numbered as Title Suit No. 5 of 1995 on being transferred to the 4th Court of Additional Assistant Judge, Dhaka.<br/><br/>4. After hearing, the said suit was dis­missed by a judgment and order dated 31.7.1994. The appeal was also dismissed on 26.9.1995. This order was affirmed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 600 of 1996, by its judgment and order dated 19.5.1997. The Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 714 of 1997 before this Division was also dismissed by an order dated 12.11.1997. In the mean­time, the Civil Revision No. 2116 of 1993, previously filed by the pre-emptee-respondent, was also discharged by an order dated 19.6.1996. Thereafter, the Pre-emption Miscellaneous Case No. 80 of 1991, proceeded in the trial Court and after a contested hearing the said case was dismissed by the trial Court by its judg­ment and order dated 25.5.1999.<br/><br/>5. On appeal, the learned Additional District Judge, by his judgment and order dated 6.3.2002, allowed the petition and granted pre-emption in favour of the appellant petitioner. But on a revisional application being Civil Revision No.1979 of 2000, the High Court Division upon hearing the parties set aside the judgment and order passed in appeal and refused pre-emption. Being aggrieved, the appellant-petitioner-pre-emptor filed the instant appeal before this Division.<br/><br/>6. Leave was granted to consider firstly, as to whether the alleged mutation in the name of the petitioner's mother was actu­ally made by a competent authority in accordance with the provision of section 117(1)(c) of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act and the payment of rents in separate <em>jama</em> was proper, that as to whether the appellant's mother ceased to be a co-sharer, secondly, as to whether the findings arrived at in the judgment and decree passed in Title Suit No. 5 of 1994, act as<em> res judicata</em> in respect of the issues involved in the Pre-emption Miscellaneous Case No. 80 of 1991.<br/><br/>7. Mr. T.H. Khan, Senior Advocate, appears on behalf of the appellant (pre-emptor). He submits that the judgment of the Trial Court below in refusing the pre­emption, was passed on an erroneous find­ing that Rabeya Khatun, the mother of the petitioner, mutated her name and separat­ed the jama but as a matter of fact no such separation of jama was made in accordance with the provisions of section 117 (1)(c) of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, after notifying all the other co-sharers but mutated her name only in order to deposit the ground rent to the rev­enue authority in respect of her purchased land, rather, this mutation and the alleged separation of <em>jama</em> was made illegally and has got no relevance in a pre-emption pro­ceeding. When confronting with the admission of the pre-emptor as to the mutation and payment of rent on the basis of a separation of <em>jama</em> by his mother, the learned Advocate submits that this was a bona fide mistake of fact and not support­ed by any evidence on record, as such, Rabeya Khatun the mother of the pre-emptor never ceased to be a co-sharer in the <em>jama</em> as was erroneously found by the trial Court. He further submits that during the pendency of the pre-emption case, the pre-emptee filed a title suit praying for a decree for declaration that the deed of <em>heba bil ewaj</em> executed and registered by Rabeya Khatun in favour of her son, was null and void and that the pre-emptor and his vendor are not co-sharers in the case-land. But his suit was dismissed by the trial Court which was affirmed up to the Appellate Division. In this respect, the learned Advocate submits that the findings arrived at in the said suit on contest, act as <em>res judicata</em> in the issues involved so far the co-sharership of the appellant and his mother is concerned, as such, he submits that the High Court Division wrongly and erroneously made the Rule absolute and upheld the order of rejection of the prayer for pre-emption by the trial Court.<br/><br/>8. On the other hand, Mr. Syed Mahbubur Rahman, the learned Advocate-On-Record, submits that the Courts below found that after separation of <em>jama</em> and mutation of the name of Rabaya Khatun in respect of her own purchased land, she ceased to be a co-sharer in the case-land. Besides, the findings of the trial Court in Title Suit No. 5 of 1994, in disallowing the prayer for declaration that the deed of <em>Heba bil Ewaj</em> as null and void and the defendant No. 1 Md. Ali in the case-land, was not a co-sharer, would not help the pre-emptor in his pre-emption case. The pre-emptor in order to obtain the pre-emp­tion of the case-land has to prove his case on the balance of probabilities on its own merit and is not entitled to depend on the findings of the Court in another suit.<br/><br/>9. We have heard the learned Advocates of both the parties and perused the papers in the paper book.<br/><br/>10. It appears that the appellant filed the pre-emption case praying, <em>inter alia,</em> for pre-empting the deed of sale, executed by Syed Mozammel Hossain, the respondent No. 2 and registered on 8.6.1991, in favour of the pre-emptee- respondent No.1<br/><br/>11. After hearing, the learned Assistant Judge, by his judgment dated 25.5.1999 found that admittedly the petitioner's, mother got her share separated from the<em> jama </em>by the mutation process in her own name, long before the transaction and thereby he held that the petitioner's moth­er as well as the petitioner himself separat­ed the jama and accordingly ceased to be the co-sharer, as such, the petitioner is debarred from claiming pre-emption.<br/><br/>12. On appeal, the learned Additional District Judge, held that Rabeya Khatun although separated her <em>jama</em> and mutated her name in respect of the case land but as a matter of fact, did not cease to be a co-sharer therein. The learned Judge based his findings, firstly, on the ground that had she ceased to be a co-sharer then the pre-emptee would not have filed a separate suit. Besides, he found that the said sepa­rate <em>jama</em> was only for the purpose of pay­ment of ground rent to the revenue author­ity and nothing more. The High Court Division in civil revision however, found that admittedly the pre-emptor's mother having mutated her name, paid rents in respect of the case-land. The pre-emptor himself filed the mutation khatian which was marked 'X' and it is clear from the said mutation khatian that his mother mutated her name after purchase of 0.0660 acres of land and a new khatian being No.732/7-1 was opened in her name as far back as in the year 1987 whereas the kabala under pre-emption is dated 8.6.91. The learned Judge of the Court Division also noticed that after sep­aration of the khatian the pre-emptor's mother paid rent separately and thus the order of mutation has been given effect to and acted upon. As such, the learned Judge held that no question of irregularity arose in separating the case-land by a sep­arate khatian within the meaning of sec­tion 117 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act and accordingly, the question of pre-emption does not arise.<br/><br/>13. The learned Judge of the High Court Division found that the only issue which was decided by the trial Court in Title Suit No. 5 of 1994, instituted by the pre-emptee was in respect of the validity of the deed of <em>Heba bel Ewaj</em> by which Rabeya Khatun transferred the land pur­chased by her in favour of her son, the pre-emptor. He further found that the question of co-sharership of the pre-emptor was not at all decided in the said suit, as such, it was rightly decided in the instant pre­emption case, although against the   pre-emptor. On these findings, the learned Judge of the High Court Division held that the issue of co-sharership is not barred by the principle of <em>res judicata,</em> waiver and acquiescence, as submitted on behalf of the pre-emptor.<br/><br/>14. It appears that it is specifically stated at paragraph-1 of the petition of Pre-emp­tion Miscellaneous Case No. 80 of 1991 as follows:<br/>“ সৈয়দ মোজাম্মেল হোসেন যথাক্রমে ২৪-১০-১৯৮৭ ইং তারিখ এবং ৩১-১০-১৯৮৭ ইং তারিখে দুইখানা সাফ বিক্রয় কবলা দলিল সম্পাদন ও রেজিষ্ট্রি করতঃ বিক্রীত সম্পত্তি দখল মোসাঃ রাবেয়া খাতুনের বরাবরে বুঝাইয়া দিলে তাহাতে মোসাঃ রাবেয়া খাতুন সম্পুর্ণ রুপে মালিক স্বত্বাধিকারীনি নিয়ন হইয়া মালিক সরকারের তাহার নিজ নাম জারী করতঃ খাজনাদি প্রদানে তাহাতে ভোগ দখল করিতে থাকেন”।“(পেপার বুক পাতা নং ১১১)<br/><br/>15. Besides, in paragraph 3 of the petition it is stated:<br/>খাজনা আদায়/পরিশোধের সুবিধার্থে নালিশী দাগের ভূমিতে নিজ নিজ অংশে নাম খারিজ করতঃ খাজনা পরিশোধ করিয়া আসিতেছে। পেপার বুক পাতা নং ১১২)<br/><br/>16. The mutation khatian prepared by the <em>Tahsilder </em>was produced in Court and was marked 'X'. This was produced at the instance of the pre-emptor himself. In his examination-in-chief, he stated as follows:<br/>“আমার মার নামে নামজারী করা হয়েছে। পর্চার খসড়া দাখিল দিলাম ২১-১১-১৯৮৭ তারিখে নামজারী হয়। খসড়া পর্চা মার্কড-ঢ আমার মা খাজনা দিয়েছেন। সেই খাজনা রশিদ ১ টা প্রদঃ ২। এস,এ পর্চার সইমূহুরী নকল দাখিল দিলাম প্রদঃ ৩। (পেপার বুক পাতা নং ১১১)।<br/><br/>17. On perusal of the Khatian No.732/7-1, it appears that the case land was record­ed in the name of Mrs. Rabeya Khatun in pursuance of the Mutation Case No. 19455 of 1987 dated 17.11.1987 signed by the <em>Tahsilder</em> on 21.12.1987(Marked-X). It appears from those statements and doc­uments that the High Court Division right­ly found that there was a proper separa­tion of <em>jama</em> and mutation was effected in favour of Mrs. Rabeya Khatun, mother of the pre-emptor. So far the contention that the findings of the Court in Title Suit No. 5 of 1994, is binding upon the learned Assistant Judge, in disposing of the Pre­emption Miscellaneous Case No. 80 of 1991 is concerned, we have gone through the judgment passed by the trial Court, the appellate Court, the judgment passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 600 of 1991 dated 19.5.1997 and also the judgment of dismissal of Leave Petition No. 714 of 1997 arising therefrom and passed by the Appellate Division on 12.11.1997.<br/><br/>18. It appears from the plaint of Title Suit No. 131 of 1993 filed by the pre-emptee that it was prayed <em>inter alia</em> that the deed of <em>heba bil ewaj</em> no. 420 executed by the defendant No. 2 in favour of the defendant No.1 (preemptor) and registered on 28.11.1991 was null and void and the defendant No.1 is not a co-sharer in the case land. The trial Court refused to hold the aforesaid <em>heba bil ewaj</em> null and void and since the said deed was not so declared it was held that it was not possi­ble to give a declaration that the defendant No.1 was not a co-sharer in the case-land (Paper book Page No. 146).<br/><br/>19.  On appeal, the appellate Court, dis­missed the appeal, and refused to hold the deed of <em>heba bil ewaj</em> as null and void. On revision before the High Court Division, the judgments of the Courts below were affirmed in Civil Revision No. 600 of 1996 by the judgment passed on 19.6.1997. The Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.714 of 1997 before the Appellate Division was also dismissed.<br/><br/>20. In a pre-emption case, predominantly the question is whether the pre-emptor is a co-sharer in the case land.<br/><br/>21. In the trial Court, the learned Judge, did not frame any such issue and naturally did not decide the said question. Naturally this issue was not agitated before any of the Courts in appeal or revision or even before this Division in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 714 of 1997.<br/><br/>22. Under such circumstances, the trial Court in the pre-emption miscellaneous case framed issues, among others, as to whether the pre-emptor is a co-sharer in the Khatian. On consideration of the evi­dence on record he answered the said issue in the negative.<br/><br/>23. Since the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division correctly found that the predecessor of the pre-emptor petition­er separated her <em>jama</em> as far back as in 1987 and paid ground rent on the basis of the said mutation Miscellaneous Case, the contention raised by Mr. T. H. Khan has got no substance. Obviously, the Pre-emp­tor petitioner was not a co-sharer in the case-land.<br/><br/>24. The learned Judge of the High Court Division rightly set aside the judgment and order passed by the appellate Court and restored that of the Trial Court.<br/>Under such circumstances, this appeal is dismissed but without any order as to cost.<br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
