Facts as revealed in the leave petition, in short, are that the plaintiffs filed Title Suit No.421 of 1975 in the 2nd Court of the learned Assistant Judge, Satkhira for dec­laration of title to the suit properly and per­manent injunction against the defendant respondent Nos. 1 to 3 stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the declaration of the property as enemy property is illegal, void and not binding upon them and that the suit prop­erty belonged to Balai Sardar and others to the extent of 2 annas share each, Nilambar and Bhupan Charan had 4 annas share each and that there being no embankment in the area where the suit land is situated the recorded tenants failed to produce any crops and as such could not pay rent to the landlord and that except Bhupati Charan, predecessor of the plaintiff Nos.1-2 and other tenants surrendered their right in favour of the landlord in 1351 B.S. and Bhupati Charan took settlement of their share in 1352 B.S. and was in possession of the suit property through cultivation but the suit property was wrongly recorded in the name of Genoda Sundari Ghosh and there being a certificate case Bhupati Charan cleared the dues and that he filed Title Suit No.303 of 1997 against the wrong records of rights and that the suit was decreed on 07.06.1972 and Bhupati Charan died leaving plaintiffs as heirs and they have been in possession of the proper­ty and that the plaintiffs' father died just after obtaining the decree in Title Suit No. 303 of 1997 and as such could not cor­rect the mutation and the tashilder of the respondent No.1 (Government) being encouraged by the wrong record of right got the suit property enlisted as enemy property and taking advantage of wrong enlistment of the property as enemy prop­erty, the plaintiffs have been threatened to be dispossessed and as such the plaintiffs felt constrained to file the suit.<br/><br/>3. The suit was contested by the respon­dent Nos. 2 and 3 denying the material averments made in the plaint and stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit property has been correctly enlisted as vested property.<br/><br/>4. The learned Assistant Judge after hearing the parties decreed the suit in part by the judgment and order dated 23.11.1985.<br/><br/>5. The defendants preferred Title Appeal No.12 of 1986 and the learned Additional District Judge, 1st Court, Satkhira remand­ed the suit for trial afresh by the learned Assistant Judge and directed the plaintiff to implead the Government of Bangladesh as the defendant in the suit. During pen­dency of the suit one Md. Nur Islam and seven others filed an application dated 02.08.1993 in the Court of the learned Assistant Judge, Satkhira under Order 1 Rule, 10 and Order 22 Rule 10 read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure to implead them as defendants in the suit claiming themselves to be purchasers of the suit property through deeds of sale dated 16th March 1991. The learned Assistant Judge by order dated 17.08.1993 allowed their application and impleaded them as the defendants in the suit after hearing both the parties. The plaintiff peti­tioners being aggrieved by the order of the learned Assistant Judge allowing the appli­cation for adding the aforesaid applicants as the defendants filed an application under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure to review the aforesaid order dated 17.08.1993.<br/>6. The learned Assistant Judge by order dated 02.10.1993 rejected the application.<br/><br/>7. Being aggrieved the plaintiff petitioners moved the High Court Division under Section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure in Civil Revision No.3102 of 1993. A learned Single Judge of the High Court Division by the impugned judgment and order discharged the rule.<br/><br/>8. Hence is this petition.<br/><br/>9. Mr. Bivash Chandra Biswas, learned Advocate-on-Record appearing in support of the petition submits, <em>inter alia</em>, that the respondent Nos.4 to 11 the added defen­dants having no interest in the suit land cannot be impleaded as defendants in the suit and that the suit being filed against the Government for declaring the enlistment of the suit property as enemy property the aforesaid added defendants have no <em>locus standi</em> to be impleaded as the defendants and that the High Court Division commit­ted error in disregarding this broad aspect of case and as such the impugned judg­ment calls for interference.<br/><br/>10. We have considered the submissions and perused the materials on record.<br/><br/>11. We have also perused the application of the respondent Nos. 4 to 11, the added defendants dated 02.08.1993.<br/><br/>12. It appears that in the aforesaid applica­tion they in detail narrated the basis of their claim in the suit property. They stated that through registered deeds of sale dated 16.03.1991 they purchased the suit proper­ty from the owners and as such it cannot be said that they are not interested in the result of the suit. If it is felt necessary for deter­mination of the real matter in the dispute the court may decide any person to be added as party in a suit and this is in fact a discretionary power of the court. The dis­cretion is, however, to be exercised judi­cially. After perusing the application of the added respondent Nos. 4 to 11 dated 02.08.1993 for adding them as defendants, it appears to us that they succeeded to make out a case deserving them to be impleaded in the suit as defendants.<br/><br/>13. The learned Assistant Judge, therefore, appears to have exercised the discretion judicially by entertaining their application and allowing the same.<br/><br/>14. In such view of the matter we are of the view that the order passed by the learned Assistant Judge does not suffer from any illegality.<br/><br/>15. We have perused the judgment and order of the High Court Division. The learned Single Judge considered the facts and circumstances and came to a correct decision in discharging the rule.<br/>In this view of the matter we do not find any substance in this petition<br/><br/>The petition is accordingly dismissed.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
