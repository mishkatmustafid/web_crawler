Nawab Ali, Advocate-on-Record - For the Petitioner.</em><br/><em>Khan Saifur Rahman, Advocate instructed by Sharifuddin Chaklader, Advocate on Record </em>- <em>For the Respondent.</em><br/><br/><strong>Civil Appeal No. 55 of 1995.</strong><br/>(From the Judgment and Order dated 12-2-1993 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 1346 of 1993).<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Judgment</strong></span><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mohammad Abdur Rouf J.- </strong>This appeal by leave by the plaintiff appellant is from the judgment and order dated 12.2.95 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 1346 of 1993 reversing the judgment and decree passed by the learned Assistant Judge, Narayanganj, as the S.C.C. Judge on 22.4.93 decreeing S.C.C. suit No. 1 of 1987.<br/><br/>2. The appellant brought the suit for evic­tion of her monthly  tenant,  the defendant respondent, from the suit premises stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the defendant is a habitual defaulter and he had caused serious damages to the suit premises by making illegal changes in the struc­tures without her consent, that the suit premises is required for her personal use and occupation to prove her sons therein, that she had served notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act terminating the tenancy and the defendant received the same on 14-10-84 but did not vacate the suit premises on the expiry of the month Chaitra 1391 B.S.<br/><br/>3. The defendant respondent contested the suit by filing written statement denying that he was a defaulter and that the premises was required for personal use and occupation of the plaintiff. He also denied the receipt of notice under section 106 of the transfer of Property Act. His further case is that the plaintiff with a bad motive had refused to accept the rent for the month of Baishak, 1389 B.S. and since thereafter he started depositing rent in the court of House Rent Controller in House Rent Control Case No. 55 of 1982, but due to inadvertance he had failed to deposit the money-order fees along with the monthly rent as such the House Rent Control Case was dismissed on 26-1-82. Against which he unsuccessfully moved upto the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court.<br/><br/>4. The learned S.C.C. Judge decree the suit on 22-4-93. But the High Court Division by the impugned judgement and order dated 12-2-1995 passed under section 25 of Small Causes Court Act in Civil Revision No. 1346 of 1993, preferred by the defendant, reversed the decree and dismissed the suit.<br/><br/>5. Leave was granted to consider as to whether the learned Judge of the High Court Division wrongly held that  the learned S.C.C Judge had illegally shifted the onus of proof of service of notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act upon the defendant and acted illegally having entertained the S.C.C suit and that whether learned S.C.C Judge also decreed the suit in violation of the principles of law laid down in the case of <strong><em>Abdus Sattar and others vs. Suresh Chandra Das and others, 32 DLR (AD) 170.</em></strong><br/><br/>6. Mr. Nawab Ali, learned Advocate-on-Record appearing in support of the appeal sub­mitted that the trial Court on consideration of the evidence on record decreed the suit holding, <em>inter alia</em>, that the defendant was monthly tenant under the appellant and that he without the con­sent of the plaintiff illegally and forcibly made substantial changes in the structures of the suit premises causing damages thereto and that a notice under section 106 T.P. Act was duly served upon the defendant terminating the ten­ancy. But the learned Judge of the High Court Division without reversing those findings of fact of the trial Court wrongly reversed the decree and dismissed the suit holding that the trial Court had illegally shifted the burden of proof of service of notice of termination of the tenancy upon the defendant which resulted in an error in the decision of the suit. Mr. Nawab Ali further submitted that notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act was served upon the defendant by registered post with acknowledgement due and the plaintiff also proved the service of notice Ext. 6, postal receipt Ext.5, acknowledgement receipt ext. 5A and the said notice was received on behalf of the defendant by Sheikh Amjad Hossain, the younger brother of the defendant on 14-10-84 and as such the legal presumption of due service of notice is in favour of the plaintiff, but the learned Judge of the High Court Division erred in holding that the trial Court had illegally shift­ed the onus of proof of service of notice upon the defendant.<br/><br/>7. Mr. Khan Saifur Rahman, learned Advocate appearing for the defendant-respondent, on the other hand, in support of the judg­ment and order of the High Court Division submitted that service of proper notice under sec­tion 106 of the Transfer of Property Act termi­nating the tenancy confers jurisdiction upon the S.C.C. Court to entertain the suit for ejectment of tenant from the suit premises, and that the plaintiff having failed to prove the legal service of such notice upon the defendant, the learned S.C.C. Judge wrongly decreed the suit on the weakness of the defence case that the defendant did not examine Mosharaf Hossain, who hap­pened to be his younger brother and allegedly had received the said notice on his behalf on 10-8-84, to disprove such service of notice. The learned Advocate further submitted that the trial Court having decreed the suit entirely upon wrong premises and contrary to well-settled principles of law that the plaintiff is to prove his case the learned Judge of the High Court Division was justified in exercise of his author­ity under section 25 of the S.C.C. Act to reverse the dei.ree of the trial Court upon the finding that the plaintiff could not prove his case of due service of notice of termination of the tenancy in question.<br/><br/>8. The trial Court on consideration of both oral and documentary evidence decreed the suit holding, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit premises had been let out for manufacturing purposes (manu­facturing hosiery goods) and the defendant had caused damages to the building by bringing unauthorised changes in the structures of the suit premises and that the plaintiff duly termi­nated the tenancy by serving notice upon the defendant under section 106 of T.P. Act.<br/><br/>9. As regards the termination of the tenancy upon service of notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, the trial Court besides the oral evidence of P.Ws. 1 and 2 relied upon the notice itself ext. 6, postal receipt ext. 5 and acknowledgment receipt ext. 5A and ultimate­ly held that tenancy in question having been for manufacturing purposes six months notice for its termination dated 13-10-84 corresponding to 26th Aswin, 1391 B.S. (Ext. 6) was duly served upon the defendant and thereby the tenancy was legally terminated by the end of that Bengali year. In arriving at such findings the trial court also noticed that Mosharraf Hossain on 14.10.84 had received the notice on behalf of the defendant and that the defendant as D.W. 1 in cross examination admitted that Mosharraf Hossain is his younger brother and after seeing the signature on the postal acknowledgment receipt Ext. 5A, he did not directly deny that signature to be of his said brother. The learned Judge of the High Court Division without reversing those findings of the trial court held that the trial court had illegally shifted the bur­den of proof of service of notice (Ext. 6) upon the defendant which resulted in an error in his decision in the suit in as much as, according him, in the absence of legal service of notice under section 106 T.P. Act the very suit for ejectment was not entertainable by the trial court.<br/><br/>10. The learned Judge of the High Court Division clearly fell into an error in holding that the trial court had wrongly shifted the burden of proof of service of notice upon the defendant although the trial court on consideration of the both oral and documentary evidence, men­tioned earlier, held that the tenancy in question had stood terminated on the expiry of chaitra, 1391 B.S. upon due service of notice under sec­tion 106 T. P. Act. Moreover in view of the evi­dence of P. Ws. 1 and 2 and the documents like postal receipts Ext. 5 and 5A there was legal presumption of due service of notice in question upon the defendant and as such the trial court rightly observed that the defendant did not rebut such legal presumption of due service of notice examining his brother Mosharraf Hussain.<br/><br/>11. The trial court decreed the suit holding that the defendant by making unauthorised changes in the structures of the suit premises rendered himself ejectable therefrom. The High Court Division did not at all reverse such find­ing of fact in reversing the decree of the trial court.<br/><br/>12. On the clear finding of fact arrived at by the trial court that the notice under section 106 T.P. Act had duly been served upon the defen­dant and the tenancy thereby had legally stood terminated on the expiry of Chaitra 1391 B.S. the question of violation of the decision, in <strong><em>Abdus Sattar and others vs. Suresh Chandra Das and others</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>32 DLR (AD) 170</em></strong>, by the trial court does not arise inasmuch as the principles decided there are not relevant for the present purpose.<br/>The appeal is, therefore, allowed with costs. The impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division are set aside and the judg­ment and decree of the trial court are restored.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
