So we cannot agree that the plaintiff Deity had rent receiving interest in the suit property. The High Court Division also rightly found that the suit land of C.S. Khatian No.458 comprising plot Nos.151 and 153 has been recorded as Brahmatra under C.S. Khatian No.456 and as a Shebait Hari Priya Baisnabi was in possession. It also appears that the High Court Division also found that there are no people showing that Khepa Chand Bairagi took jot pattan of the suit property in the year of 1951 but there is no paper that the property was vested in the Government and the Government gave pattan to Khepa Chand Bairagi. Once the suit property is vested in the Deity it can­not be divested and the Debuttar Property under Section 415 of the Hindu Law is inalienable.                                                                                                                                                                           ….

When, however, the shebait is negligent or is himself the guilty party against whom the deity needs relief, it is open to worshipper or other persons interested in the endowment to file suits for the protection of the debuttar. It is open to the deity also to file a suit through some person as the next friend for recovery of or for other relief.

No. 54 of 1999)<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Judgment</strong></span><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Md. Muzammel Hossain J</strong>. - This appeal by leave is directed against the judgment and order dated 26.07.2004 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division In F. A. No. 54 of 1999 affirming those dated 28.10.1998 passed by the learned Sub-Ordinate Judge, 4th Court, Dhaka in Title Suit No.102 of 1992 Decreeing the suit.<br/><br/>2. Facts involved in this case, in short, are that the plaintiffs-respondents instituted suit being Title Suit No.102 of 1992 in the Court of Sub-Ordinate Judge, 4th Court, Dhaka praying for declaration that the "Ka" schedule property as Debuttar Property and the registered deed dated 13.01.1977 as described in the "Kha" schedule is illegal, collusive, null and void impleading the appellants as principal defendants.<br/><br/>3. The case of the plaintiff-appellants, in short, are that the suit property measuring .71 acres of land appertaining to three plots in C.S. Khatian Nos.456 and 458 of Mouza Gopar, Police Station Keranigonj, District-Dhaka as morefully described in the sched­ule to the plaint was correctly recorded in the name of the Deity Sree Sree Gopal Jew Bigraha and Hari Priya Baisnabi was its <em>shebait </em>and accordingly the impugned C.S. Khatians were prepared and finally pub­lished in the name of Deity. Hari Priya Baisnabi alias Dukhi Baisnabi as the Shebait of the deity constructed homestead in the suit land to perform the religious rites of the Bigraha. On the death of Hari Priya Baisnabi the religious minded per­sons requested the predecessors of the respondents Khapa Chand Bairagi to per­form the religious rites of the deity. Accordingly Khapa Chand Bairagi per­formed the religious rites of the Deity residing right in the suit property. The S.A. Khatian was prepared in the name of the defendant-appellant and finally published; that the local people were not aware about the wrong recording of S.A. Khatian. So they could not file any objection; that in 1970 the local people filed a Miscellaneous Case under Section 143A of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act for correction of the S.A. Khatian in the Court of the Munsif, 3rd Court, Dhaka (now Assistant Judge) against Khepa Chand Bairagi which was subsequently dismissed for non-prose­cution; that after the death of Khepa Chand Bairagi his two sons did not create any hin­drance in the performance of the religious rites of the Deity; that the local people came to know that the sons of Khepa Chand Bairagi are trying to dispose of the suit property and as such on 03.05.1985 local religious minded people formed a committee to run the religious rites of the Deity; that in 1987 one Kebel Chandra Sarker, General Secretary of the Committee filed a petition before the Circle Officer (Revenue), Keraniganj for correcting the S.A. Khatian in the name of the Deity and on that petition Mutation Case No. 1002/87-88 dated 28.10.1987 was started and the S.A. record was corrected by mutating the suit property in the name of the Deity. But the defendant-appellants raised an objection for cancellation of the said mutation case before the Assistant Commissioner (Land), Keraniganj claim­ing their title in the suit property and that Mutation Case No.1052/84-85 was restored; that subsequently all the mutation cases were disposed of in favour of the defendant-appellants.<br/><br/>4. The defendant-appellants contested the suit by filing written statement denying all the material allegations made by the plain­tiffs-respondents contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit property measuring 35 deci­mals of land was recorded in the name of the Deity Sree Sree Gopal Jew Bigraha as a rent receiver and one Hari Priya Baisnabi as its Shebait, possessed the same as rent free tenant and .35 acres of land in plot Nos.151 and 153 under C.S. Khatian No.458 was recorded in the name of Kunju Bihari Mondal; that Hari Priya Baisnabi used to reside in the suit land; As she became old and was unable to move she brought Khepa Chand Bairagi to reside in the suit property who used to deal with harbal medicine and that in 1948 Hari Priya Bisnabi died and after her death her only heir Khepa Chand Bairagi inherited the suit property and possessed the same along with the members of his fami­ly running harbal medicine business there­in; that prior to that there was no Deity in the suit property and the C.S. recorded bargader also did not possess the same; that after whole sale acquisition the suit property vested in the Government and thereafter in 1951 Khepa Chand Bairagi took pattan of the suit land in his name correctly and possessed the same as his own property; that he never performed any religious rites of the Deity; that on 31.01.1977 Khepa Chand Bairagi trans­ferred the suit property by deed of gift in favour of his two sons and wife-defendant appellants and mutated their names vide Mutation Case No. 1052/84-85 dated 26.11.1984 and paid rent to the Government; that on 03.01.1990 these defendant-appellants came to know that their mutation case has been cancelled and the Khatian has been restored; that the plaintiff-respondents filed Review Case No.76/90-91 against which the defendant-appellants filed Miscellaneous Case No.28 of 1992 before the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) and the mutation cases were restored; that the plaintiff-respondents preferred appeal which was disallowed on 04.04.1993; that the plaintiff-respondents in collusion with some local notorious persons forcibly dis­possessed the defendant-appellants from 5'X6' yards of land of the suit property and that they installed a Deity there but in fact in the suit property there was never any Deity; that the suit property is the paternal property of the defendant-appellants.<br/><br/>5. The suit was decreed by the learned Sub-Ordinate Judge, 4th Court, Dhaka on 28.10.1998. Being aggrieved by and dis­satisfied with the judgment and degree dated 28.10.1998 (Decree signed on 08.11.1998) passed by the learned Sub­ordinate Judge, 4th Court, Dhaka the defendant-appellant preferred First Appeal No.54 of 1999 before the High Court Division and a Division Bench of the High Court Division by the impugned Judgment and decree dated 26.07.2004 dismissed the first appeal and affirmed those passed by the learned Sub-Ordinate Judge, 4th Court, Dhaka.<br/><br/>6. The defendant-appellants as petitioners being aggrieved by the impugned judg­ment and decree dated 26.07.2004 passed by the High Court Division preferred Civil Petition For Leave To Appeal No. 1476 of 2004 before the Appellate Division.<br/><br/>7. Leave was granted to consider the sub­missions that the right to a decree to a plaintiff in a suit for declaration arises only when he is within limitation pre­scribed for the purpose in the Limitation Act and that the instant suit being for a declaration of title on cancellation of the document for transfer of the property in the suit and in the circumstances of the case the provision of Article 92 of the Limitation Act is applicable in the case and the cause of action arose from the date of definite knowledge of the plaintiff in respect of the impugned document being available to him in 1962 and he filed the case for correction of the record of right already being prepared in the name of the transferee defendant petitioner but the suit filed on 20.06.1992 is obviously barred by limitation. The learned Counsel further submitted that the gift by Shabait to the defendant Nos.1 and 2 being to persons in line of succession to the office of Shebait being valid in law, the Courts below com­mitted illegality in declaring the said gift Ext.Cha, executed on 13.01.1977 to be void holding the same to be a <em>Kabala</em> and the instant suit having been filed on 20.06.1992 which on its face is barred by law of limitation.<br/><br/>8. Fazlul Karim, Senior Advocate with N. K. Saha, Senior Advocate, instruct­ed by Md. Nawab Ali, Advocate-on-Record appearing for the appellants sub­mits that the High Court Division most illegally passed the impugned judgment and decree dismissing the appeal without considering that the suit is barred by limi­tation. He then submits that the learned Judges of the High Court Division without any valid reason opined that the alleged registered deed of gift was not a valid deed of gift admitting that the defendant-appel­lants have been possessing the suit land as their own property for more than 12 years. He then submits that the S.A. Khatian and R.S. Khatian were recorded in the name of the appellant's father and Khepa Chand Bairagi by a registered deed of gift trans­ferred the suit property on 13.01.1977 in favour of his widow and two sons. He finally submits that present appellants have possessed the suit land on pay­ment of rent to the Government Sheresta and as such the impugned judgment and decree passed by the High Court Division is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>9. Herandra Nath Nandi, Advocate instructed by Syed Mahbubur Rahman, Advocate-On-Record, appearing on behalf of the respondents submits that the suit property being a Debuttar Property and the appellants being not owners, Shebaits or next friend of the Deity have got no <em>locus standi</em> to contest the suit and prefer the appeal as they have no right, title and interest and possession in the suit land. He then submits that having regard to the facts that the C. S. Khatians were correctly prepared and published in the name of deity Sree Sree Gopal Jew Bigraha and Hari Priya Baisnabi as the Shebait and the said property belonged to Niskar Brahmmatra and completely dedi­cated to the plaintiff deity; that wrong recording of S.A. Khatian and R.S. Khatian in the name of the defendant-appellants should not cover any title to the suit property upon them and admittedly the defendant-appellant failed to show any papers showing that the suit property was vested in Government and the Government gave pattan to Khepa Chand Bairagi. He then submits that the High Court Division as a Court of Appeal right­ly found that once the Debuttar Property is vested to the alter of Deity it cannot be divested and the suit property in the pres­ent case was rightly recorded and dedicat­ed in the name of Deity Sree Sree Gopal Jew Bigraha. Nandi, the learned Advocate for the respondent finally sub­mits that the 'Ka' schedule property is Debuttar Property as Vested upon the Deity and transfer of the said property by the alleged registered deed in favour of the appellants are collusive, illegal and null and void and as such the question of limi­tation does not arise and the suit was filed very much within the period of limitation.<br/><br/>10. From the careful perusal of the impugned judgment and decree passed by the High Court Division it appears that the High Court Division found that C. S. Khatian No.456 was rightly recorded in the name of Hari Priya Baisnabi as Shebait and the Deity Sree Sree Gopal Jew Bigraha was the raiyat. So we cannot agree that the plaintiff Deity had rent receiving interest in the suit property. The High Court Division also rightly found that the suit land of C.S. Khatian No.458 comprising plot Nos.151 and 153 has been recorded as Brahmatra under C.S. Khatian No.456 and as a Shebait Hari Priya Baisnabi was in possession. It also appears that the High Court Division also found that there are no people showing that Khepa Chand Bairagi took jot pattan of the suit property in the year of 1951 but there is no paper that the property was vested in the Government and the Government gave pattan to Khepa Chand Bairagi. Once the suit property is vested in the Deity it can­not be divested and the Debuttar Property under Section 415 of the Hindu Law is inalienable. The Shebait can reside for the purpose of performing religious rites and for the benefit and preservation for the Debuttar Property. The learned Judge of the High Court Division rightly found that the deed of gift created by Khepa Chand Bairagi in favour of the defendants is void <em><img src="file:///C:/Users/Anik/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.gif" style="height:16px; width:16px"/>ab initio</em>. It is well established by the Supreme Court that as a general rule of Hindu Law property given for the mainte­nance of religious worship is inalienable. In the case of <em><strong>Hunooman Persaud Vs. Mst. Babooee </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> 1856-6-MIA 393</strong></em> it has been held that Shebayet has no power to alienate the Debuttar Property except in a case of need or for the benefit of the estate. He is not entitled to sell the property for investing the price of it to bring in an income larger than that derived from the property itself.<br/><br/>11. In the case of <em><strong>Bishnath and another v. Sri Thakur Radha Ballabhji and others </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> AIR 1967 (S.C.) 1045</strong></em> it has been held that a suit filed by an idol for declaration of its title and possession of property from a person who is in posses­sion thereof under a void alienation, being only in the nature of enforcement of a pri­vate right by the idol and not being for any one of the reliefs found in Section 92 of the Code of Civil Procedure, falls outside its purview and is not barred. It has further been held that when such an alienation has been effected by the shebait acting adversely to the interests of the idol, even a worshipper can file the suit, the reason being that the idol is in the position of a minor and when the person representing it leaves it in a lurch, a person interested in the worship of the idol can certainly be clothed with an hoc power of representa­tion to protect its interest.<br/><br/>12. In the case of <em><strong>Pradip Kumar Chakraborty Vs. Jamila Khatun Bibi &amp; ors reported in 51 DLR (AD) 156</strong></em> the Appellate Division while referring to the decision of the case of <em><strong>Kishore Joo Vs. Guman Behari Joo Deo AIR 1978 All 1 </strong></em>wherein it has been held that "in excep­tional circumstances persons other than a Shebait can institute a suit on behalf of an idol." has quoted with approval the fol­lowing except of BK Mukherjea's book on "The Hindu Law of Religious and Charitable Trust":<br/>"The deity as a juristic person has undoubtedly the right to institute a suit for the protection of its interest. So long as there is a shebait in office, functioning properly, the rights of the deity, as stated above, practically lie dormant and it is the shebait alone who can file suits in the interest of the deity. When, however, the shebait is negligent or is himself the guilty party against whom the deity needs relief, it is open to worshipper or other persons interested in the endowment to file suits for the protection of the debuttar. It is open to the deity also to file a suit through some person as the next friend for recovery of or for other relief. Such a next friend may not often be a person who as a prospec­tive shebait or a worshipper is person­ally interested in the endowment".<br/><br/>13. Accordingly the Appellate Division in the aforesaid decision held that a <em>pujari </em>and a worshipper of the deity who has offered himself to act as next friend of the Deity can by no means be precluded from representing the Deity.<br/><br/>14. In the case of <em><strong>Abdul Hafez and anoth­er Vs. Lai Meah </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> 8 BLD (HCD) 497</strong></em> it has been held that if there is an entry adverse to the plaintiff he is not bound to institute suit for declaration that the entry is wrong. Such a suit will be in time if brought within 6 years of the threatened invasion. In the instant case it appears that the appellant Khepa Chand Bairagi when transferred the property the plaintiff-respondents filed the suit seeking appro­priate relief as stated above. In the case of <em><strong>Chunnu Mia Vs. Manindra Lai Roy and others </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> 39 DLR (AD) 42</strong></em> it has been held that a permanent lease or absolute alienation of debuttar property is beyond ordinary powers of management whether in the case of the head of a math, the shebait of a family idol or the dharmakarta of a temple, such alienation can be justified only by proof of necessity for the preservation of the endowment or institution.<br/><br/>15. In the instant case admittedly the suit property was recorded in the C.S. Khatian as Debuttar Property in the name of Sree Sree Gopal Jew Bigraha and Hari Priya Baisnabi. After the death of Hari Priya Baisnabi, Khepa Chand Bairagi was inducted in the suit property as Shebait and residing for the purpose of performing religious rites. Both the Courts below made concurrent findings that the defen­dant failed to show any document that the suit property was vested in the Government and then the Government gave pattan of the suit property in favour of Khepa Chand Bairagi in 1951. Rather it has been proved by the plaintiff-respon­dent that Khepa chand Bairagi was induct­ed in the suit property as shebait to per­form religious rites of the Deity. A shebait does not acquire any title to the Debuttar Property. The Debuttar Property can not be alienated by him except in case of unavoidable necessity. There is no deny­ing the fact that the shebait can reside in the suit property for the purpose for per­forming religious rites. It does not create any title in his favour so Khepa Chand Bairagi was not legally entitled to transfer the suit property by a deed of gift in favour of the defendants-appellants. Accordingly both the Courts below rightly found that the said deed of gift is illegal and <em>void</em> <em>ab initio</em>. We are of the view that mere record­ing of some ones name in the S.A. or R.S. Khatian does not create any title to the property. In the instant case the General Secretary of the Committee on behalf of the Deity has filed the suit in respect of the Debuttar Property, which is very much supported by the decision of the Indian Supreme Court reported in <em><strong>AIR 1967(SC) 1044</strong></em> and the decisions of this Apex Court reported in <em><strong>39 DLR (AD) 42 </strong></em>and<em><strong> 51 DLR (AD) 156.</strong></em><br/><br/>16. It appears that the High Court Division while dismissing the appeal found that the trial Court rightly held that the suit prop­erty having been vested in the Deity Sree Sree Gopal Jew Bigraha became debutter property and Khepa Chan Bairagi having been inducted in the suit property as Shebait cannot alienate the said debutter property to the defendants-appellants; that the defendants-appellants being the heirs of the Shebait, Khepa Chan Bairagi, have the right of performing the religious rites of the Deity as Shebait and are entitled to retain their possession by performing the duties of the Shebait but they are not enti­tled to transfer the said debuttar property.<br/><br/>17. In the facts and circumstances of the case and in view of the discussions made above we are of the view that the High Court Division by the impugned judgment and decree rightly affirmed those passed by the learned Sub-Ordinate Judge and there is no illegality in the impugned judg­ment and decree passed by the High Court Division which does not call for any inter­ference by this Court.<br/>18. In the result, the appeal is dismissed without any order as to cost. The impugned judgment and decree dated 26.07.2004 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in F. A. No. 54 of 1999 is hereby affirmed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
