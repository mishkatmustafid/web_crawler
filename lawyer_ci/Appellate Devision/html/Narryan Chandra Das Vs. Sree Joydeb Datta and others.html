Nawab Ali, Advocate-on-Record- For the Petitioner.</em><br/><em>Not represented-Respondent.</em><br/><br/><strong>Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.753 of 2006.</strong><br/>(From the judgment and decree dated 25.10.2005 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 1120 of 1995.)<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Judgment</strong></span><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Md. Abdul Matin J.-</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and decree dated 25.10.2005 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 1120 of 1995 discharging the Rule reversing the judgment and decree dated 28.08.1994 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, 3rd Court, Khulna in Title Appeal No. 155 of 1988 allowing the appeal reversing the judgment and decree dated 30.05.1988 passed by the learned Assistant Judge, Phultala, District-Khulna in Title Suit No.21 of 1985.<br/><br/>2. The facts, in short, are that the respon­dent Nos.1 and 2 as plaintiffs filed title suit on 30.05.1985 being No. 21 of 1985 in the Court of Assistant Judge, Phultala for declaration that the auction dated 04.01.1983 in the certificate Case No.90/81-82 held by the then C.O. Revenue, Daulatpur Circle, Phultala, is collusive, fraudulent, illegal, void and not binding upon plaintiff stating<em>, inter alia</em>, that the property measuring an area of 1.14 acres of recorded in S.A. Khatian No. 168 within mouza Paikgram Kasba, Thana-Phultala, District-Khulna original­ly belonged to and held by Gurudas Datta, Girish Chandra Datta alias Kanailal Datta and Sirish Chandra Datta. Aforesaid Gurudas Datta and Sirish Chandra Datta died leaving their full brother Girish Chandra Datta as legal heir who mutated his name in 16 annas share vide Misc. Case No.879 of 1982-83 and thereafter he paid rents to the Government and while in possession transferred .24 decimals of land of plot No.518 to plaintiff No.2 by registered kabala dated 30.04.1984 and delivered possession in his favour and since then the plaintiff No.2 has been pos­sessing the same on payment of rent through plaintiff No.1. The balance .90 acres of suit jama and other land was transferred by said Girish Chandra Datta to his son plaintiff No.1 through a registered deed of gift dated 03.05.1984 and possession was delivered and plaintiff No.1 constructed homestead there and pan baraj in a portion of suit land. The plaintiffs father gave oral lease of .32 acres of land of Plot No.654 to the defendant No.1 since 8/9 years back for creation of pan baraj there and present plaintiff also renewed the said lease; the defendant No.1 for illegal gain to grab the suit land managed to put the suit land in auction in collusion with the staffs of the office of defendant No.2 although the plaintiff or his father never defaulted in paying rent and the defendant No.2 in collusion with defendant No.1 illegally started certificate case and no notice under Section 7 was issued either in the name of plaintiffs or their predecessor and secretly auction sold the suit land at Tk.115/-only but actual market value of the land will be Tk.25,000/- and possession was not deliv­ered to the auction purchaser and they threatened on 6th Jaistha 1392 B.S. to dis­possess the plaintiff from the suit land by disclosing auction purchase and thereafter the plaintiffs filed the present suit.<br/><br/>3. The defendant No.1 appeared and con­tested the suit by filing a written statement contending, <em>inter-alia</em>, that the plaintiffs have no <em>locus standi</em> to institute the suit and the suit is not maintainable in its pres­ent from and the suit is bad for defect of parties and in suit khatian Guru Das Datta had 7 annas 10 gondas, Girish Chandra had 1 anna share and Sirish Chandra had 7 annas 10 gondas share and .90 acres of land Plot No.574/575/654/659 and 654/946 the defendant No.1 took oral lease since 1968 from Gurudas Datta for a term of 10 years on payment Tk.200/- as yearly selami and the defendant No.1 got possession of the said land by way of aforesaid lease and since then the defen­dant No.1 made 1 pan baraj in the vacant portion and planted fruit bearing trees i.e. mango, jack fruit, bel, coconut, banana etc. and has been possessing by enjoying usufructs and after expiry of lease period again defendant No.1 took oral lease on payment of Tk.400/- as yearly selemi money from the heirs of aforesaid owners' the owner Gurudas Datta is still alive and living in India and Sirish Datta died leav­ing 5 sons namely Amaresh Datta, Shamshor Datta, Aparesh Datta, Kumaresh Datta and Ajit Datta and all of them have been residing at village-Madhamgram within India and father of plaintiff No.1 with his elder two brothers namely Subash Datta and another also are residing within said village in India and before their departure from this country rent was due for which certificate case being No.90/81-82 was started and after service of notice the suit property was put in auction and it was sold on 04.01.1983 and the defendant No.1 purchased the suit land in auction and said auction was con­firmed on 06.03.1983 and delivery of pos­session was made through court by beat of drum on 11.04.1983 and the defendant No.1 mutated his name vide Misc. Case No.1338/1982-83 and since then the defendant No.1 has been possession the suit land and Girish Chandra Datta had no right, title and when certificate proceeding was started the father of plaintiff No.1 sold his 1 anna share measuring an area of .08 acres to Narendranath Das, son of late Natabar Das of Village Dakshin Dihi by a kabala dated 1982-83 and when he came to take possession he found that the defen­dant No.1 has been possessing entire land on the basis of auction sale. Thereafter he never came to take possession and after auction sale Girish Chandra also left for India and permanently resides there and the plaintiffs in collusion with each other created forged kabala and deed of gift in the name of said Girish Chandra and Gurudas Datta who are still alive and he has a daughter namely Shibu Rani who has been living at village-Abhoy Nagar, within Jessore District and she had sons and in that view of the matter the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>4. The learned Assistant Judge dismissed the suit and on appeal the appellate court allowed the appeal, set aside the judgment and decree and sent the suit back on remand.<br/><br/>5. As against the judgment and order of remand Civil Revision No.1120 of 1995 was filed before the High Court Division and by the impugned judgment and order the High Court Division discharged the Rule with modification that the suit is decreed in favour of the plaintiff and the Certificate Case No.90 of 1981-82 and the auction sale held therein on 04.01.1983 was declared as illegal and not binding upon the plaintiffs and directed to the defendant Nos. 2 and 3 to restore the pos­session of the suit land to the plaintiff within 1(one) month from the date of the receipt of the copy of the judgment. The defendant No.1 was also directed to pay rent to the plaintiffs for the years 1381 B.S. till restoration of the possession to the plaintiffs at the rate of Tk.400/-per year and the petitioner was directed to pay cost of Tk.20,000/-.<br/><br/>6. We have heard the learned Advocate and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/><br/>7. The learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that the High Court Division is not justified in decreeing the suit without sending back the case either to the appel­late court or to the trial court inasmuch as the present revision case has been filed by the defendants against the remand order of the appellate court and in that view of the matter the impugned judgment is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>8. It appears that admittedly the plaintiffs are owners of the suit land and the defendants claim to be borgadars under the plaintiffs. The High Court Division right­ly held that the auction sale was collusive one at a nominal price of Tk. 150/- and the present petitioner being borgadars under the plaintiff cheated his landlord, the plaintiff. But the High Court Division should not have penalized the defendant by saddling him with a cost of Tk. 20,000/- .<br/><br/>9. We find no merit in this petition. However for ends of justice we are exon­erating the petitioner from the liability of cost of Tk. 20,000/- as directed by the High Court Division.<br/>With this modification as to cost this petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
