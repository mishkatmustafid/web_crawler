Short facts as placed before the High Court Division are that the suit building a four storied building situated at 27, Agrabad Commercial Area, known as "Mercantile Court" belonging to a non Bengali vested in the Government of Bangladesh as abandoned property and the said building was occupied by different tenants including the plaintiff. The Government of Bangladesh under its power of management of abandoned properties, published auction notice for sale of the same "Mercantile Court" and the plaintiff appellant-petitioner being in need of more space for accommodation participated in the auction and became the highest bidder, so it was accepted by the Government of Bangladesh and eventually executed sale deed No. 338 dated 8.6.1990 in favour of the plaintiff. The Government evicted some occu­pants by way of eviction and handed over the same to the plaintiff. The defen­dant Nos.1-2 were in occupation of two rooms on the second floor of the said building, one measuring 148.28 square feet and the other measuring 1328.30 square feet and the Government by serv­ing notice through Memo No. 4028(16)/S.A. dated 4.12.1985 had ter­minated the tenancy of the defendants and directed them to hand over vacant possession of the said two rooms to the plaintiff petitioner but the defendants did not comply with the said order of the Government on the plea of pendency of their suit in the Court. The defendant Nos.1 and 2 entered appearance in the said suit but did not file any written statement in that suit.<br/><br/>3. After purchasing the building the plaintiff also served notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act and thereafter filed a suit being No. 141 of 1992 for eviction.<br/><br/>4. At that time of filing the case the learned Advocate for the petitioner inad­vertently showed three rooms in the schedule of the plaint and eviction was sought for against the defendants. After transfer of the brief to the newly appointed lawyer of the petitioner, noticed this mistake. Having noticed this mistake the learned Advocate for the plaintiff filed an application for withdrawal of the suit and to file a fresh suit and date was fixed for hearing on 18.9.1997.<br/><br/>5. On the other hand, the defendants took the chance of mistake committed by the learned lawyer of the plaintiff and filed an application for mandatory injunction on 10.9.1997 on the false allegation that the plaintiff forcibly took over the possession in the "Ka" schedule land.<br/><br/>6. The application filed by the plaintiff for withdrawal of the suit was fixed for hearing on 18.9.1997. The plaintiff also filed an application praying time for filing written objection in pursuance of the application for mandatory injunction filed by the defendants.<br/><br/>7. The trial Court allowed the application for mandatory injunction filed by the defendant and rejected the application for permission to withdrawal the suit and to file it afresh by the plaintiff.<br/><br/>8. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid order of allowing the application for mandatory injunction in favour of the defendants and rejection of the application under Order XXIII Rules and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the plaintiff preferred Miscellaneous Appeal No.203 of 1997 and the appellate Court dismissed the appeal.<br/><br/>9. The High Court Division upon hearing the parties made the Rule absolute.<br/><br/>10. We have heard Mr. Muhammad Nawab Ali, the learned Advocate-on-Record for the petitioner as none appeared for the respondents and perused the impugned judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record.<br/><br/>11.  The High Court Division held that the opposite parties in the revisional application have no possession in the ground floor as the opposite parties to the revisional application failed to show a single scrap of paper regarding their claim. The High Court Division further held that under order XXIII Rule 1(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure the Court is empowered to permit the plaintiff to withdraw his suit or to abandoned part of his claim with liberty to suit afresh on the same cause of action is not otherwise barred. In the instant case the plaintiff of the suit filed an application stating rea­sons for withdrawal of the suit but the Courts below without considering the application in its proper perspective rejected the   same.  The High Court Division further held that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the plain­tiff of the suit was successful in making out a case for withdrawal of the suit with permission to suit afresh and according­ly the Rule was made absolute.<br/><br/>12. In the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that the High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision.<br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
