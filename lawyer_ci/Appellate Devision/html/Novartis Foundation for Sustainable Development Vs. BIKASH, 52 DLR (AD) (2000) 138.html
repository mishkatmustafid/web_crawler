Mozammel Haque</strong> issued Rule and pending hearing of the Rule, the operation of the impugned order was stayed. In the meanwhile, the present petitioner was added as respondent No. 4 in the writ petition. Thereafter, the matter was mentioned before the Division Bench presided over by <strong>Mr. Justice Khandker Mahmud-ul Hasan</strong> for vacating the order of stay. It appears from the order-sheet of the writ petition that the Division Bench presided over by <strong>Mr. justice Khandker Mahmud-ul Hasan</strong> directed Rahman, Rahman and Huq, Chartered Accountant to submit an Audit Report before the Court within 2 months. Thereafter, on 28-4-99 a prayer was made by the writ petitioner for withdrawal of the case for not on that date the Division Bench presided by <strong>Mr. KM Hasan’s</strong> passed the following order:<br/> <br/>“If the Rule is discharged on the prayer of the writ petitioner at this stage it will help the petitioner to avoid the Court’s order to assist Rahman, Rahman and Huq to prepare the audit Report. We do not intend to carry out with the Rule against the will of the writ petitioner but we also want to see that the audit report is duly prepared and placed before this Court by Rahman, Rahman and Huq before discharging the Rule.”<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> At a subsequent point of time on 31-1-2000 on the prayer of the writ-petitioner another Division Bench presided over by Mr. Justice Md. Mozammel Haque discharged the Rule for non prosecution. This order has been challenged before us by added respondent No. 4.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> Khandker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, learned Advocate appearing for added respondent No. 4 submits that when a Division Bench earlier passed an order for making an enquiry by Rahman. Rahman and Huq and to submit an audit report in Court to enquire into the financial irregularities of BIKASH, a non-government organisation, another Division Bench ought not to have simply discharged the Rule for non-prosecution when the earlier order of the enquiry was pending before the High Court Division for disposal.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> There is no dispute that the writ-petitioner who filed the writ petition can very well make a prayer for non-prosecution and it is upon the writ- petitioner to proceed with the case or not. But in the present case the order for discharge for non- prosecution ought not to have been made by another Division Bench in view of the fact that an order for inquiry was pending as per the order of another Division Bench. Judicial propriety and norm do not approve of such passing of order by another Division Bench when there was a pending order by another Division Bench. The learned Judges who passed the impugned order ought to have been very careful and mindful in passing such order.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> Now coming to the facts of the present case. Mr. SS Halder, learned Advocate appearing for the writ petitioner, submits that the case was withdrawn on 31-1-2000, but before that there was full fledged enquiry by the Director General, Non NGO Affairs Bureau, Government of Bangladesh and a report was submitted on 2-6-99 (during the pendency of the writ petition) wherein the Bureau also recommended for withdrawal of the said writ petition. In the said report, the Bureau also found that no financial irregularity was committed. Thus, on the merit of the case the withdrawal of the writ petition for non-prosecution could not be held to be irregular.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> Be that as it may, the writ petitioner having withdrawn the writ petition for non-prosecution we do not like to interfere with the impugned order.<br/> <br/>Consequently, the petition is dismissed with the observations indicated above.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></span></div></div></div>
