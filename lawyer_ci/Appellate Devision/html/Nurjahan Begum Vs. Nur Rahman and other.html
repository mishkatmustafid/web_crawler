Tafazzul Islam J. - </strong>This petition for leave to appeal arises out of the judgment and decree dated 28.8.2006 of the High Court Division passed in Civil Revision No.309 of 2004 discharging the Rule which was obtained challenging the judg­ment and decree dated 5.11.2003 passed by the Additional District Judge, Court No. 2, Rangpur in Other Appeal No.5 of 2003 affirming those of dated 24.9.2002 passed by the Joint District Judge Court No.1, Rangpur in Other Suit No. 30 of 1997 dismissing the suit.<br/><br/>2. The petitioner, as plaintiff filed the above Other Suit No.30 of 1997 for parti­tion of an area of 4.70 acres of land out of the suit jote and also for declaration that the unregistered Heba Deed dated 19.6.1948 purported to have been execut­ed by Delwar Sheikh is false and collusive on the averments that jote as described in the schedule 'Ka' of the plaint originally belonged to Deyanat Ullah who died leav­ing behind his only son Delwar Sheikh and the jote as described in schedule Kha of the plaint belonged to plaintiff and Delwar Sheikh and the jote described in schedule 'Ga' and 'Gha' of the plaint belonged to Maherunnessa, the predeces­sor in interest of the plaintiff and defen­dant No.1; while they had been possessing the land of schedule 'Ka' and 'Kha', Delwar Sheikh died before preparation of S.A. record leaving behind wife Maherunnessa, one son Nur Rahman the defendant No.1, and one daughter Nurjahan, the plaintiff; thereafter Maherunnessa died leaving behind the defendant No.1 and the plain­tiff; the defendant No.1 has been possess­ing the suit land in ejmali and though S.A. record of some Khatians have been pub­lished correctly but at the instance of the defendant No.1 some khatians have been published wrongly; the plaintiff is entitled to get 2.14 acres of land out of 'Ka' sched­ule, 2.06 acres of land out of Kha sched­ule, .38 acres of land out of schedule Ga and 12 acres of land out of schedule 'Gha' and that the plaintiff has been possessing total area of 4.70 acres of land in ejmali out of the above jotes and that Delwar Sheikh never transferred any land out of the above jotes in favour of the defendant No.1 and if any such document of transfer is shown by the defendant No.1 that will be a forged arid void document; the plain­tiff did not find conducive to possess the suit land in ejmali and so she asked for partition of the suit jotes on 10.11. 1992 which the defendant No.1 denied and hence the suit for partition.<br/><br/>3. The defendant Nos.1,16 and 18 con­tested the suit by filing joint written state­ment contending <em>inter alia</em> that the land of lot No.5 of schedule Ka belonged to Deyanatullah son Bhwa Sheikh and Deyanatullah had given <em>estafa</em> of the above land to the superior landlord who then sold the same land to the defendant No.1 vide registered deed dated 7.10.1952 and since then the defendant No.1 has been possessing the same and that Deyantullah transferred his rest land in favour of one Manajuddin by registered deed of sale dated 29.9.1995 and Minajuddin sold out an area of .15½ acres of land in favour of one Ashraful and an area of.15½ acres of land in favour of one Rafiqul and Golam Rabbani by registered deed of sale both dated 4.1.1978; that the land of lot Nos.1 to 4 of schedule Ka and Kha belonged to Dayantullah who died leaving being behind his only son Delwar Sheikh and that the defendant No.1 has purchased an area of .23 acres of land of schedule Kha and that Delwar Sheikh has transferred an area of 11.82 acres of land only out of schedule Ka and kha by an unregistered deed of Heba dated 19.6.48 and thereafter he died leaving behind no properties; that the land of schedule Ga and Gha belonged to Maherunnessa, the predecessor in interest of the plaintiff and defendant No.1, who has gifted out her entire properties orally in favour of the defendant No.1 and since then defendant No.1 has been possessing the same and he has transferred an area of 2.68 acres of land out of the suit jotes in favour of dif­ferent persons and has been possessing the remaining and that the S.A. records of the suit jote are correct.<br/><br/>4. The learned Joint District Judge, after hearing, dismissed the suit. On appeal the Additional District Judge, after hearing, dismissed the appeal. On revision the High Court Division, after hearing, dis­charged the Rule.<br/><br/>5. We have heard the learned counsel of the petitioner and perused the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and also other connected papers.<br/><br/>6. As it appears the High Court Division discharged the Rule holding that there are serious contradiction in the evidence of P.Ws. as regard possession of the plaintiff in the suit land and all the P.Ws. also remained silent as to the genuineness of the unregistered Heba    deed  dated 19.6.1948 and on the other hand S.A. record in respect of the major portion of the suit land is in the name of the defen­dant No.1 on the basis of un-registered Heba deed and other deed and further the defendant No.1  has filed S.A.  records marked as exhibits Kha to Kha (8) and also filed 26 dakhilas marked as exhibits Uma to Uma (29) and the above S.A. records and rent receipts manifestly indi­cate the <em>prima facie</em> possession of the defendant No.1 in the suit jotes and further the defendant No.1 sold 2.65 acres of land to Abdur Rahim and 7 others who are also in possession of their respective land.  Moreover the defendant No.1 adducing 5 witnesses has succeeded in proving his title on the basis of unregistered Heba deed dated 19.6.48 which appears to be genuine and which was impounded under section 35 of the Stamp Act and was taken into evidence under section 90 of the Evidence Act. However the claim of the defendant No.1 as regard schedule Ka and Kha to the effect that he acquired the same from his mother Maherunnessa by virtue of oral gift dated 15.12.1973 has not been substantiated as the defendant No.1, failed to prove the oral gift by the evidence of D.W.5 who deposed that he did not see the mother of defendant No.1 both the trial court as well as the appellate court below also concurrently found that the oral gift dated 15.12.73 has not been proved. But since the possession of the defendant No.1 has been proved for more than 12 years, he is entitled to get title even on the basis of invalid title though the defendant No.1 did not specifically claim title by adverse possession vide the decision reported in <strong><em>7 DLR 94.</em></strong><br/><br/>7. We are of the view that the High Court Division on proper consideration of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision and there is no illegality or infir­mity in the above decision so as to call for any interference.<br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
