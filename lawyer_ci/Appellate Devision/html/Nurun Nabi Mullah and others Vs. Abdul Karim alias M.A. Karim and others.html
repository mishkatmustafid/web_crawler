Ruhul Amin J.- </strong>This is plaintiff's appeal by leave against the judgment and order dated July 16, 2001of a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 232 of 1999 making the Rule absolute upon setting aside the judgment and decree of September 15, 1998 of the 3rd Court of Additional District Judge, Dhaka in Title Appeal No. 144 of 1998 dismissing the same and thereby affirming the judgment and decree dated April 16, 1998 of the 1st Court of Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Dhaka in Title Suit No. 16 of 1989 decreeing the suit in preliminary form in respondent of the land measuring .3471 acre. The suit was filed seeking declaration of title, recovery of possession and for allotment of sep­arate saham upon partition of the property described in schedule 'ka' attached to the plaint.<br/><br/>2. Plaintiffs filed the suit stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the land measuring 1.15 acres appertaining to plot No. 685 of C.S. Khatian No. No. 104 cor­responding to S.A. Khatian No. 1236 of Mouza Badda under Police Station Gulshan, District Dhaka as described in the schedule 'ka' to the plaint along with the entire land of C.S. Khatian No. 104 belonged to Khemankari Devi and she' died leaving behind only son Barada Kanta Chakravarty (defendant No. 7) as the sole heir and while he was in exclusive possession of the property so inherited, he sold. 81 acre of land out of 1.15 acres of land of C.S. Plot No. 685 to the plaintiffs by 7 different kabalas in 1969 and delivered possession of the same to them and they got their names mutated in the revenue records and have been paying rent of the land so purchased, that they filed Miscellaneous Case No. 127 of 1969 under Section 143A of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act for correc­tion of the S.A. record and got order in their favour and thereupon S.A. khatian No. 1236 of Mouza Badda was prepared and finally pub­lished in their names, that defendant Nos. 1 and 2 purchased. 10 acre of land from plot No. 685 but they are enjoying and claiming more than their purchased land, that they are trying to cre­ate certain ante-dated forged documents in sup­port of their claim and that if the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 submit any such document must be a fraudulent, forged and not binding on the plain­tiffs, that Prabhat Chandra Shil the vendor of the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 submit any such document must be fraudulent, forged and not binding on the plaintiffs, that Prabhat chandra Shil the vendor of the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 was a barber and he was a permissive possessor of .10 acre of land under Barada Kanta Chakravarty, that the land in suit was never par­titioned by metes and bounds amongst the co-sharers and the plaintiffs are in possession of less quantity of land than their due share and although they requested the defendants for ami­cable partition of the property in suit but they did not respond, hence the suit.<br/><br/>3. The defendant Nos. 1 and 2 contested the suit by filling written statement denying the material averments made in the plaint and con­tending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit is not maintain­able and the same is bad for defect of parties as well as is barred by limitation and there is no cause of action, that Khemankari Devi, the orig­inal owner of 1.15 acres of land of Plot No. 685 settled. 61 acre from the southern side of the plot with Prabhat Chandra Shil and he was in possession of the said land by reeling dewlling huts and planting trees and he paid rent to the land lord, that they have purchased. 61 acre of land in 1962-63 from Prabhat Chandra Shil by different deeds within the knowledge of Barada Kanta Chakravarty and they are in possession of their purchased land since 1963 by erecting Pucca bhiti tin shed hut, that there is a pond in the middle of the land, that the defendants in 1996 erected hut on the eastern side and on the western side of the pond at present there is DIT road, that they have walled their land, that the DIT road over plot No. 685 covering a area of .15 acre and 0.29 acre of land which previously possessed by the tenants of Barada Kanta Chakravarty now is being possessed the tenants under the Government, that   Barada kanta Chakravarty did not sell .81 acre of land or any land to the plaintiffs and in 1969 said Barada Kanta Chakravarty had no right, title and inter­est in the land in suit and as such he had no authority to sell the land in suit and according­ly the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>4. The suit was also contested by the defen­dant Nos. 8 and 9, Secretary, Department of Primary Education and the Secretary, Department of Agriculture respectively by fil­ing joint written statement contending, inter alia, that Barada kanta Chakravarty was the owner of the land of Plot No. 685 along with land of other plots of C. S. Khatian No. 104 and in 1959 he donated .08 acre of land from plot No. 685 for construction of Union Agriculture Seed Store Building and delivered possession of the said land to the Chairman of the Union and in the year 1961 Shatarkul Union Seed Store Building was constructed in the said land and the same was handed over to the Agricultural Department and some portion of plot No. 685 is in occupation of the local Primary School for more than 20 years.<br/><br/>5. The trial Court decreed the suit in prelim­inary form upon declaring title of the plaintiffs in respect of .3471 acre of land on the finding that defendant Nos. 1 and 2 have not filed any paper in support of their claim of taking settle­ment of .61 acre of land either from Khemankari Devi or from Barada kanta Chakravarty, nor from Prabhat Chandra Shil, that dakhila (Ext.-E) submitted by the defen­dants in support of their claim of taking settle­ment appears to be not genuine, that the plain­tiffs have admitted claim of the defendants about purchase of .10 acre of land from Prabhat Chandra Shil, that the defendants although at the time of trial claimed that they took settle­ment of .61 acre of land by the ‘আমলদারী’ (Ext.-F) but the said claim of the defendants is absent in their pleading, that there was no occasion for making settlement by ‘আমলদারী’ that while the defendants purchased .10 acre of land, then there was no occasion for them to take settle­ment of .61 acre of land including the .10 acre of land earlier purchased and as such the defen­dants by their alleged settlement by ‘আমলদারী’ have not acquired any title in respect of .51 acre of land, that the signature of Barada Kanta Chakravarty appearing in Ext. F is not the gen­uine signature of Barada Kanta Chakravarty, that defendants failed to prove Ext. E by com­petent witness and that on the basis of Ext. F defendants have not acquired any interest in the land of plot No. 685, that there is no evidence from the side of the defendants that Prabhat Chandra Shil Acquired title in respect of .61 acre of land of Plot No. 685, that the defendants have acquired title in. 10 acre of land by their purchase from Prabhat Chandra Shil, that by L.A. Case No. 91 of 1957-58 Government req­uisitioned .85 acre of land and out of the requi­sitioned land DIT has constructed the Road on .2929 acre of land and that possession of the remaining land having not been taken over, the owners remain in possession of the land of the requisitioned land, that DIT has not registered any claim other than the land covered by the road construction by it, that the land purchased by the plaintiffs also comprises .17 acre of land possessed by the primary school and the Agricultural Department and as such plaintiffs can not have any claim in respect of .17 acre of land, that out of 1.15 acre of land of Plot N. 685 Khemankari Devi transferred .24 acre of land to 4 persons who are the parties in the suit and as such plaintiffs by their purchase from Barada Kanta Chakravarty have not acquired any inter­est in the said .24 acre of land, that plaintiffs although purchased .81 acre of land but as defendants have purchase .10 acre of land from Prabhat Chandra Shil, Khemankari Devi trans­ferred .24 acre of land, the road constructed by DIT covers .2929 acre of land and .17 acre of land is in the occupation of the primary school as well as the seed store of the Government, totaling .8029 acre of land, and hence upon deduction of the said quantity of land plaintiffs have acquired right, title and interest in .3471 acre of land.<br/><br/>6. The defendant Nos. 1 and 2 went on appeal. The appellate Court on detailed discus­sion of the evidence upon arriving at the finding that the trial Court did not commit any error of law and facts in decreeing the suit in prelimi­nary form and declaring title of the plaintiffs to the extent of .3471 acre of land dismissed the appeal. Thereupon the said defendants moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdic­tion.<br/><br/>7. The High Court Division upon observing that. 85 acre out of 1.15 acres of land of Plot No. 685 "was acquired" by the Government for DIT by starting L.A. Case No. 91 of 1957-58 but the plaintiffs are claiming title in. 81 acre of land of Plot No. 685 by purchase from Barada Kanta Chakravarty in the year 1969, that the plaintiffs have admitted claim of the defendants as regard .10 acre by their purchase from Prabhat Chandra Shil, that the trial Court noticed that .08 acre of land was donated by Barada Kanta Chakravarty to the Agriculture Department and that there is a primary school in. 25 acre of land of the land of Plot No. 685 and that .24 acre of land was transferred by Khemankari Devi but in spite of that trial Court upon deducting the said quantity of land acquired by defendants and other agencies decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiffs for .3471 acre of land "being occupied by D.I.T. Road, primary school and the seed store on the wrong conception of law that although .85 acre of land was acquired in the said L.A. Case, yet, the D.I.T. abandoned the claim except .2909 acre of land consumed for the road. Once the land is acquired it vests in the government through the requiring body and it does not matter whether it is used or not and the question of abandonment is unknown to the Emergency Requisition of Property Act, 1948 under which the land was acquired. After the acquisition of said. 85 acre of land from the suit plot vide L.A. Case No. 91 of 1957-58 neither Baroda Kanta Chakraborty nor any one had any saleable interest in the suit property and as such by the purchase from baroda Kanta Chakraborty on 28.4.69 and 1.7.69 the plaintiffs acquired no title to the suit property". The High court Division also held that the appellate Court totally ignored the findings of the trial court and that failed to consider the factual and legal aspect of the case as discussed by the said Division, in affirming the judgment and decree passed by the trial court.<br/><br/>8. Leave was granted to consider the con­tention that there having been no material on record to show that .85 acre of land of the suit plot was acquired by publication of notice in the official Gazette and neither any of the parties in the suit asserting that. 85 acre was acquired, nor the courts below coming to a finding of acqui­sition of .85 acre, the High Court Division com­mitted error of law in holding that the vendor of the plaintiffs had no saleable interest upon a misconception that “হুকুম দখল” is 'acquisition' which extinguishes the right of the private own­ers.<br/><br/>9. The learned Counsel entering caveat sup­ported the judgment of the High Court Division upon submitting that the property was requisi­tioned for the purpose of acquisition upon start­ing L.A. Case No. 91 of 1957-1958.<br/><br/>10. It is seen from the judgment of the High Court Division that before the said Division it was submitted from the side of the plaintiff-opposite parties, herein appellants, that the land in suit has already been de-requisitioned in favour of the plaintiffs. It is submitted by the learned Counsel of the appellants that at the time of hearing of the leave petition the appel­lants produced a Memo, dated 22.10.2001 writ­ten by the Secretary, RAJUK to the appellants that .25 acre out of .85 acre has been retained by the RAJUK for construction of the road and the rest of the acquired land has been released as per decision of the Council of the Ministers in 1991 and thereupon this Division asked the learned Additional Attorney General to obtain report from the Government as to the status of the land in suit. The learned   Additional Attorney General on 9.11.2003 requested the Secretary, Ministry of Land to furnish informa­tion in respect of the land of plot No. 685 as regard which L.A. Case NO. 91 of 1957-58 was initiated and the Ministry of land by the Memo, dated    10.11.2003 directed the Deputy Commissioner to supply the information to the learned Additional Attorney General and the Deputy Commissioner by the Memo, dated 22.11.2003 furnished the information. The con­tents of the said Memo, runs as follows:<br/><strong>"Government of Bangladesh office of the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka L.A. Department </strong>(sec-8)<br/>Memo No. জ়েঃ প্রাঃ ঢাঃ এল এ (শা-৮)/ ২০০৩-৯৩১                       dated: 22/11/03<br/>Reference: L.A. Case no. 91/57-58 <br/><br/>11. With reference to his letter dated 9.11.03 addressed to the Secretary, Ministry of Land, the following facts are furnished from our records:<br/>(a) An area of 0.85 acre of land out of 1.15 acres of the plot mentioned was requisitioned vide L.A. Case No. 91/57-58 with a view to acquire the land permanently for re-habilitation of the distressed people . But the Acquisition Gazette under section 5(7) of the Act was not published for which copy of the same could not be supplied herewith.<br/>(b) The Council of Ministers in 1991 decid­ed to release 0.57 acre of land out of 0.85 acre of requisitioned land. We are not of the facts as stated in memo dated 22.10.01 issued by the Secretary, RAJUK.<br/>Deputy Commissioner Dhaka<br/>Mr. Fida M. Kamal<br/>Additional Attorney General<br/>Supreme Court of Bangladesh<br/>Dhaka.<br/>Copy for information:<br/>Secretary<br/>Ministry of Land<br/>It has reference to his memo-Mol/ section-10/DA/44/87 (part-3) - 672 dated 10/11/03" <br/><br/>12. The High Court Division proceeded on the premise that the land has been acquired finally as per provision of Section 5(7) of the Emergency requisition of Property Act, 1948 (the Act). The admitted position is that the land was requisitioned i.e. “হুকুম দখল” by initiating L.A. Case No. 91 of 1957-58. No material was placed on record from the defendants' side that the land was acquired i.e. “অধিগ্রহন” by the Government as per provision of the Act. The fact that the land has not been acquired by the Government is clear from the Memo, of the Deputy Commissioner dated 22.11.2003 addressed to the learned Additional Attorney General. The premise i.e. land in suit has been acquired, upon which the High Court Division proceeded and finally arrived at the finding that prior to the purchase by the plaintiffs the land claimed by them vested in the Government and as such plaintiffs' vendor as had no saleable interest, the plaintiffs by their purchase did not acquire any right, title and interest in the land in suit is not correct. The judgment of the High Court Division being based on wrong and incorrect presumption i.e. the land in suit has been acquired by the Government and thereby vested in the Government and the fact of non-acquisition having been established by the Memo, dated 22.11.2003 written by the Deputy Commissioner, the finding of the High Court Division that because of vesting of the land in suit upon acquisition by the Government the plaintiffs did not acquire any right, title and interest in the land in suit is not legally sustain­able. The undenied position is that .85 acre was requisitioned i.e., “হুকুম দখল”  and as such by the said requisition the vendor of the plaintiffs hav­ing not been divested of his title on the date of transfer to the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs by their purchase in the year 1969 acquired title in the land of the plot not. 685, part of which was req­uisitioned upon initiating LA. Case No. 91 of 1957-58. The unenvied position is that posses­sion of the requisitioned land except. 25 acre utilised by the requiring body i.e. RAJUK remains with the person whose land was requi­sitioned by initiating L.A. Case No. 91 of 1957-58. It may be mentioned here that before the High Court Division at the time of hearing of the Rule and later on before this Division at the time of hearing of the leave petition it was rep­resented that land claimed by the plaintiffs has been released by the Government. The assertion so made by the plaintiffs is being supported by the Memo, dated 22.10.2001 written by the Secretary, RAJUK to the effect that .85 acre out of 1.15 acres of land of C.S. Plot No. 685 was requisitioned by initiating L.A. Case No. 91 of 1957-58 and later on in pursuant to the decision taken in the meeting of the Council of Ministers except .25 acre retained by the RAJUK the remaining land has been released. This fact is also found place in the Memo, dated 22.11.2003 written by the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka to the learned Additional Attorney General in compliance of the quarry made by him through the Ministry of Land by the Memo, dated 9.11.2003. It appears there has been confusion at the different levels of the Government con­nected with the requisition and acquisition of the land under the law empowering the Government to requisition and acquisition citi­zen's land as regard the meaning of expression "requisition" and "acquisition" and in that background the Ministry of Land has clarified the position, or in other words what actually is meant by the expressions "requisition" and "acquisition". In the Memo issued by the Ministry of Law it has been clearly mentioned that the expression "requisition" shall mean “হুকুম দখল” and the expression "acquisition " shall mean “অধিগ্রহন”.<br/><br/>13. It is noticed from the judgment of the high Court Division that the said Division pro­ceeded on the premise that the expression "req­uisition" is synonym for the expression "acqui­sition" or in other words that the words "requi­sition" and "acquisition" are interchangeable as regard requisition and acquisition of land. With all due respect for the learned Judge of the High Court Division that the learned Judge lost sight of the fact that by requisition title does not vest with the requisitioning body or the requiring body, or in other words title of requisitioned land remains with the person whose property has been requisitioned. In the instant case the undenied position is that .85 acre of land of plot No.  685 was requisitioned and it was not acquired at any time and as such at all time title remained with the plaintiffs' vendor.<br/><br/>14. The learned Counsel appearing for the Respondent No. 1 has not disputed the fact that the land requisitioned upon initiating L.A. Case No. 91 of 1957-1958 has not been acquired and as such felt difficulty to support the judgment of the High Court Division which was passed on the premise that. 85 acre of land of plot No. 685 was acquired by initiating L.A. Case No. 91 of 1957-58.<br/><br/>15. The learned Counsel representing the Respondent No. 1 submitted since there was no notice of de-requisition and consequently sym­bolical possession of the requiring body being an accepted position and as such possession of the land in suit being with the requiring body or in other words possession of the land in suit being not with the plaintiffs, the suit so filed was barred under Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act for not seeking consequential relief. The learned Counsel also submitted that even if the defendants did not raise the question of maintainability of the suit as framed the law casts duty on the Court to examine the question of maintainability of the suit and to give its finding on the issue of maintainability.<br/><br/>16.  It may be mentioned the undisputed position is that although .85 acre of land of plot No. 685 was requisitioned but possession of the entire requisitioned but possession of the entire requisitioned land was not taken over either by the Government or by the requiring body i.e. RAJUK, It is seen from the judgment of the trial Court and the appellate Court as well as from the materials on record that RAJUK for the pur­pose of construction of the road has utilized from requisitioned land only .2929 acre or .25 acre as claimed by RAJUK in its Memo, dated 22,10.2001 (Annexure-A in the supple­mentary paper book) and that the plaintiffs are entitle to. 3471 acre as has been found by the trial Court after deduction of the transactions took place prior to the purchase by the plaintiffs from Barada Kanta Chakravarty. The plaintiffs have filed the suit seeking partition of the land in suit upon declaration of title and recovery of possession against the persons impleaded in the suit as defendants. It has already been found except .25 acre the remaining requisitioned land has been released by the authority concerned. In that state of the matter the contention raised by the learned Counsel for the Respondent No. 1 that the suit framed was not maintainable since symbolic possession of the land in suit was with the requiring body is legally not well founded. Amongst others plaintiffs have prayed for the relief recovery possession against the defen­dants. The other contention of the learned Counsel for the Respondent No. 1 that no for­mal notice was issued for de-requisition of the land is also of no merit since from the papers i.e. Annexure-A (RAJUK's letter dated 22.10.2001 addressed to the appellant No. 1) and Annexure-D (Memo, dated 22.11.2003 of the office of Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka written to learned Additional Attorney General) in the supplementary paper book it is seen that decision has already been taken at the highest level to de-requisition the property and the requiring body is quite aware of the said matter. It appears the requiring body in the background of the decision of the competent authority derequisitioning .57 acre out of .85 acre has not inspite of being party, contested the suit at any stage disputing or questioning claim of the plaintiffs.<br/>In view of the discussions made herein-above we find merit in the appeal.<br/>Accordingly the appeal is allowed. There is no order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
