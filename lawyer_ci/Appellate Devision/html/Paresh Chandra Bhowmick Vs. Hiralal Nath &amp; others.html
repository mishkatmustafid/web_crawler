The appellant, Paresh Chandra Bhowmick, is executor of the will in question namely, the will Ext. 1, purportedly executed by his grand-father-in-law, Haricharan Nath on November 3, 1963 corresponding to 16th, Kartick 1370 B.S. By this will the entire property of the testator was bequeathed to the appellant who is husband of Indu Prova, grand-daughter of the testator through his only son Rajendra who is admittedly an Indian national. Case of the appellant propounder is that Haricharan Nath, aged about 75, was attacked with partial paralysis in the right side of his body about three months before his death and that his only son Rajendra having migrated to India about 15 years ago, Rajendra's daughter and her husband Paresh remained in Pakistan and as such they looked after him. Haricharan had a second wife, Krishana Moni Devi, defendant No. 2, but he did not consider her to be the proper person to look after his property on his death. On 3 November 1963 Haricharan Nath executed the will in presence of members of the locality, both Hindus and Muslims, by putting his left thumb impressions on the document; though he was literate he could not sign his name because of partial paralysis; and that this was the last will of Haricharan. Three months thereafter, that is, on 5 February 1964, Hari­charan died in his house in village Kerua, district Noakhali. The appellant filed an application being Miscellaneous Case No. 136 of 1966 praying for a Probate of the Will but it was dismissed for default. Thereafter he filed Title Suit No. 5 of 1976 (Probate) before the District Judge, Noakhali, seeking probate of the will.<br/><br/>3. The suit was contested by Krishna Moni Devi, respondent No. 2 who seriously disputed the will contending that her hus­band did not execute any will but the dis­puted  will was ante-dated having been fabricated and forged after his death by Paresh in collusion with the scribe. Her further contention was that Hiralal, one of the sons of Rajendra, did not migrate to India but was a Pakistani national and resided with her and her husband in the same house and as such Hiralal was the proper person besides her to look after the property of her husband. She also contended that the property was all along in her possession.<br/><br/>4. The learned District Judge on con­sideration of evidence led by both the parties held that the execution of the will was satisfactorily proved as the last will of the testator and on that finding passed a decree on 27 February, 1978 granting probate of the will. But on appeal by defendant Krishna Moni Devi, a Division Bench of the High Court Division reversed the finding of the District Judge, and holding that the execu­tion of the will was   not duly proved on fulfilling the requirements of section 63 of the Succession Act, cancelled the probate and dismissed the suit. The High Court Division further observed that in view of some "unnatural, unfair and inhuman aspect of the matter" in which the widow and a grand son of the testator stood totally deprived of the property and also of "suspicious circum­stances surrounding the making of the will" which were not explained by the propounder, the District Judge failed to make cor­rect assessment of the evidence adduced in the case.<br/><br/>5. Leave was granted to consider whether there were any, patent unfairness and inhuman and unnatural aspects in the matter of this testamentary disposition of the property or whether there were any suspicious circum­stances surrounding the execution of the will which the profounder of the will failed to remove or explain.<br/><br/>6. Appellant, propounder, set up the will seeking its probate, and as such it is he on whom lies the entire responsibility for proving that the will was duly executed by the testator as his last will. Due execution of a will means not only that the testator executed it by putting his signature or affixing his mark, that is thumb impression, but also requires that the testator execu­ted it in sound disposing mind, fully know­ing the nature and effect of his action. In other words, it must be proved that the testator had 'testamentary capacity' at the time he put his signature or thumb impression on the will. When a written will is sought to be proved, it must be proved by fulfilling the statutory provisions namely, provisions of sections 67 and 68 of the Evidence Act governing proof of a document. In addition, the special requirements of section 63 of the Succession Act shall also have to be fulfilled. In the instant case the question of the testa­tor's testamentary capacity that is, whether he was in sound mind and had the capacity to comprehend the nature of the thing he was going to do, was not raised by the caveator, whose only contention was that no will was executed by her husband but that the impug­ned will was fabricated and forged after his death. As such, it is to be seen, first of all, whether the will Ext. 1, was executed by the purported testator, Haricharan Nath. Four witnesses have deposed that the will was executed by Haricharan Nath in their presence. They are P.W. 1 Paresh, the profounder, P.W. 2 Chandra Shekhar Majumder, the scribe, P.W. 3 Hare Krishna Devnath, a relation of the testator and P.W. 4 Abdul Huq, member of the Local Union Council. Their uniform evidence is that at the instance of Haricharan they and some other members of the locality were brought to his courtyard on 16th Kartick 1370 B.S., that Haricharan expressed his intention to make a will, that at his dictation the scribe wrote the will which was then read over to him after which he put his left thumb impressions on the will. P.W. 2, the scribe himself took those thumb impressions on the will and put his signature below each of these thumb impressions. P.W. 1 is of course, a person interested in the will; but P. Ws. 2, 3 and 4 are found to be quite disinterested persons. There is no suggestion that they had any motive to depose falsely in support of the will. For proof of execution of a will, section 63 of the Succes­sion Act requires at least two attesting wit­nesses each of whom has seen the testator sign his name or affix his mark to the will. This requirement has been fulfilled by the evidence of these four witnesses.<br/><br/>7. In addition to this direct evidence as to execution of the will, there is expert evidence recorded under section 45 of the Evidence Act. This is the evidence of P.W. 5, a hand-writing expert. He compared the thumb impressions purportedly of Haricharn on the will with a number of thumb impres­sions purportedly of Haricharan appearing in two previous sale-deeds, being re­gistered, (Exts. 6 and 7). These sale-deeds recorded transfer of some lands by Hari­charan to third parties a few years before his death. The thumb impressions in those registered documents were taken by the learned District Judge as "standard thumb impressions of Haricharan", and P.W. 5, by making comparison between these two sets of thumb impressions, expressed the opinion that all these thumb impressions were product of the same person. In support of this view he referred to as many as 15 peculiarities, formations and patterns of the ridges which were common in both sets of the thumb impressions. Since examination of finger prints is almost an accurate science the learn­ed District Judge took the expert's opinion as additional evidence of the execution of the will by Haricharan.<br/><br/>8. The learned Judges of the High Court Division however rejected the direct evidence of execution of the will given by P. Ws. 1, 2, 3 and 4 and the expert opinion given by P.W. 5. They have placed reliance upon the evidence of D. W. 1 Krishna Moni Devi and three other witnesses—D.Ws. 2-4 who deposed that no will was executed by Haricharan. But P. Ws. 1-4 asserted that Krishna Moni Devi (D. W. 1) was present in the courtyard when her husband had exe­cuted the will, but since she was illiterate she was not made an attesting witness of the will. As to D. W. 2, his name is also Hare Krishna; he said that he was not an attesting witness of the will. But on due consideration of the evidence the trial Court found that D. W. 2 Hare Krish­na is a different person from P.W. 3 Hare Krishna, son of Nabadwip, who is an attesting witness of the will. As to DW. 3 Ramesh Chandra, his name, is there in the will as one of the attesting wit­nesses, but he has disowned the signature saying that he was not aware of any such will nor did he put any signa­ture thereon. Suggestion put to him on behalf of the profounder is that he was gained over by Krishnamoni. D. W. 4 is Hiralal, one of the six sons of Rajendra. He has said that though his father had migrated to India long ago, he was living with Hari­charan and Krishna Moni Devi all along in Pakistan and that no will was executed by his grandfather. The evidence of P.W. 1 is that Hiralal had migrated to India along with his father but was brought to Pakistan by Krishna Moni Devi after the will was executed and that he came from India with an Indian passport and started creating trouble putting obstruction to the profounder getting any benefit under the will. It was further suggested that as his visa had expired he was taken into custody for 21 days. His father, Rajendra, had six sons and six daughters and according to P.W. 1, all except Indu Prova were Indian nationals all through. Considering these facts and circumstances the learned District Judge disbelieved the evidence of D. W. 4 Hiralal, and weighing these two sets of evidence, one of P. Ws. and the other of D. Ws., found the evidence given by the P. Ws. to be true and reliable. Since the trial Court is in a better position to appreciate the oral evidence of the witnesses whose demeanour is ob­served, the appellate Court should ordinarily be slow to disagree with the trial Court's assessment of evidence.<br/><br/>9. As to the opinion of the hand writing expert P. W.5, the learned Judges of the High Court Division did not accept the thumb impressions in the registered sale-deeds, (Exts. 6 and 7) as "standard thumb-impressions" of Haricharan by simple observation that the execution of those docu­ments was not proved under section 68 of the Evidence Act. This observation we are unable to accept as correct since it is erro­neous from the view point of both law and fact. Firstly, execution of those registered documents in favour of third parties was never challenged, and secondly, in respect of the sale-deed Ext. 6 there is an attesting witness P.W. 6 who has deposed that the sale-deed was executed by Haricha­ran in his presence by putting his left thumb impression. As to the sale-deed Ext. 7, P.W. 7, has deposed that he had identified the executant Haricharn before the Sub-Registrar whereupon the sale-deed was registered. This witness did not attest the document, Ext. 7, and as such he was not an attesting witness, but when he identified the executants Haricharan before the Sub-Registrar then, at least it was proved that Haricharan appeared before the Sub-Registrar to get registered a document which was purpor­tedly executed by him. In this sense it is not wholly’ corrects to say that P.W. 7 was not an attesting witness of the document. Even if his evidence is rejected then the thumb impression on the sale deed Ext. 7 may go out of consideration. But so far as proof of the sale deed Ext. 6 is concerned, its execution has been proved by the attesting witness P. W.6. As such, the thumb impression in Ext. 6. is the standard thumb impression of Haricharan, and this thumb impression having agreed with the impugned thumb impression on the will—in respect of ridge peculiarities, patterns and forma­tions, there, is no room for doubt about the expert opinion of P. W. 5. There is a sug­gestion that P. W. 5 deposed falsely acting in collusion with the profounder. This is a baseless suggestion; if there was any genuine doubt about his opinion, the caveator could have prayed for opinion of some other hand­writing expert.<br/><br/>10. On the evidence of P. Ws. 1-4 re-informed by the evidence of the hand-writing expert P. W.5, there is no reason to hold that the will was not executed by Haricharan. But mere putting signature or finger print on a document does not mean that the document has been executed by the person putting the signature or placing the impression; the signature or thumb impression of the testator shall be so placed, as specifically prescribed in section 63 of the Evidence Act, that it shall appear that it was intended thereby to give effect to the writing of the will. This raises the question of testamentary capacity of the testator that is, the testator had full sense, he was in sound mind and he understood the nature and effect of his action in putting his signature or placing his mark on the document. Of course when it is found that the purported testator put his signature or mark on the will, then it shall be presumed that he knew the nature and effect of his action. But this pre­sumption is liable to be rebutted by proof of suspicious circumstances surrounding the will. In this case, it is not contention of the cavea­tor that the testator had no testamentary capa­city at the relevant time; rather she con­tended than her husband was not suffering from any paralysis or any serious illness. Her contention was that no. will was executed by her husband. Even if the caveator did not raise the question of testamentary capacity, yet the profounder is not exonerated from the incumbent duty to prove that the testator had second and disposing mind and that he fully understood the nature and effect of his action in executing the will. This onus is found to have been discharged by the profounder in this case. Next question that arises in connection with due execution is whether the execution has been obtained by undue influence, fraud, coercion or misrepre­sentation of facts. No such suggestion was made by the caveator since her case was all along that no will was at all executed by her husband. The Privy Council, in the case of <strong><em>Harmes Vs. Hinkson, AIR 1946 PC 156</em></strong>, held that ''the burden of proving that the will is the outcome of undue influence exercised on the testator is on those who attack the will."<br/><br/>11. But even if there was no suggestion from the caveator that the will was obtained by undue influence, misrepresentation or coercion, it is the solemn duty of the court to satisfy its conscience that the will of a person who is no longer alive to support or deny it, is free from any infirmity. The trend of questions raided on behalf of the respondent and which were also considered by the High Court Division shows that the execution of this will was charged with suspicion and the learned Judges found it to be unfair, unusual and inhuman in that the grand-daughter's husband was given preference to the wife and the grandson who, under the will, stood totally deprived of the property. It was also obser­ved by the learned Judges that the will was written without the help of any draft, that the thumb impression of the testator was put at the top of the document instead of the bottom and that there is no medical evidence in sup­port of the paralysis of the testator affecting his right hand due to which he allegedly failed to sign his name.<br/><br/>12. Mr. B.B. Roy Chowdhury, learned Advocate for the respondent has made stre­nuous effort to defend the High Court Divi­sion's judgment particularly referring to these suspicious circumstances surrounding execu­tion of the will and has sought support from, a number of decisions from Indian jurisdiction particularly in the cases of <strong><em>Smt. Jaswant Kaur V. Smt. Amrit Kaur and others, AIR 1977 (SC) 74 &amp; H. Ventakachala Iyengar Vs. BN Timmajama, AIR 1959 (SC) 443</em></strong>. In these cases the suspicious circumstances in which the wills were executed were examined by the court which observed that in such position the burden of proof of due execution becomes heavier for the profounder, or the person who claims under the will and that the Court in such cases must take every caution in accepting the evidence as to due execution and that if on careful investigation the suspi­cion is not removed, then the evidence as to execution should be rejected. In the first mentioned case (<strong><em>AIR 1977</em></strong>) the Indian Supreme Court observed:<br/>"In cases where execution of a will is shrouded in suspicion, its proof ceases to be a simple is between the plain­tiff and the defendant. What, generally, is an adversary proceeding becomes in such cases a matter of the court's cons­cience and then the true question which arises for consideration is whether the evidence led by the profounder of the will is such as to satisfy the conscience of the court that the will was duly exe­cuted by the testator. It is impossible to reach such satisfaction unless the party which sets up the will offers a cogent and convincing explanation of the suspicious circumstances surrounding the making of the will."<br/><br/>13. In both these cases probates were granted by the District Judge but on appeal the High Court can­celled the probates finding that 'suspicious circumstances' were not explained. Facts of those cases are quite different from that of the instant case. In this case no suspicious circumstances remained unexplained. All the questions raised on behalf of the respondent have been duly answered by the learned Dis­trict Judge. The only question that deserves consideration is why Hiralal and Krishna Moni were deprived of the testator's pro­perty. As to Hiralal, he is found to have migrated to India. He has of course claimed to be a Pakistani national. But when his father along with the entire family had mig­rated to India it is quite unusual on the part of a young boy, as Hiralal was at the rele­vant time, to remain in Pakistan. So far as the testator's wife is concerned, she, of course, has been deprived of the property and no provision has been made for her, and the testator's action in this respect is unfair and also unusual and this fact raises 'suspicion'. But the suspicions is found to have been removed by the profounder who explained that he being the only male rela­tion of the testator remaining in Pakistan, Krishna Moni was not considered a fit person to look after the property on his death; and as to means of her livelihood, verbal explana­tion has been given that on her husband's death the widow was to join the family in India; besides she got her parents in this country to look after her. The High Court Division however did not accept this explana­tion as nowhere it was mentioned in the evidence of the witnesses. But the very fact of testamentary disposition is associated with preferring some heirs to others, causing deprivation to one for the benefit of another and if the testator, who got absolute right to dispose of his property by will under Hindu Law, of his own volition and in perfect sense causes such deprivation, the court is helpless to mitigate the deprivation.<br/><br/>14. The rules governing proof of due execution of a will which is charged with suspicion were examined by the Privy Council in the case of <strong>‘<em>Harmes v. Hinkson' </em></strong>as referred to above. It was observed there:-<br/>''Those rules enjoin a reasonable skepticism, not an obdurate persistence in disbelief. They do not demand from the Judge, even in circums­tances of grave suspicion, a resolute and impenetrable incredulity. He is never required to dose his mind to the truth.”<br/>We have given our anxious consideration to the fact that by the impugned will the testator deprived his wife of the property. But in view of satisfactory proof of due execution of the will by the testator who executed it in full sense and by free will and volition influenced by any quarter, this deprivation cannot be a ground to refuse probate to the executor in terms of the will. In the cir­cumstances, the District Judge's order grant­ing probate should not have been reversed by the High Court Division, as 'judicial conscience is found to have been satisfied in this case.<br/><br/>15. In the result, the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment of the High Court Division is set aside and that of the District Judge is restored. No order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
