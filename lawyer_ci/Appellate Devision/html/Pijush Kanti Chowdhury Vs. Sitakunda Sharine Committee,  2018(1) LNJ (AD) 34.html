Article 104 of the Constitution is an extra-ordinary power given to this Division to issue orders or directions as may be necessary for doing complete justice in a cause or matter-pending before it. This power can be exercised in a cause or matter which is pending before this Division when it is found that no remedy is available to the appellant for gross injustice caused to him for no fault of his own. In view of the administrative reforms of 1983 creating separate District of Cox’s Bazar, emerging social needs, informational development and formation of different professional groups, the amendment so made by the High Court Division is not sufficient to meet the requirement of the requirement of the present day. Performance of religious acts and developments would be difficult without co-ordinate efforts of different professional bodies and social organizations. Again, to amend the Scheme it has to be kept in view that the amendment does not jeopardize or compromise the interest of the Deities and the holiness of the place of pilgrimage. Therefore, we are inclined to invoke extra ordinary power of this Division under Article 104 of this Constitution for reconstituting the Sitakunda Shrine Committee, by further amendment and modification of the Scheme amended by the High Court Division, in the best interest of the Shrines under the unified command and control without affecting the basic tenets and character of the existing Scheme. The reconstitution of the committee would not charge the unitary and indivisible character of the shrines. Accordingly, the scheme for the Sitakunda Shrine Committee as amended by the High Court Division for managing and Administering the three Temples are further modified and amended by reconstituting the Shrine Committee by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">           </span>. . .

It has been further stated that the Partition of India took place in 1947 and subsequent to the aforesaid judgment of the Calcutta High Court dated 14.05.1947, the administrative reforms resulted in bifurcation of Cox's Bazar as independent District in the year 1983 and as such the aforesaid Management Committee as constituted by the Calcutta High Court has become obsolete. It is to be mentioned here that there is at present no District Board at Chittagong or Cox's Bazar and as such the question of representative of elected Hindu members of such District Board does not arise. Secondly, even if there was any such District Board after the Partition of India in 1947, there was hardly any Hindu member. There is a provision for representative of Hindu elected members of Chittagong Municipality but Chittagong Municipality is no longer in existence and in its place Chittagong City Corporation has been created and there has not been a Hindu member in Chittagong Municipality or Chittagong City Corporation for a long time, and though there is one Hindu member in Chittagong City Corporation but she is not in the Management Committee that according to the Scheme there should be one representative of the Bharat Sevasram Sangha but after the Partition of India in 1947, there has been no Bharat Sevasram Shangha in the then East Pakistan nor in present Bangladesh. There is also no Mohunt in any of the Temple at present and as such there is no Muhunt in the Management Committee. In view of the above, Management Committee as sanctioned by the Calcutta High Court is non est, under the Scheme. The administrative reforms of 1983 resulting in creation of separate District for Cox's Bazar, has put Adinath Temple at Moheshkhali outside the territorial jurisdiction of Chittagong District Judge and as such the administration of Adinath Temple at Moheshkhali which is now under the jurisdiction of Cox's Bazar is being hampered. Many of the properties belonging to Adinath Temple at Moheshkhali has been included in the khas khatian of the Government in the last B.S. Survey. Besides, many other properties for lack of proper maintenance, care and custody have been under illegal occupation of trespassers and intruders causing mismanagement and mal-administration in the Management Committee of the said Temple being far away from Cox's Bazar; that after the creation of Cox's Bazar as a separate District no representative from Cox's Bazar or nominee of District Judge of Cox's Bazar was included in that Management Committee that in the District of Chittagong under Fatickchari Police Station the Temple of Chandranath<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>and under Sitakunda Police Station the Temple<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>of Kanchannath are situated.

No. 398 of 1911 cannot be amended by the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh.

Article 104 of the Constitution is an extra-ordinary power given to this Division to issue orders or directions as may be necessary for doing complete justice in a cause or matter pending before it. This power can be exercised in a cause or matter which is pending before this Division when it is found that no remedy is available to the appellant for gross injustice caused to him for no fault of his own. In the case of Delhi Development Authority v. Skipper Construction Company (P)Ltd and another reported in AIR 1996 SC 2005 the Supreme Court of India observed that <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">“</strong> the power under Article 142 is meant to supplement the existing legal framework-to do complete justice between the parties- and not to supplant it. It is conceived to meet situations which cannot be effectively and appropriately tackled by the existing provisions of law. As a matter of fact, we think it advisable to leave this power undefined and uncatalogued so that it remains elastic enough to be molded to suit the given situation. The very fact that this power is conferred only upon this Court, and on no one else, is itself an assurance that it will be used with due restraint and circumspection, keeping in view the ultimate object of doing complete justice between the parties.<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">”</strong> The Supreme Court of India further observed: <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">“</strong>The absence of a statutory provision will not inhibit this Court while acting under the said Article from making appropriate orders for doing complete justice between the parties. The fiduciary relationship may not exist in the present case nor is it a case of a holder of public office, yet if it is found that someone has acquired properties by defrauding the people and if it is found that the persons defrauded should be restored to the position in which they would have been but for the said fraud, the Court can make all necessary orders. This is what equity means and in India the Courts are not only Courts of law but also Courts of equity.<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">”</strong><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-language: HE;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">13.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-language: HE;">In the case of Kalyan Chandra Sarkar v.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Rajesh Ranjan<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Alias Pappu<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Yaday and another reported in (2005)3 SCC 284 at page 294 the Supreme Court of India observed: <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">“</strong>The plenary powers of this Court under Article 142 of the constitution are inherent in the court and are complementary to those powers which are specifically conferred on the Court by various statutes though are not limited by those statutes. These powers also exist independent of the statutes with a view to do complete justice between the parties... and are in the nature of supplementary powers... (and) may be put on a different and perhaps even wider footing than ordinary inherent powers of a court to prevent injustice. The advantage that is derived from a constitutional provision couched in such a wide compass is that it prevents “clogging or obstruction of the stream of justice<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">”</strong>. The Supreme Court further observed that “Article 142 vests the Supreme Court with a repository of discretionary power that can be wielded in appropriate circumstances to deliver “complete” justice in a given case.
