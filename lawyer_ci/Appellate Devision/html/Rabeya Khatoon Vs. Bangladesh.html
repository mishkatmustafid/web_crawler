Tafazzul Islam J.-</strong> This petition for leave to appeal arises out of the judgment and order dated 3-4-2005 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 2898 of 1999 making the Rule absolute.<br/><br/>2. The petitioner filed Title Suit No. 41 of 1986 in the Court of learned Assistant Judge, Sadar, Jessore praying for permanent injunction and also for eviction of the defendant No. 3 from a portion of the suit land on the averments, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit land was acquired by the Government to rehabi­litate the refugees coming from India and thereafter, the Government allotted the suit land to one Rustom Ali who after constructing house started living therein; Rustam Ali then entered into a contract for sale of the suit land with one Abdul Jabber, the defendant No. 4, on 25-12-1969 and also handed over the possession of the suit land to him; Abdul Jabber then by a registered kabala executed and registered on 11-12-1983 transferred the suit land to the plaintiff at a consideration of Taka 12000; the plaintiff, after purchase, permitted defendant No. 4 and also his wife, the defendant No. 3, to stay in a portion of the suit land for some days; the defendant No. 4 subsequently divorced defendant No. 3 and lived separately with his new wife leaving defen­dant No. 3; the defendant No.3 then, with an ulterior motive, applied to the Government for allotment of the suit land in her favour whereupon the defendant No. 1, without holding any inquiry, served notice dated 19-1-1996 upon the plaintiff to hand over pos­session of the land to the Government but, however, in view of the objection filed by the plaintiff, the Government abstained from evicting the plaintiff from the suit land; the allotment of suit land in favour of Rustam Ali is genuine and proper; the Government is taking steps to evict the plaintiff from the suit land and hence the suit. The defendant Nos. 1 and 2, that is Deputy Commissioner, Jessore and Relief and Rehabilitation Officer, Jessore respectively, contested the suit and filed joint written statement contending that in view of the pro­visions under sections 14 and 14 Ka of Emergency Requisition and Acquisition Act 1948 and in the absence of seeking consequential relief of khas pos­session, the suit is not maintainable; the Govern­ment acquired the suit land along with other lands for rehabilitation of refugees coming from India and the relief and rehabilitation authority allotted the said land to refugees and also sanctioned loan of cash money to them for constructing house on the allotted land on certain conditions which, amongst others, provided that the land is not transferable before repayment of loan and getting final transfer deed as provided in Circular Nos. 414 dated 7-2-50 and Circular No. 215/RR dated 16-2-52; Rustam Ali in pursuance of the aforesaid circulars did not take possession of the suit land in Relief Block No. 160/41 and he also did not try to take any final transfer deed from the Government by paying all the dues and as a result suit land remained in khas possession of the Government; Asia Khatun, the defendant No. 3, used to live in the suit land and after she prayed for allotment of the suit land for her residential purpose, the Government, on inquiry, cancelled the temporary allotment made to Rustam Ali and allotted the suit land to her; the plaintiff did not buy the suit land on complying with provisions of law; after the defendant Nos. 1/2 directed the plaintiff to vacate the suit property she agreed to vacate the land on 12-2-86 and Dr. Masudur Rah­man, Chairman of the Committee for Refugees, tried to mediate the matter but the plaintiff then filed the present suit. The defendant No.3 also filed anot­her written statements more or less on the same line.<br/><br/>3. The learned Senior Assistant Judge, Jessore, on consideration of the materials on record by judgment and decree dated 20-4-1992 decreed the suit. Being aggrieved the plaintiff preferred Title Appeal No. 285 of 1992 while the defendant No. 3 also filed Title Appeal No. 151 of 1992 and the learned Additional District Judge, Jessore, after hearing the above appeals analogously, by judgment and decree dated 31-3-1996 dismissed both the appeals. The defendant No. 1 then moved the High Court Division and obtained Rule in Civil Revision No. 2898 of 1999 and after hearing the High Court Division made the Rule absolute directing the plain­tiff petitioner to vacate the suit land and hand over the khas possession of the same to the respondent No. 1 within 60 days form the date of judgment.<br/><br/>4. We have heard the learned Counsel and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other records.<br/><br/>5. As it appears, the High Court Division made the Rule absolute holding that admittedly the suit land was acquired by the Government for rehabi­litation of the refugees who migrated to then East Pakistan from India and that the suit land was allotted to Rustom Ali and admittedly Rustom Ali, after getting allotment of the suit land, did not construct any homestead on the same and allowed the defendant No. 4 to possess the suit land on the strength of an agreement, Exhibit-2, in contraven­tion of terms and conditions of the allotment, inas­much as clause 5 of the letter of allotment, which has been marked as Exhibit-A3, provides that the allottees must maintain the houses at their own expenses whenever necessary and they may construct additional sheds according to their requirement within their compound at their own cost with previous permission of the collector but the refugees will have no right to sell or otherwise dispose of the land and buildings; however, if any refugee migra­ted at any time he will have to make over the land and buildings to the Collector who will dispose those on the advice of the Government; thus Exhibit -A3 shows that Rustom Ali had no right to make any transfer or sell the suit land in favour of Abdul Jabbar as admittedly, Rusatom Ali did not execute any sale deed in favour of Abdul Jabbar and the very claim of the plaintiff is that Abdul Jabbar, on the strength of a contract, entered into possession of the suit land and sold the suit land in favour of the plain­tiff by the kabala deed dated 11-12-1983 though admittedly Abdul Jabbar did not acquire any title in the suit land on the basis of the agreement dated 25-12-1987 and so, by kabala deed dated 11-12-1983, the plaintiff did not acquire any title in the suit land; further admittedly the Government did not enter into any contact with the plaintiff and did not hand over possession of the suit land in favour of the plaintiff and accordingly the plaintiff is nothing but a trespasser upon the suit land on the strength of Exhibits 1 and 2; further in terms of section 5 of East Pakistan Ordinance No. XXIV of 1970 the Deputy Commissioner, Jessore, with a view to get recovery of possession of the suit land from the plaintiff and other unauthorised occupants, duly issued a notice which has been marked as Exhibit A5 and the plaintiff, although gave an undertaking by writing to hand over possession of the suit land in favour of the defendant, filed the suit and got a temporary injunction restraining the Government from taking over possession of the suit land; further the plaintiff, being an unauthorised occupant in the suit land, had also no <em>locus standi</em> to maintain a suit for permanent injunction against the defendants who in exercise of the power under section 5 of the Ordinance XXIV of 1970 duly issued notice and neither the learned Assistant Judge nor the learned Additional District Judge considered this aspect of the matter; it is the settled principle of law that a trespasser cannot maintain a suit for permanent injunction against a rightful owner; both the Courts below misread the provisions of Article 42 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, inasmuch as the plaintiff, being a trespasser, cannot get protection of law to retain her ill possession in the suit land; the notice of eviction was served upon the plaintiff on 19-1-1986 whereupon the plaintiff undertook to hand over the possession of the suit land on 1-2-1986 but instead filed the instant suit on 4-2-1986 and it is after filing of the suit that she on 28-1-1987, got Exhibit 3 which is hit by the principle of <em>lis pendens</em> as provided in section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act; moreover, the defendant No. 1, after taking preliminary steps for eviction of the plaintiff, issued the notice vide Exhibit-A5 for eviction of an unauthorised occupant from government land and the right of the Government to evict the defendant cannot be defeated by creating a subsequent kabala from Rustom Ali whose allotment deed had already been cancelled by order dated 7-12-1986 and after the above cancellation, Rustom Ali had no right to execute and register any kabala in favour of the plaintiff.<br/><br/>6. We are of the view the High Court Division on proper consideration of the evidence and the materials on record arrived at a correct decision. The learned Counsel could not point at any illegality or infirmity in the decision of the High Court Division so as to call for any interference.<br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
