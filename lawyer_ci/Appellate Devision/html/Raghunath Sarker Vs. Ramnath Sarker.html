In support of his submissions, he referred to Section 357 of Mulla's Hindu Law 18th Edition by Satyajeet A Desai, which deals with what properties may be dis­posed off by gift, which runs as follows: A father under Dayabhaga law, may by gift, dispose of the whole of his proper­ty, whether ancestral or self-acquired, sub­ject to the claims of those who are entitled to be maintained by him. The reason is that according to the Bengal School, 'where property is held by the father (as the head of the family), his issue have no legal claim upon him or the prop­erty except for their maintenance. He can dispose it off as he pleases, and they can­not require a partition. The sons have no ownership while the father is alive and free from defect. Upon his death, the prop­erty in the sons arises, and with it the right to a partition' (ss. 273, 275)3. A father under Mitakshara law has no such power over joint family property. He cannot dis­pose of it, not even his own interest there­in, by gift. In certain cases, however, he has a special power, by virtue of his posi­tion as father, to dispose off, by gift, a small portion of joint family property (ss. 225 and 226).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ….

Aftab Hossain, Advocate-on-Record-For the Appellant.</em><br/><em>Bivash Chandra Biswas, Advocate-on-Record-For the Respondent.</em><br/><br/><strong>Civil Appeal No. 37 of 2004.</strong><br/>(From the judgment and order dated 21-05-2001 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 448 of 2000)<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"> <br/><strong>Judgment                      </strong></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>              <br/>Md. Hossan Ameen J. -</strong> This appeal, by way of leave, at the instance of the plaintiff, is directed against the judgment and order dated 21.5.2001 passed by the High Court Division discharging the rule in Civil Revision No. 448 of 2000 filed against the judgment and decree dated 25. 08. 1999 passed by Additional District Judge, 5th Court, Dhaka, in Title Appeal No. 333 of 1999 reversing those dated 31.05.1999 of the Assistant Judge, Savar Thana, Dhaka in Title Suit No. 181 of 1996 and remanding the suit for re-trial.<br/><br/>2. The appellant filed the suit for declaring that the 'Kha' schedule deed appearing in the plaint is void, collusive, illegal, fraudulent, forged and not binding upon the plaintiff and the plaintiffs case, in short, is that the lands mentioned in the ‘Kha’ schedule in the plaint belonged to Horidash Sarker, and that he lived in the 'Kha' schedule land along with his wife and 2 sons. The defendant with a view to grabbing the entire paternal properties erected the deed of gift No. 3028 dated 02.03.1987, one day the defendant brought a vendee to sell the land and then the plaintiff asked the defendant why he has brought the vendee without telling him about the transaction and the defendant disclosed that their father (Horidash) has gifted all his properties to him. The plaintiff thereafter obtained the certified copy of the deed of gift and filed the instant suit and the further case of the plaintiff is that the plaintiff and the defen­dant have been living in plot No.15 of Mazidia Mouza from life time of their father. The suit land is also being possessed by the plaintiff as he is the 50% owner of the 'Kha' schedule land men­tioned in the plaint, the said deed of gift created cloud on his title and hence the plaintiff brought the suit for necessary relief in the matter.<br/><br/>3. The defendant contested the suit by fil­ing written statements and denied all the material allegations made in the plaint and contended, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit is not maintainable in its present form and it is barred by limitation and that Haridas lived with him and the relationship between the plaintiff and Haridas was not at all good and that Haridas gifted all his properties to him by the registered deed No. 3028 dated 02.03.1987; that the plaintiff has filed the suit by making false statements and the defendant accordingly prayed for dis­missal of the suit.<br/><br/>4. The learned Assistant Judge, dismissed the suit and on appeal the same was allowed and the suit was remanded for retrial on the ground that the defendant has a case as it appears from Ext. G series that immediately after the alleged gift Ram Nath opened a separate Khatian after mutation. But the order sheets of the muta­tion proceeding was not available before the Assistant Judge to look into the matter whether in that proceeding  Ram Nath notified his brother or whether kept the matter concealed. If after calling for the record or by perusing certified copy, it could be gathered that the plaintiff was notified a decision as regards limitation and acquiescence could have been taken. It is further found by the Additional District Judge, that the very important and primary evidence as regard limitation, plaintiffs knowledge and bonafide of the signature of Haridas (father) on the disputed gift were not available and that would be lawful and equitable to send this suit back for retrial setting aside the decision and giving the parties an opportunity to produce those evidences before the trial Court to ensue complete justice. It is fur­ther found by the Additional District Judge that the plaintiff at one stage stated that he came to know about the disputed deed some 2 days before filing the suit and the Assistant Judge, rightly resolved that within such a short period no such suit could be brought. There is no comment on the gift of deed by the Additional District Judge as to its genuineness. However, on revision, the order of remand was set aside and the suit was dismissed.<br/><br/>5. Al-haj Giasuddin Ahmed, the learned Advocate appearing for the appel­lant, submits that Haridas Sarker, father of the plaintiff allegedly made the gift of his property in favour of his one son defen­dant No.1 depriving the other, the plaintiff which is not permitted under the law and the instant case, involves a question of law to great public importance as to whether a Hindu governed by Dayabhaga school of law in Bangladesh could transfer his entire property only to one son depriving his other son.<br/><br/>6. We have the privilege to go through the judgment passed by the learned Assistant Judge as well as that of Additional District Judge in appeal with reference to the judgement so passed by the learned Judge of the High Court Division in revision.<br/><br/>7. Before entering into details, we may be permitted to state that the trial Court (Assistant Judge) found to have consid­ered all the material facts relevant for disposal of the suit. As against this, the learned Additional District Judge-the Court of appeal set aside the judgment and decree so passed by the learned Assistant Judge on technical ground being persuad­ed by emotion. Be that as it may, it appears from the impugned judgment so passed by the learned Judge of the High Court Division in revision seems to us a practi­cal one who found to have discussed the matter from every angles. It may be men­tioned here that the learned Advocate for the appellant failed to point out any ille­gality or unsoundness of the findings of the learned Judge of the High Court Division in the matter of disposal of the revision.<br/><br/>8. However, it appears that the learned Advocate for the appellant, submits that Haridas Sarker,  father of the plaintiff allegedly made the gift of the entire prop­erties in favour of the son (defendant No. 1) depriving the other plaintiffs which is not permitted under the law and the instant case, he contends that involves a question of law to greater public impor­tance as to whether a Hindu governed by Dayabhaga school of law in Bangladesh could transfer his entire properties only to one son depriving his other sons.<br/><br/>9. Bivas Chandra Biswas, the learned Advocate for the respondent, submits that the findings and decisions as arrived at by the High Court Division deserves no inter­ference since the same has dealt with every aspect of the case. However, as regards the involvement of a question of law as alleged by the learned Advocate of the appellant as to whether a Hindu gov­erned by Dayabhaga School of law in Bangladesh could transfer his entire properties only to one son depriving his other sons is an emotional proposition having no basis of law so far it relates to Hindu Dayabhaga school of law in Bangladesh. In support of his submissions, he referred to Section 357 of Mulla's Hindu Law 18th Edition by Satyajeet A Desai, which deals with what properties may be dis­posed off by gift, which runs as follows:<br/>(1) *  *   *<br/>(2) * * * *<br/>(3) A father under Dayabhaga law, may by gift, dispose of the whole of his proper­ty, whether ancestral or self-acquired, sub­ject to the claims of those who are entitled to be maintained by him.<br/>The reason is that according to the Bengal School, 'where property is held by the father (as the head of the family), his issue have no legal claim upon him or the prop­erty except for their maintenance. He can dispose it off as he pleases, and they can­not require a partition. The sons have no ownership while the father is alive and free from defect. Upon his death, the prop­erty in the sons arises, and with it the right to a partition' (ss. 273, 275)3. A father under Mitakshara law has no such power over joint family property. He cannot dis­pose of it, not even his own interest there­in, by gift. In certain cases, however, he has a special power, by virtue of his posi­tion as father, to dispose off, by gift, a small portion of joint family property (ss. 225 and 226)." <br/><br/>10. We have gone through the aforesaid provision of law and reasons to believe that the same supported the interest of the defendant-respondent and the learned Advocate for the appellant failed to count­er act the same by producing any law/cus­toms so applicable to the Hindus residing in Bangladesh governed by Dayabhaga school of law.<br/><br/>11. Regard being had to the above facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the opinion that the appeal has got no merit and accordingly, the same is dis­missed without any order as to cost.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
