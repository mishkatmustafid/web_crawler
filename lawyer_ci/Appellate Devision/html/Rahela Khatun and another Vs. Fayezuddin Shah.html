Leave was granted to consider the question whether the High Court Division mis-directed itself in holding that additional evidence would only be allowed if the Court was not able to pronounce judgment without the same. In other words whether the High Court Division considered the provision of Order 41, rule 27 C.P.C. correctly.<br/><br/>3. The respondent filed Miscellaneous Case No. 17 of 1978, in the Court of Sub-ordinate Judge, Bogra, under section 96 of State Acquisition and Tenancy Act for pre-empting lands purchased by the appellants <em>vide</em> registered sale deed dated 17.4.75 from one Abiran Bibi. The respondent claimed that was a co-sharer to the transferred holding.<br/><br/>4. The appellants resisted the pre-emption proceeding on the ground that the vendor Abiran Bibi had earlier mutated r name and got the holding separated vide Mutation Case No. 82 (IX) of 1965-66. As such the respondent was no longer a co-sharer in the transferred holding.<br/><br/>5. The appellants in order to prove that the original jama had already been separated the pre-emptor also paid rents accordingly with the knowledge of the mutation case, called for Register II from the local Tahshil Office. The local Assistant Tahshilder O.P.W. 2. proved the relevant entries. The respondent, however, withheld his rent receipts alleging that he did not pay any rent after the preparation of the revisional record of rights.<br/><br/>6. The learned Subordinate Judge held that although the entries in the Register II showed payment of rents at reduced rate following; he mutation case, the entries, however, did not show that such rents were paid by the respondent with the knowledge of the muta­tion case. The learned Subordinate Judge allowed the pre-emption case.<br/><br/>7. Thereafter, the appellants filed Miscel­laneous Appeal No. 15 of 1981, in the Court of District Judge, Bogra and the same is pending for hearing. After filing the appeal, the appellants made search in the record room of the District Collectorate and found out the relevant duplicate carbon rent-receipts by which the respondent paid rents accordingly with the full knowledge of the mutation case. The appellants contended that the respondent withheld the original rent receipts at the time of trial falsely alleging that he did not pay any rent after the pre­paration of the revisional record of rights. The appellants thereafter filed an ap­plication under Order 41, rule 27 C.P.C. together with certified copies of the rent receipts of the pre-emptor respondent praying for taking them as additional evidence after re-calling the O.P.W. 2, the local Assistant Tahshilder.<br/>The learned Additional District Judge rejected the prayer in one sentence "the gro­und for taking additional evidence is not satisfactory," by his order dated 7.8.81<br/><br/>8. In revision, the High Court Division considered the provision of Order 41, rule 27 C. P.C. and observed as under:<br/><br/>"Additional evidence cannot be taken unless the court finds that there is some inherent defect or lacuna in the evidence for which the court will not be able to pronounce its judgment properly."<br/>9. The learned Single Judge took the view “it is purely discretion on the part of the Appellate Court to grant such an applica­tion for additional evidence, and the Court cannot allow to produce additional evidence to fill up the lacuna." Further, it was consi­dered that the Court is able to pronounce judgment without additional evidence.<br/><br/>10. Mr. M. Golam Rabbani, the learned Counsel, appearing for the appellants, placed before us the petition that was filed for addi­tional evidence. On perusal of the same it is clear that the appellants had given a challenge to the pre-emption proceeding on the ground that the jama had already been separated and the respondent was paying rents following the separation and mutation case. If it is estab­lished that there had been really separation of the jama then it is well settled that the pre­emption will not be allowed. The crux of the problem is that the appellants had found out the rent receipts in the Collectorate and obtained certified copies of the carbon rent receipts paid by the respondent. The appel­lants asked the Court to take this document as additional evidence which will bring the matter into sharp focus whether the jama had earlier been separated or not and the respon­dent, the pre-emptor, will have to face this challenge. But to deprive the appellants from proving this rent receipt of the respondent, which have been deliberately withheld by the respondent is to allow stealing a march by the respondent on the appellants. No Court ad­judicating issues between the litigants can allow doing this and Order 41, rule 27 precisely provides for such situation.<br/><br/>11. The Indian Supreme Court took the view that additional evidence may be allowed not only to enable the court "to pronounce judgment but also for any other substantial cause," which may include when court consi­ders in the interest of justice "that something remaining obscure should be filled up"(<em><strong>Venkataramiah vs. Seethamma. AIR 1963 SC 1526)</strong></em><br/><br/>12. Rule 27(1)(b) speaks of for any other substantial cause". The court should allow additional evidence when the respon­dent denies that he paid rent at a reduced rate, consequent upon the separation of the jama and when the appellants have found out the rent receipt which belies the assertion of the respondent, a case is made out for adducing additional evidence within the meaning of "substantial cause" because as the Indian Supreme Court observed "that something remaining obscure should be filled up.''<br/><br/>13. In this view of the matter, there is no hesitation in saying that the Courts below erred in law in rejecting the prayer for additional evidence as prayed by the appellants. The appeal itself is still pending before the Ap­pellate Court below. The appellants will now be allowed to adduce additional evidence as prayed for.<br/>In the result, therefore, this appeal is allowed. The order of the High Court Divi­sion is hereby set aside. The appellants are given the liberty to adduce additional evi­dence before the Appellate Court below. No order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
