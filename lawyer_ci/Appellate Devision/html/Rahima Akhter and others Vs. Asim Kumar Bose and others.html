In Ordinance No. 93 of 1976 power was given to the Government to dispose of the property and nothing was left for making the settlement that such property was to be preserved till conclusion of peace. Since the Government did not cancel the contract by declaring it against the public interest the contract is alive and the machinery has been provided by the Defence of Pakistan Ordinance namely, the preservation of jurisdiction of Civil Court (section 16).

No. 44 1981.)<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Judgment</strong></span></div><strong>                       </strong><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Badrul Haider Chowdhury.- </strong>This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and order of the High Court Division in F. A. No. 42 of 1981.<br/><br/>2. The predecessor of the appellants filed Title Suit No. 31 of 1977 in the 5th Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka for specific performance of contract stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that there was an agreement between S.M. Ismail on the one hand and Hemnalini Basu (the predecessor of respondents 1 and 2) on the other hand. The Bainapatra is dated 13.4.63. The stipulation was that the property will be sold to S.M. Ismail at a consideration of Tk. 35, 0007 Hemnalini received Tk. 27,400/- as advance and executed a bainapatra and delivered possession of the property. It was stipulated that Hemnalini would execute a registered deed of sale within 4 years and give the possession of the rest of the property at that time. Hemnalini died on 12.6.64 leaving respondent Asim Kumar Basu as her heir. The plaintiff’s case was that he approached Hemnalini during her life time for execution of the deed and after her death the plaintiff approached respondent No.1 but his request was not complied with. Thereafter the Defence of Pakistan Rules, 1965 was promulgated and the property had been vested to the Custodian of the Enemy Property. The plaintiff impleaded in this suit the Asstt Custodian of Enemy Property as defendant No. 2 and S.M. Ismail filed the suit on 8.1.70 being T.S. No. 2 of 1970 and the Assistant Custodian filed written statement on 29.4.70 and another additional written statement was filed on 10.7.72. Asim, respondent No. 1 also filed a written statement on 14.9.72.<br/><br/>3. The defence case was that there was no contract for sale between Hemnalini and S.M. Ismail and no bainapatra was executed by her and the Bainapatra was forged and fraudulent nor Ismail was given possession of the suit property though he trespassed in the suit property in August, 19-70. The suit property became enemy property and the Custodian had leased out to several persons on monthly rent and they were in possession.<br/><br/>4. In the meantime on 12.7.72 one Sova Rani filed application stating that she is one of the two daughters of Hemnalini Basu as such she, as an heir, inherited the estate of late Hemnalini. On court's order Sova Rani was added as the defendant in the suit as defendant No.3 but she did not file any written statement.<br/><br/>5. In compliance with the provisions of P.O. 142 of 1972 Government of Bangladesh was added as defendant No. 4 and it adopted written statement filed by the Assistant Custodian of Enemy Property.<br/><br/>6. The trial court decreed the suit holding that the Bainapatra was a genuine document and the appellants were in possession of the part of the suit property and the suit is maintainable inasmuch as heirs of Hemnalini and the Custodian were impleaded. Further the suit was not time-barred.<br/><br/>7. This decree was challenged in F.A. No. 44 of 1981 by Asim Kumar and Sova Rani. The Custodian, however, did not file any appeal and at the time of hearing the Assistant Custodian entered appearance and supported the appeal of the respondents 1 and 2.<br/><br/>8. The High Court Division considered that the question of possession was not material in this case and considered that the document in question namely Bainapatra was a genuine one. The High Court Division negatived the argument that the suit was time-barred and found the suit having been filed on 8.1.70, was within three years from the date of the Bainapatra and therefore the suit was not time-barred. The High Court Division repelled the contention as to the nature of the property whether it was stridhan or not inasmuch as there was no evidence as to when Hemnalini acquired the property. The learned Judges considered that prime question was that after vesting of the property in the custody of the Enemy Property, whether the defendant Nos. 1 and 3 could execute a kabala as heirs of Hemnalini.<br/><br/>9. The High Court Division further noticed that though assistant custodian did not challenge the decree by himself whether in view of the provision of Defence of Pakistan Rules and the General Notification No. 1199 dated 3.12.65 and paragraph 4 of the East Pakistan Enemy Property (Lands and Buildings) Administration and Disposal Order the contract could be specifically performed and then answered the query by observing:<br/>“All legal right and obligations that followed from the agreement in question were snapped.”<br/>Next the High Court Division considered "that such property could only be transferred with the approval of the Govt. but as the Government did not enter into any agreement with the plaintiff and the suit property being an enemy property vested in the Custodian of Enemy Property, the Government cannot be compelled by a decree of the court to perform <strong>t</strong>he contract which had become frustrated after the war broke out". In this view of the matter the appeal was allowed and the judgment and decree of the trial court were set aside.<br/><br/>10. The heirs of the plaintiff are the appellants before this Court: Mr. Khondker Mahbubuddin Ahmed canvassed that the High Court Division having found that the contract was genuine and the suit was not time-barred ought to have upheld the decree specially when the Custodian of the Enemy Property did not challenge the decree but by reasoning which is not tenable in law, the High Court Division had reversed the judgment and order of the trial court and set aside the decree.<br/><br/>11. Mr. Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed appearing for the respondent contended that in view of Defence of Pakistan Rules and the East Pakistan Enemy Property (Lands and Buildings) Disposal Order, 1966 such decree is inexecutable and the custodian cannot transfer any property. The High Court Division rightly set aside the decree inasmuch as the supervening impossibility had frustrated the contract.<br/><br/>12. We have heard able arguments of both sides and we shall presently consider the legal consequence from such contract. The contract has been found genuine. Question of nature of the property whether Stridhan or not does not merit consideration inasmuch as the issue was not raised before in the pleading and therefore the contention does not merit any consideration. The relevant provision of rule 182, as it stood on the promulgation on the 6th of September, 1965, was to the following effect;<br/>"<strong>182. Collection of debt of enemy firms and custody of property.-</strong>(1) With a view to preventing the payment of money to an enemy firm, and preserving enemy property in contemplation of arrangement to be made at the conclusion of peace, the Central Government may appoint a Custodian of Enemy Property for Pakistan and one or more Deputy Custodian or Assistant Custodian of Enemy Property for such local areas as may be prescribed and may by order-<br/>(a) * * *<br/>(b) Vest or provide for vesting in the prescribed Custodian such enemy property as may be prescribed.<br/>* * *<br/>This rule was amended on 2.11.65 wherein the word “management” in the sub-heading was substituted in place of the word "custody" and the expression "preserving enemy property in contemplation of arrangement to be made at the conclusion of peace" was replaced by an expression viz "<u>to provide for the administration and disposal by way of transfer or otherwise of enemy property or matters concerned therewith or incidental thereto."</u> (emphasis added).<br/>Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed argued that notwithstanding the amendment the Legislature's intendment seems to be the preservation of enemy property till conclusion of peace and the right, title and interest of the enemy was not sought to be extinguished in any way. Reliance was placed on a decision <em><strong>Benoy Bhusan Bardhan Vs. The Sub-Divisional Officer, Brahmanbaria &amp; another 30 DLR SC 139</strong>.</em> Mr. Ahmed argued that Hemnalini might have executed a bainapatra but the property having been vested in the custodian as enemy property the contract has become frustrated and the High Court Division rightly took the view in this factor.<br/><br/>13. Mr. Khondker Mahbubuddin Ahmed traced the history of this Legislation and contended that though in 1974 the Legislature passed two Ordinances, namely Ordinance IV of 1974 and Ordinance No. V of 1974, subsequently the Government acquired the power for disposal by Acts 92 and 93 of 1976 and the evolution of law was not traced in the case of <em><strong>Benoy Bhusan 30 DLR (SC) 139</strong></em> and as such the decision is not a good law.<br/><br/>14. President's Order No. 29 of, 1972 (dated 26th March, 1972) provided that all properties and assets which were vested in the Government of Pakistan or any officer appointed by such Government or were vested in or managed by any Board constituted by or under any law or in the former Government of East Pakistan shall be deemed to have been vested in the Government of Bangladesh on and from 26th day of March, 1971. The property thus vested in the Custodian, Enemy Property under the Defence of Pakistan Rules had now vested by operation of law in the Government of Bangladesh.<br/><br/>15. The suit was filed in 1970 and the plaintiff made the Custodian as defendant No. 2 and again made Government of Bangladesh also as defendant No. 4 upon promulgation of P.O. 142 of 1972 which stipulated that no suit for specific performance of contract could be instituted without impleading the Govt. which is a necessary party.<br/><br/>16. The Enemy Property (Continuance of Emergency Provisions) (Repeal) Ordinance 1974, Ordinance No. IV of 1974 was promulgated on 23.3.74 and it repealed the Enemy Property (Continuance of Emergency Provision) Ordinance No.1 of 1969 and the saving section 3 reads as follows:<br/>"<strong>3. Saving.-</strong>(1) notwithstanding the repeal of said Ordinance and anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, on such repeal-(a)all enemy property vested in the Custodian of Enemy Property appointed under the provisions of the Defence of Pakistan Rules continued in force by the said Ordinance shall vest in the Government.<br/>(b) All enemy firms the trade or business of which was being carried on by any person or Board authorised under the provisions of the Defence of Pakistan Rules continued in force by the said Ordinance shall vest in the Government.<br/>Explanation (i) The terms "Enemy Property" and "Enemy firms" used in this section shall be deemed to have the same meaning as assigned to those terms in the Defence of Pakistan Rules continued in force by the said Ordinance,<br/>(ii) In this sub-section, "Custodian of Enemy Property" includes an Additional Custodian of Enemy Property, a Deputy Custodian of Enemy Property and an Assistant Custodian of Enemy Property appointed under the Defence of Pakistan Rules continued in force by the said ordinance."<br/>By this Ordinance, therefore, the property vested unmistakably in the Government. In passing it may be noticed that Ordinance No.I of 1969 purported to continue certain provisions of the Defence of Pakistan Rules and the Ordinance ceased to have effect.<br/><br/>17. Rule 182 was also continued in force. This was repealed by Ordinance IV of 1974 as mentioned above. Therefore, the position emerges that the Enemy Property which previously vested in the Custodian or Assistant Custodian now vested by section 3 in the Government notwithstanding repeal of Ordinance I of 1969.<br/><br/>18. On the same day i.e. on 22.3.74 another Ordinance was promulgated namely, the Vested and Non-Resident Property Administration Ordinance, 1974 being Ordinance V of 1974 and vested property was defined as "any property which has vested in the Government under section 3(1)of the Enemy Property(Continuance of Emergency Provision) (Repeal) Ordinance, 1974 (Ordinance IV of 1974). It provided in Part III "that the vested property shall be under the charge of a Committee and the Committee shall take such measures as may be necessary for the good management and protection of such property for the assertion of title thereto." It provided "that the Committee shall not be entitled to transfer except by monthly or annual lease any vested property.”Similar provision was made in Part V insofar as non-resident property is concerned but in section 10 a non-resident has been given a right to dispose of such property by exchange or gift, subject to certain condition and upon disposition the property shall cease to vest in the Committee (Section 10, sub-section 3). Thus for the first time a legislative change has taken place and a non-resident had also been given a right as to its property to dispose of his property. This Ordinance No. V was converted into an Act being Act XLVI of 1974.19. Next on 27.11.76 the Vested and Non-Resident Property (Administration) (Repeal) Ordinance, 1976 (Ordinance, No. 92 of 1976) was promulgated. It repealed the Vested and Non-Resident Property Administration Act, 1974 (Act XLVI of 1974).<br/><br/>20. On the same day the Enemy Property Continuance and Emergency Provision (Repeal) (Amendment) Ordinance, 1976 being Ordinance 93 of 1976 was promulgated with retrospective effect from 23rd March, 1974. It amended section 3 of the Enemy Property (Continuance of Emergency Provisions) (Repeal) Act of 1974. Act XLV of 1974 which was previously Ordinance No. IV of 1974. It may be noted that enactment repealed the Ordinance No.1 of 1969 and by section 3 vested the property in the Government which earlier vested in the Custodian and now by Ordinance 93 of 1976 in further amendment section 3 of Act XLV of 1974 and added-<br/>"and shall be administered, controlled, nagged and disposed of by transfer or otherwise by the Government or any such officer or authority as the Government may direct".<br/>By this amendment of section 3 of Act XLV of 1974 the entire complexion was changed and power was given for disposal or transfer to the Government vide section 2 of Ordinance 93 of 1976.<br/><br/>21. The legislative process now becomes clear that when initially the Defence of Pakistan Rules attended for the preservation of the property till conclusion of peace the Government changed the policy as early as on 2.11.65 and deleted the portion "Preserving Enemy Property in contemplation of arrangement to be made at the conclusion of peace," and replaced it by new provision "to provide for the administration and disposal by way of transfer connected therewith or incidentally thereto". Subsequently by P.O. 29 of 1972 such property was vested in the Govt. of Bangladesh and though under the Ordinance Nos. 4 &amp; 5 of 1974 the property was kept in charge of the Committee and the non-resident could dispose of his property subject to the approval of the Committee, this process was done away with in 1976 when the Government took power for transfer and disposal of such property.<br/><br/>22. In this legal background, this is too late say that the Government has no power of transfer and disposal of the Enemy Property in pursuance of direction of court. From the above analysis of the legal position it is clear that the property is now vested in the Government and the Assistant Custodian has no claim in respect of such property. The High Court Division had fallen into an error in its conclusion when it says:<br/>"Custodian's power to transfer enemy property could only be exercised with the approval of the Government. As the Government had not entered into any agreement with the plaintiff and the suit property being an enemy property vested in the Custodian of enemy property the Government cannot be compelled by a decree of the Court to perform the contract which had become frustrated after the war broke out between the country where the property was situated and the enemy country where the owner or owners were permanently residing."<br/>With respect, the reason is fallacious in the setting of legal position. The Custodian is no more in control and management of the property. It is the Government since 1976. Plaintiff made the Government a party to the suit. He is seeking to enforce the contract which he entered into with Hemnalini. She having died her sons and daughters being residents of enemy country, the property was taken over as enemy property by the Custodian. When the suit was filed in 1970 the property was vested in the Custodian no doubt but by the provision of P, O. No. 29 of 1972 this had vested in the Government.<br/><br/>23. In 1974 the non-resident could dispose of his property with the permission of the Committee. The contractual power of non-resident was not taken away. The only condition was that has to be done subject to the approval of the Committee.<br/><br/>24. In 1976 this Committee had been done away with and it is only Govt. which appeared in the scene as a sole authority and got power of disposal and transfer by Ordinance 93 of 1976.<br/><br/>25. It is not correct to say that the agreement had been frustrated. The agreement was very much alive and power of transfer was available even with Custodian subject to certain condition and this power was vested in the Committee and the non­resident was given the right to transfer his property with the approval of the Committee and thereafter Government took up the power of control and management and disposal and transfer. When this power is available there is no reason to hold that the contract entered into by Hemnalini could not be specifically performed. If it had been the position that the contract should not be enforced in public interest the Government would have said so and specific power was available to the Government in Rules 176 and 178 of the Defence of Pakistan Rules for cancelling such contract in public interest. That was not done nor such position was taken by the Government. In this view of the matter, therefore, the opinion of the High Court Division appears to be in error.<br/><br/>26. Now the question of Benoy Bhusan, it is submitted, that exposition of law that has been made in that decision was not strictly necessary for the disposal of that case. In that case a notice was served upon the appellant that he was in continuous occupation of certain property without any document which belonged to Indian nationals and to show cause why the said property should not be declared as enemy property. The appellant took the stand that a portion of property which stood in the name of Paresh Chandra Bardhan was acquired on the basis of valid document and a portion of the property standing in the name of Chittotosh Bardhan were debuttor property and the appellant being the elder member of the family managed the said property for the Sheba Puja etc. and the remaining property were ejmali properties and he being a co-sharer was in lawful possession of such property.<br/><br/>27. The Sub-Divisional Officer, Brahmanbaria repelled the contention of the appellant and declared the property as enemy property and recommended the lease of the said land to other persons.<br/><br/>28. The appellant challenged the order before the High Court in writ jurisdiction and the learned Judges of the High Court Division disposed of by the judgment on 1.12.69 holding that the respondents were authorised to exercise necessary powers for taking possession of the disputed land upon partition which were enemy properties and directed the Custodian to look into the court's order properly and leave out the legitimate share of the appellant in the properties before taking possession of the shares of Indian nationals.<br/><br/>29. The appellant then obtained special leave which was granted by the Supreme Court of Pakistan to consider the question whether the Sub-Divisional Officer was competent to exercise the power of the Assistant Custodian and whether the Custodian could take possession of any ejmali land of which the appellant was in possession as a co-sharer without partition of the said land.<br/><br/>30. In this setting of facts the Appellate Division came to the conclusion that as a co-owner of an undivided share of the joint land has his right, title and interest" in every grain of soil constituting the joint land and cannot therefore be said to be in unlawful possession of such land, even if he is in exclusive possession thereof" and it was further held that the Custodian of Enemy Property representing the share of enemy owner cannot go into possession of the joint land by dispossessing the co-sharer in possession of the said land without partitioning the same according to law. In this view of the matter the appeal was allowed and the impugned orders were declared to have been taken without lawful authority.<br/><br/>31. In passing, in the judgment considerable portion was devoted as to the nature of rule 182 and the legal consequences therefrom. The entire judgment was based upon a philosophy in paragraph 21 of the judgment which reads as follows:<br/>"21. The predominant idea behind taking over and management of the enemy property under these Emergency Legislations seems to have been the prevention of certain acts which might be prejudicial to the war efforts of the Government of Pakistan and the preservation of the said properties during the continuance of the war. It seems to have been never in the contemplation of the Government of the country to acquire for itself any beneficial interest in the properties of an individual enemy owner under the said provisions. But to protect and manage the properties, so that the rightful owners could get back their properties on the conclusion of peace".<br/><br/>32. It was observed that right, title and interest was not sought to be extinguished in any way but were purported to be placed instead in temporary hibernation so to say during the continuance of the emergency (para 20). It was concluded that -<br/>"subsisting interest of the enemy owner is high lighted by the provision of clause (iv) of paragraph 3 which authorised the Custodian concerned to incur expenditure for the maintenance of the individual enemy owner or his family (para 20),"<br/>With respect this was the misreading of law itself. Paragraph (iv) of section 3 reads as under;<br/>"(iv) The Custodian, where the enemy property belongs to an individual enemy subject or any individual resident in enemy territory may incur such expenditure out of the income of the property as he considers necessary or expedient for the <u>maintenance of individual or of his family in Pakistan." </u>(emphasis added).<br/>The Custodian will spend money for the maintenance of individuals or his family in Pakistan. He is not to spend money for the maintenance of individual enemy subject, who is resident of enemy country. The law was considered in a particular perspective and this is evident from another paragraph where it is said:<br/>"The main object of the said rule does not appear to have been affected in any way by such amendment as the relevant provisions of the Enemy Property (Custody and Administration) Order, 1965 which declared and specified the rights of the Custodian in whom the properties of an enemy had vested did not undergo any alteration whatsoever."<br/>The Defence of Pakistan Rules promulgated in pursuance of the Defence of Pakistan Ordinance are in the nature of subordinate legislation. It is well settled that subordinate legislation cannot override the provision of the parent Legislation. The initial difference between subordinate legislation and the Statute lies in the fact that a subordinate law making object is bound by the terms and its gated or derived authority and courts of law as a rule will not give effect to the rules etc. made unless satisfied that all the conditions precedent to making of the rules have been led. Even in paragraph 3(1) it is stated that the Custodian shall have all the rights, powers, duties and liabilities of the owner of such property.<br/><br/>33. Mr. Ishtiaq Ahmed could not deny that the obligation of the owner Hemnalini had devolved upon the Custodian when her property was vested in. There is no law which bars the Custodian for executing then &amp; executing the document which the owner <u>had she been alive would have to do so in pursuance of the decree of court.</u><br/><br/>34. Repeated emphasis was given in the judgment of Benoy Bhusan [30 DLR (SC) 139] that" these were essentially temporary measures for the management and protection of properties.”(para 20) and notwithstanding the amendment of 2.11.65 which radically altered the law the judgment rests primarily on the expression "preserving Enemy Property in contemplation of arrangement to be made at the conclusion of the peace."<br/><br/>35. This expression was borrowed from the English enactment. Section 7 of Trading with Enemy Act, 1939. That section so far as is relevant provides as under:<br/>"With a view to preventing the payment of money to enemies and of preserving enemy property in contemplation of arrangements to be made at the conclusion of peace."<br/>The argument of the defendant in the case of <em><strong>RJ. Reuter Co. Ltd. Vs. Ferd Mulhens 1953 All E.R. 1160</strong></em> centred on the opening word and it was contended 'that the, section contemplated for preserving the Enemy Property in contemplation of arrangement to be made at the conclusion of peace, and the argument was that the purported transfer of shares and the selling of trade mark were not contemplated by the section. The question before the court was whether it conferred the power of sale or transfer.<br/><br/>36. The Court of Appeal repelled the contention and concluded that the opening words of the section ought not to have treated as having restricted effect for which Counsel for the defendant contended. It was observed that the Trading with the Enemy (Amendment) Act, 1914 contained a preamble substantially in the same form as the opening words of section 7 of the Act of 1939. In <strong><em>Re Munster,</em></strong> <strong>Russel J.</strong> explained the expression and said <strong><em>(1920) Ch. 278</em></strong>:<br/>"In my judgment the Act of 1914 does not depart from these principles or involve confiscation. Under its provisions, the enemy is deprived of beneficial ownership during the war. And the Custodian after the termination of the war is bound to deal with it in such manner as his Majesty (keeping no doubt, in view the arrangements made at the conclusion of peace) may by Order in Council direct...The phraseology used in the preamble and in section 5 establishes in my judgment that, pending its disposition by Order in Council after the determination of the war, the property is removed from the control and from the beneficial ownership of the enemy. At the <u>termination of the war fresh consideration will arise: and whether the enemy will recover, and to what extent he will recover, the beneficial ownership will</u> depend upon the arrangements made at the conclusion of peace... and upon the terms of any Order in Council, made, 1 doubt not, with those arrangements in view under section 5".(emphasis added.)<br/><strong>Birkett LJ. </strong>observed in <em><strong>1953 All E.R. (2) page 1182</strong></em><strong>:</strong><br/>"when the transfer of the trade marks was made in June, 1951, it was made in the light of the provisions of the Act of 1949 and the statutory instrument, and the "arrangement to be made .at the conclusion of peace referred to in Section 7 of the Act of 1939 could never be such arrangements as would contemplate the handing back of the enemy property to German nationals."<br/><strong>Romer LJ. </strong>observed at page 1184:<br/>"Throughout the war and down to the date of the assignment the defendants possessed no legal rights in relation either to the registered trade marks or in relation to the good will of the business which they had formerly carried on here. All that the defendants did possess was the suspended beneficial interest to which 1 have already referred and if the Custodian had the power to sell the trade marks and good will, as in my judgment, he had even, this somewhat shadowy interest was automatically destroyed by the exercise of that power and nothing survived to the defendants."<br/>That was the law in England on the phraseology that "the arrangement would be made, at the conclusion of peace." But in our law Rule 182 was amended on 2.11.65 and the expression "preserving the enemy property in contemplation of arrangement to be made at the conclusion of peace" "was replaced by new expression" and to provide for the Administration and disposal by <u>way of</u> <u>transfer or otherwise of enemy property or matter concerned therewith</u> or incidental thereto, (emphasis added).<br/><br/>37. With this amendment the entire complexion was changed. The emphasis was no more for preservation of enemy property but it was for disposal by way of transfer. In the words of <strong>Romer L.J.</strong> whatever shadowy interest the defendant had that was automatically destroyed by the exercise of the powers by the Custodian and nothing survived to the defendants. The decision in Benoy Bhusan's case unfortunately having noticed the amendment in rule 182 observed-"the main object of the said rule does not appear to have been affected in any way by such amendment as the relevant provision of the Enemy Property (Custody and Administration) Order, 1965 which declared and specified right of the Custodian in whom the properties of any enemy had vested did not undergo any alteration whatsoever", to say the least, with respect, is misreading of the law itself. A case is an authority for the principle laid down in the facts and circumstances of that case and in Benoy Bhusan's case the question was whether the Custodian could take possession of the share of the enemy in a property without effecting partition. While in this judgment no opinion is expressed on the decision in <em><strong>Benoy Bhusan (30 DLR (S.C) 139</strong></em>) on its facts of that case the exposition of law detailed from paragraphs 11 to 21 do not commend to us as correct exposition of law namely Defence of Pakistan Rules read with paragraph 4(7) of the Enemy Property (Custody and Registration) Order, 1965 and Act Nos. 45, 46 of 1974 and Ordinance Nos. 92 and 93 of 1976.<br/><br/>38. Even in England it was held that whatever shadowy interest left for the defendant was; automatically destroyed by the exercise of that power conferred by section 7 and nothing survived to the defendants. How an argument could be built up in view of the amendment dated 2.11.65 to say "that it seems to have been never in contemplation of the Government of the country to acquire for itself any beneficial interest of the property of an individual enemy owner under the said provision, but to project and manage the property so that owners get back their properties at the conclusion of peace" appears to be unfounded in law inasmuch as there was no contemplation of any arrangement to be made at the conclusion of peace wheres by amendment it provided for the admission, disposal and by way of transfer or otherwise the enemy property.<br/><br/>39. In this view of the matter the argument of respondent that the Custodian could not execute kabala in question in pursuance of the decree of performance of the contract does not hold good. The High Court Division unfortunately had into this very error and took the view that neither could the Custodian execute the document nor could the Government do so inasmuch as the Government was not party to the contract.<br/><br/>40. The contract was made by Hemnalini and she died within a year of the agreement. Plaintiff was asking for the kabala and since the property became enemy property the defendants, the heirs of Hemnalini could not execute, kabala. It was only the Custodian who could do it inasmuch as he stepped into the shoes of the owner itself with the power of transfer available to him on and from 2.1.65 which was conferred by amendment itself.<br/><br/>41. The subsequent legislations were not noticed in the case of <em><strong>Benoy Bhusan in 30 DLR at page 139.</strong></em> Neither Ordinance I of 1969 was noticed which continued rule 182 nor P.O.29 of 1972 was policed which vested such property in the Government Further the Ordinance IV of 1974 and V of 1974 which were repealed and re-enacted being Act Nos. 45 and 46 of 1974 when a non resident could dispose of his property with the approval of the Committee nor Ord. Nos. 92 and 93 of the 1976 which repealed Act 45 and 46 of 1974were considered in Benoy Bhusan.<br/><br/>42. In Act 93 of 1976 power was given to the Government to dispose of the property and nothing was left for making the settlement that such property was to be preserved till conclusion of peace. As has been noticed in <em><strong>R.J. Reuter Co. Ltd. Fred Mulhens, All England Report,1953 volume II page 1160</strong></em> that even such expression that arrangement to be made at the conclusion of peace, it could never be "such arrangement as to the contemplating giving back of this enemy property to German national". It is for the legislature to decide as to what is to be done with such property at the conclusion of peace but not for the court.<br/><br/>43. To opine that such legislation intended "to protect and manage the property so that the original owners could get back their properties at the conclusion of peace" is to read something in law which is not there and especially in view of the amendment dated 2.11.65. The opinion is that such conclusion is not warranted by law.<br/><br/>44. In view of the above analysis of the legal position there is no hesitation in saying that since the Government did not cancel the contract by declaring it against the public interest the contract is alive and the machinery has been provided by the Defence of Pakistan Ordinance namely, the preservation of jurisdiction of Civil Court (section 16). The Civil Court had exercised its jurisdiction and passed the decree and the Custodian who stepped into the shoes of the original owner e.g. Hemnalini has power to transfer this property by way of executing kabala. Whatever little right that was left for the non-resident the subsequent legislation clarified the point that the Government had power to transfer or disposal of such property vide Act 93 of 1976. If the Government had power of transfer, as provided by the Act, the next question is what prevents the Government to execute the document in pursuance of a decree of specific performance of contract. Mr. Ishtiaq Ahmed could not lay his hand on any such law.<br/><br/>45. In the result, therefore, appeal is allowed. Judgment and order of the High Court Division are set aside and those of the trial court restored, and the plaintiff gets the Kabala in pursuance of the decree of the trial court. There will be no order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
