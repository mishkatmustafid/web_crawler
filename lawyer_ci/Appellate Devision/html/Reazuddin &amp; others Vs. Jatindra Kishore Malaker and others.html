Masud J. — </strong>This appeal by special leave is directed against the judg­ment and order dated 22.6.83, passed by the High Court Division, Dhaka Bench, in Civil Revision Case No.150 of 1980.<br/><br/>2. Rajab Ali and Ajitullah, predecessors of the present appellants filed Miscellaneous Case No. 36 of 1974, in the Court of Munsif, Sherpur, for correction of the record of right under section 143A of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act.<br/><br/>3. This case, in brief, was that the suit land measuring 65 acres originally belonged to "Deity Jagannath Dev Bigraha and was recorded in the name of Shebait Haridas Bairagi. After the death of Haridas Bairagi the right of Shahaitship devolved upon his wife, Ishwar Mani Baisnavi, who transferred the said right to her adopted daughter Nandarani Baisnavi under a registered Arpannama dated 23.2.43.Thereafter Nandarani settled the case land in favour of Rajab Ali and Ajitullah by a registered Kabuliyat dated 8.5.46.<br/>The appellants asserted possession on the strength of the aforesaid kabuliyat and contend that the case land has been wrongly recorded during the R.O.R. operation in the names of the respondents.<br/><br/>4. Respondents 1 and 2 contested the case by filing a joint written objection denying the material allegations of the appellants. Their case was that Ishwar Moni was not the wife of Haridas and Nandarani was not the adopted daughter of Ishwar Moni and she had no right to settle the case land as Shebait in favour of the predecessor of the appellants. It was contended that the predecessors of the appellants and after them the appellants were bargadars under the Deity Jagannath Dev Bigraha but they stopped delivering the crops to the deity.<br/>It was further contended that after the death of Haridas Bairagi, the respondents and their predecessors managed the affairs of the deity as <em>defacto</em> Shebait and the case land was correctly recorded in the name of the Deity represented by the <em>defacto</em> Shebaits.<br/>The learned Munsif allowed the applica­tion holding that the appellants have been possessing the land by way of adverse hostile possession for more than 12 years and as such they have acquired a good right, title and interest in the case land.<br/><br/>5. On appeal, the learned Subordinate Judge, Mymensingh, affirmed the decision of the trial Court observing that whatever may be the defect with the Exts.1-2, the appel­lants have been possessing the case land for more than 30 years in the capacity of Korfa tenants on the strength of Ext. 2 and they being in possession of the case land at the time of preparation of the record of right their names and not that of the respondents should have been recorded in the record of right.<br/><br/>6. Against the aforesaid decision of the learned Subordinate Judge, the respondents filed a revisional application before the High Court Division, Dhaka Bench, and obtained a rule which was ultimately made absolute. A Single Judge of the Dhaka Bench set aside the judgments and orders of the Courts below and dismissed the miscellaneous case filed under section, 143A of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act.<br/>Leave was granted by this Court to con­sider whether the learned Judge of the High Court Division correctly interfered with the lower appellate Court's order confirming the trial Court's order for correction of the records in favour of the persons in possession.<br/><br/>7. Mr. Fazlul Karim, the learned Counsel, appearing for the appellants argues that the learned Judge of the High Court Division committed an error of law by entering into a complicated question of title in a case which is to be decided solely on the question of possession. The learned Counsel referred to the observation of the learned Judge to the effect that Kabuliyat Ext. 2 did not confer any title to the appellant.<br/><br/>8. It was also argued that the learned Judge was wrong in holding that the appellants did not satisfy the legal requirement as de­manded by section 143A of the State Acquisi­tion and Tenancy Act or that the case was bad for defect of parties.<br/><br/>9. Mr. Santi Ranjan Karmakar, the learn­ed Advocate-on-record, appearing for the respondents, however, argues that the learned Judge of the High Court Division has rightly interfered with the concurrent decisions of the Courts below, which misconceived the provi­sion of Order 1, rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure and which further failed to notice that the requirement of section 143A of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act was not complied with.<br/>The learned fudge of the High Court Divi­sion did not reverse the finding of the Courts below that the appellants were in possession of the case land, when the disputed record was prepared.<br/><br/>10. The High Court Division reversed the decision of the Courts below with the observation that the Courts below traveled beyond the jurisdiction vested in them under section 143A of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act in deciding the question of title. There is no basis for such observation, while considering the claim of the contending parties, the learned Sub­ordinate Judge incidentally entered into the question of title but decided the case on the basis of possession.<br/>His positive finding is that the appel­lants entered into possession of case land on the basis of Ext. 2, kabuliyat as far back as in 1946 and they have excl­usively possessed the case land for more than 30 years. On such finding of possession, he affirmed the decision of the learned Munsif, but the learned Judge of the High Court Division reversed the decision of the lower Appellate Court without reversing the finding of possession made by the Courts below.<br/><br/>11. As regards defect of parties the Shebait having been brought on record, the learned Judge of the High Court Division was not justified in holding that the case should have been dismissed for not making the deity a party in the suit. He was also not justified in entering into the compl­icated question of title by making the observa­tion that the kabuliyat Ext. 2 did not confer any title to the appellants.<br/><br/>12. The learned Subordinate Judge has given cogent reasons for his finding and he committed no illegality in observing that Exts.1 and 2, certified copies of the registered Arpannama and the kabuliyat, were in existence for more than 30 years on the basis of which the present appellants claim their interest in the disputed land, whereas the present respondents could not produce anything except disputed record of right to show that they were-Shebait of the debottar estate. The Subordinate Judge rightly obser­ved that whether Iswar Moni was the wife of Haridas and whether Nandarani had acquired right of Shebait on the basis of Arpannama executed by Iswar Moni, are questions which cannot be determined in a case under section 143A of the State Acqui­sition and Tenancy Act.<br/><br/>13. The aforesaid observation was made incidentally while considering the main ques­tion of possession of the parties. As regards continuous possession of the appellants in the case land even the respondents admitted the same although they contended that the possession was as that of bargader. They, however, failed to prove the story of barga cultivation.<br/><br/>14. It is well settled that the material consideration in a case under section 143A of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act is the question of possession. Whatever may be the defect in title, if it is found that the appellants have been possessing the case land when the record of right was prepared, they are entitled to have   their names recorded.<br/><br/>15. Since the final Court of fact on consideration of evidence  found the appellants in continuous possession of the land for 30 years, the order allowing the appli­cation under section 143A of the State Acqui­sition and Tenancy Act for inclusion of the  names of the appellants in the record of right  has been correctly passed and  the learned Judge of the High Court Division was not Justified, in interfering with the said decision on grounds which are not to be taken into consideration in a case under section I43A of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act.<br/><br/>In the result the appeal is allowed. The order of the High Court Division is set aside and that of the lower Appellate Court is restored.<br/>There will no order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
