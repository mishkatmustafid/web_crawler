There was no pleading of the defendants as to acquisition or claim of title in the land in suit by adverse possession. The appellate Court considered the aforesaid contention of the defendants and in the background of the materials on record held that papers i.e. Ext.C. Ext.D and the Exts. B-B(2) series have not given rise to any claim of adverse possession by the defendants since the admitted position is that R.S. and P.S. record of rights stand in the name of Mela Committee and the Ext.D and B series are the papers subsequent to the dis­possession of the plaintiff from the land in suit by the defendants and inspite of the fact stated in Ext. C the land was recorded in the name of the Mela Committee and that in Ext. C name of the defendants do not appear and that in Miscellaneous Case No.95 wherein order was made on 25.11.1961 (Ext.C) the defendants were not parties. On the top of everything no evidence was lead from the side of defen­dants to establish the case of acquisition of title in the land in suit by adverse posses­sion. It has also been submitted from the side of the appellants that in case decree is passed in the suits that would violate the provision of Rule 9 of Order 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The submission so made is of no merit since description of the land in suit as given in the schedule is quite sufficient to identify the same both by referring to the boundary as well as by referring to the survey plot number.                                                                                                                                           … (16)</strong></div> <br/><strong>Lawyers Involved:</strong><br/><em>Abdul Quayum, Senior Advocate, instructed by A.K.M.

Ruhul Amin J.-</strong> These appeals by the defendants of the respective suits, by leave, are against the judgment dated April 9, 1997 in Civil Revision No.7556 (heard along with Civil Revision Nos.7557 and 7558 of 1991) discharging the Rules obtained against the judgment and decree dated July 28, 1991 of the 2nd Court of Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Chittagong in Other Appeal Nos.30, 31 and 32 of 1986 allow­ing the same and thereupon decreeing the suit upon reversing the judgment and decree dated December 21, 1985 of the Court of Munsif (now Assistant Judge), Sitakunda, Chittagong in Other Class Suit Nos.157, 158 and 230 of 1984 (previously numbered 173, 174 and 175 of 1973 respectively) dismissing the same.<br/><br/>2. The suits were filed seeking declaration of title in respect of 30 decimals of land of R.S. Plot No.792 listed in R.S. Khatian No.1700 described in schedule 'Ka' to the plaint and recovery of khas possession of different quantity of land (part of the land described in schedule 'Ka' to the plaint) described in the schedule 'Kha' attached to the plaint of the aforementioned respec­tive suits and for <em>mesne</em> profit.<br/><br/>3. The plaintiff, Sitakunda Chandra Nath Chatuspaty Tole (the Tale) filed the suit stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the land in suit belonged to Sitakunda Mela Committee, that the plaintiff applied for land to the Sitakunda Mela Committee and the Sub-Divisional Officer on behalf of the Mela Committee gifted the land in suit by the deed of gift dated January 15, 1963 and handed over possession of the land so gift­ed to the plaintiff and since then the plain­tiff possessed the same by constructing 'kacha' huts and let out the same to differ­ent persons on monthly rent basis, that during war of liberation 'kacha' huts were burned by the Pakistani Army and conse­quent thereupon the land in suit had fallen vacant  and taking advantage  thereof defendant No.1 of Other Suit No.157 of 1984, defendant No.1 of Other Suit No.158 of 1984 and defendant Nos.1-4 of Other Suit No. 230 of 1984 entered upon the land and constructed huts in January, 1973 and the said defendants let out the huts so constructed by them to the other defendants of the respective suits. It is also the case of the plaintiff that it requested the defendants to hand over vacant posses­sion of the land in suit but they did not pay any heed to that and as such the plaintiff was constrained to file the suit.<br/><br/>4. It is also the case of the plaintiff that it has leased out the land other then the land described in the 'Kha' schedule to others who have been described as tenant-defen­dants on monthly rent basis and at the time of P.S. survey instead of recording the land in suit in the name of the plaintiff, the record has been wrongly prepared in the name of some other persons who had no right, title and interest in the land in suit.<br/><br/>5. The suit was contested by the principle defendant/defendants by filing written statement denying the material averments made in the plaint and stating, inter alia, that the land in suit was never the land of the Sitakunda Mela Committee and the same belonged to C.S. recorded tenants Elahi Boksha and Mowla Boksha and the land being full of jungle and bushes the C.S. recorded tenants abandoned the land and in that state of the matter the defen­dants upon cleaning the jungle and bushes made the land usable and constructed huts and started business therein about 35/40 years back, that the story of the plaintiff that the defendants dispossessed it is not true. It was also the case of the defendants that the land in suit was the khas land and thereupon the defendants entered into the land upon cleaning the jungle and bushes and possessing the land described in the 'Kha' schedule of the plaint of the respec­tive suits upon paying rent to the revenue department. It was also the plea of the defendants that the land of both the sched­ules claimed by the plaintiff is unspecified and unidentifiable.<br/><br/>6. The trial Court dismissed the suit on the finding that the land described in the deed of gift Ext.2 and the land described in the schedule attached to the plaint is not the same and the land of the deed of gift is the land other than the land in suit, that there is no averments in the plaint nor it has been proved from which portion of the land in suit plaintiff has been dispos­sessed, that at the time of P.S. survey in connection with the preparation of the Khatian Miscellaneous Case No.95 dated 25.11.1961 was initiated and from the order-sheet (Ext. c) of the said Miscellaneous case, it is seen that there was a local inquiry and at that time defen­dants were found in possession of the land in question, that the defendants are in pos­session of the land in suit for more then 40 years and the plaintiff has never possessed the land in suit on the basis of deed of gift and plaintiff's story of possession in and dispossession from the land in suit is not true, that it is the case of the plaintiff that the defendants dispossessed the plaintiff in 1973 but the plaintiff filed the suit on September 28,1983 and as such plaintiff's claim for recovery of possession is barred by limitation, that the suit filed by the plaintiff is not maintainable as there was no cause of action to file the same, that the plaintiff failed to prove his case.<br/><br/>7. The plaintiff went on appeal. The appel­late Court reversed the judgment and decree of the trial Court on the finding that Ext.1-R.S. khatian shows that the land in suit was recorded in the name of Sitakunda Mela Committee represented by the Sub-Divisional Officer, Sadar, Chittagong and the superior landlord was Government of India (ভারত সম্রাট) and the land of the Ext.1, the R.S. khatian was rent free, that although defendants claimed that the land in suit belonged to C.S. recorded tenants Elahi Boksha and Mowla Boksha but the defendants are not claiming the land either as the heirs of the said two per­sons or as the settlement holders from the said persons and the defendants are claim­ing the land on the basis of Ext. D- B.S. khatian, that the plaintiff has filed Ext.4(b) to show that they are possessing the other portion of the land through the tenants, that the plaintiff has filed Exts.4(a) and (b), Exts.5(ka), order in other Execution Case No.32 of 1984, Ext.6 decree in Title Suit No.256 of 1981 and the order dated 11.1.1983 passed in Title Suit No.256 of 1981 in support of its title and possession in the land in suit, that defendants filed mutilated and torn copy of the C.S. পর্চা and the rent receipt- Exts. B-B(2) shows pay­ment of rent in July, 1975, March 1978, and May 1983, but of the said rent receipts, rent receipt of July, 1975 is erased, that the defendants have filed the order dated 25.11.1961 (Ext.C) passed in Miscellaneous Case Np.95 in support of their claim of possession in the land in suit, that on perusal of the documents filed by the parties it is seen that the plaintiff got the land in suit from the R.S. recorded tenant by the deed of gift and thereupon having had got the possession of the gift­ed land, possessed the same by letting out to the tenants and the huts in the land in suit were burned in 1971 finds support from the indirect admission of the wit­nesses examined by the defendants, that defendants failed to prove that they are in possession of the land for long time and thereupon acquired title in the land in suit by adverse possession, that there is no evi­dence from the side of the defendants that they got the land from the C.S. recorded tenants Elahi Boksha and Mowla Boksha , that by the B.S. পর্চা defendants have not acquired any title in the land in suit, that B.S. khatian No.700/8 was prepared in the name of Sitakunda Mela Committee and the plot mentioned therein is 792 compris­ing 65 decimals of land and out of that plaintiff got 30 decimals of land by gift, that because of Ext. D (B.S.পর্চা) title of the plaintiff can not be ignored or rejected since in the C.S. record Government of India was the superior landlord and the land of plot No.792 listed in the said R.S. khatian was possessed by the Mela Committee through the Sub-Divisional Office, that defendants had no occasion to claim adverse title against the Mela Committee or the Government or the plaintiff, that it is the case of the plaintiff that it was dispossessed from 'Kha' sched­ule land in January, 1973 and as such as per provision of Article 142 of the Limitation Act the plaintiff was required to file suit within 12 years from the date of dispossession and having had filed the suit in 1983, the same was filed quite within the period of limitation and as such the suit was not barred by limitation. The appellate Court finally held that plaintiff has title in the land in suit and that the plaintiff was dispossessed by the defen­dants from the land in Suit on January 22, 1973 and as the B.S.পর্চা prepared in the name of the defendants was without any basis, it can not be said that the defen­dants' claim in the land in Suit is genuine and legally sustainable, that the defen­dants in disprove of title of the plaintiff have not brought on record any material.<br/> <br/>8. The defendant/defendants of the respec­tive suit as against the judgment of the appellate Court moved the High Court in revisional jurisdiction and obtained Rules in the aforementioned civil revisions. It was the contention of the petitioners before the High Court Division that the judgment of the appellate Court was not a proper judgment of reversal since the find­ing of the trial Court, which was based on material evidence, was not reversed, that the finding of the appellate Court in the background of the Ext. C dated 15.11.1961 that although possession of the persons other then the Sitakunda Mela Committee was found but that would not disentitle the plaintiff to get the relief was erroneous and contrary to the materials on record, that finding of the appellate Court that the suit was not barred by limitation is also contrary to the materials on record, partic­ularly because of the Ext. C and that the suit of the plaintiff was barred by waiver, estopple and acquiescence since inspite of their averments made in the plaint that they were dispossessed from the land in suit in January 1973 but they waited for 10 years since the date of dispossession and thereby allowed the defendants to believe that they are the owners of the land in suit, that the appellate Court against the estab­lished principle of law that the plaintiff is to establish his case and can not have the relief on the weakness of the defense case allowed the appeal on the finding that defendants could not prove their claim as regard the land in suit on the basis of con­tinuous possession, that the trial Court dis­missed the suit on the finding that the land in suit is different from the land described in Ext.2, the deed of gift, on the basis of which plaintiff claimed the land but the appellate Court did not advert itself to the said finding, that the trial Court dismissed the suit on the finding that the land in suit is vague and indefinite and that the plain­tiff failed to prove from which part or por­tion of the land in suit it was dispossessed but the appellate Court while allowing the appeal did not reverse the said finding of the trial Court, that the appellate Court was in error in decreeing the suit without adverting to the finding of the trial Court that the land in suit was indefinite and identity of the land was not established by local inspection, that record of right hav­ing been in the name of the defendant and as the same has presumption of correct­ness under section 144A of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act the appellate Court was in error in discarding the Ext. D, (B.S.পর্চা) wherein name of the defendant appears, that though record of right and the rent receipts are not document of title but certainly those being the document of possession and in limited case can be used as a collateral evidence of title the appel­late Court was in error in setting aside the judgment and decree of the trial Court, that appellate Court having had not dis­cussed the evidence and in the absence of non-discussion of the evidence, correct decision in the background of the facts and circumstances of the case as could not be arrived at for ends of justice the case required to be sent back to the appellate Court for disposal on due consideration of the evidence on record, that appellate Court was in error in reversing the judg­ment of the trial Court inspite of the fact that the plaintiff's suit was bad for not describing the land in suit as requires by the provision of Order 7, Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/><br/>9. As against the aforesaid contentions of the defendant-petitioner(s) it was contend­ed on behalf of the plaintiff-opposite-party that the appellate Court on scrutiny of the evidence on record correctly arrived at the finding that the plaintiff proved its title and possession in the land in suit on the basis of Ext.2 i.e. deed of gift dated  January 15, 1963, that the appellate Court on consideration of the pleading and the evidence lead by the plaintiff in support thereof quite legally held that the suit was not barred by limitation as per provision of Article 142 of the Limitation Act, since plaintiff while in possession on the basis of the deed of gift from January 1963 was dispossessed on January 1973 and the suit was filed in 1983 and as such the suit was filed quite within time, that the appellate Court on due consideration of the materi­als on record as well as evidence, both oral and documentary set aside the finding of the trial Court relating to title and posses­sion of the plaintiff, that the appellate Court on proper scrutiny of Ext. C and the other materials as well as the evidence, both oral and documentary correctly held that defendant failed to prove their basis of possession and continuation of posses­sion thereafter as was noted in Ext. C. since the plaintiffs by reliable evidence proved their possession since January 1963 and dispossession in January, 1973 by the defendants, that the appellate Court having had noticed that in Ext. C names of the defendants do not appear and that inspite of the fact noted in the Ext. C the land was recorded in the name of the Sitakunda Mela Committee, the said Court has quite correctly recorded the finding that on the basis thereof (Ext. C) defendants are not claiming that their pos­session was recorded in Ext. C, rather it appears as the land was recorded in the name of Mela Committee, persons whose names appear in Ext. C gave up their claim in respect of the land in question, that the appellate Court was quite correct in dis­carding the case of the defendants of being in possession of the land since 1947 as because the persons, whose names appear in Ext. c claiming their possession from 1941, that the appellate Court because of the evidence lead from the side of the plaintiff was quite correct in arriving at the finding that the plaintiff established its claim of title in and possession of the land in suit and followed by dispossession therefrom, that only in Other Suit No. 157 of 1984 defendant examined 3 witnesses and in other two suits only prin­cipal defendants examined themselves, that the contention of the petitioner that the judgment of the appellate Court is not based on consideration of the materials on record is not correct since the appellate Court considered the evidence, both oral and documentary and thereupon made the decision as to the claim of the plaintiff in the land in suit, that though the defendants claimed possession since 1947 but in sup­port thereof no evidence was lead and defendants in support of their claim of possession in the land in suit relied on the B.S. record and the Ext. B-B(2)-rent receipts which stands in the name of the defendant of the Other Suit No. 158 of 1984, but the defendants of the other two suits did not file any parcha or rent receipt and that the rent receipt Exts. B-B(2) are of years of 1975, 1978 and 1983 and the appellate Court had noticed that the rent receipt of the year 1975 was erased or in other words was a tempered rent receipt, that the contention of the petitioners that there ought to have a local inspection for ascertaining identity of the land in suit is of no substance since the defendants did not challenge the identity of the land in suit, that defendants failed to make out a case of adverse possession, that the plain­tiff's suit was not bad for not describing the land in suit as per requirement of law, particularly as per provision of Order 7, Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, that no case from the side of the defendants was made out as to waiver, estopple and acquiescence on the part of the plaintiff and the contention of the defendants that plaintiff having had filed the suit after 10 years and allowed the defendants to believe that they have title in the land in suit is of no substance, that contention of the defendants to remand the suit to the appellate Court for disposal on discussion of the evidence is also of no merit since there is no finding in the judgment of the courts below that because of insufficiency of the evidence on record it was difficult for the said courts, particularly appellate Court to arrive at a decision as regard the case of the parties in the suit.<br/><br/>10. It may be mentioned that the trial Court dismissed the suit on the finding that description of the land given in the plaint does not tally with the land as in Ext.2, the deed of gift and that by Ext. 2 some other land other than the land in suit was gifted to the, plaintiff, that plaintiff did not mention from which portion of the land in suit defendants dispossessed the plaintiff, that the Exts.4 and 4(b) the ten­ancy agreements were created for the pur­pose of the suit and that Ext. C shows that the defendants are in possession at least for 40 years which is well beyond the peri­od of limitation and that the land of Mela Committee is under a separate khatian and the plaintiff was never in possession of the suit land and as such there is no question of dispossessing it from the land in suit and the suit was barred by limitation since it is the case of the plaintiffs that they were dispossessed in 1973 and the suit was filed after expire of 10 years and as such the suit was barred under Article 186 of the Limitation Act.<br/><br/>11. The High Court Division in the back­ground of the contention of the respective parties considered the evidence, both oral and documentary, led by the parties and other materials on record and thereupon arrived at the finding that the finding of the appellate Court as to induction of the plaintiff in the land in suit on the basis of Ext.2 and as to title in the background of the Exts.5, 5A and 6 read with Ext.1 (R.S. khatian) and Ext.2 (deed of gift) is quite sustainable, that the appellate Court on consideration of the Ext. A (C.S. khatian), Ext. C (order dated 25.11.1961 passed in the Miscellaneous Case No.95) as well as Ext. B series (rent receipts) and in the light of B.S.পর্চা filed by the defendants as well as the evidence adduced by the parties was quite correct in arriving at the finding that plaintiff acquired the land by gift from the Mela Committee, constructed huts thereon and let out the same to different tenants and the huts were burned by Pakistani army in 1971 and taking advantage of the land being vacant the defendants made forcible entry therein and thereupon erect­ed huts in the land in suit and thus dispos­sessed the plaintiffs, that the appellate Court upon considering the evidence, both oral and documentary of the parties, and particularly noticing absence of documen­tary evidence in support of the case of the defendants was quite correct in disbeliev­ing the defendants' story as to possession of the suit land on the basis of Ext. C. since defendants did not claim the land through the C.S. recorded tenants and in Ext. c name of defendants was not, that the appellate Court was not in error in not accepting the case of the defendants as of their being in possession since they failed to produce any evidence either oral and documentary to establish their possession since 1947 or thereafter, that the appellate Court was quite correct in holding that the Ext. C and the Ext. D (B.S. parcha) do not create any title in favour of the defendants since in Ext. C name of the defendants do not appear and that there was no basis for preparation of Ext. D in the name of the defendants of Title Suit No.158 of 1984 as because inspite of the materials in the Ext. C the land was recorded in the name of the Mela Committee both in R.S. and B.S. khatian and in the B.S. khatian pos­session of the Mela Committee was recorded, that there is no dispute that the Mela Committee gifted 30 decimals of land of R.S. plot No.792 listed in R.S. khatian No. 1700, that no evidence was lead from the side of the defendants that in the Miscellaneous Case No.95, wherein order was made on 25.4.1961 as evident by Ext. C, the defendants were parties along with the person whose name appeared in the Ext. C and that being the state of the matter the appellate Court was correct in holding that on the basis of Ext. C defendants can not raise any claim as to the land in suit in any respect or can not claim any possession in the land in suit since inspite of the Ext. C, in B.S. khatian land in suit and other land was recorded in the name of the Sitakunda Mela Committee and as to that fact no exception was taken from the side of the defendants, that the appellate Court on consideration of the documentary evidence as well as the oral evidence held that plaintiff got the land in suit described in schedule 'Ka' by the deed of gift and also got possession on the basis of deed of gift and thereupon erected huts and the same were burned in 1971 and the fact of burning of the huts in 1971 finds support indirectly from the evi­dence of the D.Ws. The appellate Court on consideration of the oral evidence as well as the documentary evidence held that the plaintiff has title in the land in suit and it was dispossessed from the land in suit on January 22, 1973 and the defendants upon dispossessing the plaintiff erected huts there, that by the B.S. পর্চা no title was cre­ated in favour of the defendant, that the appellate Court on independent considera­tion of the materials on record as well as the evidence lead by the parties correctly held that the plaintiff has established its right, title and interest in the land in suit as well as possession therein and also the fact of dispossession by the defendants from the land in suit, that it is not correct to say that the appellate Court without taking into consideration the evidence both oral and documentary reversed the finding of the trial Court, that although the defen­dants claimed that they are in possession of the land in suit for more than 30/40 years but except Ext. B series, which relates to the period subsequent to the date of dispossession of the plaintiff, the defen­dants did not file any paper to show that they paid rent before 1975 or that any record was prepared in their names prior to B.S. record, Ext. D, that the finding of the appellate Court that the suit is not barred by limitation is quite legally sound since the suit was filed within 12 years from the date of dispossession and the finding of the trial Court on the question of limitation is totally incorrect since the same was made against the provision of law as in Article 142 or 144 of the Limitation Act, that the appellate Court was quite correct in holding that the defendants failed to establish that they are possessing the land for the last 30/40 years and as against the said claim of the defen­dants, the plaintiff has proved that the defendants dispossessed it from the land in suit in 1973, that the trial Court while dismissing the suit left out of considera­tion the R.S. and S.A. khatians and the appellate Court considered the documen­tary evidence and upon considering the documentary and oral evidence made its judgment placing reliance quite correctly on the R.S. and S.A. khatian and was not in error in discarding the Ext. D since the same was prepared subsequent to the dis­possession of the plaintiff from the land in suit and there was no basis for the prepa­ration of the Ext. D in the name of the defendant of Title Suit No.158 of. 1984, that trial Court was in error in holding that the land in suit is unspecified, indefinite and vague since there was no such definite case from the side of the defendants and moreover the land in suit was described referring to the plot number and the khat­ian number as well as by referring to the boundary and in support of the claim in the land in suit plaintiff filed Ext.2, the deed of gift and the defendant did not challenge the genuineness thereof, nor disproved the correctness of the facts in Ext.2, that the defendants in their pleading did not plead any case of acquiring title in the land in suit by adverse possession, nor they established by leading reliable evi­dence their claim of acquiring title in the land in suit by adverse possession, that the trial Court dismissed the suit without dis­cussing the oral evidence and failed to consider the documentary evidence in its correct perspective and as against that the appellate Court duly considered the evidence, both oral and documentary and thereupon reversed the findings and deci­sions of the trial Court and set aside the judgment of the trial Court upon assigning cogent reason.<br/><br/>12. Leave was granted to consider the con­tentions that the land in suit belonged to C.S. recorded tenant Elahi Boksha and Mowla Boksha and it having not been established by the plaintiff how Sitakunda Mela committee got the land of C.S. khatian or in other words how Sitakunda Mela Committee acquired title of the C.S. recorded tenant as regard the land in ques­tion and obtained possession of the land in suit and thus plaintiff having had failed to prove title and possession in the land in suit the High Court Division was in error in arriving at a finding that the lower appellate Court has correctly found title and possession as regard the land in suit in favour of the plaintiff. It may be men­tioned defendants while opposing the claim of the plaintiff in the land in suit proceeded their case upon contending that the land in suit belonged to C.S. recorded tenants Elahi Boksha and Mowla Boksha and the land in suit or in other words land of the C.S. recorded tenants being full of jungle and also bushes, they abandoned the land and thereupon Revenue Department of the Government having had represented to the defendants that the land belonged to the Government they i.e. defendants went into possession of the land and upon clearing the jungle and bushes made the land in suit or in other words land of the C.S. recorded tenants usable and thereupon possessing the land for the last 30/40 years by paying rent to the Government. It may also be mentioned that defendants are not claiming the laud through Elahi Boksha and Mowla Boksha, nor has placed any material before the Court as to acquiring title through Elahi Boksha and Mowla Boksha. The defen­dant on the basis of Ext. C i.e. order passed in Miscellaneous Case No.95 in the year 1961 tried to make out a case that the land in suit was neither belonged to the plain­tiff, nor to the Sitakunda Mela Committee and as Ext. C shows that Mela Committee was not in possession but the land was possessed by the persons whose names find place in Ext. C, as such plaintiff did not acquire any title on the basis of Ext.2 in the land in suit. The lower appellate Court as well as the High Court Division considered the Ext. C and thereupon arrived at the finding that claim of the defendants as regard the land in suit on the basis of Ext. C is not sustainable since inspite of the fact whatever noted therein the land was recorded in the name of Sitakunda Mela Committee and the pos­session was also noted in favour of the Mela Committee. The High Court Division as well as the lower appellate Court also noticed that in Ext. C names of the defendants do not appear, nor the defendants brought any material on record to show that in Miscellaneous Case No.95 they were parties in the category of the petitioner and as the land was recorded inspite of the material in Ext. C in the name of the Sitakunda Mela Committee the High Court Division as well as the lower appellate Court was of the view, in our opinion quite correctly, that ultimately at whose instance Miscellaneous Case No.95 was initiated they abandoned their claim as against the land in suit since in R.S. khatian the land in suit was recorded in the name of the Sitakunda Mela Committee.<br/><br/>13. The learned Counsel for the appel­lant(s) in the respective appeals primarily submitted that the lower appellate Court was in serious error in setting aside the judgment of the trial Court while the said Court i.e. trial Court dismissed the suit on the finding amongst orders that the land described in the suit is indefinite, uncer­tain and vague. This submission has been made upon referring to the schedule 'Ka' of the plaint, particularly schedule 'Ka' of Title SuitNos.157 and 158 of 1984. It may be mentioned 3 Title Suits i.e. Title Suit Nos.157, 158 and 230 of 1984 were filed on the same date seeking declaration of title in respect of 30 decimals of land of plot No.792 listed in R.S. khatian No.1700 on the basis of Ext.2, the deed of gift in favour of the plaintiff by the Sitakunda Mela Committee on January 15, 1963. The land in respect whereof declaration of title so sought was described in schedule 'Ka' to the plaint. As stated hereinbefore that in the background of the description of the land given in schedule 'Ka' to the plaint of Title Suit Nos.157 and 158 of 1984 it was contended that the land in suit being vague, indefinite and uncertain or in other words having not been described in the light of the document Ext.2 on the basis of which plaintiff claiming the land in suit the same was liable to be dismissed and the trial Court was quite correct in dis­missing the suit on that ground. The schedule as given in the aforesaid two title suits is as follows:<br/>"-:(ক) তপশীল (বিরোধয়):<br/>জিলা-চট্টগ্রাম, মৌজা-মহাদেবপুর,থানা সীতাকুন্ড, আর,এস জরিপের ১৭০০ নং খতিয়ানের ৭৯২ নং দাগের আন্দর পশ্চিমাংশে .৩০ শতক।<br/>চৌহদ্দিঃ-<br/>উত্তরে-টেম্পল রোড<br/>দক্ষিনে-লাল ডিঘী<br/>পুর্বে-বাদী<br/>পশ্চিমে-আছনজ্জমা গং।"<br/><br/>14. It is pertinent to mention that in Title Suit No.230 of 1984 schedule 'Ka' is as follows:<br/>"-:তপশীল (বাদীর দান প্রাপ্ত জমি):-<br/>জিলা-চট্টগ্রাম,  মৌজা-মহাদেবপুর, থানা-সীতাকুন্ড,<br/>আর,এস জরিপের ১৭০০ নং খতিয়ানের ৭৯২ নং দাগের আন্দর পশ্চিমাংশে .৩০ শতক।<br/>চৌহদ্দিঃ-<br/>উত্তরে-টেম্পল রোড<br/>দক্ষিনে-লাল দিঘীর জলজলা, সীতাকুন্ড মাদ্রাসার জমি<br/>পুর্বে-উত্তরে পাড়স্থিত পাকাঘাট ও সীতাকুন্ড প্রাথমিক অবৈতনিক স্কুলের জায়গা<br/>পশ্চিমে-অক্ষয় কুমার দাশের দোতালা পাকা গৃহ।"<br/><br/>15.  The description of the land in suit given in schedule ‘Ka’ of Title Suit No.230 of 1984 is quite inconformity to the schedule given in Ext.2 i.e. the deed of gift dated January 15, 1963. It may also be mentioned that the southern and northern boundary of the land in suit as given in schedule 'Ka' to the plaint of Title Suit Nos.157 and 158 is the same as in Ext.2. As against the contention of vagueness of the land in suit of the appellants upon referring to the schedule of the plaint of Title Suit Nos.157 and 158 of 1984 it has been submitted by the learned Counsel for the plaintiff Respondent that as per provi­sion of Order 7, Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure the land in suit has been described upon referring to plot number, khatian number and also mentioning name of mouza wherein the land in suit situates and as in one of the suits which was tried along with the Title Suit Nos.157 and 158 of 1984 the schedule given being quite inconformity to the schedule given in Ext.2 on the basis whereof the plaintiff is claiming right, title and interest in the land in suit and the defendants having jointly contested the suit it can not be said that there was any difficulty on their part about the identity of the land in suit. The learned Counsel for the Respondent has also sub­mitted that when the land has been described upon referring to the settlement plot number and the khatian number and that northern and southern boundary of the land in suit given in the schedule 'Ka' to the plaint of Title Suit Nos.157 and 158 of 1984 being uniform to the schedule as given in Exii.2 and in the other suit i.e. in Title Suit No.230 of 1984 conforming to the description as in Ext.2 and the subject matter of all the suits being the one com­pact of land as in Ext.2 the contention of the defendants that the land being indefi­nite and unspecified the lower appellate Court and the High Court Division was in error in not dismissing the suit is not well founded as defendants did not feel any dif­ficulty in contesting the suit or in other words they contested the suit being quite aware of the identity of the land in suit since it was pleaded by the defendants that the land in suit i.e. land of plot No.792 of R.S. khatian No. 1700 belonged to Elahi Boksha and Mowla Boksha, the C.S. recorded tenants although they did not file any paper showing acquiring of title from the said persons nor they claimed interest in the land in suit through the said persons. In our view, as contended by the learned Counsel for the Respondent, that the mis­take as to eastern and western boundary as regard the land in suit was bonafide respect of the 2 suits i.e. Title Suit Nos.157 and 158 of 1984 since in the other suit i.e. Title Suit No.230 of 1984, which was filed on the very day as the other two suits were filed, the land in 'Ka' schedule was correctly described in the light of Ext.2. It has also been submitted on behalf of the appellants that the suit was bad for non-impleading the necessary parties, particularly Sitakunda Mela Committee, the recorded tenant in P.S. khatian, the mosque, which is in the land in suit and the Club and that no relief has been sought against the said parties who are admittedly on the land and as such the suit was not maintainable and the decree if any passed would be unexecutable. The plaintiff has established the fact that Sitakunda Mela Committee has gifted 30 decimals of land out of the land as listed in P.S. khatian and delivered possession to the plaintiff and that plaintiff possessed the same till dispossession by the defen­dants. The genuineness of the Ext.2 by which Sitakunda Mela Committee gifted the land to the plaintiff is not challenged or in other words genuineness of the Ext.2 has not been dislodged from the side of the defendants. This being the position the contention that plaintiff as did not implead Sitakunda Mela Committee as the party in the suit, the suit is bad for defect of party and that decree if any obtained in the suit in question the same would be unexe­cutable is of no merit since gift made by Sitakunda Mela Committee in favour of the plaintiff has been found by the High Court Division as well as by the appellate Court is genuine and that there is no mate­rial on record that subsequent to 1963 Sitakunda Mela Committee at any point of time claimed any interest in the land in suit. It is seen from the materials on record that there is a mosque in a part of the land in suit with the approval of the plaintiff and the club is in the land in suit as lisensee of the plaintiff. It was contended by the defendants that there is a public latrine in the land in suit but this fact has been denied by the plaintiff's witnesses and from the defendants' side the said fact was not established. In the afore state of the matter plaintiff's suit was not bad for not making the mosque and the club party in the suit. It has been contended on behalf of the appellants that no evidence was brought on record from the side of the plaintiff that on the basis of the deed of gift possession was handed over to it. In repelling the said contention plaintiff has examined P.W.1 who has stated that on the basis of the deed of gift possession was given to the plaintiff and the said witness has been corroborated by P.W.3. It has also been contended by appellants that there is no evidence that tole was estab­lished in the land in suit and the gift so made was acted upon. It is seen from the evidence of P.W.1 that tole was estab­lished in the land in suit-and he has been corroborated by P.W.2, P.W.3 and P.W.5. The above being the materials on record the contention as to that there is absence of evidence as to establishing tole and act­ing upon of the Ext.2 is of no merit. It has also been contended on behalf of the appellants that recovery of possession has been sought upon giving uniform bound­ary in respect of different quantity of land. The contention so made is of no merit since on perusal of the schedule 'Kha' of the plaint of the respective suits it is seen that except northern and southern bound­ary the two other boundaries are not same or similar. The southern and northern boundary of the land in suit is common in the schedule 'Kha' of all the suits since from the description of the land given in the schedule of Ext.2 it is seen the -land in suit is located on the south of temple road or in other words on the north of the land in suit is temple road and on the south ‘দিঘী’ or in other words on the north of the ‘দিঘী’ the land in suit is located and the front side of the land is the northern boundary which is on the south of the road i.e. the temple road. Since the boundary of the land in respect whereof khas possession has been sought for is not the same and similar as contended on behalf of the appellants and it being the definite case of the plaintiff that upon dispossessing it from the land, which is part of the land in 'Ka' schedule, in 1973 the defendants' erected huts as described in schedule 'Kha' and the defen­dants having not denied that they are not on the land as described in schedule 'Kha' to the plaint of the respective suits we are of the view the contention that the decree that has been passed by the appellate Court and affirmed by the High Court Division would not be executable is of no substance. It may be mentioned here that although it was the case of the defendants that they are on the land in suit for more than 30/40 but in support thereof did not produce any paper, rather it is found from the evidence of D.W.1 that he raised huts in the land in suit after 2/1 year of the lib­eration. It may be mention this D.W.I is the defendant No.1 in Other Suit No.230 of 1984. D.W.2 has stated that he has no paper to show that, his father possessed the land in suit from 1949 till 1973. It may be mention D W.1 has stated-that before 1973 huts on the suit land were burned. So from the evidence of this witness it is seen that the huts in the land in suit as stated by plaintiff were burned and it is the case of the plaintiff that huts were burned in 1971 by Pakistani army and that has been estab­lished by the plaintiff by the evidence of reliable witness.<br/><br/>16. The learned Counsel for the appellant upon referring to the discrepancy of the description of the land in suit as in 'Ka' schedule submitted that the land being not properly described or in other words being indefinite and for that trial Court having had dismissed the suit the High Court Division as well as the appellate Court were in error in arriving at the finding that the land in suit as contended by the defen­dants vague, indefinite and uncertain is not correct. It may be mentioned the suits, in all three, were filed on the same date and in the suits i.e. in Suit Nos. 157 and 158 of 1984 in 'Ka' schedule southern and northern boundary was given as per the deed of title, but the eastern and western boundary were not as in the deed of title. In the other suit i.e. in Title Suit No.230 of 1984 the boundary of the land in 'Ka' schedule was given as per the deed of title i.e. Ext.2. The High Court Division on consideration of the evidence and the other materials on record held that the plaintiff has described the land mention­ing the plot number and the khatian num­ber and also described the land by men­tioning the boundaries uniformly north and south, except in two suits stated east­ern and western boundary different from the Ext.2, but for that it can not be said that the land in suit is indefinite and unspecified and vague since defendants were very much aware that the land in suit is of plot'No.792 and they contested the claim of plaintiff as to the land in schedule 'ka' as the relief sought in the suit was as regard the land described in 'ka' and 'kha' schedules. It is seen from the evidence of D.W.4, who is defendant No.1 in Title Suit No. 158 of 1984, that the defendants being quite aware about the identity of the land in suit contested the suit and further defen­dants were aware which particular land was in suit or in other words as regard which particular land plaintiff was seeking relief evident from the cross examination directed by the defendants to the P.Ws. There is no dispute' that the land in suit was recorded in the name of Mela Committee in the R.S. khatian and the P.S. khatian was also prepared in the name of the Mela committee inspite of the obser­vation in Ext. C i.e. order passed in Miscellaneous Case No.95. It may be mentioned on Miscellaneous Case No.95 defendants of the instant cases were not parties and their names also do not find place in Ext. C. In the background of the said fact the appellate Court as well as the High Court Division held that there was no basis for the preparation of Ext. D i.e. B.S. khatian in the name of one of the defendants and the payment of rent by the Exts. B-B(2) can not be made basis, since B.S. khatian and the rent receipts relate to the period subsequent to the dispossession of the plaintiff from the land in suit, for holding that the defendants have title and possession in the land in suit. The learned Counsel for the appellants also has sub­mitted that fact being that in the suit land there is a mosque and club and also public latrine and the same having had not been impleaded relief as to declaration of title in the land in suit can not have and upon over looking those material facts the High Court Division as well as the appellate Court were in serious error in not holding that the suit is not maintainable. In repelling the aforesaid contention of the appellants the learned Advocate for the Respondent has referred to the evidence of P.W.1 who has stated that the mosque and the club are the plaintiff's lisencee and the said witness has also denied the existence of public latrine. P.W.1 has been corrobo­rated by P.W.3 and P.W.5. Because of afore mentioned evidence the contention of the appellants that without impleading the mosque and club the suit having been filed seeking the relief for declaration of title the same is not maintainable is of no merit. It may be mentioned it is more or less admitted fact or in other words undis­puted fact that the land in suit belonged to the Sitakunda Mela Committee and pos­session of the said Committee has been established by the evidence of P.W.1, P.W.3 and P.W.4 as well as by the docu­mentary evidence Ext.2 and the R.S. as well as P.S. khatians. The defendants although pleaded that the C.S. recorded tenant Elahi Boksha and Mowla Boksha were the owners of the land in suit, but the fact is that the defendants are not claiming the land through the C.S. recorded tenants. As mentioned hereinbefore their case was that the land in suit being covered by jun­gle and bush and they were being told by Revenue department that the land belong to the Government they cleared the jungle and bush and made the same usable and thereupon upon erecting huts they are pos­sessing the land in suit. As stated herein­before the land belonged to Sitakunda Mela Committee has been established by the oral as well as by the documentary evi­dence and on the basis of the evidence on record High Court Division as well as the appellate Court held that the land belonged to the Sitakunda Mela Committee and the plaintiff got the land from the Mela Committee. The appellate Court on consideration of the evidence and other materials on record held that plaintiff got the land from the R.S. record­ed tenant Sitakunda Mela Committee by the Ext.2, deed of gift and possessed the land through monthly tenants and that the temporary structures in the land in suit burned in 1971. It may be mentioned it was the case of the plaintiff that in 1971 the huts wherein plaintiff had monthly tenants were burned by the Pakistani army and that taking advantage of the land being vacant defendants entered on the land and erected huts. As against the said case of the plaintiff it was the case of the defendants that they are in possession of the land for 30/40 years. It may be men­tioned the appellate Court on scrutiny of one of the exhibits of B series i.e. rent receipt of 1975 found the same erased or in other words tampered and the other two rent receipts relates to the period subse­quent to the year of dispossession as claimed by the plaintiff. The undisputed position is that R.S. and P.S. records stand in the name of the Sitakunda Mela Committee and in that background the appellate Court as well as the High Court Division held that there was no basis for the preparation of the Ext. D in the name of one of the defendants. It is in the evidence of D.W.2 that he erected huts after '2/1' year of the liberation war of Bangladesh. D.W.2 has stated that he has no paper to show that his father and after him he is on the land from 1947 to 1973. On consider­ation of the evidence produced from the side of the plaintiff and the evidence lead from the side of the defendants the appel­late Court as well as High Court Division arrived at the finding that the land in suit was possessed by the plaintiff and the defendants dispossessed the plaintiff therefrom. It was submitted by the learned Counsel for the appellants that evidence is absent from the side of the plaintiff to show that on the basis of Ext.2, the deed of gift, the plaintiff got the possession of the land in suit or that anybody handed over possession to the plaintiff and that evi­dence also is lacking about establishment of tole in the land in suit. The submission so made is not correct. As from the evi­dence of P.W. 1 it is seen that in the light of the Ext.2 the possession was handed over to the plaintiff. P.W. 1 has been corroborat­ed by P.W.3. As regard the establishment of to be P.W.1 has stated about the estab­lishment of tole and in support thereof submitted the resolution book (Ext.8) and he has been supported by P.W.2, member of the to be committee and also by the P.W.3 who has deposed about the fact of tole committee. As it has been stated here­inbefore that it was the contention from appellants' side the land suit was in uncer­tain, unspecified and vague, but the evi­dence from the side of the defendants is otherwise, as the D.W.1 has stated that the land in suit is on the south of the temple road, that Jagabondhu's shop is west of the land in suit and D.W.4 has stated that the land in suit is of plot No.792. From the appellant's side a feeble argument was made as to acquisition of title by the defendants by adverse possession. There was no pleading of the defendants as to acquisition or claim of title in the land in suit by adverse possession. The appellate Court considered the aforesaid contention of the defendants and in the background of the materials on record held that papers i.e. Ext.C. Ext.D and the Exts. B-B(2) series have not given rise to any claim of adverse possession by the defendants since the admitted position is that R.S. and P.S. record of rights stand in the name of Mela Committee and the Ext.D and B series are the papers subsequent to the dis­possession of the plaintiff from the land in suit by the defendants and inspite of the fact stated in Ext. C the land was recorded in the name of the Mela Committee and that in Ext. C name of the defendants do not appear and that in Miscellaneous Case No.95 wherein order was made on 25.11.1961 (Ext.C) the defendants were not parties. On the top of everything no evidence was lead from the side of defen­dants to establish the case of acquisition of title in the land in suit by adverse posses­sion. It has also been submitted from the side of the appellants that in case decree is passed in the suits that would violate the provision of Rule 9 of Order 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The submission so made is of no merit since description of the land in suit as given in the schedule is quite sufficient to identify the same both by referring to the boundary as well as by referring to the survey plot number.<br/><br/>17. In the background of the materials on record and the discussions made herein-above we are of the view the High Court Division was not in error in affirming the judgment and decree of the lower appel­late Court since the same was based on due consideration of the evidence, both oral and documentary. On examination of the judgment of the High Court Division we do not find any infirmity of the kind calling for interference.<br/>Accordingly the appeals are dismissed with costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
