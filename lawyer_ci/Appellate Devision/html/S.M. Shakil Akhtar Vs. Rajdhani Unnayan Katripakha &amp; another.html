Ruhul Amin J. - </strong>These two peti­tions for leave to appeal are directed against the common judgment and order dated 11.07.2006 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Writ Petition Nos. 5972 of 2003 and 575 of 2004 discharging both the Rules with some directions and observations.<br/><br/>2. The case of the writ petitioner in Writ Petition No. 2301 of 1992, in short, is that the High Court Division passed an order of injunction on 28.06.1992 and the order was extended from time to time and was ultimately extended till disposal of the Rule restraining the writ respondents from leasing out the writ petitioner's plot of land to anybody. After hearing of the Writ Petition the Rule issued was made absolute and direction was given to the writ respon­dents to hand over possession of Plot No.9, Block No. CEN(A), Gulshan Model Town, Dhaka, (measuring 16 kathas and 7 chattaks) to the writ peti­tioner within two months from the date of receipt of the order of the Court but despite receipt of the certified copy of the judgment on 04.04.1999, the writ respondent contemner has in disobedi­ence of the Court's judgment and order failed to hand over the said plot to the writ petitioner.<br/><br/>3. The further case of the writ petitioner is that she was allotted a plot as men­tioned above by DIT now Rajuk on 06.04.1962. The DIT granted 99 years lease in favour of the writ petitioner, which was executed and registered in 1967.<br/><br/>4. The writ petitioner received a Memo from Rajuk on 11.12.1991 asking her to show cause as to why the said lease of the demised land should not be deter­mined on the ground that she did not make any construction according to the approved plan within the time stipulated in the lease deed.<br/><br/>5. The writ petitioner's contention is that she constructed one storied building within the date as approved by Rajuk and started residing therein. Thereafter, she received another letter on 18.03.1992 informing that the lease had been determined and the Rajuk also ille­gally demolished the boundary walls and building in the petitioner's plot. Rajuk made advertisement for applica­tions for lease of the writ petitioner's plot on 17.04.1992 and she filed Writ Petition No. 2301 of 1992 in June, 1992 impugning the actions of Rajuk and the Rule was issued on 28.06.1992 and <em>interim</em> order was passed restraining the Rajuk from leasing out the plot in ques­tion to anybody for a period of 4(four) months and subsequently the same was extended till disposal of the Rule and ultimately the Rule was made absolute by judgment and order dated 22.11.1998 directing the Rajuk to hand over the pos­session of the demised premises to the writ petitioner within two months from the date of receipt of the order. But inspite of communication of the order of injunction to the Rajuk, they illegally leased out the plot in question in favour of 3(three) different persons and renum­bered the petitioner's demised plot from plot No. 9 to Plot No. 5 and sub-division in Plot Nos.5, 5A and 5B respectively and Plot No.5 was allotted to Mrs. Shamsur Nahar Khan by Rajuk, Plot No. 5A was allotted to Mr. S.M. Shakil Akhter by Rajuk and Plot No. 5B was allotted to Mr. Shawkat Shamim by Rajuk and granted them 99 years lease and lease deeds were executed on differ­ent dates. Therefore, the Rajuk and oth­ers committed gross contempt of the Court for violation of the judgment and order of the Court and in not implement­ing the judgment of the Supreme Court. The contemner respondents have ten­dered apology. The judgment of the High Court Division was challenged in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 384 of 2000. Thereafter another Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 154 of 2000 was filed by subsequent lessees and a review petition was also filed for reviewing the judgment dated 6th July 2000 by the Appellate Division. The review petition was also dismissed. When the respondents decided to cancel the lease in favour of subsequent lessees for implementing the judgment and order of the High Court Division, 3 (three) writ petitions by subsequent lessees were filed, namely, Writ Petition Nos. 4311 of 2004, 575 of 2004 and 5972 of 2003. In all the writ petitions the writ petitioners obtained <em>interim</em> order. In Writ Petition No. 5972 of 2003 the writ petitioner obtained injunction order restraining the respondent No.1 from cancelling the lease of the Writ Petitioner in Plot No. 5A, Road No. 96 of Gulshan Model Town and dispossess­ing him from the said plot or to make any hindrance to the enjoyment by the writ-petitioner of the property.<br/><br/>6. In three writ petitions the case of the writ petitioners is that they are bonafide lessees under Rajuk by registered lease deed and they were inducted into pos­session and made construction spending huge amount of money and, therefore, cancellation of the lease is without any lawful authority. Their further case is that they were not made parties in the Writ Petition No. 2301 of 1992 and the contempt petition and they had no knowledge of the pendency of the writ petition and the judgment passed in the writ petition.<br/><br/>7. The High Court Division after hear­ing held that none of the subsequent allottees have acquired any legal title in the plot which was earlier allotted in favour of the writ petitioner of Writ Petition No. 2301 of 1992. The judg­ment of the High Court Division as well as the Appellate Division must be implemented and any impediment creat­ed in implementing the judgment or obstruction thereto or disobedience of the judgment is a clear contempt. The High Court Division also held that the respondents in the contempt petition are already in contempt and accordingly the Rule issued in the writ petitions filed by the subsequent allottees, namely, Writ Petition Nos. 4311 of 2004, 575 of 2004 and 5972 of 2003 were discharged and the Rajuk was directed to hand over vacant possession of the Plot No. 9, Block No. CEN(A) Gulshan Model Town, Dhaka in favour of the writ peti­tioner of Writ Petition No. 2301 of 1992 without any further excuse and to make arrangement for allotment of alternative plots in favour of the writ petitioners of Writ Petition Nos. 4311 of 2004, 575 of 2004 and 5972 of 2003.<br/><br/>8. We have heard Dr. M. Zahir and Mr. Ozair Farooq, the learned Counsel for the petitioner in C. P. No. 1070 of 2006 and Mr. Mahbubey Alam, the learned Counsel for the petitioner in C.P. No. 1206 of 2006 and Mr. Ajmalul Hossain, the learned Counsel for respondent No.2 in both the cases and perused the judg­ment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/><br/>9. It is not disputed that, Plot No. 9, Block No. CEN(A), Gulshan Model Town, Dhaka was allotted to the writ petitioner of Writ Petition No. 2301 of 1992 and leased out for 99 years by a registered lease deed by Rajuk and she constructed  one storied  building  and was residing therein. Rajuk subsequent­ly cancelled the allotment and demol­ished the building and the plot was renumbered as Plot No.5 and sub-divid­ed into Plot Nos. 5, 5A and 5B and allot­ted to the writ petitioners of Writ Petition Nos. 4311 of 2004, 575 of 2004 and 5972 of 2003.<br/><br/>10. In the background of the above facts, Writ Petition No. 2301 of 1992 was filed and Rule was made absolute as noticed earlier with some directions to the Rajuk. The Rajuk did not take any posi­tive step for restoration of the lease granted earlier in favour of the writ peti­tioner of Writ Petition No. 2301 of 1992.<br/><br/>11. The subsequent allottees filed three Writ Petition Nos. 4311 of 2004, 575 of 2004 and 5972 of 2003 on the grounds stated in the writ petition as discussed above. The High Court Division on con­sideration of the materials on record held that inspite of the fact that the sub­sequent allottees lost both in the High Court Division and in the Appellate Division, the Rajuk did not take any step for restoration of the lease granted earli­er in favour of writ petitioner of W.P. No. 2301 of 1992. So, she filed a con­tempt petition against Rajuk and others. In respect the writ petitioners of Writ Petition Nos. 4311 of 2004, 575 of 2004 and 5972 of 2003 filed by the subse­quent allottees, the finding of the High Court Division is that they did not acquire any valid title by taking lease of Plot No. 9 subsequently renumbered as Plot Nos.5, 5A and 5B of Block No. CEN(A), Gulshan Model Town, Dhaka.<br/><br/>12. In our view since plot No. 9, Block No. CEN(A), Gulshan Model Town, Dhaka was earlier allotted in favour of writ petitioner of writ petition No. 2301 of 1992 and the lease deed for 99 years was executed and registered on 15.11.1967 and possession was deliv­ered to her and she constructed pucca building and was residing therein. Subsequent cancellation of the same and demolition of her building and granting of lease of the same plot by sub-dividing into Plot Nos. 5, 5A and 5B are patently illegal and an act of high handedness on the part of Rajuk.<br/><br/>13. Therefore, in our view, the High Court Division took into consideration all aspects of the matter and came to a correct decision. There is no cogent rea­son to interfere with the same. The direction to the Rajuk given by the High Court Division as regard the writ peti­tioners in Writ Petition Nos. 5972 of 2003, 575 and 4311 of 2004 in our view is quite sufficient in respect of the griev­ance of the said writ petitioners.<br/>Both the leave petitions are dis­missed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
