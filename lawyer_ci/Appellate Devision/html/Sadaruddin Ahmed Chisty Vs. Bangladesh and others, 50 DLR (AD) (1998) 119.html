Two books written by another person were also similarly forfeited by the Government by a separate Notification of the same date. The forfeitures were made under section 99A(1)(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In respect of the forfeiture of eight books the petitioner filed Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 464 of 1994 under section 99B of the Code of Criminal Procedure and in respect of forfeiture of the other two books the author thereof filed Criminal Revision No. 668 of 1994. Both the cases were heard by a Special Bench of the High Court Division composed of three Judges, as required under section 99C of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Special Bench discharged the Rule in Criminal Revision No.668 of 1994. The petitioner’s petition for leave is confined to the six books in respect of which the order of forfeiture dated 8-12-93 and the Notification dated 30-12-93 have been sustained by the Special Bench. <br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> Mr. Md Abdur Rashid, learned Advocate for the petitioner, submits that the grounds of forfeiture stated in the Notification are not covered by section 99A(1) (a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He points out that the reasons given for forfeiture are:  <br/>ÒBmjvg ag©vej¤^x‡`i agx©q Abyf~wZ Z_v †gŠwjK wek¦v‡mi cwicš’x AvcwËKi e³e¨ cÖKvwkZ nIqvqÓ [<em>because of objectionable matters published which are subversive to the basic religious belief of Islamic believers</em>]  and these reasons are not enough to attract the mischief of section 295A of the Penal Code. He relies upon the decision in the case of <em>the Working Muslim Mission &amp; Literary Trust, Lahore vs. The Crown, 8 DLR (FC) 110</em>. <br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> We have perused the Notification at page 146 of the paper book. Section 99A requires the Government to state the grounds of its opinion by Notification in the official gazette. It does not require the Government to repeat <em>ad verbatim</em> the ingredients of section 295A. Section 99D of the Code of Criminal Procedure requires that the Special Bench shall, if it is not satisfied that the forfeited books contained any such matter as is referred to in sub-section (1) of section 99A, set aside the order of forfeiture. In other words the Special Bench has the responsibility of being negatively satisfied that the forfeited books do not contain any such matter as is referred to in the said sub-section.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> The Special Bench appears to have gone through all the books and found that at least two books do not contain any matter as is referred to in sub-section (1) of section 99A, but in respect of the other six books the Special Bench was not so satisfied. As such, we do not think that the contention of the learned Advocate that the grounds of forfeiture stated in the Notification are not covered by section 99A of the Code of Criminal Procedure has any more relevance once the Special Bench has applied its  mind in terms of section 99D of the Code of Criminal Procedure. <br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> Mr. Md Abdur Rashid next contends that in the impugned Notification no satisfaction of the Government is indicated. <br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> Under section 99A no satisfaction of the Government is to be indicated. To forfeit a publication it is enough if it “appears to the Government” that a certain publication contains any matter as is referred to in sub-section (1) of section 99A. The Government is only required to state by Notification in the Official Gazette the grounds of its opinion, not its satisfaction or formation of opinion. <br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> Mr. Md Abdur Rashid next submits that in exercising its jurisdiction under section 99D of the Code of Criminal Procedure the Special Bench was required to be satisfied as to whether the grounds of forfeiture stated in the Notification are covered by section 99A of the Code of Criminal Procedure or not, but instead of doing so it made a roving inquiry as to whether the grounds of forfeiture existed or not.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong> We have already noticed that under section 99D of the Code of Criminal Procedure the Special Bench is to be negatively satisfied that the forfeited publication does not contain any matter referred to in sub-section (1) of section 99A. In doing so the Special Bench took great pains in going through all the books and found that except for two books there is nothing to show that the rest do not contain any such matter. On the contrary, the Special Bench found there are several matters in the six books which contained matters referred to in sub-section (1) of section 99A. <br/> <br/>We therefore do not find any ground for interference. <br/> <br/>The petition is dismissed. <br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></span></div></div></div>
