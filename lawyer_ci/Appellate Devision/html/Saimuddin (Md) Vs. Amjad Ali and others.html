The respondent Nos.1 to 216 as plain­tiffs instituted Other Class Suit No.418 of 1978 (renumbered as Other Class Suit No. 60 of 1993) for declaration of title and recovery of khas possession in the suit property stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit properties were granted permanent lease in 1327 BS at annual rent of Taka 66/4/0 by <em>ex-landlords</em> Sree Provash Chandra Basak and others in favour of Nayebuddin Sarker and others and that Nayebuddin Sarker and others executed kabuliyat to the effect on 1-12-1920 and that Majaruddin, one of the lessees, sold share in the suit property by registered deed of sale dated 15-11-1943 to the defendant Nos. 38-40 and that Jafuruddin sold share on 30-10-1959 to one Kasaruddin Mondal and some other lessees also transferred lands from their share to various purchasers and the plaintiffs purchased the suit properties and are in possession of the same.<br/><br/>3. It was further averred that the rent rolls were prepared in the names of the plain­tiffs but subsequently, it was wrongly prepared in the names of the heirs of the ex-landlords, the defendant Nos.3-10, but the plaintiffs paid rents and the records of right so prepared are wrong and without any foundation.<br/><br/>4. It was further stated that on 15-6-1976 while the plaintiffs offered rent to the tahshilder then it was detected that the names of the plaintiffs had been cancelled from the SA record and it stood recorded in the names of the defendant Nos. 3 to 10.The plaintiffs stated further that the defendant Nos. 15/34/21 cons­tructed houses in the suit property. The plain­tiffs therefore, felt constrained to institute the suit.<br/><br/>5. The defendants Nos.1, 2, 11-41 contest­ed the suit by filing written statement. It was asserted that the defendant Nos. 11-14 took lease of the suit properties from the govern­ment and are in possession of the suit property.<br/><br/>6. During pendency of the  suit  the defendants filed an application for revaluation of the suit property on the averment that the suit land is more than 106 bighas but the suit has been valued at Taka 70,760 whereas the valuation of the suit property would be more than Taka 10,00,000 (ten lac) and that the juris­diction of the Court of Joint District Judge, where the suit was pending, was also questioned praying for transferring the suit to the Court of the learned Assistant Judge of competent jurisdiction. The learned Joint District Judge before whom the suit was pending by order dated 25-8-2003 rejected the application.<br/><br/>7. The defendant-petitioners moved the High Court Division under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure in Civil Revision No.5411 of 2003 and a learned Single Judge of the High Court Division by the impugned judgment and order discharged the Rule.<br/><br/>8. Hence is this petition.<br/><br/>9. In support of the petition Mr. Mostafa Niaz Mohammad, learned Counsel, submits inter alia, that the High Court Division commit­ted error in the decision in discharging the Rule thereby affirming the order of the Joint District Judge who rejected the application of the petitioners raising objection as to the valuation of the suit property. Moreso, accord­ing to the learned Advocate, the learned Joint District Judge passed the said order without holding any enquiry under section 8(C) of the Court-Fees Act.<br/><br/>10. Mr. Enayatur Rahim, learned Advo­cate, opposed the petition.<br/><br/>11. We have considered the submissions and perused the materials on record.<br/><br/>12. In view of the persistent contention of the learned Advocate as to the necessity of revaluation of the suit property, we are of the view that the trial Court shall be at liberty to consider the matter of valuation of the suit property at the time of trial of the suit and shall pass necessary orders as deemed fit according to law as to payment of Court fees, if any, by the plaintiff.<br/>With the above observation, this petition is disposed of.<br/>Ed</div></div></div>
