The predecessor of the plaintiff-petitioners instituted Title Suit No. 46 of 1985 in the Court of the learned Assistant Judge, Lohagora, Narail and the suit was decreed <em>ex parte</em> on 26.02.1995. The respondent  Nos.1 and 2 being the defendants in the suit filed an application under Order 9 Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure for setting aside the <em>ex-parte</em> decree on the basis of which Miscellaneous Case No. 24 of 1995 was started and that during pendency of the aforesaid Miscellaneous Case the plaintiff filed a solenama purported to have been executed between the parties and prayed for dismissal of the Miscellaneous Case for non-prosecution and the learned Assistant Judge accordingly dismissed the Miscellaneous Case on 02.01.2002 for non-prosecution.<br/><br/>3. The respondent Nos.1 and 2 filed an application on 02.02.2002 before the learned Assistant Judge under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure stating that they did not execute any solenama and that solenama filed before the Court was forged one and as such the Miscellaneous Case filed by them should be restored. The learned Assistant Judge after hearing the parties allowed the application setting aside the previous order dated 02.01.2002 and restored the Miscellaneous Case.<br/><br/>4. The plaintiff petitioners being aggrieved moved the High Court Division under Section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure against the aforesaid order of the learned Assistant Judge.<br/><br/>5. A learned Single Judge of the High Court Division after hearing the parties discharged the rule and directed the learned Assistant Judge to refer the matter to the Court of the learned Magistrate for prosecuting the plaintiff petitioners in accordance with law for committing the offence of forgery in the solenama and also awarded cost as already mentioned above.<br/>Hence the petition.<br/><br/>6. Mr. Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of, the petitioners submits, <em>inter-alia</em>, that the High Court Division committed error in law in not considering that the solenama has been formally proved by the respondent No.2 A. Razzaque Lasker and as such the impugned judgment discharging the rule and    directing prosecution is not sustainable.<br/><br/>7. He further submits that the respondent No. 2 A. Razzaque Lasker being himself examined as witness in support of the solenama, the order of awarding cost of Tk. 10,000/- (ten thousand) against the petitioners cannot be maintained.<br/>We have considered the submissions and perused the materials on record.<br/><br/>8. It appears that the respondents filed the application under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure alleging forgery in the solenama filed before the Court praying for dismissal of their Miscellaneous Case and that the learned Assistant fudge compared the signatures in the solenama with other admitted signatures and opined that the signatures appearing in the solenama did not tally with the admitted signature and as such came to the finding as to commission of forgery in the solenama and for committing the offence of forgery in the solenama filed before the Court referred the matter to the learned Magistrate for trial according to law.<br/><br/>9. In consideration of the facts and circumstances we do not find any illegality in the judgment of the learned Assistant Judge.<br/><br/>10. We have also perused the judgment of the High Court Division and we are of the opinion that the High Court Division considering the facts and circumstances came to a correct decision in discharging the rule and did not commit any illegality in directing to prosecute the plaintiff-petitioners in accordance with law.<br/><br/>11. We have, however, considered the submission of the learned Counsel as to the order of the High Court Division in awarding cost of Tk. 10,000/- (ten thousand) upon the plaintiff-petitioners and we are of the view that in the facts and circumstances of the case ends of justice would be met if the plaintiff-petitioners are exempted from payment of the aforesaid cost of Tk. 10,000/- (ten thousand). The plaintiff-petitioners are accordingly exempted from payment of the said cost.<br/>With the above observation this petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
