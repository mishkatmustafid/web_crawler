The predecessor of the petitioner Nos.1-19 as well as the predecessors of the respondent Nos. 8-21, as plaintiffs, filed above Title Suit No.13 of 1980 seeking partition of 'Ka' scheduled land and also seeking declaration that the deeds as described in the schedule 'Kha' and Ga to the plaint are illegal, collusive, null and void, fraudulent and not binding upon them on the averments that Jagabandhu Shil was the owner of the suit land and after his death his three sons Krishna Kanta, Protap Chandra and Nishi Kanto owned the suit land in equal shares and the record of right in R.S. Khatian No.1135, shich included Plot Nos. 6550 and 6551, was also pre­pared in their names; Krishan Kanta trans­ferred his 30 decimals of land in favour of the plaintiff No.1 by a registered patta dated 9.6.1953 and also delivered posses­sion and the plaintiff No.1 is possessing the said land by paying rents; Protap Chandra having died issueless laving behind his widow, Sundari Bala Shil, who along with Krishna Kanta and Nisha Kanta, the reversioners, became the onwer of the portion of Protab Chandra; the record of right in S.A. Khatian No. 970 in respect of 30 decimals of a land in favour of the plaintiff No.1 by a registered patta dated 9.6.1953 and also delivered posses­sion and the plaintiff No.1 is possessing the said land by paying rents; Protap Chandra having died issueless leaving behind his widow, Sundari Bala Shil, who along with Krishan Kanta and Nisha Kanta, the reversions, became the owner of the portion of Protab Chandra; the record of right is S.A. Khatian No. 970 in respect of 30 decimals of land was pre­pared in the name of the plaintiff No.1 who out of that sold 15 decimals of land in favour of the plaintiff Nos. 2-5 by kabala dated 13.8.1979 and also delivered pos­session to them and thus the plaintiff Nos.1-5 are possessing the suit land measuring 30 decimals; the balance 60 decimals of and appertaining to Plot Nos. 6550 and 6551 being wrongly recorded in S.A. Khatian No.1446 in the name of Nishi Kanta and Sundari Bala, who left for India, was declared as vested property and was leased out to the defendant No.1 and thus the defendant Nos.1 and 2 who have no right, title, and interest in the land measuring 30 decimals of land which the plaintiff No.1 got by patta dated 9.6.1953; the defendant Nos.1 and 2, on 5.1.1980, claimed the suit land on the basis of two fictitious kabalas dated 27.7.1960 and 18.4.1979 purported the have been execut­ed by plaintiff No.1 and the defendant No. 3 and hence the suit. The defendant Nos. 1 and 2 contested the suit by filing written statement contending that Krishan Kanta has transferred his share to the plaintiff No.1 through a patta dated 9.6.1953 but thereafter the plaintiff No.1 by Kabala dated 27.7.1960 retransferred the same to Krishna Kanta but however in the said kabala dated 27.7.1960, the plain­tiff No.1 instead of relevant khatian No.970 and Plot Nos. 6550 and 6551 with an area of .30 acres of land, collusively inserted Khatian No. 937 and Plot Nos. 1399 and 1407 containing an area of .44 acres of land and that after the death of Krishna Kanta, his son, the defendant No.3, having sold out the entire land to the defendant Nos.1 and 2 by kabala dated 18.4.1979 and the defendants Nos.1 and 2 possessing the suit land and the plaintiffs have got no right, title, and possession over the suit land.<br/><br/>3. The trial Court, after hearing, decreed the suit. On appeal and the learned Additional   district Judge, 1st Court, Barisal, after hearing, allowed the appeal and thereby dismissed the suit. The plain­tiffs then moved the High Court Division and obtained Rule and after hearing the High Court Division discharged the Rule.<br/><br/>4. We have heard the learned counsel for petitioner and perused the impugned judg­ment and order and other connected papers.<br/><br/>5. As it appears the High Court Division took the view that, in view of the princi­ples laid down in the case of <strong><em>Md. Nurullah Chowdhury vs. Golam Sollaiman Kazi 26 DLR (HC) 70</em></strong> and in the case of <strong><em>Rahela Khatun and another vs. Fayezuddin Shah 38 DLR (AD) 6,</em></strong> the appellate Court, instead of sending the suit on remand, was competent to admit evidence to decide whether the plaintiff No.1 executed the kabala dated 27.7.1960 in favour of Krishna Kanta and whether both the LTI in the said kabalas are of the same person and accordingly in appellate Court did not commit any error in examining the hand writing expert and admitting additional evidence and then arriving at the finding that it is the plaintiff No.1 who executed the deed of sale dated 27.7.1960 in favour of Krishan Kanta and further the appellate Court also observed that in the instant suit for partition and declaration in respect of deeds as mentioned in schedule Kha and Ga of the plaint the trial court should have framed issues in respect of the share of the plaintiffs in the suit land and also should have decided as to whether the plaintiff No.1 executed the trial Court, on miscon­ceived view, decreed the suit even though the plaintiff No.1 failed to prove his title and possession in the suit land.<br/><br/>6. We are of the view that the High Court Division on proper consideration of the materials on record discharged the Rule. The learned counsel could not point out any illegality or infirmity in the decision of the High Court Division so as to call for any interference.<br/><br/>7. The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
