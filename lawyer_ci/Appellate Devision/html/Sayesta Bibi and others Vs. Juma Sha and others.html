H. Rahman J.-</strong>This appeal, at the in­stance of the heirs of defendant No. 1, is directed against the judgment of the High Court Division, Sylhet Bench passed in Second Appeal No. 1509 of 1968.<br/><br/>2. The plaintiff-respondents instituted Title suit No. 22 of 1962 in the Court of Munsif, First Court, Sadar, Sylhet for partition of the undivided family homestead in the suit and also prayed for purchasing the share of defendant No. 1, a stranger-purchaser of a portion of the suit homestead from some co-sharers of the plaintiffs. Their case, in brief, is that the two brothers Hadu Shah and Nadu Shah took lease of southern half of the disputed homestead from the landlords. Subsequently Nadu Shah atone took lease of the northern half. Hadu Shah got 1/4th and Nadu Shah got 1/4th share of the homestead. Hadu Shah died leaving two daughters Feroja and Hafiza and brother Nadu Shah. The plain­tiffs, being the heirs of Nadu Shah, claimed 5/6th share of the suit property. There was no previous partition. As the plaintiffs' demand for an amicable partition was not conceded they filed the present suit for partition. Further case of the plaintiffs is that they were entitled to purchase the share of defendant No. 1, a stranger purchaser, under section 4 of the Partition Act and read with section 44 of the Trans­fer of Property Act.<br/><br/>3. Defendant No. 1, alone contested the suit, His case was that Bedu Shah was the original owner of the suit land. He died leaving two sons, Hadu and Nadu, and a daughter, Modina. Hadu Shah died leav­ing one son, Sadu Shah, two daughters Firoza and Hafiza, and a widow, Kutibibi. Kuti Bibi died leav­ing Firoza and Hafiza who sold their interest to Ambor and others. Modina died leaving one son Amjad, who leaving two sons Ambor and Amfor. Amfor and minor children of Ambor sold half of the home­stead to defendant No. 1 by a kabala dated 15.2.87 and since then he was in continuous possession in the specific portion of the land he purchased. It was further contended that the plaintiffs' claim was exces­sive and section 4 of the Partition Act was not ap­plicable in this case.<br/><br/>4. The suit was once decreed on contest but on appeal the matter was remanded to the trial Court. Thereafter the suit was again decreed by the trial Court. The trial Court found that defendant No. 1 was a stranger and he only acquired 4/5 share by his purchase. The plaintiffs were given 7/15th share of the suit homestead on partition and were allowed to purchase Defendant No. 1's share.<br/><br/>5. On appeal the learned Subordinate Judge af­firmed the decree of the trial Court as to defendant No. 1's share. He observed: "The present suit land is no doubt homestead land but is not a dwelling house of an undivided family". He allowed the appeal in part by holding that defendant No. 1 was not a stranger and he was already in possession of a specif­ic portion of the homestead and therefore he should also get a separate saham.<br/><br/>6. In second appeal the High Court Division restored the decree of the trial Court after affirming the finding of the trial Court that the plaintiffs and the co-sharers-defendants had their dwelling house in their suit property and they were entitled to purchase 4/15th share of defendant No. 1 by purchase from the co-sharer-defendants of the plaintiffs.<br/><br/>7. On behalf of appellants it contended that the High Court Division erred in law in not considering that the vendors of defendant No. 1 had been in pos­session of a specific portion of the homestead and that defendant No. 1 had also been residing there for a tong time since his purchase on 15.2.1957 and that he was no longer a stranger in the suit property. It is also urged that the plaintiffs can easily get a separate saham for their 7/15th share in the home­stead land by maintaining the existing possession of co-sharers as far as possible causing least disturbance to other co-sharers in possession.<br/> <br/>8. On the other hand, the respondents submit that the tower appellate Court's finding that defen­dant No. 1 was no longer a stranger is based on a misconception of both fact and law because the suit property was never previously partitioned by metes and bounds.<br/><br/>9. The High Court Division upheld the plain­tiffs' contention and restored the decree of the trial Court after considering <em><strong>Md. Tazammul Hossain Vs. Purni Agarwalini 10 D. L. R. 318 and Md. Magdu Bhuiya Vs. Jabban Huq 11 DLR 355 and Md. Habibullah Patwari Vs. Pran Ballav Bhakta &amp; others 9 DLR 119 </strong></em>and some cases of Indian jurisdiction. In this case we need not reconsider those decisions.<br/><br/>10. After considering the mores of our people, the co-sharers' attachment to their ancestral house and their anxiety to preserve the purdah and privacy of the members and inmates of the undivided dwell­ing house, the legislators made the provisions of section 4 of the Partition Act. The expression 'a dwelling house belonging to an undivided family' is to be liberally construed. We have done so in <em><strong>Sree Jugal Kishori Sarker Vs. Azizur Rahman &amp; ors 40 DLR (AD) 150.</strong></em> A co-sharer's prayer to buy up a stranger-purchaser may not be refused on a technical ground.<br/><br/>11. The appellate Court's finding that "the suit land is no doubt a homestead, but is not a dwelling house of an undivided family" is utterly miscon­ceived. In the suit land an undivided dwelling house is situated. The defendant himself claimed to be re­siding in a portion there. The suit property never lost its character of an undivided homestead because there had admittedly been no partition by metes and bounds by any previous arrangement. The impartible character of the suit property remained undisturbed when the suit was filed in 1962. There is no time limit for filing an application under section 4 of the Partition Act. In the instant case the plaintiffs' claim cannot be called stale. The defendant's claim of continuous possession since purchase would be of no consequence. The claims of the parties in a case are to be determined with reference to their respective positions existing at the time of the filing of the suit. Hence we do not find any substance in the ap­pellant's second contention that the plaintiffs could get a separate saham by maintaining the existing possession of the co-sharers. If an application under section 4 of the Partition Act is filed to buy-out a stranger-purchaser after an inordinate delay from the date of the purchase then the applicant himself may suffer. When an applicant's prayer is allowed under section 4 of the Partition Act it involves a kind of forced sale for the stranger-purchaser. And hence the Court would in equity determine the valuation of the transferred share on the date of the filing of the ap­plication for permission to purchase the share of the stranger-purchaser.<br/><br/>12. In view of the above, the appeal is dis­missed. No costs in this appeal.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
