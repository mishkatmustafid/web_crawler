Short facts are that the writ-petitioner-respondents was the owner of the house known as "Hriday Nibash" within Mymensingh Municipality and the said house was requisitioned by the Collector of Mymensingh in H.R. Case No. 58/59-60 for the use of office of the Plant Protection Officer under the Agriculture Department. Subsequently, the house was occupied by the Regional Director of Agriculture Department for the last 5/6 years. In the meantime, process of acquisition of the property in question was started in L.A. Case No. 33 of 1965-66 and the same is still pending for acquisition. The property though not acquired by the Government, the Agriculture Department issued a tender on 15.5.1989 for renovation of the building in question at a cost of Tk. 3,55,000/-. The writ petitioner being aggrieved by the tender notice as owner of the property challenged the tender notice before the High Court Division in the writ petition.<br/><br/>3. The writ respondent-petitioners by filing an affidavit-in-opposition stated that the notification of the final acquisition of the said suit property in the official gazette has been delayed because of the successive representations made by the writ petitioner to the Ministry of Land Reforms and Land Administration and also for several civil suits between the Government and the owner of the house in question.<br/><br/>4. It is further contended in the affidavit-in-opposition that the suit building is an old building of more than 100 years back and the house being in dilapidated condition, it being absolutely unsafe and risky for use of office accommodation, the renovation of the building was urgently felt and as such tender was called for.<br/><br/>5. Leave was granted to consider the submissions that the property in question having been requisitioned for the purpose of acquisition under the Emergency Requisition of Property Act in 1965-66, the High Court Division was wrong in making the Rule absolute on the basis of submission made relying on the provision of section 23 of the Acquisition and Requisition of Property Ordinance, 1982 and the further submission that in the absence of any averment made in the writ petition to the effect that the Deputy Commissioner did not obtain any report from the local executive engineer regarding the condition of the requisitioned building, the High Court Division was wrong in not applying the provision of section 7C of the Emergency Requisition of Property Act relying on the submission that such report was not obtained by the Deputy Commissioner and also the submission that in any view of the matter, Gazette Notification having been made on 18.3.1993 under section 5(7) of the Emergency Requisition of Property Act, 1948, whereby the title to the property in question in the Government, the Rule cannot made absolute.    <br/><br/>6. We have heard Mrs. Nasima Haider, the learned Deputy Attorney General for the appellants and Mr. Muhammad Nawab Ali, the learned Advocate-on-Record for the respondent No.2 and perused the impugned judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record.<br/><br/>7. The learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the appellants has drawn our attention to the Gazette Notification dated 18th March, 1993 of the Ministry of Land in respect of the suit premises (at page 110 of the paper book) and submitted that final Gazette Notification under section 5(7) of the Emergency Requisition of Property Act, 1948 in respect of the suit premises has already been made on 18th March, 1993 and as such the right, title and interest if any of the previous owner had extinguished and the property absolutely vested in the Government.<br/><br/>8. In the facts and circumstances of the case and in view of the fact that final Gazette Notification under section 5(7) of the Emergency Requisition of Property Act, 1948 had already been made in 1993. In our view the judgment of the High Court Division requires interference by us.<br/>Accordingly, the appeal is allowed without any order as to costs.  <br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
