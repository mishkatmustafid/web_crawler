The petitioners as plaintiffs instituted Title Suit No.7 of 1998 impleading the respondent No.1 as principal defendant and respondent Nos.2-4 as pro forma defendants praying for decree for permanent injunction in respect of the suit land alleging, inter alia, that they are owners in possession of C.S. Plot No.167 which has been correctly recorded in the names of the plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs are in exclusive possession of the said plot. It is further stated that the land measuring 633 square feet has been leased out by the plaintiff No.1 in favour of the plaintiff Nos.2-10 as per Rules of the Zilla Parishad and the plaintiffs Nos.2-10 are in exclusive possession by carrying on business upon constructing tin shed shops on the suit land but the defendants were threatening the plaintiffs with dispossession and hence the suit.<br/><br/>3. The defendant No.1 as the respondent No.1 has been contesting the suit by filing a written statement denying the allegations and contending amongst others that the suit land is vague and uncertain.<br/><br/>4. Mr. Muhammad Samsul Hoque, learned Advocate, appearing for the petitioner submits that the prayer for local investigation is seemingly innocent as observed in the impugned order but most dangerous as in effect it is designed to grab the Government land as it is founded on a claim, made by the defendants-respondents in   the written statement and written objection and referred to in their application for local investigation filed in Title Suit No. 7 of 1998, which is barred by the Emergency  Requisition  of Property  Act, 1948 and also barred by <em>Res judicata</em> as the claim was settled against the predecessor of the respondents in Title Suit No.45 of 1996 and Title Appeal No. 131 of 1997 and further the claim is subjudice in view of pendency of Title Appeal No.173 of 2003 and Demarcation Case No. 59 of 2003 elaborately stated in paragraph No.4 of the instant civil petition for leave to appeal to show how the respondents have made to grab the Government land; that the respondents have practiced fraud in their evil design to grab the Government land requisition vide Dacca Gazette dated 15.10.1953 and 21.07.1955 in the background stated in paragraph No.4 of the present civil petition for leave to appeal which could not be made clear before the High Court Division as the learned Advocate for the petitioners having missed the cause list was not present at the time of disposal of the Civil Revision No.5047 of 1998 while he was instructed by the petitioners to file a supplementary affidavit to furnish necessary particulars and thus material points having not been considered by the High Court Division there has occasioned failure of justice; that the defendant-respondents in the written statement filed in Title Suit No.7 of 1998 and written objection against the plaintiffs' petition for injunction claimed that Haji Abdul Jalil Khan got possession of the land appertaining to C.S. Plot No. 166 on 28.05.1953 while the requisition of the said land by the Government was published in the Dacca Gazette on 15.10.1953 and 21.07.19.55 the claim of the defendant-respondents is legally barred by the Emergency Requisition of Property Act,1948 and had this material fact been not suppressed by the defendant-respondents the trial Court would not have entertained the application for local investigation at the instance of the persons having no <em>locus standi</em> in the matter.<br/><br/>5. The learned Advocate further submits that in the Title Suit No.45 of 1996 filed by the father of the defendant-respondent No.1 the trial Court categorically observed that he has no title to the land appertaining to C.S. Plot No. 166 which is the Government requisitioned land and the fraudulent decree obtained by him in Title Suit No.4 of 1996 was set aside and Title Suit No.45 of 1996 filed by him was dismissed on contest wherefrom appeal being Title Appeal No.131 of 1997 was also dismissed and he did not further proceed and as such, the same claim by his successors in any separate proceeding is simply barred by Res-judicata and the prayer for local investigation solely based on such a claim which is not maintainable was liable to be thrown out <em>in limini</em>; that in the present suit for simple permanent injunction filed by the plaintiff-petitioners while their possession over the suit land has been admitted and also proven by documents.<br/><br/>6. The learned further submits that as per admitted documents the defendant-respondents have no title, no possession over any portion of the suit land i.e. C.S. Plot No.167 or 166. So, they have no <em>locus standi</em> to file an application for local investigation and further no useful purpose would be served by local investigation as in the circumstances in a suit for simple permanent injunction; no remedy is available to the defendants while as per admitted documents, the plaintiffs are in possession and locally influential defendants having threatened the plaintiffs with forcible dispossession; the order for local investigation at the instance of the defendants may create some scope for them in these days of unrest and uncontrolled law and order situation to fish in the troubled water and even blood shed is not unlikely; that the claim of the respondents to the effect that no portion of the suit land was ever been requisitioned by the Government on the face of the Dacca Gazette published on 15.10.1953 and 21.07.1955 showing requisition by the Government whether at all maintainable is required to be settled once for all to stop multiplicity of proceedings being handed by the different bodies of the Government at the cost of public money and also causing unnecessary harassment to the petitioners.<br/>Lastly, the learned Advocate submits that only the respondent No.1 contested the suit claiming that his father executed two <em>Heba-bil-Ewaz</em> transferring (12+11)=23 decimals of land in his favour but the day when those two deeds were executed, Haji Abdul Jalil Khan had no right to the suit land in view of the judgment and decree passed in Title Suit No.45 of 1996 and Title Appeal No.131 of 1999 and therefore nothing was passed to the respondent No. 1 by those deeds and he fraudulently suppressed these material facts.<br/><br/>7. It appears that the plaintiff filed the suit praying for a decree for permanent injunction in respect of the suit land asserting his exclusive possession in the suit land but the defendant contested the suit filing written statement stating the suit land as vague and uncertain. Under the circumstances the plaintiff filed a prayer for local inspection of the suit land for ascertaining the question of structure standing thereon. The defendant as well filed an application under order 26 of rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure for holding local investigation of the suit land in order to ascertain the suit plot and its boundary through an Advocate Commissioner. By order dated 15.10.1998 the learned Assistant Judge allowed both the prayers but the plaintiff being aggrieved by the order allowing local investigation on application of the defendant moved the High Court Division and the High Court Division discharged the Rule holding, <em>inter alia</em>, that the defendant raised the prayer of identity of the   suit land and sought for a local investigation to ascertain the same in order to resolve the issue involved in the suit.<br/>In view of the above, we do not find any substance in the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioners.<br/>Accordingly, this application is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
