The impugned decision was thus made without the petitioner being heard. In support of his allegation, the petitioner has enclosed a copy of the notice, which clearly states that the FMA No. 42 of 1997 has been set down for hearing on 25 June, 1997.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong> Mr. Korban Ali, learned Advocate, entering caveat for respondent No. 1, had no reply to the allegation made by the petitioner. Mr. Korban Ali says that he was not in the High Court Division and so it is difficult for him to refute the allegation. <br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> There is no reason to disbelieve, prima facie, the allegation made by the petitioner. Nobody should suffer for any wrong done or omission made by a Court. It is a fit case in which the petitioner should move the High Court Division for a rehearing of the appeal and the Court should allow it provided the allegation is found to be correct.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> Mr. Mahbubey Alam, learned Advocate for the petitioner, has submitted that on merit, also the impugned judgment is not sustainable, the submission may be reserved for the appropriate forum. Here the petitioner succeeds on the ground that he could not make his submission in the appeal for no fault of his own.<br/> <br/>The petition is disposed of with observation as above.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
