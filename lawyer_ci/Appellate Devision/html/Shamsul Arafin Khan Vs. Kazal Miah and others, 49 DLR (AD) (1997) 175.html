The appellant who was a contesting candidate challenged the election by filing an election petition on 13-4-92 contending, <em>inter alia,</em> that the adjourned election held on 26-2-92 for Ward No. 1 at Amtali Primary School Centre has been vitiated by practicing fraud in the said election by the said elected Chairman. The appellant prayed for setting aside the election of that polling station and for holding fresh election. Respondent No. 1 contested the case by filing written objection and denied all the material allegations.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> The Election Tribunal allowed the election petition on contest and set aside the election held on 26-2-92 of Amtali Primary School Centre of Ward No. 1 and directed for holding re-election at that centre. Respondent No. 1 on 28-7-93 preferred Election Tribunal Appeal No. 5 of 1993 in the Election Appellate Tribunal and did not pursue the same after several adjournments and finally the same was dismissed for default on 30-6-96. In Revision, a learned Single Judge of the High Court Division made the Rule absolute and restored the appeal to its file and number subject to payment of Taka 5,000.00 to the appellant within 30 days by respondent No. 1 in default the order of the High Court Division shall stand vacated and the appeal will be deemed to have been dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> Leave was granted to consider whether the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division acted legally in recalling his earlier order of rejection of the revisional application as not being pressed without assigning any reason and granted full relief to respondent No. 1 without issuing any Rules upon the appellant affording any opportunity to appear In the case o a failure of justice.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> In the election tribunal case the appellant who was the election petitioner got the relief wherein the election held on 20-2-92 in Ward No. 1 of Amtali Primary School Centre was declared as a whole void and the tribunal ordered for holding a fresh election in that centre. Thereafter respondent No. 1 filed Election Tribunal Appeal No. 5 of 1993. In spite of several adjournments he did not appear on the date of hearing of the appeal and the appeal was dismissed for default. In revision while exercising the revisional jurisdiction the learned Single Judge by his order dated 18-8-96 rejected the application as not been pressed after observing as follows:<br/> </span></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size:14px">“The learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that he has instruction not to pass this application. Hence this application is rejected as being not pressed.”</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px"> <br/><strong>7.</strong> Later on the unsigned order was recalled. There is in fact nothing on record to show whether the unsigned order was recalled <em>suo motu</em> or on the prayer of the learned Advocate for respondent No.1. No reason was assigned to recall the unsigned order of the learned Judge. Thereafter on 20-8-96 the revision was disposed of and the election tribunal appeal was restored to its file and number after setting aside the order of dismissal for default of the appeal subject to payment of Taka 5,000.00 by the appellant to respondent No. 1. In disposing of this revisional application it appears that neither any Rule nor any notice was served upon the appellant for appearing in the case when the matter was taken up for hearing.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> This practice of granting relief summarily without issuing any Rule is held to be illegal and unfair by this Division in the case of <strong><em>Abdul Wahab vs. Ali Ahmed</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>44 DLR (AD) 55</em></strong>. In that view of the matter, the exercise of jurisdiction by the High Court Division in revision appears to have been done illegally without giving any fair hearing to the appellant.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the impugned order set aside without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></span></div></div></div>
