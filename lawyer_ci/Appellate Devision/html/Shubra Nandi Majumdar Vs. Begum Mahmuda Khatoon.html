Facts as follows: —One Sarat Kumar Kanungoo made a Will on 19th March, 1986 and a few days later he died on 11.4.86. Whereby he bequeathed all his moveable and immoveable properties to the appellant who was made executrix of the said Will. She filed the Probate case for granting of probate. The Respondent filed an application in the said case for adding her as a party in that case on the allega­tion that the testator had entered into an agreement with her to sell schedule-1 property and made over possession to her. She further stated that she had al­ready filed Other Suit No.34 of 1986 in the 1st Court of Subordinate Judge, Chittagong for specific perfor­mance of contract. The appellant opposes the said prayer by filing a written objection, denying all alle­gations and stating that the testator was not in pos­session of all his property and the appellant is in possession therein. The respondent did not acquire any interest or possession.<br/><br/>3. The learned District Delegate allowed the prayer of the respondent for adding her as a party. Be­ing aggrieved by the said order the appellant filed Civil Revision Case No.85 of 1987 in the High Court Division and the learned Judges after hearing the parties discharged the rule.<br/><br/>4. Leave was granted to consider whether the High Court Division was correct in interpreting sec­tion 283 of the Succession Act.<br/><br/>5. Facts are not disputed. The only question is whether the respondent could be added as a party in the proceeding under section 283(1)(c) of the Succes­sion Act. Section 283(1)(c) of the Succession Act runs as follows: —<br/>"In all cases the District Judge or District Delegate may, if he thinks proper...(C) issue citations calling upon all persons claiming to have any interest in the estate of the deceased to come and see the proceedings before the grant of probate or letters of Administration."<br/><br/>6. Mrs. Begum Mahmuda Khatoon, respondent claimed interest in the estate of the testator on the basis of an alleged agreement for sale between herself and the testator. As has been noticed she has already filed a suit for specific performance of a contract.<br/><br/>7. Number of decisions have been cited by the High Court Division in coming to the conclusion—<br/>"We are of the opinion that opposite party Mrs. Begum Mahmuda Khatoon having claimed interest on the basis of an alleged agreement for sale with the testator must be deemed to be per­son claiming interest in the estate of the testator and as such entitled to oppose the probate pro­ceeding."<br/><br/>8. The learned Judges repelled the contention of the appellant that the claim of the respondent is inde­pendent of the Will and found that the ruling in <em><strong>33 DLR (AD) 254</strong></em> has no manner of application.<br/><br/>9. Mr. S.R. Pal, appearing for the appellant, contended that the respondent cannot claim "to have any interest in the estate of the deceased" Mr. Pal argued that the High Court Division had erred in law in not considering that while Transfer of Property Act deals with transaction <em>inter vivos,</em> the Succes­sion Act deals with the estate of the deceased. The Respondent may have concluded a contract with the testator during his life time but section 283 deals with the estate of the deceased for the purpose of granting probate or letters of Administration. Mr. Pal contended that the respondent could not be added as a party in the proceeding and the learned Judges have misappreciated the decisions cited before them.<br/><br/>10. Sarat Kumar Kanungoo entered into con­tract with the respondent on 4.4.70 for selling of cer­tain immoveable properties. Respondent claimed that in part-performance of the said contract, the testator had delivered possession of that property in her fa­vour and she was in possession therein. Sarat Kumar Kanungoo died on 11.4.86 and the application for granting probate was filed on 15.5.86. The suit for specific performance of contract was filed in June, 1986. Now the respondent wants to be added as a party.<br/><br/>11. The moot question depends upon the inter­pretation of the expression "claims to have any inter­est in the estate of the deceased". High Court Divi­sion relied on the case of <em><strong>Brindaban Chandra Shaha Vs. Sureswar Shaha Pramanick </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> C.L.J. Vol. 1909 page 263</strong></em>. Mokherjee and Vincent, JJ. took the view that although a reversionary heir had very remote interest in the estate of the deceased he was nevertheless entitled to oppose an application for probate. <em><strong>Nabin Chandra Guha Vs. Nibaran Chan­dra Biswas 36 C.W.N. page 635</strong></em> was considered where on the basis of auction purchase an application was filed claiming interest in the estate of the testator. The District Judge held that he had no <em>locus standi</em> to oppose the application for granting probate but the Calcutta High Court reversed the District Judge's view and came to the conclusion that since he was an auction purchaser of the interest of one of the heirs of the testator he was entitled to oppose the application for grant of a testimentary paper. This judgment was given by Mokherjee and Guha, JJ. and one of them was party to the decision in the Brindaban Chandra Shaha's case and it was found that a purchaser from an heir after the death of the testator has a <em>locus standi.</em> Next <em><strong>Haripada Shaha and another Vs. Ghanasyam Saha and another 49 C.W.N. page 713</strong></em> was considered wherein the Calcutta High Court Division took the view that Haripada and his brother were entitled to oppose the grant of the probate as any interest, however, slight, and even the bare pos­sibility of an interest was sufficient to entitle a per­son to enter a caveat in a probate proceeding.<br/><br/>12. It may be noticed that in this case one Ramapada was alleged to have left a Will and his wife Subasini was appointed sole executrix. Rama­pada died leaving widow Subasini and Haripada and another who were his father's younger brother's sons. The widow Subasini applied for grant of probate but died during the pendency of the probate proceeding. It was alleged that she also had left a Will by which Ganasyam Saha and another have been appointed ex­ecutors and under which her two brothers were lega­tees. When Ganasyam and the other executor applied for grant of probate of the said Will Haripada and his brother lodged a caveat. The District Judge held that Haripada and his brother had no locus standi to op­pose the grant of probate of the subsequent Will on the ground that if the properties attracted in the sub­sequent Will were the properties of Subasini, her brothers would be, according to Dayabhaga Law, her heirs in preference to Haripada and his brother. This view of the District Judge was reversed by the High Court holding that Haripada and his brother were en­titled to oppose the grant of the probate. Then the case of <em><strong>Mutukdhari Singh Vs. Smt. Prem Debi and others AIR 1959 Patna 570</strong></em> was considered and it was found that an interest, however slight or the bare possibility of an interest or even an interest dependent upon remote contingencies, is sufficient to entitle a person to oppose a Will and such a person had interest within the meaning of section 283(1)(C) of the Act. Lastly, the decision in <em><strong>G. Jaykumar Vs. R. Ramaratnam AIR 1972 Madras 212</strong></em> was consid­ered. In that case one Amarawathi Ammal bequeathed her properties by a Will in favour of Jaykumar who was also alleged to have been appointed the sole exe­cutor of the Will. When Jaykumar filed an applica­tion for grant of probate Ramaratnam entered a ca­veat alleging that he was the foster son of the testatrix and that the testatrix and her husband had taken him to their house from an Orphanage and had created a trust in his favour in respect of the estate of the testatrix. It was held that Ramaratnam was enti­tled to intervene.<br/><br/>13. The High Court Division on consideration of the above rulings have come to the conclusion as under: —<br/>"Having thus explained the scope of section 283(1)(C) of the Succession Act, let us now proceed to examine whether the opposite party in the present case can claim to have any inter­est in the estate of the testator, Sarat Kumar Kanungoo. In the present case, the Opposite Party acknowledges the title of the testator on the estate left by him and attracted in the Will and her claim is a possibility of acquiring an interest therein dependent upon certain contingency that is, establishment of an alleged contract entered into with the testator and enforcement of the said contract. She has not claimed any interest in the estate of the deceased dependent of the tes­tator and though a third party. Nor has she set up title adverse or paramount to the title of the testator. Her claim is not also independent of the Will as she claims through the executant of the will. At least, she has a possibility of acquiring interest in the estate of the deceased in the event of her proving the alleged contract and enforce­ment thereof. As such, she must be deemed to be the person claiming to have interest in the estate of Sarat Kumar Kanungoo, the testator, within the meaning of section 283(1)(C) of the Succession Act. She is, therefore, entitled to op­pose the application for probate."<br/><br/>14. The High Court Division noticed the ob­servation of this Court in <em><strong>Charubala Sen v. Abdul Hashem and others, 33 DLR (AD) 254. </strong></em>It is as fol­lows: —<br/>"Succession Act means an interest through the testator. A person who claims outside or independently of the will or claims adversely to the testator and disputes his right to deal with the property cannot be deemed to claim any in­terest in the estate of the deceased."<br/><br/>15. The High Court Division concluded that this observation does not bring the mischief of the ruling because she claimed interest "through the tes­tator".<br/><br/>16. It is unfortunate that the learned Judges of the High Court Division had misappreciated the rul­ings cited before them. The simple question has been complicated by citing unnecessary citation of deci­sions which have no manner of application in the facts and circumstances of the present case.<br/><br/>17. The basic fact is that Sarat Kumar Kanungoo entered into the contract with the respondent in 1970. He died in 1986 and during all these years she did not bring a suit for specific performance of con­tract. An attempt was made to show that she was de­livered possession of the part of the property in ques­tion which, however, does not inspire confidence because of certain litigations over the possession by way of claiming injunction, etc. the suit for specific performance of contract was filed only when the pro­bate proceeding was filed. A simple proposition has been made complicated. The question is whether she is entitled to citation within the meaning of section 283 of the Act. The plain and simple answer is in the negative. So what is the compelling necessity for adding her as a party in a succession proceeding when the question is whether she is entitled to cita­tion if at all. She is entitled to bring the suit for re­dress of her grievance for breach of contract and she has already filed the suit for specific performance of contract. If she succeeds then the suit will be decreed and it could be executed against the executor of the Will. Therefore, she is not deprived of any remedy. Mr. T.H. Khan argued that she could object to the granting of the probate but how will that step assist her in claiming relief in the suit for specific performance of contract is not understood.<br/><br/>18. Mr. T. H. Khan attempted to argue relying on section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act. The argument is fallacious because if she is claiming title then she is doing so adversely to the testator whereas the citation can be issued to a person "claiming to have any interest in the estate".<br/><br/>19. Mr. Pal rightly contended that the Transfer of Property Act has no manner of application in a case under the Succession Act. Moreover, it seems that Mr. Khan's clients filed an injunction petition against the appellant but that petition was not grant­ed. That shows that the story of possession is not so much convincing as Mr. Khan wanted us to believe. However, that will not detain us in coming to the conclusion on the real question as to whether the re­spondent should be added as a party in this proceed­ing. Applying test that was given in the Madras case, we have no hesitation in saying that the re­spondent does not answer the description who should be present in such proceeding. See <em><strong>M.K.</strong></em> <em><strong>Sowbhagiammal and another Vs. Komalangi Ammal and an­other </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> AIR 1928 Madras 803.</strong></em> The Court after reviewing a number of decisions observed: —<br/>"In dealing with the question; has the Caveator the necessary interest? —The test is, does the grant displace any right to which the Caveator would otherwise be entitled? If so, he has such an interest; if not, he has not."<br/><br/>20. With respect, this test appeals to me be­cause as the learned Judge has noticed that in every case it must be shown that the Caveator, but for the Will, would be entitled to a right of which that will deprive him. In the present case the Will does not disentitle the respondent to which she is otherwise entitled. Her case is that of specific performance of contract. If she succeeds the suit will be decreed.<br/><br/>21. Section 211 of the Succession Act is the complete answer because it says that the executor or administrator, as the case may be, of a deceased per­son is his legal representative for all purposes and all the properties of the deceased person vested in him as such. So the respondent is not without any remedy for the execution of the decree. Section 53A creates no real rights. It is estoppel between the proposed transferee and transferor which shall have no opera­tion against 3rd person (See<em><strong> 46 CWN 374 P.C.</strong></em>).<br/><br/>22. In <em><strong>33 DLR (AD) page 254</strong></em> it has been clearly laid down by this Court that a person who claims outside or independently of the Will or claims adversely to the testator and disputes his right to deal with the property cannot be deemed to claim any in­terest in the estate of the deceased. It was ob­served: —<br/>"The crucial point in this case is whether the respondents claim any interest in the estate through the testator, and since they do not and cannot do so, they got no locus standi to be add­ed as a party to the probate proceeding."<br/><br/>23. Thus, the point has been settled and there is no scope for taking different view.<br/>24. In the result, the appeal is allowed and the judgment and order of the High Court Division is set aside. No cost.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
