The vendor of the plaintiffs had been possessing their land through Bharatia; there is a two-storey building covering plot No. 94 and halt of plot No. 940 and the kitchen and latrine stands in the suit plot No. 16. It is stated in the plaint that Sen Brothers were the Bharatias; the defendant No.1 at one time forcibly occupied the first floor of the liking whereupon the Sen Brothers started criminal case against him and in consc­ience he vacated the building. Again defendant 1 forcibly occupied the suit plot No. 942 id eventually vacated the same plot as well but dispossessed the plaintiffs' vendor from the suit plot in Agrahayan, 1367 B. S. and hence the suit.<br/>The defendant contested the suit by filing written statement and he mainly based his claim on adverse possession since 1357 B.S. and contended that the suit is barred by limitation as well.<br/><br/>2. The trial court decreed the suit. It was noticed that Ext.D is a Bhara agreement and it mentions sub-letting of the premises only for one year. Further Ext. A and A (1) show that defendant also paid rent to the owners for the months of Bhadra and Jaistha, 1357 B.S. The learned Munsif concluded that the defendant came on the suit premises in 1357 B.S. on the strength of Bhara kahuliat and not by forcible occupation as claimed. Then it was noticed Ext. 7 the decree that was, passed in T.S. No. 466 of 1958 against the defendant No.1 at the instance of sons of Afsar Kazi and Ext. 1 which shows that the plaintiffs in that suit got khas possession on 29.7.61 against the defendant No. 1 of this suit. In this view of the matter it was concluded by the trial court that the forcible possession by the defendant had taken place after 1961 and not before 1366 B.S. as claimed by the defendants. The trial Court, therefore, concluded that the suit is not barred by limitation. Then it considered the kabala Ext. 2 and con­sidered the oral evidence and came to the con­clusion that the plaintiffs have purchased the land along with other lands that are mention­ed in the kabala. Accordingly the trial court decreed the suit for khas possession and also for mesne profit arising out of the suit land during the period of their dispossession and directed eviction of defendant 1.<br/>On appeal the appellate court below, how­ever, reversed the judgment and order of the trial court and allowed the appeal and dismis­sed the suit. The appellate court below after noticing Ext. A and A(1) concluded that the Bhara agreement Ext. D was not renewed and therefore after the expiry of the lease mention­ed in Ext.D’ the defendants were in posses­sion adversely since 1357 B.S. If the dispos­session rook places in 1357 B.S. then the appellate court below considered that the suit was barred by limitation. The appellate Court below, however, ignored Ext. 1 and Ext. 7 namely, decree and writ of possession in Title Suit No. 466 of 1958 against the defendants. Be it noted that the khas possession was given on 29.7.61. This over-sight has led the appe­llate court to come to an erroneous conclusion that the defendants "openly and adversely was in physical possession of the suit property somehow or other" and inferentially recorded the finding the adverse possession had perfected into title. In this view of the matter the appeal was allowed and the judgment and decree of the trial court was set aside and the plaintiff's suit was dismissed.<br/><br/>3. The High Court Division dismissed the appeal preferred by the plaintiffs by holding:<br/>''Both the courts below have found that the plaintiff's vendors were dispossessed in the year 1357 B.S. correspon­ding to 1950-51 and the suit was filed in July long after the expiry of the 12 years. The suit was evidently time barred and the courts bellow has rightly dismissed the suit".<br/>To say the least, the observation of the learned Single Judge is contrary to record. It is unfortunate that the learned Single Judge again erroneously recorded:<br/>“The suit was dismissed unto first apneal on the ground that it was barred by limitation."<br/><br/>4. The trial court decreed the suit by holding that the kabla in question shows that the plaintiff purchased all the lands that are mentioned in the kabala. So it is concluded that the plaintiff have got right, title and interest in the suit land. On point of limita­tion the Trial Court concluded as under:<br/>''So I can conclude now that the forci­ble possession as alleged by the plaintiff took place in the years 1367 B.S. and not in the year 1357 B.S as alleged by the defendant 1 and as such the suit is well in time and not barred by limitation''.<br/><br/>5. On the face of such observation by the trial court it is beyond comprehension as to how the learned Single Judge could come to the conclusion that ''both the courts have found that the plaintiff's vendor were dispossessed in the year 1357 B.S." This was palpably wrong and contrary to record. The learned Single Judge then referred to a decision in <strong><em>19 DLR 912 </em></strong>for the proposition that that until the plaintiff oroves his possession within 12 years, there is no onus on the defendant to prove his adverse possession. That decision was given on article 142 of the Limitation Act but in the present case the trial court recorded the findings that the plaintiff was dispossessed in 1367 B.S. and not 1357 B.S as the defendant claimed. That finding of fact was reversed by the appellate court by holding that dispossession took place in 1357 B.S without noticing however, the fact of the S.T.No. 466 of 1958 (Ext. 7) and that decree was passed against the defendants on 23.6.60 and the plaintiffs in that suit got khas possession on 29.7.61 vide Ext. 1. The appellate court re­versed the finding of fact on evidence but once it is shown that such reversal has been made without taking notice of the documentary evidence the second appellate court may reassess the evidence and come to its own finding on this point Unfortunately, the learned Single Judge had proceeded on the basis that the plaintiff was dispossessed in 1357 B.S. was the concurrent finding of fact which, however, is not the case. This misrea­ding of the judgment of the courts below has led the High Court Division to an erroneous conclusion which requires reversal of its decision.<br/><br/>6. Lastly, the contention of the defendant that he is in adverse possession may be considered. It is settled law that possession will always refer to a lawful title. Ext. D is the agreement for 1 year and Ext. A and A (1) are the two rent receipts. These exhibits show that the defendant obtained possession of the land in question by agreement. Subse­quently he stopped payment of rent. The question is whether he can raise the plea of adverse possession. Ext. 1 and Ext.7 as mentioned above show that the defendant was evicted as far back in 1961 from a part of the suit plot and when the suit was filed in 1968 it cannot be contended that the suit is barred by limitation.<br/><br/>7. Mr. Miah Abdul Gafur appearing for the defendants frankly conceded that he is in occupation of the suit premises by forcible occupation. This forcible occupation does not give him shield in a suit for declaration of title and for khas possession and mesne profit. It is well known that poss­ession is not an adverse to the rightful clai­mant owners. It is exercised in open assertion of the hostile title. Isolated fact of user cannot constitute adverse possession in law. Mr. Gafur frankly conceded that the defen­dant is in occupation of a portion of the kitchen and the latrine. Such occupation will not give rise to the claim of adverse poss­ession Plaintiff's title is found on Ext. 2 which could not be assailed by the defendant. The trial court noticed this kabala Ext. 2 and the previous suit in <em><strong>Runge Lall Mandul vs. Abdul Gaffur</strong></em> <em><strong>and others—4 Calcutta 315</strong></em> it was held when the relationship of landlord and tenant has once been proved to exist, therefore non-payment of rent though for many years, is not sufficient to show that the relationship has ceased. Next, once a tenant is sued for recovery of khas possession and mesne profit the question is whether he can raise a plea of adverse possession. The Patna High Court in <em><strong>Bastacolla Colliery Co. Ltd. vs. Bandhu Peldar and another AIR 1960 Patna (FB) 344</strong></em> considered the question and observed:<br/>"If once a tenancy of some kind comes into existence either under an express lease or under a lease implied by law, the tenant cannot convert his tenancy into a permanent one by doing act adverse to the landlord."<br/>The observation of the Patna High Court appears to have been approved by the Sup­reme Court of India in A.I.R, 1966 at 629 (at page 634).<br/><br/>8. We are in respectful agreement with this proposition that once a tenancy comes into an existence the tenant cannot convert his tenancy into a permanent on by doing any act adverse to the landlord. The Courts below noticed Ext. A. and A(1) the Bhara receipt and Ext.D the Bhara agreement. The documen­tary evidence creates the jural relationship between the plaintiff and the defendants. The plaintiff purchased the property by kabala Ext. 2 in 1961. In pursuance of the decree in T.S. No. 466 of 1958 the plaintiff of that suit sot khas posses­sion on 29-7-61 against the defendant of the present suit. As stated above, the plaintiff purchased the suit property by registered kabala dated 31st Sraban, 1368 B.S. and therefore the present plaintiff stepped into the shoes of their vendor who were the plaintiffs in T.S. No. 466 of 1958. Those circumstances show that the dispossession took place after 1961 i.e. around 1367 B. S. and not in 357 B. S. as claimed by the defendants. The trial Court was correct in holding that the dispossession took place in 1367 B.S. and not in 1357 B.S. The present plaintiff brought the suit in 1968 and therefore the trial court rightly recorded neither his suit is barred by limitation nor the defendants can raise plea of adverse possession.<br/><br/>9. In the result therefore the judgment and order of the High Court Division and the appellate Court below arc set aside and that of the learned Munsif is restored. The ap­peal is allowed with costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
