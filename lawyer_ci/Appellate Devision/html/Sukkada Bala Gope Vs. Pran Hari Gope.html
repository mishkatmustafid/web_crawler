S. Khatina No. 2324 being in the name of the original owner Kamini, Probodh and six others and suit dag No. 7066 having been recorded in the name of Kamini and Probodh Chandra Ghose, father of the petition­er Sukada Bala Gope having purchased .08 dec­imals from Kamini Bala vide deed No. 1175 dated 2.5.1932 Ext. A and Kamini Bala having been admitted as the owner of plot by both the parties and Prododh having purchased the suit plot from Kamini Bala, the recorded owner, vide Exhibit-A and the said deed being earlier than the deed of the plaintiff-respondent's pred­ecessor and the said deed Ext. A having not been challenged in any court of law High Court Division acted illegally in making the rule absolute.<br/> <br/>2. He further submits that the High Court Division's judgment dated 2.12.1999 in Civil Revision No. 182 of 1990 is wrong and per­verse and the learned Judge of the High Court Division has not applied his judicial mind on the documents and evidence of the defendant in that-<br/>(a) Exhibit-"A" registered kabala dated 02.05.1932 executed by admitted owner Kamini Bala Ghose in favour of Probodh Chandra, father of the defendant Sukkada Bala which contains Plot No. 7066.<br/>(b) Exhibit-"B" dated 19.11.1940 patta by Probodh Chandra in favour of defendant Sukkada to the extent of .04 decimal which contains Plot No. 7066.<br/>(c) 04 decimal half of Plot No. 7066 has been inherited by defendant Sukada as the only heir of her father Probodh Chandra.<br/>(d) Exhibit-"C" rent receipts which con­tain the khatian number and Plot No. 7066 measuring .08 decimal of land as mentioned in the schedule of the plaint.<br/>(e) Misread and misconstrued the docu­ments and evidence of D.Ws.<br/>(f) Entirely ignored that Exhibit "A" dated 2.5.1932 through which the defendant Sukikada claims, is earlier than Exhibit 5 dated 11.7.1935 through which the plaintiff claims.<br/>(g) Evidence of homestead of the defen­dant in Plot No. 7066 which defendant Sukkada has been possessing and her father Probodh Chandra possessed ever since the deed of sale Exhibit "A" dated 2.5.1932.<br/>(h) The learned Judge of the High Court Division abruptly came to the wrong finding that the land of the kabala Exhibit "A" is a different land and does not relate to the suit land and if the suit land does not relate to the land as contained in Exts. "A", "B" and "C" of he defendant, no relief can be sought against the defendant and the suit should be dismissed as legally misconceived. Consequently the judgment of the High Court Division should be set aside.<br/> <br/>3. The facts relevant for disposal of the appeal are that the respondents as the plaintiff filed Other Suit No. 141 of 1984 in the court of the Munsif, Sitakunda against the petitioner for declaration of title to the suit land alleging that the suit land originally belonged to Kamini Bala Ghosh who sold the same to Ramoni Mohan sold the same to Joshada Sundari Saha by a reg­istered kabala dated 5.2.1944 who died leaving Sudamoni Saha as her son's widow and the said Sudamoni Saha sold the suit land to the plaintiff by a kabala dated 9.1.1978 and since then he is in possession of the same. Defendant's name having been wrongly recorded in the B.S. Khat­ian plaintiff filed the suit for declaration of title.<br/><br/>4. Defendant-appellant contested the suit by filing written statement denying the material allegations and asserting that original owner Kamani Bala sold entire suit land to Probodh Chandra by a registered kabala dated 2.5.1932 and since then Probodh owned and possessed the same and leased out half portion of the suit land to the appellant by a registered patta dated 19.11.1940 and subsequently died  leaving behind the appellant as his only heir and as such defendant-appellant's name was correctly recorded in the B.S. Khatian and he has the right, title and possession of the same and the plaintiff has no title and possession and filed the suit to harass the defendant-appellant.<br/><br/>5. The trial Court decreed the suit and the appellate Court reversed the same. The plaintiff was successful in the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 182 of 1990 making the rule absolute thereby restoring the judgment and decree of the trial Court.<br/><br/>6. Mr. Mohammad Ozair Farooq, the learned Counsel appearing for the appellants submits that the original R.S. Khatian being No. 2324 standing in the name of Kamini, Probadh and 6 others in respect of the suit plot No. 7066 and Kamini has disposed of the entire .08 decimals of plot No. 7066 by kabala dated 2.5.1932 in favour of Probadh Chandra Ghose who in his turn leased out half of the land in favour of the appellant vide registered patta dated 19.11.1940 and the rest having been inherited by the appel­lant and the entire Khatian was recorded in the name of the appellant, the High Court Division erred in law in not holding that the suit for dec­laration of title is not maintainable and that Ext. A registered kabala dated 25.1932 is earlier in point of time as against the kabala of the plain­tiff dated 11.7.1935 from the admitted owner Kamini Bala Ghosh thereby the appellant has acquired title on the basis of Patta dated 19.11.1940 Ext. B and inheritance and that the possession of the appellant is further evident from Ext. C series rent receipts, the High Court Division misread and misconceived the docu­ments and the evidence of D. Ws. Both as regards title and possession and according erred in law in not dismissing the suit.<br/><br/>7. Mr. Subrata Chowdhury, the learned Counsel appearing for the respondent submitted that from the pleading and the evidence on record, both oral and documentary it is evident that the predecessor-in-interest Soudhamoni has been possessing the suit land inasmuch as B.S. Plot No. 7066 is different from R.S. Plot. The plaintiff has based her title on registered kabala dated 9.1.1978 and that original owner Kamini Bala has transferred the suit land to Ramoni Mohan Das by registered kabala dated 11.5.1935 (Ext. 5) who in his tern transferred to Joshada Sundari Saha by registered kabala dated 5.4.1944 (Ext. 4) and Joshada's only heir Saudhamoni sold the same to the plaintiff on 9.1.1978 (Ext.3)<br/><br/>8. It appears that the High Court Division on consideration of the material evidence on record arrived at the findings that the document filed by the plaintiff in support of their title and possession correctly and clearly proved the title and possession in the suit land and the docu­ments filed by the defendants were not relating to the suit land. The defendant though claimed title and possession partly by registered patta but did not file the kabuliyat and rent receipt showing that the patta was acted upon, moreso, the patta do not relate to the suit land so is the case with Kabala dated 2.5.1932. On the con­trary, by way of successive transfers relating back to the admitted original owner Kamini, the suit land devolved upon the plaintiff by pur­chase vide kabala dated 9.1.1978 (Ext. 3); the plaintiff as well proved rent receipts and led oral evidence showing their possession in the suit land. The trial Court as well found the title and possession of the suit land but the Court of appeal below without adverting to the reasoning of the trial Court set aside the judgment and decree of the trial Court even without reversing the finding therein.<br/><br/>9. It appears that upon proper construction of the document and the appreciation of the evidence, the trial Court decreed the suit but the Court of appeal below which is the final Court. of fact has not reversed the finding of fact arrived at by the trial Court and the High Court Division has accordingly made the rule absolute assigning good reason for the same.<br/> <br/>10. We have perused the relevant docu­ments of the parties and the evidence on record and do find any reason to differ with finding of the High Court Division recorded in the impugned judgment.<br/>In view of the above, we do not find any substance in the submissions of the learned Counsel for the appellant.<br/>The appeal is accordingly dismissed with­out any order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
