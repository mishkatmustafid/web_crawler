Ruhul Amin J. - </strong>This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 14.03.2005 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 6049 of 2001 making the Rule absolute.<br/><br/>2. The plaintiffs instituted Title Suit No.116 of 1999 in the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Dhamrai, Dhaka for a decree for permanent injunction stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit land along with other lands originally belonged to Ali Palan Bepari who died leaving behind two sons, Wazuddin Bepari and Borhanuddin Bepari alias Biramuddin Bepari and one daughter Joynab Nessa. The S.A. and R.S. records were accordingly correctly prepared and finally published in their names. Borhanuddin Bepari sold 33 decimals of land to one Moniruddin who got his name mutated and paid rent to the Government. Moniruddin died leaving behind three sons and two daughters who transferred the suit land by way of registered exchange deed dated 25.12.1995 and handed over possession to plaintiffs who got their names mutated in the record of the Revenue Department and paid rent and have been in possession. The plaintiffs threatened the bargaders in the land on 10.07.1999. Hence is the suit.<br/><br/>3. The defendant Nos.1-3 contested the suit by filing joint written statement denying the material allegations made in the plaint. Their case is that the suit land along with other lands belonged to Ali Polan Bepari and on his death his son Borhanuddin by amicable partition got 66 decimals of land and transferred the same in favour of one Joyenuddin by registered deed dated 02.12.1964. Joyenuddin died leaving behind three sons and two daughters who transferred the land along with other land by a Heba deed dated 16.07.1998 to the contesting defendants who are in possession through bargader.<br/><br/>4.  The trial Court decreed the suit. The defendants preferred the appeal being Title Appeal No. 348 of 2000 and the appellate Court allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit. The plaintiffs then moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained Rule which after hearing was made absolute.<br/><br/>5. We have heard Mr. Md. Nawab Ali, the learned Advocate-on-Record for the petitioners and Mr. Syed Mahbubur Rahman, the learned Advocate-on-Record for the respondents and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/><br/>6. It appears that the trial Court decreed the suit holding that in a suit for permanent injunction the question of title of the parties to the suit land is to be gone into incidentally and the paramount consideration in such a suit is whether the plaintiff has been in exclusive possession of the suit land. The trial Court found the plaintiff in exclusive possession of the suit land and also found prima facie title of the plaintiff in the suit land. Accordingly the trial Court decreed the suit. But the appellate Court was of the view that since question of title is involved in the suit, the trial Court was not justified in decreeing, the suit for permanent injunction.<br/><br/>7. The High Court Division held that since the suit was one for permanent injunction simplicitor, the question of title can be taken into consideration incidentally and the trial court did so. The High Court Division also held that the trial Court correctly sifted the evidence on record and found exclusive possession of the plaintiffs in the suit land. But the appellate Court erred in considering the scope of a suit for permanent injunction as the appellate Court observed that since the question of title h involved in the suit, the same should not succeed.<br/><br/>8. In view of the discussions made above, wt are of the view that the High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials or record arrived at a correct decision. There is no cogent reason to interfere with the same.<br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
