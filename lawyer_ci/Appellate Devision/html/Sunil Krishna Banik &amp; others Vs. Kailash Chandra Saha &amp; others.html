Appeal No. 105 of 1983.)<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Judgment</strong></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>                 <br/>Fazle Munim CJ.-</strong> This appeal arises from First Miscellaneous Appeal No. 105 of 1980 passed by the High Court Division, Dhaka Bench on 6.1.83.<br/><br/>2. Respondent No.1 instituted Miscella­neous Case No. 150 of 1978 under section 24 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, in the 1st court of Subordinate Judge, Mymensingh for pre-emption of .385½ acres of land recor­ded in C.S. Khatian No. 1397 and S.A. Khatian No. 1650 of Mouza Mymensingh town under Kotwali P.S. alongwith constructions thereon. His case was that 771 acres of land of the aforesaid Khatians with huts thereon belonged to one Shyamlal Saha who sold the same to respondents 1 and 2 on July 9, 1972. Respondent No. 2 sold the case land to appellants by a kabala dated 9.3.77 without notice. Respondent No. 1 is a co-sharer in the dis­puted holding but the appellants are Strangers. Respondent No. 1 obtained certified copies of the kabala on June 12, 1978 and filed the case for pre-emption on September 12, 1978. Appel­lants No. 1 and 4 contested the case by filing a written objection contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the case was barred by limitation and by principle of waiver, estoppels and acquiescence. The case land was purchased by registered kabalas dated 9.3.77 within the knowledge and with the consent of respondent No. 1. The jama of the disputed holding having already been separated in accordance with law, respondent No. 1 ceased to be a co-sharer. He could not pre-empt the case land without depositing Tk. 32,000/- the cost of construction of the huts on the case land which was incurred by the appellants. In support of their case that the holding had already been separated, two Dhakhilas dated 16.5.78 showing payment of rent for the disputed land on the basis of separated Khatians being No. 3067 and 3068 were proved and marked Exts. A and A(1). Two municipal tax receipts were also proved and marked Exts. B and B(1) show­ing payment of municipal taxes by the appel­lants for their holdings which had already been separated and numbered as holding Nos. 50 and 51. Another document, Ext. C; was also proved. The miscellaneous case was allowed by the trial court on December 27, 1979. Ap­pellants preferred First Miscellaneous Appeal. No. 105 of 1980 in the High Court Division. During the pendency of the appeal appellants filed an application under Order 41, rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure annexing certified copies of application for separation of the old jama which was registered as Mu­tation Case Nos. 1367(IX-1) 1977-78 and 1368 (IX-1)/1977-78, orders separating the old holding in the same mutation cases and the new Khatians bearing Nos. 3067 and 3068 as annexure A, A (1), B, B (1), and C(1) respec­tively. By their judgment dated 6.1.83 the learned Judges of the High Court Division rejected the application for additional evide­nce and also dismissed the appeal.<br/><br/>3. Appellants moved this Court against this judgment and obtained leave to consider whether in the face of the documentary evide­nce as above mentioned the High Court Divi­sion erred in law in not holding that the pre-emptor had ceased to be a co-sharer and in rejecting the application for additional evi­dence without giving any reason.<br/><br/>4. Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed, Counsel for the appellants, submitted that in view of the ground taken by the appellants specifically in their written objection regarding the sub-divi­sion of the tenancy concerned and also the issue formulated thereon by the trial Court, namely, "is the petitioner a co-sharer in the disputed holding", it was necessary for the ends of justice to determine the question whether the respondent No. 1 was still a co-sharer tenant in the holding at the time of filing the application for pre-emption. Had the point been determined in the negative respondent No. 1 could not have succeeded in obtaining a favourable order, from the Court allowing pre-emption. The legal position as stated by this Court in the case of <strong><em>Md. Mafizuddin Patwari Vs. Abdul Hakim Miazi, (1981) 33 DLR (AD) 505</em></strong> is that an original co-sharer who ceased to be a co-sharer of the jama cannot apply for pre-emption. Further, a co-sharer seeking pre-emption must have a subsisting interest in the holding at the time when he files an application for pre-emption and must continue to hold such interest until the case is finally disposed of. In the instant case the point involved being whether respondent No. 1 was a co-sharer tenant required the finding whether he had remained so or already ceased to be a co-sharer. It is true that appellants produced the documentary evidence, namely, the rent receipts, Exts. A and A (1) and muni­cipal tax receipts, Ext. B and B (1) and another (document Ext. C which showed that two sepa­rate municipal holdings were filed by the appellants in the trial court at a very late stages the fact remains that judgment was not yet delivered by the trial court which, there­fore could have taken a look at them and considered them for whatever worth they had. Irrespective of whether such documentary evidence would have been considered suffici­ent to prove the point involved, its relevance cannot be doubted. At the hearing of the appeal before the High Court Division against the decision of the trial court the appellants filed an application for additional evidence under Order 41, rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This application was, however, rejected by the learned Judges of the High Court Division along with the appeal. In rejecting the application for additional evidence the learned Judges observed as follows:<br/>'It appears that when O. Ps. Ws. were examined no rent-receipt or document was filed. After the examination of O. Ps. 1 to 4 was over, certain docu­ments were filed on 17.12.79 and they were marked as Exts. A, A(1), B, B (1) and C on 20.12.79. At the trial court no attempt was made by the present appellants to make out a case of separa­tion of the jama to substantiate their assertion that the pre-emptor had no subsisting interest in the holding in question."<br/>"The only ground that has been seri­ously agitated in this appeal is that the pre-emptor had already ceased to be a co-sharer and he has no <em>locus standi</em> to pray, for pre-emption. From the evidence, both oral and documentary adduced at the time of hearing of the matter, no such conclusion can be drawn. Being fully aware of their predicament the appellants have come up with an appli­cation for additional evidence. The application does not attract any of the provisions of Order 47, rule 27 of the Code. We reject the application for additional evidence.” <br/><br/>5. Further it  appears that the learned Judges noted the main argument of the appellants before them, namely, respondent No. 1, the pre-emptor had already ceased to be a co-sharer and had no <em>locus standi</em> to pre-emption, still, as the appellants failed to produce the aforesaid documentary evidence in time, while noticing their predicament the learned Judges rejected the application for additional evi­dence by holding that it did not attract any of the provisions of Order 41, rule 27 of the Code. The learned Counsel contended that since the determination of the point raised by the appellants required the consideration of the documentary evidence referred to in their application for additional evidence which ought to have been admitted. Failure to do so has, therefore, led to a conclusion without any basis.<br/><br/>6. Reference was made to the provisions of Order 41, rule 27. C.P.C. which are as follows:<br/>"27. (1) The parties to an appeal shall not be entitled to produce additio­nal evidence, whether oral or documen­tary, in the Appellate Court. But if—<br/>(a) the Court from whose decree the appeal is preferred has refused to admit evidence which ought to have been admit­ted, or<br/>(b) the Appellate Court requires any docu­ment to be produced or any witness to be examined to enable it to pronounce judgment, or for any other substantial cause, the Appellate Court may allow such evi­dence or document to be produced, or witness to be examined.<br/>(2) Wherever additional evidence is allowed to be produced by an Appellate Court, the Court shall record the reason for its admission."<br/><br/>7. Clause (b) of rule 27(1) appears to have conferred discretion on the Appellate Court to allow additional evidence in order "to enable it to pronounce judgment, or for any other substantial cause". This discretion is not subject to any other limitation or res­triction excepting what is indicated by the words used therein. To do justice is the spe­cial preserve or domain of a court of law and this has been stressed by the words used in clause (b) as aforesaid. Since the point raised by the appellants required the determination of the Court before pre-emption could be allowed, the expression of hesitation and re­fusal to admit the additional evidence does not seem to be justified. This may have occa­sioned failure of justice instead of doing it. Before judgment is pronounced by the Court there may be no harm if it considers a vital piece of evidence produced before it, though late, so that it may prevent and injustice be­ing done. It is true that such admission should not be encouraged. Power to admit additional evidence should, therefore, be sparingly used. It is, however, felt that ends of justice will be served if the additional evidence is admitted. In support of the views taken, reference is made to the cases of <strong><em>Parsotim vs. Lal Mohar, 581. A. 254 and Muhammad Siddiq Muhammad Umar vs. The Australisia Bank Ltd., PLD 1966 SC 684</em></strong>. In the first of the cases referred to above, the Judicial Com­mittee of the Privy Council while considering the provisions of Order 41, rule 27 C. P. C. observed as follows: <br/>"It is only where the appellate Court "requires" it (i. e. finds it needful) that additional evidence can be admitted. It may be required to enable the Court to pronounce judgment, or for any other substantial cause, but in either case it must be the Court that requires it. This is the plain grammatical reading of the sub-clause. The legitimate occasion for the exercise of this discretion is not whenever before the appeal is heard a party applies to adduce fresh evidence, but "when on examining the evidence as it stands, some inherent lacuna or defect becomes apparent." <br/>It was further observed: <br/>"The requirement must be the require­ment of the Court upon its appreciation of the evidence as it stands. Wherever the Court adopts  this procedure it is bound by r. 27(2) to record its reasons for so doing, and under r. 29 must spe­cify the points to which the evidence is to be confined and record on its pro­ceeding the point so specified." <br/>At the same time the Judicial Committee cautioned against the indiscriminate admission of additional evidence by the Appellate Court. Thus it was observed:<br/>"The provisions of s.107, sub-section 1(d) of the Civil Procedure Code, as elucida­ted by Order XLI, r. 27, are clearly not intended to allow a litigant who has been unsuccessful in the lower Court to patch up the weak parts of his case and fill up omissions in the appellate Court." <br/><br/>8. In the case decided by the Supreme Court of Pakistan the aforesaid observations of the Judicial Committee cautioning against allow­ing an unsuccessful litigant "to patch up the weak parts of his case and fill up omissions in the appellate Court were   noticed by the Court which, however, observed as follows: <br/>"The rules of procedure are not made "for the purpose of hindering justice" ......and, as such, we should not give such a restricted interpretation to the provisions of rule 27 of Order XLI of the Code of Civil Procedure as would, in effect, amount to tying down the hands of the appellate Court and stand in the way of doing complete justice in a cause. The rule merely prescribes that the requirement must be a genuine one and that the need for the additional evidence must be felt by the Court itself after it has examined the evidence al­ready on the record and come to the conclusion that there is apparent some inherent lacuna or defect which hinders the due administration of justice. If it comes to this conclusion, then it has the power to call for additional evidence subject to the condition that it must re­cord its reasons for doing so, in order that a higher Court may be able to ascertain that the need was   not merely imaginary but based upon factual grounds."<br/><br/>9. In the present case it must be noted that the evidence offered by the appellants to prove that the respondent was no longer a co-sharer was already produced before the trial court, but this was done only at a late stage of the trial. The evidence was not con­sidered by the trial court for this reason. It was not produced for the first time before the appellate Court. On the other hand, the exhibits referred to in their application for additional evidence could if considered ac­cording to the appellants, have shown that the respondents had ceased to be co-sharers, particularly when the necessary issue to deter­mine this point was already framed by the trial court.<br/>10. In view of the above, the appeal is allowed, Judgment of the High Court Divi­sion is set aside and the case is sent back to High Court Division for disposal in accordance with law. There will be no order as to costs.<br/>Ed. <br/> </div></div></div>
