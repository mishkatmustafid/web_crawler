Tafazzul Islam J. -</strong> This petition for leave to appeal arises out of the judgment and order dated 18th April, 2004 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 2584 of 1994 discharging the Rule which was obtained against the judgment and decree dated 30.04.94 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Jhenidah in Title Appeal No. 186 of 1990 affirming those of dated 24.06.90 passed by the learned Assistant Judge, Jhenidah in Title Suit No. 412 of 1987 dismissing the suit.<br/><br/>2. The petitioners instituted above Title Suit No. 412 of 1987 seeking declaration of title and confirmation of possession in the suit land stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that Thomas Twudi possessed the suit land through bargadars and Rakhal Chandra Ghosh and others were the holders of rent receiving interests, Thomas Twudi settled the suit land to Nagendra Bala who while in possession, on 25th Falgoon, 1358 B.S. set­tled the suit land to Sonaullah, father of the petitioners and then Sonaullah in Agrahayan 1362 B.S, executed and registered a kabuliat in favour of Nagendra Bala; after the death of Sonaullah the petitioners inherited the property left by Sonaullah; the defendant No.1 on 15<sup>th</sup> Kartic 1394 B.S, on the basis of the record of right pre­pared in his name, denied the title of the petitioners in the suit land and threatened to dispossess them there­from and hence the suit.<br/><br/>3. That defendant Nos. 8 to 9 contest­ed the suit by filing written statement contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that Thomas Twudi cultivated neel in the suit land and when neel cultivation was stopped he went back to England and then Rakhal Chandra Ghosh and others, the landlords, took back the khas posses­sion of the suit land; Rakal Chandra Ghosh died leaving behind son Satish Chandra and wife Shaila Bala; Ratikanta, another co-sharer landlord, also died leaving behind four sons namely, Mohadeb, Anil, Azit and Raj Krishna; Jagabandhu, another co-shar­er landlord, also transferred his 1/3 share to Rani Bibi by an exchange; Anil, Azit and Raj Krishna by three registered deeds dated 24.06.69 23V.02.70 and 07.08.72 transferred their lands in favour of Azazuddin, Nurul Islam and Daliluddin; there is a tank within suit plot No. 713 and non-suit plot No. 712 and the major portion of suit plot No. 713 is the bank of the tank; a hat has been established on Plot Nos. 703, 704, 714, 715, 718 and 722; Rani Bibi by deed dated 20.01.1979 gifted her share of land to Md. Ismail Mondal who by deed dated 11.04.1987 gifted the same to Daliluddin Primary School; the plaintiffs who are landless persons have been residing in a portion of the suit land by permission of the former Chairman of the local Union Council and Sahidul Islam and Bazlur Rahman have also been possessing a portion of the suit land by taking lease from the Chairman of the local Union Council. The trial court after hearing dismissed the suit. The petitioners then filed appeal and the learned Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Jhenidah, after hearing, dis­missed the appeal. The petitioner then moved the High Court Division and obtained Rule in Civil Revision No. 2584 of 1994 and after hearing the High Court Division discharged the Rule.<br/><br/>4. The learned counsel for the petition­ers submitted that the High Court Division failed to consider that the father of the petitioners had been pos­sessing the suit land since Falgun, 1658 B.S. and after his death the peti­tioners are possessing the suit land; because of their long possession for over 37 years since 1358 B.S. the petitioners acquired possessory title in the suit land; in view of the provisions of section 110 of the Evidence Act the possession of the petitioners are refer­able to the settlement made in favour of their predecessor Sonaullah in the year 1358 B.S.; the oral evidence of D.Ws. denying their purchase of .05 decimals of the land from the petition­ers by registered Kabala is not at all admissible in view of the provisions of section 91 and 92 of the Evidence Act; in view of the provisions of Order 7 Rule 7 of the Code of Civil Procedure the appellate Court ought to have ; decreed the suit in respect of 85 decimals out of 90 decimals of land excluding .05 decimals of land which was purchased by Fazlur Rahman and Abdus sobhan form the petitioners; the  High Court Division failed to consider that the trial courts as well as the appellate Court misread and misconstrued the evidence on record which clearly established the possession of the petitioners in the suit land for over 37 years and also acquiring of title by settlement made in favour of Sonaullah in the year 1358 B.S.<br/><br/>5. As it appears the trial court dismissed the suit on the findings that Kabuliyet Ext. 1 (C) dated 14.12.1955 had no legal validity after 13.12.1955 in view of the provisions of section 75A of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950; the petitioners claimed that they acquired title to the suit land on the basis of their settlement by Nagendra Bala to Sonaullah, the predecessor of the petitioners but could not prove that they possessed the entire suit land; the suit is also bad for non-joinder of Abdus  Sobhan and Bazlur Rahman in the suit. The lower appellate court dismissed the appeal on the findings that the documents of settlement on the basis of which the petitioners claimed title, being forged, the petitioners did not acquire any title to the suit land; the petitioners not being in possession of the entire suit land are not entitled to a decree for declaration of title to the suit land; the petitioners by amendment of the plaint claimed relief for confirmation of possession along with declaration of title but did not put in requisite court fees for the relief of confirmation of pos­session.<br/><br/>6. As it  appears the High Court Division discharged the Rule holding that both the courts below concurrent­ly found that the plaintiffs could not prove their possession in the entire suit land; the decisions cited by the learned Advocate of the petitioners do not sup­port the contention of the petitioners that a decree may be passed even if the plaintiff is found not in possession of the entire suit land and the settled law is that in a suit for declaration of title and confirmation of possession if the plaintiff fails to prove his possession in the entire suit land he is not entitled to a decree even if he proved his title to the suit land; though Exts.4 and 4(A), the rent receipts, are not forged as found by the appellate court but even then this position will not in any way improve the case of the petitioners as they failed to prove their possession in the entire suit land.<br/><br/>7. We are of the view that the High Court Division on proper considera­tion of the materials on record and applying the principle of law as appli­cable arrived at a correct decision and there is not cogent reason to interfere with the same.<br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
