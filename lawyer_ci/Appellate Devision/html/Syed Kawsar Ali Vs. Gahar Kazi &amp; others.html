The appellant as plaintiff instituted Title Suit No.134 of 1974 in the Court of Munsif, Sadar, Faridpur, for declaration title and permanent injunction restraining defendants Nos.1 and 2, respondents, from entering into the suit land comprising plot No. 1071 and 1072.<br/><br/>3. The suit land originally belonged to one Makhan Bala Bashu who sold the same to defendant No.1, Gahar Kazi by a registered sale deed dated 5.5.69. Thereafter defendant No. 3 purchased it from defendant No.1 by a registered kabala dated 17.1.70 and he in turn sold it to plaintiff on 13.8.73. It seems that defendant No.2 purchased the same property from defendant No.1 by a registered kabala Ext. A dated 15.1.70. which not only comprise the suit plots Nos.1071 and 1072 but also included plot No. 580 an area of .02 decimals of mouza Kanakpur under P. S. Kashiani The plaintiff contended that the defendant 2 by his fraudulent and fictitious document was threatening the forcible posse­ssion. Hence this suit.<br/>The defendant No. 2 resisted the suit by claiming that he purchased it from defendant No.1 by a registered kabala Ext. A, therefore, the defendant No.3 had no subsisting interest for transferring any property to the plaintiff. It will be at once noticed that the date of defendant No.2's kabala is 15.1.70 and the date of the kabala of defendant No.3 is 17.1.70. In other words there is a margin of two days between the two kabalas. The plaintiff contended that the defendant No. 2 in order to give jurisdiction to a different Sub-registrar Office purposely included a fictitious plot being Plot No.580 of Mouza Nanakpur under P.S. Kashiani and for the purpose of registration of the kabala, it was done deliberately.<br/><br/>4. The trial court though found that the Ext. A was a fictitious kabala inasmuch as it included a non-existing plot dismissed the suit of the plaintiff, on the finding that the, defendant 2 will not be bound by the fraud if committed by his vendor defendant No.1 and the defendant No. 2 is a bonafide purchaser and therefore acquired right in the property.<br/><br/>5. The plaintiff thereafter filed appeal before the appellate court below which rev­ersed the finding of the learned Munsif hol­ding  that the impugned kabala dated 15.1.70 having included nonexistent and fictitious property only to give jurisdiction upon the Sub-Registrar of Kashiani, the  said deed is void under  section  28  of the Registration Act and  as  such  it transferred no interest to defendant No. 2 It was further found that the plaintiff and defendant No.3 were not party to the kabala Ext. A and they are not bound by it. Accordingly it decreed the plaintiff's suit.<br/><br/>6. Defendant No. 2 filed second appeal and the learned Single Judge took the view that the right of the transferee (Defendant No.) 2 under the sale deed shall not be invali­dated in view of the fact that there was no evidence that the defendant No.2 was in col­lusion with defendant No.1. Reliance was placed on Section 28 of the Registration Act and the decisions reported in <strong><em>ILR 1914 Calc­utta at page 972 and AIR 1925</em></strong> Madras at page 430.<br/>The learned Single Judge observed:  <br/>"In the absence of any evidence on record to show that the transferee of the sale deed, dated 15.1.70 (Ext.1) had any secret dishonest understanding with the vendor in including a fictitious property in the sale deed, the right of the trans­feree arising under the sale deed shall not be invalidated in view of the Registration Act. This legal aspect of the matter had not been taken into consideration by the learned Court of appeal below causing an error affecting the merit of the case and it cannot stand the scrutiny of law." <br/>Analysis of the evidence shows the plaintiff's possession of the suit land. The appellate court below considered the evidence of the plaintiff’s witnesses regarding possession and the evidence of P.Ws. 3, 4 and 5 cogently proved that the plaintiff was in possession of the suit land. On documentary evidence it was observed that Exts. 2 series show payment of rent of the suit land by the plaintiff and his predecessor in interest since the time of pur­chase from defendant No.1. It was observed by the appellate court below: <br/>"On the other hand defendant No. 2 has not filed a single Dakhila to show the payment of rent for the suit land at any point of time."  <br/>On analysis of the evidence of the defence witnesses about possession, the appellate court below found it unsatisfactory. The appellate court below noticed the contest between the kabala of defendant No.1 in favour of defendant No.3 dated 17.1.70 Ext.1 (a). The kabala by defendant No. 2 from defendant No.1 is Ext.1 dated 15.1.70 the trial court found that since Ext. A is prior in point of time then that of Ext.1 (a) and the defendant No. 2 played no fraud in getting the kabala Ext. A defendant No. 2 has acquired valid title by Ext. A. This finding has been reversed by the appellate court below on the application of section 28 of the Registration Act inasmuch as inclusion of .02 acres of land of schedule 2 of the kabala Ext. A by plot No. 580 of mouza Kanakpur is a fictitious and non-existent one. The appellate court below considered clause (b) of sub-section (2) of sub-section 28 and came to the conclusion that the protection is not available inasmuch as neither the plaintiff nor defendant No. 3 was a party to the kabala Ext. A and as such they are not bound by it. The appellate court below observed: <br/>"It is only the parties to document be bound by kabala containing nonexistent or fictitious land only to attract the jurisdiction of a Sub-Registration office within meaning of sub-clause (a) of clause (2) of section 28 of the Registration Act. According to true interpretation of sub-clause (b) of section 28 of the Registration Act as it stands now after the amendment in 1962 parties not being parties to the kabala for a fictitious or non-existent land can reasonably show that kabala like Ext. A is invalid for all intents and purposes." <br/>Section 28 of the Registration Act is in the following terms: <br/>"S.28 Place for registering documents relating to land (1) save as in this Part otherwise provided every document men­tioned in section 17, sub-section (1), clauses (a), (b) (c) (d) and (e), section 17, subsection (2) and section 18 inso­far as such document affects immovable property shall be presented for registra­tion in the office of a Sub-Registrar within whose sub-district the whole or some portion of the property to which such document relates is situate''. <br/><br/>7. The Registration (Amendment) Ordinance, 1962 added sub-section (2) to this section which reads as under:<br/>"(2) Notwithstanding anything con­tained in sub-section (1)—<br/>(a) After a document is registered, no party thereto shall be entitled to question the validity of its registration on the ground that the   property which  purported  to give jurisdiction to the Sub-Registrar to register it either did not exist or was fictitious or insignificant or was not intended to be conveyed and<br/>(b) A document the registration of which is secured by the inclusion of non-existent, fictitious or insignificant/portion or item shall not in any manner affect the rights of, a person who was not a party thereto and acquired rights in the property with­out, notice of the transaction to which such document relates." <br/>Following the decision of the Privy Council in the case of <strong><em>Harendra Lal Chowdhury vs. Haridashi Devi 41 IA. 110</em></strong>, the question of inclusion of fictitious land in a deed of sale has been set at rest. The question was whe­ther such inclusion is fraud in the law of registration. The Privy Council pointed out;  <br/>"Such an entry intentionally made use of by the parties for the purpose of ob­taining registration in a district where no part of the property actually charged and intended to be charged in fact exists is a fraud on the registration law, and no registration obtained by means thereof is valid. To hold otherwise would amount to saying that mortgages rela­ting solely to land in other parts of the Presidency could be validly registered by the sub-registrar at Calcutta if the parties merely took the precaution to add, as a last parcel, Government House, Calcutta, or any similar item." <br/>The Privy Council, therefore, pointed out that registration was invalid as no portion of the property relating solely to land was situated within the jurisdiction of the Sub-registrar as required by section 28.<br/><br/>8. In Collector of<strong><em> Gorukhpur Vs. Ram Swidar Mal 61, I. A. 286</em></strong>, the vendor in or­der to secure registration included in the sale deed a small cover platform in one third share in a garden-room but for which there was no access and which was not capable of being utilised or enjoyed by the purchaser. It was not intended by either party that the platform should be the subject of sale. The Privy Council observed: The word “ficti­tious” used in <strong><em>Harendra Lal's case</em></strong> is not con­fined to non-existing property; it is satisfied if the deed does not relate to a specified pro­perty for any effective purpose of enjoyment or use. The registration was, therefore, invalid.<br/>Thereafter series of decisions were given by various High Courts in the sub-continent categorising the class of cases where the registration will be valid or invalid. For instance, in <strong><em>Pahaladi vs. Musammat Laraiti 41 All. 22</em></strong> it was held where property is "ad­mittedly in existence is included in the deed which both parties intended to be the sub­ject matter of transfer, the fact that the transferer is not able to make out a good title will not invalidate registration. This type of cases was distinguished by the Privy Council, in <strong><em>Biswanaih</em></strong> <strong><em>vs. Chandra Narayan Chowdhury's case 48 Indian Appeal 127 </em></strong>where it was pointed out: <br/>“that none of the parties ever intended that the one Kauri share in Mouza Kolhua should vest in Udit or should pass by the mortgage from him to mort­gagee. This case differs to Caelo from the case suggested in argument of a mere failure to make a good title to property dealt with by the instrument and which both parties had  intended should form part of the security." <br/>In <strong><em>Pahaladi’s case</em></strong> the property was inexistence and in<strong><em> Biswanath's</em></strong> case though the mouza existed, the mortgagor had no interest in it and the parties never intended that it should form part of the security. In <strong><em>Hari Ram Vs Sheodiul Ram 16 I.A. 12</em></strong> the Privy Council observed that section 28 is satisfied by registration being effected in the place where any portion of the registered property is situated It is not necessary that such por­tion should be a substantial one.<br/>Again, in the case of <strong><em>Nurunnessa Khatun 39, CWN 120</em></strong> the registration was held valid at Dhaka when the sale-deed conveyed specified property in a saham which had fallen to the vendor's share in partition and a tin-shed was a non-existence and the regis­tration at Dhaka would have been invalidat­ed were it not for the fact that there was a further provision that if the partition should prove to be invalid the deed should take effect as a sale property inherited by the vendor in the district of Dhaka. In view of the alternative provision the registration at Dhaka was valid.<br/><br/>9. A sells immovable property to B and delivers possession to B; but the parties in­cluded in the deed a small parcel which does not belong to A and which is situate in another place in order to attain registration in the office of the Sub registrar of that place. A subsequently sues B to recover possession. B relies on the sale deed and A pleads that it is inadmissible and is not validly registered. It was held in <strong><em>Venkatrawari Vs. Venkata Suffayya 55 Mad. 507</em></strong> that his plea is not open to A for no one alleging his own baseness ought to be heard and B is entitled to remain in possession for in <em>pan delicto potior est condition possidentis</em> i.e. in equal fault to the condition of the possessor is more favourable.<br/><br/>10. Analysing the reported decisions the Bombay High Court in <strong><em>AIR 1954 Bombay 54</em></strong> considered (at page 62). <br/>"Various circumstances may arise in case of unwarranted inclusion of pro­perty in a deed. For instance, a pro­perty may not in fact exist at all and still be included to enable registration being effected in a particular place and maybe a fictitious inclusion in that sense. In such a case registration is invalid: <strong><em>1914 P. C. 67 (15)</em></strong>; Secondly, the property may exist, but the grantor has no title to it, and neither party to the deed intends to include it as a fact as a subject-matter of the deed. In such a case also regis­tration is invalid: <strong><em>1921 P.C.8 (16)</em></strong>; Thir­dly, the property exists but is not proved to belong to the grantor and still there is a bonafide belief at least on the part of the grantee that it belongs to the grantor. In such a case registration is not invalid, and the burden is on the party challenging the validity to prove, that the inclu­sion of the property was intended to be fictitious by both the parties: <strong><em>1919 All. 450 (19), 1924 All; 897(20) and obser­vations in 1921 P.C.8 (16)."</em></strong> <br/><br/>In<strong><em> Akamat Ali vs. Abdul Hai (1956) 8 DLR 679=PLD 1957 Dhaka 165</em></strong> it was held that the onus to prove validity of registration shifts on the person relying on the document.<br/>11. In view of the aforesaid decisions the law was amended in 1962 and sub section (2) bad been added to section 28. Sub-section (2) provides notwithstanding anything con­tained in sub-section (1) no party thereto shall be entitled to question the validity of its registration on the ground that the property either did not exist or was fictitious, etc. The expression "no party" means defendant Nos.1 and 2 but not defendant No.3 because he has not been mentioned here. In other words it was the vendor and vendee of Ext. A namely, defendant No.1 and defendant No. 2 who are precluded from questioning the validity of registration on the ground that the property did not exist or was fictitious or insignificant or was not  intended to be con­veyed and the registration was invalid. It may be noted in <strong><em>16 I.A.112</em></strong> the property was insignificant but registration was valid. Then clause (b) provides that a document the registration of which is secured by the inclu­sion of a non-existent, fictitious or insignifi­cant portion or item shall not in any manner affect the rights of who was not a party there­to and acquired rights in the property without notice of the transaction to which such docu­ments relate. While clause (a) precludes the parties from challenging the validity of regis­tration, clause (b) affords protection to third party and such document "shall not in any mariner effect the rights of a person who was not a party thereto and acquired rights in the property without notice ,of the transaction to which such document, relates." Clause (b), therefore, clearly gives protection to defendant No.3 because his document Ext.1 though apparently later in time, his title conveyed by defendant No.1 will not be affected inas­much as he was not a party to the document of Ext. A executed by defendant No. 2 on 15.1.70. It is clear, therefore, that the protec­tion is available for defendant No.3 and unfortunately, this point was missed by the learned Single Judge. The High Court Divi­sion relied on <strong><em>AIR 1925 Mad. 430</em></strong> where it was held that where no collusion by the mortgagee to assists fraud by the mortgagor in respect of the registration of the document as been made, out, the registration is not invalid, at least so far as the interests of the mortgages are concerned. This decision has no manner of application because in the in­stant case the interest of a third party has been affected by fraudulent registration with an entry of fictitious non-existent property for the purpose of conferring jurisdiction in a different Sub-registration Office, and on the Strength of 'such kabala the suit for specific performance of contract of the plaintiff was resisted.<br/>In the result, therefore, the appeal is allo­wed with costs. The judgment and order of the High Court Division is set aside and those of the appellate court below restored.<br/>Ed.     </div></div></div>
