She is challenging an order of the High Court Division dated 3 Septem­ber 1986 setting aside an order of the Executing Court, namely the Subordinate Judge, who had di­rected the appointment of an Advocate Commission­er to ascertain the value of a part of her building for payment of compensation to her by the decree-holders who were given a decree for khas possession over a land including this part of the building. Re­spondents obtained a preliminary decree in her partition suit (O.C. Suit No. 52 of 1972) for a saham of .13 decimals of land out of a total area of .31 deci­mals. The preliminary decree was made final on 9.8.84 upon an Advocate Commissioner's report which was made part of the decree. By that final de­cree the respondents were allotted the saham of .13 decimals and it was directed that they would be given khas possession of the land including a part of the judgment-debtor building. When the decree was sought to be put into execution in O.C. Execution Case No. 5 of 1984, the judgment-debtor objected to the execution contending that the value of the part of her building should be ascertained through an Advo­cate Commissioner for the purpose of compensation to be paid by the decree-holders. The Executing Court allowed her prayer and appointed an Advocate Commissioner; but in revision the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division (Civil Revision No.229 of 1986, Rangpur Bench), set aside the order of the Executing Court and directed that the Execu­tion Proceeding should proceed. This order of the High Court Division is now under challenge before us.<br/><br/>2. Mr. Abdul Malek learned Advocate for the petitioner, first of all tried to show us that the judg­ment-debtor's petition for appointment of an Advo­cate Commissioner by the Executing Court is main­tainable under section 151 C.P.C. The learned Counsel has tried to argue that as there is no other provision of law for ascertainment of value of a part of the building which fell to the decree-holders' share, provisions of section 151 C.P.C. are applica­ble. We do not think that this contention is tenable. For, remedy sought in the application goes into the merit of the decree itself in which rights and liabili­ties of the parties have been conclusively determined. Under this decree, decree-holders are not liable to pay any compensation for demolition of a part of the building which fell to their saham. Function of the Executing Court is strictly limited to execution of the decree as it is. It appears that after the prelimi­nary decree was passed an Advocate Commissioner appointed by the Court made local investigation but the judgment-debtor did not co-operate with him, that the Advocate Commissioner gave the plaintiffs a saham of .13 decimals including a part of the judg­ment-debtor's building and a latrine since these struc­tures fell within the plaintiffs' saham of .13 decimals out of which .4 decimals of land was found in pos­session of the defendant-judgment-debtor. The Advo­cate Commissioner submitted his report which was accepted and made part of the final decree without any objection. In the circumstances, the Executing Court got no authority to go beyond the decree and award compensation to the judgment-debtor who is however at liberty to remove her structure taking permission of the Executing Court.<br/><br/>3. The learned Counsel has tried to invoke sec­tion 51 of the Transfer of Property Act and contended that as a transferee the judgment-debtor is entitled to compensation for demolition of her building con­structed bonafide in a land which, subsequent to her transfer, became property of another person. Facts established in the suit however do not appear to sup­port the judgment-debtor's claim as to compensation as a bonafide transferee. Out of the total area of .31 decimals of the suit land, which had belonged to de­fendant No.5, plaintiffs first purchased .13 decimals and after them defendants Nos. 1-3 purchased .12 dec­imals leaving only .06 decimals which was pur­chased, last of all, by defendant No.4 the judgment-debtor, Now it is found that he is in unauthorised possession of .4 decimals out of the plaintiffs' .13 decimals and it is this part of land under unauthorised possession of .4 decimals on which the disputed con­structions were made. The construction is, therefore, not bonafide. In any case, to ascertain value of the part of the judgment-debtor's building so as to com­pensate him at plaintiffs' cost falls outside the power of the Executing Court and as such the order ap­pointing an Advocate Commissioner has been right­ly set aside by the High Court Division. We find nothing to interfere.<br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
