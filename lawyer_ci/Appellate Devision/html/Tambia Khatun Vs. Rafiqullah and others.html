The appellant instituted Miscellaneous Case No. 86 of 1991 under section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 for pre-empting. 24 acres of land transferred by respondent No. 2 in favour of respondent No. 1 by a deed of exchange dated 8.6.91. Her case was that she was a co-sharer in the holding along with respondent No.2 who transferred the portion of the holding along with respon­dent No. 2 who transferred the portion of the holding by the so-called deed of exchange without service of notice upon her as required under section 89(4) of the Act. The land transferred is a part of <em>ejmali</em> tank and homestead of the appellant and respondent No.2. Her further case was that although the land was transferred but respondent No. 1 was not inducted into pos­session of the same. Respondent No.2 also transferred previously some other land from the said holding to stranger-purchasers without serving notice upon the appellant and the appellant by instituting pre-emption case got those lands pre-empted in her fabour. The present transfer is a devise to defeat the right of pre-emption of the appel­lant by creating a deed of exchange. Respondent No. 2 on 19.10.91 retransferred 4½ gandas of land to respondent No. 1 on 15.10.91 when a son of the appellant went to catch fish from the tank respondent No. 1 and husband of respondent No.2 raised objection and disclosed about the transfer of the portion of the said holding to him.<br/><br/>3. Respondent No. 1 contested the case by filing a written objection contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the case was barred by limi­tation and that transfer of a portion of the tank and homestead was effected by a deed of exchange and not be sale.<br/><br/>4. The learned Assistant Judge, Luxmipur, dismissed the case holding that the transfer in question was by way of ewaz and not by sale and that the Miscellaneous case was also barred by limitation.<br/><br/>5. The appellant against that Judgment and order filed Miscellaneous Appeal No. 7 of 1993 in the court of the learned District Judge, Laxmipur. The appellant Court on contest set aside the Judgment and order of the Trial Court and allowed the appeal and allowed pre-emption case by its judgment and order dated February 7, 1994 on the findings that the case was not barred by limitation and that the transfer is a sale and not an exchange. Respondent No. 1 against the judgment and decree of the appellate court moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction in Civil Revision No. 863 of 1994. The learned Single Judge after hearing the Rule set aside the Judgment and order of the lower appellate court and restored that of the trial court and made the Rule absolute.<br/><br/>6. Leave was granted to consider whether the High Court Division was Justified in interfering with the findings of fact arrived at by the lower appellate court and findings of fact arrived at by the lower appellate court and further whether the learned Judge was right in holding that "in a pre-emption preceding court is not competent to decide whether the transfer in question is an exchange or sale" and whether the transfer in question was immune from pre-emption under section 96(10)(b) of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950.<br/><br/>7. Mr. Sharifuddin Chaklader learned Advocate for the appellant urges that as the lower appellate court being the final court of fact arrived at the findings that the transfer in question is a sale and not an exchange on consideration of oral evidence on record the learned Single Judge fell in error of law in setting aside the Judgment of the lower appellate court without adverting to the reasoning of the lower appellate court and in holding that the court can not ques­tion the nature of transaction in a pre-emp­tion case by adducing oral evidence. He fur­ther argues that the learned Judge failed to consider that respondent No. 1 having pur­chased the case land on 19.10.91 the deed of ewaz was created for the purpose of defeating the right of preemption of the appellant.<br/><br/>8. On the other hand, Mr. S.R. Karmaker in view of the legal position felt difficulty in supporting the judgment of the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division.<br/><br/>9. It appears from the judgment and order of the learned Single Judge that he held" no oral evidence contrary to the facts recorded in the deed in question is admissi­ble in evidence" and the evidence adduced by the witnesses of the appellant being contrary to the averments recorded in the deed of exchange the lower appellate court wrongly held that the pre-emption case was not barred under section 96(10)(b) of the Act.<br/><br/>10. Section 96(10)(b) of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 reads as follows:<br/>"(10) Nothing in this section shall apply to-<br/>a transfer to a co-sharer in the tenancy whose interest has accrued otherwise than by purchase; or<br/>(b) a transfer by exchange or partition; <br/><br/>11. From the aforesaid provision we are unable to read that no oral evidence can be adduced for determining the nature of trans­fer of a holding or a portion there of which is effected by an exchange deed. The learned Single Judge, it seems to us, made a mistake in holding that no oral evidence can be adduced to decide the nature of transfer in the pre-emption proceeding presumably in view of section 91 and 92 of the evidence Act, 1872.<br/><br/>12. Section 91 of the Evidence Act is about the manner of proof of a document which has been reduced to the form of a document and which is required by law to be reduced to the forms of a document. The document itself has to be proved, or where secondary evidence is admissible, second­ary evidence of its contents may be proved. The terms of the document cannot be proved by any other mode of proof. The impugned kabala has been proved under Section 91.<br/><br/>13. Section 92 of the Evidence Act pro­vides that when a document described in Section 91 has been proved according to Section 91, "no evidence of any oral agreement or statement shall be admitted, as between the parties to any such instrument or their representatives in interest, for the purpose of contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting from, its terms."<br/><br/>14. In this case, the contest is between the pre-emptor and the pre-emtee as to whether the kabala in question was a sale or an ewaz. The pre-emptor was not a party to the document. She is perfectly at liberty to question the nature of the transaction and the pre-emption court has full jurisdiction to entertain the pre-emptee's challenge.<br/><br/>15. In this view of legal position we hold that the learned Single Judge fell in serious error of law in holding that no oral evidence can be adduced to decide the nature of a transfer sought to be pre-empted.<br/>16. Accordingly, we set aside the Judgment and order of the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division, allow this appeal and restore the Judgment and order of the lower appellate court. There will be no order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
