Rahman</strong>) on 3rd May 1983.<br/><br/>2. Plaintiff-respondents filed a suit being Other Class Suit No.1 of 1966 against the Government in the 3rd Court of Subordinate Judge, Mymensingh for declaration of their title to the suit land and that their possession was not unauthorised and that the entry of the name of Government in record of rights was wrong. On behalf of the Government it was contend­ed that the suit land vested in the Government as a result of Government Gazette Notification No. 1524 dated 21st December 1957 and that the forest depart­ment is in possession of the suit land. Further, the documents of plaintiff-respondents arc fraudulent, they having no right, title and interest in the suit land.<br/><br/>3. Trial Court decreed the suit. Against the judg­ment Government preferred an appeal being First Appeal No.22 of 1970 before the High Court Divi­sion. During the pendency of the appeal appellant filed an application under section 4(2) of the Attia Forest (Protection) Ordinance, 1982 for an order of abatement of the suit. The learned Judges of the High Court Division held that the appeal and not the suit filed by the respondents has abated in view of the provisions of the aforesaid Ordinance.<br/><br/>4. Being aggrieved Government-appellant moved this Court and obtained special leave to ap­peal to consider whether the High Court Division on a wrong interpretation of the clear provisions of the aforesaid section [4(2)] arrived at the conclusion as above.<br/><br/>5. Mr. B.Hossain, Assistant Attorney-General, submitted that the C.S. plot of Mouza Beltail, P.S. Mirjapur mentioned in the Notification No.11309 Forest, dated 23rd June, 1928 appears in serial No.22 of the Schedule mentioned in section 3 of the Attia Forest (Protection) Ordinance, 1982 and it includes the suit plot Nos.651,636,646,699,626 and 58. Re­ferring to the provisions of section 4(2) of the afore­said Ordinance he submitted that the suit filed by the plaintiff- respondents has abated.<br/><br/>6. Mr.M.H. Khondkar, Counsel for the plain­tiff-respondents, submitted that the plaintiffs pur­chased some lands of plot No.58 from different per­sons who took pattan from Deldoar Estate and the rest of the land of the said plot was taken settlement of by them on payment of rent. Plaintiffs also pur­chased out of plot Nos.626, 646 and 651 from differ­ent persons who had taken pattan of these plots. Plaintiffs are in possession of these plots for more than 30 years and have also got their dwelling house in plot No.58. These lands were wrongly recorded in the name of the Government in the recent record of rights. The learned Counsel submitted that as the suit had been disposed of long before the passing of Or­dinance No. XXXIII of 1982 the suit cannot be said to have retrospectively abated. In support of the judgment of the High Court Division the learned Counsel submitted that the suit having been disposed of long ago and therefore, being not pending the principle that appeal is the continuation of the suit is not attracted in the present case for directing abate­ment of the suit by virtue of the aforesaid provisions of the Ordinance.<br/><br/>7. To decide the point raised in this appeal it is necessary to look into the provisions of section 4(2) of the Ordinance No.XXXIII of 1982. They are:<br/>"<strong>4. Abatement of legal proceedings.-</strong> (1) The Constitution of Reserved Forest as is re­ferred to in section 3 shall not be called in question on any ground whatsoever before any Court.<br/>(2) All suits, appeals, petitions, applica­tions, and other legal proceedings pending im­mediately before the commencement of this Or­dinance in any Court against the Government or any of its Officers in which the Constitution of the reserved forest or the Notification, as are re­ferred to in section 3 has been called in question in any manner whatsoever shall abate forthwith and shall not be further proceeded with."<br/><br/>8. On reading these provisions the learned Judg­es of the High Court Division found that the suits, appeals, petitions, applications and other legal-pro­ceedings that were pending immediately before the commencement of the Ordinance in any Court shall abate. They further reasoned that the section did not say anything about the suits already disposed of and therefore, the present suit could not be said to have abated in pursuance of the aforesaid provisions. The learned Judges, therefore, concluded that in order to attract section 4(2) of the Ordinance there must be a pendency of the suit but if it had already been dis­posed of, the section could not be applied for direct­ing the abatement of the suit. The principle that ap­peals are continuation of a suit were not, in their opinion, applicable in the present case so as to hold that the appeal pending before the High Division abated.<br/><br/>9. To appreciate the point raised by the learned Assistant Attorney-General mere reference to the disposal of the suit before the commencement of the aforesaid Ordinance is bound to be misleading as ap­pears from the impugned judgment of the High Court Division. No reason excepting that the suit was already disposed of when the Ordinance came into force, has been stated in support of the view that the principle of the appeal being the continuation of the suit is not attracted in the present case for the purpose of abatement of the suit. If the suit must be pending when the Ordinance was passed for the pur­pose of the abatement under section 4(2), it cannot be said that it was not so pending during the appeal. When an appeal is preferred against any judgment passed in a suit what the Appellate Court is required to do, either in allowing or dismissing the appeal. Does it not affirm or set aside the judgment and order passed in the suit itself? If so, can it be said that the suit was not pending when an appeal against the judgment passed in a suit is before the Appellate Court? As has been said by the learned Judges of the High Court Division that the suit was already disposed of before the commencement of the Ordi­nance, then what about the appeal? Is it standing in a vacuum? If the suit is knocked off, the appeal it­self cannot stand- It would, therefore, seem that the conclusion of the learned Judges of the High Court Division is not tenable. Moreover, the wording of section 4(2) does not indicate that the suit from which an appeal is pending has not been intended to abate the very object and purpose of the Ordinance would stand defeated, if it is held that the suit of the nature mentioned in the Ordinance shall not abate, though an appeal is pending against it before any Court, The intention of the Legislature must be dis­covered from the legislation itself. It will, therefore, be in accord with legislative intention behind the Or­dinance concerned if it is agreed that the suit out of which the appeal arose has abated in view of the aforesaid provisions. Apart from these considera­tions, on reference 10 section 3 of the Ordinance, it is seen that the constitution of Attia Forest cannot be challenged as being invalid. Section 3 of the Ordi­nance provides as follows:<br/>“ Notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary to the Forest Act, 1927 (XVI of 1927) in any other law for the lime being in force or in any judgment, Decree or Order, the lands comprising of 59,648.70 acres constituting a Re­served Forest known as the Attia Forest under Notification mentioned in the schedule shall, not withstanding any defect in such constitution or notification, be deemed to have been validly constituted a reserved Forest and the notification so issued shall be deemed to have had effect ac­cordingly."<br/><br/>10. The suit plots in serial No.22 of the Sched­ule under section 3 of the aforesaid Ordinance were also included in Notification No. 11309 dated 23rd June 1928. This Notification which was passed dur­ing British Rule is as follows:<br/><u>"Notification</u><br/>No. 11309 Dacca.<br/>Mymensingh.<br/>For: The 23rd June 1928-- Whereas by notification No.588 T.B.dated the 23rd Septem­ber 1925, issued under section 4 of the Indian Forest Act, 1878 (VXI of 1878), <em>(Sic) </em>and pub­lished at page 1641, part 1 of the Calcutta Ga-of the 15th October 1925, the Governor in 5 pleased to declare his proposal to certain areas the forest known as the Forest in the districts of Dacca and Mymensingh as reserved forest and appointed For­est Settlement Officers to enquire into and de­termine the existence nature and extent of any rights alleged to exist in favour of any person in or over land comprised within such area or in or over any forest produce and to deal with the same, and<br/>Whereas the Forest Settlement Officers have completed their record in respect of the ar­eas comprised in the cadastral plots of mouzas Retail jurisdiction list No. 195, Ajgana, jurisdic­tion list No. 198, Chiteswari, Jurisdiction list No.200, Telina, jurisdiction list No.207, police-station Mirzapur, in the aforesaid forest known as the Attia Forest, as mentioned below, and the time for preferring appeal has expired, and all appeals have been disposed of, and<br/>Whereas the event necessary in the case un­der section 19 of the aforesaid Act have occurred.<br/>Now, therefore, in exercise of the power conferred by section 20 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927 (XVI of 1927), the Governor in Council is pleased to declare the areas comprised in the ca­dastral plots described below to be a reserved forest with effect fro0om the 15th August 1928. The approximate total area is 2054.08 acres:<br/><u>Schedule</u><br/>Name of Mouzas Cadastral plots</div><table align="left" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td style="height: 84px; width: 156px; text-align: justify;">Baltail, jurisdiction list No, 195<br/>			Police Station, Mirzapur.</td><td style="height: 84px; width: 288px; text-align: justify;">5, 8, 10, 21,23,24,25, 27, 30, 31<br/>			34. 52 (excluding its bata plot 1166, area '10 acre) 54, 57, 58,103,205.<br/>			626,636, 640,651,657,663, 1161, 1163), 699, 646, 1146</td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>A copy of the map showing the plots mentioned in the Schedule may be seen in the office of the Col­lector of Mymensingh.<br/>W.H.Nelson,<br/>Secretary to the Government of<br/>Bengal (Offg.)."<br/><br/>11. It is clear that the plaintiff-respondents title to the suit land cannot be declared unless section 3 of the Ordinance and the Notification mentioned therein are struck down as invalid.<br/><br/>12. It may, however, incidentally be mentioned that the Forest Act, 1927 (XVI of 1927) under which the reserved Forest were, in the past, and are, in the present, constituted contains elaborate provi­sions regarding the remedy of persons aggrieved by any wrongful inclusion of lands belonging to them. No such remedy as provided in the Act appears to have been sought for by the plaintiff-respondents in the present case.<br/><br/>13. In view of the foregoing considerations the appeal is allowed. The judgment of the Courts below are set aside. Other Class Suit No.1 of 1966 out of which this appeal has arisen stands abated with ef­fect from llth September 1982. There will, howev­er, be no order as to costs.<br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
