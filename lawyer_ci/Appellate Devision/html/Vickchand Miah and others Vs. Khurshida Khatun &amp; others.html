In this appeal, defendant Nos. 1-3 are the appellants while plaintiff Nos. 1 and 2 are the respondents.<br/><br/>2. The patent facts are that one Abdul Brake was the owner in possession of the suit land. He used to live with his wife plaintiff No. 1, khorsheda Khatun and her son plaintiff No. 2, Dhan Mia by her former husand. On 17 October 1983 Abdul Barek executed a deed of <em>heba-bil-ewaz</em> in respect of the said land in favour of Khorsheda Khatun and Dhan Mia in exchange of a Holy Quran. Upon a prayer made to the Registering Officer, Raipura under sec­tion 38(2) of the Registration Act Abdul Barek was examined on commission and the docu­ment was ultimately registered on 23 October 1983. Abdul Barek thereafter died. But a kabala being number 709 was registered on 12 February 1984 at Belabo Sub-Registry Office in respect of the self same land. The said kabala purported to have been executed by Abdul Barek on 14 October 1983 in favour of his con­sanguine brother's son-Vickchand Miah (defen­dant No. 1) and his consanguine sister's son-Abdul Motaleb (defendant No. 3), besides Vickhand Miah's son Habibur Rahman (defen­dant No. 2).<br/>2. After having come to know of the said <em>Kabala </em>the plaintiffs brought the suit, Title Suit No. 6 of 1985 in the Court of Munsif, Belabo for a declaration that the said <em>Kabala </em>was void and not binding upon them. They alleged that Abdul Barek did never execute the said <em>Kabala </em>and that the defendants collusively created the same after the death of Abdul Barek on false impersonation after about four months of his death.<br/><br/>3. The defendants contested the suit by fil­ing a joint written statement. Briefly put, their case was that Abdul Barek had no issue. Defendant No. 1 used to look after his property. Before his death Abdul Barek proposed to sell the suit land for his medical treatment. On receiving Tk. 500/- as consideration the impugned <em>Kabala </em>was executed on 14 October 1983. After two days of the execution of the sale deed Abdul Barek fell seriously ill and died. Subsequently the <em>Kabala </em>was registered by the heirs and legal representatives of Abdul Barek on 12 February, 1984 under the provi­sions of the Registration Act. Abdul Barek never executed any <em>heba-bil-ewaz </em>in favour of the plaintiffs.<br/><br/>4. On consideration of the evidence the learned Munsif found the deed of <em>heba-bil-ewaj </em>to be genuine one. He then noticed utter dis­crepancy of evidence regarding the time, place and manner of execution of the disputed kabala and also the facts that the defendants refrained from getting the kabala registered till nearly 4 months of the alleged execution of the deed at least through commission when Abdul Barek was critically ill. The learned Munsif therefore found he circumstances of the execution of the disputed <em>Kabala </em>as extremely dubious. He fur­ther found that the <em>Kabala </em>after the death of Abdul Barek was presented by Abdul Motaleb, one of the recipients of the impugned Kabala who was not an heir to Abdul Barek on account of his mother being alive and that the deceased Abdul Barek left behind several heirs who, far from presenting the kabala in question for reg­istration, were not been notified. The learned Munsif therefore came to the conclusion that the circumstances of the case indicated that the presentation of the kabala for registration was <em>mala fide </em>and therefore void. In the result the suit was decreed and the impugned kabala declared as void and not binding on the plain­tiffs.<br/><br/>5. Being aggrieved the contesting defen­dants preferred Title Appeal No. 14 of 1987. The appellate court while reversing the decree of the trial court did not even advert to the aforesaid reasoning of the trial court; nor did it discuss any evidence or reverse the material findings of the said court. Obviously the judgment of the appellate court was not in accor­dance with order XLI, Rule 31 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/><br/>6. In revision, Civil Revision No. 268 of 1989, preferred by the plaintiffs the High Court Division after considering a certificate, as to Abdul Barek's date of death, not marked as an exhibit though held that Abdul Barek died on 24 October, 1983 which was sufficient to estab­lish that the defendants brought their kabala into existence in a clandestine manner on false impersonation. Accordingly the said court set aside the judgment and decree of the appellate court and restored those of the trial court.<br/><br/>7. The defendants obtained leave from this Court on the following submissions: <br/>"The petitioners now contend that the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division did not consider that the defendant's document was executed earlier than that of the plaintiff and that it was registered at the instance of heirs and legal representatives of the executants under the provisions of the Registration Act and certificate of death of the executants has no bearing in this case." <br/><br/>8.  The contention of the learned Counsel for the appellants does not appear to be of any substance. The trial court's finding that the dis­puted <em>Kabala </em>was not a genuine one had not been reversed by any of the courts below and therefore the consideration which of the two documents the <em>heba-bil-ewaj </em>in favour of the plaintiffs or the <em>Kabala </em>in favour of the defen­dants was earlier in point of time is out of place. Again as already stated the trial court found that the disputed <em>Kabala </em>was not presented for reg­istration by any of the heirs of deceased Abdul Barek and the said findings was not reversed by the appellate court. Therefore the question of consideration of this aspect of the case over again does not arise. The certificate of death of Abdul Barek, the alleged executant, relied upon by the High Court Division has no bearing in this case on its facts and circumstances and that does not affect the substantial decision of the High Court Division.<br/><br/>Accordingly this appeal is dismissed with costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
