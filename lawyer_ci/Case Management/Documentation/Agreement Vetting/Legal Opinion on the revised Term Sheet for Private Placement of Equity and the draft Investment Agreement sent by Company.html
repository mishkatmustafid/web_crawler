<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p><strong>Re:      Legal Opinion on the revised Term Sheet for Private Placement of Equity and the draft Investment Agreement sent by Company 2. </strong></p>
<p>We refer to your letter dated September 13, 2007 and our opinion dated September 05, 2007 on the above subject.</p>
<p>We have perused the Revised Term Sheet (“Revised Term Sheet”) for private placement of equity sent by Company 2, managed by Company 2(“Company 2”) to be accepted by Company 1 and the Draft Investment Agreement. Our comments on the Revised Term Sheet and the Investment Agreement are given below:</p>

However it is a commercial decision. If “X” decides that the Nominee Director should not have the casting vote in this situation, then the words “which shall include the approval of the Fund’s Nominee Director” should be deleted from Clause 2.4.</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="129">Clause 2.7 and 2.8</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="483">These clauses have not been revised/rectified in the Revised Term Sheet. As such, our previous opinion regarding Clause 2.7 and 2.8 given by our letter dated September 05, 2007 still applies to these Clauses.According to clause 2.7, “X” shall stop Placement after a period of 30 days from the disbursement of investment by Company 2. It is a commercial decision as to whether “X” should accept these two clauses or not.
<p>Any attempts by “X” to raise new investment by issuing shares after the said 30 days has to comply with two conditions contained therein.</p>
<p>With regard to the requirement that the shares are to be sold at a value above Tk.25.00:</p>
<ul>
<li>This may subject to approval from the SEC hence it will be to the extend permissible by law;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The value of the Company is not at a standstill and hence how long does Company 2 intends to place this restriction?</li>
</ul>
<p>With regard to issue of shares at no cost to Company 2 in case shares are sold at a price lower than Tk.25.00:</p>
<p>This is a public company and Company 2 shall be shareholders holding ordinary shares having the same rights, benefits and privileges as other ordinary shareholders. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A company does not have right to issue shares as fully paid-up shares at no cost except issue of bonus shares</span>. If bonus shares are to be issued to Company 2, the same shall have to be issued to other shareholders under the same terms and conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Moreover</strong>, issue of shares at no cost is in fact issue of shares at 100% discount. According to Section 153 of the Companies Act 1994, a company may issue, at a discount shares, in the company of a class already issued :</p>
<p>“Provided that –</p>
<p>(a) the issued of the shares at a discount <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must be authorised by resolution passed  in  general meeting of the company</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must be sanctioned by the Court</span>;</p>
<p>(b) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the resolution must specify the maximum rate of discount, not exceeding ten  percent in any case</span>,  at which  shares are to be issued;</p>
<p>(c) not less than one year must at the date of issued have clasped since the date on which the company was entitled to commence business;</p>
<p>(d) the  shares to be issued at a discount must be issued within six months after the date on which the issue is sanctioned by the Court or within such extended time as the Court may allow.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to Section 153 of the Companies Act, the maximum discount allowed at the time of issuance of shares is 10% of the par/nominal value. Even then the discount <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must be authorised by resolution passed  in  general meeting of “X”</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must be sanctioned by the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bangladesh</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, allotment of shares is in effect an agreement/contract between the Company and the shareholder. If shares are issued at no cost then there is in fact no consideration for the contract. Therefore there is a possibility that such allotment will be of no legal validity as one of the fundamental ingredient of contract, i.e. consideration will be missing.</p>
<p>In light of the above provisions of law,  it is not possible for “X” to issue shares at no cost. “X” may issue shares at the maximum discount rate of 10% of the nominal/par value i.e. 9 taka per share.</p></td>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our comments on the Investment Agreement:</span></strong></p>
<p>The Investment Agreement is in fact a share subscription agreement. Generally share subscription agreement is executed between the company and the prospective shareholder only. However, in the Investment Agreement, apart from Company 2 and “X”, 4 shareholders of “X” have also been made party to the agreement and various obligations and conditions have been imposed on the 4 shareholders of “X”. The decision of making the shareholders of “X” party to the Investment Agreement is a commercial decision to be decided the shareholders.</p>

The Act makes no difference between a normal director and a nominee director. Therefore, the Nominee Director has to hold the qualification number of shares.
<p>According to Article 118 of Articles of Association of “X”, the qualification of a Director shall be holding of 1 lac fully paid-up shares of Tk. 10.0 each in his name other than a Director representing any institutions holding that number of fully-paid up shares.

Therefore, according to Clause 14 and 17, the parties can go to the courts of Bangladesh or refer to Arbitration; this is not legally possible. We draw your attention to Section 7 of Arbitration Act 2001, according to which, where any of the parties to an arbitration agreement files a legal proceedings to a Court against the other party, no judicial authority shall hear any legal proceedings before completion of the arbitration proceeding.Therefore, the parties should select any one forum for the resolution of dispute not both. As this is an international agreement, we are of the opinion that arbitration should be selected. Therefore we suggest you to delete Clause 14 and replace it with the following:
