<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>RE: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">LOCAL COMPANY AVAILING FOREIGN LOAN</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With reference to the above, we understand that a local manufacturing company wants to borrow foreign currency loan (USD) from an International Bank in Europe at an interest rate of LIBOR + 3% p.a. with a repayment period of 7 years. The loan amount will be to acquire existing/ new projects, for repayment of loans, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our legal opinion will only confine to the legal aspects of such transaction between the foreign lending institution and the local borrower.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The two governmental institutions in which we are concerned with in relation to foreign currency loan will be the Board of Investment and Bangladesh Bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Board of Investment (BOI) is established for the purpose of promoting investment within the country and is somewhat a regulatory body which deals with the affairs of the private industries formulating policies from time to time and giving them assistance and guidance. The Company in question being a local manufacturing concern must be registered with BOI to avail such assistance. Approval from BOI is  required of the terms and conditions of foreign private loan agreements. However BOI has set certain prescribed criteria, if met, their approval will not be necessary and mere registration of the foreign loan agreement will suffice. Approval is not required if:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a)   the effective rate of interest does not exceed LIBOR+4% (effective rate of interest is the sum of the stated annual rate of interest and the annualised fees such as commitment fee, syndication fee, front end fee, project appraisal fee, etc.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b)   repayment period should not be less than 7 years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A &amp; Associates                                              Continuation Sheet</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Registration of the foreign loan agreement merely requires that a copy of the foreign loan agreement duly executed be provided to BOI for automatic registration along with prescribed forms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If the above criteria are met, approval from Bangladesh Bank is also exempted. There will be no requirement of approval of the Bangladesh Bank/BOI for the transfer and the repatriation of the loan amount as well as the transfer of all other payments to be made by the borrower under the loan agreement. A general sanction for such remittance is also given in the Foreign Private Investment (Promotion and Protection) Act, 1980.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All governmental consents and approvals are to be obtained by the borrower prior to disbursement of loan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to entering into the loan agreement the legal documentation involved will be looking at the corporate authority under the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the borrower to see the extent of its objects, whether it covers the acts and businesses in which the Company proposes to be involved in. The authorised capital of the borrower must also be adequate to absorb any new project proposed to be undertaken/acquired by the borrower. A thorough investigation has to be conducted with regard to the current status of the assets of the Company, both movable and immovable (whether they are already encumbered as security for existing loans/liabilities) and the availability of other securities besides those of the Company to cover the whole liabilities of the borrower under the loan. In certain circumstances if the Company is entering into new projects, the lender has to be sure that the borrower has to have the technical know how to embark into the new project or has made arrangements for acquiring such technical know how.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the purpose of credit monitoring, the Bank may also require that it has a nominee Director in the Board and the quorum for Board meetings shall only be fully and properly constituted with the attendance of the Bank’s nominee Director or in case of resolutions by circulation if provided for in the Articles of Association of the borrower, the consent of the Bank’s nominee Director for such resolution is required for the same to be valid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It may be mentioned here that inspite of the completeness and effectiveness of all legal documentation to safeguard the interest of the Bank, the Bank should ascertain the creditworthiness of the borrower and its track record to its full satisfaction before entering into any agreement because realisation of defaulted dues is a protracted process.</p>
