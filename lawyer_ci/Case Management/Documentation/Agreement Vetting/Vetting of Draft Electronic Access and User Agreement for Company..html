<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear Sir</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Re:      Vetting of Draft Electronic Access and User Agreement for “W”. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We refer to your letter No. HO:TIB:2006:26277 dated September 04, 2006 on the above subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have perused the Draft Electronic Access and User Agreement, for use of “W” Online Platform (“System”), made between Bank 1, Bangladesh (“BANK 1”) and “W” PSC (““W””).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our comments on the Draft Electronic Access and User Agreement for “W” are as follows:</p>

<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="362">Please note that, under this clause “W” grants BANK 1 a non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable and limited license to access and use the System.Moreover, according to this Clause “W” may suspend or restrict BANK 1’s access to the System, and may modify the System and its content, without notice, in its sole discretion. Also Masreqbank may place limits on BANK 1’s ability to transact over the System or decline to enter into transactions with BANK 1 over the System. BANK 1 should consult whether or not they agree to allow “W” to have such wide powers.</td>

<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="362">Under this Clause, “W” in its sole discretion may refuse to act on any instruction and may from time to time restrict trading in certain financial instruments. This Clause effectively means that “W” may legally refuse to act on any instruction whatsoever of BANK 1. This Clause as such is prejudicial to BANK 1. Please consult whether BANK 1 wants to be bound by such a prejudicial Clause.</td>

<td valign="top" width="145">Clause 8</td>

Please confirm whether or not BANK 1 agrees to this prejudicial term.“W” also disclaims any obligation to keep the information available on or through the system up to date or free of errors or viruses or to maintain uninterrupted service or access. “W” also does not undertake to correct or to notify BANK 1 of any error or changes in the information displayed on the System. “W” also has no obligations to maintain particular hours of operation and may stop producing or updating all or any part of the system without notice. BANK 1 should confirm whether they want to be bound by these terms.
<p>Under this Clause the Sole Liability of “W” on any cause of action arising out of this agreement or otherwise from BANK 1’s use of the System is limited to any loss or damage arising as a direct result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of “W”. Apart from this “W” disclaims all other liability for loss of damage of any kind, including loss of profits, loss of data, direct, indirect, special or consequential loss or damage whether in contract tort (including negligence) statute or otherwise, even if “W” has been advised of the possibility of loss.
