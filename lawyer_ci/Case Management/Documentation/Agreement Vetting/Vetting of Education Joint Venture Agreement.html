<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We refer to your fax dated ………….on the above subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pursuant to your request, we have examined the draft Education Joint Venture Agreement (the “Agreement”) to be executed between X and Y.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our comments on the draft Agreement  are as follows:</p>

<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="303">The Clause provides that an amount of US$ 22,000 is payable as Development Fee at the time of signing the Agreement. From the Clause, it appears that the amount is payable in lump sum. We therefore suggest that in line 1, the words “An amount” be replaced with “A lump sum amount”.</td>

<td valign="top" width="198">Clause 5.3.5</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="303">For the sake of convenience, we suggest that the first sentence of the Clause be replaced as follows:“The Management Committee shall normally meet at least twice in a calendar year and if mutually agreed between the parties, one of the meetings may be held in India at New Delhi.”Please note that Y would have to bear the travelling and boarding expenses of the India based Members.</td>

<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="303">Under this Clause, either party may terminate the Agreement without assigning any reason, which in our opinion may be prejudicial to the interests of Y since a huge amount of investment is involved. For protection of Y’s interests, we suggest that the Clause be re-phrased as follows:“This Agreement is not terminable by either party before expiry of the term as mentioned in Clause 6.1, unless there is a material breach on the part of either party in</td>
