But COMPANY 1 has retained the right to appoint other representatives in the Territory to offer the Money Transfer Service, other Company 1 service or both.These Clauses are in restraint of trade.

As the obligations under the Agreement shall be performed in Bangladesh and the Contract Act of Bangladesh shall apply.  Clauses 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3 being void according to Bangladeshi Law, we suggest the deletion of these Clauses from the Agreement.</td>
