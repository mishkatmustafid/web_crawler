<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Re:      Vetting of </strong><strong>Memorandum of Understanding</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>We </strong> have perused the  draft MOU to be executed between Y and XL. The MOU appears to be mere understanding with no intention of the parties to formalise their understanding in legal terms in the near future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This legally unenforceable document will run for 5(five) years binding neither parties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The subject matter of this MOU is no merely to assist or transfer technology but also to set up an aerosol production plant, with the assistance of Y in providing layout plans, equipment, gas etc., the effect of such deliverables which  will have a long term and permanent effect on the plant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The draft MOU does not afford any legal protection to XL at all. The terms and conditions therein are not legally binding or enforceable against Y or XL. In simple terms, if Y supplies XL erroneous layout drawings and as a result from such erroneous drawings XL’s installation collapses and XL suffers loss, there can be no claim against Y or if the equipment to be provided by Y is  not fit for  its purpose and thereby XL cannot go for production or achieve the determined production capacity, Y cannot be held liable, nor do they have any obligations to repair or replace the defective equipment or reimburse XL, nor can XL claim for damages.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are not sure what the cost is involved here or what form of consideration is involved in this transaction. However, this sort of transaction requires more than a  mere MOU to tie each party to perform its obligations. Even if the supply of the equipment is for a cost or value lesser than the equipment itself, or if the equipment is on a “ as is where is basis”, there should be some legally contracted parameters. XL will be investing  and  its investment will be  based on the deliverables. If the deliverables  are not fit of its purpose, XL’s  investment  will be at risk.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The draft MOU in its present from contains merely a list of actions each party may do for the other without any obligations to do so or legal implications and hence we have no comments on the draft.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have any further queries, please revert back to us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanking you. SPL</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we understand, XLimited contemplates to set-up a LPG unit for production of Aerosol and in pursuant to that has approached COMPANY 1  (Y) to provide technical assistance.  Y agreed  on the same and  sent the draft  Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to be executed by and between both the parties.  We have perused the draft MOU and our opinion is as follows:</p>
