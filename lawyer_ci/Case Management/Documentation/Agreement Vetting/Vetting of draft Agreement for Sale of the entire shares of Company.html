<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear Sir</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Re:      Vetting of draft Agreement for </strong><strong>Sale</strong><strong> of the entire shares of Company 2. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We refer to your letter no. PLC/2006/3730 dated October 30, 2006 on the above subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have perused the draft Agreement for Sale of the entire shares of Company 2 (“the Company”) to be executed between Company 1 and Mr. B, who is representing all the shareholders of the Company (“the Vendor”).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Please note that the Agreement is not a standard Share Sale Agreement, which contemplates and documents the whole implementation of the transactions leading to the transfer, from pre-closing conditions to be fulfilled prior to transfer and post closing conditions to be fulfilled after transfer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our opinion is restricted to the terms and conditions set forth in the draft provided:</p>

<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="477">Please note though Mr. B represents all the shareholders, he is merely a constituted attorney ALL the shareholders MUST be made parties to the agreement (named) Mr. B can execute the agreement for and on their behalf if so provided in the Power of Attorney (POA). The POA should be annexed to the Agreement.Also please check whether the power of attorney has been executed properly and also check whether that power of attorney has been registered.</td>

<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="477">In the Particulars of the Vendor, M/S Company 2. has been defined as “the Co.” but this term has not been used throughout the agreement – sometimes the term “Co.” has been used, at other times “Company” has been used. As such we suggest you to define M/S Company 2. as “the Company” and use this term through the Agreement uniformly.Please change the word “Vendor” to “Vendors” and change the reference throughout the agreement.</td>

<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="477">It is not clear if the Agreement is the Sale Deed. Either refer to the Agreement as “this Agreement” or define the agreement as a “Sale Deed” and use the reference throughout the Agreement.It is not the sale of property where the title deeds are handed over upon execution of a Deed of Sale.
<p>It is a private company, each shareholder should offer the other to purchase his/her shares, failing which the shares will be sold to the Purchaser – this will required to be documented. The Board of the Company must approve of the transfer and the change of management.</p>
<p>The Purchaser should compile a list of documents to be handed over upon closing of the transaction and what other documents to be handed over post closing.</p>
<p>Clause 7 is not an exhaustive list, letter of renouncement, the minutes and resolution for transfer and change of manage, the original Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company with the original Incorporation Certificate, the Share Certificate of the DSE, the share certificate book, Register of Members, Transfer Book and other corporate books, certification from the banker of the Company that no dues is owed and no charges have been made on the assets of the Company should be added on.</p></td>
