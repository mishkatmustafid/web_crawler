<p style="text-align: justify;">We have perused the draft deed of agreement for establishment of Remittance Arrangement (“the Agreement”) between Bank 1 (“BANK 1”) and Company 1. (“Euro-Bangla”). Our comments on the draft agreement are given below:</p>

<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="467">The term “the Bank” has been used in several places in the agreement. However, as Jamuna Bank Ltd has been defined as “BANK 1”, we suggest you to delete all references to “the Bank” and replace those with “BANK 1”.</td>

<td valign="top" width="134">Clauses 1 and 2</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="467">Clauses 1 and 2 refer to ‘Annexure A’ that contains the list of Branches of BANK 1. But upon perusal of the Agreement we could not find any such annexure. At the time of execution of the agreement, please ensure that the annexure is attached with the agreement.</td>
