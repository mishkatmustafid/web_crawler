<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Re:      Vetting of draft documents, A/c. Company 1.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We refer to your letter on the captioned subject. We have perused the contents of your letter and other draft documents attached therewith on account of Pran Beverage Limited (the Borrower). Our opinion on the same are drawn below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deed of Hypothecation on Stock (Movables) and Draft of Deed of Hypothecation on book debts (Receivables):</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon perusal of the draft of Deed of Hypothecation on Stock (Movable) and Deed of Hypothecation on Book Debts (Receivables) it appears that hypothecation on stocks and book debts will be created favouring both BANK 1 and BANK 2.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this regard, please note that charge has been already created on the fixed and floating assets of the Borrower by way of Hypothecation in favour of BANK 2 by executing Letter of Hypothecation by way of Floating Charge dated 30<sup>th</sup> December 2004 and Letter of Hypothecation by way of fixed charge dated 01<sup>st</sup> February 2006. The above-mentioned documents have been duly filed with RJSC and thus First charge has been created in favour of BANK 2.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now if the Borrower wants to create first charge in favour of both the banks in a single instrument, the charge already created in favour of BANK 2 shall have to be vacated first which is a cost-extensive and cumbersome procedure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hence, it will be worthwhile to create new charge in favour of BANK 1 only. However, in the Lenders Pari Passu Security Agreement, the lenders shall agree to share the security interests of the Borrower on pari passu basis notwithstanding the date of execution of the securities by the respective lenders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In view of the above, we suggest to delete all references of BANK 2 in the Deed of Hypothecation on Stock (Movables) and of Deed of Hypothecation on book debts (Receivables) and revise the drafts to create charge in favour of BANK 1 only.</p>
