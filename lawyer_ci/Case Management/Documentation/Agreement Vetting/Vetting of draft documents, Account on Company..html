<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Re:      Vetting of draft documents, A/c.Company 1.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We refer to your letter on the captioned subject. We have perused the contents of your letter and other draft documents attached therewith on account of Pran Beverage Limited (the Borrower). Our opinion on the same is drawn below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deed of Hypothecation on Stock (Movables) and Draft of Deed of Hypothecation on book debts (Receivables):</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon perusal of the draft of Deed of Hypothecation on Stock (Movable) and Deed of Hypothecation on Book Debts (Receivables) it appears that hypothecation on stocks and book debts will be created favouring both COMPANY 1 and BANK 1.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this regard, please note that charge has been already created on the fixed and floating assets of the Borrower by way of Hypothecation in favour of BANK 1 by executing Letter of Hypothecation by way of Floating Charge dated 30<sup>th</sup> December 2004 and Letter of Hypothecation by way of fixed charge dated 01<sup>st</sup> February 2006. The above-mentioned documents have been duly filed with RJSC and thus prior charges have already been created in favour of BANK 1.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now if the Borrower wants to create first charge in favour of both the banks in a single instrument, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the charges already created in favour of BANK 1 shall have to be vacated first which is a cost-extensive and cumbersome procedure</span>. Registration fee based on the amount of loans granted to BANK 1 will have to be paid again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hence, it will be worthwhile to create new charge only in favour of COMPANY 1 only. However, in the Lenders Pari Passu Security Agreement, the lenders will agree to share the security interests of the Borrower on pari passu basis notwithstanding the date of execution of the securities by the respective lenders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In view of the above, we suggest to delete all references of BANK 1 in the Deed of Hypothecation on Stock (Movables) and of Deed of Hypothecation on book debts (Receivables) and revise the drafts to create charge in favour of COMPANY 1 only. The deed should not only be confined to a charge of a maximum limit of loan granted by COMPANY 1 but must provided details of the loan agreement or sanction letter between the Borrower and COMPANY 1 which grants the loan. Once the debt against that sanction is repaid or discharge, all charges securing that loan will also be discharged.</p>
