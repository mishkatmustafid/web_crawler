<td valign="top" width="149">Opinion</td>
<td valign="top" width="25">:</td>
<td valign="top" width="390">Upon perusal of the documents/papers we are of the opinion that the present owner Mr. D Son of Mr. X of Vill: Dhitpur, Post Office-Sibgang, Police Station: Valuka, District: Mymensingh has acquired prima facie ownership over the land measuring 5 (five) katha 15 (fifteen) chattak Physical possession of the present owners over the said land should be ascertained and document/paper referred in Clause 13 above should be obtained.
<p>From Irrevocable General Power of Attorney No. 23106 date 15.10.2006 it appears that Mr. D (Landowner) has appointed NAVANA REAL ESTATE LTD, represented by its Managing Director Mr. Sajedul Islam of House No. 35, Road No. 9A, (New), Dhanmondi R/A, Dhaka (the DEVELOPER) as his constituted attorney empowering its to develop the land measuring 5 (five) katha 15 (fifteen) chattak by way of constructing 6(six) storied residential building and sell the same to intending purchasers as per provisions of the Agreement executed earlier between Landowners and developers.</p>
<p><strong>The acceptance letter from the RAJUK to accept the Power of Attorney No. 23106 date 15.10.2006 should be obtained</strong></p>
<p>From the said Power of Attorney it also appears that the developers will develop the said land, construct a six storied building with 10 (ten) Apartments on first to fifth floor and 10 (ten) car parking spaces on the ground floor, enter into agreements with prospective purchasers, sale 50% of the said land, 50% of the Apartments &amp; 50% Car Parking Spaces to prospective purchasers with undivided and undemarcated proportionate land.</p>
<p>However, upon obtaining registered Agreement for Sale executed by and between the borrower Md. Ali Akber and Md. Ali Akram and Landowner through his constituted attorney-Developer, then the Bank may finance to the borrower Md. Ali Akber and Md. Ali Akram on the basis of a Tripartite Agreement stipulating inter alia that within a certain period after registration of the apartment in the name of Md. Ali Akber and Md. Ali Akram, they will create mortgage over the same in favour of the Bank.</p>
