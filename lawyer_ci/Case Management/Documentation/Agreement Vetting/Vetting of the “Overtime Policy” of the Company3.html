<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>RE:      VETTING OF THE “OVERTIME POLICY” OF THE COMPANY</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We refer to your letter no. 0707/02 dated July 18, 2007 on the above subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have perused the draft copy of the “Overtime Policy” of the Integrated Services Limited (Company 1).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our comments on the draft overtime policy” are as follows:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td valign="top" width="120">Heading of the policy “Option 1 and Option 2”</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="398">Please delete the words “options -I &amp; II”. Option means alternative. The contents under those heading does not mean any alternative policy. As such, please write Clause/ Article instead of Option. Therefore, you may write either Article 1 &amp; Article 2 or Clause 1 &amp; Clause 2.</td>

<td valign="top" width="120">Option-I (a)</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="398">Section 108 (1) of the Labour Law of Bangladesh, 2006 (“the Act”) provides that in any establishment if any worker, in any day or week, works extra time <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in addition to the period of time specified under the Act</span>, he shall be paid double to his basic pay for such overtime.According to Section 100 of the Act, no adult worker shall work or be made to work for more than 8 hour daily in any establishment. Provided that subject to Section 108 of the Act, a worker may work up to 10 hours in an establishment.According to Section 101 of the Act, no worker shall be compellable to work more than 8 hour daily unless he has been given one 1 hour break or two half an hour breaks.
<p>According to Section 103 of the Act, a worker working in a commercial/industrial establishment is entitled to one and a half days weekly holiday.</p>
<p>Therefore, overtime policy should comply with the above stated provisions. As such please delete option-1 (a) and replace it as follows:</p>
<p>Clause I (a), “The overtime work and payment thereof shall be allowed to non-officer employees provided one of following conditions are satisfied:</p>
<p>a) if the non-officer employees have worked 8 (eight) hours on any weekday (i.e. Sunday to Wednesday and Saturday), then any work done after the said 8 (eight) hours shall be calculated as overtime; or</p>
<p>b) if the non-officer employees have worked after 2.00 pm on any Thursday, then any work done after 2.00 pm on that day shall be calculated as overtime</p>
<p>c)  if the non-officer employees have worked on the weekly holiday, then any work done on that day shall be calculated as overtime.”</p></td>
