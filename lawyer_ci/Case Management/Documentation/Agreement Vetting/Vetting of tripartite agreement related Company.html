<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear Sir</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Re:      Vetting of tripartite agreement; A/C: Company 1.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We refer to your letter no. KB/CR/3382/06 dated October 01, 2006 on the above subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have perused the draft tripartite agreement to be executed between Company 1 (“Company”), a construction company (“Client”) and Bank 1 (“Bank”). Our opinion on the same is given below.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="79"><strong>Clause</strong></td>
<td valign="top" width="499"><strong>Observations:</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="79">2.2</td>
<td valign="top" width="499">Please replace this Clause with Clauses 5.1 and 5.2. of the draft agreement
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Obligations of Bank only arises from the authorisation by Client, the present Clause 2.2 is not a reflection of the authorisation process.</em></strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="79">2.3</td>
<td valign="top" width="499">Please replace as follows:
<p style="text-align: justify;">(i) The Client may, from time to time, request the Company to supply the required quantity of cement by submitting to the Company duly completed, signed and sealed Purchase Request Form and Credit Request Authorisation by fax; and</p>
<p>(ii)  The Client shall within three (3) Working Days from the date of the Credit Request Authorisation, provide the original hard copy of the same to the Bank.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="79">2.5</td>
<td valign="top" width="499">Please replace as follows:
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Upon receiving the fax copy of the Credit Request Authorisation and covering letter pursuant to Clause 2.4, the Bank shall, upon satisfactory verification of the signatures and details therein; credit the amount stated in the Credit Request Authorisation in full to the Account and shall send a Confirmation Statement to the Company confirming payment to the Account.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Withholding taxes is a issue between Seller and Buyer, the Bank will take direct authorisation from the Buyer as to payment and will make payment to Seller of the amount instructed by the Buyer – the Bank will take no obligations with regard to withholding taxes between Seller and Buyer.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="79">2.7</td>
<td valign="top" width="499">Please replace as follows:
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Bank shall not be obligated to make any payment under this Agreement if the Facility is exhausted or is insufficient to make full payment against any Credit Request Authorisation and shall in writing inform the Company and the Client of such discrepancy.”</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="79">3.3</td>
<td valign="top" width="499">Please add as follows:
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Provided that the termination of this Agreement shall not under any circumstance relieve the Client from its payment obligations under the Sanction Letter.”</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="79">4.3</td>
<td valign="top" width="499">Please replace as follows:
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Except for the obligations of the Company herein, the Company shall have no other financial or other liability towards the Bank under this Agreement.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If the Company has no contractual obligations towards the Bank then where are the premises of a contractual relationship between the Company and the Bank, there is also no consideration and therefore no contract between the Company and the Bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under Section 28 of the Contract Act, no party can debar the other party from seeking relief under an agreement. Such clause is void and unlawful.</p>

<td valign="top" width="79">7.3</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="499">This clause is to be deleted; it is covered in Clause 7.2. Otherwise the same indemnification must be given to the Bank.</td>
