As the cash credit (hypothecation) facilities has been renewed and enhanced, the borrower should now execute a deed of further charge and memorandum of deposit of title deeds in favour of your bank. Draft deeds of further charge, memorandum of deposit of title deeds are enclosed with this letter.</p>
<p>The file with all photocopy documents is returned to you.</p>
