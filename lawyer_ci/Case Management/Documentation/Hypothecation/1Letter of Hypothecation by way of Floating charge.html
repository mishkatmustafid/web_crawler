The Lenders will apply the proceeds of any such disposal in or towards the discharge of the Secured Liabilities only when due and payable and in such order as the Lenders may from time to time conclusively determine. If such proceeds are insufficient for such purpose, the Borrower hereby undertakes immediately to make good such deficiency.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">(11)   the authorized person(s) of the Lenders may at any time or times with reasonable notice to the Borrower enter any premises where the Hypothecated Property or any of them may be and inspect the same.</p>
