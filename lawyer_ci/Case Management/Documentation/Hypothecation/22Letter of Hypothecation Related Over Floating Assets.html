<p style="text-align: justify;">Sirs,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In consideration for the Bank granting us working capital facilities of an aggregate amount of Tk. 22,60,00,000.00 (Taka twenty two crore sixty lac) only (the “Loan”) on the terms and conditions stipulated in the Loan Agreement dated ____________ (the “Loan Agreement”) between the Bank and ourselves; we</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">(hereinafter referred to as the ‘Borrower’)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">do hereby hypothecate to the Bank by way of a first priority floating charge with full title guarantee of all the current and floating assets of the Borrower including but not limited to stocks, book debts, receivables, both present and future, in which  the Borrower may have an interest (hereinafter called the “Hypothecated Property”) to secure as a continuing security until full and final repayment of the Loan on the terms and conditions in the Loan Agreement and all reasonable legal and other costs, charges and expenses incidental to this security and to the enforcement thereof (hereinafter called the “Secured Liabilities”) and this security shall be kept in deposit with the Bank and the same may be enforceable by the Bank in an event of default by the Borrower under the Loan Agreement.</p>

The Bank will apply the proceeds of any such disposal in or towards the discharge of the Secured Liabilities only when due and payable and in such order as the Bank may from time to time conclusively determine. If such proceeds are insufficient for such purpose, the Borrower hereby undertakes immediately to make good such deficiency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Borrower shall, if and whenever properly and legally required by the Bank:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(a)        execute, sign and deliver all transfers, delivery orders and other documents which the Bank may from time to time require for perfecting title to all or any part of the Hypothecated Property, or for vesting or enabling it/them to vest any of the Hypothecated Property in, or for facilitating delivery of the same to, the Bank or their nominees; and</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(b)               do all such other acts and things as may be reasonably necessary or expedient for effecting, or in connection with, any sale or other disposition which the Bank may make in respect of all or any of the Hypothecated Property, including the execution of any necessary documents/instruments in connection thereof.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Borrower further agrees and undertakes as follows:-</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(1)     that the Hypothecated Property is the Borrower’s exclusive and absolute property in which no one else has any material claim, concern, right or interest of whatever nature, as far as possible the Borrower shall ensure the same shall continue to be free from any defect of title;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(2)     that the Hypothecated Property is free from encumbrances and charges and during the continuance of this security the Borrower shall not create any charge or encumbrance over or allow any material lien to arise or affect the Hypothecated Property;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(3)     the Borrower has legal right, full power and absolute authority to so hypothecate the Hypothecated Property and, the Borrower has not concealed any material fact  from the Bank;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(4)     the Borrower has not prior to the date of these presents done, made, committed, caused or knowingly suffered to be done any act, deed or matter whereby or by reasons of which the right to so hypothecate has been or may be impaired;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(5)     the Borrower shall during the continuance of this security pay all rates, taxes, cesses, assessments and such other impositions and/or liabilities of whatsoever nature levied by the tax and/or other governmental agencies/authorities as are or may be payable in respect of the Hypothecated Property or any part thereof and shall keep the Bank fully indemnified at all times against any and all actions, proceedings, claims, demands, damages, penalties, costs, charges and expenses arising therefrom;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(6)     the Borrower shall keep and hold the Bank secured, harmless and indemnified against all losses and damages suffered or sustained by the Bank as a result of any defect in the Borrower’s title or any claim or demand preferred by anyone with respect to the Hypothecated Property or any part thereof arising from such a defect in title;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(7)     the Borrower shall keep the Hypothecated Property free from being restrained for rent, rates or taxes, or taken or attached under any execution;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(8)     the Borrower shall maintain, preserve and protect the Hypothecated Property, as the case may be, and shall keep the same in good repair and proper condition and cause to be made all normal repairs, renovations, replacements and improvements thereto and shall not allow the same to deteriorate (except normal wear and tear) in value or otherwise until the Loans has been repaid on the terms and conditions in the Loan Agreement;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(9)          the Borrower shall insure and keep insured at its own expense that part of the Hypothecated Property which is insurable against loss or damage by fire, storm, lightning, explosion, riot, civil commotion, malicious damage, impact, flood, burst pipes, landsliding, aircraft and other aerial devices or articles dropped therefrom (other than war risk), third party and public liability, such insurance to be effected with the interest of the Bank noted on the policies and with the policies duly assigned to the Bank;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Bank on demand against all losses, actions, claims, expenses, demands and liabilities of whatever nature now or hereafter incurred or made against the Bank for anything done or omitted to be done in the exercise or purported exercise of powers herein contained or occasioned by any breach by the Borrower of any of the Borrower’s obligations hereunder.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Borrower hereby agrees that if an Event of Default occurs, upon the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement, the Bank may combine or consolidate all or any of its then existing accounts wherever situate, whether such accounts are current, deposit, loan or of any other nature whatsoever, whether they are subject to notice or not and whether they are denominated in Taka or in any other currency, and set off or transfer any sums standing to the credit of any one or more such accounts in or toward satisfaction of the Secured Liabilities which, to the extent not then payable.</p>
