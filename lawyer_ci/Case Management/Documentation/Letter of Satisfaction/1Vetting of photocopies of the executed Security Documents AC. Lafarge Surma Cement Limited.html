<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RE:     Vetting of photocopies of the executed Security Documents A/C. Lafarge Surma Cement Limited</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We refer to your letter dated September 19, 2007 in connection to the captioned subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have perused the contents of your letter and other papers/documents attached therewith. Our comments on the same are given below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The following Documents of Lafarge Surma Cement Limited are required under the Banking Facility Letter dated February 01, 2007 and its subsequent addendums dated February 01, 2007 and March 12, 2007 (“Facility Letters”):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1.                  <strong>Demand Promissory Note and Letter of Continuation for BDT 2,300,000,000 from Company 1</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, please note that, according to the Banking Facility Letter dated February 01, 2007, Demand Promissory Note and Letter of Continuation for BDT 2,150,000,000 is one of the securities against the facility and according to the addendum dated March 12, 2007, Demand Promissory Note and Letter of Continuation for BDT 2,300,000,000 is supposed to be an additional security to the existing ones. Please check whether the Demand Promissory Note and Letter of Continuation for BDT 2,300,000,000 is an additional security or whether it is supposed to replace the previous ones for BDT 2,150,000,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2.  <strong>Demand Promissory Note and Letter of Continuation for BDT 500,000,000 from Company 2(dated 27.11.2005):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order.</p>
