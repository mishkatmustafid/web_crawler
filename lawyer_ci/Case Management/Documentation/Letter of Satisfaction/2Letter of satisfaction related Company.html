<p style="text-align: justify;">We refer to the above subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have perused the documents referred to us. It appears from the security documents that the same have been executed basing upon a sanction letter dated 31.08.2003. But we have not been provided with the sanction letter dated 31.08.2003. We have been provided with a sanction letter dated 31.08.2004 from which it appears that Bank has granted fresh facilities of Tk. 14.00 million. Please confirm whether fresh facilities were granted pursuant to the sanction letter dated 31.08.2004 or the Bank renewed the facilities granted earlier. If it is a renewal, then it should be specifically mentioned in the sanction letter dated 31.08.2004 that the facilities granted earlier have been renewed.</p>
