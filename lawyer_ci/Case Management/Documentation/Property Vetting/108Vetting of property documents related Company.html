<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon perusal of C.S. Khatian No.40, it appears that land measuring 87 decimal under Dag No. 302 along with other lands in several Dags were recorded in the name of Karim Baksh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Karim Baksh sold the land to Paia Gazi vide Deed of Sale No. 2299 dated 29.02.1928. After the death of Paia Gazi his son Peskar Ali became owner of the land by way of succession.

And in the R.S. operation land measuring 82 decimal under Dag No. 547 was recorded in his name as well.</p>
