<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>RE:</strong> <strong>FURTHER VETTING OF PROPERTY DOCUMENTS/PAPERS </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A/C. “W” &amp; “M”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We refer to your letter dated 20.04.2006 received by us on 24.04.2006 on the above subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have perused the following documents/papers (all photocopies) that you have referred to us and our opinion is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1.  Certified copy of Deed of Sale No. 5065 dated 27.03.2006 executed by Mr. A through their constituted attorney Home Craft Limited represented by its Managing Director Mr. B.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2.  Notarised Deed of Agreement to Use Common Facilities of Flat Building dated 19.03.06 executed between Mr. C, “M”, Home Craft Limited.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon perusal the said certified copy of Deed of Sale No. 5065 dated 27.03.2006 it appears that “M” purchased <strong>02 (two) Flats on the entire 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> floor measuring 10,716.74 (ten thousand seven hundred sixteen and point seven four) square feet </strong>including common proportionate car parking spaces in the ground floor common facilities of stair case, lift, and roof of the Building and 4/10<sup>th</sup> shares of undivided and undemarcated land measuring 3.34 Kathas out of undivided and undemarcated land measuring 8 (eight) Katha 05 (five) Chattak 29 (twenty nine) square feet from Mr. C through their constituted attorney Home Craft Limited represented by its Managing Director Mr. B.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From Deed of Agreement to Use Common Facilities of Flat Building dated 19.03.06 (the ‘Deed of Agreement’) it appears that Mr. C, “M”, Home Craft Limited entered into the agreement to determine the use of common facilities of the Building. According the Deed of Agreement Mrs. “M” is solely entitled to use car parking space ‘B’, lift situated at west side, roof ‘B’ of the Building specified in the attached Map thereon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the deed of sale has already been executed in favour of Mrs. Selima Bensaid in respect of the said two flats she may mortgage the flats along with undivided and undemarcated land in favour of the Bank upon obtaining permission from RAJUK.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bank should obtain the following documents:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a) Permission from RAJUK to mortgage the property in favour of the Bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b) Mutation Parcha certified from Assistant Commissioner of Land in the name of Mrs. Selima Bensaid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">c) Up to date ground rent receipt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">d)  Up to date municipal tax payment receipt, if applicable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All papers/documents referred to us are returned herewith.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanking you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yours faithfully,</p>
