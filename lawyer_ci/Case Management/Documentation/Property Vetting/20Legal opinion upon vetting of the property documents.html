<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>14. Opinion:</strong></p>

Khatian No. 190, Dag No. 3968, vide mutation case no. 14843/09-10 dated 07.12.2009. But the mutation DCR is not shows the khatian number &amp; dag number.

<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the Bank may accept the scheduled property as security in the form of legal mortgage against the loan facility subject to obtain the wanting papers/documents as mentioned in above and collect all original copies. Moreover the Bank, before creating mortgage upon the scheduled property should verify the spot physically for ascertaining the actual and peaceful possession of<strong> X </strong>over the scheduled property and collect all original copies instead of photocopies submitted to us.</p>
