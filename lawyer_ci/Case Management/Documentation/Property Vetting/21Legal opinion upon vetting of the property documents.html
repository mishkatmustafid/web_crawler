<p> </p>
<p><strong>14. Opinion:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In view of the above, we are of opinion that <strong>Mr. X</strong>has acquired <em>prima facie </em>title &amp; ownership over the scheduled property by way of partition deed. As such the said owner is required to produce the wanting papers mentioned in Column No. 13 above in support of his right, title &amp; ownership over the scheduled property.</p>
<p><strong><em>It is pertinent to mention that in the instant case the said landowner has submitted photocopies of certified copy of partition deed instead of original therefor. Usually in the cases of partition deed/exchange deed is executed in many copies as the number of parties are therein. But we did not find any such statement in the certified copies of partition deed as to how many copies had been executed thereto. Hence to avoid any future complexity in this regard the landowner in association with other co-owners should immediately procure the original Partition Deed being No. 5233 dated 20.08.1997 from the concerned sub- registry office so that Mr. Xcan produce at least photocopies (attested) of the said original deed. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>In light of the above, the Bank submitted a letter issued from Janata Bank, Razarbag Corporate Branch,</em></strong><strong><em> the original Deed of Amicable Partition being No. </em></strong><strong><em>5233 dated 20.08.1997 </em></strong><strong><em>was held by Hazi Abu Naser Wahid (custodian) which is now lying with Janata Bank, </em></strong><strong><em>Razarbag Corporate Branch</em></strong><strong><em> as a security for repayment of loan availed by Hazi Abu Naser Wahid (custodian) being the proprietor of M/s. Mollah Brick Manufacturer. Therefore, we advice that the </em></strong><strong><em>Bank must ask the Borrower to obtain the certified copy of </em></strong><strong><em>Deed of Amicable Partition being No. </em></strong><strong><em>5233 dated 20.08.1997 </em></strong><strong><em>from concerned sub-registry office and intimate to Bank’s end. In addition to that, an undertaking has to be given by Hazi Abu Naser Wahid (custodian) adjusts the loan of Janata Bank, </em></strong><strong><em>Razarbag Corporate Branch</em></strong><strong><em>, he has to surrender the original Deed of Amicable Partition to the Bank (UCBL).</em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, the Bank can only accept the scheduled land as security of loan by way of mortgage subject to procuring the corroborating papers and documents as mentioned in column no. 13 above and to obtain all original whereof photocopies are initially referred to us.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Bank before creation of mortgage on the scheduled land should verify the spot physically for ascertaining actual and undisputed possession of Mr. Xover the scheduled property.</p>
<p>For this opinion, we have assumed that:</p>
<ul>
<li>all documents/papers submitted to us as photocopies are complete and confirm to authentic original documents.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>all representations and statements made with regard to the documents by the parties are true and accurate.</li>
</ul>
