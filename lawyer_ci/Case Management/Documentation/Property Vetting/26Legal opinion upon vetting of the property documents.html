<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>14. Opinion:</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>In view of the above, we are of opinion that <strong>(i) A(ii)</strong> <strong>B(iii)</strong> <strong>C</strong>&amp;<strong> (iv)</strong> <strong>D</strong>have acquired <em>prima facie</em> title &amp; ownership over the scheduled property in question by way of purchase. As such the said owners are required to produce the wanting papers mentioned in Column No. 13 above in support of their right, title &amp; ownership over the scheduled land.</li>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>It is pertinent to mention that total area of land as per Title Deed is 31.40 (thirty one point four zero) decimals under the Khatian No. 8 land measuring 4.13 &amp; Khatian No. 52 land measuring 27.27 decimals, but the landowners have got mutated 31.40 decimals under the R.S. Khatian No. 8 land measuring 4.13 &amp; R.S. Khatian No. 13 land measuring 27.27 decimals </em></strong><strong><em>The Bank must seek clarification/explanation from the client of such wrong.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the Bank can only accept the scheduled property as security in the form of legal mortgage against the loan facility subject to obtain the wanting papers/documents as mentioned in above and collect all original papers/documents thereof.

<p style="text-align: justify;">For this opinion, we have assumed that:</p>
