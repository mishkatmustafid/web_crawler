<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>14. Opinion:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In view of the above, we are of opinion that<strong> Mr. Md. X</strong>has acquired <em>prima facie</em> title and ownership over the schedule-I &amp; II property in question by way of purchase. As such the said owner is required to produce the wanting papers mentioned in Column No. 13 above in support of its right, title and ownership over the scheduled property.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This opinion has been furnished on the basis of the photocopies of papers and documents, hence we advise you to provide all original papers/documents including the wanting papers so that we can extend our final opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the Bank can only accept the scheduled property as security in the form of legal mortgage against the loan facility subject to obtain the wanting papers/documents as mentioned in Column No. 13 above. Moreover the Bank, before creating mortgage upon the scheduled property should verify the spot physically for ascertaining the actual and peaceful possession of<strong> Mr. X, </strong>over the scheduled property and collect all original copies instead of photocopies submitted to us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For this opinion, we have assumed that:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>all documents/papers submitted to us as photocopies are complete and confirm to authentic original documents.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>all representations and statements made with regard to the documents by the parties are true and accurate.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This opinion is rendered only to you as our client and is solely for your benefit. No other person may rely upon it for any purpose, without our previous written consent. The file with all photocopies of papers/documents is returned herewith.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanking you.</p>
