<td valign="top" width="156">Opinion</td>
<td valign="top" width="18">:</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="390">Upon perusal of the documents/papers, we are of the opinion that Mrs. Fatema Safdar, Mr. B, Mr. C and Mrs. Jabeen Kasem (the ‘landowners’) have acquired prima facie ownership over the land in question. Bank should ascertain physical possession of them over the land and obtain documents/papers referred in Clause 13 above.From certified copy of Irrecoverable General Power of Attorney No. 3307 dated 16.06.2004 (the ‘IGPA’) it appears that Fatema Safdar, Mr. C and Mr. D appointed ABC Real Estates Limited represented by its Director Mr. Nashid Islam and in the absence of him Director Mr. Rashed Ahmed Chowdhury (the ‘Developer) as their constituted attorney empowering it <em>inter alila</em> to construct 06 (six) storied building comprising 20 apartments over the land and to sell 18 apartments out of 20 apartments and car parking spaces alongwith undivided and undemarcated proportionate land to the prospective buyers. As per the IGPA, the landowners shall get 02 (two) Apartments being Nos. A/3 and B/3 out of the said 20 (twenty) apartments. <strong>We have not been provided with any Irrevocable General Power of Attorney executed by A.Q.S. Safdar.</strong>
<p>Upon perusal of unregistered Deed of Agreement executed between the Developer and one Shahidul Islam Khan it appears that there is an another Irrevocable General Power of Attorney executed in abroad being Treasury No. 600/2004 dated 14.07.2004. <strong>But we have not been provided with the Irrevocable General Power of Attorney</strong> <strong>being Treasury No. 600/2004 dated 14.07.2004. We have also not been provided with any acceptance letter provided by Ministry of Housing and Public Works showing that it has been accepted ABC Real Estates Limited as the attorney of the landowners</strong>.</p>
<p>It appears that Mr. Md. Shahidul Islam has entered into the said Deed of Agreement with the Developer to purchase an apartment measuring 1500 square feet, being No. D-4 along with undivided and undemarcated proportionate land. Since the Deed of Agreement is not registered, Shahidul Islam did not acquire any right over the Apartment or land.</p>
<p>In such situation Bank should advise Mr. Md. Shahidul Islam to enter into a Biananama  (Agreement for Sale) with the landowners represented by the Developer/Attorney to purchase the Apartment. Upon registering the said Biananama with the concerned Sub- Registrar Office the Bank may finance Mr. Md. Shahidul Islam (the “Borrower’). Bank may do so, in the basis of a Tripartite Agreement among Bank, Borrower and the landowners represented by the Developer/ Attorney stipulating <em>inter alia</em> that within a certain period after registration of the apartment in the name of Borrower, the Borrower will create mortgage over the same in favour of the Bank upon obtaining approval from Ministry of Housing and Public Works.</p>
<p>We have provided this opinion on the basis of the documents/papers referred to us. We do not confirm the genuineness of the documents. You may verify the genuineness of submitted documents with the concerned Sub-registry office or concerned authorities.</p></td>
