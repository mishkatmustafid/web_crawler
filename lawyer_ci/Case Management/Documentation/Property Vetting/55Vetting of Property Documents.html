<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="390">Upon perusal of the documents/papers we are of the opinion that Shakawat Hossain, Md. Rassel, Dil Afroza, Jahan Afroza (the ‘landowners’) have acquired prima facie ownership over the land measuring 25.5 Katha equivalent to 4248 ajutangsha. Physical possession of the present owners over the land should be ascertained and documents/papers referred in Clause 13 above may be obtained.In case of house loan for purchasing an apartment, Bank should obtain photocopy of original title deed(s), certified copy of original title deed(s), certified copy/original copy of bia deed(s) which is/are available and all supporting papers on the basis of which we have provided our opinion.
<p>It appears that the Landowners appointed the Rangs Properties Limited as constituted attorney (Attorney/Developer) vide Irrevocable General Power of Attorney (IGPA) No. 1857 dated 21.05.2001. By virtue of the IGPA the Developerempowered<em> inter alia</em> to sell the Apartments in respect of the aforesaid property on behalf of landowner.</p>
<p>In such situation, Bank may advise Mr. Mahboob Hasan Chowdhury and Mr. Abdul Gafur to enter into an Agreement for Sale with the Landowners through Attorney/Developer clearly mentioning the time for transferring the apartment along with undivided undemarcated land by way of a Deed of Sale. If such an agreement is entered into then the same has to be presented for registration with the concerned Sub-Registry office within 1 (one) month from the date of execution.</p>
<p>Bank may finance Mr. Mahboob and Mr. Gafur (Purchasers/Borrowers) in order to purchase the Apartment on the basis of Deed of Agreement for Sale to be executed among the Bank, Borrowers and Landowners (through Attorney/Developer) stipulating inter alia that within a certain period after registration of the apartment in the name of purchaser, they will create mortgage over the same.</p>
<p>Bank should also take necessary steps to complete other security documentation formalities as the Bank’s House Loan Policy.</p>
<p>Please note that we have provided this opinion on the basis of the documents/papers referred to us. We do not confirm the genuineness of submitted documents. If the Bank is satisfied with genuineness of the documents, Bank may accept the property as security of the loan.</p></td>
