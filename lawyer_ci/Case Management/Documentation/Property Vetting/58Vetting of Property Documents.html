<td valign="top" width="149"><strong>Opinion</strong></td>
<td valign="top" width="25">:</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="384">Upon perusal of the documents/papers, we are of the opinion that the present owner Mr. A   (the ‘Landowner’) has acquired prima facie ownership over the land measuring 48.45 (forty eight point forty five) decimals. Physical possession of the Landowner over the land should be ascertained and documents/papers referred in Clause 13 above should be obtained.Mr. A   (the ‘Landowner’) entered into a Deed of Agreement in the year 2002 (the ‘Agreement’) with Gawsia Developers Limited (the ‘Developer’), represented by its Chairman Mr. A   for developing the land measuring 0.4620 acres out of 0.4845 acres by way of constructing 15 storied building consisting of 112 apartments and necessary Car parks in the ground floor of the Building. It appears from the Agreement that the Developer will get 80% of the apartments and Car parking space along with undivided and undemarcated proportionate land and the Landowner will get 20% of the apartments.From certified copy of General Power of Attorney No. 397 dated 01.02.2003 executed by Mr. A   it appears that the landowner   appointed Gawsia Developers Limited, represented by its Chairman Mr. A  , having registered Office at 109/1, Kakrail Road, P. S. Ramna, District-Dhaka (the Developer) empowering its to develop the land measuring 0.4620 acres out of 0.4845 acres by way of constructing 15 (fifteen) storied building containing 112 apartments and necessary Car Parking spaces in the ground floor of the building and to sell the same alongwith proportionate undivided and undemarcated land and Car parking space as per agreement mentioned above.
<p>From your letter it appears that Company 1  will purchase an apartment from the Landowner/Developer. In such situation, Bank may obtain a registered Agreement for Sale executed by and between the borrower Company 1, the landowner through his constituted attorney Developer and clearly mentioning the time for transferring the apartment along with undivided and undemarcated land by way of a Deed of Sale. Thereafter the Bank may finance to the borrower Company 1 on the basis of a Tripartite Agreement stipulating inter alia that within a certain period after registration of the apartment in the name of Company 1, he will create mortgage over the same in favour of the Bank.</p>
