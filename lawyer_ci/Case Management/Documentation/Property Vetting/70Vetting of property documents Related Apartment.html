Physical possession of the owner over the apartment must be ascertained and documents/papers referred in Clause 13 above should be obtained.Unregistered Deed of Agreement for Sale dated 21.05.2007 has been submitted from which it appears that the Property-owner entered into an agreement with one Mr. “W” to sell the Apartment along with undivided and undemarcated land measuring 1.2333 decimal. If the Deed of Agreement for Sale dated 21.05.2007 is not submitted for registration within 30 (thirty) days then it will have no legal effect.We have provided this opinion on the basis of the documents/papers referred to us. We can not guarantee the genuineness of the documents. You may verify the genuineness of submitted documents with the concerned Sub-registry office or concerned authorities.</td>
