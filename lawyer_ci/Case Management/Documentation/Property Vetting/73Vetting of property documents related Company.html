<h1>Opinion</h1>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="27">:</td>
<td valign="top" width="384">Upon perusal of the documents/papers we are of the opinion that Mrs. B, Mr. C, Mr. D, Mr. E, Mr. F, Mrs. G, Mrs. H, Mrs. I, Mrs. J and Mr. K(the ‘landowners’) have acquired prima facie right, title and interest over the land in question. Physical possession of the landowners over the land should be ascertained and wanting documents/papers referred in Clause 13 above should be obtained.
<p>Memorandum of Declaration dated 10.03.2005 has been submitted from which it appears that Mrs. B come to an understanding with Company 1 (‘GBBPL’) to engage GBBPL to construct a 07 storied building comprising 24 apartments over the land. In the Memorandum of Declaration dated 10.03.2005, Mrs. B undertook to cancel the agreement previously executed between the landowners and Palalik Prakalpa Limited through which it was engaged to construct building and apartments over the land.</p>
<p>Deed of Cancellation dated 10.03.2005 has been submitted from which it appears that Mr. Y, Mr. D, Mr. E, Mr. F,Mrs. B, Mrs. G, Mrs. H executed a Deed of Agreement dated 20.08.2004 with Palalik Prakalpa Limited to construct building over the land. Subsequently, a Deed of Cancellation was executed in between parties of the Deed of Agreement Dated 20.08.2004 cancelling the Deed of Agreement Dated 20.08.2004. <strong>Please note that we did not found signatures of </strong><strong>Mr. E,Mrs. B, Mrs. G, Mrs. H and any seal of Palalik Prakalpa Limited in the signing part of the Deed of Cancellation dated 10.03.2005. On execution of the Deed of Cancellation dated 10.03.2005 stamp duty was not paid. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Please ensure whether Palalik Prakalpa Limited was executed the Deed of Cancellation dated 10.03.2005.</strong></p>
<p>Deed of Agreement dated 17.03.2005 (the ‘Agreement’) has been submitted from which it appears that Mr. Y, Mr. D, Mr. E, Mr. F,Mrs. B, Mrs. G, Mrs. H entered into an agreement with GBBPL to construct a 07 storied building comprising 24 apartments and car parking space (numbers are flexible on reasonable causes) over the land. According to the Agreement, the ownership of 24 apartments along parking spaces to be divided equally in between the said parties.</p>
<p>We have been provided with certified copy Irrevocable General Power of Attorney No. 9593 dated 08.12.2005 (‘IGPA’) from which it appears that the Landowner appointing the GBBPL as their true and lawful attorney empowering the attorney inter alia to develop the land by way of constructing building and to take loan for the purpose of construction of the building and to mortgage the same. <strong>But there is no provision to delegate the power of GBBPL, in this situation the Attorney cannot execute the Irrevocable General Power of Attorney in favour of the Bank. Therefore, a fresh Power of Attorney with the sub-delegation authority may be obtained upon revoking the previous IGPA. Alternatively mortgage and Power of Attorney can be created in favour of the Bank by the Landowners themselves.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Please note that no document/paper has been referred to us showing that the IGPA was accepted by the Ministry of Housing &amp; Public Works</strong>.</p>
<p>In such situation we are of the opinion that Developer can take loan from the Bank against mortgage of the land in question for the purpose of construction of the land in question subject to obtaining <strong>(i) document/paper showing that the Power of Attorney in favour of the GBBPL has been accepted by the Ministry of Housing &amp; Public Works and (ii) permission of the Ministry of Housing &amp; Public Works to mortgage land in question in favour of the Bank.</strong></p>

Physical possession of the landowner over the land should be ascertained and wanting documents/papers referred in Clause 13 above should be obtained.
<p>Deed of Agreement dated 04.08.2005 has been submitted from which it appears that Anwarul Kabir entered into an agreement with Company 1 (GBBPL) to construct a 06 storied building comprising 10 apartments over the land.</p>

<p>Please note that in Clause 13 of the IGPA it has been stated that the GBBPL can take loan from the any schedule Bank, HBFC or any financial Institution or any person for the purpose of constructing building over the land in question <strong>without creating any charge or mortgage on the schedule land</strong>.</p>
<p>In view of the above we are of the opinion that GBBPL has no authority to create mortgage over the land in question and there is no provision to delegate the power of GBBPL, in this situation the Attorney cannot execute any mortgage deed and Irrevocable General Power of Attorney in favour of the Bank. Therefore, a fresh Power of Attorney with the power to create any charge or mortgage over the land in question and with the sub-delegation authority may be obtained upon revoking the previous IGPA. Alternatively mortgage and Power of Attorney can be created in favour of the Bank by the Landowner himself.</p>
