<h1>Opinion</h1>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="27">:</td>
<td valign="top" width="384">Upon perusal of the documents/papers we are of the opinion that Mrs. B, Mr. C, Mr. D, Mr. E, Mr. F, Mrs. G, Mrs. H, Mrs. I, Mrs. J and Mr. K(the ‘landowners’) have acquired prima facie right, title and interest over the land in question. Physical possession of the landowners over the land should be ascertained and wanting documents/papers referred in Clause 13 above should be obtained.
<p>Memorandum of Declaration dated 10.03.2005 has been submitted from which it appears that Mrs. B come to an understanding with Company 1 (‘GBBPL’) to engage GBBPL to construct a 07 storied building comprising 24 apartments over the land. In the Memorandum of Declaration dated 10.03.2005, Mrs. B undertook to cancel the agreement previously executed between the landowners and Palalik Prakalpa Limited through which it was engaged to construct building and apartments over the land.</p>
<p>Deed of Cancellation dated 10.03.2005 has been submitted from which it appears that Mr. Y, Mr. D, Mr. E, Mr. F,Mrs. B, Mrs. G, Mrs. H executed a Deed of Agreement dated 20.08.2004 with Palalik Prakalpa Limited to construct building over the land. Subsequently, a Deed of Cancellation was executed in between parties of the Deed of Agreement Dated 20.08.2004 cancelling the Deed of Agreement Dated 20.08.2004. <strong>Please note that we did not found signatures of </strong><strong>Mr. E,Mrs. B, Mrs. G, Mrs. H and any seal of Palalik Prakalpa Limited in the signing part of the Deed of Cancellation dated 10.03.2005. On execution of the Deed of Cancellation dated 10.03.2005 stamp duty was not paid. We have not been provided with the Deed of Agreement dated 20.08.2004.</strong></p>
<p>Deed of Agreement dated 17.03.2005 (the ‘Agreement’) has been submitted from which it appears that Mr. Y, Mr. D, Mr. E, Mr. F,Mrs. B, Mrs. G, Mrs. H entered into an agreement with GBBPL to construct a 07 storied building comprising 24 apartments and car parking space (numbers are flexible on reasonable causes) over the land. According to the Agreement, the ownership of 24 apartments along parking spaces to be divided equally in between the said parties.</p>
<p>It appears upon perusal of submitted certified Irrevocable General Power of Attorney No. 9593 dated 08.12.2005 (‘IGPA’) that the landowners have executed the Irrevocable General Power of Attorney No. 9593 in favour of GBBPL empowering it inter alia to sell 16 apartment out of 28 apartments and 12 car parking space out of 24 car parking space along with proportionate undivided and undemarcated land to the prospective buyers. <strong>In the IGPA, GBBPL is empowered to mortgage the land. But there is no specific clause empowering GBBPL to sub-delegate its power. However, on the basis of the IGPA, GBBPL will not be able to execute a Irrevocable General Power of Attorney in favour of the Bank to sell the land or property in case of default of the repayment of the loan. We have not been provided with any Letter of Acceptance showing acceptance the IGPA by the Ministry of Housing and Public Works.</strong> <strong>Without acceptance of the IGPA by Ministry of Housing and Public Works, the IGPA shall not come into effect. </strong></p>
