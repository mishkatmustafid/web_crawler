Bank may accept the property as security of loan subject to obtaining documents/papers referred in clause 13 above.<strong>Please note that R. Z. Knit Fashions Limited at present does not have the power to execute Third Party Mortgage securing the loan to be given to GDS Chemicals BD (Pvt) Ltd. in favour of the Bank because the Company does not have the said power in their Memorandum of Association. Therefore, before executing the Mortgage formalities the Bank should ensure that R. Z. Knit Fashions Limited has changed its Memorandum of Association accordingly</strong>.
