<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="360">Unregistered Land Lease Agreement dated 20.12.2004 (the ‘Lease Agreement’) executed between Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority and Company 1 has been submitted. It appears from the Land Lease Agreement dated 20.12.2004 that Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority (BEPZA) in favour of Company 1 (EIBDL) has leased out 02 (two) Plots being No. 90 and 91 measuring 4000 square meters (the ‘Property’) approximately which are the part and parcel of the Comilla Export Processing Zone situated in within District Comilla, P.S. Kotowali under Comilla Export Processing Zone for 30 (thirty) years.As per the Lease Agreement, EIBDL is not empowered to create charge over the land. To take loan EIBDL may create charge over the leasehold interest in the land under the said plots upon taking written approval from the BEPZA. In case of default by EIBDL, the lender will not enforce the charge by transferring the leasehold interest to any one unless the proposed transferee is an enterprise/company duly approved by BEPZA for operation in the Comilla Export Processing Zone.
<p><strong>Please note that the Lease Agreement is not witnessed, which should be duly witnessed.</strong></p></td>
