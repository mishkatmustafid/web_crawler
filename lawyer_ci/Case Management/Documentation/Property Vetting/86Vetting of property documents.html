<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="384">Without perusing khatians it is not possible to ascertain complete chain of ownership of the schedule property.Upon perusal of Deed of Deed of Sale No.1734 dated 10.03.1952, it appears that land measuring 33 decimal under C.S. Khatian No. 33 and 8, Dag No. 164 and 165 was originally owned by Abdul Bepari.Abdul Bepari sold the land to Khan Shaheb Mohammad Abdul Jabbar vide Deed of Deed of Sale dated 13.02.1948.
