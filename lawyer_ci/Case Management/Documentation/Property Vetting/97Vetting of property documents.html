<td valign="top" width="132">Opinion</td>
<td valign="top" width="24">:</td>
<td style="text-align: justify;" valign="top" width="420">Upon perusal of the documents/papers we are of the opinion that Mr. Mr. A (the ‘Landowner’) has acquired prima facie right, title and ownership over the land in question. Physical possession of the present owner over the land should be ascertained and documents/papers referred in Clause 13 above should be obtained.The Landowner entered into Deed of Agreement dated 28.02.2001 (the ‘Development Agreement’) with Home Craft Limited represented by its Managing Director Mr. Ishtiaq Hossain (the ‘Developer’) through which the Developer on condition that the Developer shall construct a 6 storied building comprising 10 apartments more or less 2,400 sft. each over land measuring <strong>9.44 Katha</strong>.
<p>As per the said Development Agreement, the Landowner shall get in total 05 (five) apartments out of which 4 (four) apartments on the 1<sup>st &amp;</sup> 2<sup>nd</sup> floor and 01 apartment on north side of the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor and the Developer will get the rest 05 (five) apartments along with undivided and undemarcated proportionate land. Thereafter the Land Owner executed and registered Irrevocable General Power of Attorney No. 8193 dated 23.06.2003 (the “IGPA”) appointing the Developer empowering it inter alia sell its apartments to the prospective buyers. The IGPA was accepted by RAJUK vide Memo No. RAJUK/ESTATE/95(1)STHA dated 08.01.2004.</p>
<p>From Deed of Agreement dated 02.10.2003 executed between the Developer and Mr. M. Golam Faruk it appears that Mr. M. Golam Faruk will purchase four apartments out of which two on 4<sup>th</sup> &amp; two on 5<sup>th</sup> floor of the building.</p>
<p>From Supplementary Deed of Agreement dated 11.03.2004 executed between the Developer and Mr. M. Golam Faruk it appears that the Developer has agreed to handover the entire construction of the project to Mr. M. Golam Faruk and for amendment the design of the building and apartments and restrict some of the common facilities. It also appears that the Developer will execute Sale deed in favour of Mr. M. Gulam Faruk after construction of the building.</p>
<p>Please note that the landowner was required to be made party in both the original Deed of Agreement dated 02.10.2003 and Supplementary Deed of Agreement dated 11.03.2004.  However, in such situation Bank may obtain a Letter of Ratification whereby the landowner shall ratify appointment of Mr. Faruk by the developer to complete the construction.</p>
<p>Bank may obtain a registered Agreement for Sale to be executed between Mrs. “M” and the landowner (through his constituted attorney the Developer) clearly mentioning the time for transferring the apartments along with undivided and undemarcated land by way of a Deed of Sale. Mr. M. Gulam Faruk must witness in the said registered Agreement for Sale.</p>
<p>Upon obtaining aforesaid Agreement for Sale, the Bank may finance to Mrs. “M” on the basis of an Agreement to be executed between the Bank, Mrs. “M”, the landowner (through his constituted attorney) and the Developer and Mr. Golam Faruk stipulating inter alia that within a certain period after registration the apartment along with proportionate undivided and undemarcated proportionate land in her name, Mrs. “M” will create mortgage over the same in favour of the Bank.</p>
<p>We have provided this opinion on the basis of the documents/papers referred to us. We can not guarantee the genuineness of the documents. You may verify the genuineness of submitted documents with the concerned Sub-registry office or concerned authorities.</p></td>
