<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p><strong>RE:     LEGAL OPINION ON PROP</strong><strong>OSE</strong><strong>D TRIPARTITE AGREEMENT BETWEEN COMPANY 1 AND BANK 1. </strong></p>
<p>We refer to your letter dated 02 November 2006 on the above subject.</p>
<p>We have perused the contents of your letter and the proposed tripartite agreement to be executed between Airway 1 (“EA”), Mr. X and Co (“COMPANY 1”) and Bank 1 (“BANK 1”).</p>
<p>Please note that in our opinion the Agreement is not a standard tripartite agreement. The Agreement does not have any preamble, any clauses relating to undertakings/ covenants/representations/warranties of the respective parties, clauses relating to the termination of the agreement or clauses relating to resolution of disputes.</p>
<p>Our opinion is restricted to the terms and conditions set forth in the draft provided:</p>

If it is a Company then the   name of the company should include “Limited” at the end moreover, a company   does not have partners so it could not be stated that it is represented by   its Partner Mr. ABC (this too does not appear to be his real name). Please   check the matter and make corrections accordingly.</td>

<td valign="top" width="413">This clause only states that the service will be   provided for a fee of BDT 20,000 to be paid monthly basis by the Contractor.   This clause does not state whether BANK 1 needs any confirmation from the   Client that the service has been provided by the Service Provider before   paying the fees, on which date of the month this fee will be payable by the BANK   1 or how BANK 1 will be reimbursed by the Client for the amount paid.

BANK 1 as the Bank should file   the return to Bangladesh Bank based on the information given by the Service   Provider. The Client should reimburse BANK 1 for any remittable amount paid   by BANK 1 on their behalf to Bangladesh Bank. If the Client fails to pay any   amount due from it to BANK 1, then BANK 1 may deduct an amount equal thereto   from the Client’s Account. Any queries and enquires of Bangladesh Bank should   be answered by the Client or the Service Provider not BANK 1. We suggest that   Clause 4 be revised to include these terms.</td>
