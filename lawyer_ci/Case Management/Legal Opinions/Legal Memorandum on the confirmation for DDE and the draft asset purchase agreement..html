<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mr. Z</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Address….</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">RE:     Legal Memorandum on the confirmation for DDE and the draft asset purchase agreement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We refer to your email dated 04 January 2006 on the above subject. In this legal memorandum, we have dealt with the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Part 1</span>: </strong>Confirmation for DDE and the draft asset purchase agreement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Part 2</span>:</strong> Email from Mr. A, General Manager Company 1, to Mr. X. claiming that COMPANY 2 has made certain ‘verbal warranties’ and requested for written confirmation of the same.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Part 1: Confirmation for DDE and the draft asset purchase agreement.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Confirmation for DDE:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Company 3, the local legal counsel of Company 4 (“Company 4”) has asked COMPANY 2 (“COMPANY 2”) to provide a confirmation for DDE (“the Confirmation”).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In this regard, Company 3 has sent a draft confirmation for the perusal of COMPANY 2. COMPANY 2 has revised and edited this draft confirmation and has sent it to us for our legal vetting.  There are some overlaps between the Confirmation and the Warranties in Schedule 5 of the Draft Asset Purchase Agreement (“the Agreement”) however after discussion with Mr. X. on the 14-01-2007 we are of the opinion that:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The following are our observations regarding the Confirmation:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1.      Although Clause a of the Confirmation partially covered in Article 6.1.1 of Schedule 5 of the Agreement we are of the opinion that local COMPANY 2 has not objection accepting the clause with slight modifications. We have tailored Clause a to be more specific.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2.      We are of the opinion that, the words ‘onerous covenants’ in Clause d of the Confirmation may be deleted as this is covered by Article 8.2.8 of Schedule 5.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3.      We are of the opinion that Clause f of the Confirmation may be deleted as a new lease agreement has been executed in relation to the property located at Maijdee.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">4.      We are of the opinion that Clause p of the Confirmation may be deleted as this is covered by Article 4.3 of Schedule 5.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">5.      Please note that, during the discussion with Mr. X. of COMPANY 2 on 21 January 2007, we were informed that although COMPANY 2 will transfer all computer hardware to Company 4 on 1 January 2008, COMPANY 2 will only provide Company 4 licence to use the their software (which has been developed and is owned by COMPANY 2) up to 31 December 2007.  After 31 December, Company 4 will no longer be allowed to use the software supplied by COMPANY 2. Hence the software is not one of the assets to be transferred.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We have revised the Confirmation in consultation with Mr. x. of COMPANY 2. The revised version of the Confirmation is attached herewith.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Part 2: </span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Email from Mr. Brett Marshall to Mr. Sarwar A. Khan claiming that COMPANY 2 has made certain ‘verbal warranties’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Mr. A, General Manager Company 4., in his email dated 17 January 2007 to Mr. X. stated that COMPANY 2 had made certain ‘verbal warranties’ and have included in his email ten such verbal warranties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Mr. A, in his email, also requested COMPANY 2 to arrange written confirmation for the ‘verbal warranties’. From our discussion with Mr. X, it is clear that there may have been some miscommunication with regard to the ‘verbal warranties’ and our comments of the ‘verbal warranties’ are as follows:</p>
