<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mr. Z</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Address….</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Dear Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>RE:</strong> <strong>Legal Opinion for settlement of ACU$ 3,52,250.00 debitted by Bank 1, Kolkata in compliance with the order of Kolkata High Court, A/C Company 1</strong><strong>. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We refer to your letter dated December 26, 2007 and February 11, 2008 and our letter dated January  08, 2008 on the above subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">From perusal of your letter and the provided documents it appears that, Company 1, through Bank 2 (“BANK 2”) opened a Letter of Credit (“L/C”) in favour of M/S COMPANY 1 (L/C Beneficiary). Bank of India was the bank of the L/C Beneficiary and Bank 1 (“Bank 1”) was the advising Bank. Dispute arose regarding payment under the L/C and the L/C Beneficiary took the matter to the court in India. On 6 November 2006, the High Court at Calcutta in G.A. No. 2921 of 2006, Apot No. 472 of 2006. C.S. No. 678 of 1999 passed a decree for US$ 3,52,250.00 against BANK 2 in favour of Bank of India to be credited by Bank of India to the account of the L/C Beneficiary and also directed that the decree shall be satisfied from the funds lying with Bank 1.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In accordance with the said decree of the High Court at Calcutta, Bank 1 remitted US$ 3,52,250.00 to Bank of India by debiting the ACU$ A/C of BANK 2 maintained with Bank 1. The amount was blocked since 22 December 1999 at BANK 2’s Nostro A/C with Bank 1 vide an order of injunction passed by the High Court at Calcutta. But vide the said decree dated 6 November 2006 of the High Court at Calcutta, upon such payment, the injunction order was vacated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Company 1 has Tk. 69,80,888.68 in 4 (four) un-encumbered A/Cs (“Un-encumbered A/Cs”) and Tk. 45,88,047.00 in 1 (one) encumbered A/C (“Encumbered A/C”) lying with the Khatungonj Branch, Chittagong of BANK 2.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the circumstances stated above, you require our legal opinion on the following issues:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Query 1. </strong><strong>Whether the </strong><strong>Khatungonj Branch of BANK 2 should respond to the remitted amount of US$ 3,52,250.00 by Bank 1 from A/C of BANK 2 maintained with Bank 1 by debiting the amount from the accounts of Company 1 maintained with the Khatungonj Branch?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Response:</strong> A bank has a right under law to set off a debt owing to a customer against a debt due from the Bank. Therefore, BANK 2 may debit amounts from the accounts of Company 1 maintained with the Khatungonj Branch in order to set off the <strong>US$ </strong>3,52,250.00 remitted by Bank 1 from A/C of BANK 2 maintained with Bank 1.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Query 2. </strong><strong>If so then which head of account should be debited?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Response:</strong> BANK 2 may set off the said amount from the 4 (four)<strong> </strong>Un-encumbered A/Cs of of Company 1 maintained with the Khatungonj Branch. And provided that, the Encumbered Account is encumbered against the L/C in question, then BANK 2 may also set off from this Encumbered Account. However, if the Encumbered Account is encumbered against a separate L/C then BANK 2 should refrain from setting off from the Encumbered Account as it will compromise the security taken for the said separate L/C.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Query 3. </strong><strong>After adjusting part of the amount from the </strong><strong>accounts of Company 1 maintained with the Khatungonj Branch, whether BANK 2 may create forced loan account for the remaining amount?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Response: </strong>After setting off,<strong> </strong>we are of the opinion that, BANK 2 may create forced loan account for the remaining amount against the name of Company 1 to protect the interest of BANK 2.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If you have any further query, please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Thanking you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Yours faithfully,</p>
