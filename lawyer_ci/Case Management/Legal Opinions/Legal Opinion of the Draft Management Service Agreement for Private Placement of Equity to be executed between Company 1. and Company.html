<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p><strong>Re:      Legal Opinion of the Draft Management Service Agreement for Private Placement of Equity to be executed between Company 1. and Company 2. </strong></p>
<p>We refer to your letter dated 02 April 2007 on the above subject.</p>
<p>We have perused the Draft Management Service Agreement (“the Agreement”) for Private Placement of Equity to be executed between Company 1. (“STS”) and Company 2. (“JKSB”).</p>
<p>According to Rule 2 (j) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (Merchant Banker and Portfolio Manager) Rules dated 24.04.1996 (“the Merchant Banker Rules”):</p>
<p>“<em>“Merchant Banker” means any person who on behalf of his client manages the client’s fund, or does underwriting business or as an underwriter, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">manager or adviser is connected with securities</span> or as a Corporate Adviser provides services in order to perform all works in relation to issue management.”</em></p>
<p>And according to Section 2 (l) of the Securities and Exchange Ordinance, 1969, “Securities” includes <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stock, transferable share</span>, script, note, debenture etc <span style="text-decoration: underline;">issued or to be issued by or for the benefit of a company, whether incorporated in Bangladesh or not</span>.</p>
<p>After perusal of the Agreement it appears that STS will appoint JKSB as its exclusive agent in Sri Lanka to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">market and promote</span> the private placement of thirty five million ordinary shares of BDT 10.00 each to foreign investors. We are of the opinion that the obligations of JKSB under the Agreement may fulfill the definition of “Merchant Banker” under the Merchant Banker Rules.</p>
<p>If the work of JKSB falls under the definition of “Merchant Banker” then according to Rule 3 of the Merchant Banker Rules, JKSB would require registration certificate from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).</p>
<p>However, we would also like to point out that according to Rule 5(2) of the Merchant Banker Rules, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no stock broker is eligible</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to get a registration certificate of a merchant banker</span> from SEC. And from perusal of the Agreement we find JKSB is a stock broker in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>So we are of the opinion that JKBS may require the permission of SEC of Bangladesh to act as merchant banker because even though JKSB would be doing their business in Sri Lanka they would in fact be dealing with securities issued in Bangladesh. We are also of the opinion that there is a possibility that SEC may refuse to provide Merchant Banker certificate to JKSB because JKSB is a stock broker.</p>
<p>Subject to our above opinion, we are providing our comments on the Agreement below:</p>

<td valign="top" width="483">In   Clause 3(c) the term “local issue manager” has been used. Please define this   term.

<td valign="top" width="483">The   conditions contained in Clause 4.2.1, Clause 4.2.3 and Clause 4.3 are already   incorporated in Clause 2.1 as such we suggest you to delete these clauses. After   this, Clause 4.2 should be revised as follows:
<p>“4.2  Obtain the relevant approval from Bangladesh Bank   for the outward remittance of the dividends and/or other capital payable by   STS to the eventual investors of the Shares (“the Investors”).”</p>
<p>In clause 4.4, the term ‘local Issue Management agents’ has been used   but in Clause 3(c)   the term “local issue manager” has been used. Please decide which term to use   among these two and use that term uniformly throughout the agreement.</p>
<p>Please   delete Clause 4.5 and replace it with the following:</p>
<p>“4.5  Issue share certificates or documents in   lieu of certificates to the Investors.”</p></td>

<td valign="top" width="129">Clause 5</td>
<td valign="top" width="483">The   obligations of JKBS in clause 5 is vague and limited to a single line. We are   of the opinion that STS should ask JKSB to submit a letter of proposal in   which JKSB shall describe their capabilities and the specific services that   JKSB is offering to provide to STS.  The   letter of proposal should also give the list of clients that JKSB currently   has and who among those clients have a possibility of becoming Investors in   the Shares of STS.
<p>Relying   on the letter of proposal, Clause 5 should be re-drafted.</p></td>

<p>Also   note that, according to Clause 8.4 (III), the Agreement shall be governed by   and construed in all respect by the laws of Sri Lanka. We are of the opinion that the   laws of Sri Lanka is not appropriate because STS   and their legal representatives may not have knowledge about this law. We   suggest that the laws of a neutral third country should apply, regarding which   the both the parties have common knowledge, for example the Laws of England   and Wales.</p></td>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="129">Insertion   of a new Clause 8.10</td>
<td valign="top" width="483">Please   note that the agreement does not have any defined term during which it shall   remain effective. Without a defined term, STS would find it be very difficult   to enforce the agreement, for example STS may find it very difficult to   allege that JKSB has caused delay in performing their obligations under the   Agreement. As such we suggest that after Clause 8.9 you should add the   following clause 8.10:
<p>“8.10  Term</p>
<p>The   Agreement shall remain in force for _________years from the Effective Date   (“the Term”). JKSB shall perform their obligations under Clause 5 within this   Term.”</p></td>
