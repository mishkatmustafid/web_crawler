<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p><strong>Re:      Legal Opinion of the Draft Term Sheet for Private Placement of Equity sent by Company 2. </strong></p>
<p>We refer to your letter dated August 27, 2007 and your electronic mail dated 5 September 2007 on the above subject.</p>
<p>We have perused the Draft Term Sheet (“Term Sheet”) for private placement of equity sent by Company 2, managed by “X” South Asia Managers Limited (““X””) to be accepted by STS Holdings Ltd. (“STS”). Our comments on the Term Sheet are given below:</p>

<td valign="top" width="129">Clause 1.3</td>
<td valign="top" width="483">In the table contained in Clause   1.3 it is stated that, the issue of 41,160,000 shares worth US$ 15 Million @   Taka 25/- per share (with par value of TK 10/- each) shall raise the Paid-up   Capital of STS by TK. 1,029,000,000. This is incorrect, as according to the   relevant laws of Bangladesh, the premium value of shares   has to be transferred to an account called the “share premium account” and   does not form part of the paid up capital of a company, it only forms part of   the equity of the Company. The par value of shares form part of the paid up   capital of a company. Therefore, the issue of 41,160,000 shares shall raise   the Paid-up Capital of STS by TK. 411,600,000, and the rest of the amount   shall form part of STS’s equity. Therefore, we suggest you to delete “1,029,000,000”   in row 3, column 3 of the table and replace it with “411,600,000”.   “2,128,500,000” in row 4, column 3 of the table should also be deleted and   replaced with “1,511,100,000”.</td>

<td valign="top" width="129">Clause   1.4 and Appendix 1</td>
<td valign="top" width="483">According   to this clause, the ordinary shares which are going to be issued to “X” shall   be subject to the special terms and conditions set out in Appendix 1.
<p>According   to paragraph 1 of Appendix 1, in case of liquidation of STS, holders of New   Shares will receive in preference to all other shareholders per share value   shown in the table therein. Such preferential treatment in connection with   the holders of New Shares is not possible, because the shares that are going   to be issued are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ordinary shares</span> and preference at the time of winding   up/liquidation can only be provided to preference shareholders by law.</p>
<p>Therefore,   paragraph 1 of Appendix 1 cannot be implemented by law.</p>
<p>According   to paragraph 2 of Appendix 1, sale of all or substantially all of the assets   of the Company or a sale of shares involving a change in control, prior to a   listing will be treated in the same way as liquidation and proceeds of the   sale will be distributed as set out in paragraph 1.</p>
<p>It is   not clear from this paragraph, in case of a substantial sale of assets of STS   or change in control of STS, is “X” requiring STS to voluntarily wind up or   are they claiming for damages in the manner set forth in Paragraph 1.</p>
<p>Even   if there is no voluntary winding up, and “X” wants to claim the amount stated   in Paragraph 1, to give effect to the same, the Company will be required to   buy back their own shares which in this case requires approval from the High   Court and a valid case will have to be made out for obtaining the approval.   Please note that the mechanism for the shares to be redeemed is one which is   adopted for the redemption of preference shares but the shares to be issued   to “X” are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ordinary shares</span>.</p></td>

<td valign="top" width="129">Clause 1.5</td>
<td valign="top" width="483">According to Section 57(1) of the Companies Act 1994,   where a company issues shares at a premium, whether for cash or otherwise, a   sum equal to the aggregate amount or value of the premiums on those shares,   shall be transferred to an account, to be called “the share premium account”.
<p>According to Section 57(2) of the Companies Act 1994, the   share premium account <span style="text-decoration: underline;">may be applied</span> by the company—</p>
<p>(a) in paying up unissued shares of the   company to be issued to member of the company as fully paid bonus shares;</p>
<p>(b) in   writing of the preliminary expenses of the company,</p>
<p>(c) in   writing off the expenses of, or the commission paid or discount allowed, on   any issue of shares or debentures of the company; or</p>
<p>(d) in   providing for the premium payable on the redemption of any redeemable   preference shares or of any debentures of the company.</p>
<p>Therefore,   according to Companies Act, STS <span style="text-decoration: underline;">may</span> apply the share premium account in   the manner stated in the Act or apply it in any other way decided by the Board.   STS should ensure whether they want to apply the share premium account to   repay debt and for working capital purposes only as envisaged in Clause 1.5   of the Agreement.</p></td>

<td valign="top" width="129">Clause   2.1</td>
<td valign="top" width="483">According   to Clause 2.1, the terms of the offer are subject to STS adopting the “X”   “Business Principles and Environmental and Social Management System”. We have   not been provided with a copy of the same. Please check the contents of   principles and ensure that it contains no terms adverse to the interest of   STS.</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="129">Clause 2.3</td>
<td valign="top" width="483">According   to this Clause, STS is under a duty to take necessary steps to obtain a   listing in Dhaka Stock Exchange. Please check whether STS wants to convert   into a listed company as stipulated by this Clause.</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="129">Clause 2.4</td>
<td valign="top" width="483">According   to this Clause, STS is under a duty to pay a minimum dividend payout of 50%   of profit after tax attributable for equity holders after payment of preference   shareholders. Dividends can only be paid out of the profit the company and it   is not possible to predict the profits of a company in advance. Therefore we   are of the opinion that STS should not covenant to pay 50% dividend.</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="129">Clause   2.6</td>
<td valign="top" width="483">According   to this clause, in the event of any other investor being offered better   rights or privileges than “X”, then “X” shall automatically be entitled to   such rights and privileges.
<p>Section 71 of the Companies Act 1994   protects the rights of holders of different classes of shares by requiring   that to change their rights there should be a provision to that extent in the   memorandum or articles of association and that these should be sanctioned by   a specified majority of shareholders of that class. Any number of dissenting   members holding at least ten percent of the issued Shares of that class may   within fourteen days of the resolution apply to the Court for cancellation of   the resolution and such resolution shall not be effective until it is then   confirmed by the Court.</p>
<p>Therefore,   the rights and obligations of “X” cannot be automatically changed.</p></td>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="129">Clause   2.7 and 2.8</td>
<td valign="top" width="483">According   to these clauses STS shall stop Placement after a period of 30 days from the   disbursement of investment by “X”. Any attempts by STS to raise new   investment by issuing shares after the said 30 days has to comply with two   conditions contained therein. It is a commercial decision as to whether STS   should accept these two clauses or not.
<p>With   regard to the requirement that the shares are to be sold at a value above   Tk.25.00:</p>
<ul>
<li>This may subject to approval from the SEC hence it will be to the   extend permissible by law;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The value of the Company is not at a standstill and hence how long   does “X” intends to place this restriction?</li>
</ul>
<p>With   regard to issue of shares at no cost to “X” in case shares are sold at a   price lower than Tk.25.00:</p>
<p>This   is a public company and “X” shall be shareholders holding ordinary shares   having the same rights, benefits and privileges as other ordinary   shareholders. A company does not have right to issue shares as fully paid-up   shares at no cost except bonus shares. If bonus shares are to be issued to “X”,   the same shall have to be issued to other shareholders under the same terms   and conditions.</p></td>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="129">Clause   3.3</td>
<td valign="top" width="483">According   to Clause 3.3, certain key decisions of STS shall require the consent of “X”   or their Nominee Director who will have the casting vote.
<p>Generally   shareholders having 9.1% do not make major management decisions unless they   have special skills or know how for business. However it is a commercial   decision.</p></td>

In order to implement such   rights, changes shall have to be made in the Articles of Association of STS   by Special Resolution.</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="129">Clause   6</td>
<td valign="top" width="483">This   Clause states that the Articles of Association shall be reviewed and   amendments recommended by the “X”’s lawyers. Please Check whether STS agrees   to allow “X” to make such amendments to its Artilces of Association.   Moreover, such amendments have to be by Special Resolution passed in a   General meeting of STS.</td>
