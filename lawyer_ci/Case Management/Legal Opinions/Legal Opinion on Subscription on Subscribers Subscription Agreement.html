<p>RE:     OPINION ON SUBSCRIBER’S SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>We refer to your letter dated ………………regarding the captioned subject.</p>
<p>We have been sent the Subscription Agreement utilised by Sheba. ISL now intends to use the same for their subscribers  under rural licence. In that situation, ISL has sent us the aforesaid agreement for vetting.</p>
<p>We have perused the aforesaid Agreement and our observations are as follows:</p>

<td valign="top" width="42"><strong>Sl.</strong></td>
<td valign="top" width="114"><strong>Clause</strong></td>
<td valign="top" width="306">Observation
<p><strong> </strong></p></td>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="42">01</td>
<td valign="top" width="114">Nomenclature and logo</td>
<td valign="top" width="306">The title of the Agreement “Shebaaccess   Subscription Agreement”  is suggested   to be replaced  with “ Subscription   Agreement”.
<p>The logo of Sheba   is also required to  be replaced.</p>
<p>The term “Sheba”   is advised to be replaced with “ISL” throughout the entire Agreement.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="42">02</td>
<td valign="top" width="114">Address clause</td>
<td valign="top" width="306">In the bottom of page 1, address of   Sheba Telecom  is  suggested to replace with the address of   ISL.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="42">03</td>
<td valign="top" width="114">1.2</td>
<td valign="top" width="306">We have not been told as   to whether ISL shall run any radio communication system or not. If, they will   run the system, then it  is advised to   replace the term “Shebaaccess” with “ISLaccess”. Otherwise the  definition is suggested to be deleted.
<p>Suggested replacement   should be reflected throughout the entire Agreement.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="42">04</td>
<td valign="top" width="114">1.4 &amp; 1.5</td>
<td valign="top" width="306">For the sake of clarity,   it is advised to compile both the definitions in one as follows:
<p>“Customer means the   registered subscriber of the Service and/or the transmitter/receiver of   accessory/equipment for carrying on a radio communication service in   ISLaccess  as the case may be.”</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="42">05</td>
<td valign="top" width="114">4.3</td>
<td valign="top" width="306">As we understand, Tariff   may also fall due. It is    therefore  advised to insert   “Tariff” next to the word    “fees” .</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="42">06</td>
<td valign="top" width="114">4.4</td>
<td valign="top" width="306">It is s advised to insert   “Tariff” next to the word “ fees” .</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="42">07</td>
<td valign="top" width="114">5.1</td>
<td valign="top" width="306">Please ascertain whether   ISL is agreeable to 30 days notice period.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="42">08</td>
<td valign="top" width="114">5.3</td>
<td valign="top" width="306">The term “effective date   of termination” may cause future complication. It is thereby advised to   replace “prior or the effective date of termination” with “prior to the date   of termination”.</td>
</tr>
