<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p><strong>RE:     Legal Opinion regarding Maintenance Agreement for Optical fiber link. </strong></p>
<p>We refer to your letter dated 06  September 2007 on the above subject.</p>
<p>We have perused the draft Maintenance Agreement for Optical fiber link (“the Agreement”) to be executed between Bank 1 (“BANK 1”) and Company 1 (“Alap”).</p>
<p>Our opinion on the Agreement is given below:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="161"><strong>Clause/Paragraph</strong></td>
<td valign="top" width="413"><strong>Comments</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="161">General</td>
<td valign="top" width="413">Please   ensure that the correct date on which this agreement is made is given at the   beginning of the Agreement instead of “15<sup>th</sup> Sep, 2007”.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="161">Clause 5.1.1</td>
<td valign="top" width="413">In   the second paragraph of Clause 5.1.1, please delete any reference to “Client”   and “CUSTOMER” and replace them with “BANK 1”. Also delete any reference to   “Alap” and replace them with “Company 1”.
<p>Please   note that, according to the second paragraph of this clause, HBSC will not be entitled to charge Alap penalty for   service interruption if it occurred from the reasons contained therein.   Please check whether BANK 1 agrees to such restriction in imposing penalties.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="161">Clause 6,2</td>
<td valign="top" width="413">In   this clause reference has been made to the duties and responsibilities of BANK   1 as mentioned in appendix 01. However, upon perusal of appendix 01 we were   unable to find any such duties and responsibilities of BANK 1 listed there.   Please check the matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="161">Clause 6.3</td>
<td valign="top" width="413">In   the fourth line of the second paragraph of Clause 6.3, we suggest you to   delete “withdrawal” and replace it with “withdraw”.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="161">Clause 9.4</td>
<td valign="top" width="413">In   the first line of Clause 9.4, please delete “my” and replace it with “its”.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="161">Clauses 11.1 and 15</td>
<td valign="top" width="413">Please   note that, according to Clause 14, the Agreement shall be governed by the   laws of Bangladesh and any suits, actions or   claims in relation thereto shall be filed exclusively in the proper courts of   Dhaka City. On the other hand in Clause 11.1 it is stated that any disputes   and difference arising out of the Agreement shall be settled by arbitration.   Therefore, according to Clause 15 and 11.1, the parties can go to the courts of Dhaka City or refer to Arbitration; this is not legally   possible. We draw your attention to Section 7 of   Arbitration Act 2001, according to which, where any of the parties to an arbitration   agreement files a legal proceedings to a Court against the other party, no   judicial authority shall hear any legal proceedings before completion of the   arbitration proceeding.
<p>Therefore, the   parties should select any one forum for the resolution of dispute not both. We   are of the opinion that arbitration should be selected. Therefore we suggest   you to delete Clause 15 and replace it with the following:</p>
<p>“14. Governing Law</p>
<p>This Agreement   shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Bangladesh.”</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="161">Addition of a new Clause 11.3</td>
<td valign="top" width="413">After   Clause 11.3 we suggest the addition of a new clause which should be as   follows:
<p>“11.3   If any dispute is referred to arbitration, in spite of such referral, at the   option of BANK 1, Company 1 should continue to provide the services under   this Agreement.”</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="161">Clause 13.3</td>
<td valign="top" width="413">We   are of the opinion that hartals and strikes are normally not events of force   majeure unless they continue without break for a long period of time. Please   discuss this issue with service provider.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="161">Clause 14.4</td>
<td valign="top" width="413">According   to this clause warranty to be given by Alap will be void, inter alia, for   failure of BANK 1 to maintain dust and damp free environment at BANK 1’s   premises. How shall it be determined whether BANK 1’s premises have been   maintained dust free or not? Who shall decide this? Please check whether BANK   1 agrees to this restriction.</td>
