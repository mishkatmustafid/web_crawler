<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p><strong>RE:     Legal Opinion regarding Maintenance Agreement for “W”. </strong></p>
<p>We refer to your letter dated 22 November 2006 and our previous opinion no. LKP/MHH/11/06 dated 8  November 2006 on the above subject.</p>
<p>You have asked us by your letter to clarify our previous opinion.</p>
<p>We have again perused the draft agreement for Office Automation Servers.</p>
<p>Our revised opinion on the draft agreement is given below:</p>

<td valign="top" width="161">Addition of a new Clause 1.3</td>
<td valign="top" width="435">After   Clause 1.2 we suggest the addition of a new clause which should be as   follows:
<p>“1.3   The 1<sup>st</sup> Party is aware of the need of BANK 1 and is competent and   possesses the requisite expertise to provide such services as needed.”</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="161">Clause 2.2</td>
<td valign="top" width="435">In   this clause it is stated that if any service <span style="text-decoration: underline;">request</span> is made from 20:00 to 22:00   hours then it will be treated as ‘Special Call Service’ but the 1<sup>st</sup> party will attend for necessary solution on mutually defined time. So in   effect the 1<sup>st</sup> Party may even attend for the solution during 09:00 to 20:00 of a working day if the parties so agrees. This   might mean that the 1<sup>st</sup> party will get Tk. 500 per hour for   working during ‘Regular Call Service’ hours just because the request was made   outside these hours. That is why we suggest that Clause 2.2 be deleted and   replaced with the following:
<p>“2.2   Any service rendered beyond 09:00 to 20:00 hours of a working day will be treated as ‘Special   Call Service’. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Party will inform the 1<sup>st</sup> party   about any trouble which has occurred in any of the listed items in Appendix-3   through telephone (Contact windows are mentioned in Appendix-2) or fax or   personally. The 1<sup>st</sup> party will attend for the necessary solution   on mutually defined time and will charge to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Party Tk. 500   (Taka five hundred) only per hour or any part thereof by issuing additional   invoice.”</p></td>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="161">Clause 2.4</td>
<td valign="top" width="435">The   second sentence of Clause 2.3 is not properly drafted and as such we suggest   that it be deleted and replaced with the following sentence:
<p>“If   the 1<sup>st</sup> Party fails to attend to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Party or solve   the problem as per defined time frame and if the 2<sup>nd</sup> Party claims   it by official letter or by phone call or by any means within the next _____   official days then payment will be decreased from the agreement value by Tk.   1000.00 (Taka one thousand) only per every additional hour or any part   thereof after the defined time frame and will be adjusted with the next   payment.”</p></td>

<td valign="top" width="161">Clause 5</td>
<td valign="top" width="435">Clause   5 is not properly drafted as such please deleted it and replace it with the   following:
