</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dear Sir,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>RE:      Legal Opinion regarding request of Doublemooring Police station to supply information and to submit Bank Account Statement of Mr. x in connection with C. R. Case no. …………</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Please refer to your letter dated 22 May 2007 on the above subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We have perused the papers/documents referred to us. It appears that a Sub-Inspector of Doublemooring Police Station (“Officer”) vide his letter dated 18 May 2007 has requested the Bank 1 to supply all relevant information and to submit Bank Account Statement of Mr. x in connection with C. R. Case no. 628/06.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>OUR OPINION:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The relevant laws for producing documents for investigation of offences by a Police Officer is stated in section 94 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 which provides as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“(1) Whenever any Court, or any officer in charge of a police-station considers that the production of any document or other thing is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code by or before such Court or officer, such Court may issue a summons, or such officer a written order, to the person in whose possession or power such document or thing is believed to be, requiring him to attend and produce it, or to produce it, at the time and place stated in the summons or order:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Provided that no such officer shall issue any such order requiring the production of any document or other thing which is in the custody of a bank or banker as defined in the Bankers’ Books Evidence Act, 1891 (XVIII of 1891), and relates, or might disclose any information which relates, to the bank account of any person except, –</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a)    for the purpose of  investigating an offence under sections 403, 406, 408 and 409 and sections 421 to 424 (both inclusive) and sections 465 to 477A (both inclusive) of the Penal Code, with the prior permission in writing of a Sessions Judge; and</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b)    in other cases, with the prior permission in writing of the High Court Division.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The restriction relating to non-disclosure applies to any document or other thing which is in the custody of a bank or banker and relates or might disclose any information which relates, to the bank account of any person. The documents and records for which the Officer has requested the Bank to supply are in custody of the Bank and might disclose information of the account of Mr. X</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">From perusal of the letter dated 18 May 2007 of the Officer it is not apparent under which sections of the Penal Code the Officer is conducting the investigation against Mr. X</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If the offences for which the investigation is being conducted by the Officer against Mr. x includes section 403, 406, 408 and 409 and sections 421 to 424 (both inclusive) and sections 465 to 477A (both inclusive) of the Penal Code then before issuing any order requiring the production of any documents or other things which are in the custody of the Bank, the Officer in charge shall require prior written permission from a Sessions Judge. In all other cases, the Officer in charge shall require prior written permission from the High Court Division of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the premises stated above, the Bank may inform the Officer concerned that, unless he produces order of the relevant Court to provide information and supply documents, the Bank shall be unable to supply the required information; otherwise, the Bank may be subjected to legal action by its client, Mr. X.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">

<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Thanking you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
