<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mr. Z</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Address….</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Dear Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>RE:     Legal Opinion regarding scope of liabilities against buying stock brokerage membership from 3<sup>rd</sup> party.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We refer to your letters no. <strong>COMPANY 1</strong>/Retail/481 dated 15April 2007 and <strong>COMPANY 1</strong>/Retail/483 dated April 18 2007 and our letter no. ……………. dated April 18, 2007 on the same subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">From perusal of your letters and the provided documents it appears that, Company 1 (“<strong>COMPANY 1</strong>”) is looking into the prospect of acquiring membership of Company 2 (“<strong>COMPANY 2</strong>”). Since there is no scope for applying for a fresh <strong>COMPANY 2</strong> Membership, <strong>COMPANY 1</strong> is considering buying a share of <strong>COMPANY 2</strong> from an existing member.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In this pursuit, <strong>COMPANY 1</strong> has been negotiating the price and formalities with an existing member, COMPANY 2, which bought this membership on April 03, 2006 from COMPANY 1 has yet to obtain registration certificate from Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to act as a stock broker.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In these circumstances, you have requested us to give our legal opinion as to the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1)      Legal standing of <strong>COMPANY 1</strong> in buying the membership from COMPANY 3, an existing member of <strong>COMPANY 2</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2)      Coverage against any future claim from the shareholders of COMPANY 3 and the proprietor of COMPANY 1.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3)      What other issues <strong>COMPANY 1</strong> should consider in order to protect its interest before negotiating the said transaction with COMPANY 3.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">4)      Any other legal issues that we consider necessary to be addressed regarding the matter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OUR OPINION</span></strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">From perusal of the provided documents, it appears that, COMPANY 1 bought a share of <strong>COMPANY 2</strong> being Share No. 08  (“the Share”) on April 03, 2006 from COMPANY 3 by executing a Deed of Agreement for Sale dated 3<sup>rd</sup> April 2006.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">From the letter dated 11 December 2006 of <strong>COMPANY 2</strong> signed by Mr. X, Chief Executive Officer (“<strong>COMPANY 2</strong> Letter”), it appears that the Council of <strong>COMPANY 2</strong> has ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">apparently</span>’ approved the transfer of the Share from COMPANY 1 to COMPANY 3. <strong>COMPANY 2</strong> Letter does not state whether the Council of <strong>COMPANY 2</strong> has approved the transfer of membership from COMPANY 1 to COMPANY 3.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Please note that according to Article 4 and 5 of the Articles of Association of <strong>COMPANY 2</strong>, to become a member of <strong>COMPANY 2</strong> the following steps has to be followed:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 4 (4): Every candidate for membership shall sign and deliver to the Secretary an application in the form contained in this article.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 4 (5): The application has to be proposed and seconded by 2 (two) existing members of <strong>COMPANY 2</strong>. The application has to be accompanied by such admission fee and annual subscription and other documents as may be decided by the Council of <strong>COMPANY 2</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 4 (6): The application and recommendation shall be placed before a meeting of the Council and if the Council considers it expedient to proceed further, the application shall be posted on the Notice Board of the <strong>COMPANY 2</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 4 (8): After the notice for application for membership has been on the notice board for 14 (fourteen) days, the Council shall within a reasonable time thereafter proceed to ballot for the election of a member. To be successful in the ballot, the candidate must receive in his favour two thirds of the votes recorded.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 5: Every firm elected by the Council as eligible for admission shall as condition precedent to his registration as a member:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(1)   Acquire and submit to the Council for registration a share certificate for one share in <strong>COMPANY 2</strong> together with a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">duly stamped and executed transfer deed</span> or letter of allotment in his favour of such share.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2)   Pay to <strong>COMPANY 2</strong> such sum as may be determined by the Council from time to time as an entrance fee.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">From perusal of the <strong>COMPANY 2</strong> Letter, it is not apparent whether the steps mentioned above has been followed. We advise <strong>COMPANY 1</strong> to inquire at <strong>COMPANY 2</strong> and seek whether COMPANY 3. is a member of <strong>COMPANY 2</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">After <strong>COMPANY 1</strong> is sure that COMPANY 3. is a member of <strong>COMPANY 2</strong>,  <strong>COMPANY 1</strong> may enter into a Share Sale Agreement with COMPANY 3, which contemplates and documents the whole implementation of the transactions leading to the transfer, from pre-closing conditions to be fulfilled prior to transfer and post closing conditions to be fulfilled after transfer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Please note that the share sale agreement shall not transfer the membership of <strong>COMPANY 2</strong> to <strong>COMPANY 1</strong>. For membership <strong>COMPANY 1</strong> shall have to apply to <strong>COMPANY 2</strong> in the method mentioned above or any other method authorised by <strong>COMPANY 2</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Also note that according to rule 6 (1) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (Stock – Dealer, Stock – Broker and Authorised representative) Rules, 2000, if a stock dealer or stock broker wishes to transfer its membership of a stock exchange, that stock dealer or stock broker has to submit its registration certificate to act as a stock dealer or stock broker, issued by SEC, to the stock exchange along with the application for transfer of membership. According to rule 6 (2), from the date the stock exchange approves the transfer of the membership, the registration certificate of the transferor to act as a stock dealer or stock broker, issued by SEC stands void.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, it is our opinion that, if COMPANY 1 has transferred the membership of <strong>COMPANY 2</strong> to COMPANY 3, the registration certificate of COMPANY 1, issued by SEC, to act as a stock dealer or stock broker is at present void.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">From your letter it appears that Crest Securities Limited has yet to obtain registration certificate from SEC to act as a stock broker.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So after obtaining the membership of <strong>COMPANY 2</strong>, <strong>COMPANY 1</strong> shall have to obtain the registration certificate from SEC to act as a stock dealer or stock broker. Only after obtaining the registration certificate, <strong>COMPANY 1</strong> may start trading as a stock dealer or stock broker.</p>
