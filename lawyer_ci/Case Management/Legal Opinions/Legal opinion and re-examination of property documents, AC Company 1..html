<p style="text-align:justify">Dear Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>RE:     Legal opinion and re-examination of property documents, A/C Company 1.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">We refer to your letter No. ………………… dated May 29, 2007 and our legal opinion No. …………………… dated 26 May, 2007 and the telephonic conversation on 06.06.2007 on the above subject.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In our opinion dated 26 May, 2007, we had asked Bank 1 o follow Approach 2, i.e. upon redemption of the mortgage on the 3 Floors by Bank 2, the Developer, on behalf of the Landowner, will sell the 3 Floors by executing Deed of Sales in favour of the Borrower; and the Borrower will then execute registered mortgage of the 3 Floors in favour of Bank 1as security for the loan given to the Borrower by Bank 1. Vide your letter, you have inform us that you shall follow Approach 2.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In our opinion dated 26 May, 2007, we had asked Bank 1to ascertain the ownership of the property. Vide your letter you have informed us that the said property had already been vetted by us for Mercantile Bank Limited vide our letter No. ………… dated 04.12.2004. Therefore, we do not need to vet the said property again.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In our opinion dated 26 May, 2007, we had also asked Bank 1to ascertain as to whether the Developer has the authority to sell 83,000 sq. ft. on the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> floors of the 15-storied commercial building. Vide your letter you have provided us a letter of the Landowner, COMPANY 1, dated 29.05.07 (“the Landowner Letter”) from which it appears that there has been a meeting on 28 April 2007 between the Landowner and the Developer whereby the parties have agreed that the Landowner shall be entitled for the following floor spaces:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">a)      Basement – 4992 sq. ft.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">b)      1<sup>st</sup> Floor  – 8320 sq. ft.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">c)      5<sup>th</sup> Floor – 30,500 sq. ft.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">d)      11<sup>th</sup> Floor – 22,082 sq. ft.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">However, this Landowner Letter is not adequate to legally amend the Deed of Agreement dated 24 August 2000 (“Development Agreement”). In our opinion, <u>both parties</u> shall have to sign an amendment agreement in order to amend the Development Agreement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">From the Development Agreement, the exact share of the Landowner and the Developer in the Building is not clearly demarcated, i.e. it is not clear as to which definite part of each floor belongs to which party; for example according to the Development Agreement the Landowner is entitled to 8320 sq. ft. on the 1<sup>st</sup> floor of the building but which part of the 1<sup>st</sup> floor belongs to the Landowner and which part belongs to the Developer is not clearly demarcated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Therefore, we advise Bank 1to request the Developer to execute an amendment agreement with the Landowner which shall clearly demarcate each other’s share in the Building and provide Bank 1with a copy of the same.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As requested by you over telephone, we have prepared a draft deed of mortgage and IGPA to be executed by Jeans Manufacturing Co. Ltd in favour of AB Bank.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><strong><u>Please note that</u></strong>, as no Deed of Sale has yet been executed in favour of Jeans Manufacturing Co. Ltd by the Developer and as the exact share of the Landowner and the Developer in the Building is not clearly demarcated in the development agreement, <u>we have left the schedule of property <strong>blank</strong> in the draft deed of mortgage and IGPA</u>. The Deed of Mortgage and IGPA should be executed only after the Developer has executed the Deed of Sale in favour of Jeans Manufacturing Co. Ltd and after Bank 1has filled up the blank schedule of property in the deed of mortgage and IGPA in accordance with the schedule of property in the executed Deed of Sale.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">All documents referred to us are returned herewith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Thanking you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Yours Faithfully,</p>
