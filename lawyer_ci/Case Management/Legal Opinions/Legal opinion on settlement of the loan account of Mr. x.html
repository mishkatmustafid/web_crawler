</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Dear Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Re:  Legal opinion on settlement of the loan account of Mr. x</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We refer to your letter dated 15.05.2006 on the above subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We have perused the documents/papers referred to us. We understand that Mr. x (the ”Borrower”) availed loan of Tk. 6,00,000.00 (Taka six lac) only from BANK 1. In order to adjust loan liability of the Borrower with BANK 1, the Borrower issued a cheque for Tk. 5,17,000.00 (Taka five lac seventeen thousand) only drawn on his account held with the BANK 1. On dishonour of the cheque for ‘insufficient fund’, BANK 1 filed Petition Case No. 3058 of 2003 against the Borrower under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Upon hearing, the Metropolitan Magistrate, 20<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka vide its Judgment dated ________ punished the borrower with imprisonment for a term to one year and imposed fine for Tk. 6,00,000.00 (Taka six lac) only. In the said Judgement the Magistrate directed the concerned Collector to collect the fine and after realisation of the fine, face value of the cheque i.e. Tk. 5,17,000.00 (Taka five lac seventeen thousand) only to give BANK 1.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Now mother of the Borrower Ms. A vide her letter dated 14.05.2006 requested the BANK 1 to inform her the outstanding of her son’s loan account to adjust it. In such situation you have sought our opinion what will be the procedure and amount to be considered for full and final settlement of the loan account. In your letter dated ________ it appears that</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the letter addressing us you have shown a calculation of the loan account as on 15.05.2006. In such situation you have sought our opinion what will be the procedure and amount to be considered for full and final settlement of the loan account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our opinion: </span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We are of the opinion that in respect of amount of the face value of the cheque i.e. Tk. 5,17,000.00 (Taka five lac seventeen thousand) only under the Judgement passed in the Petition Case No. 3058 of 2003 by the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate, 20<sup>th</sup> Court, BANK 1 may receive</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">BANK 1 may consider principal outstanding, up to date interest and previous legal expenses as the total outstanding of the loan account. BANK 1 may inform Ms. A that the total outstanding of the loan account as full and final settlement amount. Any amount of waiver to the borrower to the extent of accrued interest and previous legal expenses is at the sole discretion of BANK 1.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In case of issuance Letter of Satisfaction for the loan account, BANK 1 must states thereon that BANK 1 did not receive any further amount of the face value of the cheque i.e. Tk. 5,17,000.00 (Taka five lac seventeen thousand) only under the Judgement passed in the Petition Case No. 3058 of 2003 by the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate, 20<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka.</p>
