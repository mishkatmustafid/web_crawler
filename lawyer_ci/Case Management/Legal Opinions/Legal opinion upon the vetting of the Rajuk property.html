<p>However, the Bank may accept    the scheduled property as security in the form of legal mortgage against the    loan facility subject to obtain the papers/documents mentioned in Column No.    13 above.</p>
<p>Moreover the Bank, before creating mortgage upon    the scheduled property should verify the spot physically for ascertaining    the actual and peaceful possession of Company    1, represented by its Managing    Director Mr. B over the    scheduled property.</p>
<p>For this opinion, we have assumed    that:</p>
<ul>
<li>all signatures given in the documents/papers are genuine    and all documents/papers submitted to us as original are authentic and    complete.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>all representations and statements made with regard to    the documents by the parties are true and accurate.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will not be out of place to    mention here that the deed of mortgage supporting to be executed by the    owner that <strong>Company 1</strong><strong>,</strong> represented by    its Managing Director Mr. B will be    required to be filed with the Registrar Joint Stock Companies and Farms    within 21 days following the date of execution of the deed of mortgage.</p>
