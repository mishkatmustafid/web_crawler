Therefore, the <strong>Social Islami Bank Limited (SIBL) </strong>may accept the scheduled property as security in the form of legal mortgage against the Investment facility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover the Social Islami Bank Limited before creating mortgage upon the scheduled property should verify the spot physically for ascertaining the actual and peaceful possession of <strong>Mr. X</strong>over the scheduled property and collect all original copies instead of photocopies submitted to us.</p>
