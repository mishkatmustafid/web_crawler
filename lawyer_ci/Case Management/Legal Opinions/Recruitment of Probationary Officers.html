<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px">Dear Sir</span></span><br/>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>RE:      Recruitment of Probationary Officers.</strong></span></span><br/>
 </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px">We refer to your letter no. ………………. dated 12 October 2006 on the above subject.</span></span><br/>
 </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px">On perusal of your letter it appears that Bank 1 (“BANK 1”) on 27.02.06 gave an advertisement in the NEWSPAPER for the appointment of Probationary Officers. The period of probation is one year with monthly remuneration of Tk. 10,000/- only (consolidated) during the remuneration period. After completion of the probationary period the Probationary Officers were to be confirmed as Officers grade – I in the scale of pay of Tk. 6000-350-8100-13700/- with other allowances and benefits.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px">In the meantime the initial scale of Officer Grade – I has changed from Tk. 6000-350-8100-13700/- to Tk. 8000-550-1130-600-17900/-.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px">In response to the newspaper advertisement a good number of applications were received from which eligible candidates were called to appear in a written test. A merit list of the written test was prepared. From the top of the merit list 240 candidates were called for viva-voce and the successful candidates have been appointed as Probationary Officers who after successful completion of the probation period will be absorbed as Officer Grade – I with the new scale of pay.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Now, BANK 1 has further decided:</strong></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px">1.       to recruit a few further candidates from the top of the remaining merit list on the basis of the result of the written test and viva-voce as Probationary Officers, who will be absorbed as Officer Grade – I; and</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px">2.       to recruit 100 (one hundred) additional number of Probationary Officers to be absorbed in the lower grade, i.e. in the grade of Officer Grade – II (in the scale of pay of Tk. 6300-400-8300-500-13300) from the top of the remaining merit list of the written test after taking viva-voce. The consent of the concerned candidates with regard to offering post in the lower grade to be obtained before issuing appointment letter.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px">In these circumstances, you require our legal opinion regarding appointment of the additional 100 Probationary Officers who after successful completion of the probationary period will be absorbed as Officer Grade  – II.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong><u>OUR OPINION</u></strong>:</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px">According to law, the newspaper advertisement in the NEWSPAPER given by BANK 1 was an invitation to treat for the appointment of Probationary Officers to be absorbed as Officer Grade – I. Offers of employment were made to the eligible applicants who satisfied BANK 1 in the written test and viva-voce and recruitment of Officer Grade – I was thereafter closed.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px">As the advertisement in the NEWSPAPER was an invitation to treat for the appointment of Probationary Officers to be absorbed as <u>Officer Grade – I</u>, BANK 1 can rely on the advertisement for the appointment of Probationary Officers to be absorbed as <u>Officer Grade – II</u>, if it is expressly inform the remaining applicants on the merit list selected by BANK 1 that the offer for employment relates to recruitment of <u>Officer Grade – II</u></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px">This offer should be given before taking the viva-voce and should be given by a written letter posted to the addresses of the remaining applicants on the merit list.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px">Additionally, the letter should inform the recipients that the recruitment of applicants, for Probationary Officers to be absorbed as Officer Grade – I, has ended but BANK 1 is offering the letter receiver the opportunity to be appointed as Officer Grade – II; if the applicant consents to the offering of post in the lower grade with the scale of pay of Tk. 6300-400-8300-500-13300 then he should attend the viva-voce on a certain given date.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px">So it is our opinion that there are no legal restrictions in recruiting 100 additional Probationary Officers, to be absorbed as Officer Grade – II, from the remaining merit list provided that it has been expressly notified to such candidates that the post offered is a lower grade post <u>before</u> taking their viva-voce.</span></span></p>
