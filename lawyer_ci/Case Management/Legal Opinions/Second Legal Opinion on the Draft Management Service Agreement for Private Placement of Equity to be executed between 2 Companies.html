<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Re:      Second Legal Opinion on the Draft Management Service Agreement for Private Placement of Equity to be executed between Company 1 and Company 2. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We refer to your letter dated 02 April 2007 and 11 April 2007 and our letter dated 09 April 2007 on the above subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In your letter you have stated that as COMPANY 2’s role does not extend to managing its clients fund and will not extend to underwriting or advising COMPANY 1 on Placement, COMPANY 2 in your opinion does not fall under the definition of a merchant banker under Rule 2 (j) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (Merchant Banker and Portfolio Manager) Rules dated 24.04.1996.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the Rule  any person who is a <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">manager or adviser connected with securities </span></em></strong>falls under the definition of a merchant banker, the Rule is not only applicable to a person who is managing the funds of its client. As the definition is rather vague and wide, we are of the opinion that there is a high likelihood that the services to be rendered by COMPANY 2 will attract the applicability of the Rule.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the transaction contemplated under the Agreement with COMPANY 2 concerns offshore entities, it will be prudent for STS to seek clarification from SEC.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have any further query, please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanking you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yours faithfully,</p>
