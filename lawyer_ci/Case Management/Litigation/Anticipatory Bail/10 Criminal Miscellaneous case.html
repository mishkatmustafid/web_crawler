<p style="text-align: justify;">07. That it is stated that the allegations as contained in the news items are totally false and misconceived and is in gross misrepresentation of the actual facts. The actual facts are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a) That at the request of Z Apparels (Pvt) Limited (the borrower Company) a Current Account being A/C No. 01009942 was opened with the Motijheel Branch of NCC Bank on 08.03.97. The borrower Company is a 100% export oriented Knit Garments Factory. It is registered with the Board of Investment. The borrower Company has obtained certificates from Export Promotion Bureau, national Board of Revenue, Bangladesh garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Textiles Department. The following persons were the Directors of the borrower Company:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a) Mr. A <b>: </b>Chairman</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">c) Mr. C <b>: </b>Director</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">d) Mr. D <b>:</b> Director</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b) That on 29.10.2000 Mr. B transferred his shares and resigned as Director of the borrower Company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">c) That from 18.11.99 to 09.04.2000 the borrower Company was granted back to back Letter of Credit facility on case to case basis for eight occasions. By availing the said facility the borrower Company opened letters of credit for an aggregate amount of US$ 18,19,939.31 only. In granting the facilities NOCs were obtained from the Bangladesh Bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">d) That subsequently, in consideration of the fact that the enterprise was an export-oriented body and it had shown reliable performance until that time, a memo was presented to the Board of Directors of the Bank and the following credit facilities were granted:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(i) Revolving B/B L/C to a limit of US$ 20,00,000.00</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(ii) Revolving PC for an amount of Tk. 1.25 crore</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(iii) FDBP limit for US$ 10,00,000.00</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">e) That the past record of the borrower Company shows that since borrower 1999 the borrower Company has opened back to Back letters of credit against Contract/Export L/Cs, imported raw materials, completed the order and made export of readymade garments. The liabilities of the borrower Company were being adjusted against export proceeds. Since 1999 the borrower Company has made exports of US$ 1,17,29,775.17 equivalent to Tk. 64,47,05,037.02 only out of which an amount of US$ 1,13,43,089.84 equivalent to Tk. 62,24,82,231.10 and an amount of US$ 3,86,685.33 equivalent to Tk. 2,22,22,805.92 only was not repatriated.

<p style="text-align: justify;">f) That in view of the past record of the borrower Company it is clear that NCC Bank had made transaction of Tk. 62,24,82,231.10 in equivalent foreign currency. Considering the past transaction it cannot be said that false transaction was made through a “bvg me©¯^ cÖwZôvb” as alleged in the case.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">08. That it is submitted that the letters of credit in question were opened upon the application of the borrower Company considering its past business transaction and the L/C liability was adjusted out of the export proceeds. In carrying on the business the borrower Company has got stuck up liability of Tk. 4,30,82,376.12 only as on 20.06.2002 with NCC Bank for which Money Suit No. 29 of 2002 was filed on 26.06.2002 in the Court of Joint District Judge and Artha Rin Adalat, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court at Dhaka for recovery of the said amount.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">09. That in such circumstances it cannot be said the petitioner has personally misappropriated Tk. 18,34,49,796.00 only through opening of false letters of credit. As such it is submitted that the police case as reported in the newspapers is false, fabricated and has been lodged with sole purpose of harassing the petitioner and maligning his good reputation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">10. That it is submitted that at the time of granting of any of the credit facilities as mentioned above the petitioner was not the Managing Director of NCC Bank. However, the loan was renewed and enhanced on 26.05.2001 after the inclusion of the petitioner in the Bank as the Managing Director. That was the first time when this account was brought to the attention of the petitioner. As Managing Director of NCC Bank the petitioner was not involved in the processing of the loan proposal of the borrower Company. The petitioner along with other loan proposals submitted the loan proposal of the borrower Company before the Board. It is mentioned here that in no uncertain terms that the name of Mr. Om Prakash Chowdhury or any of his concerned entities were not mentioned anywhere in the Board Memo that contained the proposal for renewal and enhancement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">11. That it is further submitted that the Board of Directors of NCC Bank had fullest confidence on the petitioner during his tenure of service of NCC Bank. There was no shred of doubt in the minds of the members of the Board that the petitioner was in no way connected in causing any financial loss to the Bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">12. That the petitioner apprehends that because of the wide publicity in the national dailies, if he surrenders before the Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka he shall not be enlarged on bail and be taken to custody.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">13. That it is submitted that for the reasons stated herein above this Court in exercise of its power under section 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure may grant anticipatory bail. This is a proper case where such discretion may be exercised by this Hon’ble Court.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wherefore, it is humbly prayed that your Lordships would graciously be pleased to:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(a) Issue Rule calling upon the opposite- party to show cause as to why the petitioner shall not be granted anticipatory bail in connection with the F. I. R. Nos. 17/102, 18/103, 19/104, 20/105, 21/106, 22/107 and 23/108 all dated 04.02.2003 lodged with Motijheel Police Station, Dhaka by Mr. Abdul Haque, Anti Corruption Officer against the petitioner and others under section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 and section 406, 409, 402, 467, 468, 471 and 109 of the Penal Code alleging misappropriation of Tk. 18,34,49,796.00 only by opening of letters of credit on account of Z Apparels (Pvt) Limited and after hearing the parties and cause shown, if any, make the Rule absolute;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(b) Pending hearing of the Rule enlarge the petitioner on anticipatory bail in connection with the F. I. R. Nos. 17/102, 18/103, 19/104, 20/105, 21/106, 22/107 and 23/108 all dated 04.02.2003 lodged with Motijheel Police Station, Dhaka; and/or</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(c) Pass such other order or as may deem fit and proper in this case.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And for this act of kindness, the petitioner, as in duty bound, shall ever pray.</p>
