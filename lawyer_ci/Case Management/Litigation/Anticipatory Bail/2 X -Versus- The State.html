<p style="text-align: justify;">08. That in such circumstances it cannot be said the petitioner has personally misappropriated Tk. 11.5 crore through opening of false letters of credit.

<p style="text-align: justify;">09. That it is further submitted that the Board of Directors of One Bank has fullest confidence on the petitioner. There is no shred of doubt in the minds of the members of the Board that the petitioner is in no way connected in causing any financial loss to the Bank. He is performing the duty as the Senior Assistant Vice President at the moment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">10. That the petitioner apprehends that because of the wide publicity in the national dailies, if he surrenders before the Metropolitan Magistrate or the Sessions Court, Dhaka he shall not be enlarged on bail and be taken to custody.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">11. That it is submitted that unless the petitioner is enlarged on bail and is taken to custody he will not be able to perform his official duties and as such the day to day business affairs of the Bank will be disrupted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">12. That it is further submitted that the petitioner is in the responsible position of Senior Assistant Vice President of a Bank. If the petitioner is enlarged on bail he will not abuse the bail or abscond.</p>
