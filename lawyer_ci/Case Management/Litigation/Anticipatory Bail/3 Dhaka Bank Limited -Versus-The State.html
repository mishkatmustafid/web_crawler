B. Apparels (Pvt) Limited.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">07. That it is stated that the allegations as contained in the news items are totally false and misconceived and is in gross misrepresentation of the actual facts. The factual position is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a) That at the request of H. B. Apparels (Pvt) Limited (the borrower Company) a Current Account was opened with the Dhaka Bank. The borrower Company is a 100% export oriented Knit Garments Factory. It is registered with the Board of Investment. The borrower Company has obtained certificates from Export Promotion Bureau, national Board of Revenue, Bangladesh garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Textiles Department. The following persons were the Directors of the borrower Company as per particulars submitted by the branch to Head Office:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a) Mr. G <b>: </b>Chairman</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b) Mr. H <b>: </b>Managing Director</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">c) Mr. J <b>: </b>Director</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">d) Mr. K <b>:</b> Director</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b) That on 29.10.2000 Mr. GK transferred his shares and resigned as Director of the borrower Company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">c) That subsequently at the request of the borrower Company Back to Back letters of credit facilities of US$ 4,00,000.00 was granted upon approval of the Board of Directors of Dahak Bank. The said facility was secured by 60% margin in the form of FDR at the time of opening the B/B L/C and also 40% in the form of FDR at the time of release of import documents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">d) That in addition to the earlier B/B L/C facility, the borrower Company once again approached Dhaka Bank and vide its letter dated 03.08.1999, asked for B/B L/C limit for an amount of US$ 3,50,000.00 only against contract or Export L/C.

The purpose of this particular B/B L/C was to import yarn/raw materials in order to produce 100% export oriented cotton fabrics. This time around, there was a margin of 25% in the form of FDR at the time of opening of the B/B L/C.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">e) That the borrower Company availed the L/C facilities in full and made use of the same in the running of its business. As time passed by, the borrower Company approached Dhaka Bank again with the request to enhance the B/B L/C limit vide its letter dated 11.12.2001. After much deliberation, Dhaka Bank finally approved the Proposal dated 11.12.1999 and enhanced the B/B L/C limit from US$ 3,50,000.00 only to US$ 7,00,000.00 only against the existing securities tendered for the earlier B/B L/Cs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">f) That notwithstanding the B/B L/C limits already being enjoyed, the borrower Company approached Dhaka Bank time and again in writing with the requests for further enhancement of the B/B L/C limit. The Bank considered the said requests and gradually enhanced the limit for the B/B L/C to US$ 11,00,000.00 only vide its proposal dated 23.02.2002 and from US$ 11,00,000.00 only to US$ 25,00,000.00 only vide its Proposal dated 30.05.2000 with prior clearance of Bangladesh Bank vide letter No. DBOD (Bri Rin)200/18-1949 dated 27.06.2000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">g) That vide its letter dated 01.03.2002, the borrower Company came forward once again with the request not only to enhance the existing B/B L/C limit, but also to sanction additional facilities in its favour. After evaluating the request in the form of a Proposal dated 11.03.2001, Dhaka Bank finally vide its Letter of Offer dated 12.04.2001 granted the following multiple credit facilities to the borrower Company with prior clearance of Bangladesh Bank vide letter No. DBOD (Bri Rin)200/18-2001-1171 dated 01.04.2001:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">c) Secured Overdraft for a limit of Tk. 1,00,00,000.00 (BDT one crore) only.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">h) That in order to secure the fresh facilities obtained, the borrower Company continued and created the following charges in favour of Dhaka Bank:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(a) Personal Guarantees of all the Directors already obtained.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(b) Third Party Personal Guarantee from Mr. KK.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(c) Lien of cash incentives against export receivables from Bangladesh Bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(d) Lien on FDR for Tk. 4,75,00,000.00 (BDT four crore and seventy five lac) only and more amount of FDR to be built up in the future.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">j) That in view of the past record of the borrower Company it is clear that Dhaka Bank had made exports of about Tk. 133.83 crores during the period from 1999 to 2002 and thus earned foreign currency for the country through the borrower Company and its sister concerns/associate companies. Dhaka Bank has earned an amount of Tk. 2.56 crores during the period from 1999 to 2002 through the borrower Company and its sister concerns/associate companies. Considering the past transaction it cannot be said that false transaction was made.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">08. That it is submitted that the letters of credit in question were opened upon the application of the borrower Company considering its past business transaction and the local L/C liability was adjusted out of the export proceeds. In carrying on the business the borrower Company has got stuck up liability of Tk. 62,78,908.26 only as on 21.08.2002 with Dhaka Bank for which Money Suit No. 36 of 2002 was filed on 24.08.2002 in the Court of Joint District Judge and Artha Rin Adalat, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court at Dhaka for recovery of the said amount. It may be mentioned here the borrower Company had an contingent liability of Tk. 17,30,37,155.44 only. Out of the said contingent liability an amount of Tk. 16,45,18,190.46 became absolute liability because of payment under the B/B L/C. Consequently, the suit value was increased to Tk. 17,07,97,098.66 only.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">09. That subsequent to the filing of the suit Dhaka Bank realised export proceeds and cash incentive from Bangladesh Bank and thus the liability of the borrower Company was reduced to Tk. 8,93,39,207.66 only as follows as on 02.03.2003:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">10. That in such circumstances it cannot be said the petitioner has personally misappropriated Tk. 24.94 crore through opening of false letters of credit.
