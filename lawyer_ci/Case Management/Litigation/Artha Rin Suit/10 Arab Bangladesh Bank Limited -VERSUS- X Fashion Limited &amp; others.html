<p style="text-align: justify;">The petitioner/Decree-holder most respectfully states as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1) That the decree-holder/petitioner has filed this Execution Case against the Judgment debtors/Opposite Parties on 13.06.2006 for recovery of decretal amount as per the terms of the decree passed by the Artha Rin Adalat No. 3, Dhaka.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2) That since the liability of the captioned judgment debtor has adjusted, the decree-holder/petitioner is no longer willing to proceed with the Execution Case and the Execution Case may be dismissed for non-prosecution. As such the decree-holder/petitioner is filing this application for necessary order from the learned Court.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wherefore, it is humbly prayed that your honour would be kind enough to allow the Execution Case of dismiss for non-prosecution and pass such necessary order and/or any other order or orders as the learned Court may deem fit and proper.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And for this act of kindness the decree-holder/petitioner as in duty bound shall ever pray.</p>
