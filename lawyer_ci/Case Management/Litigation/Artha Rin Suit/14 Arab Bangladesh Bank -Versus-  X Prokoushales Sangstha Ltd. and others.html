<p style="text-align: justify;">4. That the above situation the decree holder Bank is praying to the Court to pass an order infavour of the decree holder Bank directing to RAJUK to pay the award in respect of the Mortgaged property under section 36 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain 2003. Otherwise the judgement debtor will receive the money from RAJUK and the decree will be frustrated.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is, therefor, prayed that a order may pass by this Court upon the RAJUK to pay the said award amounting to Tk. 2,31,957.22 (Taka two lac thirty one thousand nine hundred fifty seven and paisa twenty two) to the decree-holder Bank, and/or pass such other order or orders as the learned Court may deem fit and proper.</p>
