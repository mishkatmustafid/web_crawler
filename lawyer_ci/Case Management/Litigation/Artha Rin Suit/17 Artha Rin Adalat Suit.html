<p style="text-align: justify;">The terms and conditions of the aforesaid Sanction Letters were duly accepted by the defendant No.1.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">05. That the Overdraft Facility and time to time enhancement was secured <i>inter alia</i> as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a) Mortgage of land measuring .0100 ojutangsha within District Dhaka, P.S. Lalbagh, J.L. No. C.S. 4, Mouza C.S. &amp; Petty -Sadar Dhaka S.A. Lalbag, C.S. &amp; S.A.

<p style="text-align: justify;">g) Execution of usual charge documents, namely. Promissory note, letter of continuity, letter of revival etc., all dated 13.11.1997.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That the defendant No.1 availed the above enhanced Overdraft facility in full. But the validities of the aforesaid enhanced facility expired leaving the entire amount unadjusted by the defendant No.1. Thereafter at the request of the defendant No.1, the plaintiff bank rescheduled the loan account of the defendant No.1 vide Sanction Letter No. IMG/LOAN/1229/2000 dated 02.08.2000 at Tk. 128.60 lac for full and final settlement against the then outstanding amount on condition inter alia that the defendant No.1 would adjust the settled amount by two phases, i.e. Tk. 60 lac within 30.09.2000 and the remaining amount of Tk. 68.60 lac within 31.03.2001. But, as the defendant No.1 failed to adjust the re-scheduled amount as promised, the re-scheduled arrangement stood cancelled.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That the defendant No. 1 availed the credit facility in full but failed to adjust its liabilities with the plaintiff bank within the validity. Despite repeated requests and reminders by the plaintiff bank through several letters including letters dated 07.10.2001, 29.12.2001, 06.01.2002, 20.04.2002, 26.07.2002, 19.04.2003, 10.11.2003, 28.03.2004, 19.04.2004, 21.04.2004, 20.10.2004, 04.12.2004, 11.12.2004 and 02.01.2005, the defendant No. 1 did not come forward to adjust its liabilities with the plaintiff bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That thereupon being completely displeased with the defendant No.1, the plaintiff bank on 25.01.2000, 17.05.2001, 05.03.2003 and 18.11.2004 cause served legal notice upon all the defendants requesting them to adjust the loan liability of the defendant No.1 immediate after the receipt of the notice. The defendant No.1 in all occasion ignoring the legal notices purposely failed to liquidate the liabilities with the plaintiff bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That in response to the aforesaid reminders and legal notices, the defendant No.1 however vide their letters dated 24.06.2001, 31.10.2001, 29.11.2001, 29.12.2001, 14.02.2000, 06.08.2002, 29.09.2002, 02.04.2003, 04.05.2003 and 30.11.2004, acknowledged his liability with the plaintiff bank and also expressed his willingness to adjust the entire liability within a short period but of no avail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That before filing of this suit the mortgaged and hypothecated properties could not be sold by the plaintiff Bank due to issuance of Rule by write Bench of the Honourable High Court Division of the Supreme Court in similar matters, wherein the provision of the section 12(3) of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, has been challenged.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That it is apparent from negative attitude of the defendant 1 along with other defendants that they have been evading liquidating the long outstanding dues of the defendant No.1 with the plaintiff bank. The plaintiff bank made repeated reminders to the defendant No. 1 to liquidate its liabilities with the plaintiff bank but the defendant No.1 continued to fail paying any attention to the plaintiff bank in this regard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That none of the defendants are serious at all with regard to adjust their outstanding liabilities with the plaintiff bank. It is evident from the conduct of the defendants that they have no intention to make repayment of their entire outstanding liabilities lying with the plaintiff bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That the plaintiff bank gave the defendants ample time and opportunity to clear the outstanding liabilities of the defendant No. 1 but the defendants are reluctant in this regard. It is abundantly clear that the defendants would not adjust the plaintiff bank’s dues unless compelled by law. The plaintiff bank cannot wait for an indefinite period for the defendants to adjust the outstanding liabilities of the defendant No. 1 lying with the plaintiff bank. The defendants are wilfully resorting to delaying tactics to avoid repayment of the long outstanding dues. Having no alternative the plaintiff bank is compelled to file this suit against the defendants to realize its legitimate dues. The plaintiff bank states that the defendants are severally and jointly liable to repay the outstanding dues of the defendant No.1 lying with the plaintiff bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That the outstanding liability of the defendants is of Tk. 2,56,74,454.23 (Taka two crore fifty six lac seventy four thousand four hundred fifty four and Paisa twenty three) only as on 31.12.2004 as follows, which the defendants are jointly and/or severally legally liable to pay:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That the cause of action to file this suit arose on 08.04.86, when the plaintiff bank the defendant No. 1 opened account with the plaintiff Bank, on 24.12.94, when the Plaintiff Bank sanctioned various credit facilities, on 05.12.95, 18.12.96, 13.11.1997 and 02.08.2000 when the credit facility was renewed and enhanced, on 12.01.1995, 13.05.1996, 18.12.1996, and 21.04.1998 when the defendant Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and Late Mr. Q s mortgaged their property on 1311.1997 when the defendant No. 1 hypothecated his assets with the plaintiff bank, on 13.11.1997 when the defendant Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and Late Mr. Q executed personal guarantees, on 13.11.1997 when the defendant No. 1 executed various charge documents, on various dates including 07.10.2001, 29.12.2001, 06.01.2002, 20.04.2002, 26.07.2002, 19.04.2003, 10.11.2003, 28.03.2004, 19.04.2004, 21.04.2004, 20.10.2004, 04.12.2004, 11.12.2004 and 02.01.2005, when the plaintiff Bank requested the defendant No. 1 to adjust the liabilities, on 25.01.2000, 17.05.2001, 05.03.2003 and 18.11.2004 when the legal notices were served by the plaintiff, on 24.06.2001, 31.10.2001, 29.11.2001, 29.12.2001, 14.02.2000, 06.08.2002, 29.09.2002, 02.04.2003, 04.05.2003 and 30.11.2004, when the defendant No. 1 acknowledged his liability with the plaintiff bank and the said cause of action is continuing till date.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thatthe suit is for realisation of a decree for a sum of 2,56,74,454.23 (Taka two crore fifty six lac seventy four thousand four hundred fifty four and Paisa twenty three) only as on 31.12.2004of a commercial bank and the said suit is within the jurisdiction of this Court. For the purpose of court fees, the plaintiff bank values the suit at the said amount and pays the ad-valorem court fees on the said amount.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That the Authorised Representative of the plaintiff bank in the instant suit is Mr. K, Senior Officer of the plaintiff bank who is well conversant with the facts of the case and shall be liable to testify on behalf of the plaintiff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The plaintiff bank, therefore, prays for:</p>
