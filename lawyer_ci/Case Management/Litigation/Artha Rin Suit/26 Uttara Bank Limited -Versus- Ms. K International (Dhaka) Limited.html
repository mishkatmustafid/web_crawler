<p style="text-align: justify;">05. That the said Back to Back L/Cs facility were sanctioned against the following securities:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a) Execution of charge documents, namely Demand Promissory Note, Letters of Authority, Letter of Continuity, Revival Letter etc by the defendant No.1.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b) Execution of a corporate guarantee by the defendant No.4.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">c) Execution of personal guarantees by the defendant Nos. 2 &amp; 3.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">d) Creation of first charge on the assets and book debts (both existing and future) of the defendant No.1.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">06. That the Back to Back L/Cs under this plaint were subject to Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (ICC Publication No. 500) [hereinafter referred to as UCPDC]. The beneficiaries of the aforesaid Back to Back L/Cs and the Letter of Credit shipped/supplied the goods and submitted the shipping documents to their respective Bank who in turn sent the said shipping documents to the plaintiff bank for acceptance and payment within due date.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">07. That the plaintiff bank received the shipping documents in terms of the Back to Back L/Cs and intimated the same to the defendant No.1. The defendant No.1 thereupon accepted the shipping documents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">08. That notwithstanding the acceptance of the documents as aforesaid and taking delivery of the raw materials under the said Back to Back L/Cs, the defendant No.1 did not execute the export orders effectively. In some cases shipments were not made in time, some times there were short shipments. In other cases though goods were shipped, the defendant No. 1 tendered discrepant documents which resulted in rejection of those documents. These resulted in non-repatriation of the export proceeds. The plaintiff bank submits that the liability of such non-execution of the Export Order is solely attributable to the deliberate/negligent failure of the defendant No.1.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">09. That as per norms and practice, it was the responsibility of the defendant No.1 to settle the Back to Back L/Cs payment on or before the due dates of the respective L/C from the export proceeds or from the defendant No.1’s own source. The defendant No.1 failed to act upon as per the said norms by failing to adjust the liabilities with the plaintiff bank within the maturity date. In the circumstances, full payment under the above Back to Back L/Cs could not be made out. The plaintiff bank on various occasions requested the defendant No.1 to arrange payment under all the Back to Back L/Cs but to no effect. Consequently, upon being found the documents in order, the plaintiff bank under a compelling situation had to effect payment under the Back to Back L/Cs by creating demand loan. The details of the demand loan that the plaintiff bank was compelled to create are as follows:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">That in another deal, at the request of the defendant No.1, the plaintiff bank also opened 2(two) L/Cs, being Nos. __________________for US$ 1,49,305.77 and ______________________jpy 2,43,91,009.00 on 180 days deferred payment basis for import of capital machinery from Japan. As security of the facilities defendant No1 mortgaged 83.75 decimals of land situated under mouza Purba Narshinghapar, P.S. Savar, Dhaka in favour of the plaintiff bank vide execution of ‘Deed of Equitable Mortgage’ and ‘Memorandum of Deposit of Title Deed’. The L/C for jpy 2,43,91,009.00 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Letter of Credit’ matured for payment on 03.06.2003.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That consequent upon failure of the defendant No.1 in making payment against the aforesaid L/C No. ______________ on maturity, the plaintiff bank under a compelling situation had to effect the payment of the L/C by creating demand loan of Tk.___________________ .</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That in another deal the plaintiff bank at the request of the defendant No.1 established another Back to Back L/C being No. 046502060064, dated 06.07.2002 for US$4,983.20. The beneficiary of this L/C shipped the goods under this L/C and sent the documents for acceptance by the defendant. The defendant No. 1 accepted the documents but did not release the documents from the plaintiff bank. In the situation, the plaintiff bank is liable to effect payment under this L/C within a short period and thereby upon payment of such amount reserves the right to add the paid amount to the suit value by way of amendment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">10. That the defendant No.1 thereafter failed to adjust the above demand loan. Despite repeated requests and reminders vide letters dated 28.03.2002, 29.04.2002, 19.02.2003 by the plaintiff bank, the defendant No.1 miserably failed to adjust the aforesaid liabilities with the plaintiff bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">11. That despite repeated requests and reminders, the defendant have not come forward to adjust the liabilities with the plaintiff bank.in response to the reminders of the plaintiff bank, the defendant No.1 by its letters dated 06.11.2003 acknowledged the liability and requested the plaintiff bank to allow the defendant to sell capital machinery which is hypothecated in favour of the plaintiff bank, wherein the defendant No.1 committed to adjust the outstanding liabilities within a short period, but to no effect. In this situation the defendants are trying to sell capital machinery without the consent of the plaintiff bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">12. That the plaintiff bank has been persistently insisting the defendant Nos. 1 to make adjustment of the liabilities. The endeavour to avoid the liability by the defendant No.1 was clearly in contravention to the respective Sanction Advice issued by the plaintiff bank. The plaintiff bank being completely displeased with the defendant No.1, cause served Legal Notice dated 06.12.2003 through its lawyer upon the defendants requesting them for adjustment of their liabilities with the plaintiff bank, with a note that the legal proceedings would be initiated against them if they fail to adjust their liabilities with the plaintiff bank within 3 (three) days of the receipt of the notice. None of the defendants either deposited any amount of the outstanding liability nor took any concrete steps for adjustment of their loan liabilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">13. That it is apparent from negative attitude of the defendant 1 along with other defendants that they have been evading liquidating the long outstanding dues of the defendant No.1 with the plaintiff bank in breach of their obligations under the terms and conditions of the UCPDC. The plaintiff bank made repeated reminders to the defendant No. 1 to liquidate his liabilities with the plaintiff bank but the defendant No.1 continued to fail paying any attention to the plaintiff bank in this regard. Despite repeated requests and reminders issued to the defendant No. 1 by the plaintiff bank to adjust their outstanding liabilities, none of the defendants came forward to adjust the over dues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">14. That none of the defendants are serious at all with regard to adjust their outstanding liabilities with the plaintiff bank. It is evident from the conduct of the defendants that they have no intention to make repayment of their entire outstanding liabilities lying with the plaintiff bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">15. That the plaintiff bank gave the defendants ample time and opportunity to clear the outstanding liabilities of the defendant No. 1 but the defendants are reluctant in this regard. It is abundantly clear that the defendants would not adjust the plaintiff bank’s dues unless compelled by law. The plaintiff bank cannot wait for an indefinite period for the defendants to adjust the outstanding liabilities of the defendant No. 1 lying with the plaintiff bank. The defendants are wilfully resorting to delaying tactics to avoid repayment of the long outstanding dues. Having no alternative the plaintiff bank is compelled to file this suit against the defendants to realize its legitimate dues. The plaintiff bank states that the defendants are severally and jointly liable to repay the outstanding dues of the defendant No.1 lying with the plaintiff bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">16. That the plaintiff bank submits that it cannot recover its dues amicably. The plaintiff bank endeavoured all its efforts to recover its dues from the defendants but to no effect. The defendants made no effort to adjust their liability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">17. That the outstanding liability of the defendants is of Tk.3,87,52,797.75 (Taka three crore eighty seven lac fifty two thousand seven hundred ninety seven and seventy four paisa) only inclusive of interest and charges as on 31.12.2003, and the interest to be charged thereon, which the defendants are jointly and severally legally liable to pay.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">18. That the cause of action of the suit arose in all the dates when the Back to Back and deferred payment L/Cs were opened, on all the dates when the plaintiff received the shipping documents of the L/Cs under this plaint, on all the dates when the L/Cs were accepted by the defendants No.1, on all the dates when the plaintiff created demand loan against the payment of the L/Cs, on all the dates including 04.09.2003 when the plaintiff requested the defendant No.1 to adjust the outstanding liabilities, on 06.11.2003 when the defendant No.1 acknowledged their liabilities, on 06.12.2003 when legal notice was issued upon the defendants requesting the defendants to adjust the outstanding liabilities and on each and every date when the defendants continued to default in repaying their outstanding liabilities with the plaintiff bank and the said cause of action is continuing till date.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">19. Thatthe suit is for realisation of a decree for a sum of Tk. Tk.3,87,52,797.75 (Taka three crore eighty seven lac fifty two thousand seven hundred ninety seven and seventy four paisa) only inclusive of interest and charges as on 31.12. 2003 of a commercial bank and the said suit is within the jurisdiction of this Court. For the purpose of court fees, the plaintiff bank values the suit at the said amount and pays the highest court fees on the said amount.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">20. That the Authorised Representative of the plaintiff bank in the instant suit is Mr._______________________ Senior Principal Officer of the plaintiff bank who is well conversant with the facts of the case and shall be liable to testify on behalf of the plaintiff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The plaintiff bank, therefore, prays for:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(a) A decree for a sum of Tk. Tk.3,87,52,797.75 (Taka three crore eighty seven lac fifty two thousand seven hundred ninety seven and seventy four paisa) only inclusive of interest and charges as on 31.12. 2003 in favour of the plaintiff bank and against the defendants jointly and/or severally;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(b) A Preliminary Decree for sale of the mortgaged property as described in the schedule below directing the defendants jointly and severally to pay the said amount by a particular date and on their failure, pass a final decree for the sale of mortgaged properties;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(c) A decree for the pendente-lite interest at the rate stipulated in the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 from the date of filing till the date of decree and from the date of decree till realisation of the decretal amount;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(d) A personal decree against the defendant Nos. 2 &amp; 3;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(e) A decree for the entire costs of the Suit;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(f) Any other relief(s) to which the plaintiff bank is entitled in law and equity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And for this act of kindness, the plaintiff bank as in duty bound shall ever pray.</p>
