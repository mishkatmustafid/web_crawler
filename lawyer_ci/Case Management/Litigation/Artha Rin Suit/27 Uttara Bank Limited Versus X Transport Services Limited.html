That the defendant No. 1 availed the above mentioned credit facilities in full failed to adjust its loan account within the validity according to the sanction letters.

<p style="text-align: justify;">7. That the defendants of the Artha Rin Suit No. 34 entered into an arrangement with the plaintiff to pay the outstanding amount in instalments. In this regard a joint application for compromise dated 17.08.04 (the Compromise Agreement) was filed in the Artha Rin Suit No. 34/2004 envisaging the repayment schedule to obtain sole-decree. Upon hearing of the application, the learned Judge of 2<sup>nd</sup> Artha Artha Rin Adalat, Dhaka passed order No. 116 dated 04.09.2004 stating that the Artha Rin Suit No. 34/2004 is sole-decreed with the defendants and the Compromise Agreement will be the part of the decree. Accordingly the Preliminary Decree was passed on 11.09.04.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">12.

<p style="text-align: justify;">14. That the plaintiff bank gave the defendants ample time and opportunity to adjust the outstanding liabilities with the plaintiff bank but the defendants are reluctant in this regard. It is abundantly clear that the defendants would not adjust the plaintiff bank’s dues unless compelled by law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">15. That the plaintiff bank cannot wait for an indefinite period for the defendants to recover its legitimate dues. Having no other alternative the plaintiff bank is compelled to file this suit against the defendants to realize its legitimate dues.</p>
