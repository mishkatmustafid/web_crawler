Further it is submitted that at the request of the defendant/opposite party No. 1, defendant/opposite party No.2 from time to time opened a series of Back to Back L/Cs in favour of the defendant/opposite No. 1 for procurement of raw materials.

Thereafter having no alternative the defendant/opposite party No.2 is compelled to file Artha Rin Suit No. 36 of 2004 against the defendant/opposite No. 1 and others on 08.03.2004 to realize its legitimate dues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7. That the statements made in paragraph No. 2(h) of the application filed by the plaintiffs are false, fabricated, concocted, misconceived and hence strongly denied by the defendant No. 2.

<p style="text-align: justify;">11. That it is also submitted that the plaintiffs has miserably failed to establish any prima facie case and as such they are not legally entitled to any injunction whatsoever.</p>
