<p style="text-align: justify;">The petitioner/Decree-holder most respectfully states as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1) That the Decree-Holder/Petitioner has filed this Execution Case against the Judgment debtors/Opposite Parties on 13.06.2006 for recovery of decretal amount and other cost of Tk. 2,46,10,913.71.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2) That after filing this Execution Case the Judgment Debtors came forward for settling the matter out of the Court and offered to repay their dues with the Decree-holder Bank. However as per the compromised arrangement the Judgment Debtors has already adjusted their liability with the Decree-holder Bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3) In the above circumstances the Decree-holder/Petitioner is no longer willing to proceed with the Execution Case and the Execution Case may be dismissed for non-prosecution. And as such the Decree-holder/Petitioner is filing this application for necessary order from the learned Court.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wherefore, it is humbly prayed that your honour would be kind enough to allow the Execution Case of dismiss for non-prosecution and pass such necessary order and/or any other order or orders as the learned Court may deem fit and proper.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And for this act of kindness the Decree-holder/Petitioner as in duty bound shall ever pray.</p>
