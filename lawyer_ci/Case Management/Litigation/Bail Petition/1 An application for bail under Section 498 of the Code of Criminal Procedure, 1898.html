<p style="text-align: justify;">The humble petition of the Accused -petitioner above named most respectfully –</p>

That the prosecution alleging <i>inter alia </i>that the victim M of 22 years was the student of Chemistry (1<sup>st</sup> year Honours) in the Narsingdi Government College. On 12.03.08 at about 5 pm he left home for Chalakchar bazar for the purpose of purchasing selu machine parts. At about 8.30 pm while the informant was at his home, 2 unknown boys ran towards the informant’s home and informed that the victim was killed and he was in the Angor’s house. The informant ran towards Angor’s home and saw the victim was laying at the Angor’s yard and he was seriously bleeding. The informant found 3 stabs in the throat and 1 stab in the palm. The eye witness Angor said that he was inside home at about 8 pm. and the victim fell at his yard with shouting and he came out of his home and saw the victim</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Certified copy of the Ejhar and F.I.R. are annexed herewith and marked as <b>Annexure-“A”</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. That the accused-petitioner contends, <i>inter alia</i>, that he is not aware of the alleged offence. He had no connection with the alleged offence. At the time of the alleged offence he was at his sister’s home at Madabdi, Narsingdi, about 30 kilo meters away from the alleged place of offence. No body raised any allegation against the petitioner except the accused No. 5, Mustafa who tried to falsely incriminate the petitioner out of his enmity with the petitioner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5. That upon conclusion of the investigation, the investigation officer submitted the charge sheet being No. 176 dated 25.12.08 under sections 302 and 34 of the Penal Code against the accused-petitioner most illegally and others and the learned Senior Judicial Magistrate, Narsingdi, sent the record to the learned Session Judge Court, Narsingdi for trial. The Charge sheet against the petitioner is not supported by the statements u/s 161.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certified copies of the charge sheet is annexed herewith and marked as <b>Annexure-“B”</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6. That on 12.04.08 the Accused-Petitioner was arrested by the police and forwarded him before the learned Senior Judicial Magistrate, Monohordi, Narsingdi and the accused-petitioner was sent to the custody.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7. That on 17.03.09 it was fixed for charge hearing and the learned Session Judge framed the charge against the accused-petitioner with other accused and fixed the next date on 13.05.2009 for deposition of prosecution witnesses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certified copies of the relevant order is annexed herewith and marked as <b>Annexure-“C”</b></p>
<ol start="8" style="text-align: justify;" type="1">
<li>That on 17.03.09, the accused-petitioner filed a bail application before the Court below for granting him bail and the application was rejected by the learned Session Judge, Narsingdi without assigning any lawful and valid reason. The learned Judge himself surprisingly invented a factual ground to reject the bail application which does not have any basis. It was not mentioned in the J statement u/s 164 that “<i>confessing accused J has implicated this accused with the allegation”</i>. The learned Court below wrongfully rejected the bail application of the accused-petitioner upon assuming a fact which neither stated in confessing statement of J nor statement u/s 161 nor in the charge sheet. Although the F.I.R. and the statements of J u/s 164 does not disclose the Accused-petitioner’s name but the learned Court below wrongfully rejected the bail application of the Accused -petitioner upon assuming a fact.</li>
</ol>

</ol>

<p style="text-align: justify;">11. That it is humbly stated that the accused-petitioner has been languishing in the jail-custody since he was arrested on 12.04.2008.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">12. That it is humbly submitted that the accused-petitioner has been falsely implicated in the instant Case.

<p style="text-align: justify;">13. That it is humbly submitted that the F.I.R. does not disclose the petitioner’s name. Even charge sheet does not disclose the alleged offence against the petitioner.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">IV. For that the learned Court below failed to take into consideration that FIR does not disclose accused-petitioner’s name and as such the accused-petitioner is entitled to be enlarged on bail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">V. For that the no specific allegation is alleged against the accused-petitioner in the charge sheet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">VI. For that the confessing accused Mustafa tried to falsely implicate the petitioner in the alleged offence just out of enmity and as such the accused-petitioner is entitled to be enlarged on bail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">VII. For that other confessing accused, principal accused, J and Accused No. 2, Dental Y did not mention the petitioner’s name and as such, the petitioner is entitled to be enlarged on bail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">VIII. The accused-petitioner has been apprehended without any material information regarding the accused-petitioner’s involvement with the alleged offence and thus the accused-petitioner has been made the victim of the circumstances and as such the accused-petitioner is entitled to be enlarged on bail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">IX. For that the accused-petitioner who has been languishing in jail custody for a period of more than 1 (one) year for no reason and as such the accused-petitioner is entitled to be enlarged on bail.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">XIII. For that the learned Court below wrongfully rejected the bail application of the accused-petitioner upon assuming a fact and as such the accused-petitioner is entitled to be enlarged on bail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">XIV. For that the accused-petitioner has been falsely implicated in this case and he is not at all involved with the alleged offence or with any activity linked to the alleged offence whatsoever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">XV. For that the accused-petitioner is a law abiding citizen of Bangladesh. He and hence, there is no chance for him to abscond if he is enlarged on bail. The accused-petitioner is ready to comply with any condition imposed by your Lordships.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wherefore, it is humbly prayed that your Lordships would graciously be pleased to issue a Rule calling upon the Opposite Party to show cause as to why the accused-petitioner should not be enlarged on bail in Session Case No. 47/09 corresponding to Monohordi Thana Police Station Case No. 08 dated 12.03.2008 arising out of G.R. Case No. 131/08 under section 302 and 34 of the Penal Code now pending before the Session Court, Narsingdi and upon hearing both the parties, perusing the cause shown, if any, make the Rule absolute and pass such other or further order or orders as to your lordships may deem fit and proper.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AND</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pending hearing of the Rule, the accused-petitioner may be enlarged on ad-interim bail in the instant case.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And for this act of kindness the Accused -petitioner as in duty bound shall ever pray.</p>
