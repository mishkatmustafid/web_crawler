<p style="text-align: justify;">7. That in the stated circumstances, the Complainant got puzzled and requested the Accused Nos. 1 and 2 to give back the money.

<p style="text-align: justify;">11. That the Accused Nos. 1-3 with a common intention to defraud the Complainant delivered fake visa to the Complainant and collusively in connivance with each other and are not giving back the money to the Complainant and took benefit from thereon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">12. That the Accused Nos. 1-3 neither giving back the Complainant’s entitled money despite repeated request from the Complainant and thereby practiced shrewd fraud, criminal breach of trust upon the Complainant and committed a heinous crime.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">13. That it is apparent from the entire transaction and subsequent activities of the Accused Nos. 1-3 that they have committed criminal breach of trust, cheating with the Complainant with the intention that they will not pay back the money and thereby caused huge financial loss to the Complainant. The Complainant is now helpless and facing serious hardship because of the fraudulent acts of the Accused. The Accused have committed offences under section 34, 406, 417, 420 of the Penal Code, 1860 and are liable to be punished.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">14. That in view of the facts and circumstances stated above, the accused should be brought to justice as provided under section 34, 406, 417, 420 of the Penal Code, 1860.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wherefore, it is humbly prayed that the Learned Court may graciously be pleased to take cognizance of the offence, issue warrant of arrest against the Accused and bring them to justice for the offence committed by them, and/or pass such other or further order or orders as the learned Court may deem fit and proper.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And for this act of kindness the complainant as in duty bound shall ever pray.</p>
