That the petitioner came to know that Mr. X Bhuiyan as appellant being aggrieved and dissatisfied by the order of Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka dated 31.07.2002 in the Misc. Appeal No. 62 of 2000 has filed the above mentioned appeal against the respondents. This petitioner Bank has not been made party in this appeal.</p>

The appellant – Mr. X Bhuiyan and two others are Directors of Bengal Trade &amp; Tourism Limited, which is a private limited company and availed various lone facilities from the petitioner Bank. The appellant and the said two other Directors stood guarantors and executed personal guarantees in favor of the petitioner Bank against the loan availed by Bengal Trade &amp; Tourism Limited. As security of the loan the appellant mortgaged the Schedule Property with this petitioner Bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. That since Bengal Trade &amp; Tourism Limited failed to adjust the liabilities with the Bank, Title Suit No. 75 of 1998 was filed in the Court of Subordinate Judge and 3<sup>rd</sup> Artha Rin Adalat, Dhaka against Bengal Trade &amp; Tourism Limited and four others, including the appellant – Mr. X Bhuiyan for realization of money by sale of the Scheduled Property being the mortgaged properties.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">5. That in the premises the petitioner Bank being the decree-holder for foreclosure of the Scheduled Property is a necessary party for proper and judicious disposal of the instant appeal. As such the petitioner Bank needs to be added as a party to the instant appeal. Accordingly it is prayed that the petitioner Bank be added as a party for complete and proper adjudication of the appeal, otherwise this petitioner shall suffer irreparable loss and thus the justice would be denied.</p>
