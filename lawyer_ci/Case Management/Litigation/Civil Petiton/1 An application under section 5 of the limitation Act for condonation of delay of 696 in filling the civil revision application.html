<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>SHEWETH:</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">01.

<p style="text-align: justify;">02. That it is started that there is no prescribed period of limitation in the code of civil procedure or in the limitation Act, 1908 for filling revision but as a long standing practice before this Hon’ble Court 90 days limitation for filling Civil Revision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">07. That plaintiffs/opposite parties has filed Title Suit No. 106 of 2003 on 18.05.2003 in the Court of Joint District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Dhaka against this petitioner and others praying for the reliefs <i>inter alia </i>declaration that the mortgage deed described in the B schedule of the plaint is forged, fabricated, illegal and void.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">08. That the defendant No. 9/petitioner appeared in Title Suit No. 106 of 2003 through its lawyer and subsequently when the suit came at the hearing stage, the defendant No.9/petitioner on 27.07.2004 filed an application under Order XIV, Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 for framing of the legal issue, i.e., whether the suit is barred by section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">09. That the learned Court upon hearing of the application vide Order No. 30 dated 27.07.2004 re-framed all the issues and fixed the next date of the suit for further hearing on 17.08.2004.</p>

That thereafter the defendant No.9/petitioner on 17.08.2004 submitted an application for adjournment praying that the suggested legal issue of the defendant No.9/petitioner should be tried and disposed of first postponing the factual issues and for adjournment/postponement of further hearing of the suit until disposal of the suggested legal issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">11. That the learned Court heard the application for adjournment on 12.09.2004, but did not pass any order on that date. Subsequently, on 30.09.2004 the learned Court vide Order No. 35 disallowed the application of the defendant No.9/petitioner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">12. That it may be mentioned here that the petitioner filed Civil Revision No. 528 of 2004 in the learned District Judge Court, Dhaka against Order No. 35 dated 30.09.2004 passed by Mr. Md. Golam Kibria, Joint District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Dhaka in Title Suit No. 106 of 2003 disallowing the application under Order XIV Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 filed by the defendant No.9/ petitioner for framing of legal issue. After hearing, the learned District Judge Court, Dhaka admitted the Civil Revision and thereafter granted order of stay of further proceedings of Title Suit No. 106 of 2003.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">13. That it is stated that subsequently the learned Court below vide order No. 12 dated 15.06.2006 directed to return the petition of the Civil Revision to the petitioner with observation that as per judgement passed in Civil Revision No. 1701 of 2005 reported in 58 DLR, page 211, the Court below has no jurisdiction to try the Civil Revision No. 528 of 2004. Subsequently, on 06.07.2006 the learned Court below returned the petition of Civil Revision No. 528 of 2004 along with papers/documents to the petitioner. In fact only 79 (seventy nine) days has been passed from the date when the learned Court below returned the petition and papers/documents to the petitioner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">14. That it is submitted that the delay of filing this revisional application was occurred because of filing Civil Revision No. 528 of 2004 in the Court of District Judge, Dhaka by the petitioner which was subsequently returned by the learned Court District Judge Court, Dhaka for lack of jurisdiction. As such the delay was unintentional and inadvertent on the part of the petitioner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">15. That it is submitted that there is no leaches or negligence on the part of the petitioner in filling the revisional application. That the delay in filling the revisional application is totally unintentional and beyond the control of the petitioner and as such the delay in filling the revisional application may kindly be condoned otherwise the petitioner will be highly prejudiced.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">16. That the petition is filed bona-fide.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wherefore, it is most humbly prayed that your Lordships may graciously be pleased to issue a Rule calling upon the opposite parties to show cause as to why the delay of 696 days should not be condone in filling the revisional application and/or pass such other or further order or orders as to your Lordship may deem fit and proper for ends of justice in the case.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And for this act of kindness the defendant/petitioner as in duty bound will ever pray.</p>
