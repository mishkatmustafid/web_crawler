<p>d) In the 4<sup>th</sup> line from the bottom of paragraph 21 of the plaint the phrase “The defendants/debtors No.2-7 &amp; 10 are liable to pay as directors” needs to be deleted.</p>
<p>06. That the amendments mentioned above are essential for proper and final adjudication of the suit and for complete dispensation of justice.</p>
<p>07. That this application has been filed <i>bonafide</i>.</p>
<p>Wherefore it is humbly prayed that Your Honour would graciously be pleased to allow the application for amendment of the plaint as proposed above and/or pass such other or further order(s) as may deem fit and proper.</p>
