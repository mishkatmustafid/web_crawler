<p style="text-align: justify;">To</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Justice M M Ruhul Amin, the Chief Justice of Bangladesh and his companion justices of the said Hon’ble Court.</p>

He has been his business with reputation in Tokyo for a decade. In last few years the accused appellant contributed to Bangladesh national economy by sending more than taka 2.0 crore (taka two crore) as remittance from Japan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Copies of the receipts of remittance issued from Japan are annexed herewith and marked as ANNEXURE-“A”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">04. That in the late afternoon of 15.05.2008, immediately after his arrival in Bangladesh from Japan the accused-appellant came to know from his relatives that on 12.02.2008 a complaint being the Nari-O-Shishu Case No. 82/2008 dated 12.02.2008 under sections 11(Ga) and 30 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Domon Ain, 2000 (as amended in 2003), now pending in the Court of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Domon Special Tribunal, Narsingdi (hereinafter referred to as the Complaint) was filed against the accused-appellant as accused No. 1 along with 2 (two) other accused.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">05. That thereafter, accused-appellant filed a Criminal Misc. Case No. 7738 of 2008 in the High Court Division of Bangladesh. A Division Bench of the High Court Division comprising of Mr. Justice Nazrul Islam Chowdhury and Mr. Justice Md. Ataur Rahman Khan graciously pleased to enlarge the accused appellant ad-interim anticipatory bail for a period of two months vide order dated 27.05.2008.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">06. That the complainant-respondent alleged in the Complaint <i>inter alia</i> that the accused-appellant demanded taka 5, 00,000.00 (taka five lac) on the day before the alleged offence took place. Upon refusal to pay such an amount, on 09.11.2006 the accused-appellant took the complainant-respondent to her father’s house and demanded taka 5,00,000.00 (taka five lac) as dowry in front of her guardian. Upon expressing their inability to pay the accused-appellant battered in the face of the complainant-respondent, other accused hurt in different parts of the body and pulled her by hair.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certified copy of the complaint is annexed herewith and marked as ANNEXURE- “B”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">07. That the learned judge being received the complaint from the complainant-respondent ordered the local ward commissioner of the complainant-respondent, Mr. Azizur Rahman (Akter) to investigate the complaint and to submit the report within 7 (seven) days from the date of the receipt of the notice. The said commissioner investigated the matter and on 18.03.2008 submitted the report in the learned court.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certified copy of the ward commissioner report is annexed herewith and marked as ANNEXURE-“C”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">08. That being receipt and heard of the report the learned judge took the cognizance of alleged offence against the accused-appellant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certified copy of the relevant order is annexed herewith and marked as ANNEXURE-“D”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">09. That the Complaint is full of false, vague and frivolous stories made only to harass and humiliate the accused-appellant. This is indeed a strange repercussion of the break up of their relationship through divorce. In fact there was no other alternative for the accused appellant but to divorce thecomplainant- respondent due to her immoral lifestyle and other reasons stated below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">10. That on 20.04.2003 the accused-appellant married thecomplainant- respondent observing the principles of Islamic Shari’ah. Since the very first week of the wedlock, the accused-appellant has found her morally weak, rude in behaviour and imbalanced in lifestyle. He tried his best to rebuild her character in very many ways but failed at the end. The accused-appellant took the complainant-respondent twice to Japan so that she could correct herself. Apart from this the accused-appellant visited Bangladesh about 16 times in last 4 years to prevent her from mixing with her so-called boy friends. During one visit in Japan, the complainant-respondent attempted to kill the accused-appellant by sharp kitchen knife immediately after the accused-appellant disagreed to purchase all luxury items she chose from the shopping centre for her parents. This event made the accused-appellant realized that the complainant-respondent could not be his life time partner rather she would be a danger.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">11. That on 08.11.2007, 24 hours before the date of the alleged occurrence, the complainant-respondent threatened the accused-appellant to the effect that she would not keep marital relationship with him if his parents and other relatives lived at his Sylhet residence. She kept saying that she would not stay with the relatives of the accused-appellant. On 09.11.2007 and the following day i.e. on 10.11.2007 the accused-petitioner was at his Sylhet residence. On 11.11.2007 the accused appellant took the complainant-respondent to her father’s residence and permitted to stay there. Therefore the allegation made in the Complaint that ‘AvmvgxMY NUbvi c~‡e©i w`b evw`bxi wbKU Zvnv‡`i evox‡Z 5,00,000.00 (cuvP j¶) UvKv †hŠZzK `vex Kwi‡j evw`bx AcviMZv cÖKvk Kivq ci w`b A_©vr 09.11.2007 Bs ZvwiL mKvj 10.00 NwUKvq evw`bx‡K Zvnvi wcÎvj‡q wbqv Av‡m… Õ is false and fabricated, made out only to mislead the court.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">12. That the statement of the complaint, “The accused-appellant demanded the dowry of taka 5,00,000.00 (taka five lac) on the day before of the alleged offence at the residence of the accused in Sylhet and being refused by the complainant-respondent, the accused-appellant brought complainant-respondent to her father’s home at Narsingdi and demanded the alleged dowry in front of her parents at 10.00 a.m.” is false, fabricated, concocted and does not contain any ingredient of the alleged offence because of the absurdity. It is submitted that the 1<sup>st</sup> bus leaves the Sylhet inter city bus terminal at 7.00 am in the morning. The distance between residence of the accused appellant and the complainant-respondent is 250 kilo meters. Even if the bus runs @ 70 kilo meters/ph it requires 3.50 hours to reach Narsingdi. In that case, approximate arrival time at complainant-respondent’s residence would be at 10.30 a.m. and @ 60 kilo metres/ph speed of the bus, the arrival time would be 11 a.m. Therefore, the statement revealed in the complaint itself that the accused-appellant took the complainant-respondent on the date of alleged offence and demanded the dowry at 10.00 am is absurd, false, fabricated, made out only to mislead the court.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">13. That on 12.11.2007 the accused-appellant left Bangladesh for Japan. It was discovered later on that the complainant-respondent took away with her all the valuable belongings, expensive jewelries, digital camera and USD $ 25,000.00 (twenty five thousand US dollars) in cash without the knowledge and permission of the accused-petitioner and/or other relatives. The accused-appellant’s brother-in-law, Mr. Shahjahan Ahmed filed a General Diary in the Kotwali Thana, Sylhet vide GD No. 1438 dated 19.11.2007 following the incident.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A copy of the G.D dated 19.11.2007 is annexed herewith and marked as ANNEXURE “E”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">14. That on 01.04.2008 the brother-in-law of the accused-appellant namely Shahjahan Ahmed filed a First Information Report (FIR) being No. Kotwali Model Thana Police Station Case No. 04 (4) 2008 implicating the complainant-respondent under section 420/406/506 of the Penal Code for taking away the valuables in breach of trust.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">15. That it is not true that weev`x ci nB‡Z 1 bs AvmvgxM‡bi mn‡hvwMZvq evw`bxi wbKU †hŠZzK eve` 5,00,000.00 (cuvP j¶) UvKv `vex Kwiqv Avwm‡Z‡QÓ. In fact it is the accused-appellant who, upon being repeatedly abused by thecomplainant- respondent, on 9<sup>th</sup> January 2008 finally decided not to carry out the marital relationship with her. The accused-appellant, on the same day divorced her due to aforesaid moral turpitude and continuous irritating activities that caused both mental and psychiatric problems in the accused-appellant. The accused-appellant was bound to make such a drastic decision as there was no other alternative. But the complainant-respondent was not happy with that decision at all. The ultimate consequence of her discontent is the Nari-O-Shishu Case No. 82/2008 dated 12.02.2008 under sections 11(Ga) and 30 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Domon Ain, 2000 (as amended in 2003) implicating the accused-appellant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A copy of the Divorce-notice is annexed herewith and marked as ANNEXURE “F”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">16. That it is humbly submitted that the allegation as brought against the accused-appellant is false, frivolous, concocted and fabricated and as such no offence under Sections 11(Ga) and 30 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Domon Ain, 2000 (as amended in 2003) has been committed by the accused-appellant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">17. That it is false and baseless that ‘AvmvgxMY NUbvi c~‡e©i w`b evw`bxi wbKU Zvnv‡`i evox‡Z 5,00,000.00 (cuvP j¶) UvKv †hŠZzK `vex Kwi‡j evw`bx AcviMZv cÖKvk Kivq ci w`b A_©vr 09.11.2007 Bs ZvwiL mKvj 10.00 NwUKvq evw`bx‡K Zvnvi wcÎvj‡q wbqv Av‡m Ges Awffve‡Ki mvg‡b 5,00,000.00 (cuvP j¶) †hŠZzK `vex Kwi‡j’. It is submitted that the accused-appellant has remitted about taka 2.00 crore (taka two crore) to Bangladesh in last few years. Therefore, the allegation that the accused-petitioner claimed taka 5,00,000.00 (taka five lac) as dowry from the complainant-respondent and her parents is unreasonable, unbelievable, false, concocted, vexatious which caused serious doubt in the averments of the complainant-respondent in the Complaint.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">18. That it is submitted that the complainant-respondent filed the instant case long after 3 months of the date of the alleged offence which shows that the story of the complainant-respondent is a per-planned one which does not carry any weight because of being doubtful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">19. That it is submitted that the complainant-respondent took treatment for her alleged injury 2 (two) days after the alleged assault took place which creates serious suspicion about the allegation of the assault and the entire story. More over the doctor issued the medical certificate vide dated 10.02.2008, 3 (three) months after the alleged treatment vide dated 11.11.2007, and just 2 (two) days prior to the filing of the complaint case by the complainant-respondent. Therefore, creating and issuing of medical certificate 3 (three) months after the treatment also creates serious doubt about the alleged assault upon complainant-respondent and entire allegation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Copy of the doctor’s medical certificate is annexed herewith and marked as ANNEXURE: “G”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">20. That it is submitted that upon receiving the divorce notice vide dated 09.01.2008 from the accused-appellant [the notice was posted by accused-appellant from Narashino, Tokyo, Japan on 11.01.2008 and received by the complainant-respondent in Bangladesh on 08.02.2008], the complainant-respondent became vindictive and filed this case to harass and disrepute the accused-appellant’s reputation purposely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The envelope of the copy of divorce letter that sent to the brother-in-law of the accused-appellant is annexed herewith and marked as ANNEXURE –“H”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">21. That it is submitted that the accused-appellant has been falsely implicated in the case by the interested group with a sole purpose of harassing him and maligning his good reputation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">22. That it is submitted that the learned court accepted the investigation report vide order No. 4 dated 31.03.2008, prepared by the local ward commissioner, Azizur Rahman (Akter), of the complainant-respondent. In fact, the said commissioner without investigation of the alleged offence and being biased through the influence of the complainant-respondent submitted a mind-made report which is merely an opinion of the said commissioner regarding the alleged offence. The said so called report failed to reveal any ingredient of the alleged offence. It also failed to disclose any evidence in support of the alleged offence that the complainant-respondent and other witnesses allegedly disclosed to the said commissioner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">23. That on 17.06.2008 the accused-appellant submitted a discharge petition before the learned judge, Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Domon Tribunal, Narsingdi, which was rejected by the same court.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certified copy of the order of the learned judge, vide No. 11 dated 19.06.2008 is annexed herewith and marked as ANNEXURE-“I”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">24. That having been aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the order No. 11 dated 19.06.2008 passed by the learned judge, Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Domon Tribunal, Narsingdi, in Nari-O-Shishu Case No. 82/2008 dated 12.02.2008 in rejecting the discharge petition the accused-appellant above named begs to prefer this instant appeal on the following amongst other-</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">III. For that the 1<sup>st</sup> bus leaves the Sylhet inter city bus terminal at 7.00 am in the morning. The distance between residence of the accused appellant and the complainant-respondent is 250 kilo meters. Even if the bus runs @ 70 kilo meters/ph it requires 3.50 hours to reach Narsingdi. The approximate arrival time at complainant-respondent’s residence would be at 10.30 am. and @ 60 kilo metres/ph speed of the bus, the arrival time would be 11 a.m. Therefore, the statement revealed in the complaint itself that the accused-appellant took the complainant-respondent from sylhet to Narsingdi on the date of alleged offence and demanded the dowry at 10.00 am is absurd, false, fabricated, made out only to mislead the court.
