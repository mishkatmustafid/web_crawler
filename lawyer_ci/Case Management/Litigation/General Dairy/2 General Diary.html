Most of the teachers failed to secure even 33% marks in the examination.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">03. That some of the teachers namely Syed U, N, K and R conspired against Mr. T- Unit Administrator of the DRBTC so that he cannot run the day to day affairs of the DRBTC smoothly.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">05. That some of the teachers namely Syed U, N, K and R became very furious at the decision of FI and tendered their resignation on 18.05.2003. But they threatened to kill the undersigned and Mr.- Unit Administrator of the DRBTC because of the decision of FI to recruit new efficient teachers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">06. That on 23.05.2003, at around 7.00 p.m. in the evening, the undersigned received a unknown call in his mobile wherein the caller gave death-threats to the undersigned and his family members. It may be mentioned here that the permanent address of the undersigned is at Brahmanbaria.

This time the undersigned was also told that at any favourable time the boys of the DRBTC would be attacked.
