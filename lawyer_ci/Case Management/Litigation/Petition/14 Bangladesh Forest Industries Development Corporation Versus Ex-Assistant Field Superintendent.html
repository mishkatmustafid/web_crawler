The opposite party was dismissed from his service on 30.03.93 vide Office Order No. 193 for misappropriation and defalcation of Tk. 1,30,629.39 only after proper enquiry and after compliance with all legal formalities by the Corporation. As such the impugned Judgement and order dated 21.06.99 is liable to be set aside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">02. That the petitioner No. 1 is the Chairman of Bangladesh Forest Industries Development Corporation, which is a statutory corporation (hereinafter referred to as the Corporation). The petitioner No. 2 is the General Manager of the said Corporation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">03. That the opposite-party was an employee of the Corporation. The opposite party was appointed as Supervisor in the Timber Extraction Project, Kaptai of Bangladesh Forest Industries Development Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the Project) on 23.12.73 on master roll basis and his service was regularised by Office Order No. 789 dated 14.04.78. From 19.04.85 the opposite-party was posted at Gangaram Centre of the Project as Centre in Charge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">04. That in 1988 the Board of Directors of the Corporation suspected huge financial irregularities in the Timber Extraction Project, Kaptai of the Corporation. As such the Board of Directors of the Corporation sent an investigation team to investigate and verify the actual financial state of affairs of the Project. After investigation the said team came to a preliminary conclusion that a huge amount of money received by six Centre in Charge including the opposite party of the Project as advance against various works was remain unadjusted for long time. Accordingly the team submitted its report dated 10.01.89. The said team found that as on 30.11.88 the opposite-party while posted at Gangaram Centre as Centre in Charge received substantial amount of money from the Corporation as advance for the purpose of completion of various works in his centre. Part of the said amount was expended by the opposite-party for completion of certain works and he submitted vouchers to the Corporation against the said expenses. But as on 30.11.88 an amount of Tk. 11,31,574.30 only was remain unadjusted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">05. That on the basis of the report of the said team the opposite-party on several occasions was directed to furnish the vouchers of expenditures, if any, against the said amount of Tk. 11,31,574.30 which was unadjusted till 30.11.88 or to refund the money. But neither did the opposite-party furnish any voucher nor did he refund the said amount.</p>

Although the opposite-party was suspended with effect from 12.09.89, he handed over his charge on 19.11.89. The opposite-party was also informed that he would forthwith be charge sheeted.

The opposite-party was charge sheeted for misappropriation and defalcation of money on the basis of calculation as on 30.11.88 investigated and verified by the investigation team sent by the head office. Since the amount of Tk. 2,50,000.00 only was received by the opposite-party subsequent to 30.11.88, the said amount was not included in the charge brought against the opposite-party.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">07. That the Enquiry Committee after conducting the enquiry submitted their reports dated 03.02.90 and 15.11.90. On the basis of the said report the opposite-party was reinstated in the service vide Office Order No. 254 dated 14.03.91 with lineal punishment of stoppage of three yearly increments of the opposite-party. It may be mentioned here that in 1989 on the basis of the report of the investigation team six Centre-in-charge of different centres of the Corporation were suspended for misappropriation and defalcation of huge amount of money of the Corporation.

<p style="text-align: justify;">08. That it is a fact that a huge amount of money was misappropriated and defalcated from different centres including the Gangaram centre of the Timber Extraction Project of the Corporation. To find out the actual fact with regard to the financial irregularities committed in Timber Extraction Project of the Corporation, another high powered Enquiry Committee was formed in 1992 by the Ministry of Environment and Forest vide Notification No. 208 dated 09.06.92. The Committee was formed consisting of five member headed by Dr. Md. Osman Ali, Joint Secretary of Ministry of Environment and Forest as Convenor. The high powered Committee enquired into the financial state of the Project and submitted its report on 21.07.92. In the said report the High Powered Committee stated that the Departmental Enquiry Committee who conducted the enquiry of the misappropriation and defalcation of money by the opposite-party did not provide the actual facts of adjustment of the advance money received by the opposite-party. The High Powered Committee stated that at the date of the report submitted by the said Enquiry Committee an amount of Tk. 1,41,540.82 only was remain unadjusted by the opposite-party since he received Tk. 2,50,000.00 only on 10.09.89.</p>

He was also requested to show cause within 10 days as to why he would not be dismissed from service for the allegation brought against him. It may be mentioned here that this time the opposite-party was suspended for misappropriation and defalcation of money on the basis of accountability /calculation from 01.12.88 up to his suspension.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">10. That an enquiry committee was formed consisting of two members vide Office Order No. 615 dated 10.10.92. After enquiry the Committee found the opposite-party guilty for misappropriation and defalcation of Tk. 1,30,629.39 only and submitted its report on 15.02.93.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">11. That as the allegation against the opposite-party was proved and established, the Corporation preliminarily decided to dismiss the petitioner from service. As such the opposite-party was served second show cause notice dated 16.03.93 along with the report of the Enquiry Committee and he was requested to show cause within 7 days.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">12. That the opposite-party gave reply to the second show cause notice vide his letter dated 21.03.93. The opposite-party denied the allegation and requested the Corporation to reconsider the preliminary decision of dismissal and realisation of Tk. 1,30,629.39 only from him. But he failed to produce any evidence in support of his denial.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">13. That in such circumstances the opposite-party was dismissed from service vide Office Order No. 193 dated 30.03.93. He was also directed to deposit the defalcated amount of Tk. 1,30,629.39 only within 30 days.</p>

That against the order of dismissal dated 30.03.93 the opposite-party filed appeal on 17.04.93 to the petitioner No. 1 and prayed for re-consideration of his case and re-enquiry of the allegations brought against him. As per the prayer of the opposite-party another Enquiry Committee was formed consisting of 4 (four) members.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">15. That before submission of any report by the said Enquiry Committee the opposite-party filed Civil Suit No. 17 of 1995 on 06.02.95 in the Court of the Deputy Commissioner, Rangamati Hill District for a declaration that the order of dismissal dated 30.03.93 was illegal, void, inoperative and not binding upon the opposite-party. It may be submitted here that the service of the opposite-party was under a project of the Corporation. His service was purely temporary and under a project of the Corporation and the opposite-party could be terminated at any time with prior notice. Even then the Corporation conducted the enquiry and dismissed the opposite-party only after the allegation was proved. But although there was no illegality or irregularity in dismissing the opposite-party from service, he filed the above Civil Suit challenging the dismissal order.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">16. That the Court of Deputy Commissioner, after hearing, was pleased to dismiss the suit vide Judgement and Order dated 24.02.97. Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the Judgement and Order dated 24.02.97 passed by the Court of the Deputy Commissioner the opposite-party preferred Civil Appeal No. 31 of 1997 in the Court of the Divisional Commissioner on 29.03.97.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">17. That the lower appellate Court after hearing was pleased to allow the same and set aside the Judgement and Order passed by the trial Court on wrong conception. The lower appellate Court without assessing the evidence adduced by both the parties has given findings on the facts of the previous suspension of the opposite-party vide Office Order No. 889 dated 12.09.89 for defalcation of Tk. 11,31,574.30 only. The said Court has given the finding that the said suspension was illegal. The said Court also made the following comment:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“H dl­Zl B­cn ®L¡e plL¡l£ pwÙÛ¡ ®k ¢Li¡­h S¡l£ Ll­a f¡­l a¡-C N­hoe¡l ¢houhÙº qJu¡l c¡h£ l¡­Mz”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whereas the lower appellate Court overlooked that the opposite-party was subsequently reinstated in service. The said Court also overlooked the fact that the enquiry report on the basis of which the opposite-party was reinstated was wrong and as such departmental proceedings were taken against the members of the said Enquiry Committee.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">18. That it is submitted that the lower appellate Court failed to consider that the previous suspension of the opposite-party was based on the calculation of the advances received by the opposite-party till 30.11.88, whereas the present dismissal is based on the calculation of the advances received by the opposite-party from 01.12.88 to 12.09.89. The previous suspension and the present dismissal have not arisen out of the same allegation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">19. That it is submitted that the lower appellate Court considered only the enquiry reports dated 03.02.90 and 15.11.90 submitted by the earlier Enquiry Committee on the basis of which the opposite-party was reinstated in service. But the said Court did not consider the enquiry report dated 15.02.93 submitted by the latter Enquiry Committee on the basis of which the opposite-party was dismissed from his service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">20. That it is submitted that the lower appellate Court failed to consider that the opposite-party was dismissed vide order dated 30.03.93 for misappropriation and defalcation of Tk. 1,30,629.39 only after conducting departmental enquiry by a duly constituted Enquiry Committee. The opposite-party was dismissed after compliance with all legal formalities. There was no violation of the principal of natural justice since the opposite-party was served show cause notice and he was given the opportunity of personal hearing. The lower appellate Court also failed to consider that a departmental proceeding cannot be challenged unless there is any apparent irregularity in conducting the same. Since in the instant case there is no such irregularities in conducting the departmental proceedings, the said departmental proceedings cannot be challenged.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">21. That it is submitted that the trial Court failed to give any decision on the merit of the case. The trial Court dismissed the suit on the ground of maintainability. As such since the lower appellate Court set aside the judgement of the trial Court then the lower appellate Court should either send the case to the trail Court on remand or try the suit itself. But the lower appellate Court neither itself tried the suit nor sent the suit to the trial Court on remand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">22. That it is submitted that the lower appellate Court did not consider that the proper forum to challenge such dismissal order of the opposite-party was the Administrative Tribunal. As such the civil suit filed by the said opposite-party was not maintainable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">23. That being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the Judgement and order dated 21.06.99 passed by Mr. Sharif Toyiabur Rahman, Additional Commissioner (Rangamati), Chittagong Division, Chittagong (exercising the jurisdiction of a civil Court) in Civil Appeal No. 31 of 1997 (Rangamati) the petitioners/respondents/defendants above named beg to file this application for revision on the following amongst other</p>
