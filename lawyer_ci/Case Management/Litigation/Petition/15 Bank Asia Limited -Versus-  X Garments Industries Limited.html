<p style="text-align: justify;">e. That the Back to Back L/Cs were subject to Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (ICC Publication No. 500) [hereinafter referred to as UCPDC]. The beneficiaries of the aforesaid Back to Back L/Cs shipped/supplied the goods and submitted the shipping documents to their respective Bank who in turn sent the said shipping documents to the Plaintiff/Petitioner bank for acceptance and payment within due date.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">f. That the Plaintiff/Petitioner bank received the shipping documents in terms of the Back to Back L/Cs and intimated the same to the Defendant/Opposite Party No.1. Thereafter notwithstanding the acceptance of the documents as aforesaid and taking delivery of the raw materials under the said Back to Back L/Cs, the Defendant/Opposite Party No.1 did not execute the export orders effectively. In some cases shipments were not made in time, some times there were short shipments. The Plaintiff/Petitioner bank submits that the liability of such non-execution of the Export Order is solely attributable to the deliberate/negligent failure of the Defendant/ No.1.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">g. That as per norms and practice, it was the responsibility of the Defendant/Opposite Party No.1 to settle the Back to Back L/Cs payment on or before the due dates of the respective L/C from the export proceeds or from the Defendant/Opposite Party No.1’s own source. The beneficiary of an irrevocable documentary credit enjoys maximum protection against commercial risk since it is assured that the issuing bank will pay it even if the buyer defaults or is unable to meet its payment obligation. The Defendant/Opposite Party No.1 failed to act upon as per the said norms by failing to adjust the liabilities with the Plaintiff/Petitioner bank within the maturity date. In the circumstances, full payment under the above Back to Back L/Cs could not be made out. The Plaintiff/Petitioner bank on various occasions requested the Defendant/Opposite Party No.1 to arrange payment under all the Back to Back L/Cs but to no effect. Consequently, upon being found the documents in order, the Plaintiff/Petitioner bank under a compelling situation had to effect payment under the Back to Back L/Cs by creating demand loan. The details of the demand loan that the Plaintiff/Petitioner bank was compelled to create are as follows:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">l. That the said credit facilities were sanctioned against the following securities:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a) Execution of various charge documents (i.e. Demand Promissory Note, Letters of Authority, Letter of Continuity, Revival Letter etc.);</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b) Personal guarantee of the Defendant/Opposite Part Nos. 2, 3 &amp; 4;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">c) Hypothecation of stocks Raw Materials &amp; Finished Goods vide execution of a ‘Letter of Hypothecation’, supported by a List of Hypothecated Machineries stored at the defendant No.1’s business premises at 262/1, Ibrahuimpur, (3<sup>rd</sup> floor), Dhaka dated 13.12.2003;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">d) Floating charge on all properties and immovable assets of the Defendant/Opposite Party No. 1 by way of executing ‘Deed of Floating Charge’, dated 13.12.2003.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">e) Registered mortgage of land measuring 105 decimals situated at Sreepur, Gazipur vide execution of a Registered Deed of Mortgage being No. 3504 Dated 18.04.2004, supported by a registered ‘Irrevocable General Power of Attorney’, being No.3505 dated 18.04.2004 to sell the property. The property stands in the name of the Defendant/Opposite Party Nos. 2 and 3.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">m. That the Defendant/Opposite Party No.1 thereafter failed to adjust the above Term Loan &amp; demand loan liabilities with the Plaintiff/Petitioner bank. Despite repeated requests and reminders vide letters dated 19.02.2004, 29.04.2004, 07.06.2004, 20.06.2004 and 10.08.2004 by the Plaintiff/Petitioner bank, the Defendant/Opposite Party No.1 miserably failed to adjust the aforesaid liabilities with the Plaintiff/Petitioner bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">n. That the defendant/opposite party No. 1 availed the credit facilities in full but even after the expiry of the facilities, the defendant/opposite party No. 1 did not bother to regularise the liabilities with the plaintiff/petitioner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">o. That in response to the reminders of the Plaintiff/Petitioner bank, the Defendant/Opposite Party No.1 from time to time by its letters dated 02.03.2004, 02.05.2004, &amp; 06.07.2004 acknowledged the liability with the Plaintiff/Petitioner bank and also committed to adjust the outstanding liabilities within a short period, but to no effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">p. That none of the Defendants/Opposite Parties are serious at all with regard to adjust their outstanding liabilities with the Plaintiff/Petitioner bank. It is evident from the conduct of the Defendants/Opposite Parties that they have no intention to make repayment of their entire outstanding liabilities lying with the Plaintiff/Petitioner bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">q. That the outstanding liabilities of the Defendant/Opposite Party No.1 with the Plaintiff/Petitioner Bank, as on 28.02.2005, is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a) Term Loan liabilities Tk. 3,46,70,309.91</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b) Demand Loan liabilities Tk. 31,70,715.84</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Total Tk. 3,78,41,025.75</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">r. That the defendant/opposite party No. 1 as borrower and the other Defendants/Opposite Parties as guarantors/mortgagors are liable to repay with interest the amount availed by the Defendant/Opposite Party No. 1. Since there is no chance to recovering such huge overdue from the Defendant/Opposite party No. 1 and the guarantors/mortgagors, the Plaintiff/Petitioner has filed the above suit for recovery of its legitimate dues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">03. That the Plaintiff/petitioner has come to know from very reliable sources that the Defendant/Opposite-party No. 1 and the other Defendants/Opposite Parties being owners of the mortgaged property and other property which the Defendant/Opposite Parties declared in their Personal Net Worth Statement described in the schedule below are trying to dispose of in order to defeat the decree which may be passed by this Court upon hearing of the suit. However, the Defendant/Opposite Parties are also trying to sell the hypothecated machineries described in the schedule below in order to delay the execution of the decree that may be passed against the Defendant/Opposite Parties. In such situation it is necessary to attach the scheduled movable and immovable properties. If the Scheduled properties are sold, the Plaintiff/Petitioner bank will not be able to execute the decree which may be passed in favour of the Plaintiff/Petitioner. It may be mentioned here that the value of the mortgaged immovable properties do not cover the present liabilities for which the Plaintiff/Petitioner has filed the above suit and as such the scheduled properties are required to be attached for ends of justice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">04. That it is submitted that unless the scheduled properties are attached, the Defendants/Opposite Parties will dispose of the scheduled properties in order to frustrate the decree which may be passed in favour of the Plaintiff/Petitioner by this Court and thus the Plaintiff/Petitioner shall suffer irreparable loss and injury and also be deprived from recovery of public money.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">05. That this application has been filed bonafide.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wherefore, it is most humbly prayed that this Hon’ble Court may graciously be pleased to:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a) Issue notice upon the Defendants/Opposite Parties/opposite-parties to show cause as to why an order of attachment shall not be passed attaching the scheduled properties;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b) After hearing the parties, perusal of the records and cause shown, if any, pass an order of attachment to the above effect;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">c) Pending hearing of the Rule pass an ad-interim order of attachment attaching the scheduled properties; and/or</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">d) Pass such other or further order or orders as may be deemed fit and proper.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And for this act of kindness the appellant/petitioner as in duty bound shall ever pray.</p>
