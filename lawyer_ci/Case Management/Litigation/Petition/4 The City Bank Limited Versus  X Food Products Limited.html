Since the said persons failed to pay the Cheque amount within 15 days from the date of receipt of the Notice, i.e. within 03.03.2006, the petitioner Bank was compelled to file Complaint Petition No. 319C of 2006 before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Khulna under section 138, 140 and 141 of the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 on 14.03.2006 against the Managing Director and three other Directors of the opposite-party whereupon warrant of arrest was issued by the learned Magistrate.</p>

That it is also submitted that the learned Court has failed to understand that pursuant to the provision of Order XXI, Rule 30 of the Code of Civil Procedure a decree can be executed, inter alia, by the attachment and sale of the property of the “judgement-debtor”. In the instant case no decree having been passed and no order capable of execution having been made against the petitioner Bank, the petitioner Bank is not a “judgement-debtor” within the meaning of section 2(10) of the Code of Civil Procedure. As such by the impugned orders the learned Court below has committed error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice, hence the impugned orders are liable to be set aside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">16. That being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the Order No. 1 dated 20.03.2006 and Order No. 2 dated 21.03.2006 passed by Mr. Md. Shafiqur Rahman, Joint District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court at Khulna in Title Execution Case No. 2 of 2006 registering the Execution Case and passing an order of attachment under Order XXI, Rule 51 and 52 of the Code of Civil Procedure attaching the Cheques in the custody of the petitioner and in Petition Case No. 319C of 2006 pending before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Khulna, the petitioner Bank above named beg to file this revisional petition on the following amongst other –</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">III. For that pursuant to the provision of Order XXI, Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure the “decree holder” shall apply to the Court for execution of the decree, but in the instant case no decree having been passed and no order capable of execution having been made in favour of the opposite-party, the opposite-party is not a “decree-holder” within the meaning of section 2(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure and as such by the impugned orders the learned Court below has committed error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice, hence the impugned orders are liable to be set aside.</p>
