However, the learned lawyer for the plaintiff/petitioner/opposite-party refused to receive the copies of the said application and written objection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Application under Order XXXIX, Rule 4 and Written Objection are annexed herewith and marked as ANNEXURES “E” and “E(1)”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">09. That after hearing the submissions of the learned counsel for the defendant/opposite-parties/petitioners and after perusal of the record, and the various decisions of the Supreme Court on Injunction, the learned Assistant Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court was pleased to vacate the ex-parte ad-interim order of injunction by its elaborate order No. 5 dated 01.11.2003 under Order XXXIX, Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Certified copy of the petition of Transfer Miscellaneous Case is annexed herewith and marked as ANNEXURE “G”.</p>

That after hearing of the submissions of the learned counsel for the defendant/petitioner/opposite-party, the learned District Judge was pleased to admit the Miscellaneous Case vide order No. 1 dated 02.11.2003. The learned District Judge was also pleased to pass an ex-parte order staying all further proceedings of Title Suit No. 349 of 2003.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">12. That on 03.11.2003 the plaintiff/petitioner/opposite-party filed an application in the said Transfer Miscellaneous Case under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure for stay operation of the order No. 5 dated 01.11.2003 passed by the learned Assistant Judge in Title Suit No. 349 of 2003 vacating its earlier order of ad-interim injunction. Although the said order No. 5 dated 01.11.2003 passed in Title Suit No. 349 of 2003 under Order XXXIX, Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure is an appellable order, but no appeal was filed by the plaintiff/petitioner/opposite-party before the learned Court of District Judge, yet the learned District Judge in exercise of its discretion under section 151 of Code of Civil Procedure was pleased to pass the impugned ex-parte order No. 2 dated 03.11.2003 staying operation of the said order No. 5 dated 01.11.2003.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certified copy of the application under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure filed by the plaintiff/petitioner/opposite-party is annexed herewith and marked as ANNEXURE “H”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">13. That upon receipt of the information of the said order No. 2 dated 03.11.2003, the defendants/opposite-parties/petitioners filed an application before the learned Court of District Judge on 08.11.2003 under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure for vacating its order No. 2 dated 03.11.2003. The learned lawyer for the defendants/opposite-parties/petitioners personally tendered the copy of the said application to the learned lawyer for the plaintiff/petitioner/opposite-party – Mr. Saifuddin Ahmed, but the said learned lawyer for the plaintiff/petitioner/opposite-party declined to receive the copy of the application. Consequently, the copy of the application was also filed in the Court with a note to the said effect. It may be mentioned here that although the learned lawyer for the plaintiff/petitioner/opposite-party did not receive copy of the application, nonetheless he had notice of the application filed by the defendants/opposite-parties/petitioners.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certified copy of the application under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure filed by the defendants/opposite-parties/petitioners is annexed herewith and marked as ANNEXURE “I”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">14. That the said application for vacating the order No. 2 dated 03.11.2003 was heard by the learned District Judge on 08.11.2003.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">15. That after hearing, the learned District Judge refused to vacate the impugned order but passed order No. 3 dated 08.11.2003 fixing 30.11.2003 for hearing of the same application after serving the copy and thereby refused to grant any stay as prayed for by the defendants/opposite-parties/petitioners.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">16. That it is submitted that it is well-settled principle of law that the discretionary power of the Court should be exercised for ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the Court. It is submitted that such discretion should be exercised only where no express provision is provided for in the Code of Civil Procedure, otherwise the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure shall become redundant and the Courts will act at their whim. Order XLIII, Rule 1(r) of the Code of Civil Procedure expressly provides the provision for appeal against an order under Order XXXIX, Rule 4 of the Code of the Civil Procedure. In the instant case the order No. 5 dated 01.11.2003 was passed by the learned Assistant Judge under Order XXXIX, Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure. As such an appeal lies against the said order, but no appeal has been filed by the plaintiff/petitioner/opposite-party. Nonetheless, the learned District Judge has passed the impugned order No. 2 dated 03.11.2003 in exercise of its powers under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure and stayed operation of the order No. 5 dated 01.11.2003 passed by the learned Assistant Judge. Thus the learned District Judge has committed error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice, hence the impugned orders are liable to be set aside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">17. That it is submitted that inasmuch as the plaintiff/petitioner/opposite-party had a right of appeal against the order No. 5 dated 01.11.2003 passed by the learned Assistant Judge, he could not maintain an application under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure before the learned District Judge and the learned District Judge in exercising the powers under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure has acted with material irregularity in the exercise of its jurisdiction and thus has committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice, hence the impugned order is liable to be set aside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">18. That it is submitted that all bank accounts of the Company are operated jointly by the defendant/opposite-party/petitioner No. 1 with another Director. The impugned order No. 2 dated 03.11.2003 has restrained the said defendant/opposite-party/petitioner No. 1 from operating the bank accounts of the Company and thus the business affairs of the Company has come to a standstill position. The wages and Eid bonuses of hundreds of workers as been stuck up. As such the defendants/opposite-parties/petitioners are suffering irreparable loss and injury because of the impugned order.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">19. That it is submitted that it is well settled that the Courts are reluctant in granting temporary injunction affecting the internal affairs of any company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">20. That it is submitted that the learned District Judge has committed error of law in not considering that the balance of convenience and inconvenience is not in favour of the plaintiff/petitioner/opposite-party. As such the learned District Judge has committed error of law in granting the stay and subsequently in refusing to vacate the said stay and thus the said Court has committed error of law which has resulted in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">21. That being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the order No. 2 dated 03.11.2003 passed by Mr. Md. Abdul Hai, District Judge, Dhaka in Transfer Miscellaneous Case No. 788 of 2003 staying operation of order No. 5 dated 01.11.2003 passed by the learned Assistant Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Dhaka in Title Suit No. 349 of 2003 vacating its earlier ex-parte ad-interim order of injunction dated 01.10.2003 the petitioners above named beg to file this revisional petition on the following amongst other –</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>GROUNDS</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I. For that in the facts and circumstances of the case the learned District Judge has committed serious error of law in passing the impugned order which has resulted in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice and as such the impugned order is liable to be set aside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">II. For that Order XLIII, Rule 1(r) of the Code of Civil Procedure having provided the provision for appeal against an order under Order XXXIX, Rule 4 of the said Code, the learned District Judge has committed error of law in exercising its powers under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure and thus has committed error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice and as such the impugned order is liable to be set aside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">III. For that it is well-settled principle of law that the Courts should be reluctant in granting temporary injunction affecting the internal affairs of any Company. In such a situation the impugned order having been passed affecting the internal affairs of the Company cannot be justified. As such the learned District Judge has committed error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice, hence the impugned order is liable to be set aside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">IV. For that while passing the impugned order the learned District Judge has not considered that the plaintiff/petitioner/opposite-party does not have any prima facie case and as such the said Court has committed error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice, hence the impugned order is liable to be set aside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">V. For that while passing the impugned order the learned District Judge has not considered that the balance of convenience and inconvenience is not in favour of the plaintiff/petitioners/ opposite-party and as such the learned Court has committed error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice, hence the impugned order is liable to be set aside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">VI. For that the impugned order is otherwise illegal and liable to be set aside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wherefore, it is humbly prayed that the Hon’ble Court may graciously be pleased to:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a) Issue Rule calling upon the plaintiff/petitioner/opposite-party to show cause as to why the order No. 2 dated 03.11.2003 passed by Mr. Md. Abdul Hai, District Judge, Dhaka in Transfer Miscellaneous Case No. 788 of 2003 staying operation of order No. 5 dated 01.11.2003 passed by the learned Assistant Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Dhaka in Title Suit No. 349 of 2003 vacating its earlier ex-parte ad-interim order of injunction dated 01.10.2003 passed under Order XXXIX, Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure shall not be set aside;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b) After hearing the parties and cause shown, if any, make the Rule absolute;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">c) Pending hearing of the Rule, stay operation of the impugned order No. 2 dated 03.11.2003 passed by the learned District Judge in Transfer Miscellaneous Case No. 788 of 2003 and stay all further proceedings of Title Suit No. 349 of 2003 pending in the Court of Assistant Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court at Dhaka till disposal of the Rule.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">d) Cost of the proceeding be awarded in favour of the petitioners; and</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">e) Pass such other or further order or orders as may be deemed fit and proper.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And for this act of kindness the petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</p>
