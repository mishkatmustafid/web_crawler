<p style="text-align: justify;">f) That in view of the past record of the borrower Company it is clear that NCC Bank had made transaction of Tk. 62,24,82,231.10 in equivalent foreign currency. Considering the past transaction it cannot be said that false transaction was made through a “bvg me©¯^ cÖwZôvb” as alleged in the case.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">07. That it is submitted that the letters of credit in question were opened upon the application of the borrower Company considering its past business transaction and the L/C liability was adjusted out of the export proceeds. In carrying on the business the borrower Company has got stuck up liability of Tk. 4,30,82,376.12 only as on 20.06.2002 with NCC Bank for which Money Suit No. 29 of 2002 was filed on 26.06.2002 in the Court of Joint District Judge and Artha Rin Adalat, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court at Dhaka for recovery of the said amount.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">08. That in such circumstances it cannot be said the petitioner has personally misappropriated Tk. 18,34,49,796.00 only through opening of false letters of credit. As such it is submitted that the police case as reported in the newspapers is false, fabricated and has been lodged with sole purpose of harassing the petitioner and maligning his good reputation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">09. That it is submitted that at the time of granting of any of the credit facilities as mentioned above the petitioner was not the Managing Director of NCC Bank. However, the loan was renewed and enhanced on 26.05.2001 after the inclusion of the petitioner in the Bank as the Managing Director. That was the first time when this account was brought to the attention of the petitioner. As Managing Director of NCC Bank the petitioner was not involved in the processing of the loan proposal of the borrower Company. The petitioner along with other loan proposals submitted the loan proposal of the borrower Company before the Board. It is mentioned here that in no uncertain terms that the name of Mr. Om Prakash Chowdhury or any of his concerned entities were not mentioned anywhere in the Board Memo that contained the proposal for renewal and enhancement.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Certified copy of the First Information Report (FIR) is annexed herewith and marked as ANNEXURE “B”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">11. That on the basis of the aforesaid FIR P.S. Case No. ______________ was instituted against the accused petitioner and others section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 and section 406, 409, 402, 467, 468, 471 and 109 of the Penal Code. The said P.S. Case was sent to the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka on ____________.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">12. That the Investigating Officer (IO) of the said P.S. Case prepared and submitted the Charge Sheet No. _______ dated __________. In the Charge Sheet the allegation against the petitioner has been stated in the following manner:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certified copy of the Charge Sheet is annexed herewith and marked as ANNEXURE “C”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">13. That after lodgment of the FIR the police obtained statements under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procure from _____ witnesses at different time. None of the witnesses made any statement involving or referring to the accused-petitioner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certified copies of the Statements under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procure given by the witnesses are annexed herewith and marked as ANNEXURES “D Series”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">14. That it is submitted that no accusation or even any reference has been made against the accused-petitioner in the FIR lodged by the Bureau of Anti Corruption or in the statements made by the witnesses under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which discloses any of the ingredients under the section referred to in the FIR or Charge Sheet. As such the proceedings against the accused-petitioner is nothing but an abuse of the process of the Court and as such liable to be quashed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">15. That it is submitted that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">16. That it is submitted that from the FIR and Charge Sheet it is apparent that there was no appropriation of money by the accused-petitioner. It is not a case that the accused-petitioner has defalcated or misappropriated any money from NCC Bank, rather the fact is that certain letters of credit were issued by NCC Bank in its usual course of business at the request of its client. It is a business risk, which NCC Bank had taken by issuing the letters of credit. Now even if the allegation of no-repatriation</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">17. a lawyer while vetting the property documents of any specific property cannot be aware that the owner of the said property is already dead, unless such information is provided to the lawyer. In the present case from the FIR it is clear that the fact of demise of Khandaker Shamsul Huda was not also within the knowledge of the Bank at the time of sanctioning the loan. The accused-Bank has come across the said information while it was trying to find out Khandaker Shamsul Huda in his permanent address at Faridpur. Accordingly, Bank did not bring any accusation against the accused-petitioner. But the IO with the malafide intention to harass the accused-petitioner has included the name of the accused-petitioner in the Charge Sheet without making any specific charge against him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">18. That the case is now pending before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka as G. R. Case No. 1623 of 2002.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">19. That it is submitted that the inclusion of the name of the accused-petitioner in the Charge Sheet by the IO is an abuse of his power and proceeding of the criminal case against the accused-petitioner on the basis of the said Chart Sheet is nothing but an abuse of the process of the Court. No allegation whatsoever was made in the FIR against the accused-petitioner. No specific charge has been made against the accused-petitioner in the Charge Sheet. In such circumstances the proceeding against the accused-petitioner is nothing but an abuse of process of the Court and the same may be quashed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">20. That it is submitted that the function of a lawyer in verification of title of the owner of a land does not include the function of identifying the owner at the time of execution and registration of the Mortgage Deed. As such the lawyer cannot be held responsible if the Mortgage Deed is executed and registered by any person other than the actual owner of the land. Therefore, the impugned proceeding against the accused-petitioner is liable to be quashed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">21. That it is submitted that the learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate has committed serious error of law in entertaining the proceeding against this accused-petitioner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">22. That it is submitted that providing legal opinion by a lawyer on the basis of papers/documents referred to a lawyer cannot be an offence under sections 419, 420, 465, 467, 471, 406, 34 and 109 of the Penal Code. As such the instant proceeding is nothing but an abuse of the process of the Court, hence this application has been filed for quashing of the proceedings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">23. That it is submitted that unless the instant proceeding is quashed, no lawyer will feel save in providing legal opinion on the basis of papers/documents referred to him. As such the instant proceedings should be quashed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">24. That in the premises set forth, the accused-petitioner begs to prefer this revisional petition for quashing the proceeding in P.S. Case No. 7(8)2002 under sections 419, 420, 465, 467, 471, 406, 34 and 109 of the Penal Code now pending before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka on the following amongst others-</p>

For that the FIR or the Charge Sheet or the Statements made by the witnesses under section 161 of the Cope of Criminal Procedure do not disclose any criminal case against the accused-petitioner and the impugned proceeding against him is nothing but an abuse of the process of the Court and as such liable to be quashed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">II. For that the impugned proceeding against this accused-petitioner is nothing but an abuse of process of the Court in that no accusation or even reference against this accused-petitioner has been made in the FIR lodged by the Bank and as such the proceeding is liable to be quashed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">III. For that the impugned proceeding against this accused-petitioner is nothing but an abuse of process of the Court in that no accusation or even reference against this accused-petitioner has been made by the six witnesses in their Statements under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and as such the proceeding is liable to be quashed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">IV. For that the impugned proceeding against this accused-petitioner is clearly an abuse of process of the Court inasmuch as the Investigating Officer without making any specific charge against him has included the name of the accused-petitioner in the Charge Sheet and as such the proceeding is liable to be quashed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">V. For that the impugned proceeding against this accused-petitioner is an abuse of process of the Court because it is proceeding on the basis of the Charge Sheet filed by the IO including the name of this accused-petitioner without making any specific charge against him and as such the proceeding is liable to be quashed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">VI. For that providing of legal opinion by a lawyer on the basis of papers/documents referred to him cannot be an offence under sections 419, 420, 465, 467, 471, 406, 34 and 109 of the Penal Code and as such the proceeding is liable to be quashed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">VII. For that while the name of the accused-petitioner is not present in the FIR, the IO in order to mislead the Court has stated in his Charge Sheet – GW‡fv‡KU †gv¯Zdv Avw`j (<b>GRvnvi bvgxq I Z`‡šZ cÖvß</b>) whereupon the learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate has issued warrant of arrest against the accused-petitioner and as such the proceeding is liable to be quashed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">VIII. For that the function of a lawyer in verification of title of the owner of a land does not include the function of identifying the owner at the time of execution and registration of the Mortgage Deed and as such the lawyer cannot be held responsible if the Mortgage Deed is executed and registered by any person other than the actual owner of the land. Therefore, the impugned proceeding against the accused-petitioner is liable to be quashed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">IX. For that unless the instant proceeding is quashed, no lawyer will feel save in providing legal opinion on the basis of papers/documents referred to him and as such the instant proceedings should be quashed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wherefore, it is humbly prayed that your Lordships would graciously be pleased to:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(a) Issue Rule calling upon the opposite- party No. 1 to show cause as to why the proceeding in Cantonment P.S. Case No. 7(8)2002 under sections 419, 420, 465, 467, 471, 406, 34 and 109 of the Penal Code now pending in the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka as G. R. Case No. 1623 of 2002 shall not be quashed so far it relates to the accused-petitioner and after hearing the parties and cause shown, if any, make the Rule absolute;</p>

Case No. 1623 of 2002 against the accused-petitioner;</p>
