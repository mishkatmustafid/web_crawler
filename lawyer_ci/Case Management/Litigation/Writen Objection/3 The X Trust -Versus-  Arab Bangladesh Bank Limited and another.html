(def. 3), The XTrust (def. 4), Mrs. Sultana Chowdhury (def. 5) for recovery of money taka 60,56,875.00 (taka sixty lac fifty six thousand eight hundred seventy five) as on 30.09.98 by sale of mortgaged property. After hearing both the contesting parties the learned Court passed the judgment and decree on 12.07.2001 and final decree on 09.04.2003 and released 33 decimal of land from the schedule land from the scheduled 50 decimal of land and foreclosed the remaining 17 decimal of land in question.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">(c) That the title of the remaining 17 decimal of land was originally belonged to the Mr. Tariq, mortgagor at the time of execution of the said mortgage deed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(d) That the plaintiff could able to contest the Suit which was decreed <i>exparte</i> against the plaintiff, even after the judgment and decree, complying the provision stipulated in section 32 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain 2003 and Order IX, Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. But the plaintiff did not do so. Rather he initiated some unnecessary proceedings which delayed the Title Execution Case No. 89/2003.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(e) The defendant filed the execution suit vide Title Execution Suit No. 89/2003 and published the auction notice in the national dailies on 13.03.2004 and fixed the date of auction on 30.03.2004. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed an application under Order XXI Rule 29 read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and Section 57 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain 2003 in the Artha Rin Adalat No. 3, Dhaka, for stay of all further proceedings of the Artha Jari Case no. 89/2003 till the disposal of this instant Suit.

<p style="text-align: justify;">(f) That the plaintiff later on filed a revisional application on 10.04.2004 vide Civil Revision No. 980/2004 in the Honorable High Court Division and obtained a Rule.

The Honorable Court had the findings that if the plaintiff’s allegation of non-service of summons of the suit is correct, his remedy of separate suit is not barred provided his remedies under the Artha Rin Adalat stood barred at the time of the filing of the Suit for no fault of his own. In fact, the plaintiff willfully did not contest the Suit. He had sufficient relief under Section 32 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain 2003. The proper forum for the plaintiff was to file a Miscellaneous Case under the Order IX, Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 read with Section 32 and 57 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain 2003, if he can prove that he was unaware of the judgment and order of the Artha Rin adalat no. 3.</p>

The only intention of the plaintiff is to harass and illegal gain from the defendant. Therefore, there is no cause of action arose to file this suit against the defendant. The plaintiff added the defendant in this suit with <i>mala fide</i> intention to harass the defendant. This suit is not maintainable against the defendant. Therefore, the suit filed by the plaintiff is liable to be dismissed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wherefore, it is humbly prayed that the Learned Court would graciously be pleased to dismiss the suit filed by the plaintiff with compensatory costs in favour of the defendant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And for this act of kindness the defendant as in duty bound shall ever pray.</p>
