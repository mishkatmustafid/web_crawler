The defendant at the request of the plaintiff vide letter 04.08.2003 re-schedule the entire liability of the plaintiff vide Sanction Advice dated 28.06.2004. Under the terms of the aforesaid Sanction Advice the plaintiff was under an obligation to adjust the then outstanding taka 8,07,48,346.11 (eight crore seven lac forty eight thousand three hundred forty six taka and eleven paisa) in the following manner:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(a) down payment of taka 50,00,000.00; and</p>
