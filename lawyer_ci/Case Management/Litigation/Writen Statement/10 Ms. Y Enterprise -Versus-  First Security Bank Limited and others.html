<p style="text-align: justify;">17. That the allegation made in paragraph no. 9 is denied. The closure of business institution of the plaintiff was due to plaintiff’s own fault. Since the plaintiff did not pay the dues in the L.T.R. account since 04.12.2004, the said account became the expired loan. The defendant requested the plaintiff to adjust the expired L.T.R. account vide a letter dated 30.11.2005 from the Branch Manager.

The statement that the plaintiff had the balance of taka 12,31,317.45 in his account on 31.07.2005 is false and fabricated. In fact the plaintiff owed to the defendant that amount of money. The defendant requested the plaintiff to pay the outstanding dues and adjust the accounts maintained by the plaintiff. But the plaintiff did not pay outstanding dues till to date in spite of repeated request and personal approach by the defendant. Consequently the plaintiff’s account became classified. Therefore, he was not sanctioned any further credit facilities as per Bangladesh Bank Rules.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">20. That the statement made in paragraph no. 12 is denied. Since the outstanding due was not adjusted even after repeated reminders, L.C. was not sanctioned in favour of the plaintiff. The statement that the plaintiff lost the raw materials worth of taka 2.00 crore is false and fabricated, as such, the statement is denied. When the plaintiff was requested to submit the stock report, the defendant was informed that there was no stock and all were sold out.

<p style="text-align: justify;">21. That the statement made in paragraph no. 13 is denied. That the statement that the plaintiff was not sanctioned loan and its enhancement was false and fabricated. The plaintiff had not even more than 10 employees.

The loss of business and loss of fame of the plaintiff, if any, is due to their own fault. Even after sanctioning the plaintiff CC (Hypo) 25.00 lac and L.T.R. limit 50.00 lac, the defendant sanctioned taka 2.35 crore credit facilities in 2005. The defendant stopped sanctioning further credits in favour of the plaintiff as per Bank Company’s Act when the plaintiff became the defaulter account holder.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">24. That the statements made in paragraph no. 16 is denied. The defendant is not required to pay any damages to the plaintiff in accordance with law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">25. That the allegation made in paragraph no. 17 is denied.

The defendant published auction notice to sell the mortgaged property having being empowered by the Irrevocable Power of Attorney (IGPA) to sell and with the direction from the Artha Rin Court No. 2. As per these the defendant can sell the mortgaged property without notice. Therefore, filing the Writ petition in the Honorable High Court Division is the tactic of the plaintiff to make delay in payment the outstanding dues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">26. That the statements made in paragraph no. 18-20 are denied.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">27. That the real fact is that the plaintiff opened an account with the defendant in the course of the business. In an application vide letter dated 10.04.2002 the plaintiff applied to the defendant for credit facilities. The defendant approved Cash Credit (Hypo) limit for 12.00 lac only @ 16% interest p.a. with quarterly rest subject to change from time to time vide Sanction letter No. FSBL/BANG/ADV/682/2002 dated 18.06.2002 in favour of the plaintiff for a period until 30.06.2003.

The plaintiff again applied for enhancement of the LTR limit from 50.00 lac to 270.00 lac and for opening L.C. up to $2,00,000.00 which is equivalent to taka 128.00 lac. The defendant sent the proposal to the Head Office. The defendant paid the amount against the shipping documents of the plaintiff and its sister concern M/s. N.H. Enterprise and M/s. Delta Shoes Industries by creating PAD (payment against documents) Loan in favour of the plaintiff and its sister concerns. The defendant opened 7 LTR account in the name of the defendant, 2 LTR in the name of M/s. N.H. Enterprise and 3 LTR accounts in the name of M/s. Delta Shoes and Chemical Industries in different dates. The defendant requested the plaintiff to pay the outstanding dues and adjust the accounts maintained by the plaintiff. But the plaintiff did not pay outstanding dues till to date in spite of repeated request and personal approach by the defendant. The total outstanding dues in C.C. (Hypo) facilities of the plaintiff stands at 2,18,15,117.00 taka. The plaintiff did not pay heed to series of reminders to pay the dues from the defendant.

Finding no other alternative the defendant filed an Artha Rin Suit No. 199/2006 for realisation of taka 2,18,15,117.00 as on 31.08.2006 in the learned Artha Rin Adalat No. 2, Dhaka, which is now pending before the above learned Court.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">28. That the only intention of the plaintiff is to harass and illegal gain from the defendant. Therefore, there is no cause of action arose to file this Suit against the defendant. The plaintiff added the defendant’s name in this suit with <i>melafide</i> intention to harass the defendant.
