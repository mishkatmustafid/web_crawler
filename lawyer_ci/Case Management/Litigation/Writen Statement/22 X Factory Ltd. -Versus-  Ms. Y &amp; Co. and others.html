The defendant No. 4 is only concerned with the shipping documents of the L/C, which has been accepted by the plaintiff.

<p style="text-align: justify;">14. That regarding the statements made in paragraph No. 12 are mostly not applicable upon this defendant no. 4. It is submitted that, as stated earlier, there is no cause of action arisen to file any suit against this defendant No. 4.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">14. That with the statements made in paragraph No. 13 and 14 of the plaint, the defendant no. 4 is not concerned and as such offers no comments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">15. That the facts are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a) That the plaintiffs have sought decree <i>inter alia</i> to declare that the defendant No. 1 and 2 are bound to replace 10,000 sets Steel Pin (Short Shank) to the plaintiff in due time as per the purchase order or deed of purchase and drawing. The plaintiff also filed an application seeking temporary injunction restraining the defendant No. 4 from making payment against letter of credit no. 043203010455 dated 22.09.2003 (the “L/C”) to the defendant Nos. 1 &amp; 2. That it is submitted that by a series of decisions (reported in 33 DLR (AD)298, 55 DLR (AD)56 and 2 MLR (AD)396), the Appellate Division of the Y Court of Bangladesh has decided that no injunction can be granted on a bank prohibiting it to make payment under an Irrevocable Letter of Credit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b) That is submitted that the L/C in question incorporated under the terms and conditions of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (1993 Revision, ICC Publication No. 500) (the “UCPDC”). According to the provisions of UCPDC, a Letter of Credit of credit transaction creates a contract between the Opening or Issuing Bank and the Advising or Negotiating Bank, which is completely autonomous and separate from the underlying contract of supply of goods. The issuing bank of a letter of credit is completely unconcerned with the performance of the underlying contract. As soon as the documents tendered by the beneficiary of the letter of credit are in conformity with the mandate of the letter of credit, the issuing bank (in this case defendant No. 4) is under an absolute obligation to reimburse the bank that has negotiated and/or made payment against such documents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the instant suit, at the request of BCIC on account of the plaintiff, the defendant No. 4 opened the L/C in favour of the defendant no. 1 (the “Beneficiary”). Subsequently, the defendant No. 4 received shipping documents from the beneficiary’s bank. The shipping documents contained some discrepancies, which were referred by the defendant No. 4 to beneficiary’s bank and to the plaintiff. The plaintiff accepted the discrepancies vide their letter dated 08.12.2003 against which the defendant No. 4 endorsed/delivered the shipping documents to the plaintiff and the plaintiff released the goods with the same. Since the defendant No. 4 endorsed and released the shipping documents to the plaintiff upon their acceptance of the discrepancies in the documents, the defendant no. 4 was legally obliged under UCPDC to make payment of the L/C amount to the Beneficiary’s bank and has accordingly made payment of the said amount to the Beneficiary’s bank on 24.12.2004.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">c) That the allegations raised by the plaintiff in the plaint relates solely to the quality of goods supplied by the Beneficiary, with which the defendant No. 4 is not concerned at all. The defendant No. 4 is only concerned with the shipping documents of the L/C, which has been accepted by the plaintiff. As stated earlier, since the shipping documents has been accepted by the plaintiff and goods have been released by the plaintiff against the said documents, the defendant no. 4 in accordance with its obligation under UCPDC, has legally and rightfully made payment of the L/C amount to the Beneficiary’s bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">d) That it is stated that Article 3 (a) of the UCPDC reads as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Credits, by their nature, are separate transaction from the sales or other contract(s) on which thsy may be based and banks are in no way concerned with or bound by such contract(s), even if any reference whatsoever to such contract(s) is included in the credit”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, Article 4 of UCPDC provides as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“In credit operations all parties concerned deal with documents, and not in goods, services and/or other performances to which the documents may relate”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, at all stages of the relevant transaction, the defendant No. 4 was concerned only with documents and can in no way be held responsible for the goods for which the L/C was opened. The plaintiff is thus under obligation to reimburse the defendant no. 4 for the L/C amount, which it has paid to the Beneficiary’s bank. The plaintiff has filed the instant suit and application to harass this defendant and to avoid its obligation to make payment to the defendant no. 4.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">13. That the prayers made in the plaint are not tenable in law and hence the plaintiff company is not entitled to get any relief in the above mentioned suit and as such the suit is liable to be dismissed with cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">14. That in the circumstances above the aforesaid suit is not sustainable in law and the plaintiff is not entitled to get any relief and as such the above mentioned suit is liable to be dismissed with cost for ends of justice, rather the defendant No. 1-3 will suffer irreparable loss and injury.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wherefore, it is humbly prayed that your Honour would graciously be pleased to dismiss the suit filed by the plaintiff with compensatory costs in favour of the defendant No. 4.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And for this act of kindness the defendant no. 1-3 as in duty bound shall ever pray.</p>
