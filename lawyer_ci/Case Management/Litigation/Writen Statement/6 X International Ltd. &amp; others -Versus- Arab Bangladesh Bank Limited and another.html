<p style="text-align: justify;">02. That the application is filed with malafide intention to harass these defendants/opposite-party Nos.1-4 and with an intention to deprive these defendants/opposite parties in recovering its legitimate dues, hence it is liable to be rejected.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">19.

<p style="text-align: justify;">21. That the statements made in paragraph No.1(z) of the application regarding the cause of action of the suit filed by the plaintiffs are baseless. Since these defendants/opposite parties did not acted beyond the terms of the agreement in question no cause of action arouse at all and that is why the plaintiff has no <i>locus standi</i> to file the suit and as such the suit is liable to be dismissed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">23. That the statements made in paragraph 4 and 5 of the application are false, fabricated, baseless, malafide and highly motivated as such denied by these defendants/opposite parties. In this regard it is submitted that the balance of convenience and inconvenience is favour of these defendants/opposite parties and the plaintiffs/applicationers has no prima-facie arguable case as from the forgoing it is apparent that these defendants/opposite parties acted in accordance with the agreement in question. Further, if any loss at all suffered by the plaintiffs/applicationers, the loss undoubtedly shall be compensated in terms of money and as such the plaintiffs/applicationers are not entitled to get the order of temporary injunction. There are many reported decisions of Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh which supports the same.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wherefore, it is most humbly prayed that your honour would graciously be pleased to reject the application under Order XXXIX, Rule 1 and 2 read with section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure filed by the plaintiffs/applicationers with costs; and/or pass such other or further order or orders as your honour deems fit and proper.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And for this act of kindness this defendants/opposite-parties, as in duty bound shall ever pray.</p>
