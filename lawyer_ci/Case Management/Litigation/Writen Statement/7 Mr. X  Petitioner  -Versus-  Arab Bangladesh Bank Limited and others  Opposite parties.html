<p style="text-align: justify;">(c) That the petitioner in collusion with the opposite party No.2 &amp; 3 came up with a false plea with a view to vitiate the lawful mortgage created by the opposite party No.3 in favour of this opposite party and thereby to frustrate the decree obtained by this opposite party in Title Suit No. 104 of 1996. The decree in the aforesaid suit was passed foreclosing the suit property and this opposite party thus is legally entitled to sell the suit property by way of auction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(d) That it is further submitted that Monir Chemicals Ltd. never obtained any right, title, interest or enjoyed possession whatsoever over the case property at any time. Hence, Monir Chemical Ltd. had not accrued any right or interest so as to execute any deed in favour of any body. As such, the alleged power of attorney executed by Monir Chemical Ltd. or it’s director(s) in favour of Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Shangstha to sell the case property have no value in the eye of law. Thus any sale of the case property by Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Shangstha to the petitioner is also void and has no value in the eye of law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">21. That the petitioner has obtained no title or interest or possession over the case property and as such the petition of the petitioner is liable to be rejected with compensatory costs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wherefore it is humbly prayed that the case filed against the opposite party No.1 be dismissed by the Hon’ble Court with compensatory costs and/or pass any order as the Court may deem fit and proper.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AND for this act of kindness the opposite party No.1 as in duty bound shall ever pray.</p>
