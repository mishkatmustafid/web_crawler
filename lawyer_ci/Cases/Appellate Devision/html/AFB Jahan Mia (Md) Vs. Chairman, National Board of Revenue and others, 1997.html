The appellant joined thePresidents Secretariat in Islamabad on 29-9-70 as an Upper Division Assistant.On return to Bangladesh he was taken in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in thesame post carrying a scale of pay of Taka 310.00-670.00 which was in Grade-VIIof National Scale of Pay. His service was declared as surplus by the Ministryof Foreign Affairs by a memo dated 23.6.76 and his name was forwarded to theMinistry Establishment for absorption. By an order dated 20-11-76 the Ministryof Foreign Affairs asked the appellant to Join the Taxes Department as Inspectorof Taxes. He was released from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 22-11-76 andon the same day was absorbed as inspector of Taxes in the Office of theIncome-tax Commissioner, Dhaka (North Zone) in Central Salary Circle-2 in thesame scale of pay as above. At the time of filing the petition before theAdministrative Tribunal the appellant serving in the Contractors’ Circle-3 atDhaka (East Zone). At the time of preparation of the List Seniority theappellant found that his period service was counted not from the date of his ofthe service on 29 9-70 but from the date of joining as Inspector of taxes on22-11-76. The appellant sent a representation to the Commissioner of Taxes,Dhaka (East Zone) on 10-3-86 and two successive representations to the ChairmanNational Board of Revenue on 21-11-85 and 17-4-86. After an exchange of opinionbetween the Commissioner of Taxes, the Chairman, National Board of Revenue andthe Ministry of Establishment, all the three agreed that the appellant willcount his seniority in his present service from 22-11-76 i.e., the date hejoined the post of Inspector of Taxes and that there is no scope of countinghis previous service for seniority. The appellant came to know of the saiddecision by a Memo. Dated 12-11-86 from the Commissioner of Taxes, Dhaka (EastZone). The appellant thereafter filed the instant petition before theAdministrative Tribunal with a prayer for a direction to reckon the period from29-9-70 for the purpose of counting his seniority, as also for some otherreliefs. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">3. The Ministry of Establishment,opposite party No. 4 in the appellant’s petition, did not file any writtenstatement and did not contest the case. A written statement was filed byopposite party No. 1 to the application namely the Commissioner of Taxes. Dhaka(East-Zone) and opposite party No. 2, the Chairman, National Board of revenue.Their case was that in the National Scale of Pay introduced on and from 1-7-73,an Upper Division Assistant and an Inspector of Taxes carried the same scale ofpay (Taka 310.00-670.00) and that is the reason why the appellant was absorbedas an Inspector of Taxes, but previous to 1-7-73 an Upper Division Assistant inthe then Central Government used to draw a pay in, the scale of Taka135.00—315.00, whereas the scale of pay of Inspector of Taxes, was Taka185.00-450.00. From 1-7-77 the post of Inspector of Taxes carried a scale ofpay of Taka 425.00-1035.00 and the post of Upper Division Assistant carried ascale of pay Taka 370.00-745.00 and the two posts were placed in differentGrades. The history of these two posts shows that they are not of equal class.The post of inspector of Taxes is a higher post than that of Upper DivisionAssistant. It is for this reason that it was not possible to count the previousservice of the appellant in counting his seniority. If he was absorbed as anUpper Division Assistant in the Taxes Department then his previous servicecould have been counted. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">4. While the AdministrativeTribunal agreed with the contention of the appellant that the period of hisservice before his absorption as Inspector of Taxes ought to be counted for thepurpose of determining his seniority and thus allowed his application in part,the Administrative Appellate Tribunal agreed in full with the submissions ofthe respondents and held that the two posts of Upper Division Assistant andinspector of Taxes being not of the same status, one entailing ministerial functions and the other executive the appellant is not entitled tocount his previous service for determination of seniority. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">5. Leave was granted to considerthe appellant’s submission that the impugned judgment of the Appellant Tribunalwas not signed by all the three Members of the Tribunal under section 5(2) ofthe Administrative Tribunals Act, 1980 (Act No. VII of 1981) and hence it isliable to be set aside. Leave was also granted to consider the appellant’ssubmission that the Appellate Tribunal failed to take into consideration theprovisions of the Services (Re-organisation and Conditions) Act, 1975 (Act NoXXXII of 1975) by which graded service was introduced n Bangladesh with effectfrom July 1, 1973 and that in a graded service, seniority, counts from the dateof entry in a grade. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">6. Mr. Abdur Rab Chowdhury,learned Counsel for the appellant, has given up the first contention on whichleave has been granted and has preferred to concentrate on the second point ofleave. He argued at length on the concept of grade, scale of pay, past service,cadre rules, counting of seniority and a number of other matters and reinforcedhis arguments by copious references to various Government memos. e.g. Ministryof Cabinet Affairs, Establishment Division Memos. dated  7-8-73, 13-8-73,11-3-74, 4-6- 76, 14-10-84 and 7-4-87, Ministry of Finance Memos. dated 15 9-79and 1-1-84, the meaning of the word “equivalent” from Law Lexicon, theBangladesh Civil Service Seniority Rules 1983, and two unreported decisions ofthis Division in the case of <b><i>Chairman, T&amp;T Board vs Mostafizur Rahman(Civil Appeal Nos  158 and 159 of 1979) and AFM Badiur Rahman vsShamsuzzaman and ors (Civil petition for Leave to Appeal No 255 of 1991). </i></b>He submits that at the  very least theappellant is entitled to count his seniority from 1-7-73. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">7. Mr. Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan,learned Additional Attorney General appearing for the respondents, elaborated‘the respondents’, submissions by reading out the written statement which hasalso been reiterated in the Concise Statement filed on behalf of therespondents. He has also placed his reliance on the case of <b><i>Vice-Chancellor,LN Mithila University vs. Dayanand Jha, (1986)3 SCC 7.</i></b> </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">8. After having listened to the painstakingsubmissions of both sides on an elaborate canvas, we are relieved to find thatthe issue is indeed a simple one which has been missed by the appellant and therespondents alike and consequently by both the Tribunals below. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">9.

To provide for thereorganization of the services of the Republic and of public bodies andnationalised enterprises and for prescribing unified grades and scales of payand other terms and conditions of service for persons employed in suchservices, the Services (Re-organisation and Conditions) Act, 1975 (Act No. XXXIIof 1975) was promulgated with retrospective effect from 1-7-73 and it will beconvenient here to reproduce sections 3-7 of the said Act as hereunder:</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">         “<b>3.

Following receipt ofrecommendation the Administrative and Service Reorganisation Committee and theNational pay Commission, the Government by Memo No. MF(IC)-2-73-1 dated 7-9-73announced that they decided to introduce four National Pay Scales from GradesX-VII (Out of 10 recommended) from 1-7-73 and for that purpose an ExpertCommittee Implementation Cell was set up. (See the case of SM Massod Al-Mamunand other vs Bangladesh, 29 DLR 393. Only 10 Grades were recommended by theNational Pay Commission within these grades various posts previously carryingdifferent scales of pay and entitling higher or lower qualities of functionswere amalgamated into one grade. Thus to illustrate from the respondents’written statement, the three following posts carrying three different scales ofpay and entailing different kinds of functions were all amalgamated in theNational Grade and were given to enjoy the same National Scale of pay at Taka310.00—670.00. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">  </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="color:black">Post                        Scale of pay prior to 1-7-73</span></b><span style="color:black"> </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">1.

The National Grade and scaleof pay, limited to 10 Grades only created anomalies. It does not appear eitherthat by formally passing an order in Bangladesh Gazette, the Governmentimplemented the recommendation of the National Pay Commission in exercise ofits power under section 5 of Act No. XXXII of 1975. While facing difficultiesin the implementation of the recommendations of the national Pay Commission,the Government constituted a new Pay and Service Commission to recommendservice and pay structure. It is only following the recommendation of the payand Service Commission that the Government in exercise of the powers conferredby section 5 of Act No. XXXII of 1975 passed The Services (Grades, Pay andAllowances) Order, 1977 on 20-12-77, giving the said order both commencing dayand a retrospective effect from the 1st July, 1977. This order was published inthe Bangladesh Gazette, Extraordinary on 20-12-77. Section 3 of the said Order,1977 which was not noticed by the appellant, the respondents and the Tribunalsbelow provided as follows: </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">             “3. New National Grades andscales of pay (1) on the commencing day all the grades and scales of pay inforce, immediately before that day, in respect of the posts mentioned in theAnnexure shall cease to exist and on and from that day there shall come intoforce the following New National Grades and Scales of pay, namely……..” </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">13. Then I-XXI New NationalGrades and Scales of pay were mentioned. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">14. In the Annexure that followedan Upper Division Assistant who was previously in Grade-VII of National Gradeand Scale of Pay carrying a scale of pay of Taka 310.00—670.00 was now placedin Grade-XV carrying a scale of pay of Taka 370.00—745.00 in the New NationalGrade and Scale of Pay: But an Inspector of Taxes who was placed in the samegrade-VU and same scale of pay of Taka 310.00—670.00 in the National Grade andScale of Pay was given a higher grade, i.e. Grade-XIV and a higher scale o payat Taka 400.00—825.00 in the New National Grade and Scale of Pay. Obviously itis this New National Grade and Scale of Pay which will determine theappellant’s entitlement to counting his previous service for the purpose ofdetermining his seniority, because he cannot under the new dispensation referto or claim any right arising from the National Grade and Scale of Payintroduced on 1-7-73 which “ceased to exist” on and from 1-7-77. Section 7 ofAct No. XXXII of 1975 authorises the Government to vary or revoke any conditionof service to the appellant’s disadvantage if an order is passed under section4 or 5 thereof. The appellant therefore lost all the privileges and rights thathe enjoyed under the National Grade and Scale of Pay introduced from 1-7-73.From 1-7-77 his position was absolutely different. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">15. The absorption of surpluspublic servants was made from time to time as per Government instructions anddecisions but a statute, namely, The Surplus Public Servants AbsorptionOrdinance, 1985 (Ordinance No. XXIV of 1985) was promulgated as late as on 20thMay, 1985 giving it a retrospective effect from the 16th December, 1971 exceptsection 3 thereof. Sections 5 and 6 of the said Ordinance, which are relevant,are as follows: </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">            “5.

Previous to the promulgationof Ordinance No. XXIV of 1985 the Establishment Division issued memo. No.ED(R-II) S-59/77-25 (500) dated 20-3-79 providing therein the method ofabsorption of surplus personnel, <i>inter alia,</i> as follows: </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">             “<b>1. From one GovernmentDepartment to another.-</b>A surplus person should be allowed to Count his pastservice in the parent department towards fixation of his seniority, calculationof pay, leave and pension and there should be relaxation of educationalqualification and age if he is appointed in the absorbing department to anequivalent post or cadre.” </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">17. This Memo. is thesheet-anchor of the appellant s case. It is his case that in 1976 the post ofInspector of Taxes and an Upper Division Assistant were equivalent postsbecause they carried the same grade and scale of pay and there was no otheryardstick of measurement of equivalence between a ministerial post and anexecutive post at that time. The appellant is right. Subject to theimplementation of the recommendations of the National Pay Commission by anorder notified in the Official Gazette under section 5 of Act No. XXXII of 1975if the appellants seniority was fixed at any time between 22-11-76 (when hejoined the Taxes Department as Inspector of Taxes) and 30-6-77 (when the NewNation Grade and Scale of Pay was not yet introduced), he could have reasonablyclaimed the counting of his past service for determining his seniority. Therespondents could not then have been heard to say that the post of Inspectorand the post of Upper Division Assistant are higher or lower posts, entailinghigher or lower degrees of responsibility. The Inspector of Taxes and UpperDivision Assistant being equivalent posts both for purposes of grade and scaleof pay the appellant was entitled from 22-11-76 to 30-6-77 1 to Count hisprevious service for fixation of seniority, in terms of the EstablishmentDivision’s Memo.dated 20-3-79. But both the appellant and the respondentsmissed the essential point in the entire litigation namely that on and from1-7-77 the amalgamation of Upper Division Assistant and Inspector of Taxes intothe same grade and scale of pay was done away with, making it a thing of thepast, an obliterated event, leaving no trace of any vested right that may haveaccrued upto 30-6-77. From 1-7-77 an Upper Division Assistant and Inspector ofTaxes are not equivalent posts, either in respect of grade or in respect ofscale of pay. The appellant will not be considered to have been absorbed in anequivalent post. Yes, he was absorbed in an equivalent post in 1976, But theequivalence “Ceased to exist” from 1-7-77. Because of the respondents’inability to bring into sharp focus this vital legal aspect of the matter thejudgment of the Appellate Tribunal has made a foray into redundantconsiderations like the distinction between the duties of an Upper DivisionAssistant and an Inspector of Taxes. The basic legal position is that from1-7-77 the appellant remains absorbed in a post different in grade and scale ofpay from the post of Upper Division Assistant and therefore with no assistancefrom the Establishment Division Memo. dated 20-3-79 and the various otherGovernment Memos. brought to our notice by Mr. Abdur Rab Chowdhury can theappellant in any way be permitted to count his previous service from 29-9-70 to21-11-76 for fixation of his seniority. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">For all the above reasons we donot find any ground for interference. The appeal is dismissed without any orderas to costs. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">Ed. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black"> </span></p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span> </div></div>
