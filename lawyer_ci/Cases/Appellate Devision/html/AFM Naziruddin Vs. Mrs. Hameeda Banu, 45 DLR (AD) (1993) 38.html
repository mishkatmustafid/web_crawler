Third Court, Dhaka, for a declaration that he is the irrevocable licensee of his wife, the respondent, in the 'A' schedule land and that he is the real and absolute owner of the three‑storied dwelling house and appurtenances thereto described in the 'B' schedule to the aforesaid irrevocable licence.<br/> <br/>2. Some facts are not disputed. The appellant married the respondent in 1962. Three children were ­born of the wedlock. The wife is the owner of the'  ‘A’ schedule land. The plan for the construction of the building was sanctioned in her name. The wife mortgaged the land to the Shilpa Bank of Bangladesh, the successor of the former Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan, for securing the house-building loan sanctioned by the Bank. All taxes, rates, etc. in respect of the building are assessed in her name. The husband filed the title suit on 29th August. 1980. The wife filed a suit for dissolution of marriage on 30th September, 1980. The couple lived in the house from January, 1973 till July, 1980. The husband realised Tk. 8000.00 per month from the tenants. The wife executed a power of attorney on 25th April, 1978 in favour of her husband, but that power was cancelled on 19Lh August, 1980 when the relationship between the spouses became strained. On 25th February, 1982, the wife obtained a decree of dissolution of the marriage with her husband after foregoing her dower money.<br/> <br/>3. The appellant's case is that his wife gave him possession of the land in 1967 for construction of a building and he at first built a tin‑roof there. Subsequently his wife gave him a written licence on 23rd March, 1972 by Ext. I to construct a dwelling house on the suit land. After taking loan from the Shilpa Bank and other Banks and Insurance Companies, the appellant spent about taka six lacs in constructing the three‑storied building and completed the construction by 1980.<br/> <br/>4. The respondent denied granting of any licence to the appellant. As a loan could be obtained from the Shilpa Bank at a lower rate of interest by her husband, he being an officer of that Bank, the respondent requested him to take loan, and she signed blank paper in this regard. In good faith she allowed him to look after the building of the house. She admitted that her husband drew the loan from the Shilpa Bank. She asserted that she built the house on her own by taking loan, by mortgaging the land with the Bank, and advances from her relations and her tenants. She was driven out from the house by the appellant. As she had to leave the house only with her clothes on, she could not produce any paper before the Court.<br/> <br/>5. The trial Court upheld the contentions of the appellant. After construing Ext. I as a licence and finding that the plaintiff himself constructed the house, it decreed the suit as prayed for. On appeal in FA No. 32 of 1983, the High Court Division set aside that decree and held that Ext.1 was not a licence, and that as the plaintiff knowing fully well that the land belonged to the defendant made the construction thereon, he did not acquire any title in the building or in the land. The trial Courts finding that the building was constructed by the appellant was, however, upheld.<br/> <br/>6. The appellant now contends that the High Court Division misconstrued and misinterpreted Ext. 1 when on the evidence on record it is clear that the wife in normal course of relationship gave licence to the husband to construct the building. It is asserted that in the facts of the case the licence cannot be revoked. Reliance is placed on two decisions of the Allahabad High Court. In <strong><em>Hafiz Manzoor vs. Md. Abdul AIR 1933 All. 842 </em>Sulaiman C.J.</strong> held that where the plaintiff made a construction of a permanent nature on an implied grant of a licence by the defendants section 64 of the Easements Act would not apply and the defendants would not be entitled to revoke the licence under section 60(b) of the Act. The learned Judge observed in <strong><em>Mathuri Vs.Bhola Nath AIR 194 All 517(519).</em></strong><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“When an owner of land gives permission to another person to put up a building of a permanent character and he incurs expenses in the execution of such work, the licensor is by necessary implication estopped from revoking his permission so as to prejudice the licensee whose position has been compromised in consequence. It would be inequitable, unjust and unfair to allow a licensor to order that the licensee should forthwith remove the work of a permanent character which he has put up after incurring expenditure. In such an event the transaction ceases to be a mere licence at will but may in certain circumstances amount to a license coupled with a transfer of interest or at any rate a case where the licensee acting upon the licence has executed a work of a permanent character and has incurred expenses in the execution so as to make the licence irrevocable. So long as the construction consists the right to revoke it would be in abeyance."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>7. Ext. 1 reads as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“I do hereby authorise my husband Mr, AFM Naziruddin, Manager, Loan Department of your Bank to construct a building of land on my plot bearing No. 175 (New). Elephant Road, Dhaka Mouza Dhanmondi under JL No. 724 (part) old and new No. 2053 (part) and I have no objection if any loan is sanctioned/disbursed for this purpose. Further. I declare that I have  mortgaged the said property in favour of IDBP and executed the required documents. Sd, Hameeda Banu (Mrs. Hameeda, Ranu) 23.3.72”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>8. The respondent contends that the above letter addressed to the Chief Manager of the Bank, is neither in form nor in content a license. From Ext, 3, the bye‑laws regarding house building advance by the IDBP, it appears a house building loan may be sanctioned to a confirmed employee of the IDBP for “construction of a house on a land already in his possession or in possession of his wife" provided other conditions are fulfilled. If Ext. 1 is read as a whole it will be clear that it was influenced by Ext, 3, written for facilitating the granting of a loan and never meant to be a licence. In the facts of the case the appellant's case of implied licence must fail.<br/> <br/>9. As we do not hold Ext. 1 to be a licence we need not consider the respondent's other contentions that it was not lawfully proved as to who wrote it, and it was not admissible not having been duly stamped and that at any rate the licence is deemed to, be revoked on the dissolution of the marriage when the appellant's character as the husband ceases to exist under clause (g) of section 62 of the Easements Act, 1882.<br/> <br/>10. The appellant's last contention is that after concurring with finding of the trial Court that the entire investment for the construction of the building was made by the appellant, the High Court Division ought to have granted some relief to the appellant and when it has not done so this Court the in fact of the case may do complete justice under Article 104 of the Constitution.<br/> <br/>11. Our attention has been drawn to section 17 of the Married Women's Property Act, 1882 of England, the relevant part of which is as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"In any question between husband and wife as to the title to or possession of property, either party may apply by summons or otherwise in a summary way to any judge of the High Court of Justice…………and the judge………..may make such order with respect to the property in dispute …as he thinks fit.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>12. The views in <strong><em>Hine Vs. Hine [1962] 3 AIL ER 345 </em></strong>that the above provision of law gave a free hand to do what is just, and in <strong><em>Jansen Vs. Jansen [1965] 3 All. ER 363</em></strong> that it gave rights where none existed before were disapproved in <strong><em>Pettitt Vs. Pettitt [1969] 2 All. E.R. 385</em></strong>. The House of Lords unanimously held that section 17 was procedural only and did not entitle the court to vary the existing proprietory rights of the parties. In that case the husband undertook internal decoration work, built a wardrobe, laid a lawn, constructed an ornamental wall and a side wall in the garden. Lord Reid termed those improvements as "merely of an ephemeral ­character". It was unanimously held that it was not possible to infer any common intention of the parties that the husband by expending money on the improvement of the house should acquire any beneficial proprietary interest in real property in which the whole legal and beneficial interest had previously been vested in the wife.<br/> <br/>13. <strong>Lord Reid</strong>, however, observed (pp. 390-91).<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“[If] the spouse who owns the property acquiesces in the other making the improvement in circumstances where it is reasonable to suppose that they would have agreed to some right being acquired if they had thought about the legal position. I can see nothing contrary to ordinary legal principles in holding that the spouse who makes the improvement has acquired such a right ... if a spouse provides, with the assent of the spouse who owns the house, improvements of a capital or non‑recurring nature. I do not think that it is necessary to prove an agreement before that spouse can acquire any right".</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>14. <strong>Lord Morris</strong> viewed that "there must be evidence which establishes an agreement before it can be held that one spouse has acquired a beneficial interest in property which previously belonged to the other or has a monetary claim against the other".<br/> <br/>15. <strong>Lord Diplock</strong>, however, held-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"But since husband and wife while still happily married seldom make and record any express agreement as to the title of family assets which are acquired as a result of their concerted action, this still leaves a wide area in which the court could exercise an unfettered discretion to deal with the title in whatever way it thinks just in the circumstances as they exist at the time of the courts determination which is generally after the break‑up of the marriage."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>16. These views were not shared by all the Law Lords. Soon Parliament intervened to settle the lingering controversies as to proprietory rights between husband and wife. In last two decades a number of enactments were made. Section 37 of the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act,1970 declared "that where a husband or wife contributes in money or money's worth to the improvement of real or personal property in which or in the proceeds of sale of which either or both of them has or have a beneficial interest, the husband or wife so contributing shall, if the contribution is of a substantial nature and subject to any agreement between them to the contrary express or implied, be treated as having been acquired by virtue of his or her contributing a share or an enlarged share, as the case may be, in that beneficial interest of such an extent as may have been then agreed or, in default of such agreement, as may seem in 0 the circumstances just to any court before which the question of the existence or extent of the beneficial interest of the husband or wife arises (whether in proceedings between them or in any other proceedings)".<br/> <br/>Apart from getting an acquaintance how a judge's mind worked in a particular set of facts, English decisions with regard to proprietory rights of spouses in a matrimonial home will be of no help to us.<br/> <br/>17. The question that arises in this case is that when a husband erects a building on the land knowing it to be his wife's, what right he will have against his wife with regard to the construction or the money he expended for the construction of the building?<br/> <br/>18. The English rule of considerable antiquity <em>quicquid plantuatur solo, solo cedit‑what </em>is affixed to the soil belongs to the soil‑is not applicable in ­our country. The rule itself has been modified in England by the equitable principle of proprietory estoppel and statute laws as to matrimonial home.<br/> <br/>19. In <strong><em>KK Das Vs. Amina Khatun, AIR 1940 Cal. </em>365,</strong> on which the High Court Division relied, the very English rule was applied after considering <strong><em>Thakoor Chunder Poramanick Vs. Ramdhon Bhuttacharjee. 6 Suth WR 228 (FB) and Ramsdenr Vs. Dyson [1866] LR IHL, 129</em></strong> and taking the husband's constructing the building on his wife's land knowing it to be his wife's as “an additional and special circumstance”.<br/> <br/>20. <strong>Sir Barnes Peacock</strong> said in <strong><em>6 Suth WR 228</em></strong>. "We have not been able to find in the laws or customs of this country any traces or the existence of an absolute rule of law that whatever is affixed or built on the soil becomes a part of it, and is subjected to the same rights of property as the soil itself."<br/> <br/>21. In <strong><em>Narayan Das Vs. Jatindra Nath, AIR 1927 PC 135, </em></strong>the Privy Council after citing the above statement with approval observed that "it seems to have been accepted for many years as a correct pronouncement".<br/> <br/>22. With regard to improvements, <strong>Sir Barnes Peacock</strong> observed in <strong><em>6 Suth WR 228 (FB)</em></strong>:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“We think it is clear that, according to the usages and customs of this country, buildings and other such improvements made on the land do not by the mere accident of their attachment to the soil, become the property of the owner of the soil and we think it should be laid down as a general rule that if he who makes the improvement is not a mere trespasser, but is in possession under any bonafide title or claim of title, he is entitled either to remove the materials, restoring the land to the state in which it was before the improvement was made, or to obtain compensation for the value of the building if it is allowed to remain for the benefit of the owner of the soil‑the option of taking the building, or allowing the removal of the material, remaining with the owner of the land in those cases in which the building is not taken down by the builder during the continuance of any estate he may possess."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>23. </strong>In <strong><em>Ramsden Vs. Dyson, 1866 LR I HL. 129,</em></strong> a case between landlord and tenant <strong>Lord Cranworth LC</strong> observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“If a stranger begins to build on my land supposing it to be his own, and I, perceiving his mistake, abstain from setting him right, and leave him to persevere in his error, a Court of Equity will not allow me afterwards to assert my tide to the land on which he had expended money on the supposition that the land was his own. It considers that when I saw the mistake into which he had fallen, it was my duty to be active and to state my adverse title; and that it would be dishonest of me to remain wilfully passive on such an occasion, in order afterwards to profit by the mistake which I might have prevented. But it will be observed that to raise such an equity two things are required, first, that the person expending the money supposses himself to be building on his own land: and secondly, that the real owner at the time of the expenditure knows that the land belongs to him and not to person expending the money in the belief that he is the owner. For, if a stranger builds on my land knowing it to be mine, there is no principle of equity which would prevent my claiming the land with die benefit of all the expenditure made on it. There would be nothing in my conduct, active or passive, making it inequitable in me to assert my legal rights."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>24. In a case where the trespasser had tortiously entered upon the land and built a house thereon, it was held in <strong><em>Gooroo Churan Dulta [1865] 3 WR 228</em></strong> a case referred to in <strong><em>Suth WR 228</em></strong> and not overruled, it was observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“Without going so far as to say under no circumstances could acquiescence by the party injured in the act of the injury done, be inferred, we are clearly of opinion that no such acquiescence was either pleaded or proved in the present case. We, therefore, think the plaintiff is clearly entitled as against the defendant a trespasser, to possession of his land leaving the defendant at liberty to remove the bricks of his house. (emphasis added.).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>25. In <strong><em>Narayan Vs. Bholagir Guru Mangir 6 Bom. HCRAC 80,</em></strong> <strong>Couch. CJ</strong> commented on <strong><em>Ramsden Vs. Dyson</em></strong> thus:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“We cannot, however, apply to cases arising in India the doctrine of the English law as to buildings, viz, that they should belong to the owner of the land. The only doctrine which we can apply is the doctrine established in India, that the party so building on another's land should be allowed to remove the materials.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>26. The observations noted above in <strong><em>3 WR 71 and 6 Bom. HCR A C 80</em></strong> were extracted in<em> <strong>Vallabdas Narainji Vs. Development Officer, Bandra in AIR 1929 PC 163 </strong></em>in considering the question what is meant by a mere trespasser” as contradistinguished from possession under "any bonafide title or claim of title", but the Privy Council did not give any decision.<br/> <br/>27. In a case under section 70 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, after referring to the observation of <strong>Peacock CJ</strong> in <strong><em>6 WR 228 Page CJ remarked in Seing Htaung VEA Chettyar Firm, ILR (Rangoon) 87 (91):</em></strong><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“I find it difficult myself to understand what differentiation in law can be made between a trespasser and a person <em>de facto </em>in possession but who has no title to be in possession of property, however bonafide, he may claim that he has a fide: indeed. I have difficulty, with all due deference, in apprehending what is meant by the expression "bonafide title or claim of title" as used by Sir Barnes Peacock in this connection."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>28. In <strong><em>Premji Jivan Bhate Vs. Haji Cassum Juma Ahmed, ILR 20 Bom. 298.</em></strong> it was held that the rule in <strong><em>Ramsden Vs. Dyson </em></strong>is subject, in India, to the exception that a party building on the land of another is allowed to remove the building. After noting that case in <strong><em>Abdur Razzak Vs. Nandlal Sheolal, AIR 1938 Nagpur 506</em></strong>. <strong>Stone CJ</strong> and <strong>Vivian Bose J.</strong>further observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“We must not be taken as saying that however malafide or tortious the act, there is any such right but when there is, as here, acquiescence and, as here, a bonafide belief on the part of the person building that he has fide, then if it should appear that the person building has no tide and was misled by the acquiescence, we are of the opinion that he is entitled to remove what he has built so long as he substantially returns the land in the state it was."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>29. <strong>Lord Upjohn</strong> observed in <strong><em>Pettitt Vs. Pettitt</em></strong><em>:</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“It has been settled in your Lordships’<strong><em> House Ramsden Vs. Dyson (1866) LR I HL 129</em></strong> that if A expends money on the property of B ... <em>prima facie </em>he has no claim on such property. And this as <strong>Sir William Grant MR</strong> ... held as long ago as 1810 in <strong><em>Campion Vs. Cotton [1803‑131] All. ER Rep. 580</em></strong> is equally applicable as between husband and wife. If by reason of estoppel or because the expenditure was incurred by the encouragement of the owner that such expenditure would be rewarded, the person expending the money may have some claim for monetary re‑imbursement in a purely monetary sense from the owner or even if explicitly promised to him by the owner, an interest in the land see <strong><em>Plimmer Vs. Wellington Corpn. (1884) 9 App. Cases 699.</em></strong> But the husband's claim here is to a share of the property and his money claim in his plaint is only a qualification of that. Plainly, in the absence of agreement with the wife (and none is suggested) he could have no monetary claim against her and no estoppel or mistake is suggested. So, in my opinion, he can have no charge on or interest in the wife's property."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>30. We have considered the above cases not all of them on all fours with the instant case whether the principles laid down by the Indian Courts varying relevant English rules, in cases cited above, as to a trespasser's right in certain circumstances, to claim compensation or remove what he has built on another's land can be extended to this case and the appellant can be granted any relief.<br/> <br/>31. After considering the decision in <strong><em>6 Suth WR</em></strong> <strong>228 that </strong>the building does not become the property of the owner of the soil by the mere accident of attachment, the learned Judges in <strong><em>KK Das Vs. Amina Khatun AIR 1940 Cal. 356</em></strong> held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"This proposition lends support to the view that if there be something more the building would become property of the owner of the soil. The fact that the husband constructed the building on his wife's land knowing it to be his wife's, is, in our judgment, such an additional and special circumstances. <u>The husband never intends in such a case to reserve any right in the structures. </u>He intends to make the habitation, both of himself and of his wife, more comfortable.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>32. After referring to the statement underlined above it was observed in <strong><em>Mammunhi Vs Kunhibi AIR 1961 Kerala 147:</em></strong><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“We do not understand their Lordships as having been laid down an uniform or unvarying presumption applicable to all such cases.<br/> <br/>Quite apart from this, in the absence of the maxim "whatever is affixed to the soil belongs to the soil", the question is not whether the husband intends to "reserve" any right in the structure but whether the structure passed to the wife by any process known to law, for example, by a gift or in pursuance of the arrangement under which it was put up. The plaint does not disclose any such case."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>33. No contention based on section 60 of the Easements Act, 1882 was urged in that case and nor that section though referred to was considered. In that case the land belonged to the wife who instituted the suit for eviction of the husband who constructed the house soon after the marriage, resided in the matrimonial home for over 28 years, but divorced the plaintiff about one year prior to the date of the suit.<br/> <br/>34. The instant case is similar to <strong><em>AIR 1961 Kerala 147</em></strong> and no case of gift or family arrangement is also pleaded by the respondent. The distinguishing feature of the case before us is that the wife has not yet filed any suit for eviction and the husband who is possession is claiming ownership in the building as an irrevocable licensee. In <strong><em>AIR 1940 Cal. 356</em></strong> there was no lis between the husband and the wife, and the latter was only resisting her husbands creditors.<br/> <br/>35. In a dispute between husband and wife over a matrimonial home if a view is taken considering the marital relationship alone as a special circumstance that when one spouse constructs a building on the land of the other spouse, the building will ensure to the spouse who owns the lands, then it will result in serious inequities and hardship. For example, in a case reverse to the present one, where the wife being the sole breadearner in the family builds a home on the land of her husband is later divorced and driven out from there, will have no remedy at all. We are of the view that in absence of any special circumstances the principle of equitable remedy available to a trespasser to claim compensation or remove what he has built on another's land with a bona fide belief that he has title to the land, may as well be extended to the spouse who expends money for a building on a land owned by the other spouse.<br/> <br/>36. The relief sought by a plaintiff should ordinarily be considered within the framework of his suit. In the name of complete justice this court may not grant relief which the court of first instance will not be able under law to grant, otherwise no litigant, in search of complete justice, will rest till he reaches the end of the long tunnel of litigation in this Court, the general trend among the litigants being not to accept a judgment of the trial Court without testing it on appeal or in revision in higher courts.<br/> <br/>37. Considering the vagaries of legal proceedings and the technicalities involved in adjudication, Art. 104 of the Constitution has invested as a measure of abundant caution, the last court of the country with wide power, so it may forestall a failure of justice and do complete justice in an appropriate case. It is an extraordinary procedure for doing justice for completion of or putting an end to a cause or matter pending before this Court. If a substantial justice under law and on undisputed facts can be made so that parties may not be pushed to further litigation then a recourse to the provision of Art. 104 may be justified. Complete justice may not be perfect justice, and any endeavour to attain the latter will be an act of vanity. In the name of complete justice if a frequent recourse is made to Art. 104 then this court will be exposed to the opprobrium of purveyor of "palmtree justice". Where social conditions and proprietory relations change, but the laws fail to change, they do change very slowly, the Court will even then be required to settle disputes and administer justice, and it will not ask the parties seeking justice before it to wait on Parliament for an appropriate law. In the process a "Chancellor's Foot" syndrome may occur.<br/> <br/>38. Parliament may consider that social conditions are changing. Wives are becoming earning partners. New kinds of acquisition of ownership of houses by hire-purchase, part-advance- ­part-mortgage, etc, are taking place. The rate of divorce is also increasing. Parliament may make appropriate laws so that <em>inter vivos</em> proprietary rights of a third party, if involved in the making of that home, may be settled by Court with greater case than they can possibly be done under the laws enacted more than a hundred years ago.<br/> <br/>39. After considering several factors we have overcome our initial reluctance to go beyond affirming the Appellate Court’s order of dismissal of the suit as framed. In this case the husband can, by no means, be termed as a trespasser or a stranger. He has built the house with consent, and, in the facts, it is not very difficult to hold encouragement of the wife. Because of these special circumstances, we infer a conclusion different from what was arrived at in AIR 1940 Cal. 356. Though the appellant smartly deposed that he built the house for himself and his children, there can be no gainsaying that the house was built for the benefit of the family ‑of the wife, the children and the husband as well. Though the appellant's claim on the basis of revocable licence has failed, we hold that he had reasonable belief, in the circumstances he was building the house, that he would be entitled to the building in such a way that he will not be disturbed. He has an expectation to reside in that house for the construction of which he expended about taka six acs, and he is residing there since its construction. He collected rents from the tenants and derived some benefits from the money he expended though. The respondent who obtained a decree of the dissolution of the marriage is out of possession since 1980 and she may face a protracted litigation for eviction of the appellant. If liberty is given to the appellant to remove the three‑storied building and restore the property to its original condition then it may entail serious difficulties. In view of all these, we have decided to make a rough and ready adjustment of the claims of the parties and refrain from remanding the matter to the trial Court for determination of the quantum, of compensation when the suit was not named that way nor was any evidence led as to set off or counter claim.<br/> <br/>40. Accordingly it is ordered that the appellant will retain his possession of that floor of the suit building were he is now residing with no right to transfer his possession. The respondent may recover possession there any time within one year from date on payment of Taka six lacs in default of which the appellant will have only the right to live in that floor of the suit building where he is now residing during his life Lime. With the above direction we dismiss the appeal. No costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
