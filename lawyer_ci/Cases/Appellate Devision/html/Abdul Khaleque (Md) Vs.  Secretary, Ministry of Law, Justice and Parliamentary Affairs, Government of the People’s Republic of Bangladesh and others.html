The petitioner filed AdministrativeTribunal Case No. 98 of 1989 before the Administrative Tribunal, Dhaka againstthe Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh-respondent fordeclaration that the order of compulsory retirement dated 26-11-88 passed bythe Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Law and Justice was illegal and void andalso for a declaration that he was in service. His case was that while he was aSheristader in the Court of District Judge, Patuakhali he submitted a report tothe concerned authority that Abdur Rashid Chaklader, ex-nazir of the Court ofDistrict Judge, Patuakhali, forged certified copies and misappropriated courtfees. The said Nazir was compulsorily retired from service for such offence andhe became inimical to the petitioner. Thereafter on the basis of some anonymousletters against the petitioner the learned District Judge submitted reportsboth to the Secretary, Ministry of Law and Justice against the petitioner andalso to the Registrar, Supreme Court of Bangladesh. Thereafter the petitioner wastransferred from Patuakhali to Pabna as a Sheristader. The Ministry of Law andJustice held an enquiry on the basis of such letters and the petitioner wasserved with charges to which he submitted explanation. Thereafter an enquirywas held by the Subordinate Judge of Patuakhali against the petitioner but hefound that the charge could not be established. The petitioner alleged that inspite of the said report, the petitioner was found guilty of the charges and hewas served with a second show cause notice against the proposed penalty towhich he submitted reply-pleading innocence. But by order dated 26-11-88 he wascompulsorily retired from service. His appeal against that order to theGovernment also failed. He filed a petition for review which was also rejectedon 26-02-89.Hence this case against the order of compulsory retirement from service. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">3. The Government-respondentcontested the case by filing written statement stating that for specificallegations department proceeding was started against the petitioner, anenquiry was held, charges were established and the enquiry-officer submittedreport finding the petitioner guilty of the charges. Then he was served with asecond show cause notice but his reply was found to be unsatisfactory. He wasthen compulsorily retired from service. No illegality was committed by theimpugned order. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">4. The Administrative Tribunalallowed the case by its judgment dated 13-11-93 leading to filing of Appeal No. 10 of 1994 by theGovernment before the Administrative Appellate Tribunal. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">5. The Administrative AppellateTribunal allowed the appeal, set aside the order of Administrative Tribunal andconfirmed the order of compulsorily retirement on the findings, that thepetitioner was served with a second show cause notice along with a copy of therecord of the authority’s decision, that the petitioner was not prejudiced andthat there was no violation of the principle of natural justice Thenotification upgrading the post of Sheristader came into force on 7-11-85. Thepetitioner on the basis of the Notification was allowed to continue in theup-graded post till the framing of the Recruitment  Rules on 5-9-90 and,as such, there was no scope of consultation with the Public Service Commission.The Administrative Tribunal wrongly held that the Government ought to haveconsulted with the Public Service Commission before passing the impugned order.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">6. Md. Abdus Sobhan, Advocate forthe appellant submits that Administrative Appellate Tribunal upon misreadingand misinterpretation of the written reply of the petitioner wrongly held thatthe petitioner admitted his guilt, that the finding of the AdministrativeTribunal that the charges brought against the petitioner were clearly inconflict with the findings of the Inquiry Officer were not reversed by theAdministrative Appellate Tribunal. He also submits that the petitioner heldClass-II Gagetted Post and as the Government did not consult Public ServiceCommission the Administrative Appellate Tribunal was wrong in reversing findingof the Administrative Appellate Tribunal. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">7. From the judgment and order ofAdministrative Appellate Tribunal it appears that it rightly held that, inpassing order of compulsory, retirement there was no violation of any provisionof law and consultation with the Public Service Commission was not required asthe petitioner was not up-graded till framing of the Recruitment Rule 8 on5-9-1990. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">8. We do not find any substancein the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">The petition is dismissed. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">Ed. </span></p><p><span style="color:black"> </span></p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span> </div></div>
