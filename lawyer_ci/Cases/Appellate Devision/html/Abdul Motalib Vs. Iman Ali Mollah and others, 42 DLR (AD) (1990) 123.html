The trial Court allowed pre-emption, but the lower appellate Court refused pre-emption. Both the Courts held that the question of limitation did not arise. In revision a learned Single Judge of the High Court Division, Dhaka set aside the lower appellate Court's judgment in the absence of the pre-emptee appellant in Civil Revision Case No.616 of 1984 on 16.5.85. A Re­view Petition was also dismissed on 28.7.85.<br/> <br/>2. Leave was granted to the pre-emptor appellant to consider whether notice of the Rule issued in the Civil Revisional Case was served upon the father of the appellant when the former was in death-bed re­sulting in the disposal of the revisional case in the absence of the appellant and without his knowledge.<br/> <br/>3. Leave was also granted to consider whether the trial Court ignored the provision of law in hold­ing that limitation would start from the date when me fact of registration was entered into the Registra­tion Book.<br/> <br/>4. On the question of notice, the following ev­idence of O.P.W. 1 Abdul Khaleque (father of the ap­pellant) is instructive: —<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"I am 70-75 years old, Motalib (appellant) is my son and I am looking after his property since his absence. My son is outside Bangla­desh. My son executed a power of attorney in my favour for conducting the case. This is the power of attorney signed by my son Ext. 1"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>5. The High Court Division in disposing of the review petition on 28.7.85 clearly finds that the notice of the Rule was received by the father of the appellant in his full sense by putting his signature in the return in presence of witnesses. Nothing has been shown to the High Court Division that the appellant's father was ill and senseless when he re­ceived the notice. Hence no interference is called for with the finding of the High Court Division that the appellant was aware of the Rule.<br/> <br/>6. Coming now to the second point the kabala under pre-emption was presented for registration on 26.2.76. Before it was registered under section 60 of the Registration Act the pre-emptor-respondents came to know about the sale on 16.12.76 and they filed Miscellaneous Case No. 159 of 1976 for preemption on 22.12.76. The kabala under pre-emption was registered under section 60 of the Registration Act on 13.4.78 and delivering his judgment on 5.5.82 the learned Munsif held that as registration of the kabala was entered in the Volumes on 13.4.78, the registration was complete during the pendency of the miscellaneous case and as such the question of bar of limitation did not arise. The lower appellant Court also held so.<br/> <br/>7. Mr. Asrarul Hossain, learned Counsel for the appellant, submits that a "transfer" of pre-emptable land, effected by a registered document is to take effect under section 47 of the Registration Act and in view of sub-section (3) of section 75 of the Registration Act, it shall take effect at least from 26.2.76 after its registration on 13.4.78. The miscel­laneous case having been filed on 22.12.76 is obvi­ously barred by limitation, Mr. Hossain submits.<br/> <br/>8. Mr. Abdus Salam Khan, learned Counsel for the respondents, submits, on the other hand, that it is well-established by now that the right of pre­emption accrues on not the date of execution or pres­entation of the deed for registration, but on the date of its registration under section 60 of the Registra­tion Act.<br/> <br/>9. We find that a long line of decisions of the erstwhile Dhaka High Court has followed the princi­ple that when registration is compulsory, the date of accrual of the right of pre-emption is not the date of execution of the deed of sale or any earlier date or the date of presentation for registration but the date on which the deed of sale is registered and the title effec­tively passes. The earliest case is that of Noab Mian Bhuiyan. V. Golam Hossain, 13 DLR 889. In the case of Muhammad Meher All Mondal V. Muham­mad Karam Ali Laskar, 17 DLR 365, J. Sayem (as his Lordship then was) delivering the Division Bench judgment, pronounced as follows :—<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"It is section 60 of the Registration Act which supplies the answer to the question as to when a document is considered to be regis­tered......In our view, the language of section 60 admits of no doubt that it is the certificate in compliance with the provision of this section that makes a document a registered document. The document can not be regarded as registered before the certificate is endorsed thereon and signed, sealed and dated in terms of section 60, nor has it to wait for acquiring the character of a registered document till after compliance with the other provisions that follow section 60. Their Lordships of the Privy Council having had an occasion to refer to this section in the case of Muhammad Ewaz V. Birj Lai (ILR 1 All 465) observed that, "the certificate is that which gives the document the character of a registered instrument."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>To the same effect is the case of Ajimuddin Pramanik V. Najemuddin Mondal, 17 DLR 231, Azimuddin Bhuiyan V. District Registrar, Dhaka 20 DLR 355 and Abdur Rahman V. Baser Ali, 21 DLR 599.<br/> <br/>10. It is in this light that the decision of this Division in the case of Abdur Rahman @ Abdul Rahman V. Maklis Ali, 31 DLR (AD) 118, is to be looked into. In the cited case the pre-emption case was filed on 8.8.72. The kabala under pre-emption was presented for registration on 29.7.72 and it was registered under section 60 of the Registration Act on 11.8.72. As a proposition of law the earlier deci­sions of the erstwhile Dhaka High Court were ac­cepted and it was affirmed that the cause of-action for pre-emption accrues on date of registration of the ka­bala where registration is compulsory. Also it was held that the pre-maturity of the pre-emption case was cured during its pendency.<br/> <br/>11. This Division has since followed Abdur Rahman's case in the cases of Lebu Miah V. Ganesh Chandra, 34 DLR (AD) 220 and Aftab Mia V. Wahab Ali, BCR 1982 AD 87.<br/> <br/>12. Section 47 of the Registration Act, relied upon by Mr. Asrarul Hossain, has no application. It is also well-established that section 47 of the Regis­tration Act is called in aid to decide the claims of two competing kabalas from the same vendor. It is designed to protect a vendee from the fraudulent oper­ations of a vendor. This section applies when the same vendor successively transfers the same property to different purchasers at different times. The cases of Jainullah and another Vs. Anu Miah and others, 9 DLR 258, followed by Abdur Rahman V. Baser Ali, 21 DLR 599, have long gained acceptance and the case cited by Mr. Hossain, Mir Abdul Ali V. Md. Rafiqul Islam, 40 DLR (AD) 75, is the last such case along these lines having nothing to do with accrual of right of pre-emption.<br/> <br/>13. The question of law that the right of pre­emption accrues on the date of registration of the deed of sale, when registration is compulsory, has stood the test of time and is now a stare decisis, an established precedent handed down by past judges. Mr. Asrarul Hossain submits that it takes a longer time these days, months invariably, years too, to get a document registered under section 60 after presenta­tion. Just when the pre-emptee is secure in his belief that he can relax with his ownership and possession of purchased land, arrives the notice of a pre-emption case as a rude awakening. Surely, he submits, the pre-emptor cannot be given such a long rope with which to hang the pre-emptee, after such a lapse of time. Mr. Hossain, however, hastens to add that de­lays in the application of law cannot be a ground for a different interpretation of law.<br/> <br/>14. We are thus left with no compulsive argu­ment to depart from the past and initiate a break. Difficulties complained of call for improvement in the administration of law, not a changed interpreta­tion of law.<br/> <br/>15. The trial Court and the lower appellate Court correctly decided the issue of limitation. The appeal is dismissed without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
