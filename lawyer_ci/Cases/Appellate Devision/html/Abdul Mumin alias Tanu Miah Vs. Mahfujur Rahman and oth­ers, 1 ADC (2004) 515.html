Ruhul Amin J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>These appeals, by leave, are against the order dated June 30, 1997 of a Division Bench of the High Court Division passed in Civil Order Nos. 3230, 3231, 3232, 3233 and 3234 of 1997 rejecting the 5 revisional applications summarily. The revisional appli­cations were filed against the judgment and order dated 10.4.1996 of the 1st Court of Additional District Judge, Sylhet, passed in Miscellaneous Appeal Nos. 76, 77, 78, 79 and 80 of 1994 allowing the same upon reversing the judgment and order dated August 31, 1994 in Miscellaneous Case (Preemption) Nos.179,180,181,182, and 183 of 1989 allowing the same. The Miscellaneous Cases were filed under Section 24 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949 seeking pre-emption in respect of the sale by 5 different kabalas dated 5.9.1988. The claim of pre-emption was made on the assertion that by inheritance the pre-emptor is the co-sharer of the land of lot Nos. 2183 and 2184 of khatian No. 450.<br/> <br/>2. The pre-emptor claimed to have inherited the land of khatian No. 450 from his father late Abdul Mogni and uncle Abdul Ghani who died leaving only daughter, Respondent No. 2 Farida Begum. It was the case of the pre-emptor that Farida Begum as co-sharer of the khatian in question sold parcels of land by five registered kabalas dated September 5, 1988 to Mehfuzur Rahman, the Respondent No.1 in each of the appeal. It was also averred by the pre-emptor that a suit for partition, partition Suit No. 111 of 1988, is pending before the 2nd Court of Joint District Judge, Sylhet as regard the land of kha­tian No. 450 filed by one of the co-sharers by name Abdul Karim.<br/> <br/>3. The prayer for pre-emption was opposed upon assertion that there was amicable partition of the land of khatian in question amongst the co-sharers and the pre-emptor and other co-sharers of the khatian had separated their jamas and have recorded their names in respect of their respective saham got by amicable partition in separate khatians, that the pre-emptor in respect of his share separated the jama and has got his name recorded in khatian No. 450/2 and as such pre-emptor ceased to be the co-sharer of the land of the case khatian. The pre-emptees, contended that they had effected improvement of the disputed land.<br/> <br/>4. The trial Court allowed the prayer for pre emption on the finding that the pre-emptor and the seller opposite party are co-sharers of the khatian and that pre-emptees failed to estab­lish that there had been partition of the land of khatian by the decree of the Court or by a reg­istered deed of partition. The trial Court also held that the Miscellaneous Cases were not barred by limitation and further held that open­ing of khatian No.450/1 and 450/2 do not establish that the jama of the khatian No. 450 was separated. The trial Court while allowing the prayer for pre-emption awarded Compensation of Tk. 1,00,000/- to the pre-emptees. On appeal the judgment and order of the trial Court was reversed and the Miscellaneous Cases were dismissed. The appellate Court held that upon amicable parti­tion amongst the co-sharers the pre-emptor splitting jama got his name recorded in khatian No. 450/2 and as such pre-emptor was not enti­tled to pre-empt the sale held on September 5, 1988.<br/> <br/>5. Thereupon the pre-emptor moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction. The High Court Division by common order, as stated hereinabove, rejected the revisional applications summarily upon observing "Since in the instant cases the holding in question has been separated or sub divided upon opening a new khatian at the instance of the pre-emptor, the pre-emptor ceased to be a co-sharer in the holding in question".<br/> <br/>6. Leave was granted to consider the sub­missions that the High Court Division erred in law in affirming the judgment of the appellate Court which was passed upon reversing the judgment of the trial Court without adverting to the specific finding of the trial Court to the effect that the appellant retained his status as a co-sharer in the case land in view of inheritance through his uncle despite the separation of the jama as alleged, that there having no partition of the case land between the pre-emptor and the vendor and a suit for partition, being Partition Suit No. 111 of 1988, being pending the pre-emptor did not cease to be a co sharer of the non agricultural land in question according to the principle of law enunciated in the case of S.M. Basiruddin Vs. Zahurul Islam Chowdhury and another reported in 35 DLR (AD) 230 and thus the High Court Division erred in law in reject­ing the revisional applications summarily without consideration of this aspect of the cases.<br/> <br/>7. The learned Counsel for the appellant, in all the appeals, submitted that amicable parti­tion of the land of the khatian No. 450 alleged by the pre-emptees being not partition in the eye of law and thus there being no ceasing of co-share ship in the land of the khatian by the so called amicable partition the High Court Division as well as the lower appellate Court were in error in holding that pre-emptor ceased to be a co-sharer of the land of khatian No. 450 and as such he was not entitled to seek pre-emp­tion in respect of the purchase made by the pre-emptees. The learned counsel also submitted that in fact by the opening of khatian No. 450/1 and 450/2 in the name of the heirs of late Abdul Mogni and the pre-emptor there was no separa­tion of jama or sub division of the holding as contemplated by section 117(c) of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, rather the same were up dating of the record of right i.e. khatian No. 450 as per provision of Section 143 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950. The learned Counsel continued since there was no legal partition i.e. partition by metes and bounds by the decree of the Court or by a registered instrument of partition and consequent there­upon there was no separation of title of the recorded tenants of khatian No. 450 and as by amicable partition title is not separated but only possession is separated and it being the case of the pre-emptees that there was a amicable parti­tion amongst the co-sharers of the Khatian no.450 and as thereby there had been no separa­tion of title the High Court Division as well as the appellate Court below were in error in hold­ing that pre emptor ceased to be a co sharer in respect of the land of khatian No. 450 and con­sequent thereupon in rejecting the prayer for pre-emption, that ratio decidendi of the decision reported in 35 DLR (AD) 230 being that by a legal partition co-sharer of a holding ceases to be co-sharer of the original holding and in the instant case there being no legal partition, rather a partition suit being pending, the High Court Division and the lower appellate Court were in error in rejecting the prayer for pre-emption upon holding that the pre-emptor ceased to be a co sharer in the background of the assertion made by the pre-emptees that there had been amicable partition of the land of khatian No. 450 amongst the co-sharers and that in the light of the amicable partition the pre-empor got his share recorded in khatian No. 450/2, that the ratio decidendi of the decision reported in 35 DLR (AD) 338 has no manner of application in the facts and circumstances of the instant case.<br/> <br/>8. The learned Counsel for the Respondent No.1 submitted that the very fact of opening of khatian No. 450/1 clearly shows that after ami­cable partition amongst the co-sharers of khat­ian No. 450 the heirs of late Abdul Mogni got the aforesaid Khatian opened in their names in respect of the land inherited from their father and their late uncle. Abdul Gani and that open­ing of the said khatian No. 450/1 and later on opening of khatian No. 450/2 in the name of the pre-emptor as there has been ceasing of co share ship of the heirs of late Abdul Mogni in respect of the land of khatian No. 450 the High Court Division and the Court of appeal below were quite correct in rejecting the prayer for pre­emption upon arriving at the finding that the pre-emptor ceased to be the co-sharer in respect of the land of khatian No. 450. The learned Counsel also submitted that after opening of the new khatian in the name of the pre-emptor he is claiming the land separately from the land recorded in khatian No. 450/1 and that in the light of amicable partition separate Municipal holding has been opened in respect of the land of respective co-sharers, he also submitted that the contention of the pre-emptor that since there was no legal partition or that there was no par­tition by registered instrument and consequent­ly there having no partition of the land of khat­ian No. 450 in the eye of law and that a suit for partition is being pending and as such the High Court Division and the appellate Court were not correct in holding that pre-emptor ceased to be a co sharer is no merit since the fact of opening of khatian No. 450/1 as clearly manifest there has been a partition among the co-sharers of the khatian No.450 and that the said partition was given effect by opening of the aforesaid khatian and as such as in fact there had been partition of the land of khatian No. 450 the High Court Division and the appellate Court below were quite correct in rejecting the prayer for pre­emption on the finding that pre-emptor ceased to be the co-sharer.<br/> <br/>9. One of the points for consideration where of leave has been granted is that there having been no partition of the case land between the pre-emptor and the vendor and a suit for parti­tion, being partition Suit No.111 of 1988, being pending, the pre-emptor did note case to be a co-sharer of the non-agricultural land in ques­tion in the background of the principle of law enunciated in the case reported in 35 DLR (AD) 230 and as such the High Court Division erred in law in rejecting the revisional applications without any consideration of this aspect of the case.<br/> <br/>10.  It may be mentioned the learned Counsel for the appellant placed reliance heav­ily in support of the appeal on the decisional reported in 35 DLR (AD) 30 and as against that learned Counsel for the Respondent No.1 in all the appeals, while supporting the judgment of the High Court Division placed reliance on the decision in the case of Md. Khairullah Bhuiyan Vs. Haji Nurul Alam Chowdhury, being dead his heirs Amena Khatun and others reported in 35 DLR (AD) 338.<br/> <br/>11. For appreciation of the contentions of the learned Counsels made in the light of the decisions in the aforesaid two cases facts of the same in short need by stated. In both the aforesaid cases pre-emption was sought under Section 24 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act.<br/> <br/>12. Facts of the case reported in 35 DLR (AD) 230, in short, are that the land of C.S Khatian No. 214 was owned by Akshoy Kumar Saha Banik and Rangubala Chowdhurani. Akshoy Kumar Saha Banik instituted Title Suit No. 126 of 1946 for partition and by the decree passed in the suit Akshoy Kumar Saha Banik got share and Rangubala Choudhurani got share. Akshoy Kumar Saha Banik sold his share to Nafisa Khatun by the sale deed dated 19.7.1952 and thus she became the co sharer of Rangubala. Rangubala Chowdhurani created a lease in respect of her Share in favour of Ayesha Khatun by a registered lease deed dated 23.12.1953. Nafisa Khatun sold her share to the Respondent No. 1(pre-emptor) by the sale deed dated 18.4.1972. Ayesha Khatun also sold her interest to the appellant (pre-emptees) by a reg­istered sale deed dated 10.9.1973. This sale was sought to be pre-empted claiming to be the co-sharer of the holding primarily on the plea that on the acquisition of rent receiving interest under raiyat being up graded to raiyat and there­upon only one S.A. Khatian having been pre­pared recording the names of the persons who acquired interest in the land of C.S. Khatian No. 214.<br/> <br/>13. The  prayer  for  pre-emption  was opposed contending that seller Ayesha khatun (Respondent No.2) was not a co sharer in the tenancy, because the land of the tenure was par­titioned by the decree in Title Suit No. 126 of 1946 between Akshoy Kumar and Rangubala and that a separate tenancy was created in favour of the Respondent No.2 by Rangubala by granting permanent lease reserving to herself annual rent of Tk. 1 and that Ayesha Khatun paid the rent to the lessor till the rent receiving interest was acquired by the Government. It was also the case of the pre-emptees that S.A. Khatian was not correctly prepared because nei­ther pre-emptor (Respondent No. 1) nor his ven­dor was co sharer of Respondent No.2 and that he (pre-emptees) after purchase applied for mutation of his name and accordingly his name was mutated in the S.A. Khatian and the jama was separated. The trial Court allowed the prayer for pre-emption and the appeal by the pre-emtpees was dismissed, pre-emptees went on revision before the High Court Division but did not have the desired result.<br/> <br/>14. Leave was granted to consider whether the High Court Division was correct in making no distinctions between the expression 'hold­ing' as occurring in Section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act and the expres­sion 'non-agricultural land'  as occurring in Section 24 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949.<br/> <br/>15. In support of the appeal it was argued that up gradation of an under tenant to the sta­tus of a tenant under the Government on the acquisition of rent receiving interest did not have the effect of merging the 2 distinct inter­ests i.e. of Akshoy Kumar and Rangubala on one side and that of Ayesha Khatun on the other side and that Ayesha Khatun attained the status of full tenancy on up-gradation and ceased to be the co sharer of the tenant of successor in inter­est of Akshoy Kumar and an alternative argu­ment was made that sharers of Akshoy Kumar and Rangubala having been partitioned by the decree of Civil Court in partition suit and on the creation of 2 separate Municipal holdings Akshoy kumar and Rangubala ceased to be the co-sharer of the tenancy. It was also argued that expression 'non-agricultural land' as occurring in section 24 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act not being the synonymous with the expres­sion 'holding' as occurring in Section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act the High Court Division fell into an error in treating the successor-in-interest of Akshoy Kumar as co-sharer of Ayesha Khatun and thereupon allow­ing the prayer for pre-emption.<br/> <br/>16. The Appellant Division held that though the raiyati interest vested in the Government by virtue of acquisition of the superior interests, but for that by the process of merger the under raiyat has not stood up graded to a raiyat for all purposes or in other words it can not be said "If an under raiyat become a tenant direct under the proprietor, he becomes a raiyat as his landlord who was a raiyat disap­pears from the scene". In the said case it has also been held that the expression "non-agricul­tural land" occurring in section 24 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act does not convey the same meaning as conveyed by the expression "holding" occurring in Section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act and that different sub-sections of Section 24 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act sufficiently indicate that the legislature did not use the expression 'non-agricultural land' carrying the same mean­ing as the expression 'holding' defined in State Acquisition and Tenancy Act. The expression 'non-agricultural land' may represent the entire land comprised in a tenancy or it may form a part as owned and possessed by a tenant or ten­ants on partition and is not synonymous with the word 'holding' as used in Section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act. It has fur­ther been held that the prevision of Section 24 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act as stand after amendment provides right of pre-emption only to the co-sharer tenants in the land. While allowing the appeal it was held that Respondent no. 1 not being a co-sharer in the land trans­ferred, though may be co-sharer in the tenancy, the right of pre-emption did not accrue in his favour and as such his prayer for pre emption was not entertain able.<br/> <br/>17. So it is seen from the aforesaid decision that the expression "non-agricultural land' may represent entire land comprising in a tenancy or it may form a part as owned and possessed by the tenants on partition and because of such par­tition they ceased to be co-sharer in the land possessed" by them separately and that pre-emp­tion under section 24 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act is available only to the co-sharer tenant in the land and that expression 'non-agri­cultural land"  used in section 24 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act is not synonymous with the word 'holding' as used in State Acquisition and Tenancy Act.<br/> <br/>Facts of the case reported in 35 DLR (AD) 338, in short, are that pre-emption was sought in respect of an auction sale in Certificate Case No. 408 of 1967-1968 claiming to be the co-sharers by purchase of the land of plot No. 107 and 87 of Khatian No. 14 from recorded tenant H.E. Percival by the kabala dated 29.12.1965. It was the case of the pre-emptors that their names were mutated in Khatian No. 14. It may be men­tioned H.E. Precival was the owner of the land of Khatian Nos.14, 18, 20, and 24 plot No.108 originally was listed in Khatian No.14. At one stage of the certificate proceeding the land of the aforesaid 4 Khatians were amalgamated in Khatian No. 18 comprising plot Nos.108, 116.117.119 and 121 and finally in the certifi­cate case land of Khatian No.18 was put to auc­tion and the same was purchased by the pre-emptees.<br/> <br/>18. The prayer for pre-emption was opposed contending, inter alia, that though the pre-emptors were co-sharers of Khatian No. 14 but they ceased to be the co sharers of the said Khatian while the different plots of Khatian Nos.14, 18, 20 and 24, as owned and possessed by H.E. Percival were amalgamated and consoli­dated in one Khatian, namely Khatian No.18, land of which was sold in auction and where in the pre-emptors were not co-sharers of the cer­tificate debtor. Pre-emption case was dismissed by the trial Court and on appeal the prayer for pre-emption was allowed. The pre-emptees moved the High Court Division but without any success.<br/> <br/>19. Leave was granted to examine the ques­tion whether after creation of a new tenancy by amalgamation and consolidation of holdings pre-emptors could rightly be claimed to be co-sharers of the recorded tenant H.E. Percival and also to consider the question whether a person claiming to be the co-sharer in the holding and not in the land transferred could validly main­tain an application for pre-emption under Section 24 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949.<br/> <br/>20. The Appellate Division by majority decision restored the judgment of the trial Court holding that although at one point of time the pre-emptors were the co-sharers of the Khatian No.14 by purchasing land of plot Nos.107 and 87 and plot No. 108 was in the said Khatian, but when the land of the different Khatians, i.e. Khatian Nos.18, 20, 24 as well as the land of plot No.108 of Khatian No.14 was consolidated in one Khatian i.e. in Khatian No.18, the pre-emp­tors ceased to be the co-sharers of the recorded tenant H.E Percival in respect of the land of Khatian No.18. Pre-emptors prayer for pre-emp­tion was riot allowed since on the consolidation and amalgamation of the land of H.E. Percival in a new Khatian i.e. Khatian No. 18, the pre-emptors ceased to be the co-sharers of the recorded tenant of the said Khatian. So it is seen that a tenant though at one time was the co-sharer in a particular tenancy along with the co-sharer in a particular tenancy along with the person who acquired interest subsequently in the land of the tenancy, but when the land of the original tenant or tenants of the said holding wherein purchaser-tenant(s) has no right, is list­ed in a different Khatian and thus leaving the land of the tenant (s) who became the co-sharer in the tenancy either by purchases or by some other mode(s) in the old tenancy there exists no co-share-reship in respect of the land so listed in two (2) different Khatians and as such prayer for pre-emption by one of the recorded tenant of the original tenancy is not available in respect of the land of the new tenancy or Khatian and vice-versa.<br/> <br/>21. It may be mentioned the second point in the leave was left undiscussed.<br/><br/>The admitted position in the instant case is that appellant's predecessor Abdul Mogni and appellant's uncle, Abdul Ghani along with oth­ers were the tenants of Khatian No. 450. It is the case of the pre-emtpor appellant that his uncle Abdul Ghani died leaving no male issue and as such Abdul Mogni and for that matter his heirs also inherited the property of Abdul Ghani along with his daughter. It is seen from the materials on record that heirs of Abdul Mogni some time in 1985 upon splitting up jama sep­arated their share whatever they had in plot Nos. 2180-2184 of Khatian No. 450 by opening new Khatian No. 450/1 and that later on upon splitting up the jama the appellant in the year 1995 separated his share in plot Nos. 2183 and 2184 of Khatian No. 450/1 by opening new Khatian No.450/2.<br/> <br/>22. It is the case of the pre-emptees-respondent that there has been a amicable par­tition of the land of Khatian No.450 between the heirs of Abdul Mogni and Abdul Gani. As against this it was the contention of the appel­lant that there was no partition by metes and bounds amongst the heirs of Abdul Mogni and Abdul Gani. In the background of the aforesaid contention of the appellant it has been submit­ted by the learned Counsel for the pre-emptor-appellant that in the absence of a 'legal parti­tion', that is partition by metes and bounds through a decree of a court, and in the absence of any partition by any legal instrument of par­tition there had been no separation of title, as such pre-emption sought by the appellant was very much available and that amicable partition is no partition in the eye of law.<br/> <br/>23. The learned Counsel for the pre-emptor-appellant has placed reliance on the decision reported in 35 DLR (AD) 320 in support of his submission that in the absence of legal partition, i.e. partition by metes and bounds by the decree of the court in a partition suit, or par­tition by registered or legal instruction there is no severance of title and there is also no sever­ance of possession. In the above referred case it has not been held that in the absence of legal partition that is in the absence of partition by the decree of the Court or in the absence of par­tition by legal instrument there shall be no sev­erance of possession. In the said decision tak­ing the word partition/division in general term it has been held that by partition or division of the land of the tenancy among the tenants pos­session of the tenants become separate and pre­vious joint possession of the tenants ceases.<br/> <br/>24. In the instant case it was contended from the side of the pre-emtpees-respondent that there was amicable partition of the land of Khatian No. 450 amongst the heirs of Abdul Mogni and Abdul Gani. This contention appears to be correct in the background of the fact of the opening of Khatian No. 450/1 in the name of the heirs of Abdul Mogni. In the afore­said state of the matter it is seen that jointness of possession of the land of Khatian No. 450 among the heirs of Abdul Mogni and Abdul Gani ceased. The pre-emptees purchased the land of Khatian No. 450 from the heirs of Abdul Gain. The pre-emptor prior to the transaction under pre-emption got opened separate Khat­ian, Khatian No.450/2, taking out his share from the land of Khatian No. 450/1. In our opinion in the afore state of the matter there being to jointness of possession between the pre-emptor and the pre-emptees in respect of the land of Khatian No. 450 and jointness of possession or co-sharership in the land trans­ferred being the requirement for seeking pre­emption in respect of non-agricultural land and the said legal requirement being absent in the instant case, pre-emptor's prayer for pre-emp­tion is not legally available to him.<br/> <br/>25.The finding of the trial court that by the disputed alleged separation of jama the pre-emptor in view of his inheritance from his uncle retained his status as a co-sharer in the land of Khatian No.450 appears to be not well founded in that no material has been brought is record to establish that Khatian No. 450/1 in the name of heirs of Abdul Mogni was opened only in respect of the property they inherited from Abdul Mogni or in other words in the Khatian No. 450/1 property inherited from Abdul Gani was not listed.<br/> <br/>26. As the law is now settled that pre-emp­tion under Section 24 of the Non Agricultural Tenancy Act can be sought for by a person who is a co-sharer of the land sought to be pre­empted. It has already been mentioned Abdul Mogni's heirs taking out the land whatever they inherited from Abdul Mogni and Abdul Ghani in the land of Khatian No. 450 got recorded their share in Khatian No. 450/1 with new jama on in other words upon splitting up of the original jama and this step of Abdul Mogni's heirs reflects that whatever quantity of land they got by inheritance in the land recorded in Khatian No.450 and were possessing got the same recorded in the new khatian i.e. Khatian No. 450/1. This shows said step was taken by the heirs of Abdul Mogni by the Division/partition amongst the heirs of Abdul Mogni and Abdul Gani of the land whatever they had in the said Khatian. In the background of the partition/divi­sion heirs of Abdul Mogni and Abdul Ghani brought to an end of joint possession of the land inherited by them in Khatian No. 450. It is also seen that later on the appellant whatever share he acquired in the property of Abdul Mogni and Abdul Ghani he got said share recorded in a new Khatian i.e. Khatian No. 450/2 with a new jama. This shows that whatever quantity of property he got from his father and also from Abdul Gani he got that quantity of property receded in Khatian No. 450/2. This fact demonstrates that he is in possession of the prop­erty receded in Khatian No. 450/2 and thus he ceased to be a co possessor or joint possessor of the property of Khatian No. 450. The very fact of opening of Khatian by the appellant in his name shows that he is in exclusive posses­sion of the land of his share in plot Nos. 2183 and 2184. On the opening of new Khatian No. 450/1 in the names of the heirs of Abdul Mogni comprising the land of aforesaid two plots and some other plots inherited by them from Abdul Mogni and Abdul Ghani and later on upon opening of the Khatian No. 450/2 comprising the share of appellant in plot Nos. 2183 and 2184. in other words in respect of the share which he had in the land of Khatian No. 450/1, he ceased to be a co-sharer in the land of Khat­ian No. 450, or in other words in respect of the land whatever left in the share of heirs (s) of Abdul Ghani in Khatian No.450. Thus the appellant being not the recorded tenant of Khat­ian No. 450 and that being not the co-sharer of the land as recorded in Khatian No. 450 or in other words appellant being the tenant of the tenancy as in Khatian No. 450/2 and consequent­ly not being the co-sharer of the tenancy or the land as in Khatian No.450 as such was not enti­tled to seek pre-emption of the land sought to be pre-emtped since the land so sought to be pre­empted is of Khatian No. 450. The jointeness of possession amongst the heirs of Abdul Mogni and Abdul Ghani in respect of the land on Khatian No.450 has been served by the fact of open­ing of Khatian No. 450/1 in the name of the heirs of Abdul Mogni in respect of the land which they inherited from Abdul Mogni and Abdul Gani. The opening of new Khatian in their names by the heirs of Abdul Mogni shows that they are in specific possession of the land of the plots listed in the said Khatian and further open­ing of Khatian No.450/2 with separate jama comprising land of plot Nos. 2183 and 2184 by the appellant in his name in respect of the quan­tity of land he got by inheritance out of the land of Khatian No. 450/1 shows that he is in specif­ic possession of the land of the plots listed in the said Khatian.<br/> <br/>27. The learned Counsel for the appellant has submitted that opening of Khatian No. 450/1 and Khatian No.450/2 are not in fact sep­aration of jama or creation of new tenancy with separate jama upon splitting up of tenancy of Khatian No. 450, but in fact is correction of record of right making the same up to date as contemplates by section 143 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act or in other words the learned Counsel wants to say that there is mere mutation of the names of the heirs of Abdul Mogni, The Submission so made is not well founded in that had the steps that were taken by the heirs of Abdul Mogni were in fact making the record of right up to date there was no earthly reason for starting a new Khatian with different jama i.e. Khatian No. 450/2 in the name of the heirs of Abdul Mogni and later on Khatian No. 4507 2 in the name of the appellant. In our opinion mutation of the names because of transfer or inheritance would be certainly noting down the names of the transferee (s) or the names of the heir (s) of original recorded tenant (s) in the record of right as stands at that particular moment and that not to open a sepa­rate Khatian with separate jama as in the instant case has happened. It is also seen from the record that heirs of Abdul Mogni paid rent as against the Khatian No. 450/1. This fact shows that heirs of Abdul Mogni ceased to be the ten­ants of Khatian No.450.<br/> <br/>28. In the background of the materials on record and the discussions made hereinabove it is seen that jointness of possession of the land of Khatian No.450 amongst the heirs of Abdul Mogni and Abdul Gani ceased on the opening of a Khatian No. 450/1 by the heirs of Abdul Mogni in respect of the land they got by inheri­tance from Abdul Mogni and Abdul Gani and that later on upon the opening of Khatian No. 450/2 in the name of the appellant and as in respect of non agricultural land pre-emption is available only to a non-agriculture tenant who is a co-sharer of the land so transferred i.e. co-sharership in the land transferred is the sole cri­terion for the purpose of seeking pre-emption when a part of the non-agricultural land held by a non-agricultural tenant is transferred to a stranger i.e. a person who is not a co-sharer ten­ant in the land so transferred and as in the instant case it is seen that appellant is not a co-sharer tenant in the land sought to pre-empted, as such he is not entitled to seek pre emption of the land transferred by the heir of Abdul Ghani to the pre-emptees.<br/> <br/>Accordingly all the appeals are dismissed<br/> <br/>There is no order as to cost.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>
