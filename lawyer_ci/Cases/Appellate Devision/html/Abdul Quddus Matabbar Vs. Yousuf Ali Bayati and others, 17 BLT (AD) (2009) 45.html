M. Ruhul Amin J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This appeal by leave is directed against the judgment and order dated 23.03.1999 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.3194 of 1991 making the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>2. Short facts are that the plaintiffs instituted Title Suit No.59 of 1983 in the Court of Subordinate Judge (now joint District Judge), Barguna for declaration of title to the suit land measuring 10.47 acres out of 13.14 acres of land stating, inter alia, that 14.33 acres of land recorded in C.S. Khatian No.252 of Mouza Badarkhali originally belonged to Someruddin in 10 annas 13 gondas 1 kara and 1 kranti share and Keamuddin in the remaining 5 annas 6 gondas 2 karas and 2 kranti share. Keamuddin died leaving sons, Mafizuddin, Hamejuddin and Md. Bayati and daughter Lalson Bibi and widow Maiful Bibi. All the heirs of Keamuddin except Md. Bayati and Someruddin jointly sold 13.14 acres of land to Fatik Mollah, Hachon Mollah, Yeasin Molla, Joynal Mollah and Safruddin Mollah by a registered sale deed dated 28th Chaitra, 1330 B.S, at a consideration of Tk. 1200/-. On the same date the said purchasers transferred the self same land to Someruddin, Mofizuddin Bayati and Hamejuddin Bayati by accepting two registered kabuliyats at a salami of Tk. 206/- and at a rental of Tk. 200/- and they granted dakhilas to Someruddin and others accepting rents from them and they continued to possess the said land. Thereafter Someruddin died leaving behind son Mohon Bayati who died leaving behind sons Nizamuddin Mafejuddin and Yousuf and daughters Malencha Bibi, Alekjan and Saferjan and widow Lalson. The said Yusuf is plaintiff No.1 and Alekjan is plaintiff No. 2. Then Nazemuddin died leaving daughter Rabejan and widow Surjaban and Fulson and brothers Safejuddin and Yusuf. Fulson then died leaving daughters Rabejan and Surjaban. Rabejan then died leaving sons Shahjahan, Khaleque, Sohrab and Harun and daughters Hazera and Mania Begum. The heirs of Rabejan are plaintiff Nos.10-15. Mafizuddin died leaving mother Lalson and brother Yusuf. Lalson then died leaving son Yusuf and daughter Alekjan. Malancha died leaving sons Karim and Wahed and daughters Aymon, Safora. Maiman Bibi died leaving sons Golam Kibria and daughters Pakhi Bibi, Sekani Bibi and Feroja. The heirs of Malancha are plaintiff Nos. 16-23. Safurjan died leaving husband Yunus Khan and sons Ismail and Kasem. They are plaintiff Nos.6-8. Mafejuddin died leaving son Belayet and daughter Ay son Bibi and who are plaintiff Nos.4 &amp; 5 and Hamejuddin another executant of the kabuliat is plaintiff No.3. In this way plaintiffs and others acquired 13.14 acres of land out of the C.S. Khatian No.252 and they are in possession of the said land for more than 12 years. The further case of the plaintiffs is that Md. Boyati has been in possession of 1.19 acres of land as he did not transfer his share to Fatik Mollah and others and said Md. Boyati is defendant No.4 in the suit. Land of C.S. Khatian No.252 has been recorded in S.A. Khatian Nos.439, 600,509,694 and 508. In the S.A. Khatian the suit land has been wrongly recorded in the name of the defendants who have no right, title and possession in the suit land. Hence the suit for declaration of their title.<br/> <br/>3. The defendant No.7 and 8 contested the suit by filing joint written statement and defendant No .9 contested the suit by filing a separate written statement denying the material allegations made in the plaint. Their case, in short, is that Someruddin and Keamuddin sold 13.14 acres of land by a registered kabala dated 28th Chaitra 1330 B.S. to Fatik Mollah and others but on that date the said sellers did not execute any kabuliyat in favour of buyers and the buyers did not settle the said lands to the sellers. Even if such kabuliyats were executed behind back of the buyers those were never acted upon. Fatik Molla and others after purchasing the said land got possession in the suit land and they continued in possession and after their death their heirs have been continuing in possession. The superior landlord filed Rent Suit No. 2489 of 1933 and got a decree and in execution of the said decree landlord auction purchased the land in the name of Falani Sundari wife of one of the auction purchaser landlords. The auction purchaser leased out the land to the heirs of Someruddin and others. The auction sale was set aside. In the revisional settlement the land was recorded wrongly in the name of Falani Sundari. In Certificate Case No.4221 of 1959 filed against the Surabala daughter of Faiani Sundari, one Abdul Aziz purchased the suit land after suppressing all processes. The said auction purchase was set aside by the decree passed on 31.12.1966 in Title Suit No.119 of 1965. The plaintiffs have no got right, title and interest in the suit property.<br/> <br/>4. The trial court on consideration of the materials on record dismissed the suit. On appeal being Title Appeal No. 107 of 1985 the appeal was dismissed. The plaintiffs then preferred the instant civil revisional application and the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division made the Rule absolute after setting aside the concurrent judgment and decree of dismissal of the suit by the trial court and the court of appeal.<br/> <br/>5. Leave was granted to consider the submission that the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division acted illegally in holding that the unilateral kabuliyats were admissible in evidence without calling for the original from the recipients of the same or calling for the volume from the Registration Office and the further submission   that   both   the   courts   below having concurrently found that the plaintiffs have no title and possession in the suit land, learned Judge of the High Court Division acted illegally in setting aside those findings without holding that the court below arrived at those concurrent findings by non-reading, misreading or non-consideration of the evidence on record.<br/> <br/>6. We have heard M. Shamsul Alam, the learned Counsel for the appellant and Ozair Farooq, the learned Counsel for respondent No.1 and perused the judgment of the   High connected papers.<br/> <br/>7. It is not disputed that Someruddin and Keamuddin sold 13.14 acres of land by a registered kabala dated 28th Chaitra 1330 B.S. to Fatik Mbllah and others. The plaintiffs' case is that on the same date Fatik Mollah and others transferred the said land in favour of the sellers and the sellers executed two registered kabuliyats and paid salami and rent and obtained dakhilas from the buyers and others who accepted rent and since then the plaintiffs from the time of their predecessor have been possessing the suit land. The defendants' case is that Someruddin and Keamuddin did not execute any kabuliyats in favour of Fatik Mollah and others and the buyers did not settle the said lands to the sellers and even if such kabuliyats were executed behind back of the buyers those were never acted upon. Fatik Mollah and others after purchasing the said land got possession in the suit land and after their death their heirs have been possessing the land and thereafter the superior landlord filed-Rent Suit No.2489 of 1933 and got a decree and in execution of the said decree landlord auction purchased the land in the name of Falani Sundari. The auction purchaser leased out the land in favour of the heirs of Someruddin and others. The auction sale was subsequently set aside. In Certificate Case No.4221 of 1959 filed against Surabala daughter of Falani Sundari one Abdul Aziz purchased the suit land after suppressing all processes but the said auction purchase was set aside by the decree passed on 31.12.1966 in Titje Suit No. 119 of 1965.<br/> <br/>8.  The trial court as well as the court of appeal held that on the face of the aforesaid challenge regarding the kabuliyats in question the onus was heavily upon the plaintiffs to prove that the alleged kabuliyats were actually executed by Someruddin and others in favour of Fatik Mollah and others and the latter accepted the same and those were acted upon. It appears that the plaintiffs filed certified copies of two kabuliyats dated 12.04.1924 allegedly executed by .Someruddin and others in favour of Fatik Mollah and others in respect of 13.14 acres of land out of the C.S. Khatian No. 252 but the certified copies of the kabuliyats were not formally proved in evidence, as the plaintiffs have not filed the original ones nor they called for the volume of kabuliyats from the Registry Office. Accordingly both the trial court and the court of appeal left the certified copies of the kabuliyats out of consideration, as those were not admitted in evidence in accordance with law. However, from the judgment of the trial court it appears that the trial court perused those kabuliyats and found that those were not kabuliyats creating tenancy rights rather those were Meadi Kabuliyats for 9(nine) years and those were not kabuliyats in respect of permanent settlement. Accordingly the trial court and the court of appeal held that the plaintiffs' predecessor did not acquire any permanent tenancy right in respect of 13.14 acres of land by virtue those two kabuliyats.<br/> <br/>9. Regarding the possession the courts below held that out of 24 plaintiffs none came to depose in support of their case of title and possession and instead a son of plaintiff No.1 deposed as P.W.1. The courts below further observed that plaintiffs could not produce a single dakhila granted by the landlord. The trial court and the appellate court further held that the P.W.1 could not say from how many plots the plaintiffs possess their land and what is the respective share of each of the plaintiffs in the respective plot and in cross-examination P.W.1 stated that the suit jame is ejmali land. The courts below further held that the other P.Ws also could not say the quantum of land in possession of a particular plaintiff. The courts below further held that P.W.2 in his cross-examination stated that one Md. Bayati and one Rakman Howlader possess the said land but Rakman Howlader has not been made party in the suit. So the suit is bad for defect of party.<br/> <br/>10. The trial court and the court of appeal further held that the present suit is a simple suit for declaration of title in respect of 10.47 acres of land out of 13.14 acres of land is not maintainable, as from the evidence of P.Ws it is clear that the suit land is ejmali property and without a prayer for partition the suit is barred by section 42 of Specific Relief Act. The trial court and the appellate court also taking into consideration the case of the defendants and the evidence adduced by the defendants observed that the defendants' predecessor purchased the suit land by registered kabala dated 12.04.1924 and defendant Nos.7 and 8 purchased in total 3.80 ½ acres of land from the heirs and successive heirs of the original kabala purchasers.i.e. Fatik Mollah and others by different kabala on different dates and they have filed the said kabala deeds some in original and some in certified copies which have been marked as Exts. A-A (5). The trial court and the court of appeal further observed that the contesting defendants also filed certified copy of the judgment and decree of Title Suit No.1 19 of 1965 of the 2nd Court of Subordinate Judge, (now joint District Judge), Barisal Exts. B and B (1)-and it appears that Mohammad Bayati, the son of Keamuddin was the plaintiff No.1 therein and other plaintiffs therein were the heirs and successive heirs of Fatik Mollah and his co-sharer purchasers. The trial court as well as the appellate court further held that the case of the defendants was that the landlords once auction purchased the suit land along with other lands in the benami of one Falani Sundari, wife of one of the auction purchaser landlords; but the said auction was set aside. Both the R.S. and S.A. Khatians were prepared in the name of Falani Sundari. Abdul Aziz and another taking advantage of the wrong record in the name of Falani Sundari caused the land to be put in certificate sale showing only one of the daughters of Falani Sundari as judgment debtor in the said certificate case. The defendants instituted Title Suit No. 119 of 1965 in the 2nd Court of Subordinate Judge (now joint District Judge), Barisal and in the suit it was held that the auction sale in certificate case was void, collusive and not binding upon the plaintiffs.<br/> <br/>11. The High Court Division it appears reversed the findings of the appellate court and the trial court without adverting to the reasonings given by the court of appeal which is final court of fact. The High Court Division also found fault with the courts below for not taking into evidence the certified copies of the Kabuliyats alleged to have been executed by the predecessors of the plaintiffs although the originals were, neither produced nor called for nor the volume from the Registrar's Office was called for. The High Court Division further held that certified copies of the kabuliyats, the originals of which were not called for nor produced were admissible in evidence as public documents. We are constrained to observe that the findings of the High Court Division are not at all based on the materials on record regarding title and possession of the plaintiffs in the suit land and the findings of the High Court Division that the certified copies of the kabuliyats without calling for, the originals or the volume from the office of the Registrar is admissible in evidence is not the correct proposition of law. Accordingly we hold that the impugned judgment is not a proper judgment of reversal. In this connection we also like to observe that the findings of the court of appeal on question of fact is binding upon the High Court Division unless it can be shown that those findings are perverse. In the instant case there is no such finding by the High Court Division regarding the findings of the court of appeal on question of fact.<br/> <br/>Accordingly the appeal is allowed with, costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
