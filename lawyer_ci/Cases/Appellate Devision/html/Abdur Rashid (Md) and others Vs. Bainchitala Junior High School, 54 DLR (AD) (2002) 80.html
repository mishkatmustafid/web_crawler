Ruhul Amin J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This petition for leave to appeal has been preferred against the judgment and order dated 2nd March, 1997 of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 1751 of 1995 discharging the Rule which was obtained the against the order No. 15 dated 22nd February, 1995 of the learned District Judge, Jhenaidha in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 54 of 1985 allowing an application under Order 1 rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) and thereby adding one Khandaker Moulana Meshbahul Alam Azad Khandani as appellant in the miscellaneous appeal pending before the Court of District Judge.<br/> <br/>2. Facts, in short, are that petitioner herein filed Title Suit No. 16 of 1981 (previously numbered as Title Suit No. 26 of 1979 of the Court of Subordinate Judge, Jessore) of the Court of Subordinate Judge, Jhenidha seeking declaration that he is the successor of the defendant Bainchitala Islamia Junior Madrasah and for a further declaration of title to the land described in the schedule appended to the plaint. The suit was decreed ex parte on 20th November, 1982, Defendant Nos. 6 and 7 (Badaruddin Mandal) of the aforementioned suit filed an application under Order IX rule 13 CPC for setting aside of the ex parte decree and thereupon Miscellaneous Case No. 76 of 1982 was registered. The said Miscellaneous case was ultimately dismissed on 23rd April 1985. As against the order of dismissal defendant No.7  preferred Miscellaneous Appeal No. 54 of 1985 before the Court of District Judge and therein one Khandaker Moulana Meshbahul Alam Azad Khandani filed an application under Order I rule 10 CPC claiming himself as Secretary of the Madrasah for being added as appellant in the miscellaneous appeal and the said application was allowed and as against that Revisional application was moved a Rule was obtained, Civil Revision No. 216/85 (Jessore)/ 3602/91 (Dhaka) and finally, the Rule was rule was made absolute on 2nd August, 1994. It may be mentioned during the pendency of the civil revision defendant No. 7 Badaruddin Mandal who was the appellant in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 54 of 1985 died on 22nd December, 1992. That on receipt of the record from the High Court Division the same was shown to the learned Advocate of the defendant-appellant on 8th January, 1995 and an application under Order I rule 10 read with section 151 of the CPC was filed on 22nd February, 1995 seeking addition of the heirs of Badaruddin Mandal as appellants in the Miscellaneous Appeal No. 54 of 1985 and the said application was allowed on 22nd February, 1995. As against the said order plaintiff respondent in the miscellaneous case moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained the present Rule contending that as no estate has been left by Badaruddin to which the petitioners can be considered to have succeeded on his death and consequently, they do not come within the ambit of legal representative as contemplated by the provision of Rule 4 of Order XXII of the CPC.<br/> <br/>3. It may be mentioned that defendant No. 7 Badaruddin in his application under Order IX rule 13 of the CPC stated that he was entrusted by the Madrasah to manage its property. It was also stated in the application under Order I rule 10 that Badaruddin was a bargader of the land in suit under the Madrasah and that after death of their father petitioners have taken bargader of the land in suit from the Madrasa.<br/> <br/>4. In the background of the aforesaid facts the High Court Division upon observing even if the facts as stated by the petitioners in assertion of their right to be added as parties (appellants) in the appeal were taken to be correct “then also they cannot be added as parties in the instant suit because they have no independent right to call in question the legality and propriety of the decree passed in Title Suit No. 16 of 1981 wherein they were not parties”.<br/> <br/>5. Be it an application under Order I rule 10 of the Code or an application for substitution under Order XXII rule 4 of the Code, the opposite parties must show that they have inherited the estate left by their deceased father, but it is clear from the assertion made by both deceased Badaruddin in his application under Order IX rule 13 (If the Code of Civil Procedure and the present opposite parties in their application under Order I Rule 10 the Code that no estate has been left by their father to which they have succeeded on his death. Thus, they do not come within the ambit of legal representative as contemplated in rule 4 of Order XXII of the Code.”<br/> <br/>6. In the instant case admittedly the suit property is not the personal property of deceased Badaruddin and it did never belong to him. So, no question of inheritance does arise in respect of the suit land by the opposite parties as heirs of deceased Badaruddin. In that view of the matter the application filed by them can neither be allowed under Order I rule 10 or under Order XXII, rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the learned appellate Court below, misdirecting himself on a total misconception of law and facts erroneously allowed the application filed by the opposite parties for adding them as appellants in the Miscellaneous Appeal No. 54 of 1985 made the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>7. As against the order of the High Court Division dated 22nd March, 1997 making the Rule absolute and thereby rejecting the present petitioners’ application under Order I rule 10 read with section 151 CPC for being added as appellants in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 54 of 1985 of the court of District Judge, Jhenidah this leave petition has been filed.<br/> <br/>8. Mr. Md. Aftab Hossain, learned Advocate- on-Record for the petitioners, submits that Badaruddin, predecessor of the petitioners, as was impleaded in suit and that on the death of Badaruddin as the petitioners are the bargader of the land in suit and in the background of the aforesaid facts the petitioners were being the necessary and proper parties in the suit as well as in the miscellaneous appeal the High Court Division was in error in rejecting the petitioners’ application filed under Order I rule 10 read with section 151 CPC.<br/> <br/>9. It is seen from the judgment of the High Court Division that Badaruddin in his application fled under Order IX rule 13 stated that Madrasah entrusted the management of the property in suit to him but Badaruddin’s heirs, petitioners herein, in their application under Order I rule 10 read with section 151 CPC in support of their claim of being aided as appellant in the miscellaneous appeal  stated that their father was a bargader of the land in suit and that after him they are the bargaders in the land in suit.<br/> <br/>10. In the background of the facts stated by petitioner’s father in the petition filed under Order IX rule 13 CPC and the petitioners herein in their petition filed under Order I rule 10 read with section 151 CPC the High Court Division arrived at the finding “that no Estate has been left by their father to which they have succeeded on his death. Thus they do not come within the ambit of legal representative as contemplated in rule 4 or Order XXII of the Code.”<br/> <br/>In the light of the undisputed facts of the instant case we are of the view that there is no infirmity in the finding made by the High Court Division as to petitioners not being legal representative of defendant No. 7 in respect of the subject matter of the suit. The learned Advocate-on-Record for the petitioners could not point out any error or infirmity in the judgment of the High Court Division in any respect.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
