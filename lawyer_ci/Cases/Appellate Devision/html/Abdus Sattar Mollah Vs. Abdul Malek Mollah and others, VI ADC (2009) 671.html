The facts of the case, in short, are that one Abbas Sheikh was the original owner of the suit land after his death heirs son Amiruddin, Zainuddin and daughter Banu Khatun inherited the suit land. Thereafter, Zainuddin and Banu Khatun died leaving behind their only full brother Amiruddin and thus, Amiruddin became the owner to the extent of 16 anneas share. The R.S record was prepared in the names of the aforesaid persons for the whole suit land. Thereafter, in 1359 B.S. the said present petitioner, who is lying thereto by constructing dwelling house thereon. But due to business purpose, the plaintiff does not stay at home. During the operation of the S.A. record, one Abdullah was entrusted with the duty to record the name of the petitioner in the S.A. record. Thereafter, the death of the said Abdullah, the duty was entrusted upon one Sattar. Thereafter, in 1397 B.S. the plaintiff came to know that the S.A. record was wrongly prepared in the name of the defendant No.1 in spite of the fact that the same is in his exclusive possession. Due to such wrong record, title of the plaintiff having been clouded filed the suit for declaration of his title over the suit land.<br/> <br/>3. The defendant Nos.1-13 contested the suit by filing written statement denying all the materials allegations made in the plaint contending, inter alia, that Aiyanuddin and Moniruddin were the owners of the suit land. They being in right, title and possession transferred the suit land to Abdullah and Monaulla and Abdulla transferred 1.68 acres of land to Entaz and Aminuddin by way of lease patta and also delivered the possession thereof. Thereafter, Entaz transferred his share to the defendant by way of a sale deed. Thereafter, Sona Ulla transferred 0.12 acre of land to the defendants. The defendants got 1.83 acres of land. Thereafter, S.A. record was prepared in the name of the defendants in respect of 1.54 acres of land instead of 1.83 acres of land. Thereafter, 61 decimals of land was transferred to the defendant No. 25 and 26 respectively. Some portion of the suit land was transferred to one Abdul Hakim and S.A. record also was prepared in his name. Though R.S. record was prepared in the name of Aminuddin but he did not possess the suit land. The said Aminuddin did not transfer the suit land to the plaintiff by way of a lease as alleged. Thereafter, on Abdulla's death his heirs transferred 0.04 acres of land to the plaintiff and in this manner, the present survey record has been prepared in the name of the defen­dants and accordingly, prayed for dis­missal of the suit.<br/> <br/>4. Mr. Abdul Halim Chaklader, Counsel, appearing for the petitioner sub­mitted that both the Courts below rightly and lawfully passed the judgments and decrees in favour of the petitioner on the basis of materials on record as well as evi­dence. The findings of the trial Court was that<br/> <br/>"এই পি.ডব্লিঊ-২ আমীরউদ্দিনের বা বাদীর আমলনামার দাতার পুত্র হিসাবে স্বাক্ষ্য প্রদান করিয়াছেন। শেই হিসাবে এই স্বাক্ষীর দাখিল আমলনামার উপর পরিস্কার বক্তব্য প্রদান করার কথাকিন্তু তিনি শেই মর্মে পরিস্কার কোন বক্তব্য প্রদান করিতে পারেন নাই।" But both the High Court Division and this Division ignoring this vital points for this arguable case arrived at a wrong finding. And "কেননা দীর্ঘ ৪০/৪২ বছরের পুরাতন আমলনামা ও দাখিলা এতটা ঝকঝকে থাকার কথা নহে এবং সেই জন্যই অনুমান করা যায় যে ঊল্লেখিত কাগজাদি অত্র মামলার প্রয়জনে একই বৈঠকে একই কালি দারা সৃস্টি করা হয়েছে”। From the above findings it is clear that this opposite party fraudulently created the forged Amalnama and Dhakhila but both the High Court Division and this Division failed to con­sider the important issue. The learned Counsel further submitted that a finding of fact whether concurrent or not arrived at by the Court of Appeal below, is binding upon the High Court Division except in certain well defined circumstances, such as, non-consideration or misreading of the material evidence affecting the merit of the case, the High Court Division ignoring the well settle principle and arrived at a erroneous decision of the case and this Division also ignoring the merit of the case arrived at a wrong finding which require reconsideration; that the Court of Appeal's finding was that 'the opposite party' namely Malek himself as P.W.1 did not claim any exclusive possession in his deposition but stated that he built a home­stead wherein he had been living. Malek failed to say plots and area of lands in the cross examination.' And from the above facts and findings it is palpably clear that the petitioner has exclusive in possession of the suit land.<br/> <br/>5. The aforesaid submissions of the learned Counsel are touching the merit of the case which the High Court Division arrived at on consideration of the evidence and circumstances of the case and duly affirmed by this Court.<br/> <br/>6.  In view of the above, we find no sub­stance in the submission of the learned Counsel for the petitioner.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>
