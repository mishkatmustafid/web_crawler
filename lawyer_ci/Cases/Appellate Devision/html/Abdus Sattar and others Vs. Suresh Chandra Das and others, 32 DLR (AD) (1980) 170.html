The other question of law involved will be dealt with at its appropriate place.<br/> <br/>2. Facts, in brief, are that the appellants as plaintiff landlords instituted a Small Cause Courts suit for ejectment of Respondents. Their case for ejectment is that Balaram, father of Respondents, was a monthly tenant at the premises in 1968 and from April, 1969, Suresh, the first Respondent took the tenancy in his name, and he having defaulted in payment of rent was liable to ejectment. The second Respondent, brother of Suresh, was added as a party to the suit on the objection of Respondent as he was also residing in the premises and was said to be in permissive possession. Plaintiffs asserted that both were liable to ejectment. The de­fence, in substance, apart from other grounds not relevant for this appeal, was that the tenan­cy was in favour of Balaram, and on his death it has devolved upon both the respondents as his heirs and so the notice to quit u/s. 106 of the first Respondent was insufficient.<br/> <br/>3. The trial Court on consideration of evidence, both oral and documentary, accep­ted the plaint case that Balaram was the first tenant, thereafter from 1969 first Respondent became tenant as evidenced by Ext. 3 series and he did not make payment after October, 1969 and was a defaulter. The second Res­pondent was in possession as the brother of Suresh but not as a tenant. He, therefore, decreed the suit for ejectment. On revision by the Respondents, the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division reversed the find­ings of the trial Court, and held that the tena­ncy was only in favour of Balaram and on his death it devolved on his sons, the Respondents and so the notice to quit on Suresh was insu­fficient. He made the rule absolute and set aside the decree of the trial Court.<br/> <br/>4. Leave was granted to consider two questions, one of which has already been set out at the very beginning. Both the questions may be set out as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">1. Whether the High Court Division was well founded in law in holding that a monthly tenancy under the Transfer of Property Act is heritable.<br/>2. Whether upon a correct principle of law the learned Single Judge reversed the finding of fact u/s 25 of the Pro­vincial Small Cause Courts Act as to the creation of tenancy in favour of first Respondent.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>5. Considering the importance of the questions, after hearing the learned Counsel, Mr. Khandker Mahbuddin Ahmed for the Appellants, and Mr. Salam for the Respon­dents, we thought it proper to call Mr. S.R. Pal as amicus curiae to assist the Court. We have had the opportunity of hearing the learned Counsels and their learned arguments have helped us in coming to our conclusion in this appeal. We, however, refrain from dealing separately with the submissions of each of the learned Counsels on the question.<br/> <br/>6. Since the question will not take as long, we propose to deal with it first. It is now well settled that a revision under' section 25 of the Small Cause Courts Act lies if there is an error of law involved in the decision of the trial Court. A revision is available with a wider scope than that under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure. They are now well settled and require no further elaboration. What is to be seen is whether the learned Judge of the High Court Division has applied the correct principle in interfering with the decision of the trial Court under section 25 of the said Act. First of all, he is to come to a finding the decision of the Court below suffers from an error of law, and then to see whether the error of law has vitiated its decision, and on so finding, he can proceed to reverse the decision of the trial Court. Keeping this principle in view, we are to judge the finding of the learned Single Judge regarding the reversal of the finding of the trial Court on the question of creation of tenancy in favour of Respondent 1. It is to be remembered that both the Courts below have accepted the creation of tenancy in 1968 in favour of Balaram, the father of the Respondents. Where the two Courts di­ffered is on the creation of tenancy in favour of Respondent 1. According to the trial Court, tenancy was created in his favour in 1969 and this he based on a reference to Ext. 3 series the rent receipts. This finding was reversed by the learned Single Judge making a bare obser­vation that it was clear from the pleadings of the parties and the evidence that the tenancy of Balaram was created on 1.1.68 and that the tenancy devolved upon his death on his heirs. The question is whether this finding is in accordance with the provisions of section 25 of the Small Cause Courts Act. Plainly it is not. The learned Judge has not shown what was the error in the appreciation of evidence by the trial Court in its finding which could be termed as an error of law, which would give the High Court Division an authority under the Act to interfere. The approach of the lear­ned Judge was as if he was dealing with a first appeal on fact and not a revision under section 25 of the said Act. No error of law was pointed out by him, nor do we find any such error in the finding of the trial Court. The trial Court from evidence drew a conclu­sion of fact which the learned Judge reversed without pointing out any error of law. He merely drew a second conclusion of fact which section 25 of the said Act does not authorize him to do. In this view of the matter the reversal of finding of fact by the learned Judge on this point cannot be sustained and must be set aside. The finding of the trial Court that a tenancy was created in favour of Res­pondent 1 on the death of Balaram, his father, must be upheld. In view of this finding, the first question loses much of its importance but since a question of law of public importa­nce is involved, we proceed to deal with it.<br/> <br/>7. From the facts on record we find that there was no written contract between the plaintiff's on the one hand and Balaram or Respondent 1 on the other, and the tenancy was created on the mere payment of rent be­tween the landlord and tenant. A tenancy of this nature is legal and valid in terms of sec­tion 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. It has been termed to be a lease or tenancy from month to month terminable on the part of either party by fifteen days notice expiring at the end of a month of the tenancy. The section also refers to certain agricultural and manu­facturing leases, but we are not concerned with them in this appeal.<br/> <br/>8. It is further to be remembered that this monthly tenancy is also the subject of Bang­ladesh Premises Rent Control Ordinance, where, notwithstanding the provisions of Transfer of Property Act and Contract Act, wide-ranging provisions have been introduced encroaching upon the rights of the parties. But, in view of the question of law involved in this appeal, a detailed discussion of the Rent Control Ordinance need not be looked into as the Ordinance chiefly deals with the protection of the tenant from ejectment so long as he pays rent in terms of the Ordinance and with some other incidents of the tenancy but does not deal with the heritability of the tenancy. We only want to refer to the definition of 'tenant' given in the Ordinance. The Ordina­nce says, a tenant means a person by whom, or on whose account, rent is payable for any premises, and includes a legal representative as defined in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, and a person continuing in possession after the termination of a tenancy in his favour. A glance at the definition along with the de­finition of 'landlord', which is noting but the counterpart of the tenant, indicates that the definition was inserted in the Ordinance only to emphasize the tenant's liability to pay rent and nothing more, and this meaning becomes clear when we advert to the second half of the definition of 'tenant,' which says that it also includes a person continuing in possession after the termination of his tenancy. In this view of the matter, we are not called upon to dilate on this Ordinance any further.<br/> <br/>9. At the outset, it is to be observed that learned arguments have been advanced from the Bar on the English rule of the tenancy-at-will which is created where lands or tenements are let out by one man to another to have and to hold to him at the will of the lessor, by force of which lease, the lessee is in possession. A tenancy-at-will is determinable at the will of either landlord or tenant and is a personal relation between the original landlord and the tenant and is determined by the death of either of them. Whereas, the relationship between the landlord and tenant created under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act has been ter­med a lease from month to month, termina­ble on the part of either party by fifteen day's notice expiring at the end of a month of ten­ancy. The section, in a restricted sense, des­cribes the tenancy as a lease. The difference between the two is also patently manifest that no fruitful purpose will be served in discussing the subject any further.<br/> <br/>10. In order to grasp the problem before us, we are to see the character of tenancy that created under the provisions of section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. This section is a specie of a rider to the princi­ple section which is section 105, and which defines what a lease is, section 105 says that a lease of immovable property is a transfer of a right to enjoy such property, made for a certain time, express or implied, or in perpe­tuity, in consideration of a price paid or pro­mised, or of money, as hare of crops, service or any other thing of value, to be rendered periodically for or on specified occasions to the transferor by the transferee who accepts the transfer on such term. Now if we analyse the essential elements constituting a lease, we find the following elements: (a) the right must be one as to immovable property; (b) the right must be that of enjoyment of immo­vable property; (c) there must be a transfer of such right; (d) the right of transfer is an interest in property; (e) the transfer be made for a certain time express or implied, or in perpetuity ; the transfer must be one for consideration; (g) the consideration must be of the particular kind mentioned in the section, namely, premium or rent, as defined by the section, either or both of them.<br/> <br/>11. The lease, as defined, no doubt creates an interest in immovable property and the Act also says that it is transferable, but the Act is silent on its heritability. I will depend of course, upon the interest created by the lease and so, we are to see the true chara­cter of the lease created under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act.<br/> <br/>12. Under section 106 of the Act, the lease contemplated, among others, is a lease or tenancy from month to month and is terminable by either party giving fifteen days notice expiring at the end of a month of the tenancy. A glance at the elements constitu­ting lease under section 105 set out above reveals that all them are not present in a lease under section 106, nevertheless, it has been termed to be a lease under this section. An analysis of the elements constituting a lease along with a comparison of the two sections indicates that the lease coining under section 106 cannot be treated as a lease under section 105, having all its incidents.<br/> <br/>13. Let us, therefore, consider what in­terest is created by the lease under section 106. The section says that the lease will be from month to month. No doubt this lease is for the occupation of the premises by the tenant which is terminable at the option of either party on giving fifteen days notice expiring at the end of a month of the tenancy. The termination of the tenancy, of course, cannot take effect unless the notice to quit under this section has been served by one or the other, and the statutory period had expired. Analysing in this way, we find that a relationship is created under this sec­tion between the landlord and the tenant which is of a personal nature. The right of occupation of the premises has been given and this right of occupation from month to month from its very nature cannot but be personal and so cannot create an interest in the land as a lease under section 105 does. The right of occupation remains personal with the tenant. The right being personal it ceases with the death of either party and so on the death of the tenant, the tenancy ceases and hence it is not heritable.<br/> <br/>14. Since some interest is created, even though personal, by the monthly tenancy, which may not be, to borrow an English concept, an estate in favour of the tenant, nevertheless the heirs or successors-in-interest of a tenant in occupation of the premises on his death do not become trespassers, be­cause neither their predecessor nor they entered the premises wrongfully, and so their continuance in the premises will be that of a tenant by sufferance to borrow again another English concept. It is to be noted that ten­ancy by sufferance arises by implication of law and cannot be created by a contract between the parties. Such interest cannot be assigned or conveyed and is in fact a mere invention of law to prevent the' continuance of possession acting as a trespass. Such a tenant may be ejected at any time without demand of possession. If, however, the landlord assents or receives rent, he becomes a tenant in terms of section 106, as his predecessor was; with all the incidents of a tenancy under that section.<br/> <br/>15. In our view, the construction we have given on section 106 of the Act will obviate serious complications which would otherwise originate if we treat a monthly tenancy under section 106 as full fledged lease of pro­perty and so heritable. To illustrate, if it is heritable, then, according to the personal law of the tenant, it will be inherited by the whole group of heirs contemplated therein, sons, daughters, wife, other kinds etc. and all of them becoming tenants, some of them may not be occupying the premises at all. Nonetheless, they will become liable to future rent and will be entitled to receive the notice to quit. Likewise, the landlord will be faced with an insurmountable problem of ejecting those innumerable "tenants by inheritance", many of whom might not be known to him. He would also be faced with the immense di­fficulty of serving the notice to quit on all of them.<br/> <br/>16. Then again, under what principle this right is made available to the heirs? The original tenant himself did not enjoy more than a mere right of occupation on payment of rent was liable to be ejected on fifteen days notice. How this uncertain, if not pre­carious right of occupation, can become an estate to be inherited by persons who have never occupied the premises? It is a proposi­tion which is untenable; In that event the tenant having the bare right of occupation will leave after his death a higher right to his heirs in the tenancy, which he never had. The heirs will become tenants without occu­pying or using the premises. This cannot be contemplated because in that event heirs will inherit a right higher than that of their predecessor.<br/> <br/>17. The view we have taken is in accord, with the true intent of section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. In this view, the decision in the case of Gouribala Pal vs. Kunjalal Saha (1960) 12 DLR 37 where a Single Judge of the Dacca High Court has, rely­ing on an earlier Calcutta decision in the case of Anwarali Bepari vs. Jamini Lal Ray Chowdhury 43 CWN 197, held that upon the death of an original tenant in respect of an immovable property, the tenancy being one from month to month, does not cease to exist and the heirs and legal representatives of the original tenant do not become trespassers but having continued in possession as heirs, they become tenants by holding over, cannot be sustained. The view taken in the Calcutta de­cision was that there was no reason why a tenant from month to month should not be heritable. For the reasons we have already given, we find it difficult to concur with the view expressed in this decision.<br/> <br/>18. We, therefore, conclude that on the death of the tenant a tenancy from month to month does not become heritable. The finding of the learned Judge of the High Court Division that upon the death of Balaram, the tenancy was inherited by his two sons can­not, therefore, be sustained. For the reasons, we set aside the decision of the High<br/>Court Division and restore that of the trial Court.<br/> <br/>The appeal is allowed with costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
