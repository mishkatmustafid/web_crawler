Ruhul Amin J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment dated May 11, 2005 of a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 749 of 1996 making absolute the Rule upon setting aside the judgment and decree dated January 22, 1996 of the 3rd Court of Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge) and Artha Rin Adalat, Chittagong in Other Appeal No. 462 of 1993 allowing the same upon reversing the judgment and decree dated September 28, 1993 of the 2nd Court of Additional Senior Assistant Judge, Sadar, Chittagong in Other Case No. 155 of 1990 dismissing the same.<br/> <br/>2. The suit was filed seeking separate saham of 34 decimals of land on partition of 1.14 acres of land. The appellate Court upon allowing the appeal passed a decree in favour of the plaintiff allotting separate saham for 34 decimals of land from the land described in the schedule attached to the plaint.<br/> <br/>3. It was the case of the plaintiff that the land described in the schedule belonged to Hakim Jan Bibi and Abdul Ali in equal share who acquired the same by the regis­tered patta dated February 17, 1902, that Hakim Jan Bibi after the death of her hus­band married Amir Hossain, that Hakim Jan Bibi gifted 12 gandas of land out of her share from the land of the patta dated February 17, 1902 to her son Jebal Hossain by the 2nd husband, that the gift was made by the registered deed of gift dated June 25, 1928, that possession of the land so gifted was made over to Jebal Hossain who built his homestead in the said gifted land and was living there, that Hakim Jan Bibi died leaving 4 sons of whom 3 were by her first husband and another by her second husband and 2 daughters by her 2nd husband, that Jebal Hossain died leaving plaintiff Nos.1-3 as sons and plaintiff No.4 as daughter, that Hakim Jan Bibi's daughter Sundar Bibi (by second husband) died leaving defen­dant No. 17 as her heir, that land left by Hakim Jan Bibi's first husband and by Hakim Jan Bibi devolved upon by the successive heirs.<br/> <br/>4. It was the case of the plaintiffs that their predecessor got 12 gandas of land by gift and 5 gandas of land by inheritance and thus inherited 17 gandas of land i.e. 34 decimals of land, that as Jebal Hossain at the time of preparation of R.S. record was in Burma his step brothers got the R.S. record prepared in their names showing share to the extent of 7 annas each and showing share of Hakim Jan Bibi to the extent of 2 annas, that the R.S. record so prepared was wrong, that after the death of Hakim Jan Bibi her son Jebal Hossain was in possession of the land got by gift and by inheritance and that after the death of Jebal Hossain plaintiffs are in posses­sion of their land in ejmali with the other co-sharers, that plaintiffs requested the defendants for partition of the land in suit but they denied. Hence the suit.<br/> <br/>5. The suit was contested by defendant No.1 denying  the  material  averments made in the plaint and contending that the suit as framed is not maintainable and the same is bad for defect of party and that in the absence of seeking declaration of title and recovery of possession the suit is not maintainable. The specific case of the defendant was that the land in suit belonged to Omar Ali who died leaving 2 sons by name Moqbul Ali and Abdul Ali and a widow Hakim Jan Bibi, that C.S. record was prepared in their names, that the patta dated February 17, 1902 and the deed of gift dated September 25, 1928 by Hakim Jan Bibi in favour of Jebal Hossain are fictitious documents and that Jebal Hossain never built homestead in the land in suit, that R.S. record was correctly pre­pared and that Hakim Jan Bibi had only 1/8th share in the land described in the schedule and that the plaintiffs are entitled to 1/16th share in the land for the partition whereof suit for partition has been filed.<br/> <br/>6.  The trial Court dismissed the suit with the findings that the plaintiffs failed to prove the patta on the basis of which they are claiming the land in suit and that plaintiff being the heir of Hakim Jan Bibi they are entitled to the extent of the share in the land left by Hakim Jan Bibi, that the suit was bad for defect of party since the co-sharers of the land in suit have not been made party and as such the suit is bad for defect of party.<br/> <br/>7.  On appeal the appellate Court decreed the suit on the findings that Jebal Hossain acquired title in the land in suit on the basis of the deed of gift and that record of right was prepared upon leaving out the names of the heirs of Jebal Hossain and Hakim Jan Bibi. As against the judgment of the appellate Court the heirs of the defendant No. 1 moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained Rule.<br/> <br/>8. The High Court Division made upon modification, the Rule absolute on the finding that the patta on the basis of which plaintiffs' predecessor Hakim Jan Bibi said to have acquired 8 annas share in the land in suit is in the name of Abdul AH who happens to be one of the sons of Omar Ali who died leaving Abdul Ali and another son Moqbul Ali and widow Hakim Jan Bibi and in that state of the matter R.S. record was prepared showing 2 annas share in the name of Hakim Jan Bibi and 7 annas in the names of each of the sons of Omar Ali, that although plain­tiff contended that R.S. record was wrong but they failed to establish their said con­tention or in other words failed to revert the presumption of the correctness of the record as available under Section 103B of the Bengal Tenancy Act, that the patta as claimed by the plaintiffs in support of their claim in the land in suit in fact stands in the name of Abdul Ali alone and in the background of the facts and the materials brought on record the same was not acted upon, that the appellate Court was wrong in holding on the basis for of noting about the patta in the R.S. record that Hakim Jan Bibi had the 8annas share of the land of the said patta, although patta which has been marked as Ext. “Uma” as well as Ext. 8 clearly shows patta dated January 17, 1902 is in the name of Abdul Ali alone, that the case of the defendant is that the land in suit belonged to Omar Ali who died leaving 2 sons, Abdul Ali and Moqbul Ali and a widow Hakim Jan Bibi and thus Hakim Jan Bibi inherited 2 annas share in the land left by Omar Ali and thus the plaintiffs are co-sharers in the land of Hakim Jan Bib and the said fact is not denied or disputed by the contesting defendant and in that state of the matter plaintiffs are entitled to the extent of share to the land in suit as heirs of Hakim Jan Bibi, that Hakim Jan Bibi's heirs by inheritance is not entitled to any land since Hakim Jan Bibi during his life time exhausted her interest in respect of the land she got by inheritance from Omar Ali and thus the successive heirs of Hakim Jan Bibi is not entitled to any share in the land in suit by inheritance but the heirs of Jebal Hossain will get 14 1/3 decimals of land on the basis of Ext.7.<br/> <br/>9. The High Court Division on modifica­tion of the judgment and decree of the lower appellate Court allotted 14 1/3 deci­mals of land in the share of the heirs of Jebal Hossain from the land in suit. The High Court Division while making the Rule absolute observed that heirs of Hakim Jan Bibi shall not get any land from the land in suit by inheritance.<br/> <br/>10.  The learned Counsel submits that the patta that was submitted before the High Court Division and marked as Ext. 'Uma' mention quantity of land 1.52 acres whereas land in suit was shown 1.14 acres as evidenced by the certified copy of the patta dated February 17, 1902 submitted by the plaintiff and thus because of the discrepancy as to the quantity of the land in the document filed by the plaintiff and the  document  filed  by  the  defendant which was marked as Ext. 'Uma' the con­tention of the parties call for investigation and adjudication. Suffice it to say quanti­ty of land which was made the subject matter of the suit, as submitted by the learned Counsel for the petitioner, is referable to the averment made in the plaint on the basis of the papers relied upon by the plaintiffs. The papers i.e. the patta on the basis of which averments were made in the plaint and claim in respect of 34 decimals of land was made does not contain the name of the person through whom plaintiffs claimed the land in suit. This being the position, the con­tention of the learned Counsel that quanti­ty of land in plaintiffs' patta and in the patta submitted by the defendant being different the matter needs investigation is of no substance since patta submitted by the plaintiffs disproved their claim in the land in suit. The case of the defendant is that the patta dated February 17, 1902 is in the name of Abdul Ali alone and said contention has been established by reli­able evidence. The defendant is claiming the land as of Omar Ali and such patta submitted by the plaintiffs has nothing to do as to quantity of land the plaintiff have made the subject matter of the suit since said patta does not show the name of the person through whom plaintiffs claimed the land in suit. The point for determina­tion in the suit was whether plaintiffs as heirs of Hakim Jan Bibi can legally claim the land of patta dated February 17, 1902 which stands in the name of Abdul Ali. It has been concurrently held by the courts below and by the High Court Division that patta dated February 17, 1902 stands in the name of Abdul Ali and as such plaintiffs' claim in the land in suit upon making contention that patta dated February 17, 1902 was in the name of Hakim Jan Bibi, wife of Omar Ali and Abdul Ali son of Omar Ali being not established and in fact the patta being in the name of Abdul Ali alone, the plaintiffs had no basis of claiming the land of the patta of February 17, 2002 and thereupon claiming 34 decimals of land in their saham.<br/> <br/>In the background of the discussions made hereinabove we find no merit in the Petition.<br/> <br/>Accordingly the petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
