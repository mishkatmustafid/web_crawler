The case of the writ petitioners, in short, is that their father Md. Sirajul Hoque obtained a licence from the Bangladesh Railway (shortly the Railway) in respect of case Plot No. 32 of Mouza Sonaimuri, Noakhali in Miscellaneous Case No. 5942 of 1973 and paid licence fees to the Railway for the year 1972-73 and he paid licence fee up to the year 1980 as a lessee under the Railway. Thereafter, the Government demanded the case land as khas land the writ petitioner prayed for lease of the land from the Government and they were granted lease of .03 ¼ acre of land by the Government and subsequently the said area was increased by .04 ¼ acre. Their further case is that they were ready to pay the requisite licence/lease money in respect of the case land but the respondents did not accept any rent from the writ petitioners after 1401 B.S. Suddenly by two impugned orders issued on 21.09.2002 the writ petitioners were asked to vacate the case land and to remove the structures on the land within seven days.<br/> <br/>3. The respondent Nos.1 and 3 contested the Rule by filing affidavit-in-opposition and denied the material allegations made in the writ petition. Their case is that the writ petitioner were granted yearly lease by after getting the yearly lease they failed to pay yearly fees and without permission of the Government they grabbed .01 ¼ acre of land and for that reason the yearly licence/lease was cancelled by the Government and they also violated the terms and conditions of the licence/lease agreement by erecting structure thereon and also grabbing .01 ¼ acre of land beyond that covered by the agreement. The further case is that the petitioner was served with notice of such violation of the terms of agreement and asked to explain their position. The further case is that the case land being the 'periphery' of the Hat and bazar there was no scope to give set­tlement to anybody of more than .500 acre or ½ decimal of land. The respondents reiterate that the Government granted tem­porary licence to the writ petitioners for .03 ¼ acre of land on a yearly basis in Settlement Case No. 39/82-83, but the petitioners constructed pucca structure violating     the conditions of the licence/lease agreement, i.e. the petition­ers constructed 'two tin-shed pucca wall shops' and in the process grabbed an extra .01 Vi acre of land illegally. Inspite of notice served   the petitioners   neither responded nor removed the illegal struc­ture from the case land.<br/> <br/>4. Being aggrieved, the writ petitioners moved the High Court Division in writ jurisdiction and obtained Rule, which after hearing was discharged.<br/> <br/>5. We have heard Mr. Mahbubey Alam, the learned Counsel for the petitioners and Mr. Zainul Abedin, the learned Advocate-on-Record for the respondents and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record.<br/> <br/>6. It is not disputed that the writ petition­ers were licencess in respect of Government khas land and after 1401 B.S. they did not pay licence fee/lease money. Moreover their licence/yearly lease was cancelled for violation of terms of lease agreement.<br/> <br/>7. It is needless to mention here that licence does not create any interest.<br/> <br/>8. Therefore, in the facts and circumstance of the case and in view of the discussion made above, we are of the view that the High Court Division upon correct Assess­ment of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision.<br/> <br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
