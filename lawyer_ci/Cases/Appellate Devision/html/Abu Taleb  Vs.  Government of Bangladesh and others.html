The Government of Bangladesh formeda corporate body, namely, Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh by CivilAviation Authority Ordinance, 1985 (Ordinance No. XXXVIII of 1985). Theemployees of the Civil Aviation Department, hitherto enjoying the terms andconditions of the Government servants, refused to be governed by the newService Rules and Regulations framed under the Ordinance No. LI of 1985. Someof them went on strike with effect from February 19, 1987. </p><p style="text-align:justify">2. The Government set up anInquiry Committee on March 1, 1987. The Committee submitted a report to theGovernment. On the basis of that report the appellant was compulsorily retiredfrom service under the Public Servants Retirement Act, 1974 by an order of thePresident of Bangladesh dated January 2, 1988. </p><p style="text-align:justify">3. The appellant challenged thatorder before the Administrative Tribunal in AT Case No. 22 of 1988. TheTribunal upheld the order. The appellant filed an appeal before the AdministrativeAppellate Tribunal, being Appeal No. 34 of 1988. </p><p style="text-align:justify">4. On June 12, 1989 theAdministrative Appellate Tribunal pronounced the judgment in open court inpresence of the learned Advocates for the appellant and respondent No. 2 andallowed the appeal. It was noted in the order sheet that the judgment would bein a separate sheet. </p><p style="text-align:justify">5. On June 15, 1989 on thesubmission of the learned Advocate of respondent No. 1, the Government, thedecision dated June 12, 1989 was recalled and the appeal was fixed for re-hearingon June 19, 1989. On June 19, 1989, the Chairman of the Administrative Tribunalwas absent, the appeal was heard by two Members of the Tribunal. The Judgmentof the Tribunal allowing the appeal was, however, signed by the Chairman andthe two Members. </p><p style="text-align:justify">6. The appellant contends thatafter pronouncing the decision on June 12, 1989 the Appellate Tribunal became functusofficio and had no jurisdiction to review its judgment and that the AppellateTribunal, not being a civil Court, had no jurisdiction to recall the decisionannounced on June 19, 1989 on alleged consent of the learned Advocate for theappellant. </p><p style="text-align:justify">7. It is further contended thatwhen the appeal was allowed on re‑hearing the Appellate Tribunal was coram nonjudice because section 7 (3B) of the Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980 impliesthat the Chairman and two Members were required to be present in the beginningof the re‑hearing of the appeal. </p><p style="text-align:justify">8. The respondents have notjoined issues with the appellant's contentions that the Tribunal is not a civilCourt and that it has no power to review. They have, however, contended thatwhen the order was recalled the Appellate Tribunal was in seisin of the matterand not functus officio and appellant's contention that the Tribunal as a bodyought to have re‑heard the appeal is not correct in view of the provision ofsection 7(3B) of the Act. In this regard reliance is placed on Project inCharge Vs. Abdur Rahman, 31 DLR 124 and General Manager, Jamuna Oil Company Vs.Golam Rahman &amp; another, 34 DLR (AD) 166. </p><p style="text-align:justify">9. It is submitted that theTribunal, as an adjudicating body, has power to alter, modify or change itsjudgment before it is signed and scaled. Reliance is placed on Beni MadhoPrasad Singh Vs. Adit and others AIR 1953 Allahabad 416, Surendra Singh Vs.State of Uttar Pradesh AIR 1954 (SC) 194 at P 197, Faulad and another Vs. StateAIR 1961 Allahabad P 326, Rukan Din Vs. Hafiz‑ud‑Din PLD 1962 Lahore 161,Sangam Lal Vs. Rent Control and Eviction Officer, AIR 1966 Allahabad (FB) 221. </p><p style="text-align:justify">10. In Jai Karan Vs. PanchaitiAkhara, Choto Nayan Udasi Nanak Shahi AIR 1933 Allahabad 49 (J), after hearingthe arguments the learned Chief Justice dictated an order in the open Court.But immediately thereafter a request by one of the counsels of the parties thatthe judgment might not be signed so that the question of limitation arising inthe case might further be considered was acceded to by the Court. Thetranscript of the judgment was, however, signed by inadvertence. Sulaiman, CJset aside the order and reheard the matter. This was a case where a mistakecommitted by a functionary of the Court itself was later set right by the Courtin its inherent jurisdiction. </p><p style="text-align:justify">11. In AIR1953 Allahabad p. 416was held that "by reason of the provisions contained in r. 3 of Or. 20 ofthe CPC, jurisdiction of the Court to reconsider and rehear a case will ceaseonly when a judgment has been signed. After it has been signed, the judgmentcannot be altered or added to except as provided by section 152 Civil PC or onreview." </p><p style="text-align:justify">12. In Full Bench case theAllahabad High Court in AIR 1966 Allahabad p. 221 after considering AIR 1954(SC) p. 194 and AIR 1961 Allahabad 326 held "a judgment which has beenorally dictated in open Court can be completely changed before it is signed andsealed provided notice is given to all parties concerned and they are heardbefore the change is made." </p><p style="text-align:justify">13. Finding these decisions areof the civil Court and that the Administrative Tribunal is not a civil Courtthe respondents alternatively have urged that where an Act confers ajurisdiction it impliedly also grants the power of doing all such acts oremploy such means as are essentially necessary to its execution. Reliance isplaced on Mohd. Fazlur Rahman Vs. Custodian of Evacuee Property AIR 1956 (FB)Hyderabad, 91. </p><p style="text-align:justify">14. Our attention is also drawnto the following observation made in Craies on Statute Law, Seventh Edition,Page‑111. </p><p style="text-align:justify">   “If a statute is passed for the purpose ofenabling something to be done, but omits to mention in terms some detail whichis of great importance (if not actually essential) to the proper and effectualperformance of the work which the statute has in contemplation, the courts areat liberty to infer that the statute by implication empowers that detail to becarried out." </p><p style="text-align:justify">15. The respondents furthercontend that there is no provision in rules for announcing the judgment and theearlier order was not passed under its sub‑rule 9 of Rule 6 of theAdministrative Tribunal Rules, 1982 which reads as follows: </p><p style="text-align:justify">   "(9) The Tribunal shall, after theapplication has been heard, give its decision in writing with reasonstherefore, at once or on some future day of which notice shall be given to theparties, and make an order accordingly." </p><p style="text-align:justify">16. Appellant in reply contendsthat in any case the Appellate Tribunal passed an order on June 12,1989 whichcannot be recalled or modified in view of the following sub‑rule 10 of rule 6of the Administrative Tribunals Rules, 1982: </p><p style="text-align:justify">   "(10) The decision or order oncegiven or made shall not afterwards be altered or modified, save for the purposeof correcting a clerical or arithmetical mistake or any error arising from anyaccidental slip or omission." </p><p style="text-align:justify">As the decision pronounced onJune 12, 1989 was not made as per sub-rule (9) of rule 6 of the Rules it didnot reach any finality. The Appellate Tribunal did not become functus officioon that date and it had the jurisdiction as an adjudicating body to recall thatdecision subsequently and order for rehearing. </p><p style="text-align:justify">17. In James A Ballentine's LawDictionary the entry on rehearing reads as follows: </p>             “Strictly speaking, a rehearing is simplya new hearing and a new consideration of the case by the Court in which thesuit was originally held, and upon the pleadings and depositions already in thecase. See Read 6 Am. St. Rep. 877, 10 At 1. Rep. 385." <p style="text-align:justify">18. In Stroud's JudicialDictionary (1974) it is stated a "rehearing" is a new trial, and isnot satisfied by merely reading the transcript of the first trial (R V Syme, Exp. Page [197] WAR 1953). </p><p style="text-align:justify">19. The word ‘rehearing’ meanshearing again. A rehearing is a new proceeding and it implies the hearing bythe same tribunal which heard the matter before. Apart from the constructionthat I have given to the word 'rehearing' I like to point out that it is anaccepted principle of procedure that prior notice for rehearing is to be givento the parties who were present at the time of the hearing of the matterearlier. This principle is in consonance with justice and is to be extended tothe constitution of the adjudicating body when it comprises of more than oneperson. When the matter was heard earlier by all the members of the Tribunalrehearing ought to have been done by all of them, more so, when the decisionannounced earlier was reversed on rehearing. The same body of the Tribunalcomprising the Chairman and two Members ought to have heard the matter. Thedecision cited in 31 DLR 124 and 34 DLR (AD) 166 can hardly be applied in theinstant case. </p><p style="text-align:justify">In view of the above, the appealis allowed and the matter is sent back to the Appellate Administrative Tribunalfor rehearing by its Chairman and two Members. No costs. </p><p style="text-align:justify">Ed. </p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span> </div></div>
