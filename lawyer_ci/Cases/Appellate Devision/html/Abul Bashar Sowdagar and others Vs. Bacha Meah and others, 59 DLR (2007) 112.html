The plaintiffs instituted Other Class Suit No. 2 of 1982, in the Court of Assistant Judge, Fatikchari, Chittagong for permanent injunction restraining defendant Nos. 1-11 from passing any scheme or from giving effect to the same for blocking the stream of Balukhali khal or its feeding canals at Chandpur Mouza and from diverting course of the khal in any way to foil the plaintiffs' scheme at Shailkopa on RS plot Nos. 4109 and 96 corresponding to RS plot No.49.<br/> <br/>3. The case of the plaintiffs, in a nutshell, is that they are the inhabitants of Sailakupa Mouza and have cultivable lands at Sailakupa. There are about 336.52 acres of cultivable lands in Sailakupa which is a low-lying area. At the request of the people of this area, the Government allowed construction of a dam across the Balukali khal at Sailakupa by taking up a scheme. As a result, the people of Chandpur Mouza out of enmity in collusion with defendant Nos. 1-11 have been trying to construct a dam at Chandpur Mouza, which is in the upstream of Balukhali khal. If the defendants construct such a dam in the upstream of Balukali khal or take such a scheme for construction of dam in the-upstream, the people of Sailokupa Mouza will suffer irreparable injury during rainy season. Therefore, the plaintiffs were constrained to file the suit.<br/> <br/>4. Defendant Nos. 15-36 contested the suit by filing a written statement denying all the material allegations made in the plaint. Their case, in short, is that Balukhali Khal is far off from Sailokupa. Since 1959 the people of Chanpur Mouza with the prior concurrence of the Government have been constructing a dam at Chanpur Mouza across Balukhali khal for the development of irrigation. This dam will not affect the land of Sailokupa. Out of previous grudge and enmity, the plaintiffs have filed this suit.<br/> <br/>5. Both the parties examined witnesses and adduced documentary evidence in support of their respective cases.<br/> <br/>6. The trial Court decreed the suit. The contesting defendants appealed against the decree. The lower appellate Court allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit reversing the judgment and decree passed by the trial Court.<br/> <br/>7. Feeling aggrieved by impugned judgment and decree passed by the lower appellate Court, the plaintiffs as the petitioners obtained this Rule from this Court.<br/> <br/>8. Mr. AKM Abdul Hakim, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of Mr. Kamal-ul-Alam, learned Advocate for the petitioners, submits that the lower appellate Court allowed the appeal and reversed the judgment and decree passed by the trial Court on the ground of maintainability of the suit although the trial Court, assigning reasons, found that the suit as framed was maintainable. He further submits that the lower appellate Court erroneously found that the suit was barred under section 91 of the Local Government Ordinance, 1976, although the contesting defendants did not raise such objection at the initial stage of the suit and, as such, the trial Court found that at the hearing of the suit no such objection was permissible. He lastly submits that the judgment of lower appellate Court is not a proper judgment as contemplated under Order XLI, rule 31 of the Code.<br/> <br/>9. Mr. Khurshed Alam Khan, the learned Advocate appearing for opposite party Nos. 3, 12, 14, 16 and 18, submits that the suit as framed was barred under section 91 of Local Government Ordinance, 1976 as no prior notice was issued before its institution. He lastly submits that the provisions made in section 91 of Local Government Ordinance, 1976 are mandatory in nature. In support of his contention, he relies on 2 cases, which we shall consider later.<br/> <br/>10. I have perused the revisional application and the judgments of the Courts below. The trial Court not only found that the suit was maintainable as framed but it also found that the plaintiffs were successful in making out a case for a decree of permanent injunction against the defendants. The lower appellate Court, on the other hand, found that the suit as framed was not maintainable as the provisions of section 91 of the Local Government Ordinance, 1976 were not complied with prior to the institution of the suit.<br/><strong>The fate of this Rule hinges on maintainability of the suit. In order to address this point, let us have a glimpse over section 91 of the Local Government Ordinance, 1976. Section 91 runs as follows:</strong><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"<strong>91. Institution of suits against local Parishads, etc.-</strong> No suit shall be instituted against a local Parishad or against any member, officer or employee of a local Parishad in respect of any act done or purporting to be done in official capacity, until the expiration of one month next after notice in writing has been, in the case of a local Parishad, delivered or left at its office, and in the case of a member, officer or employee delivered to him or left at his office or place of abode, stating the cause of action and the name and place of abode of the intending plaintiff, and the plaint shall contain a statement that such notice has been so delivered or left."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>11. Similar provisions were also enacted in section 152 of Paurashava Ordinance, 1997. For the purpose of comparing section 91 of the Local Government Ordinance, with section 152 of the Paurashava Ordinance, 1977 let us have a glimpse over section 152 which runs as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"No suit shall be instituted against a Paurashava, or against any commissioner, officer or employee of a Paurashava in respect of airy act done or purporting to be done in official capacity, until the expiration of one month next after notice in writing has been, in the case of a Paurashava, delivered or left at its office, and in the case of commissioner, officer or employee, delivered to him or left at his office or place of abode, stating the cause of action and the name and place of abode of the intending plaintiff, and the plaint shall contain a statement that such notice has been so delivered or left."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>12. Section 91 of the Local Government Ordinance, 1976 and section 152 of the Paurashava Ordinance, 1977 were couched in identical language. In the case of <em><strong>Narayanganj Paurashava, represented by its Administrator, Narayanganj; Chairman, Narayanganj Paurashava and others vs. Abdur Razzak 46 DLR 295</strong></em>, it has been held that notice under section 152 of the Paurashava Ordinance, 1977 is sine qua non in all circumstances for instituting a suit against the Paurashava for anything done in official capacity. In the above case, the suit was filed against the Paurashava without complying with provisions of section 152 of the Paurashava Ordinance, 1977 and the suit was decreed. The appellate Court affirmed the decree passed in the suit In such state of affairs, the High Court Division <em>set aside</em> the judgment of both the Courts below for non-compliance with the provisions of section 152 of the Paurashava Ordinance, 1977. Similar view was taken in the case of <em><strong>Zakia Sultana vs. Maksuda Parvin and others 8 BLC 168</strong></em>. Therefore, the contention that objection as to maintainability of the suit has to be taken at the earliest opportunity does not stand to reason. Where there are mandatory provisions of law to be complied with before filing a suit, such provisions must be complied with before institution of the suit In the case in hand, since the provisions of section 91, Local Government Ordinance,1976 were not complied with, the suit was not maintainable. As such, the appellate Court correctly found that the case as framed was not maintainable.<br/> <br/>13. The plaintiffs as the petitioners obtained Rule from this Court impugning judgment and decree passed by the lower appellate Court but on the date of issuance of the Rule, no interim order in the form of injunction was passed against the defendants. Therefore, there was no injunction for the last 18 years. After lapse of 18 years from the date of dismissal of the suit, the plaintiffs now cannot get a decree for permanent injunction.<br/> <br/>14. The findings arrived at and the decisions made by the lower appellate Court do not suffer from any patent illegality or flagrant violation of law warranting interference by this Court exercising power under section 115(1) of the Code.<br/> <br/>In the light of the findings made before, I do not find any substance in this Rule.<br/> <br/>In the result, the Rule is discharged without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/>Sent down the LC record with a copy of the judgment.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
