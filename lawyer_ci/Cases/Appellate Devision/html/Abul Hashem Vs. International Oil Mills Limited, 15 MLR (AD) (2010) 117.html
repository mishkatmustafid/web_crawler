Abdul Matin J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This petition for leave to appeal and the Civil Miscellaneous Petitions are directed against the judgment and order dated 28.02.2008 passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No.4310 of 2001 making the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>2. The facts, in short, are that the writ petitioner International Oil Mills Limited, a company incorporated in the year 1963 is engaged in Tank Terminal business upon obtaining a permission from the Chittagong Port Authority, respondent No.4 on lease hold basis situated beside the Karnaphuii River where it established its tank terminal business. The area of lease hold land is 1.53 acres which the petitioner is holding on yearly renewable lease since its establishment of the said business of tank terminal in the year 1964.<br/> <br/>3. In the writ petition the respondent No.1 M/S Amin Agency (1947) Limited, is a nationalized enterprise controlled by the respondent No.2 whose premises is situated beside the south eastern side of the writ petitioner's premises on the land owned by the respondent No.4, Chittagong Port Authority hereinafter mentioned as CPA, having an area of 3.20 acres of land which the respondent No.1 also hold on yearly renewable lease under the respondent No.4. In the year 1989 the writ petitioner felt urgent need of more land for expanding its tank terminal. Finding that the respondent No.1 has some unutilized excess land in the back yard of its premises as ditch and low lying area, the petitioner approached the authority of the then respondent No.1 for leasing its unutilized ditch and low lying areas situated at the back yard measuring 0.75 acre in favour of the writ petitioner company and thereby allow the writ petitioner to take lease of the said 0.75 acre of land from the respondent No.4, CPA which the management of respondent No.1 agreed, subject to taking permission from its controlling authority writ respondent No.2. But the writ respondent No.2 Bangladesh Sugar and Food Industries Corporation being the controlling authority of respondent No.1 M/S Amin Agencies (1947), was required to take appropriate permission from the writ respondent No.3, i.e. Ministry of Industries for abandoning lease hold excess unutilized land of M/S Amin Agencies (1947) Limited to the third party and accordingly the writ respondent No.3 by its letter dated 30 .05.1989(Annexure-A) gave permission to the  writ respondent No.2 for abandoning lease hold excess unutilized land and transferring 0.75 acre of such land to the writ petitioner company for facilitating their expansion program. After receiving such permission the writ respondent No.2 by letter dated 10.06.1989 (Annexure-I(ii)) directed the management of the writ respondent No.1 to take necessary steps to return back the lease hold land of 0.75 acre to the writ respondent No.4 the Chittagong Port Authority to facilitate them to lease out the same to the writ petitioner company. Thereafter the management of the writ respondent No.1 by its letter dated 08.10.1991 took appropriate steps and upon advise of the writ respondent No.4 informed the writ petitioner  company  by  letter dated 13.10.1991 (Annexure-C) to obtain lease of the said 0.75 acre of land from the writ respondent No.4 CPA. By that letter the writ petitioner company was asked to submit a joint application with the writ respondent No.1 to the writ respondent No.4, Chittagong Port Authority, prior to which, the writ respondent No.1 was required to pay off the dues relating to lease money of Tk.7, 28,857.31 for the period of 01.01.1984 to 31.12.1990 to the lessor i.e. writ respondent No.4 Chittagong Port Authority. Subsequently by letter dated 06.04.1994 (Annexure-K) the management of the writ respondent No.1 M/S Amin Agencies requested the writ respondent No.4 to allow them to handover the said land of 0.75 acre to the writ petitioner company. Later on a further prayer of the writ petitioner to get more 0.25 acre of land adjacent to the said 0.75 acre, the writ respondent No.2 through its letter dated 30.04.1994 (Annexure-L) informed the writ respondent No.1 about their decision of allowing this more 0.25 acre of land to the writ petitioner and also to make a term with the writ petitioner to pay off the dues relating to lease money of the writ respondent No.1 and upon which the management of the writ respondent No.1 again, through its letter dated 04.07.1994 (Annexure-N), requested the writ respondent No.4 to allow lease of more 0.25 acre of land in favour of the writ petitioner company along with the earlier 0.75 acre of land. Subsequently pursuant to an eviction case filed earlier by the writ respondent No.4 against the-writ respondent No.1, due to non payment of due lease money, the writ petitioner company upon taking permission from the Court of Special Magistrate in a Petition Case No.19 of 1990 sent a pay order of  Tk.7,68,922.47 forwarded through its letter dated 10.08.1994 (Annexure-D) to the writ respondent No.1to facilitate the payment of due lease money for the period up to 31.12.1994 of the writ respondent No.1. Upon receiving the said pay order the writ respondent No.1 paid off the dues of the writ respondent No.4 through treasury challan dated 14.09.1994 (Annexure-D (ii)). Thereafter the writ petitioner company upon getting the possession of the entire 1.00 acre of land situated at the back yard of the premises of the writ respondent No.1 filled up the ditch and the low lying land by earth upon expending Tk.3,00,000/- from its own fund which was informed to the writ respondent No.4 through letter dated 05.11.1995 (Annexure-Q). The writ petitioner company through the said letter dated 05.11.1995 also formally prayed for lease of 0.75 acre of land either in favour of its sister concern or in its own favour. The writ respondent No.4 CPA by letter dated 19.06.2001 (Annexure-W) to the writ respondent No. 5, its controlling Ministry informed the decision of leasing out 0.75 acre of land to the writ petitioner company subject to permission accorded by the writ respondent No.5. Accordingly, the writ respondent No.5 accorded such permission to the writ respondent No.4, CPA through letter dated 05.07.2001 (Annexure-X) with a copy to the writ petitioner to lease out the aforesaid land of 0.75 acre to the writ petitioner.<br/> <br/>4. In the meantime, during the pendency of such leasing out process, the Government decided to denationalize the writ respondent No.1 company, M/S Amin Agency and  accordingly the writ respondent No.1 company was given under the control and authority of the Privatization Commission (writ respondent No.6) who published tender notice dated 22.01.2001 in the news paper (Annexure-E) on 30.01.2001 for sale of the respondent No.1 company showing in the said tender notice the lease hold land belonged to the writ respondent No.1 as 3.20 acres without excluding the said 0.75 acre of land. Thereafter the writ respondent Nos. 2 to 6 in their meeting held on 10.07.2001 took resolution (Annexure-G) and decided to refrain from leasing out 0.75 acre of land in favour of the writ petitioner company.<br/> <br/>5.  Under such circumstances, the writ petitioner  obtained  the  Rule seeking direction upon the respondents to lease out and handover the said 0.75 acre of land and also challenged the legality and propriety of the aforesaid decision dated 10.07.2001 (Annexure-G) and  also the legality and validity of the tender notice dated 22.01.2001.<br/> <br/>6. The Rule being duly served upon the writ respondents, the respondent Nos.1, 2, 4 and 6 entered appearance to oppose the same. In the meantime, the writ respondent No.7 the highest bidder in the auction, pursuant to tender notice dated 22.01.2001, added himself as writ respondent No.7, who also contested the Rule by filing a separate affidavit-in-opposition.<br/> <br/>7. The writ respondent Nos.1 and 2 filed affidavit-in-opposition on 03.05.2006 and a supplementary affidavit-in-opposition on 31.08.2007. The writ respondent No.4 filed affidavit-in-opposition on 15.08.2007 and writ respondent No.6 filed affidavit-in-opposition on 15.05.2007 and a supplementary affidavit-in-opposition on 16.09.2007. The writ respondent No.7 filed affidavit-in-opposition and supplementary affidavits on 02.04.2006 and 16.08.2007.<br/> <br/>8. The writ respondent Nos.1 and 2 in their affidavit-in-opposition and supplementary affidavit-in-opposition denied the material allegations of the writ petition stating, inter-alia, that the writ respondent No.1 M/S Amin Agency (1947) Limited before its nationalization obtained an annual lease of land measuring 3.20 acres from the respondent No.4 CPA in the year 1959 and since then the said respondent is using the said land for fish processing plant. The respondent No.3 recommended for transfer of 0.75 acre of land in favour of the writ petitioner and lease of which was required to be taken from the Port Authority (respondent No.4) on lease by the petitioner. The writ respondent No.4 filed Petition Case No.18 of 1998 in the Court of Magistrate, 1st Class cum authorized officer of the Chittagong Port Authority praying for eviction of the respondent No.1 from the lease hold land due to non-payment of lease money. The said case was allowed by judgment dated 12.04.2001 against which the respondent No.1 filed Criminal Appeal No.12 of 2001 before the Court of Additional District Magistrate, Chittagong but the same was later withdrawn on 05.09.2001 as per direction of the Government. It is further stated that the respondent No.4, CPA has the sole authority to create any lease of their land and none of the respondents have any right to create lease of the said property owned by the respondent No.4 in favour of the writ petitioner neither 1.00 acre of land nor 0.75 acre of land was leased out to the petitioner at any point of time and as such the writ petitioner has no right, title or interest in the said land. The respondent No.6 published tender notice in the news paper for sale of the fish processing plant of the respondent No.1 wherein the lease hold land of the respondent No.1 has correctly been shown as 3.20 acres of land.<br/> <br/>9. The respondent No.4 of the writ petition CPA, through its affidavit-in-opposition denied the material allegations made in the writ petition contending, inter alia, that the respondent No.1, M/S Amin Agency Limited, held the land in question under annual lease from the owner of the property i.e. the Chittagong Port Authority, (respondent No.4) and as such the respondent Nos.1 and 2 are not the proper authority of leasing out the said land to the petitioner. The respondent No.3, the Ministry of Industries, is not the controlling authority of the respondent No.4 and as such the respondent Nos.1, 2 and 3 have no authority to recommend or to lease out the land in question to the petitioner without the approval of the respondent No.4. The respondent No.4 never gave approval nor made any promise for leasing out the said land to the petitioner nor the respondent No.4 complied with the request dated 23.08.1989 (annexure-B) made by the respondent Nos.1,2 and 3. The petitioner company requested the respondent No.4 to handover the possession of 0.75 acre of land on lease to the petitioner which indicates that the writ petitioner knew the fact that the respondent No.4 duly informed the petitioner through Annexure-C that the respondent Nos.1, 2 and 3 are not the proper authority to lease out the land in question to the petitioner. The respondent No.4 received pay order amounting of Tk. 7,68,922.00 as mentioned in paragraph Nos.10 and 22 of the writ petition as payment of due lease money  of M/S Amin Agency (1947) Limited, (the  respondent  No.1).  The respondent No.4 did not receive any money as rent from the petitioner for the land in question and did not allot the same to the writ petitioner. The respondent No.4 did not execute any lease deed nor made any promise to lease out the said land to the petitioner. The tender process for the sale of the property of respondent No.1 being reached its finality the rule as such became infractuous and is liable to be discharged.<br/> <br/>10. The writ respondent No.6  the Privatization Commission, by filing affidavit-in-opposition denied the material allegations of the writ petition contending, inter-alia, that the respondent No.1 held 3.20 acres of land upon obtaining renewable lease from the respondent No.4 CPA, where the respondent No.1 established a fish processing plant in 1959 and after the expiry of the lease period on 31.12.1994 the  respondent No.4 was not willing to renew the lease of the respondent No.1 and the respondent No.4 accepted the lease money till 31.12.1994. A case for eviction was filed after the expiry of the aforesaid lease period against the respondent No.1. On a meeting held on 28.10.1996, participated by respondent Nos. 6,5,3 and 2 it was decided that in order to set up the industries or expansion of the same on the land of respondent No.4 an agreement for lease has to be executed with the respondent No.4 Chittagong Port Authority. The respondent No.6 floated tender for privatization of the respondent No.1 which was opened on 12.03.2001 and upon considering all the bids of the contending parties it was held in the meeting dated 14.03.2001 that the bid offered by respondent No.7 be accepted for quoting the highest bid of Tk.16,66, 66,666.00. It is disputed that 0.75 acre of land was allotted to the writ petitioner, as revealed from Annexure-D and in a meeting held on 07.05.2001 it was decided that a proposal should be sent to the respondent No.3 to sell the respondent No.1 Company to the respondent No.7. On a further inter ministerial meeting held on 10.07.2001 it was decided that the respondent No.4, Chittagong Port Authority, will give fresh lease of 3.20 acres of land to the respondent No.1 and no lease of 0.75 acre of land will be allowed to the writ petitioner. The proposal for sale of respondent No.1 Company having been accepted by the Government and the agreement for transfer as such having been executed on 25.05.2006 this writ petition is not maintainable and as such the Rule is liable to be discharged.<br/> <br/>11. The respondent No.7 by filing a separate affidavit-in-opposition contended that the writ petition is not maintainable since the writ petitioner has no locus standi and legal right to file this writ petition. The writ petition is categorically stated that by quoting a bid of Tk. 16, 66,660.00/- he became the highest bidder wherein the petitioner did not participate nor raised any objection whatsoever. Accordingly inter ministerial meeting held on 10.07.2007 as evident from Annexure-G to the writ petition, reveals that the Chittagong Port Authority, the respondent No.4, will refrain from leasing out 0.75 acre of land to the petitioner and the new owner of M/S Amin Agency will execute an agreement with the respondent No.4 and thus 0.75 acre of land was never leased out to the writ petitioner and the writ petitioner has no right to claim any part of the same. It is further stated that the properties of M/S Amin Agencies has been physically handed over to the respondent No.7 by respondent No.3 on 05.10.2006 as evident from Annexure-2 to the affidavit-in-opposition filed by the respondent No.7. The respondent No. 4, CPA, informed the respondent No.7 as well as the respondent No.6 that the respondent No.4 owed an outstanding bill of Tk.44,18,763.08 from the respondent No.1 and if that amount is paid then they are willing to execute the lease agreement in favour of the respondent No.7 which the respondent No.7, though not liable to repay, paid the entire amount by two cheques dated 26.12.2006 in favour of the respondent No.4 requesting the respondent No.4 to complete the lease agreement in favour of the respondent No.7. Finally on 14.01.2007 the respondent No, 4 executed lease agreement with the respondent No.7 and leased out the said land of 3.20 acres of land for a period from 01.01.2007 to 31.12.2011. As such nothing is left for consideration in the Rule. Under such circumstances the respondent No.7 claimed that the rule should be discharged.<br/> <br/>12. The writ petitioner by filing supplementary affidavit contended that the respondent No.4 by its letter dated 19.06.2001 (Annexure-W to the supplementary affidavit) addressed to the Ministry of Shipping, respondent No.5, categorically stated that:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“মূলত ১৯৯৮ সাল থেকে ইন্টারন্যাশানাল অয়েল মিলস লিঃ ০.৭৫ একর জমি হস্তান্তরের আবেদন জানিয়ে আসছেন। শিল্প মন্ত্রণালয় উক্ত জমি হস্তান্তরের জন্য পূণঃ পূণঃ সম্মতি/অনুরোধ জ্ঞাপন করেছে। ইতিপূর্বে চবক বোর্ড ০.৭৫ একর জমি মেসার্স ইন্টারন্যাশানাল অয়েল মিলস লিঃ বরাবরে বরাদ্দ প্রদানে সম্মতি জ্ঞাপন করেছে। নৌপম সম্মত থাকলে এডিএম কোর্টে বিচারাধীন মামলা নিষ্পত্তি সাপেক্ষে ০.৭৫ একর জমি ইন্টারন্যাশানাল অয়েল মিলস লিঃ বরাবরে বরাদ্দ/ইজারাভূক্ত করনের বিষয়টি বিবেচনা করা যেতে পারে”।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>13. Pursuant to the said letter of the respondent No.4, the Ministry of Shipping by its letter dated 05.07.2001 (Annexure-X) directed the respondent No.4 to lease out 0.75 acre of land in favor of the petitioner and the copy of the same was accordingly served upon the petitioner by the said Ministry also. By annexing the order sheet of Criminal Appeal No.12 of 2001 (annexure-Y-1) the petitioner stated that the appeal arising out the eviction case filed by the respondent No.4 has been disposed of on the prayer of the petitioner and as such the eviction order passed by the Magistrate for nonpayment of lease money by the respondent No.1 does not stand anymore. By filing this order sheet (Annexure-Y-1) the petitioner further contended that this has been done pursuant to letter dated 05.07.2001 issued by the respondent No.5. By annexing Annexure-Z, the letter dated 17.01.2006, the petitioner contended that the Director of the Board of Investment asked the respondent No.4 to lease out of the 0.75 acre of land in favour of the petitioner and thereby expressed its no objection. A copy of the said letter has been communicated to the writ petitioner and the same has been annexed by the petitioner.<br/> <br/>14. In reply to the supplementary affidavit of the writ petitioner, the respondent No.7 filed a supplementary affidavit-in-opposition contending, inter alia, that the annexure-W was a communication between the respondent No.4 and its controlling authority respondent No.5 as such by inter ministerial / departmental communication no right has accrued in favour of the petitioner. In respect of annexure-Y-1 the respondent No.7 contended that before the case was withdrawn the decision as to non leasing out of the said 0.75 acre of land in favour of the petitioner has taken place and as such the petitioner could not avail the opportunity of annexure-X though the same was communicated to him and as such the petitioner has no legal right to claim that there was a promise and the petitioner has a legal right to claim the land on the basis of the said promise.<br/> <br/>15. After hearing the parties and considering the materials on record the High Court Division made  the Rule absolute and hence these petitions for leave to appeal.<br/> <br/>16. Heard Mr. Rokonuddin Mahmood, the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner in Civil Petition for leave to Appeal No.2324 of 2008 and Mr. Mahbubey Alam, learned Attorney General appearing for the petitioners in CMP No.231 of 2008 and Mr. Mahmudul Islam, appearing for the respondent No.1 in both cases and others and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and "order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/> <br/>17. Mr. Rokonuddin Mahmood, the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that admittedly writ respondent No.4 Chittagong Port Authority is the owner of the case land which did not make any promise to grant-lease of the case land to the writ petitioner and  the writ respondent No.1 Amin Agencies (1947) Ltd., writ respondent No. 2 Bangladesh Sugar and Food Industries Corporation  and writ respondent No.3 the Ministry of Industries not being the owner of the case and were not competent to make any representation to grant lease of the case land to the writ petitioner and in the absence of any unequivocal promise made by the Chittagong Port Authority and change of position by the writ petitioner relying on such promise or any established practice to claim legitimate expectation, the writ petitioner is not entitled to invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel or legitimate expectation.<br/> <br/>18. In support of his contention the learned Counsel referred the case of Chairman, Bangladesh Textile Corporation Vs. Nasir Ahmed Chy and others reported in 7 BLC (AD) 144.<br/> <br/>19. Mr. Mahmudul Islam, the learned Counsel appearing for the respondent No.1 submits that from the annexures annexed by the writ respondent Nos.1,2 and 3 in  the  writ petition the writ respondents in unequivocal manner declaring intention to return 0.75 acre of land to the writ respondent No.4, CPA to facilitate the writ petitioner to take the same lease from the writ respondent No.4, CPA and the said intention of the respondent No.1 was further expressed in accepting the pay order of Tk. 7,68,922.47 from the writ petitioner in order to relinquish their liability to pay the due lease money and by paying the lease money up to 1994 the respondent No.1 escaped the eviction order passed against it in a criminal proceeding.<br/> <br/>20. He further submits that the promise made by the respondent No.1 towards the writ petitioner cannot be revoked by the respondent No.7 since the writ petitioner upon such promise acted upon it and spent money in filling earth in the said land.<br/> <br/>21. He further submits that a case of legitimate expectation and promissory estoppel has   been made out and believed by the High Court Division and the judgment should not be interfered with.<br/> <br/>22. It appears that the High Court Division after considering the submissions and the annexures on record came to the following finding:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"From the annexures annexed by the respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 3 in the writ petition the respondents in unequivocal manner declared their intention to return the impugned 0.75 acre of land to the lessor, the respondent No.4, CPA to facilitate the petitioner to take the same on lease from the respondent No.4, CPA. The said intention of the respondent No.1 further expressed in accepting the pay order of Tk.7,68,922.47 from the writ petitioner in order to relinquish their liability to pay the due lease money and by paying the lease money up to 1994 the respondent No.1 escaped the eviction order passed against it in a criminal proceeding. The respondent No.1 being a juristic person has its independent identity and liable for its own act, deeds, things and declaration. Therefore, the promise made by respondent No.1 towards the writ petitioner cannot be revoked by the respondent No.7 the alleged present owner of the respondent No.1, since the writ petitioner upon such promise acted upon it and spent money in filling earth in the said land. On the other hand the respondent No.4, CPA in annexure-W dated 19.06.2001 in an unequivocal terms agreed on principle to lease out the said land to the petitioner and respondent No.5 the controlling authority of respondent No. 4, CPA by its letter dated 05.07.2001 directed respondent No.4, CPA to lease out the said 0.75 acre of land to the writ petitioner and a copy of the said letter has been communicated to the petitioner. So it appears that promise has already been made and as such the respondents cannot go back from the same rather the respondents are bound to fulfill the liability of the promise under the doctrine of promissory estoppels. Thus, the promise made by the respondent No.4, CPA and 5 through Annexures-W, X and Z the respondents cannot now go back from the said promise. Therefore, we hold that upon estoppel by promise the respondent Nos.1 to 5 shall be liable to fulfill its obligation toward the writ petitioner and as such the new owner of the respondent No.1 i.e. the respondent No. 7 shall be bound by such promissory estoppel of the respondent No.1."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>23. It is true that the land belongs to the Chittagong Port Authority and the promise of other respondents are all tentative and therefore cannot give rise to legitimate expectation but fact remains that the writ petitioner was persuaded to pay Tk.7, 68,922.47 and the writ petitioner paid the same and the same was accepted by Chittagong Port Authority and as a result Amin Agencies Limited got rid of the eviction order. Fact also remains that the writ petitioner filled up the ditch and the low lying area by filling earth within the full knowledge of the Chittagong Port Authority and Amin Agencies Limited, The present leave petitioner has stepped into the shoes of Amin Agencies Limited and therefore the respondents now cannot deny the writ petitioner his prayer for granting lease in respect of 0.75 acre of land. Therefore it is not necessary to enter into the legal polemic of legitimate expectation or promissory estoppel but equity demands that where a promise is made by a person knowing that it would be acted upon by the person to whom it is made and, in fact it is so acted upon it is inequitable to allow the party making the promise to go back upon it.<br/> <br/>24. In such view of the matter the leave petitioner and other respondents are bound by the doctrine of the equity not to deny the leave petitioners prayer to get lease of 0.75 acre of land and the High Court Division rightly held that the writ petitioner is entitled to get lease of 0.75 acre of land in question on lease from the respondent No.4 and also to the declaration as prayed on the land in question.<br/> <br/>25. Since it is difficult to find a specific legal right in favour of the writ petitioner there is no scope of issuing a mandamus in favour of the writ petitioner. Accordingly the civil petition for leave to appeal is dismissed with modification of the impugned judgment of the High Court Division to the effect that the writ petitioners are entitled to get lease of 0.75 acre of land as prayed for on the terms and conditions to be decided by the Port Authorities on premium to be paid and on other related matters. Civil Miscellaneous Petition is also disposed of in terms of this judgment.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
