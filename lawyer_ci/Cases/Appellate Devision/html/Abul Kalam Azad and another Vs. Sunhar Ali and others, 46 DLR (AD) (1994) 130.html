To narrate the cases of the parties, in brief, as will be relevant for disposal of these appeals, plaintiffs filed the suit for eviction of the defendants from the suit premises on the ground of default and sub-letting in violation of the agreement of tenancy. The defendants were monthly tenants by sufferance at a rental of Taka 200.00 per month under the original lessor Abdus Sobhan, the predecessor-in­-interest of the plaintiffs. Abdus Sobhan died during the subsistence of the monthly tenancy with Hazi Karam Ali, the original monthly tenant and predecessor-in-interest of the defendants. Plaintiffs served a notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act to vacate the premises and thereafter the suit was filed for ejectment of the defendants.<br/> <br/>3. Defendant Nos. 1-3 and 7 contested the suit by filing a joint written statement contending, <em>inter alia, </em>that defendant No. 1 as tenant started business in the suit premises and paid rent to the original owner Abdus Sobhan and after his death to his successor plaintiff and defendant Nos. 9‑12; that defendant No. 1 started firm in the suit premises under the name and style of "Haji Karam Ali Guest House" with his brothers defendant Nos. 2 and 3; that defendant No. 1 paid rent in his own name and subsequently in the name of the firm; that defendant Nos. 1-3 purchased the share of Muslema Khatun, wife of late Abdul Sobhan and Rahimunnessa daughter of late Abdus Sobhan by registered kabala dated 30.7.80; that defendants being co‑sharer in the suit premises cannot be evicted: that plaintiffs demanded enhanced rent from the defendants and the defendants refused to pay the same and thereafter deposited rent in the Rent Controller Case No. 18 of 1980 in the name of plaintiffs and others.<br/> <br/>4. After filing of the written statement the trial of the suit started on 6.12.86 and on that date plain6ff No.2 was examined as PW I and he was cross‑examined by defendants and PW 2 Bhupendra Mohan Chandra was examined on that date and the plaintiffs closed their case. Thereafter the case was adjourned for six times and ultimately it was fixed on 9.12.86 for further hearing and summons were issued upon defendants' witnesses for appearance. On that date the defendants filed an application for amendment of their written statement stating that defendant No. 1 who resides in UK had been there when the written statement was filed and as such some material facts were not stated in the written statement and therefore prayed for adding the additional fact that defendant No. 1 took settlement of the suit premises on permanent basis on payment of salami of Taka 65,000.00 from late Abdus Sobhan on condition to reconstruct the premises which was burnt and damaged completely during the war of liberation in 1971 at their own cost on the mediation of Haji Syed Nasiruddin of Mira Bazar, Haji Abdus Khaleque of Shibgonj and Abdul Matin of Kazi Tala and the defendant reconstructed the damaged building premises at the cost of Taka 1,75,000.00.<br/> <br/>5. Plaintiffs opposed the prayer for amendment of the written statement on the grounds firstly, that after close of plaintiffs case the defendants cannot amend the written statement raising new story from one of monthly tenancy to a case of permanent tenancy under the plaintiff. Secondly, the application for amendment is belated and an afterthought and the same having not been made <em>bonafide</em> should not be allowed.<br/> <br/>6. The trial Judge on hearing the parties rejected the prayer for amendment of the written statement of the defendants. On 9.12.86 the defendants filed another petition praying for recalling PW 1 Abul Kalam for further examination and the same was also rejected by the trial Court. Both these orders refusing amendment of the written statement and recalling PW 1 were challenged before the High Court Division in the Revision case. Both the Revisions were heard together and were allowed by a common judgment.<br/> <br/>7. Leave was granted to consider whether the prayer for amendment of the written statement could be allowed after closure of the plaintiffs case in a suit for ejectment of monthly tenant at sufferance by introducing an inconsistent and new story of payment of salami, etc. which is a totally new case of permanent tenancy in place of monthly tenancy, and further whether the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division correctly appreciated the decisions reported in <strong><em>9 DLR 217</em></strong> and <strong><em>26 DLR 205</em></strong>.<br/> <br/>8. It appears from the judgment of the High Court Division that the learned Single Judge considered Order 6 rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure and allowed the amendment of the pleadings as he thought that such amendment was necessary for the purpose of determining the real question of controversy between the parties.<br/> <br/>9. It may be pointed out here that the real question in controversy in the suit was eviction of a monthly tenant on the ground of default and sub‑letting, whereas the issues raised in the amendment of the written statement were payment of salami of Taka 65.000.00 in respect of the premises on a permanent basis and also the story of incurring an expense of Taka 1,75,000.00 for the purpose of reconstruction of the damaged building. In this case the original written statement was filed much earlier and after a long lapse of time the application for amendment of the written statement was filed. It is to be borne in mind that the amendment of a plaint and the amendment of the written statement are not governed by exactly the same principle. In the case reported in <strong><em>26 DLR 205</em></strong> the governing consideration was that an application to amend the written statement can be allowed if it is necessary to determine the real controversy between the parties; unless this test is satisfied the amendment cannot be allowed. It seems that the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division on the material on records as available in the present case failed to appreciate the real issue involved in this cage between the parties and wrongly allowed the amendment. In the case reported in <strong><em>9 DLR 217</em></strong> it has been specifically observed that the amendment of the written statement could be allowed provided it is not <em>malafide</em>, belated and that it relates to the point in controversy. The ratio of these two decisions have not been correctly appreciated by the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division in deciding this case. Mr. SR Paul, learned Advocate appearing for the appellant, has submitted some decisions of this court, High Court Division and of Indian jurisdiction for appreciating the true scope of amendment of pleadings. In the case of <strong><em>Golam Hafiz Mia Vs. Khadem Ali Miah, 29 DLR(SC) 311</em></strong> this court observed as follows :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"In exercising this power, the court would no doubt, be reluctant to allow such an amendment which would have the effect of totally altering the nature of the suit, or take away a valuable right accrued by lapse of time, but where in the circumstances of the particular case, it would be plainly inequitable to refuse a relief, the court will not hesitate to act."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case reported in <strong><em>41 DLR 190</em></strong><em>, </em>my learned brother <strong>Mustafa Kamal J</strong> as his Lordship then was observed that the defendant would not be allowed to introduce an alternative and completely different kind of defence both in terms of content and form which will have the effect of introducing a new controversy between the parties which, in fact, did not exist before. In the case of <strong><em>Narsingh Prasad Paul Vs. Still Products Ltd. AIR </em>(1953) <em>(Cal) </em>15,</strong> it has been observed that awarding of costs against amending party does not necessarily avoid prejudice as the primary consideration in the amendment of written statement is the determination of real controversy between the parties.<br/> <br/>10. From the materials on record, it appears that the evidence on the side of the plaintiff's having been closed and all the plaintiffs witnesses having been examined and cross‑examined, a completely new story was attempted to be added in the additional written statement by giving a go‑bye to the earlier case of monthly tenancy and in that place a case of permanent tenancy on payment of salami and making out a case of reconstruction of the premises incurring an expenditure of Taka 1,75,000.00 was attempted to be introduced. As a matter of fact no papers and documents were annexed with this additional written statement showing payment of salami nor any tangible paper of expenditure of the reconstruction was filed. It appears that a new and vague story has been set up at a subsequent point of time only to save the monthly tenancy on the plea of permanent tenancy and to delay the disposal of the case. It also appears that the learned Single Judge failed to consider that contesting defendant No. 7 was not only the son of defendant No. 1 and nephew of defendant Nos. 2 and 3, but was also the constituted attorney of defendant Nos. 1, 2 and 3. In the additional written statement also there is no averment that the defendant No. 7 was not aware of this new story of permanent settlement as set up or defendant Nos. 1-3 were not aware of the contents of the written statement filed in their behalf. On the materials on record, the learned Single Judge ought to have held that the amendment of the written statement was not <em>bonafide</em>.<br/> <br/>11. It may be mentioned here that the learned Single Judge, of course, observed in his judgment that there is inordinate delay in filing this application for amendment of the written statement but he allowed this by holding that the same can be compensated by giving money and consequently awarded cost of Taka 1000.00 as compensation to the plaintiffs. It must be stated here that the principle guiding the amendment of the written statement as contemplated under the law has not been taken note of and the learned Single Judge allowed these revision cases taking a sympathetic view in the matter which is not permitted by law. Thus, considering the entire facts and circumstances of the case and the law governing the amendment of the written statement, we are of the view that the orders passed by the learned Single Judge need be set aside. Since we are setting aside the order of amendment of the written statement, the other order relating to recalling of PW I is necessarily set aside.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, both the appeals are allowed without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
