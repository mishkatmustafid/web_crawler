R. Mudassir Husain CJ.</u></strong><br/> <br/>The defendant is seeking leave to appeal against the judgment and order dated 25th March, 2003 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 5731 of 2001 discharging the Rule.<br/> <br/>2. The facts, leading to this petition, are that the plaintiff-respondents filed Other Suit No. 161 of 2000, alleging, inter alia, that the owners of the property described in C.S. Dage No. 248 under Khatian No. 324 were Lalkha, Isha Kha, Ali Kha, Zion Kha, Mia Kha and Guda Kha; that the schedule property devolved upon Isha Kha, which is stated in Khatian No. 324 that Isha Kha transferred 52 decimals of land from northern side on 03-11-1915 during C.S. operation to Sheikh Falu and Tilumuddin that Sheikh Falu died leaving his share of 25 decimals of land for his daughters namely Bashiron, Apon and brother Tilumuddin.Thereafter, Apon died leaving her husband Tomizuddin and sister Bashiron; that Tomizuddin and Boshiran then sold their shares (13+4 1/3) to defendant No.3; Tilumuddin sold his share (25+8  1/2 ) to his son defendant No.1 Abul Kashem and the deeds are in posses­sion of defendant No.3; that Isha Kha possessed 45 decimals of land and he died leaving behind wife and son namely Santon and Chand Kha and S.A. Khatian No. 396 was prepared in the name of Chand Kha but wrongly S.A. record was not prepared in the name of Tilumuddin, Samiron, Alimuddin and Sonaban that Chand Kha possessed all the land; that Abul Hashem and Abul Kashem trans­ferred 52 decimals of land from the north­ern side to Chand Kha on 16-01-1969; that Chand Kha transferred suit land on 19-09-1984 to plaintiff Nos. 1-5 but wrongly 65 decimals of land was prepared in the name of defendant No. 3 in R.S. record, that 65 decimals of land was transferred by the defendant Nos.1 and 3; that Sonaban after the death of Is a Kha mar­ried Hazi Rowshan Ali and she gave birth to a daughter named Somortoban and Sonaban died leaving behind one son, one daughter and husband namely Chand Kha, Somortoban and Rawshan Ali respective­ly; that under Khatian No. 293 of the S.A. record, 32 decimals of land was recorded in the name of Chand Kha instead of 45 decimals of land; that plaintiff Nos. 1-5 purchased the share of Rawshan Ali from his heirs on 03-05-1992 and 27-07-1992 vide two registered deeds and rented the land to one Nurul Islam for an amount of Tk. 52,000/- yearly for five years; that on 10-11-1997, the defendants went to the house of the plaintiffs at about 7/8 hours and threatened to dispossess the plaintiffs from the suit land and they (plaintiffs) filed the suit. The plaintiffs further stated that they again rented the scheduled prop­erty to Modhumoty Super Bricks on 30-07-1999 but the said agreement is lying with the lessee and as a result, the plain­tiffs could not file the agreement.<br/> <br/>3. The defendant contested the suit by fil­ing written statement, contending, inter-alia, that Sheikh Tilumuddin became owner of 39 decimals of land when Sheikh Kalu died leaving his two daughters namely Boshiron and Apon and brother Sheikh Tilumuddin; that Isha Kha verbal­ly transferred 19.50 acres of land to Alimuddin and Khidir Kha after taking money; that Salam Patwary purchased 32.50 decimals of land from the heirs of Falu and from Azimuddin and Khidir Kha; that Salam Patwary thereafter trans­ferred 32.50 decimals of land to Sahara Khatun and accordingly became owner of 71.50 decimals of land out of 97 decimals of land; that the plaintiffs have no right, title and interest over the suit land and they brought the suit upon false averments and as such the suit is liable to be dis­missed.<br/> <br/>4. Upon hearing the parties, the trial Court dismissed the suit by judgment and decree dated 10-10-2000 and against which the plaintiff-respondents preferred    Title Appeal No. 759 of 2000 in the Court of District Judge, Dhaka, which on transfer was heard by the learned Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Additional Artha Rin Adalat No.1, who allowed the appeal upon setting aside the judgment and decree of the trial Court. The petitioner being thus aggrieved moved the High Court Division in revi­sion and preferred Civil Revision No. 5731 of 2001 which was heard by the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division, who discharged the Rule by affirming the judgment of the lower Appellate Court and thereby decreed the suit.<br/> <br/>5. Mr.Md.Nawab Ali, the learned Advocate-on-Record appearing for the petitioner, placed before us the impugned judgment of the High Court Division as well as the judgments of the Courts below. In  support  of the  leave-petition, Mr. Nawab Ali contends that the High Court Division failed to consider that the Appellate Court failed to apply its judicial mind in not considering that the plaintiffs are not in possession in the suit property and as such injunction can not be granted to one, who is not in possession thereby the High Court Division having affirmed the decision of the Appellate Court com­mitted an error of law resulting in an error in the decision causing failure of justice.<br/> <br/>6. The next submission made by Mr. Nawab Ali is that the basis of claim of the plaintiff-respondents is Exhibit-4, which is a certified copy of the deed and the orig­inal of which having not been filed nor an explanation was given as to where the original document is lying and in such view  of the  matter,  the  High  Court Division ought to have found that the aforesaid  certified  copy  of the  deed Exhibit-4 is not genuine one and the High Court Division having failed to consider this aspect committed and error of law in discharging the Rule and as such the find­ings and decisions arrived at by the High Court Division are liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/>7. Mr. Enayetur Rahim, the learned Advocate appearing for the respondent Nos.1-5, on the other hand, contended that the High Court Division having con­sidered both oral and documentary evi­dence on record found that the lower Appellate Court being the final Court of fact came to correct decision to the effect that the plaintiff-respondents succeeded in proving their right, title and possession in the suit land and are entitled to permanent injunction.<br/> <br/>8.  Mr. Nawab Ali, being confronted with above submissions of the learned Advocate for the respondents, finds diffi­culty to support the judgment and decree of the trial Court dismissing the plaintiff’s suit.<br/> <br/>9. We have heard the learned lawyers of both the parties and considered their submissions. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and the materi­als on record, we find that the High Court Division rightly passed the impugned order and we are fully in agreement with the findings and decisions arrived at by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>In the aforesaid premises, we find no substance in this petition.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, it is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
