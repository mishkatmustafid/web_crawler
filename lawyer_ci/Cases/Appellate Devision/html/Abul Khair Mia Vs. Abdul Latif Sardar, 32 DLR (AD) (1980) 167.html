Plaintiff appellant instituted Title Suit No. 3 of 1966 in the 3rd Court of Subordi­nate Judge, Dacca against the respondents for ejectment after termination of tenancy under section 109 of the Transfer of Property Act. The suit was filed on 12-1-66 and it was decreed on 23-2-66 ex-parte. The decree was put into execution immediately and the Process Server went to the suit property on 21-3-66 to execute the decree. The plaintiffs' case is that the defendant obs­tructed the Process Server. However, even­tually, the respondents were evicted from the premises with the police help on 5-6-66. Res­pondents filed an application under Order 9, rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure on 9-6-68, to set aside ex parte decree which led to the Miscellaneous Case No. 93 of 1966.<br/> <br/>3. The trial Court found that the processes were served in accordance with law. The petition was barred by limitation because the defendant had knowledge of the decree as far back as on 21-3-66 when be first resisted Process Server and accordingly dismissed the miscellaneous case. The Appellate Court below, however, found that the summons were suppressed and the exparte decree was obtained fraudulently and therefore, the decree was liable to be set aside but the Miscellaneous Case was barred by limitation inasmuch as the defendant had knowledge of the decree when the Process Server was obstructed in executing the writs of attachment and delivery of possession on 21-3-66. In this view of the matter the appeal was dismissed. On revision the High Court Division, however, noticed that the two mokabila witnesses were not exa­mined and the evidence of the Process Server did not inspite any confidence. Moreover, the evidence of the defendant was not at all considered by the Courts below and therefore, the High Court Division arrived at the conclusion that the finding that the judgment-debtor had knowledge of the decree on 21-3-66 was perverse. The High Court Division further noticed that the summons bad been suppressed and the decree was obtained ex parte fraudulently. This finding of fact was arrived at by the appellate Court below also. The High Court Division considered that this finding was arrived at on evidence and then it proceeded to consi­der the nature of such decree and observed that the decree-holder by his own act got a fraudulent decree and in pursuance of that took possession of the premises and demo­lished the building and reconstructed a new one. It observed further that the decree-holder could not be allowed to take advantage of his own fraud. In this view of the matter the ex parte decree was set aside and the case was sent back to the trial Court for disposal of the suit in accordance with law. Leave was granted to consider:—<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(1) Whether an enquiry as to if an ex parte decree is void falls within the scope of Order IX, rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure;<br/>(2) Whether the ex parte decree passed in the suit was a void decree simply because of the plaintiff having suppressed the sum­mons even if fraudulently and;<br/>(3) Whether the learned Judges of the High Court Division were within their jurisdiction in appraising the evidence af­resh in revision and disturbing the concur­rent finding of fact arrived at by the lear­ned subordinate Judge and the Additional District Judge on the question as to whether on 21.3.66 the judgment-debtor being present in the suit premises obstructed the process server in executing the writs of attachment and delivery of possession and thus came to know of the suit and the decree at least on that date.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>4. This fact as disclosed by the evidence is that the decree-holder by suppressing summons obtained the ex parts decree fraudulently and this finding of fact has been arrived at both by the appellate Court below and the High Court Division. Such decree obtained fraudulently is a nullity in the eye of law. It is by practising deceit and fraud that the decree was obtained and when such fraud and deceit is established, a decree has no existence in the eye of law and it must be set aside. Such enquiry is permissible within the scope of Order IX, rule 13 of the Code of Civil Pro­cedure because the term of the rule itself pro­vides for setting aside the exparte decree if it is obtained, inter alia, by suppressing the sum­mons. It is not the question of re-assessment of the evidence in revisional jurisdiction. The finding of fact arrived at by the last Court of fact, namely, the appellate Court below, is that summons were fraudulently suppressed and once the fraud is established, limitation will run only from the date when the fraud was detected. It is contrary to the essence of justice to saddle a person with knowledge of an ex parte decree which apparently was built up on the theory that the Process Server was resisted in the execution of the decree. In this context the High Court Division considered the evidence and found that the finding was perverse, namely, that the judgment-debtor had resisted the Process Ser­ver on 21-3-66 and, therefore, the period of limitation will run from that date. If fraud is proved then there is no question of limitation. Reliance may be placed in the cases of <em>Abdul Rauf vs. Abdul Harnid Khan, (1965) 17 DLR (SC) 515-PLD 1965 (S.C.), 671</em> and <em>Saifur Rahman vs. Haider Shah, 19 DLR (SC), 433</em>.<br/> <br/>In the result, therefore, this appeal is dismissed with costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>
