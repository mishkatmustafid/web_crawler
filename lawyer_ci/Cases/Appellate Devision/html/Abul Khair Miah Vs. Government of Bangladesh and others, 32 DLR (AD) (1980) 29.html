Facts are that the properties in appeal had been declared as enemy property by the Assistant Custodian of the Enemy Property by his orders dated 29-12-69 and 14-9-70 in E.P. Cases No. 228/70-71, 229/70-71 and 230/70-71. The properties were owned and possessed by (1) Hari Bandhu Nath, son of late Kamini Kumar Nath (2) Promoda Sundari Devi, wife of late Kamini Kumer Nath and (3) Sabitri Prova Devi, wife of late Krishna Bandhu Nath (son of late Kamini Krishna Nath). The property comprised in E.P. Case No. 228/70-71 originally belonged to Gour Chandra Karmakar and others and then it was transferred to Krishna Sundar Majumder, who in turn, sold the same to Kamini Kumar Nath by a registered Kabala dated 27.10 43. Kamini Kumar Nath was in possession of the property since his purchase. Kamini Kumar mortgaged the property to Nath Bank (Pakistan) Ltd. by a registered deed of mortgage dated 28-12- 44. The Bank filed Mortgage Suit No. 84 of 1954 in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Noakhali against the mortgage on the death of Kamini Kumar, Promoda Sundari Devi and Sabitri Devi were substituted in his place. The suit was disposed of on compromise on 22.8.75. It was claimed that Hari Bandhu Nath, Promoda Sundari Devi and Sabitri Devi were nationals of Bangladesh by birth and were permanent residents of Noakhali District and they never migrated to India either after parti­tion or during the Indo-Pakistan War, 1965 nor during the liberation war of 1971. Hari Bandhu Nath, Promoda Sundari and Sabitri Devi sold these properties to the deceased appellant and his son and brother and others by registered kabalas dated 19-8-75 (registered on 70-8 75) It was alleged that respondent Md. Golam Mostafa, a neighbor was trying to grab the  property. He moved the authority to treat the said property as ab­andoned property but when he failed in his attempt, he got the property declared as ene­my property by unfair means. An enquiry was made into the matter to ascertain whether the property was an enemy property by Mr. S U.M Zahirul Islam, Magistrate, 1st Class, Sadar, Noakhali. The Magistrate submitted his en­quiry report on 3.3.76, 01 examination of witnesses and held that appellant's vendors never migrated to India either in 1947 or in 1965 or in the year 1971. The enquiry report was not accepted by the Joint Secretary, Land Administration &amp; Land Reforms, Administra­tion Division and he held that the property vested as Non-Resident-Property (Administra­tion Cell), and that the property was rightly declared as Enemy Property by the Assistant Custodian. This order was passed on 5.10.76. The appellant being aggrieved by the aforesaid order of the Joint Secretary moved the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Con­stitution.<br/> <br/>3. The dispute centred round the question whether the vendors of the deceased appellant migrated from the then East Pakistan some time before the war of Indo-Pakistan in 1965. The High Court Division held that it was a disputed question of fact and so it could not be decided in the writ jurisdiction, and the lea­rned Judges were of the view that the order passed by the Enemy Property authority dec­laring the property as enemy would stand and that is under challenge.<br/> <br/>4. Leave was granted to consider whether the High Court Division has rightly allocated the onus on the appellant about the migration of his vendors and whether the property could be declared as enemy property in 1975 and whether the High Court Division was correct in holding that the question of migration being a disputed fact the order of the Enemy Pro­perty authority would stand.<br/> <br/>5. On hearing Mr. M. H. Khondker, lear­ned Counsel for the appellant and Mr. Anwarul Huq Chowdhury,  Deputy Attorney-General who appeared on 26-11-79 for Respondents 1 and 2, it appears that a question of law was raised in the writ petition which the learned Judges of the High Court Division have not considered but which has a bearing on the merit of writ petition in that the property in question was mortgaged to Nath Bank by the predecessor of the vendors of the appellant and the mortgage suit was compromised and the property released in favour of the vendors of the appellant who got the property by a Kabala and also got possession. If the property was declared an enemy property, it is not ex­plained how the mortgage suit could proceed till 1975 long after coming into operation of the enemy property laws without the said au­thority being impleaded. Apart from this, the appellant has asserted his possession in the property and the Government in their affidavit-in-opposition, though have challenged the va­lidity of the sale deeds, yet have admitted that the appellant was in possession after his pur­chase on 20-8-75. On these unchallenged facts, we come to the first question to see whether the High Court Division has allocated the onus on the parties on right principle. The other grounds of the leave order are dependant on the first facts. The High Court Division has proceeded on the basis that the appellant has not been able to establish that the predecessor of the vendors of the appellant or they never migrated to India, a fact which bas been cha­racterised as a disputed one on which the High Court Division has refrained from deciding. It is an admitted case of both parties that the predecessors of the appellant were Pakistani nationals and the appellant on purchase of the property from his vendors is in possession of the property, and it requires to be explai­ned by the Enemy Property authority or the Government, which has not been attempted at all, how the property could be treated as enemy property. It was for the Enemy Property authority, in the premises of the facts to establish that the predecessor of the vendors of the appellant or they, in fact, migrated to India earlier to the Enemy Property law came into operation in 1965, so that the property left by them came within the mischief of enemy property law but the High Court Division has erroneously assumed as a fact which the Ene­my Property authority was to prove. The onus was misplaced on the appellant. This finding which is based on wrong allocation of onus cannot be sustained. It has been stated earlier that the appellant's possession of the property, the pendency of the mortgage suit from 1954, to 1975 and the total lack of any evidence from the side of Enemy Property authority that the vendors of the appellants ever migrated to In­dia make it manifest that, the challenged order declaring the property in question as enemy property was without jurisdiction. The decision on the first ground covers the third ground of leave order and the appeal succeeds on these two grounds, and so the second need not be discussed in this appeal. In that view of the matter, the order of the High Court Division cannot stand.<br/> <br/>In the result, this appeal is allowed without any order as to cost. The order of the High Court Division is set aside and the impugned order of the Enemy Property authority is de­clared to be illegal and without any lawful authority.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
