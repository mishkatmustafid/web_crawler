Plaintiffs-respondents claim title and possession of the land by Pattan from the admittedly original owner, Sunil Chandra Ghosh. But when defendant No. 7, claiming to be a lessee of the Government, threatened the plaintiffs with dispossession, they filed the suit in question (Title Suit No. 215 of 1984) for declaration of title and confirmation of possession, etc. The suit was decreed by the trial Court namely, the Assistant Judge, Manikganj, and his decision was upheld by the District Judge. Thereupon defendant No. 5, Additional Deputy Commissioner, Manikganj, challenged the decision in revision, (Civil Order No. 982 of 1991); but it was summarily dismissed by a learned Single Judge of the High Court Division by the impugned order dated 27 March, 1991. Petitioner is now seeking leave to appeal from the said order.<br/> <br/>2. Mr. Moksudur Rahman, learned Advocate for the petitioner, contends that the concurrent finding of facts arrived at by the trial Court and the appellate Court is not based on proper consideration of the evidence. Evidence on record shows that Wahab Ali, predecessor-in- interest of the plaintiffs, took the Pattan from Sunil Chandra Ghosh, some time in 1351‑52 BS, went into possession of the land and his name was recorded in the SA Khatian. On the other hand, there is no convincing evidence that the Government ever took over possession of the land as an enemy property, subsequently, vested property, and that there is no basis for the lease as claimed by defendant No. 7. In the face of this evidence, we find no substance in the contention of Mr. Moksudur Rahman. The summary rejection of the revisional application is perfectly justified.<br/> <br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
