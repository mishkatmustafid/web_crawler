How we wish such case had never come before the Court. It was a transferred suit being Transferred Suit No.1 of 1980. Suit was filed originally in the Court of Munsif, Noakhali being Other Class Suit No. 337 of 1978. It was filed on 2.6.1979 against the Deputy Commissioner and Ad­ditional Deputy Commissioner (Development) for a decree of mandatory injunction directing Respondent No. 1 Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) to vacate the suit premises for accommodation of the plaintiff-appellant, who is a judicial officer.<br/> <br/>2. The plaintiffs case was that the suit premis­es was the official residence of the District Judge, Noakhali since the British regime and it was made over to the then Department of Law of the Govern­ment of Bengal. After partition it was the official residence of the District Judge. However, later on of­ficial residence of the District Judge was constructed at Maijdi and the then District Judge, Mr. S. Rah­man, accordingly shifted to the new residence at Maijdi. The trouble started from here. The then Ad­ditional Deputy Commissioner Mr. Pervez Mazumder entered into the suit premises allegedly without the consent of the District Judge or the Law Depart­ment and even without any allotment from the Dis­trict Accommodation Board. At about this time in April, 1979 Mr. Pervez Mazumder was transferred. The District Judge informed the Deputy Commis­sioner that the plaintiff should be accommodated in the vacant premises and it was pointed out by the District Judge that another quarter was lying vacant which could be allotted to the successor of Mr. Majumder and suggested "the suit premises be returned to his Judgeship for accommodation of the petition­er. "The District Judge informed the Law Ministry and it appears, the Law Department by its Memo dated 18.5.79, requested the Deputy Commissioner to return the premises to the possession of the Dis­trict Judge "to solve the problem of the accommoda­tion of the judicial officer." It seems meanwhile de­fendant No. 1 had entered into the suit premises on verbal permission from the Deputy Commissioner. The bone of contention was that such permission by Deputy Commissioner was illegal and without juris­diction. Issues were framed by the learned Munsif and it was set down for peremptory hearing. In April, 1979 defendant No. 1 moved the High Court Division under section 24 of the Code of Civil Pro­cedure being Civil Revision Case No. 1020 of 1979 praying that the suit be withdrawn by the High Court Division and upon hearing the parties the prayer was allowed and it was registered as Trans­ferred Suit No. 1 of 1980.<br/> <br/>3. The matter was heard by A.T.M. Afzal, J. It was noticed that in the suit as framed the only relief of mandatory injunction was sought against defendant No. 1 and no relief had been prayed for as against the Deputy Commissioner proforma defendant.<br/> <br/>4. The learned Judge found no evidence to show that the suit premises was ever handed over to the Law Department or that it vested in the Law Ministry. At the longest plaintiff claimed the suit premises was occupied by the Judicial Officers since 1920. Next, it was found that no evidence had been produced to show that the suit premises was ear­marked for judicial officers as claimed by the plain­tiff. Exhibit Q dated 20.7.71 shows that the District Accommodation Board had been dealing with the suit premises for the purpose of allotment since 1971. It is no doubt that if this is an earmarked residence for a judicial officer, in case of its falling vacant, it is the District Judge who accords permission for its occupation vide Exhibits 20 and 21 series. The learned Judge concluded-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“Therefore, it appears to me that there is no reliable evidence in support of the plaintiffs case that the suit premises is a departmental quarter earmarked for judicial officer."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In this view of the matter the learned single Judge concluded that there being no valid and lawful order of allotment in favour of plaintiff No. 1 and no legal right had inured in his favour giving rise to a cause of action for mandatory injunction and finally concluded-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Notwithstanding the decision in this suit I shall expect that the suggestion of the District Judge will be given due consideration by all concerned with a spirit of understanding and accommodation and not with an air of belliger­ence."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>5. Leave was granted to consider the correct­ness of the decision of the learned single Judge in view of the certain exhibit namely, Exhibit 1 and 2 and whether the learned Judge was correct that the defendant had no obligation within the meaning of sec­tion 55 of the Specific Relief Act which contemplates the legal obligation pursuant to the order of the allotment made by the District Judge.<br/> <br/>6. On analysis of the evidence it is found that the Law Ministry by Memo dated 8.6.79 kept the or­der dated 18.5.79 in abeyance and that order (Exhibit A) had not been vacated. The crucial question is whether the foundation for the order of the District Judge for allotting the premises to the plaintiff is sufficiently laid on the face of the order of the Law Ministry dated 18.5.79 and when the same had been kept in abeyance whether any cause of action could be built upon such order. The case was decided on this point and there is no scope for technical view on the question of legal obligation so as to attract sec­tion 55 of the Specific Relief Act.<br/> <br/>Obligation includes every duty enforceable by law (Section 3). In the present case it is not the case of the plaintiff that the obligation arises from any contract. Therefore, the obligation must rest on law. The plaintiff could not cite any law which raises such obligation the breach of which would give rise to a cause of action.<br/> <br/>Section 55 is in following terms:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"When to prevent the breach of an obliga­tion, it is necessary to compel the performance of certain acts which the Court is capable of en­forcing, the Court may, in its discretion, grant an injunction to prevent the breach complained of, and also to compel performance of the requi­site acts."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>7. Mr. Khondkar Mahbubuddin Ahmed, appear­ing for the appellant, frankly submitted that he could not argue the case on the footing of "breach of any obligation" but the consistent occupation of the house by the District Judge should be taken that the house had been earmarked for judicial officers. It is difficult to accept the point. Because where the use of properly is permissive and not as of right no case is made out for injunction far less a question of mandatory injunction. The obligation referred to in this section means a legal obligation and not a moral obligation.<br/> <br/>8. So much for the law. But certain things which have cropped up in evidence cannot be overlooked. When the District Judge by his Memo No. 1054/E dated 12.4.79 informed the Deputy Commis­sioner, Noakhali that since Mr. Pervez Majumdar has left, the plaintiff No 1 may be accommodated in the quarter in question and pointed out another quar­ter was lying vacant which may accommodate the Additional Deputy Commissioner—the Deputy Commissioner remained silent though he received the Memo. The District Judge then informed the Law Department through Registrar of the High Court Division stating the facts and solicited neces­sary action. The Law Department by Memo. No. 117- Judl. 9/1-9/79 dated 18.5.79 informed the Dep­uty Commissioner to hand over the vacant posses­sion of the quarter at the disposal of the District Judge so as "to solve the problem of accommodation of the Judicial Officers." A copy of this letter was sent to the Secretary, Establishment Division also. Whereupon the District Judge made necessary allot­ment serving copy of such order the Deputy Commissioner still took no action and when the Nazir, Judge Court, went to make arrangement for shifting of the plaintiff on 31.5.79 he found the premises was already occupied by defendant No. 1 and the de­fendant No.1 informed the Nazir that on the verbal permission of the Deputy Commissioner he has oc­cupied the premises. In spite of the request of the Nazir the Additional Deputy Commissioner, defen­dant No. 1, refused to vacate the premises.<br/> <br/>9. The facts are not disputed. They reveal nothing but the officiousness of the Additional Deputy Commissioner. It is unfortunate that in this backdrop the responsible Officers of the District Administration could ignore with impunity the arrangement that has been made by the District Judge following the letter of the Law Ministry. If it is intended to show officiousness of bygone days of the servants of East India Company openly attempting to flout the order of the Bengal Supreme Court, then it must be said that much water has flown by in the Buriganga ever since then. The country is governed by a Con­stitutional Government and the minimum norm that is expected of the persons participating in the Ad­ministration is to keep harmony in the dealings inter se lest an impression is created that each department is at loggerheads with the other which means any­thing but system of orderly Government. The learned Single Judge by dismissing the suit voiced this sen­timent when he said, "the suggestion of the District Judge will be given due consideration by all con­cerned with a spirit of understanding and accommoda­tion and not with an air of belligerence." We would not like to say anything more because in the setting of facts in this case the less said the better. With this observation, this appeal is disposed of without any order as to cost.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
