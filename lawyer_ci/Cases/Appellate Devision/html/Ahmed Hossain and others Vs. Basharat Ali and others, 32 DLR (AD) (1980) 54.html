Facts relevant for consideration of the question are that the appellant petitioners pur­chased several parcels of land from five raiyati holdings by a registered kabala dated May 5, 1965. Respondents No. 1 to 5 claiming to be tenants of the holdings, contiguous to the lands transferred and described in the schedules to the application, prayed for pre-emption under section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950, hereinafter referred to the as "the Act". Schedule 1 consists of a tank only. The appellants contested the pre-emption case on various grounds, <em>inter alia</em> that absence of contiguity between the lands by reason of exis­tence of a public pathway, prayer for pre-emp­tion could not be allowed. The  Sub-ordinate Judge accepted the pre-emptor's case of having land contiguous to schedule 1 land only, allow­ed pre-emption in respect of the plots. He held that the pathway admittedly being belong­ing to the government and there being no ad­verse possession against the government, it will not be a case of intervening land belonging to others to deprive the pre-emptor  from claim­ing pre-emption on the ground of contiguity. On appeal, the order of pre-emption was affirmed. On revision a Division Bench of the High Court refused to interfere in the matter and approved the view taken by the Courts below. The disputed lands are in five different holdings recorded in different khatians and the plots are also not in one compact block but are close to each other in a zigzag way and the pre-emptors have only land on the north of schedule 1 (tank), intervened by a public pathway be­longing to the government. The public path­way has been recorded separately in the khas khatian of government. The Sub­ordinate Judge considered the pathway as a 'hyphen', and as there is no case of adverse possession against the government. According to him "the pathway will not be blocked to the contiguous landholder who has come to claim pre-emption of the adjoining path way and that the pathway legally be understood as a hyphen. "The Additional District Judge considered the pathway as "to be a part, and parcel of the tank, because, the pathway is the only entrance to the tank. The learned Judge of the High Court Division repelling the contention of the pre-emptees that the government pathway severed contiguity between the pre-emptors' land and schedule 1 tank observed:—<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"In the case before us what intervenes between the purchased land and the pre-emptors' land is the public pathway which belongs to no individual member of the public and as such it does not come in conflict with any particular per­son's right to pre-empt under section 96 of the Act. In the absence of any one having a competing interest with that of the pre-emptor it cannot be said that because of a certain space recorded as public pathway in the name of govern­ment the contiguity between the pur­chased land and the pre-emptors' land is lost and the right to pre-empt under section 96 of the Act reaches the vani­shing point".</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>3. A person claiming pre-emption on the ground of having land contiguous to the land transferred can succeed only when he satisfies the requirement of the statute. What sense the expression "contiguous to the land transferred" purports to convey is to be deter­mined with reference to the different provisions of section 96 of the Act, otherwise, consi­deration of the expression solely on the basis of the dictionary meaning of the word 'contiguity' or ''contiguous" may lead to a conclusion which may not be consistent with the language of statute and in conformity with the object of the legislation. When a phraseology of an enactment is clear and un­ambiguous and capable of one and only one interpretation, it is not open to the Court to give a different interpretation, with a view to carry out which is supposed to be the intention of the legislature.  But if the phra­seology used in the statute or in a section of the statute is capable of two interpretations, the interpretation which is consistent with the object of the enactment is to be preferred to the interpretation that would nullify that object. In interpreting a word or phraseology used in a statute the Court is to presume that the legislature has used the word with a pur­pose. It is an accepted canon of interpretation that the words in a statute must be taken to be used correctly and   exactly, and not loosely or inexactly. Dictionary may be refer­red to just find out the ordinary meaning of the word used in the English language, but interpretation by relying on dictionary has been deprecated. To find out the sense "co­ntiguous” carries, it is to be   considered in what context the word has been employed in the statute, and in doing so, if necessary, dic­tionary may be referred only to  find   out the ordinary meaning of the word.<br/> <br/>4. Now let us examine in what context the word "contiguous" has been used in the statute. Sub-section 96 of the Act reads as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">''96.(1) If a portion or share of a hol­ding of a raiyat is transferred, one or more co-sharer tenants of the holding may within four months of the service of the notice given under section 89, or, if no notice has been served under section 89, within four months of the date of knowledge of the transfer, apply to the Court for the said portion or share to be transferred to himself or themselves; and if a holding or a por­tion of a share of a holding is trans­ferred, the tenant or tenants holding land contiguous to the land transferred may, within 4 months of the date of the knowledge of such transfer, apply to the Court for the holding or portion or share to be transferred to himself or themselves:<br/> <br/>Provided that no co-sharer tenant or tenants holding land contiguous to purchase under this section unless he is a person to whom transfer of the hol­ding or the portion or share thereof, as the case may be, can be made."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>5. Section 96 provides right of pre-emp­tion of two categories. Firstly, it gives the right of pre emption to the co-sharer tenants of the holding; and, secondly, it gives right of pre­emption to the tenant holding land contiguous to the land transferred For proper interpre­tation of the expression "contiguous to the land transferred" it is to be first seen as to whether the word 'contiguous' has been employed by the Legislature correctly and exactly or loosely and inexactly. Exact use and the purpose of using the word "contigu­ous" in sub section (!) of section 96 is to be found out in the light of the use of the word in other provisions in section 96 Sub­section (2) requires that in an application by a tenant holding land contiguous to the land transferred, all the co-sharer tenants of the holding and all the tenants holding lands contiguous to the lands transferred and the transferee shall be made parties. Sub-section (4), <em>inter alia</em>, gives right to the tenants-hol­ding land contiguous to the land trans­ferred to apply to join in the application filed under sub-section (1) of section 96 of the Act by a tenant holding land contiguous to the land transferred. Sub-section 5(b) provides the procedure for determining the order of priority in a case where more than one tenant holding land contiguous to the land trans­ferred apply for pre-emption. Clause (b) of sub-section (5) reads as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"(b) If more than one tenant holding land contiguous to the land transferred apply under this section, the Court shall determine the order of priority as among such tenants having regard to—<br/>(i) The total quantity of land in possession of each of the tenants applying:<br/>(ii) whether the contiguous land of the tenant is homestead land or any other class of land;<br/>(iii) extent of contiguity;<br/>(iv) to what extent it is necessary for the applicant to have possession of the con­tiguous land; and<br/>(v) the right of easement, if any, of the applicants."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From a reading of clause (b) of sub-section (5) it appears that the words  ‘contiguous' and ‘contiguity' have been used to convey their exact meaning and it is not a case of the words being used loosely and inexactly. "Ex­tent of contiguity" being one of criteria for determining the order of priority when more than one tenant holding land contiguous to the land transferred apply, for preemption it leaves no doubt that the word 'contiguous' as used in sub-section ( 1) means "touching", “adjacent" but not "neighbouring".<br/> <br/>6. Mr. M.H. Khondker, the learned Coun­sel for the appellants contended that although it was specifically stated in the written objec­tion that the transferred lands appertaining to five different raiyati  holding are not even in one compact block ; and the pre-emptors also have no land contiguous  to the lands trans­ferred; and that even the schedule 1 land (tank) is  admittedly intervened by a government pathway, yet the Courts below, on erroneous view of the  word 'contiguous', allowed  the pre-emption case. He further contended that the learned judges of this High Court Division while approving the decision of the Courts be­low took an erroneous  view that the word 'contiguous' is synonymous to the words ‘adjoining', and the word cannot be construed as touching and, in this respect, the learned Judges referred to the case of <em><strong>Haynes v. King (1893) Ch. 349.</strong></em> The learned Counsel submit­ted that the right of pre-emption given to "a tenant having land contiguous to the land tran­sferred'' is to some extent akin to the pro­vision of pre-emption as allowed under the Mohamadan Law to "owners of adjoining immovable property", known as <em>Shafi-i-jar</em>. According to the learned Counsel the learned Judges of the High Court Division without properly appreciating the nature of pre-emption as allowed under section 96 to a tenant hold­ing land contiguous to the land transferred and in spite of noticing the land of pre-emptors is not contiguous to the land trans­ferred  in the strict sense  of the term, took the erroneous view that the intervening path­way being a government pathway and in the absence of any one having a competing in­terest with that of the pre-emptors it cannot be said that because of certain space recorded as public pathway in the name of the Govern­ment the contiguity between the purchased land and the pre-emptors' land is lost, and. the right of pre-emption under section 96 of the Act is not available.<br/> <br/>7. With reference to the case <em><strong>Haynes v. King </strong></em>Mr. M. H. Khondkar submitted that the word 'contiguous' has been construed as "neighbouring" in the  context of the facts of the case, but on the same analogy the word 'contiguous' as occurring in section 96 can­not be given the loose meaning of 'adjoining', 'neighbouring' etc. First requirement to be fulfilled by a pre-emptor claiming pre-emption on the ground of having contiguous land, is to show contiguity of his land, that is, the pre-emptors' land must be touching with the land transferred. Mr M.H. Khondkar re­ferred  to a decision in the case of <em><strong>Spillers Limited vs. Cardiff (Borough) Assessment Com­mittee and Pritchard (1931) 2 K. B. 21</strong></em> wherein the word 'contiguous' occurring in a statute has been interpreted as "touching" and  not "neighbouring" ; and the interpretation given to the word  'contiguous' in <em><strong>Haynes vs. King</strong></em> has been commented upon.<br/> <br/>8. In the instant case pre-emption has been allowed on the view that when a tenant claiming pre-emption can show contiguity of the land to any parcel of the lands transferred by a sale deed, is entitled to pre­empt all the lands transferred. While consi­dering the question of contiguity of land the word 'contiguous' has been interpreted in a way that a pre-emptor may claim pre­emption even on the basis of laud not touching with the land under pre-emption and giving the  meaning "neighbouring"' or "adjoining". Admittedly the land of the pre-emptors and one of the lands transferred is intervened by a government pathway, but the existence of this pathway has not been found sufficient to sever conti­guity.<br/> <br/>9. Under the Mohamadan Law the right of Shufaa or pre-emption is a right which the owner of an Immovable property possesses to acquire by purchase another immovable property which has been sold to another. Three classes of persons are en­titled to claim pre-emption, namely: (1) a co-sharer in the property <em>(shafi-i-sharik</em>); (2) a participator in immunities and appendages, such as a right of way or a right to discharge water (<em>shafi-i-khalit</em>); and (3) owners of adjoining immovable property <em>(Shafi-i-jar</em>). The first class excludes the second and the second excludes the third. Under section 96 the right of pre-emption has been given to two classes of persons, namely; (1) one or more co-sharer tenants of the holding, if a portion or share of a holding of a raiyat is transferred; and (2) the tenant or tenants holding land con­tiguous to the land transferred, if a holding or a portion or part of a holding is transferred. Under section 96 no right of pre-emption has been given to a participator in immunities and appendages as such. This right, that is, the right of easement may be taken into considera­tion when more than one applicant claims pre­emption as tenants having land contiguous to the land transferred. Clause (b) of sub-section (5) of Section 95 provides the necessary guida­nce for determining the priority in such a case. Priority of the applicants is to be determined having regard to, (i) the total quantity of land in possession of each of the tenants; (ii) whether the contiguous land of the tenant is homestead land or any other class of land; (iii)extent of contiguity; (iv) to what extent it is necessary for the applicant to have possession of the contiguous land; and (v) the right of easement, if any, of the ap­plicants<br/> <br/>10. The right of pre-emption under sub­section (1) of section 96 given to a tenant having land contiguous to the land transfer­red is a right which has been given in consi­deration of his necessity and not on any other consideration. This right of pre-emption is similar to the right of pre-emption allowed under the Mohamadan Law to the owners of the adjoining immovable property, which is termed as <em>Shafi-i-Jar</em>. Clause (b) of sub­section (5) sufficiently indicates that pre-emptor must shows that his land is contiguous to the land transferred, that is to say, it is touching with the land transferred. Only then he can maintain his claim. In the case of more than one tenant fulfilling the require­ments to claim pre-emption, in determining the order of interise priority one of the cri­teria for consideration is "extent of contigui­ty". If the view taken by the High Court is accepted as correct, then some of the crite­ria as contained in clause (b) would become redundant. Apart from that, it would be di­fficult for the Court to decide the claim of applicants claiming second category of pre­emption. If the word 'contiguous' is given loose meaning connoting 'adjoining' or 'neigh­bouring' no purchaser of land would be sure about his position. In our opinion the word 'contiguous' has not been loosely used by the Legislature, but used it correctly and exactly. In the case of <em><strong>Spillers, Limited vs. Cardiff (Borough) Assessment Committee etc.</strong></em> the word 'contiguous' occurring in sub-section (3) of section 3 of the Rating and Valuation (Apportionment) Act has been construed. In the appeals preferred against the orders of as­sessment made by Assessment Committees, the appellants owned and carried on  undertaking as millers and bakers in Cardiff, and in addi­tion to the said hereditament, the subject of the appeal, they owned the premises within the same curtilage within the meaning of section  3, sub­section (3) of the said Act. It was contended that blocks not being contiguous to one ano­ther and therefore, none of them ought to be deemed contiguous for the purpose of deter­mining as to whether they are industrial heredi­tament. In allowing some of the appeals it was been held that the word 'contiguous' must be construed in its ordinary and  proper sense as meaning 'touching' and not in its loose sense and meaning neighbouring. In the context of the different provisions of the statute and the dictionary meaning of the word 'contiguous' <strong>Lord Hewart C.J.</strong> expressed the  opinion that the expression 'contiguous to' means 'contigu­ous to' and does not mean neighbouring.<br/> <br/>11. Now let us examine what is the diction­ary meaning of the word 'contiguous'. In Stroud's Judicial Dictionary (Fourth Edition) Volume I, the word 'contiguous' has been de­fined as, 'contiguous' means touching and is as nearly as possible the synonym of 'adjoining’. The Oxford English Dictionary gives five mean­ings. The first and principal one touching, in actual contact, next in space; meeting at a common boundary, bordering, adjoining. Dr. Johnson, who is said to have employed the English language with more anxious precision that anybody else, defines the word 'contiguous' in his dictionary; meaning so as to touch ; bordering upon each other; not separate and he gives no other definition.<br/> <br/>12. Faqeer Shahabuddin Ahmed, the learn­ed Counsel appearing for respondents strenu­ously argued in support of the view taken by the High Court Division and for accepting the interpretation of the word 'contiguous' mean­ing 'neighbouring' and not touching. The lear­ned Counsel sought to derive support from the case of <em><strong>Haynes Vs. King</strong></em> wherein the word "contiguous" used in a deed of lease has been interpreted.<br/> <br/>13. The interpretation given therein being in the context of the particular facts of the case does not help the learned Counsel in giving correct interpretation to the word "contiguous". In <em><strong>Haynes Vs. King</strong></em> there was a demise of four houses on the south side of a street with a stipu­lation by the lessor that they should be allow­ed to deal as they thought fit with "any of the premises adjoining or contiguous to the hereditament hereby demised," even if such action diminished of affected the access of light and air to the demised premises. At the date of the lease there were on the north side of the street opposite to the dismissed houses, four old houses also belonging to the lessors. Then, the lessees sought to restrain the re-building of four houses on the north of the street because the re-building diminished the light and air upon the demised premises, it was held by <strong>North, J.</strong> that the four houses on the north side were within the li­berty reserved by the covenant to lessors. One of the questions to be decided was, what is the meaning of the phrase "any of the premises adjoining or contiguous to hereditaments here­by demised". <strong>North, J.</strong> accepted the case of the lessors (defendant) that the four premises on the other side of the street were covered by the covenant. While taking this view the learned Judge observed, "I think the word contiguous' was used there by someone who did not fully understand its meaning. I do not think it was intended to have its strict mean­ing, <em>viz.</em> "touching," because the phrase as ''such adjoining or contiguous promises," and I think the two words, "adjoining" and "conti­guous", were not intended to be merely synonymous but were meant to  be alternative, and that the meaning really was "such adjoining or neighbouring premises". The   interpretation given by <strong>North, J.</strong> was explained by <strong>Lord Hewart, C.J.</strong> in <em><strong>Spillers, Limited Vs. Cardiff (Bo­rough) Assessment Committee</strong></em>. In the reported case the question for consideration was whether a property not "within same  curtilage" could be treated as part of the main "industrial here­ditament" within the meaning of section 3, sub-­section (1) of the Rating and Valuation (Apportionment) Act, 1928 by virtue of the expression "contiguous to" occurring in section 3, sub­section (3) of the Act. In all the five appeals disposed of by the 'judgment, property sought to be added to the main "industrial heredita­ment" was not contiguous and was separated either by a public thoroughfare or a line of rail way or dwelling-house of other ownership or a canal and towing path. In treating the property as part of the main "industrial hereditament" the expression "contiguous to'' was interpreted meaning as "neighbouring" or "near to or neighbouring" or "in proximity to" excepting in one case where it was held "touching or in contest with". While commenting on the case <em><strong>Haynes Vs.  King</strong></em> the learned Chief Justice made the following observation:—<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"No person of education or intelligence would understand, or suspect, that a writer or speaker was using the word "contiguous in its loose sense of 'neighbouring' unless there was something in the context that compelled that conclusion. If a man spoke or wrote of 'contiguous islands' he must necessarily mean 'neighbouring' because one island must be separated by water from ano­ther. But if he spoke of 'contiguous houses' it would be difficult to suppose that he meant anything but houses touching each other".</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Mr. Ahmed referred to a decision in the case of <em><strong>Aziz Ahmed Vs. Nazir Ahmed I.L.R. 50 Allahabad 257</strong></em> to show that in spite of existence of a <em>kachcha</em> road over which the public had a right of passage, plaintiff's right of pre-emption as Shafi Khalit was allowed. This decision also does not help the respondents. Pre-emption was allowed to the plaintiff claiming to be a Shafi Khalit, because the plot although was divided into two portions by a <em>kachcha</em> public road, the plot, as a matter of fact, was one plot, there being no partition of the shares of the co-shar­ers, and the kachcha road was found to be part of the plot itself and was not a public property as in the instant case.<br/> <br/>14. In the context of the language of section 96 of the Act we have no doubt that the word 'contiguous' as occurring in the section means touching to the land transferred, and there is no scope for giving a different interpretation. A citizen's right to deal with his property freely, in view of the special sta­tutory provision, bears a clog, that is, subject to right of  pre-emption. The statutory provision providing such a right curtailing owner's right to deal with his property must be construed very strictly. The right is allowed to a claimant in consideration of his necessity and not as a matter of luxury. This principle should always be kept in view while deter­mining the claim of pre-emption. Clause (b) of sub-section (5) of section 96 sufficiently indicates the intention of the Legislature. We have already noted that in the instant case lands in five plots, namely, Plot Nos. 3347, 3387, 2535, 3385, and 3386 under five different khatians forming separate holdings, were transferred by a kabala in favour of the appellants. The respondents' prayer of pre­emption of the aforesaid lands on the ground of having land contiguous to the said land although intervened by a public pathway has been allowed on the view that contiguity was not severed by the public pathway. Even if the respondents' contention is accepted that conti­guity was not severed by the public pathway but that contiguity could not be stretched to make it the basis of claim of per-emption in respect of other plots. It is very often noticed that pre-emption under section 96 is allowed to a tenant having land contiguous to one of the several plots transferred, and pre-emption is allowed even in cases where the lands are not in a compact block, which is contrary to the provision of law itself.<br/> <br/>15. Every C.S. plot or R.S. plot or S.A. plot under the land laws, as depicted in the survey maps represent a separate entity, clearly identifiable in a holding recorded in a khatian. If more than one plot of land are transferred by a sale deed, a tenant having land contiguous to one of the plots, cannot lay his claim of pre-emption beyond that plot, because, the contiguity can not be stretched to other plots. This proposition would not only be in full agreement with the different provisions of section 96, but also in conformity with the very object of the legislation. Facts of the instant case provide an appropriate example. Lands in several plots forming five different holdings only touching to each other but not in a compact block have been made the subject-matter of the pre-emption case. Even if the pre-emptor's case that the pathway does not sever contiguity is accepted as correct, his claim for pre-emption can not be extended to the plots beyond schedule 1 land.<br/> <br/>16. The learned Judges of the High Court Division have taken on erroneous view that when the land of the pre-emptor and the land transferred is intervened by a pathway not belonging to an individual member of the public, contiguity is not lost, because, there is no interest to compete with that of the pre-emptor. According to the learned Judges, merely on account of a certain space recorded as public pathway in the name of the Gove­rnment, the contiguity between the purchased land and the pre-emptor's land is not severed. In other words, existence of a public pathway does not affect the right of pre-emption. In support of this view, neither any authority has been referred to nor any good reason has been given. It has been only stated that if the land intervening belongs to the Govern­ment, contiguity is not lost, because there is no competing interest to that of pre-emptor. This view seems to be absolutely wrong. Absence of any interest to compete with that of the pre-emptor does not change the meaning of the word "contiguous" used in sub-section (1) of section 95 of the Act and construed in its loose sense as ''neighbouring". In the context of the language of the legisla­tion the word "contiguous" employed therein, it can not have any other meaning than "to­uching". We have already noted above that the Legislature used the word '-contiguous" correctly and exactly, and not loosely and inexactly. The learned Counsel of the respon­dents also could not advance any context to support the view that the Legislature departed from the rule; and so that the loose and inexact meaning should be preferred. The view taken by the learned Judges of the High Court Division is also fallacious. If a small pathway belonging to the government, intervening be­tween the land of the pre-emptor and the land transferred is ignored on the reasoning given by the learned Judges in allowing pre-emption, is it possible on the same analogy to ignore a wide public road or a public highway intervening or the ground of absence of a compe­ting interest?<br/> <br/>In the facts and circumstances and the position in law explained above, the view taken by the High Court Division can not be approved. We have no doubt that the case under section 96 of the Act has not been correctly decided. In the result the appeal must succeed.<br/> <br/>Therefore, the appeal is allowed with costs. The judgment of the High Court Division and those of the Courts below are set aside and the application for pre-emption is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
