Abdul Matin J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 29.03.2006 passed in Civil Revision No. 3679 of 2000 by the High Court Division discharging the Rule and affirming those dated 05.07.2000 passed in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 304 of 1998 by the learned Additional District Judge, 4th Court, Chittagong affirming those dated 10.08.1988 passed by the learned Assistant Judge, Banskhali, Chittagong allowing the pre-emption.<br/> <br/>2. The facts, in short, are that the respon­dent Nos.1-4 as pre-emptors filed an application under Section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act and in the alternative under Section 24 of the Non-agricultural Tenancy Act against the peti­tioner and opposite party Nos. 21-22 pray­ing for pre-emption of the land of kabala dated 30.03.1986 alleging that the suit property originally belonged to Chandra Kumar, Banomali, Ramchandra and Raimohan and it was recorded as such in the R.S. record. Rai Mohan Saha sold his share in favour of Saber Ahmed by a kabala dated 24.05.1972 and then Saber Ahmed sold .03 acre of land from R.S. Plot No. 1685 in favour of Rashid Ahmed. Ramchandra died leaving 3 daughters Kiron Bala, Promila Bala and Nanibala. The son of Nanibala is Gouranga Prosad. Those sons of Kiron Bala and Promila Bala were opposite party Nos. 9-11 and 13-14 respectively. Gouranga son of Nanibala while she was alive on 24.10.1985 sold his expected share in favour of Surat Afzal Begum. Moniruzzaman purchased before hand the entire share of Nonibala on 24.12.1980. So, the pre-emptor became co-sharer in the holding. That pre-emptee Nos.1-2 on 07.02.1987 disclosed his pur­chase. The pre-emptor than obtained certi­fied copy and filed the case on 24.04.1987. So, the pre-emptors are enti­tled to pre-emption.<br/> <br/>3. The pre-emptees appeared in the case by filing a joint written objection stating that the pre-emptors are not at all co-shar­ers in the case holding inasmuch as they had taken kabala from Surat Afzal who had taken kabala on 24.10.1985 from Gourango and pre-emptors took kabala from Surat Afzal on 17.12.1985.  The mother of Gouranga Nanibala sold her entire share to Moniruzzaman on 24.12.1980. So, the pre-emptors acquired no title in the case land. The pre-emption is barred by limitation. The case is also barred by defect of parties inasmuch as Nanibala, Kiron Bala and Promila Bala (who are still living) are necessary parties. Hence the petition is liable to be rejected.<br/> <br/>4. Upon consideration of the pleading of the parties the trial court framed only one issue whether the pre-emptors are entitled to an order of pre-emption under Section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act.<br/> <br/>5. The case came up for final hearing before the trial court wherein the pre-emp­tors examined 2 P.Ws. and the pre-emptee only examined himself. The pre-emptors filed documents vide Ext. Nos.1-1(e) and the pre-emptee examined only himself as OPW-1 and exhibited a kabala dated 24.12.1980 Ext. A. The trial court was pleased to allow the pre-emption finding that (a) the case land is agricultural (nal) land; (b) the case of development has not been proved; and (c) kabala from limited interest holder and from reversioners made the pre-emptors owners and thus the pre-emptors are co-sharers and allowed the pre-emption.<br/> <br/>6. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judg­ment and order of the trial court the pre-emptee preferred Miscellaneous Appeal No.304 of 1988 before the learned District Judge, Chittagong and the said appeal was heard by the learned Additional  District  Judge,  4th  Court, Chittagong who was pleased to affirm the judgment and order of the trial court.<br/> <br/>7. Being aggrieved by the judgment and order of the Appellate Court the pre-emptee-petitioner obtained a Rule from the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.  3679 of 2000 and eventually the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division heard and discharged the Rule.<br/> <br/>8. Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment of the High Court Division the pre-emptee petitioner preferred the petition for leave to appeal.<br/> <br/>9. The learned Advocate for the pre-emptee-petitioner submits that the court below committed error of law in not con­sidering that the doctrine of propinquity of blood is the guiding principle for the law of inheritance under personal law. In the present case Nanibala is the daughter of the deceased last full owner and Nanibala sold her life interest in favour of Moniruzzaman by kabala dated 24.12.1980. Therefore by kabala dated 24.10.1985 from son of Nanibala Gourango vendee Surat Afzal Begum did not acquire any title and so by kabala dated 24.10.1985 the pre-emptors acquired no title. So, they are not co-shar­ers and hence have no locus standi to file the instant pre-emption case.<br/> <br/>10. It appears that all the courts below found that the pre-emptors are the co-sharers by purchase and the pre-emptee is a stranger and the pre-emption petition was filed within time after performing all for­malities and decided the prayer for pre­emption in favour of the respondent.<br/> <br/>11. It appears that the petitioner is ques­tioning the title of the seller in the land on the ground of violation of the doctrine of propinquity of blood in the matter of inheritance under the personal law but in a case of pre-emption this cannot be an issue and does not deserve to be decided here.<br/> <br/>We find no merit in this petition which is accordingly dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
