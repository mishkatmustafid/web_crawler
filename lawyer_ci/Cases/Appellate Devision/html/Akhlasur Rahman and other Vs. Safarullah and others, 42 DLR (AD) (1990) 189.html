Pre-emptor-respondent no.1 filed Misc. Case No. 37/80 in the 2nd Court of Munsif, Sadar, Sylhet for pre-emption of the case land transferred by respondents 2-4 to the appellants and another by a registered Kabala dated 10th Kartick 1383 B.S. corresponding to 27.10.76 for Tk. 6000/-, both as a co-sharer in the case holding and a contiguous owner to the case land. The appellants contested the Misc case, <em>inter alia</em>, on the ground that it was barred by estoppel, waiver and acquiescence as the pre-emptor himself assisted the vendors in selling the disputed land and encouraged the appellants to purchase the same.<br/> <br/>3. The learned Munsif by Judgment and order dated 16.5.81 held that the pre-emptor was co-sharer in the case holding, that the Misc case was not bad for defect of parties, that it was not barred by limitation but it was barred by estoppel, waiver and ac­quiescence. Accordingly, the Misc case was dis­missed. On appeal, the learned Additional Subordinate Judge, 1st Court, Sylhet, by judgment and order dated 1.9.82, affirmed the decision of the trial Court and dismissed the appeal.<br/> <br/>4. The pre-emptor then went in revision before the High Court Division. The learned Single Judge observed in the impugned judgment thus: —<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"The courts below came to the finding that the pre-emptor petitioner waived his right on the evidence adduced by the opposite parties as to the conduct of the pre-emptor petitioner at the time of negotiating the sale and execution of the kabala in question. It is now well settled that the right of pre-emptor accrues only on the reg­istration of the deed of transfer (kabala). The mere refusal to purchase or negotiate the con­tract of sale can not debar a pre-emptor from pre-empting after the transfer had become effective under law. The question of waiver of the right would arise only after the registration of the ka­bala. The right of pre-emption could be waived or relinquished by a specific agreement. In the instant case it is not alleged by the pre-emptee opposite parties that the pre-emptor petitioner had relinquished or waived his right of pre­emption by a special agreement."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>5. Having taken such view of the mailer, the Rule was made absolute and the pre-emption allowed by the impugned judgment and order.<br/> <br/>6. Leave was granted to consider whether the view taken by the learned judge of the High Court Division was correct in law and on facts found con­currently by the courts below.<br/> <br/>7. Mr. S.R. Pal, learned advocate for the appel­lants, submitted that the view taken by the learned judge that the question of waiver of the right of pre-emption would arise only after the registration of the kabala and further that the right could be waived or relinquished by a specific agreement was wrong on principle and authority. Mr. Pal argued that the right of pre-emption inheres in a co-sharer because of co-sharership in the land or holding and as such is amenable to be waived or relinquished by consent, conduct or acquiescence even before the sale actually lakes effect legally. Secondly, he submitted that the learned Judge having himself noticed that the courts below concurrently came to the finding that the pre-emptor had waived his right by conduct at the lime of negotiation for the sale, it ought to have been held that he was estopped from claiming pre-emption in any case cither by waiver or acquiescence or by both.<br/> <br/>8. Mr. Ranadhir Sen, learned advocate for the pre-emptor respondent, cautiously supported the view taken by the learned judge of the High Court Division contending that since it is settled law that the cause of action of pre-emption accrues only after the registration of the kabala there could not be any waiver of an imaginary right before the registration of the kabala as claimed in the present case. Mr. Sen, however, concedes that the principle of estoppel may operate in a particular case by reason of pre-emptors consent or acquiescence to the transaction even before the sale lakes effect but the facts of the present case are not sufficient to attract the said prin­ciple.<br/> <br/>9. Mr. Pal submits that section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act is a statutory recogni­tion of the right of pre-emption and provides for when and how the said right becomes enforceable but the right arises out of a relationship that exists between co-sharer tenants of a holding or land which confers a benefit on the one and obligation on the other. Tracing the background of the law of pre­emption the Privy Council has said in more cases than one that the law of pre-emption was introduced in undivided India by the Muhammadan (vide <em><strong>Digambar Singh Vs. Ahmed Said Khan 42 1A 10(18).</strong></em> As to the question whether the burden and benefit of a right of pre-emption are incidents annexed to the lands belonging respectively to the vendor and the pre-emptor or is the right merely one of re-purchase, which a neighbour or co-sharer enjoys under Mo­hammedan Law, and which he can enforce personally against the vendee in whom the title to the properly has already vested by sale, opinions varied in differ­ent High Courts of the then India. The Indian Su­preme Court in the case of <em><strong>Shi Audh Behari Singh Vs. Gajadhar Jaipura &amp; others (1955) ISCR 70 </strong></em>en­dorsed the view of <strong>Mahmood, J.</strong> of Allahabad High Court (<em><strong>7 All 775 Full Bench</strong></em>) saying that it is true that the right becomes enforceable only when there is a sale but the right exists antecedently to the sale, the foundation of the right being the avoidance of the inconveniences and disturbances which would arise from the introduction of a stranger into the land and that "we agree with Mr. Justice Mahmood that the sale is a condition precedent not to the existence of the right but to its enforceability." The Supreme Court further said that "the correct legal position seems to be that the law of Pre-emption imposes a limitation or disability upon the ownership of a property to the extent that it restricts the owner's un­fettered right of sale and compels him to sell the property to his co-sharer or neighbour as the case may be. The person who is a co-sharer in the land or owns lands in the vicinity consequently gets an ad­vantage or benefit corresponding to the burden with which the owner of the property is saddled, even though it does not amount to an actual interest in the properly sold. The crux of the whole thing is that the benefit as well as the burden of the right of pre-emption run with the land and can be enforced by or against the owner of the land for the time being although the right of the pre-emptor does not amount to an interest in the land itself."<br/> <br/>10. We are in respectful agreement with the principle enunciated above and hold further that the right can be waived or relinquished at an earlier date than on the dale of actual completion of the sale un­der the law or thereafter.<br/> <br/>11. In Halsbury's Laws of England, Third Edi­tion, Volume 14, page 637 it is stated that "Waiver is the abandonment of a right, and is either express or implied from conduct. A person who is entitled to the benefit of a stipulation in a contract or of a statu­tory provision may waive it, and allow the contract or transaction to proceed as though the stipulation or provision did not exist. Waiver of this kind depends upon consent and the fact that the other party has acted upon it is sufficient consideration. Where the waiver is not express, it may be implied from con­duct which is inconsistent with the continuance of the right. It seems that, in general, where one party has, by his words or conduct, made to the other a promise or assurance which was intended to affect the legal relations between them and to be acted on accordingly, then, once the other party has taken him at his word and acted on it, the party who gave the promise or assurance cannot afterwards be allowed to revert to the previous legal relationship as if no such promise or assurance had been made by him, but he must accept their legal relations subject to the quali­fication which he himself has so introduced, even though it is not supported in point of law by any consideration."<br/> <br/>12. In the same volume at page 638 it has been staled that "acquiescence" in its proper legal sense implies that a person abstains from interfering while a violation of his legal rights is in progress and further that "Acquiescence operates by way of estoppel. It is acquiescence in such circumstances that assent may reasonably be inferred, and is an instance of estoppel by words or conduct. Consequently, if the whole circumstances are proper for raising this estoppel, the party acquiescing cannot afterwards complain of the violation of his right".<br/> <br/>13. It is clear, therefore, that the facts proved in a particular case may give rise to waiver and ac­quiescence and a pre-emptor may be held to be estopped from enforcing his right of pre-emption. It is to be observed, however, that the statutory right will be denied to the pre-emptor only on proof of such combination of facts upon which a court of law can reasonably and validly make an inference of waiver and/or acquiescence. As no specific agreement is ne­cessary for raising such plea, it is equally important to remember that any and every act touching the transaction in which the pre-emptor may have taken part or the mere fact of knowledge about the transfer or temporary unwillingness on his pan to buy can­not debar him from claiming his right al the proper lime. Essentially, therefore, it will be a question of proper inference from the facts proved in each partic­ular case as to whether the plea of waiver and ac­quiescence exists validly or not.<br/> <br/>14. Mr. Pal has drawn our attention to a Sin­gle Bench decision of the High Court Division in the case of <em><strong>Maulana Abdul Karim Vs. Nurjahan Be­gum 38 DLR page 361</strong></em> where the courts below re­fused pre-emption, <em>inter alia</em>, on the ground of waiv­er because the pre-emptor was the guardian of the pre-emptee O.P. nos. 2-5 and he himself negotiated the sale under pre-emption. The learned Judge of the High Court Division (<strong>Mustafa Kamal, J</strong>) now a party to the present decision, upon making reference to several cases including one reported in <em><strong>22 DLR 449</strong></em> upheld the impugned decision observing that-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"when the pre-emptor is in <em>loco parentis</em> with the pre-emptees and negotiates the sale under pre-emption himself or the facts are such that his acquiescence in the sale can be safely concluded therefrom, the doctrine of estoppel comes into full play. The pre-emptor will be astopped from esserting his claim of pre­emption".</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>15. The facts of the said case provide a good example for invoking the principle of estoppel even though a view was expressed, which, however, has not much material bearing on the result, "that the case was not so much a case of waiver, but a case of acquiescence." Mr. Pal fell that it will be a pointless debate how to describe the emerging inference—a case of waiver or acquiescence—which is not free from difficulty, but the result nevertheless remains the same, that is, the principle of estoppel comes into play in both cases.<br/> <br/>16. Mr. Sen cautioned that for certain gratui­tous acts on the part of the pre-emptor an inference of waiver or estoppel should not be readily drawn. He referred to a passage from the judgment of <strong>Hamoodur Rahman, J.</strong> in the case of <em><strong>Ocean Industries Ltd. Vs. Industrial Development Bank 18 DLR (SC) 364</strong></em> which reads thus: —<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"To establish the case of waiver or estoppel it was necessary to clearly show that the party alleged to have waived its right had acted in such a manner as to lead the other side to believe that such rights will not be enforced or will be kept in suspense or abeyance for some particular time. The "gist of the equity", as observed by <strong>Viscount Simonds</strong> in the case of <em><strong>Tool Metal Co. Vs. Tungsten Electric Co.,</strong></em> "lies in the fact that one party has by his conduct led the other to alter his position," yet he cautioned that he would not have it supposed that in commercial transactions "mere acts of indulgence are apt to create rights". A mere gratuitous indulgence shown by not enforcing strictly one's legal rights for a brief period cannot, in our view, give rise to the inference that the rights have been abandoned for all times."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>17. The observations made in respect of a commercial transaction may not be wholly apt in the facts of a pre-emption case but the general principle which attracts equity, it is not disputed, must be present in all cases, that is, the facts must show that one party has by his conduct led the other to alter his position.<br/> <br/>18. Let us then see the facts proved and found concurrently in the present case in the light of the principles discussed above.<br/> <br/>19. The trial Court in its judgment found as to issue No. 4 thus:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"It is the specific case of the objecting O.Ps. in para 10(ga) of the written objection that the earlier O.Ps. No. 5-7(sellers) out of ne­cessity of fund made frantic attempt to sell the case land at maximum price within the knowl­edge of all and the ptr. being a neighbour of the seller of O.Ps. 5-7 assisted them in selling the same and also encouraged the O.Ps. No.1-4 to purchase the case land. It is also definite case of the objecting O.Ps. that the ptr. played active part in negotiating the transaction having partic­ipated in the talk of sale. The objecting O.Ps led evidence at the time of trial to the effect that the ptr. knew about the sale of the case land and he actively took part in settling the transaction.....on scrutiny it appears that the OPW 1 fully sup­ported the written objection case while the OPW 3 corroborated the OPW 1. On the above obser­vation it appears that the misc. case is barred by estoppel, waiver and acquiescence."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>20. It is clear that the pre-emptor took a lead­ing part in bringing about the transaction; he assist­ed the sellers in selling the land, encouraged the buy­ers to purchase it and himself negotiated the price. In our opinion, this conduct of the pre-emptor was rea­sonably sufficient to give rise to waiver and acquies­cence, and thus estoppel will operate in any case be­cause the conduct of the pre-emptor has induced the purchasers (appellants) to alter their position and the pre-emptor cannot now turn round and assert his right to undo a transaction which is very largely the result of his own creation. We, therefore, find that there is good deal of substance in the contentions raised by Mr. Pal and the view taken by the learned Judge of The High Court Division cannot be legally sustained.<br/> <br/>21. In the result, therefore, the appeal is al­lowed and the impugned judgment set aside. No cost.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
