The trial Court decreed the suit. The High Court Division re­versing the same dismissed the suit against defendant No.1 and decreed it for Tk. 40,000/- against defendant No.2.<br/> <br/>5. The appellant's suit for specific performance of contract was founded upon the allegations, <em>inter alia</em>, that defendant No.1 (since deceased and substi­tuted by her heirs), a respectable old Muslim lady, then almost invalid and living in the same mess with her sons, expressed her desire to sell the suit land and structures in her ownership situated at Chittagong through her son and karyakarak, defendant No.2 who was a chartered accountant by profession. On 1.9.73 the appellant along with a friend PW 2, Abul Hassan met defendant No. 1 at the residence of her son defendant No. 2 at Gulshan, Dhaka where in presence of defendant No.2, PW 2 and the appellant defendant No. 1 offered to sell the suit land to the ap­pellant who accepted the said offer. At the same sit­ting the price was fixed at Tk. 2,50,000/-. The ap­pellant made a payment of Tk. 10,000/- in cash by way of earnest money. Defendant No. 1, by way of accepting the said amount, asked her son defendant No. 2 to grant a receipt for the same as she was phys­ically infirm. Accordingly, defendant No.2 granted a receipt for Tk. 10,000/- for and on behalf of defen­dant No.1 who promised to execute the final deed of conveyance within three months on receipt of the balance consideration money after obtaining in­come-tax clearance certificate and on payment of cap­ital gains tax, etc. Defendant No. 2 on behalf of de­fendant No. 1 also handed over a sheet of plain paper containing the Khatian and plot numbers of the suit land to enable the appellant to make an enquiry if he so likes. Defendant No. 2 also assured the appellant that he would send all the connected documents to the appellant within a day or two for preparation of the deed of conveyance. The appellant returned to Chittagong and waited in vain for the connected doc­uments and ultimately instructed his Advocate Mr. Md. Nurul Huda to send a registered letter to defen­dant No. 2 which he did on 17.11.73 requesting him to complete the transaction. Defendant No. 2 by a registered letter dated 22.11.73 regretted his inability to do the same claiming the receipt of money did not involve his mother and that the suit land would be required for accommodating his sister and her hus­band on being posted back to Chittagong by Janata Bank following repatriation from Pakistan. Defen­dant No. 2 offered to return the earnest money of Tk. 10,000/-. The appellant alleged that defendant No. 2 has since tried to sell the suit land at a higher price by engaging brokers and by contacting interested purchasers willing to pay a higher price than the ap­pellant's. Hence the suit.<br/> <br/>6. Defendant Nos.1 and 2 filed separate written statements and contested the suit. It is the contention of defendant No.1 that there is no cause of action against the said defendant. Both the defendants stated that defendant No.2 was not the agent or karyakarak of defendant No.1. Both of them denied the entire story of the offer of defendant No.1 to sell the suit land to the appellant through her son, the alleged ne­gotiations and settlement of price on 1.9.73 at Gulshan, acceptance of Tk. 10,000/- as earnest money in pursuance thereof, grant of receipt by defendant No. 2 on behalf of defendant No.1 and the other stories. Defendant No. 1 staled that she never contracted to sell the suit land to the appellant. She stated that she was not bound by any action of defendant No.2 who was not her agent or karyakarak.<br/> <br/>7. Defendant No. 2 admitted that he received the letter dated 17.11.73 sent by Mr. Md. Nurul Huda, Advocate but he stated that by his registered reply dated 22.11.73 he clearly staled that there was noth­ing anywhere in any manner as to the involvement of defendant No.1 in the mailer of agreeing to sell her properly or to take earnest money. He suited that the appellant approached him on a number of occa­sions and then prevailed upon him to sell his mother’s property and left Tk. 10,000/- forcibly in his of­fice. He had to issue a receipt reluctantly, but all these were done without the knowledge and consent of defendant No.1. This defendant honestly kepi the money for which defendant No.1 has no responsibili­ty or liability. He has also offered to return the mon­ey. The appellant was appraised fully about the outcome but he has filed the suit out of greed.<br/> <br/>8. Several issues were framed by the trial Court. The plaintiff-appellant examined 4 witnesses and the defendant-respondents examined 2 witnesses. Several documents were admitted into evidence on behalf of the appellant.<br/> <br/>9. The trial Court laid stress on Ext. 4, the re­ceipt and believed the story of the appellant, corrobo­rated by PW 2. It concluded that defendant No.1 was present al the time of talk al Gulshan on 1-9-73. Ext.1, a typed sheet of paper containing particulars of the suit properties, not denied by defendant No.2, but admitted by him to have been signed by a partner of his firm, supports the final talk between the par­ties. That defendant No.2 acted as the agent and kar­yakarak of defendant No.1 is borne out by Exts. 2 and 7 series showing payment of municipal taxes, etc. by defendant No.2 in respect of the suit properties and also Ext. 3 series showing issuance of cheques by defendant No.2 for payment of the same, on behalf of defendant No.1. PW 3 also corroborates Exts. 2, 3 and 7 series. Defendant No.1, deposing as DW 1 keeps little knowledge and information about the suit properties. This shows that somebody else manages the suit properties on her behalf. Ext. 4 contains the particulars of suit properties, total consideration, and amount of earnest money. From the nature of Ext. 4 it is clear that if defendant No.1 was not there in the talks, then the price could not have been fixed at Tk. 2,50,000/-. Tk. 10,000/- was spe­cifically mentioned in Ext. 4 as earnest money. This shows that the negotiations and contract were com­pleted. Although Ext.4 and other papers do not contain any signature of defendant No. 1, yet Ext.4 along with the evidence of PWs 1 and 2 clearly proves that the terms of the contract were settled and part pay­ment was made in presence of defendant No.1, the real owner. PW 4 proved that the defendants were trying to sell the suit properties at a higher price even after receipt of Tk. 10,000/- from the appellant. Both the defendants were represented by the same Advocate, hence they are on good terms and not op­posed to each other. Defendant No. 1 was backing out of her promise by laying the blame on her son. The suit was decreed.<br/> <br/>10. The High Court Division considered the question as to why Ext. 4 does not contain any signature of defendant No. 1 and was not satisfied with the explanation of the appellant as PW 1 that she was old, invalid and unable to write. The High Court Division noticed that deposing on commission defendant No. 1 signed her deposition. Had she been present at the time of granting receipt Ext.4, her signature would appear there. There is nothing in the contents of Ext. 4 that it was being written al the di­rection of defendant No.1 or that she was present and had knowledge and consent in the matter or that she had accepted any money. The appellant’s Advocate did not address any letter to defendant No.1, PW 2 is a subsequently procured winless to depose falsely to support the plaintiffs story as he neither signed the receipt Ext. 4 as a witness nor has he been referred lo in the letter Ext. 6 written by the plaintiffs Advo­cate lo defendant No.2 on 17.11.73. The defendant No.2 clearly denied that his mother was involved in the issuance of Ext. 4 or in any negotiations and contract of sale by his reply dated 22.11.73, Ext. 6 (a) and that he had no authority to sell the properties. The High Court Division placed no reliance on the story given out by PWs 1 and 2 that there was an oral agreement on 1.9.73 at the Gulshan house of defendant No.2. The receipt Ext. 4 does not bind the defendant No.1. Consequently her substituted heirs are also not bound by it. The appellant is, therefore, not entitled to get a decree for specific performance of contract. Defendant No.2, however, irresponsibly retained Tk. 10,000/- from the appellant who is enti­tled to get a compensation which the High Court Di­vision assessed at Tk.30,000/-. It allowed the appeal, dismissed the suit against defendant No.1 and decreed it against defendant No.2, for a sum of Tk. 40,000/-.<br/> <br/>11. The appellant has obtained leave from the said judgment and decree of the High Court Divi­sion. Leave was granted to consider- (a) if the High Court Division had misread the evidence in coming to the conclusion that there was no concluded con­tract; (b) if defendant No.2, was, in fact, acting on behalf of his mother as agent and karyakarak; and (c) if the substituted heirs of deceased defendant No.1 are bound by the contract.<br/> <br/>12. Mr. Khandker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, learned Counsel for the plaintiff-appellant, submits that the High Court Division erred in law in deduc­ing absence of defendant No.1 from the talks on 1-9-73. It is no good reason to say that had she been present she would have signed Ext.4 because she may have been weak and infirm in 1973 but she may have recovered sufficiently in 1976 to be able to put her signature in the deposition sheet. No reason has been given by the High Court Division as to why the evidence of PWs 1 and 2 should be discarded, be­yond stating that no reliance can be put on the story given out by them. The High Court Division has failed to consider that when the appellant has pro­duced from his custody a receipt Ext. 4 admittedly signed by defendant No.2, the defendants had the onus to prove their alternative story as to how the receipt came into existence. Defendant No.2 has not produced any evidence that the appellant prevailed upon him to sell his mother's properties and left Tk.10,000/- forcibly in his office. It was only his as­sertion, unsupported by any corroborative evidence. Defendant No.1 as DW 1 stated in her cross-examination that on 6/7th September, 1973 the ap­pellant went to her eldest son's house when she told him that she would not sell the suit properties, but this story is not contained in her written statement. Defendant No.2 as DW 2 stated in his examination-in-chief that between 1.9.73 and 17.11.73 he met the appellant only once in the house of his eldest brother at Eskaton Gardens. He told the appellant to take back Tk.10,000/- and return the receipt. All these statements are not contained in the written statement of defendant No.2. There is also no corroborative ev­idence in support thereof. The High Court Division has further failed to consider that the defendant No.2 did not offer to return the earnest money to the ap­pellant at the earliest available opportunity, but did so nearly 12 weeks after 1.9.73, and that also after receipt of the appellant's legal notice. The trial Court, he submits, has duly considered the attendant circumstances surrounding Ext.4, as also the special features of Ext.4, but the High Court Division com­pletely failed to reverse those observations of the trial Court, he submits. Mr. Khandker Mahbubuddin Ahmed further submits that PW 3, Tahsilder has proved Exts. 2, 3 and 7 series, but the High Court Division has ignored his evidence and the Exts. which he proved. The High Court Division has not considered the appellant's evidence in support of his contention that defendant No.2 was the agent and karyakarak of defendant No.1. Finally, Mr. Ahmed submits, there has been a total non-consideration of the evidence of PW 4, an intending buyer and an in­dependent witness, who deposed that the defendants were trying to sell the suit properties at a higher price after 1.9.73. There has also been no considera­tion of Ext 1.<br/> <br/>13. Central to the issue is the question as to whether the appellant had a contract with defendant No. 1 on 1.9.73 at the Gulshan house of defendant No.2 to sell the suit properties at Chittagong or whether he had negotiations only with defendant No.2 without the knowledge and consent of defen­dant No. 1. The further question is, whether defendant No.2 acted as the agent and karyakarak of defendant No.1 in the matter of sale of the properties of the latter and whether the receipt Ext. 4 was granted by defendant No.2 for and on behalf of defendant No. 1 or solely on his own authority without the knowl­edge and consent of defendant No. 1.<br/> <br/>14. It is not difficult to see that Mr. Ahmed has based his argument not so much upon misread­ing of evidence, but on a wider canvass of omission to consider material evidence on record and failure to deduce legal inference from facts proved.<br/> <br/>15. There is no written agreement of sale. The appellant has come out with a story of an oral agree­ment of sale on 1.9.73 but the oral evidence of PWs. 1 and 2, on the one hand, in support of the same and those of DWs 1 and 2, on the other hand denying the same are mutually contradictory. The receipt Ext. 4 is the main documentary evidence furnished by the appellant in support of his case. The trial Court, as already stated, noticed the special features of the re­ceipt and in conjunction with the other evidence on record deduced the presence of oral agreement be­tween the appellant and defendant No. 1. The High Court Division noticed the opposite special features of the same document. Thus it noticed that Ext. 4 contained no signature of defendant No. 1. Hence her presence in the talks was doubted. It found the expla­nation of the appellant to be unacceptable. The reason given for non-acceptance may be explained away by giving counter-reason, but an alternative argument countering the reason given by the first appel­late Court is hardly a commendable ground for inter­ference with a finding of fact. The High Court Division also found that Ext.4 did not contain the signature of PW 2. Hence his presence in the talks was also doubted. The High Court Division further found that there was no recital in Ext.4 that it was prepared at the direction of defendant No.1 or that de­fendant No.2 was signing the same on behalf of de­fendant No. 1.<br/> <br/>16. It cannot be said that the High Court Divi­sion had no jurisdiction to notice these contradictory features in Ext. 4, nor can it be said that the features noticed are of no significance. The High Court Divi­sion was fully entitled to draw any reasonable infer­ence from these features and it cannot be said that the inference drawn therefrom are unreasonable, perverse or shocking to conscience. It will no be correct to say that no reason has been given for discarding the evidence of PWs 1 and 2. Reasons have been given and those are not such as to warrant an interference.<br/> <br/>17. With regard to the defendants' <em>onus probandi</em>, we find that the defendants have no onus of proof in the facts and circumstances of the case. When the plaintiff produces from his custody an agreement for sale signed by the defendant who admitting the sig­nature gives out an alternative story as to how he put his signature in the document, onus lies on the defendant to prove his part of the story. In the present case the plaintiff has produced not an agree­ment of sale but a receipt of earnest money, signed not by the owner of the suit properties but by her son. The basis of his suit is an oral agreement, not Ext. 4 which is only a supporting evidence. The de­fendants have no burden to prove their alternative story with regard to the creation of Ext.4.<br/> <br/>18. The High Court Division no doubt did not consider Exts. 2, 3 and 7 series and the evidence of P.W. 3, but the evidence so left out of consideration merely establishes an authority to manage the suit properties. Mr. Ahmed, in fact, conceded that an au­thority to sell does not stand at par with an authority to manage the properties. There is absolutely no evi­dence that defendant No.2 acted as the agent and karyakarak of defendant No. 1 in respect of sale of the suit properties. Such evidence was absolutely neces­sary in view of the fact that defendant No.1 had 4 other sons and 4 daughters. Consequently Ext.4, granted by defendant No.2 on his own authority does not bind defendant No.l or her heirs and successors.<br/> <br/>19. If it is believed that a contract to sell the suit properties was concluded on 1.9.73 then the offer of defendant No.2 to return the earnest money about 12 weeks after 1.9.73 is a belated attempt to wriggle out of a commitment, as Mr. Ahmed sub­mits. But if such a contract is not established at all, as the High Court Division has found, the lapse of 12 weeks from granting Ext. 4 the receipt, has no significance.<br/> <br/>20. Same with the deposition of PW4. His ev­idence assumes importance only if the contract is be­lieved. With the contract remaining unproved his ev­idence means nothing. Ext.1, the plain paper containing the particulars of the suit properties and signed by a partner of the firm of defendant No.2 shows, contrary to the finding of the trial Court, that it was obtained from the Chittagong office of the firm of defendant No.2, as there is evidence on record that the partner in question used to look after the firm's business at Chittagong at the relevant time.<br/> <br/>21. Hence on all points raised the appeal docs not merit any interference. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed. No costs.<br/> <br/><strong><u>Latifur Rahman J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This appeal by the plaintiff is directed against the judgment and decree passed by the High Court Division, Chittagong, Bench, Chittagong in First Appeal No.46 of 1977 reversing the judgment and decree passed by the Sub­ordinate Judge, Chittagong in Other Suit No.83 of 1973 arising out of a suit for specific performance of contract.<br/> <br/>23. The plaintiffs case, is that, the suit prop­erties mentioned in the schedule of the plaint be­longed to defendant No.1 Mst. Zohura Khatoon, de­fendant No.2, Mr. Rezaur Rahman is the son and karjya karak of defendant No. 1 who is a very respect­able and old Muslim lady presently almost invalid. She has been living with defendant No.2 at his Gulshan House, Dhaka for a long time. Defendant No.1 wanted to sell the suit land along with the structures thereon through her son defendant No.2 and the plaintiff wanted to purchase the same. On 1.9.73 the plaintiff along with his friend PW 2 Abul Hassan went to the house of defendant No.2 at 10 Gulshan, Dhaka to meet defendant No.1 and to finalise the talk of sale and to make necessary advance if possible. On that date the final talk was held at the residence of defendant No.2 in presence of defendant No.1, the owner of the suit property and finally price was fixed after negotiation at Tk. 2,50,000/-. In the same sitting the plaintiff paid an advance of Tk. 10,000/-as part payment of the consideration amount to defendant No.1 who being an old lady, the receipt was granted by her son defendant No.2 at the direction of defen­dant No.1. On the same day defendant No.2 also gave a typed paper to the plaintiff containing particu­lars of the land agreed to be sold. Defendant No.1 on receipt of the earnest money promised to execute the final deed of transfer within 3 months on receipt of the balance consideration money and after obtaining necessary income tax and other certificates. Defen­dant No.2 also promised to send all connected docu­ments to the plaintiff for preparation of the deed of transfer within a short time. But the defendants hav­ing not taken any step in this regard the plaintiff sent a registered letter through his Advocate on 17.11.73 requesting defendant No.1 to complete the transaction. Defendant No.2 in reply to the Advo­cate's notice replied on 22.11.73 expressing his ina­bility to sell the suit land to the plaintiff as the re­ceipt of money does not involve his mother and the schedule property will be required by them for ac­commodating his sister and her husband who is to be posted back to Chittagong. Defendant No.2 ex­pressed his willingness to return the earnest money of Taka 10,000/- paid by the plaintiff. The plaintiff in the meanwhile came to know that defendant No.1 is negotiating with other parties to sell the suit land at a higher price as the price of land increased in the meantime. Finding no other alternative, the plaintiff filed this suit for specific performance of contract against defendant No.1 for the suit land.<br/> <br/>24. Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 filed two separate written statements and contested the suit. The con­tentions of both the defendants are that there was no agreement of sale between the plaintiff and defendant No.1 regarding the sale of the suit land. Defendant No.1 totally denied the agreement of sale as a false, fabricated and concocted one. Their further case is that, the plaintiff approached defendant No.2 at his Chittagong Office for purchase of the suit land and requested the defendant to prevail upon his mother to sell the properties to plaintiff and the plaintiff left Tk. 10,000/- forcibly in the office of this defendant who had to issue a receipt for this amount reluctant­ly and all these were done without the knowledge and consent of defendant No.1 otherwise the receipt would have been signed by his mother. It has further been contended that defendant No.1 is not willing to sell the properties as one of her daughters recently re­turned from Karachi who was to live at Chittagong with her husband. Defendant No.2 is willing to re­turn the money to the plaintiff with interest but the plaintiff is not agreeable to that. The defendants completely denied any talk or negotiation with the plaintiff and defendant No.1 at their Gulshan resi­dence, Dhaka. The owner of the property namely, the mother of defendant No.2 is not a party to the al­leged contract or talk of sale. Defendant No.2 further asserted that he is not an agent and karjyakarak of his mother and this defendant honestly kept the money for which defendant. No.1 had no responsibility in the matter and the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/>25. In this appeal leave was granted on two points namely: (1) that the High Court Division had misread the evidence in coming to the conclusion that there was no concluded contract; (2) defendant No.2 was in fact, acting on behalf of his mother as agent and Karjya Karak in the contract for sale. At the outset I must say that the above two points on which leave was granted by this court was not ad­verted to by the first appellate Court and as such the judgment and decree must be set aside.<br/> <br/>26. The trial Judge on consideration of the en­tire evidences on record particularly on construction of Ext.4, the money receipt came to positive find­ings that the negotiation and contract for sale of the land was a concluded contract and that defendants 1 and 2 are in good terms and not opposed to each oth­er, but in order to resist the claim of the plaintiff, de­fendant No.1 tried to shake off her responsibility in this contract by putting all the blame on her son and consequently decreed the suit.<br/> <br/>27. The High Court Division as the first court of appeal dismissed the suit primarily on the ground that had she been present at the time of granting re­ceipt Ext. 4 dated 1.7.73, her signature would appear in Ext. 4 in normal course and that there is absolute­ly nothing in the contents of Ext.4 at all to show that it was being written according to the direction of defendant No.1. The High Court Division while dis­missing the suit also awarded a compensation of Tk. 30,000/- against defendant No.2 for keeping the money for such a long time as deposit against the said property although he was not the owner of the property.<br/> <br/>28. It is needless to say that this court normal­ly does not interfere into questions of fact arrived at by the Appellate Court on consideration of the evi­dence on record. But the present case, to my mind, is not merely one of findings of fact as because in this case the plaintiff primarily based his contract for pur­chase on a very vital document namely, exhibit 4, the money receipt and the High Court Division as first appellate Court was called upon to decide the contract for sale on construction of Ext. 4. Since the legal effect of the document as contained in the word­ings of the document itself has not been determined, I have no option but to interfere with the judgment of the lower appellate Court as the same is not in ac­cordance with law. If the question would have been purely one of believing the document of contract and other evidences on record, then of course, I would not have ventured to determine the issue by holding it as one of pure question of law. The broad and es­sential approach in such a case of contract would be to construe the effect of the document Ext.4 and Ext.1 list of schedule of properties, apart from the other controversies as raised at the trial. Unless the present case is approached from that angle, surely one will commit mistake not only in fact but also in law. The effect of recitals in Ext.4 remains on the document, the parties adduced oral evidences to ascertain the true intention of the document by adducing surrounding facts and circumstances at the trial, but the essential question that remains to be determined is the effect of the document itself and the High Court Division misdirected in law in this regard.<br/> <br/>29. In this case the plaintiff has filed some documents and adduced 4 witnesses to prove the con­tract and, on the contrary, the defendants examined two witnesses, namely, the mother, defendant No.1 and the son, defendant No.2. Hereinbelow, I will dis­cuss the material evidence on record for proper under­standing and appreciation of the case. Plaintiff in support of his case has filed exhibit 4, the "money re­ceipt and exhibit 1, the list of schedule of properties proposed to be sold.<br/> <br/>The money receipt Ext.4 reads as fol­lows: —<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Received the sum of Taka ten thousand only as deposit against the sale proceed of Nandan Kanan Properties at first lane, Nandan Kanan Plot Nos.21, 22,23, 24 and 25 at a total sum of Taka Two lac and fifty thousand only".<br/>Sd/-R.Rahman<br/>1.9.73".</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Thus, this receipt speaks of receiving an amount of Tk. 10,000/- in respect of properly mentioned therein and the total consideration of which was fixed at Tk. 2,50,000/- only. This receipt was admittedly written and signed by the son of defendant No.1, who is defendant No.2 in the case. Whether this re­ceipt was written at the direction of defendant No. 1 in her presence after receiving the earnest money, whether the mother being a very old lady could not sign her name herself, or whether the plaintiff in good faith accepted the money receipt as acceptance of part payment of consideration money for the con­tract for sale of the land are matters for which the parties adduced oral evidence at The trial and the same will be discussed and considered in appropriate place. Along with Ext. 4, the plaintiff has produced Ext.1, list of schedule of property given to the plaintiff on the same day of execution of Ext.4, on the same sit­ting by defendant No.2, so that the plaintiff could make searches in the relevant office to see whether the property in question is free from encumbrances.<br/> <br/>30. Before going into the oral evidence, I will presently divide the documents of the plaintiff as filed in this case in three categories. In the first cate­gory I will take up exhibit 4, the money receipt and exhibit 1, the list of schedule of property. In the sec­ond group I will take up exhibit 2 series, exhibit 3 series and exhibit 7 series showing that the son was in fact dealing with and paying all taxes and rents in respect of the said property on behalf of his old mother and in the third group, I will take up exhibit 6, the lawyers' notice dated 17.11.73 as sent by the plaintiff and the reply of defendant No.2 exhibit 6(a) dated 22.11.73.<br/> <br/>31. In Exhibit 4 as indicated above, the trial Court found to be a receipt of money by fixing the total consideration price of the property giving the particulars of the property to be sold and acceptance of the part payment of the consideration money. Ex­hibit (1-5) is the schedule of properties of defendant No. 1. In order to show that the defendant No.2, the second son of the defendant No.1, was in fact dealing with the property as agent and karjakarak of his mother, exhibits 2, 2(a)-2(g) were filed showing Mu­nicipal tax receipts. Exhibit 3 series are the photocopies of the cheques issued by defendant No.2 from his Firm towards the payment of the Municipal tax­es of the said property. Exhibit 7 series are rent re­ceipts paid in respect, of the said land of defendant No.1 by his son defendant No.2.<br/> <br/>32. Along with these documents as filed in the case by the plaintiff, I will discuss and consider the oral evidence on record to see whether the learned Judges of the High Court Division misdirected in law and fell into a serious error of law in deciding the vital question involved in the case.<br/> <br/>33. PW 1 is the plaintiff himself who deposed that on 1.9.73 defendant No.2 wrote exhibit 4 and signed the same in presence of the plaintiff and the earnest money of Taka 10,000/- was accepted by de­fendant No.1 as advance after fixing the total consid­eration price of the property at Tk. 2,50,000/-. He fur­ther deposed that on the same day schedule of property Exhibit-1, containing details of the property was handed over to him. Defendant No.1 on receipt of the earnest money promised to execute the kabala within three months on receipt of the balance mon­ey. He further slated that defendant No. 1 being inval­id on her request defendant No.2 granted the receipt and at the transaction the plaintiff; PW 2 and both the defendants were present at 10 Gulshan House of defendant No.2. In cross-examination he admitted that defendant No.2 is the partner of the Firm Rah­man and Huq and that Chartered Accountant Aminul Huq and one Abu Taher, a staff of defendant No.2 at his Chittagong Office first informed them about this offer for sale. In cross-examination he stated that he did not cite Abu Taher as he is an employee of de­fendant No.2. He categorically denied the suggestion of the defendants that the money was paid in the of­fice of defendant No.1 at Chittagong. He further stat­ed that after payment of the earnest money defendant No.2 wrote the receipt at the direction of defendant No.1. PW 2 Abul Hassan is a businessman of Chit­tagong and he accompanied the plaintiff to the house of defendant No.2 on 1.9.73. He deposed that defen­dant Nos.1 and 2 at first demanded three lac taka as price and ultimately the price was settled at Taka 2,50,000/- for the suit land. The defendants agreed to sell the land and the money was accepted by defen­dant No. 1 and her son, defendant No.2, granted the receipt to plaintiff which was written in presence of the mother. He also stated that defendant No. 1 was too old and sick and as such she could not write or sign the receipt. He also stated that at the time of contract this exhibit (1-5), the list of schedule of properties was given to the plaintiff in presence of defendant No.1. In cross-examination this witness stated that he deals in medicine business and knows the plaintiff for the last four years. According to this witness, exhibit 4 was written by the defendant No.2 as defendant No.1 stated that she could not sign as her hand trembled and defendant No.2 was her Karjakarak. PW 3 Abul Kashem is the Assistant Tahsildar of Sadar Tahsil Office and proved exhibit 7 ser­ies, the rent receipt books, showing that all rents were paid by defendant No.2 Rezaur Rahman in re­spect of the schedule property of defendant No.1. In cross-examination he admitted that he knows Mr. Rezaur Rahman who personally came to their office and paid rents in respect of property of Zohura Khatoon (defendant No.1), the recorded tenant. PW 4 Nurul Islam, an Assistant Branch Manager of Jiban Bima Corporation of Agrabad, Chittagong, deposed that he wanted to purchase the same land in October, 1973 and he had a talk with defendant No.2 and he demanded 4 lacs as its price in October, 1973. He further stated that he went to inspect the suit land in the end of October, 1973 when he met the plaintiff and learnt from him that he had already contracted to purchase the suit land at Tk. 2,50,000/- so he did not proceed in the matter. In cross-examination he admit­ted that defendant No.2 also told him that the proper­ty belonged to his mother. He further stated that he wanted to purchase the land jointly with one Dr. Rezia Begum Choudhury who also went with him to see the land. He denied the suggestion of defendants that he was deposing falsely. This witness also stat­ed that he asked Abu Taher subsequently about the matter. This is all the material oral evidence on record of the plaintiff.<br/> <br/>34. DW 1 Zohura Khatun, mother of defendant No.2, deposed on commission that on 1.9.73, the plaintiff did not come to her house nor there was any talk of sale of the property with him. She admitted that her son, defendant No.2, is a Chartered Accoun­tant. She stated that defendant No.2 was not her karjakarak. She, of course, admitted that her health broke down during the war of liberation and gradual­ly the same deteriorated. In cross-examination, of course, she admitted that on 6th or 7th in the month of September, 1973, she told the plaintiff that she would not sell the property. She further denied the defence suggestion that in order to get more price for the land she refused to sell the land to the plaintiff after entering into an agreement. DW 2 Rezaur Rah­man, defendant No.2, is the second son of defendant No.1 who totally denied about the contract of sale. He totally denied that he accepted Tk. 10,000/- after fixing Tk. 2,50,000/- as the total consideration price of the schedule property. Of course, he admitted that he accepted Tk. 10,000/- on 1.9.73 by saying to the plaintiff that he accepted the money on condition that he would get the consent of his mother as to whether she would sell the property and kept the money. He, of course, stated in cross-examination that he met the plaintiff once between 1.9.73 to 17.11.73 in the house of his brother at Eskaton which took place within a week from 1.9.73. He fur­ther stated that he requested the plaintiff to return the receipt by taking back Tk. 10,000/-. He admitted that Aminul Huq was a resident partner of his firm till 1975. He admitted that exhibit 4 was written and signed by him and granted on 1.9.73. He further ad­mitted that he did not disclose to anybody that by force the plaintiff kept the money with this defen­dant. While deposing he stated that his mother is aged about 75 years. This is all the oral evidence ad­duced by the defendants in the case.<br/> <br/>35. The trial Court as the first court of fact found that Exhibit 4, the most vital document in fa­vour of the plaintiff, shows acceptance of part pay­ment of consideration money in respect of the suit land granted by the son of defendant No.1. Along with it, the trial Judge considered Exhibit 1, the list of schedule of property, and came to a positive find­ing that the contract was a concluded one between the parties by holding as follows: —</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"Ext.4 the receipt given by the defdt. 2 in favour of the plaintiff shows that a sum of Taka 10,000/- only was received by the defdt. on 1.9.73 as sale proceed of Nandan Kanan Proper­ties at first lane. Plots No.21, 22, 23, 24 &amp; 25 are also mentioned in this receipt. It is also clear from the receipt that the price was settled at Taka 2,50,000/- only. From the nature of the re­ceipt Ext.4. It appears that the advance of Tk. 10,000/- was received by defdt. No. 2 with full authority from defdt. No.1 and it can safely be presumed that he being an educated and re­sponsible Chartered Accountant certainly consid­ered this deposit against the sale proceed. If de­fendant No.1 was not there then how could the price of the properties be fixed at Taka 2,50,000/-? This shows that the negotiation and contract was completed. The typed paper (Ext.1) containing the schedule of the properties was also filed by the plaintiff which was admittedly signed by a partner of defendant No.2's Firm. This also supports the final talk between parties."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>36. The trial Court also considered the entire oral and documentary evidences namely, exhibit 2 series, 3 series, 7 series and other surrounding facts and circumstances and came to a positive finding that the defendant No.2 acted as agent and karjakarak of his mother in the sale transaction and wrote the re­ceipt Ext.4 at the direction and with the full knowl­edge of the matter. The finding of the trial Court in this regard may be quoted as follows:—<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"All the above facts, circumstances and evi­dence go conclusively to prove that defdt. No.1 contracted to sell the suit properties to the plain­tiff on 1.9.73 through her son and caretaker Mr. Rezaur Rahman, defdt. No.2 at Tk. 2,50,000/- out of which defendants 1 and 2 received Taka 10,000/- as advance. If the defence case was real­ly true that the mother was not agreeable to sell the properties it was the duty of the defdt. No.2 at once to inform the plaintiff about the same and refund the amount received by him earlier. But there is nothing in evidence to show that defdt. 2 really made any such attempt within 2-1/2 months till the receipt of the plff’s advo­cate's letter by defdt. No. 2 (Ext. 6). It was only on 22.11.73 that defendant No.2 agreed to refund the money to the plaintiff. But plaintiff insisted to enforce the contract and filed the present suit soon after on payment of court fees on Taka 2,50,000/-."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>37. These two material findings quoted above unmistakably show that proper and legal findings were arrived at by the trial Court. In view of the pos­itive findings as already indicated above, the appel­late Court was under a legal obligation to set aside those positive findings but the appellate Court did not in fact do so. Further, the High Court Division misdirected itself in deciding the vital question on contract for sale and fell into an error of law in not deciding the issue on a reference to the evidence on record. It is in fact, not a case of non-consideration of evidence but a case of total failure to draw the le­gal effect of the document coupled with other attend­ing and surrounding facts, circumstances and other material evidence on record. Defendant’s positive case is one of total denial of the contract and that defen­dant No.2, who is the son of defendant No. 1, had no authority to sell or enter into any contract for sale of the suit property on behalf of defendant No.1.<br/> <br/>38. Let me quote the material findings of the High Court Division to see whether the approach of the High Court Division is in accordance with the well-established settled principles as enumerated by the various authorities in construing a vital docu­ment. The High Court Division observed in its judg­ments regarding exhibit 4 in the following terms:—<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Had she been present at the time of grant­ing receipt Ext. 4 dated 1.9.73, her signature would appear in Ext.4 in normal course and the plaintiff would also get her signature in Ext.4 if she was really present at the time of the said transaction. There is absolutely nothing in the contents of Ext.4. at all to show that it was be­ing written according to the direction of defen­dant No.1 or that she was present and had knowledge and consent in the matter or that she had accepted any money".</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>39. The High Court Division on the face and wordings of Ext.4 accompanied by exhibit 1 failed to find that the money receipt in fact shows a contract for sale. The trial Judge, of course, arrived at the le­gal effect of the document, considered (he other ac­companying oral evidences that came on record about two years after the receipt itself. The receipt per se no doubt speaks of a contract for sale indicating the consideration money, acceptance of earnest money and the schedule of properties. The only snag in the receipt is that the receipt was given by the son of the owner of the property. In the circumstances, the question of deciding the document itself, which, ac­cording to the plaintiff, is a vital document evidenc­ing a contract for sale, is to be independently consid­ered and ascertained along with the oral evidences as to whether the son had the authority to grant the re­ceipt and as to whether the mother in fact accepted the money and in her presence this receipt was grant­ed by the son. These are, in fact, matters which are to be decided no doubt by the courts below on a ref­erence to the oral evidences. But I am constrained to say that the High Court Division did not indepen­dently try to ascertain the effect of the document on its own wordings whatever may be the other contro­versies in the matter. The plaintiff had adduced evi­dence to show that the mother who was very old and invalid though present in the transaction could not sign the document as her hand trembled. The defen­dant No.1 herself admitted in her deposition that in 1971 her health had broken down and deteriorated thereafter. The son namely, defendant No.2 who de­posed in 1976, three years after the contract, testified that his mother was aged about 75 years. This is the testimony of the defendants themselves. Along with it, PWs 1 and 2 also testified about the old age and ill-health of the mother. The High Court has not said a word either believing or disbelieving those witnesses. The explanation of not signing Ext.4 as appeared in evidence of the parties may cither be ac­cepted or not, but the High Court Division has also not given any reasons for disbelieving this positive evidence in this regard. The High Court Division's approach was that if the money receipt would have borne the signature of the mother, then the whole transaction would have been proved. Since the docu­ment Ext.4, does not bear the signature of defendant No.1, the learned Judges were called upon to ascer­tain the effect of the document on the whole transac­tion and then to judge independently the surrounding evidence on record to judge the nature of contract in the present case. Defendant No.2, in his written statement as well as in his testimony before the trial Court, deposed that Tk. 10,000/- was forcibly left in the office of this defendant who reluctantly issued Ext.4 but the receipt itself shows that it contains clear recital of total consideration amount, acceptance of earnest money and the schedule of property in re­spect of which the money was taken. Thus, it is not a case of pure oral contract but it is a case of oral contract evidenced by a money receipt which is es­sentially a document of contract for sale in the present case. This Ext.4, is the direct foundation of the plaintiffs claim and it is, therefore, clear that the High Court Division failed to arrive at a finding that the contract is a concluded contract and enforceable in law.<br/> <br/>40. While reading the material and relevant portion of the judgment of the High Court Division I am surprised to see that the High Court Division tried to approach the case totally on a wrong angle and misdirected itself in appreciating the nature of transaction. In the present case with reference to the lawyers' notice, Ext.6 dated 17.11.73, the High Court Division observed as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"In the letter Ext.6 dated 17.11.73 written by the plaintiff’s Advocate Mr. Md. Nurul Huda it was stated that defendant No.2's mother had contracted to sell for the total consideration of Tk. 2,50,000/- on receipt of earnest money of Taka 10,000/- through him (defendant No.2) on 1.9.73, but it is significant to note that the plaintiff or the plaintiffs Advocate did not address any letter to defendant No.1 Mst. Zohura Khatoon".</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>41. The High Court Division gave undue em­phasis on Ext. 6, the lawyers' notice dated 17.11.73 sent by the plaintiff after about two and half months of the contract, requesting the defendant No.2 to fin­alise the deed of sale in pursuance of the agreement for sale without further delay. The approach of the High Court Division was that the plaintiffs' advocate did not address any letter to defendant No.1 and that this letter was written after about 12 weeks after granting of receipt, Ext.4 dated 1.9.73. The plain­tiffs case is that defendant No.2, being the son of de­fendant No.1 as agent and karjakarak of his mother, entered into the sale on behalf of his mother with her knowledge and as such the lawyers' notice was given to the son soon after the plaintiff came to know that the defendant No.2 was negotiating with others to sell the land. I am afraid, the subsequent lawyer's no­tice demanding fulfillment of contract cannot be con­sidered to determine the effect and worth of Ext.4. This also shows that the High Court Division found fault as the letter was not addressed to the defendant No.1 by the Advocate concerned. It may be men­tioned here that the plaintiff soon after getting the re­ply of his lawyer's notice from defendant No.2 filed the present suit on 15.12.1973. Thus for the forego­ing reasons, as stated above, it is apparently clear that the High Court Division did not give any find­ing with regard to the points on which leave was granted, nor the judgement of the trial Court was re­versed by the High Court Division as the first appel­late Court on those findings. In view of this, I have no option but to set aside the judgement of the High Court Division being not a proper judgment of re­versal as found in a case reported in <em><strong>36 DLR (AD)52</strong></em>, wherein it has been held as follows:—<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Reasonings that have been given by the High Court Division are not in accordance with the well-established principle for reversing a de­cision of the trial Court and in this view of the matter this appeal must be allowed".</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Following the decision of the case in <strong>Nafar Chandra Pal Vs. Shukur </strong>reported in<strong> Indian Appeals (Vol. XLV) —183.</strong> Their Lordships of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in <em><strong>PLD 1966 Supreme Court 612</strong></em>, <strong>Mr. Justice Hamoodur Rahman</strong> while delivering the judgment of the court observed as follows: —<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"We see no reason to depart from this enun­ciation of law and applying the tests in the present case we find the question that fell for consideration was as to what was the true intent of the parties to be gathered from the terms of the compromise. In order to ascertain this true intent the surrounding facts and circumstances could legitimately be looked into but this did not, in our view, make it a question of fact, for, the question never the less remained as to what was the legal effect of the said compromise decree. In any event, since the appeal in the High Court was a first appeal even questions of fact were open, for they were not concluded by concurrent findings."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of <em><strong>The Midnapur Zamindary Co., Ltd. Vs. Uma Charan Mandal and others reported in 29 CWN—131, </strong></em>Their Lordships of Privy Council held as follows: —<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Where the question to be decided is one of fact, it does not involve an issue of law merely because documents, which were not instruments of title or contracts or statutes or otherwise the direct foundations of rights but were really his­torical material, have to be construed for the purpose.<br/>There is no ground for a second appeal upon a question of fact unless it can be shown that the lower Appellate Court misdirected itself in point of law in dealing with this question upon the evidence."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>42. Thus, on the principle of law as enunciat­ed, the High Court Division misdirected its mind in construing this vital document as the same is the basic foundation of the plaintiff’s claim, apart from the other questions raised at the trial. The defendants case is one of denial only, while admitting the exe­cution of the money receipt Ext.4, which is essen­tially a document of contract and this misdirection has resulted in a serious error of law occasioning a failure of justice for which this court must interfere.<br/> <br/>43. For the foregoing reasons stated above, both on law and fact, I hold that the judgment and decree of the High Court Division is liable to be set aside and that of the trial Court restored.<br/> <br/>44. Consequently, the appeal is allowed and the suit is decreed without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong><u>Order of the Court</u></strong><br/> <br/>By the majority decision, the appeal is dis­missed. There will be no order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
