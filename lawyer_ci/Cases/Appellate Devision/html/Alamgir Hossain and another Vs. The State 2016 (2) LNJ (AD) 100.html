A confessional statement of a co-accused is a matter for consideration against another accused if tried jointly with him.      . . . (19)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 3 and 30</strong><br/><strong>Section 30 of the Evidence Act simply makes </strong><strong>the confession of a co-accused a relevant fact.</strong><strong> In other words, the confessional statement of a co-accused is admissible against other persons in the sense that it may be taken into consideration against them along with other </strong><strong>evidence. But for this section 30, the confessional</strong> <strong>statement of one accused will be inadmissible</strong><strong> in evidence against another accused in view of section 3 of the Evidence Act. The statement of a co-accused does not fall within the definition of evidence as given in section 3 of the Evidence Act. The simple reason is that it is not made on oath; that it is not made in presence of the accused and that its veracity is not tested by cross-examination. It is, therefore, a very weak evidence against co-accused if it is regarded as evidence under section 30. The High Court Division erred in </strong><strong>taking the confessional statements of co-accused</strong><strong> Ratan Miah and Edu Miah as substantive evidence and maintained the conviction of the appellants without corroboration by any independent evidence.          . . . (20 and 25)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 8</strong><br/><strong>Absconsion by itself is not conclusive evidence</strong><strong> to infer either of guilt or guilty conscience. The fact that the appellants absconded soon after the crime was committed is no evidence by itself. It may only lend weight to other evidence. Abscondence cannot be treated to </strong><strong>be corroboration of the confessional statement</strong><strong> of other co-accused so as to base thereon the conviction of the absconding accused. Even an innocent man may feel panicky and to evade arrest and trial may abscond when suspected of grave crime like murder. Abscondence by itself was not conclusive proof of guilt or guilty conscience of an accused but it might lend support to other evidence on record.     . . .

No.653/1998 of the Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Comilla.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Both the criminal appeals involving similar questions of laws and facts have been heard together and are being disposed of by this common judgment.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The relevant facts for the purpose of disposal of these criminal appeals are:</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Informant, Nurul Amin lodged a First Information Report (FIR) on 13.11.1998 with Comilla Kotawali P.S. alleging that on 12.11.1998 his son, victim Jamal Hossain, who was a rickshaw puller, deposited his rickshaw in the garage of its owner and went to the Doulatpur Majarsharif to attend its weekly gathering. The people present there saw him upto 00.30 hours (13.11.1998), but his son did not return home. On the following morning his dead body was recovered from the Mahogany garden belonging to Yasin Miah located towards the north-east of the Neku Brick field, Doulatpur. The informant and his relatives found a dead body with innumerable marks of injury caused by knife on various parts of his body and the tendon of his left heel was cut-off, unknown person or persons had murdered his son between 00.30–06.00 hours of 13.11.1998 and left his dead body inside the said garden. The information gave rise to Kotwali Police Station Case No.20 dated 13.11.1998.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">During investigation, Edu Miah, Ratan Miah, Monjil Hossain and Ramija Khatun were arrested on suspicion and forwarded to the Court of the Magistrate. Accused Edu Miah and Ratan Miah were taken on remand and thereafter, their confessional statements were recorded under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by a Magistrate, First Class, Comilla. After investigation, police submitted charge sheet No.148 dated 31.03.1999 in respect of 8(eight) accused persons, including the appellants alleging offences under sections 302/201/34 of the Penal Code. On 13.01.2002, charge was framed under sections 302/201/34 of the Penal Code against the appellants and 2 (two) others, who were present in the Court and also against the absconding accused persons, namely, Monjil Hossain, Ramija Khatun, Morshed Alam and Johara Bibi. The accused persons present in the dock pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In order to substantiate the prosecution case, prosecution examined 16(sixteen) witnesses, who were cross-examined on behalf of the accused persons present in the dock and also cross-examined by the State defence lawyer appointed on behalf of the absconding accused. From the trend of the cross-examination of the witnesses by the defence, the defence case appears to be one of innocence.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Upon consideration of the evidence and materials or record, the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Fourth Court, Comilla, convicted absconding accused Morshed Alam under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code and sentenced him to death. The accused, namely, Edu Mia, Ratan Mia, Alamgir Hossain (appellant) and Babul Mia (appellant), who faced the trial were convicted under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code and sentenced to suffer imprisonment for life and also ordered to pay a fine of Tk.20,000/- each, in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 6(six) months more. Three other accused persons, namely, Ramiza Khatun, Johura Khatun and Monjil Hossain were acquitted of the charge leveled against them.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A reference under section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was sent by the learned Sessions Judge, Comilla to the High Court Division for confirmation of the sentence of death of the above named condemned-prisoner which was registered as Death Reference No.39 of 2005.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Convict-appellant Alamgir Hossain preferred Criminal Appeal No.1509 of 2005 and convict-appellant Babul Mia preferred Criminal Appeal No.1556 of 2005 which were heard along with Death Reference No.39 of 2005. The learned Judges of the High Court Division upon hearing both the sides by the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 20.01.2009 accepted the death reference and dismissed both the criminal appeals with connected jail appeal.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed by the High Court Division, the accused Alamgir Hossain filed Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No.248 of 2009 and accused Babul Mia filed Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No.249 of 2009 before this Division. In both the lave-petitions, leave was granted on 12.02.2012, resulting in Criminal Appeal Nos.15-16 of 2012.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Khorshid Alam Khan, learned Advocate, appearing on behalf of the appellants of both the criminal appeals, submits that the confessional statement of a co-accused is only evidence against the maker but the same has no evidentiary value against other co-accused except only to lend assurance to other evidence and as such, the affirmation of conviction and sentence by the High Court Division based on confessional statements having not been corroborated by evidence either oral or circumstantial is not tenable in law. He further submits that none of the witnesses examined by the prosecution disclosed anything in Court implicating the accused-appellants, but they have been implicated only by the confessional statements of the co-accused Edu Mia and Ratan Mia, which were not corroborated by any independent witness and as such, the order of conviction and sentence relying on such confessional statements is not tenable in law. He also submits that mere absconsion of the appellants for a long time cannot by itself sufficient to prove the guilt of the appellants and as such, relying on their mere abscondence of the appellants cannot be found guilty in the absence of other corroborating evidence.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Basir Ahmed, learned Assistant Attorney General, appearing on behalf of the State-respondent of both the criminal appeals, on the other hand, supports the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court Division. He further submits that the prosecution has been able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and as such, no interference is called for.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocate for the appellants of both the appeals and learned Assistant Attorney General for the State-respondent of both the appeals, perused the impugned judgment and the materials on record.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Before entering into the merit of the appeals, it would be pertinent to go through the grounds, for which, leave was granted. The grounds are quoted below:  </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“I.  Because a confessional statement of a co-accused is only evidence against the maker but the same has no evidentiary value against other co-accused except only to lend assurance to other evidence, and further the same is never evidence as contemplated in the definition of “evidence” contained in section 3 of the Evidence Act, and the affirmation of conviction and sentence by the High Court Division, based upon confessional statements having not corroborated by circumstances, is not tenable in law.<br/>II.   Because none of the witnesses led by the prosecution disclosed anything in Court implicating the accused-petitioners, but they have been implicated only by the confessional statements of the co-accused Edu Mia and Ratan Mia, which were not corroborated by any independent witnesses, the confirmation of conviction and sentence relying on such confessional statements is not tenable in law.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Admittedly, there is no direct evidence against the appellants except the confessional statements of accused Ratan Mia and Edu Mia. Relying on the long abscondence of the appellants and the confessional statements of co-accused persons, namely, Ratan Mia and Edu Mia, the High Court Division came to a finding that the prosecution had been able to bring home the charge against the appellants under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">P.W.1, Nurul Amin, father of the deceased Jamal Hossain, is the informant of the case. In his evidence, he stated that his son Jamal Hossain, a rickshaw puller, went out of the house with a rickshaw on 12.11.1998. He came home at noon and took his lunch and went away with his rickshaw in the afternoon. He plied the rickshaw till 11 p.m. and after that he went to a Mahfil at Fakirbari. He did not return home at night. On the following morning the informant got news that the dead body of his son had been lying in the Mehagani garden located on east of Fakirbari. He rushed to the place of occurrence and found innumerable marks of injuries on the body of his son. Local Union Parishad Member and the Chairman and others came to the place of occurrence. Police prepared the inquest report of the dead body and took the signature of the informant on it. Subsequently, he lodged the FIR which was marked as exhibit-2 and his signature as exhibits-2/1. After about 2 hours police arrested accused Ratan Mia, who on interrogation admitted that Edu, Babul, Morshed, Alamgir, Monjil, Johora Bibi, Ramiza Bibi murdered Jamal at the house of Morshed and kept the body in the Mehagani garden. The police recovered the knife and blood stained cloth from the house of Ramiza Bibi. Accused, namely, Ramiza Bib, Monzil Hossain, Ratan Miah and Edu Miah made confessional statements under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The informant identified the accused persons present in the dock. In cross-examination, he stated that the FIR was written by the police at the Police Station. On the night following 13.11.1998, the police arrested accused Ratan of Balutupa. He could come to know that Ratan and others murdered his son.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Prosecution also examined P.W.2, Md. Shafiqul Islam, P.W.3, Abul Miah, P.W.4, Joynul Abedin Bahani, P.W.5, Abul Hossain, P.W.6, Ali Ahmed, P.W.7, Mostafa Sarwar, P.W.8, Abdur Razzak, P.W.9, Kala Mia, P.W.10, Shahjahan, P.W.11, Md. Bachchu Mia, P.W.12, Md. Mazibur Rahman, P.W.13, Md. Faruque, P.W.14, Dr. Md. Golam Mostafa, P.W.15, Md. Mostafa Kamal, Sub-Inspector and P.W.16, Md. Mozakker Ali, Magistrate First Class.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It has been already stated that there is no eye-witness to the occurrence. The trial Court convicted the appellants solely relying on the confessional statements of accused-Ratan Miah and Edu Miah and also on consideration of their long abscondence immediately after the occurrence. Having gone through the confessional statements of accused-Ratan Miah and Edu Miah, we find that they implicated the appellants in the occurrence.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A confessional statement of a co-accused is only evidence against the maker but the same has no evidentiary value against other co-accused except only to lend assurance to other evidence. A confessional  statement of a co-accused is a matter for consideration against another accused if tried jointly with him. It has been stated in section 30 of the Evidence Act as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“30. When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the Court may take into consideration such confession as against such other of such persons as well as against the person who makes such confession.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">This section simply makes the confession of a co-accused a relevant fact. In other words, the confessional statement of a co-accused is admissible against other persons in the sense that it may be taken into consideration against them along with other evidence. But for this section 30, the confessional statement of one accused will be inadmissible in evidence against another accused in view of section 3 of the Evidence Act. The statement of a co-accused does not fall within the definition of evidence as given in section 3 of the Evidence Act. The simple reason is that it is not made on oath; that it is not made in presence of the accused and that its veracity is not tested by cross-examination. It is, therefore, a very weak evidence against co-accused if it is regarded as evidence under section 30.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of <strong><em>Bhuboni Sahu vs. The King, 2 DLR, Privy Council,39,</em></strong> it has been held as under:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“Section 30 seems to be based on the view that an admission by an accused-person of his own guilt affords some sort of sanction in support of the truth of his confession against others as well as himself. But a confession of a co-accused is obviously evidence of a very weak type. It does not indeed, come within the definition of “evidence” contained in section 3, Evidence Act. It is not required to be given on oath, nor in the presence of the accused, and it cannot be tested by cross-examination. It is a much weaker type of evidence than the evidence of an approver which is not subject to any of these infirmities. Section 30, however, provides that the Court may take the confession into consideration and thereby, no doubt, make it evidence on which the Court may act; but the section does not say that confession is to amount to proof. Clearly there must be other evidence. The confession is only one element in the consideration of all the facts proved in the case; it can be put into the scale and weighed with the other evidence. There Lordships think that the view which has prevailed in most Courts in India, namely, that the confession of a co-accused can be used only in support of other evidence and cannot be made the foundation of conviction, is correct.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of <strong><em>Maqbool Hussain vs. State 12 DLR (SC)217,</em></strong> it has been held as under:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“We next take up consideration of the question whether section 30 of the Evidence Act could not be called in aid of the prosecution in support of the appellant’s conviction. Assuming that statements of a confessional nature were made by the co-accused of the appellant, to the Tahsildar, affecting themselves and the appellant, section 30 of the Evidence Act merely provides that the Court “may take into consideration” such confessions as against the appellant, as well as against their makers. The language of the section is very guarded and lends no warrant to the inference that such a statement made by a co-accused could be treated as substantive evidence against the other person, sufficient to sustain his conviction. It is well settled that there ought to be other evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, linking such a person with the crime, before a confession made by a co-accused could be adverted to, in adjudging the guilt of that person.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Reliance may be placed on the case of <strong><em>State and another vs. Abdul Kader @ Mobile Kader and others (2015) 67 DLR (AD)06.</em></strong> It has been held as under:  </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“The Court cannot proceed with the case relying on the confession of co-accused; it must begin with other evidence and after it has formed its opinion with regard to the quality and effect of the said evidence, then it is permissible to turn to the confession in order to receive assurance to the conclusion of guilt which the judicial mind is about of reach. If there is no other evidence against co-accused except the confession, then, the confession by itself being merely a matter to be taken into consideration, and not being an evidence under section 3, no conviction of the co-accused could be given relying on such confession.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Reliance can be placed in this connection on the cases of <strong><em>State vs. Fazu Kazi, 29 DLR (SC)271, Haroon Haji vs. Maharashtra, AIR 1968 SC 832, Kashmira Singh vs. Modhya Pradesh, AIR 1952 SC 159, Jayendara Saraswami Swamigal vs. State of TN (2005)2 SCC 13 (para 10) and Sidharth vs. State of Bihar,(2005)12 SCC 454</em></strong>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In view of the principle expounded in cases referred to above, we are of the view that the High Court Division erred in taking the confessional statements of co-accused Ratan Miah and Edu Miah as substantive evidence and maintained the conviction of the appellants without corroboration by any independent evidence.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Admittedly, both the appellants had been absconding soon after the occurrence and the police could arrest them after submission of the charge sheet. Absconsion by itself is not conclusive evidence to infer either of guilt or guilty conscience. The fact that the appellants absconded soon after the crime was committed is no evidence by itself. It may only lend weight to other evidence. Abscondence cannot be treated to be corroboration of the confessional statement of other co-accused so as to base thereon the conviction of the absconding accused. In this connection reliance may be placed on the case of <strong><em>Amir Hossain Howlader vs. The State (1984)BLD (AD)193,</em></strong> in which, it has been held that absconsion of an accused is corroboration of the direct evidence of eye-witnesses connecting the accused with the crime but absconsion of an accused cannot be treated to be corroboration of the confessional statement of another accused so as to base thereon conviction of the absconding accused. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">Even an innocent man may feel panicky and to evade arrest and trial may abscond when suspected of grave crime like murder. Abscondence by itself was not conclusive proof of guilt or guilty conscience of an accused but it might lend support to other evidence on record. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">In this connection, we may consider the case of <strong><em>State vs. Siraj Mondal @ Siraj (2008)8 BLC 52,</em></strong> in which, it has been held as under:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“Section 8 of the Evidence Act lays emphasis upon the conduct of an accused as one of the influencing factors in resolving his guilt. But this could not be treated as an unfailing evidence against him unless other evidence on record was sufficient enough to hold him guilty. Abscondence by itself was not thus conclusive proof of guilt or guilty conscience of an accused but it might lend support to other evidence on record.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Reliance may also be placed on the case of <strong><em>State vs. Sree Ranjit Kumar Pramanik 45 DLR 660, Ashraf Ali Munshi vs. State 48 DLR 590</em></strong>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Having gone through the evidence on record, we find that such other evidence as required for corroboration of abscondence was lacking in the case.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the light of the findings made before, we find substance in these appeals. Accordingly both the criminal appeals are allowed and the order of conviction and sentence passed against both the appellants of two appeals are set aside. They be set at liberty if not wanted in any other connection.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ed. </strong></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><hr/><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title=""><strong><u>C</u></strong></a><strong><u>riminal Appeal Nos. 15-16 of 2012. </u></strong><br/>(From the judgment and order dated 20.01.2009 passed by the High Court Division in Death Reference No.39 of 2005, Criminal Appeal Nos.1509 and 1956 of 2005 and Jail Appeal No.370 of 2005).</div></div></div></div>
