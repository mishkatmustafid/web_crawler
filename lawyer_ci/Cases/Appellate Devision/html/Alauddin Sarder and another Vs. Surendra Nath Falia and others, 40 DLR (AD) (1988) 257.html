Plaintiff-respondent filed Title Suit No. 45 of 1977 in the 1st Court of Munsif at Madaripur for a declaration that the auction sale-by the Circle Offi­cer, (Revenue), Rajoir, Madaripur on 9th June 1967 in respect of 9, 14 decimals of land as described in the Kha Schedule land of the plaint in Case No. 1145 R.A. of 1959-60 and the lease granted of the same property on its basis to defendant Nos. 1 and 2 are il­legal, void and without jurisdiction.<br/> <br/>3. Facts of the case according to plaintiffs are: The disputed land appertaining to R.S khatian No.517 of mouza Shiraj Kathi originally belonged to the predecessors of some of the plaintiffs, and pro-forma defendant Nos. 4-19. The rent roll was not correctly prepared. Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 in collu­sion with Tahsilder managed to file a Certificate Case No. 1145 R.A. of 1959-60 and by suppression of notices and sale proclamation managed to pur­chase the land in the name of the Government5. Some of the certificate debtors were already dead. After the emergence of Bangladesh plaintiffs filed objection before Circle Officer (Revenue), Madaripur. Miscel­laneous Case No.XII-37 of 1973-74 was started and on 27th July, 1974 Tk.325.80 was deposited. The disputed auction sate was then set aside by the Circle Officer (Revenue), Madaripur. Defendant No. 1 man­aged to lake settlement of the disputed land on the strength of certificate sale in Miscellaneous Case No. XII-M-717 of 1969-70 and No. XII-M-718 of 1969-70. Further, defendant Nos. 1 and 2 never got possession of the land though, however, he managed id get the order of setting aside the sale cancelled in case No. XIII-37 of 1973-74. Defendant No.1 also instituted several criminal cases against the plain­tiffs.<br/> <br/>4. Defendant Nos. 1, 2 and 3 filed two separate written statements contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit as framed was not maintainable and barred by limitation and also pleaded the bar of section 42 of the Specific Relief Act as no consequential relief was prayed for. According to defendants, Certificate Case No. 1145 R.A. of 1959-60 was started for arrear of rents and the disputed land was sold in auction on 9th June 1961 and sale was confirmed on 10th Au­gust 1961. The land was purchased by the Govern­ment and possession was delivered on 4th Novem­ber, 1961. After the disputed land was settled with defendant Nos. 1 and 2 possession was delivered to them in Case No. XII-M-717 of 1969-70 and No. Xn-M-718 of 1969-70. Two kabuliyats were execut­ed by the defendants and registered on 21st June 1974. Defendants asserted possession of 6 acres of land. They denied title and possession of plaintiffs.<br/> <br/>5. Suit was dismissed by the trial Court which decided the relevant issues against the plaintiffs. Its decision was affirmed by the first appellate Court which held that the suit was barred by limitation and not maintainable.<br/> <br/>6. Being aggrieved plaintiff-respondents moved the High Court Division under Section 115(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure. Rule issued in Civil Revi­sion Case No. 195 of 1982 was made absolute in part. The learned Judge of the High Court Division held that the lease granted in favour of defendant nos. 1 and 2 was false, fraudulent and null and void. Though, however, the learned Judge did not set aside the auc­tion sale.<br/> <br/>7. Defendant-appellants moved this Court and obtained special leave to appeal on the following terms:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Mr. Md. Nurul Huq, learned Advocate- on-Record has urged that the High Court Division erred in holding that the record was silent about delivery of possession while Ext. A-1(2) clearly shows that the possession was delivered as early as on 21.11.61 and, as such, the suit which is re­quired to be filed under section 36 of the Public Demands Recovery Act within one year from the date of delivery of such possession but hav­ing been filed as late as on 3.2.77 after 16 years was barred by limitation. He also submitted that the suit was clearly barred under proviso (B) of section 36 of the Public Demands Recovery Act which prohibits such a suit while the plaintiffs already agitated the matter before the Certificate Officer under section 23 of the Act and lost the same on 5.12.75. The learned Advocate also contended that the learned Single Judge commit­ted error of law in holding that the physical pos­session was not necessary to uphold the settle­ment made by the Government and that only remedy available for the plaintiffs, while the ob­jection under section 23 of the Public Demands Recovery Act being unsuccessful was by way of appeal, revision or review under sections 51, 53 and 55 of the Act and not by filing the present suit."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>8. Mr. Md. Nurul Huq, Advocate-on-Record, who appeared on behalf of the defendant- appellants submitted that in view of the provisions of section 36 of the Public Demands Recovery Act which re­quired the plaintiffs' suit to be filed within one year from the date of delivery of possession was barred by nearly 16 years. According to him, the delivery of possession was found to have been made on 21st November 1961, whereas plaintiffs' suit was filed on 3rd February 1977. Section 36 of the Public De­mands Recovery Act reads as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"36. Notwithstanding anything herein­before contained, a sale of immovable property in execution of a certificate shall not be held to be void on the ground that the notice required by section 7 has not been served; but a suit may be brought in a Civil Court to recover possession of such property or to set aside such sale on the ground that such notice has not been served, and that the plaintiff has sustained substantial injury by reason of irregularity:<br/>Provided that no such suit shall be entertained-<br/>(a) if instituted more than one year from the date on which possession of the property was delivered to the purchaser, or<br/>(b) if the certificate-debtor has made appear­ance in the certificate proceeding, or has applied to the Certificate-officer under section 22 or sec­tion 23 to set aside the sale."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>9. It also appeared that the plaintiff-respondents had moved the Certificate-officer under section 23 of the Act but lost the case on 5th December 1975. Even counting from this date plaintiffs' suit was filed beyond one year, the suit was, therefore, barred under the provisions of the aforesaid Act. Plaintiff-respondents could have resorted to the provisions of appeal, revision or review as contained in sections 51, 53 and 54 of the Act but did not do so. The learned Advocate-on-Record also, pointed out that in spite of the concurrent findings of- fact regarding the holding of auction sale, confirmation of sale and de­livery of possession which appeared in official records, the learned Judge of the High Court Divi­sion reversed the decision of the 1st appellate Court. Finally, Mr. Huq submitted that in view of the provisions of section 42 of the Specific Relief Act also the suit was barred as no prayer was made for consequential reliefs. Since the Government took possession of the disputed land in execution of the certificate sale on 4th November 1961 and gave settlement of the same to defendant- appellants on ac­cepting kabuliyats on 3rd November 1974 from them such prayer for consequential reliefs should made.<br/> <br/>10. Mr. S. S. Haider, Counsel for the plaintiff-respondents, submitted that in view of the restora­tion of Certificate Case No, 1145 R.A. of 1959-60 by an order of the Certificate Officer on 20th Febru­ary 1972 the settlement of the disputed land with the appellants by the acceptance of the kabuliyats dated, 3rd June 1974 became illegal. Moreover, the plain­tiff- respondents deposited Tk. 325.80 on 27th July 1974. Mr. Haider also assailed the settlement being illegal on the ground that the order of the Circle Of­ficer (Revenue) on 5th December, 1975 cancelling the order of setting aside the auction sale was an ex-parte order. He further submitted that the suit was neither barred by limitation nor barred under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act.<br/> <br/>11. To determine the respective contentions of the learned Counsels reference to a few dates will be useful in clarifying the true position. Plaintiffs' suit for declaration of their title and for declaration that the auction sale of "Kha" schedule land of the plaint in case No.1145 R.A. of 1959-60 on 9th June 1961 was false, fraudulent and void was filed on 3.2.77. The progress of this case which culminated in the auction sale, confirmation of sale and delivery of possession appears from the following order sheet, Ext. Al(2):<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"<strong>15.4.59:</strong> Certificate under section 4 signed. Register and issue notice under section 7 returnable by 21.9.59.<br/><strong>11.2.60:</strong> S.R. received. No payment made and no objection filed. Issue notice under section 46 fixing 5.4.60.<br/><strong>17.4.61:</strong> Notice N/46 duly served. No ob­jection filed. Issue S.P. to be served on the No­tice Board, Thana Notice Board and Kismat fix­ing sale on 9.6.61.<br/><strong>9.6.61:</strong> Sale held to-day. No outside bidder. Sold to Government, at 2 paisa paid. Put up on 10.8.61 for confirmation of sale.<br/><strong>10.8.61:</strong> 60 days expired from the date of sale. No objection, the sale is confirmed.<br/><strong>21.11.61:</strong> Possession delivered no objec­tion. The case is disposed of. Note in Register."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>12. No steps were taken by the plaintiff-respondents until after the emergence of Bangladesh, nearly 11 years after the delivery of possession was made in the aforesaid certificate case. The plaintiff-respondents filed objection in Miscellaneous Case No. XII-37 of 1973-74 and deposited the aforesaid amount upon which the Circle Officer (Revenue) set aside the auction sale. In the meantime, however, the disputed land which the Government had taken pos­session of in pursuance of the certificate sale in Mis­cellaneous Case No.XII-M-717 of 1969-70 and No. XII-M-718 of 1969-70 was settled with the de­fendant-appellants who executed two registered kabuliyats on 21st June 1974 and since the settlement they have been in possession of the disputed land.<br/> <br/>13. Ignoring the clear provisions of law as con­tained in section 36 of the Public Demands Recovery Act for setting aside an auction sale plaintiff-respondents had, it appears, moved the Circle Officer (Revenue) for setting aside the impugned sale in 1973 and succeeded in obtaining the order for setting aside the sale. This being clearly contrary to law was set aside or cancelled. On 5th December, 1975 the following orders were passed by the Circle Officer (Revenue) vide Ext. Al-3:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong><u>"Meno No. I145RA/69-60</u></strong><br/><strong>XIII-37/73-74</strong><br/>Back page: 5.12.75: The case is taken up for suo motu decision. It has come to my knowledge that the lands of R.S. 517/SA, S.A. khatian No.535 of 79. No Serajkati Mouza were not free from encumbrances as a total area of 6 acres of land under plot Nos. 1193, 1194,1195, 1196 and 1197 were entitled with one Amjad Ali Sk, and one Zoinuddin Sarder of P.S.

Hence ordered that the order dated 20.2.74 be cancelled. The petitioners may take shelter in the compe­tent court if they desire. The money deposited by them may be refunded on proper prayer. In­form the party concern and the TDR, Amgaon accordingly".</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>14. Strangely enough, plaintiff-respondents kept quiet until as late as 3rd February, 1977 when they filed the present suit. Even after moving the Circle Officer for setting aside the auction sale which was granted but ultimately cancelled by the Circle Officer on 5th December 1975, plaintiff-respondents did not seek any relief against the order of cancella­tion within time.<br/> <br/>15. So far as the plaintiff-respondents alleged collusion and fraud in holding auction sale they could not substantiate the allegations. The trial Court referred to the evidence regarding issuing of notices and sale proclamation and did not find any ir­regularity therein. His findings were affirmed by the first appellate Court. Defendant-appellants were not in the picture when the auction sale was held or con­firmation and delivery of possession was made. They appeared in the scene in 1974 when settlement of the disputed land was made by the Government by ac­cepting the kabuliyats executed by them on 21st June 1974. As already mentioned above, no fraud as alleged by the plaintiff-respondents has even been proved against either the Government or the defen­dant-appellants.<br/> <br/>16. It appears that by realising the difficulties as discussed above the learned Judge of the High Court Division did not set aside the auction sale but declared the lease granted in favour of defendant-appellant Nos. 1 and 2 as false, fraudulent, null and void as was prayed for by the plaintiff-respondents. In our opinion, if the auction sale stands, plaintiff-respondents can no longer claim any right, title and interest in the disputed land. Since possession was delivered to the Government which made the disputed land khas and were giving eksana leases to different persons during the years beginning from the date of delivery of possession till the Government settled the land with the defendant-appellants. Their right was lost. Whatever legal remedies were available to the plaintiff-respondents for setting aside the auction sale in time were not resorted to by them. They twice got the opportunity to do so, once immediate­ly after the auction sale was held and delivery of pos­session was made and again in 1972-73 when they came to know of the auction sale. Even after being unsuccessful in setting aside the auction sale which appeared from the order of the Circle Officer (Reve­nue) on 5th December 1975, plaintiff-respondents did not file the present suit but waited till the period of limitation for filing such a suit expired. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case and also because no consequential reliefs were sought for by them as required under section 42 of the specific Relief Act the present suit appears to be not main­tainable.<br/> <br/>17. In the result, the appeal is allowed with costs and the judgment of the High Court Division is set aside and that of the trial Court is restored.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
