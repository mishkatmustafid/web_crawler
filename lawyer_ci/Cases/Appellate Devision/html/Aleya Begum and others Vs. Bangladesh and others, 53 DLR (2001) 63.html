The petitioners having lost their home and hearth situated in different parts of Bangladesh due to river erosion and natural calamities, came to Dhaka and constructed long ago structures and dwellings in <em>Balur Math Basti</em> in Section 12, Block. ‘E’ Mirpur to have shelter therein with their families with knowledge of all concerned.<br/> <br/>3. In the united Nations Conference held in Vancouver on May 31, June 14, 1976 recommendation was made to provide shelter, infrastructures and services to less advantaged (Annexure-A) and that in the meeting of the ‘<em>Nagar Daridra Beshayak Jatiya Parishad</em> held on 9-4-90 under chairmanship of the then President of the country problems of slum dwellers in Dhaka City were discussed and decision was taken for developing facilities for sanitation, health care, water supply and medical treatment of slum dwellers (Annexure-B) and that an agreement between Government of Bangladesh and United Nations Capital Development Fund was executed for re-settlement of 2600 squattor families in Mirpur (Annexure-C and D) and project in Islambagh Rasul Bagh and Shahid Nagar was undertaken government financed by the World Bank for improvement of slum dwellers (Annexure-E) UNICEF and Ford Foundation financed warns credit project approved by Ministry of Women Affairs on Grameen Bank Model (Annexure-F,F G, G(1) and that ‘<em>Dhaka Mohanagar Basti Samasya Nirasan Committee</em>’ set up by Ministry of Land Administration submitted report with recommendation for rehabilitation and redressed slum dwellers and government accepted the same in September, 1989 (Annexure-H). and that ‘Dhaka Municipal Corporation formed <em>“Basti Punarbasan Jami Nirbasan Committee”</em> to identify lands for rehabilitation of slum dwellers of Dhaka City and Annexure ‘J’ is the report of the committee for the purpose of <em>Basti Punarbashon</em>.<br/> <br/>4. Subsequently government also adopted the existing policy and Minister for LGRD held a meeting on 27-12-91 in Secretariat and made press reports (Annexure-K and K (1) about rehabilitation of slum dwellers of Dhaka City. In spite of above process the Housing and Settlement of the Ministry of Works without any scheme for rehabilitation of the slum dwellers of <em>Balur Math Basti</em> including the petitioners submitted a new scheme to the Ministry of Works for allotments of 226 plots in <em>Balur Math Basti</em> under Rupnagar site and service extension project aiming at eviction of the existing slum dwellers including the petitioners therefrom and that being apprehensive of above move the petitioner No. 4 on behalf of slum dwellers of <em>Balur Math Basti</em> Section Block ‘E’ approached Bangladesh Human Rights Commission which sent the same vide Memo dated 3-12-91 (Annexure-L) to Prime Minister to stop above proposed allotment in the said <em>Basti</em> as per Rupnagar Project and that Prime Minister’s secretariat forwarded to respondent No.1 the said representation for necessary action vide memo dated  7-1-92 (Annexure-M) and Ministry of Works vide memo dated 11-1-92 (Annexure-N) requested respondent No. 3 to put up detailed information in the matter and that Chief Slum Development Officer Dhaka Municipal Corporation vide Memo. dated 20-7-92 (Annexure-O) asked respondent No. 4 to give particulars of lands where slum dwellers of Dhaka be rehabilitated and that respondent No. 2 vide Memo, dated 26-10-92 (Annexure-P) informed Superintending Engineer Housing and Settlement representation of slum dwellers was not acceptable as the same lands were earmarked for the Rupnagar Project and that Superintending Engineer asked vide Memo, dated 24-11-92 (Annexure-Q) for preparation of Maps showing the places where slum dwellers have been living in the <em>Basti</em> area.<br/> <br/>5. Respondent No. 2 without any step for preparation of maps as directed requested vide Memo, dated 3-3-93 (Annexure-K) the Superintending Engineer to take steps for eviction of the petitioners and others from the <em>Balur Math Basti</em> and that Superintending Engineer requested respondent No. 6 vide Memo. dated 9-3-93 (Annexure-R(1) for action for eviction of the petitioners although petitioner No. 4 filed representation dated 7-3-93 (Annexure-L) requesting respondent No.1 to stop earth filling work on the land in <em>Balur Math Basti</em> land and that respondent No.6 vide Memo dated 29-3-93 (Annexure-T) asked the Superintending Engineer to submit report on representation dated 7-3-93 and that Superintending Engineer sent vide Memo, dated 11-4-93 (Annexure U) to respondent No. 2 directing him to submit detailed report in the concerned matter and that in the meanwhile respondent No. 6 vide Memo dated 8-4-93 (Annexure-V) requested respondent No. 7 for deployment of police force for eviction of the petitioners and others.<br/> <br/>6. Thus being aggrieved the petitioners moved this Court with the writ petition for Rule restraining respondents from evicting them without providing alternative arrangement for their rehabilitation elsewhere and also to declare the Memo dated 8-4-93 (Annexure-V) to be without lawful authority. The writ petition was filed on 3-5- 93 and it was moved on 15-6-93 in presence of Deputy Attorney-General when it came to light that the petitioners were already evicted from the land. Accordingly, the Rule was issued in the above terms with regard to see whether there was due compliance and observation of provisions of Act 24 of1970 before the said eviction as alleged.<br/> <br/>7. Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 entered appearance through learned Deputy Attorney- General and filed separate affidavit-in-opposition to contest. Respondent No. 2 filed supplementary affidavit-in-opposition. Respondent No. 1 stated that Balur Math area was the acquired land of the government and unauthorised dwellers on the land were evicted with the help of police force accompanied by Magistrate on 28-4-93. Before that notices were issued on 21-4-93 and duly served on the dwellers. Besides, arrangement was made for announcement through mike on 22-4-93. Electric and mike service shop supplied mike and battery and submitted voucher for Taka 500.00 which was accordingly paid by the concerned office.<br/> <br/>8. The voucher is Annexure 1 ‘A’ paper relating to deputation of two Magistrates 1st Class at the time of eviction and papers about delivery of possession after eviction are filed as Annexure 1 and 2.<br/> <br/>9. Respondent No. 2 denied the allegations and claim of the petitioners. It has been stated that all Annexures filed along with the writ petition including A, B, G, G (1), H, J, K, K (1), M, N, having no direct concern with the land in <em>Balur Math Basti</em> which in fact is the acquired land of the government vide LA Case No. 5/72-73 and 13/59-60 as evident from Annexure -3 series. That the lands in <em>Balur Math</em> area in section 12 Block-E were allotted to different persons in connection with Rupnagar site and services Extension Project vide Annexure-4 series. The petitioner and others being unauthorised dwellers on the said land were already evicted on 28-4-93 long before filing of the writ petition on 3-5-93 and that before eviction process notices under provisions of Act, 24/70 were duly issued and served on the said occupants. Besides, announcement through mike was also made in the area.<br/> <br/>10. That in the supplementary affidavit-in-opposition by respondent No. 2 it has been stated that low lying ditches on the land of Balur Math area in section 12 Block-‘E’ were covered up by earth filling work by engaged contractor in order to improve the land for allotment in connection with Rupnagar site and services and Extension Project. The petitioner and other dwellers being unauthorised occupants had no legal right to hold over there. That they were earlier removed with police help but subsequently they came into the land and the dwellers on the land were duly evicted with police help accompanied by two Magistrates and papers relating to allotment under Rupnagar Project and eviction process have been filed as Annexures 5-8. The petitioners having been evicted before filing of the writ petition from the land through process of law under provision of Act 24/1970 having no legal right over the land the Rule is liable to be discharged.<br/> <br/>11. Learned Advocate for the petitioners submits that slum dwellers problem is not only a problem in Bangladesh alone, but also it is the problem faced by almost all countries of the world and, as such, it was discussed in the conference of the UNO held in Vancouver on 31st May - Jun 1, 1976 wherein some recommendations were made in that respect. He refers to Annexures ‘A’ i.e. the report of the said UNO conference on human settlements wherein recommendation was made to provide shelter, infrastructures and services to less advantaged. Bangladesh being a member participant in the said conference is required to go by the said sentiment displayed therein. He submits that government of LGRD. Ministry identify lands for rehabilitation of slum dweller Dhaka City and Annexure ‘J’ is the report with recommendation of the said committee identifying different lands for rehabilitation of the said slum dwellers of Dhaka City. He submits that Annexure K ( 1) are the press reports of the Minister for PW about construction of plots in section 11 and 12 of Mirpur for slum dwellers with Aid from,  Asia Development Bank. He submits that from above Annexures indication is available that government of Bangladesh did not lag behind in such respect and manifestation of the anxiety of the government of Bangladesh is available from Annexures B, H, I, J, K-K (1). He shows from Annexure ‘B’ that in the meeting of <em>‘Nagar Daridra Bisayak Jatiya Parishad’</em> held on 9th April, 1990 under the chairmanship of the then president discussion was held about ‘Mahanagar Basti Samasya Nirasan’ and some discussions were made for practical solution of the problem in such regard. He shows from Annexure ‘H’ that ‘<em>Dhaka Mahanagar Basti Samasya Nirasan’</em> committee formed by Dhaka Municipal Corporation submitted recommendation for solution of the problem of slum dwellers and the said recommendation was accepted by the authority in September, 1989. He also shows Annexure ‘J’ which is the sub-committee for vide circular dated 21-4-90Bangladesh has been concerned with the problem of slum dwellers and its solution thereof.<br/> <br/>12<strong>.</strong> Learned Advocate refers to Annexure C, D, E and shows that an agreement was executed between government of Bangladesh and United Nations Capital Development Fund for resettlement of 2600 squatter families in Mirpur (Annexure C &amp; D) and projects in Islam Bagh, Rasul Bagh, Shahid Nagar are also undertaken by Government and financed by World Bank (Annexure-E). He submits that from above facts it is demonstrated clearly that the lives of petitioners and other slum dwellers of <em>Balur Math Basti</em>, Mirpur area are interwoven with the efficacy of the total scheme undertaken by the government. He points out that in the event of their eviction the petitioner will be deprived of their right to life and will also be denied the access to institutional loans for developing their capacity for self employment, health facilities, nutritional Programme, educational Programme provided by various NGO’s, skill development and training Programme provided by various agencies and employment opportunities and informal occupations available in the vicinity. He further submits that Ford Foundation, UNICEF and other Donor Agencies working in Bangladesh became concerned about the living condition of <em>Basti</em> people and took various programmes for poverty alleviation providing credit, sanitation, family planning education and other facilities so that Basti people may survive. He also submits that Ministry of Social Welfare and Women Affairs approved scheme like Women Credit projects in the <em>Balur Math Basti</em> on Grameen Bank model. Allocations have been made by Ford Foundation and UNICEF vide Annexure-F-F (1) and these are approved by said Ministry vide Annexure – G-G (1).<br/> <br/>13. Learned Advocate points out that being apprehensive of eviction process by the authority petitioner No. 4 made representation to Human Rights Commission to stop allotment of lands of <em>Balur Math Basti</em> in connection with Rupnagar Project and it was sent vide Annexure ‘L’ to Prime Ministers Secretariat for action wherefrom it was sent to respondent No. 1 vide Annexure-M and therefrom vide Annexure-N detailed report in the matter was called for from respondent No. 3. He also points out that meanwhile vide Annexure dated 20-7-92 chief slum development officer Dhaka Municipal corporation asked respondent No. 4 to supply particulars of lands where slum dwellers may be rehabilitated. He also shows from Annexure P dated 26-0-92 by respondent No. 2 to Superintending Engineer that representation vide Annexure-L’ was not acceptable as the lands are earmarked for Rupnagar Project. He refers to Annexure R, R (1), T, U, V and submits that respondents proceeded with eviction process although vide Annexure ‘Q’ Superintending Engineer asked for maps showing places for rehabilitation of slum dwellers. He contends that illegally eviction was carried out by the respondents without any care for compliance of the provisions of Act 24 of 1970. According to him, compliance was mandatory and due to non-compliance the petitioners are entitled to get restoration of their possession of the land wherein they had been residing as slum dwellers before alleged eviction inasmuch as the eviction as already carried out without proper service of notice will lead to the deprivation of the livelihood of the petitioners and consequently to the deprivation of their right to life.<br/> <br/>14. Learned Advocate for the petitioners refers to the decision in the Case of <em><strong>Olga Tellis and others Vs. Bombay Municipal Corporation and others </strong></em>and<em><strong> Vayyapuri Kuppusauni and others Vs. State of Maharastra and others</strong> </em>reported in <strong><em>AIR 1986 Supreme Court 180</em> </strong>wherefrom he shows some observations as regard the principle of natural justice. Observation is as below-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“In our view the principles of natural justice know of no exclusionary rule dependent on whether it would have made any difference if natural justice had been observed. The non- observation of natural justice is itself prejudice to any man and proof of prejudice independently of proof of denial of justice is unnecessary. It comes from a person who has denied justice that person who has been denied justice is not prejudiced.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Further observation is as below-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“Justice must not only be done but must manifestly be seen to be done. The appearance of injustice is the denial of justice. It is the dialogue with the person likely to be affected by the proposed action which meets the requirement that justice must also be seen to be done. Procedural safeguards have their historical origins in the notion that conditions of personal freedom can be preserved only when there is some institutional check on the arbitrary action on the part of public authorities.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>With eviction process although vide Annexure ‘Q’ Superintending Engineer asked for maps showing places for rehabilitation of slum dwellers. He contends that illegally eviction was carried out by the respondents without any care for compliance of the provisions of Act 24 of 1970. According to him, compliance was mandatory and due to non-compliance the petitioners are entitled to get restoration of their possession of the land wherein they had been residing as slum dwellers before alleged eviction inasmuch as the eviction as already carried out without proper service of notice will lead to the deprivation of the livelihood of the petitioners and consequently to the deprivation of their right to life.<br/> <br/>It has been further observed as below-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“Whatever its outcome, such a hearing represents a valued human interaction in which the affected person experiences at least the satisfaction of participating in the decision that actually concerns her and perhaps the separate satisfaction of receiving an explanation of why the decision is being made in certain way. Both the right to be heard from and the right to be told why are analytically distinct from the right to secure a different outcome. These rights to interchange express the elementary idea that to be a person rather than a thing is at least to be consulted about what is done with one.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Further observation has been made as below-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“Trespass is a tort. But even the law of Tort requires that though a trespasser may be evicted forcibly the force used must be no greater than what is reasonable and appropriate to the occasion and what is even more important the trespasser should be asked and given a reasonable opportunity to depart before force is used to expel him.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">The ordinary rule which regulates all procedure is that persons who are likely to be affected by the proposed action must be afforded an opportunity of being heard as to why that action should not be taken. The hearing may be given individually or collectively depending upon the facts of each situation. A departure from this fundamental rule of natural justice may be presumed to have been intended by the legislature only in circumstances which warrant it. Such circumstances must be shown to exist. When so required the burden being upon those who affirm their existence.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>15. Showing above observations learned Advocate argues that the principle of natural justice was not observed by the respondents by strict compliance of the provisions of Act XXIV of 1970 before so-called illegal eviction. He thus contends that the Rule must be made absolute.<br/> <br/>16. Learned Deputy Attorney-General appearing for respondent Nos. 1 and 2 submits that at the time of issuance of the Rule it was clear before the Court that the writ petitioner were meanwhile evicted from the alleged <em>Basti </em>area and as such the Rule was issued simply to examine whether provisions of Act 24 of 1970 were complied before said eviction of the slum dwellers including the petitioners from the land in question. He submits that now the only question before this Court is to see to the compliance of the provisions of the said Act before eviction process was taken up. He submits that all other points as agitated by the petitioners through Annexure ‘A-V’ do not call for any decision inasmuch as those Annexures are not likely to have any bearing in the matter of decision and disposal of the Rule. He does no dispute that there is slum dwellers problem in Bangladesh and also does not dispute that government of Bangladesh as a member of the UNO from time to time displayed its anxiety for the solution of the problem and it can not be disputed that the government of Bangladesh from time to time displayed some good gesture in the matter as evident from the Annexures filed on behalf of the petitioners. But learned Deputy Attorney-General clearly contends that the government did not take up any conclusive and definite decision and Programme with regard to the <em>Balur Math Basti</em> section 12 Mirpur about solution of problems of the slum dwellers including the petitioners claiming to be living therein.<br/> <br/>17. He then turns to the main point as to the observance and compliance of the provisions of Act 24 of 1970 before eviction of the petitioner and others from the <em>Balur Math Basti</em> area in section 12 Mirpur. He submits that the petitioner and other slum dwellers came upon the land as mentioned unauthorised trespassers and quite illegally constructed slums therein creating problems. He points out that the lands are not Khas land, rather the lands were acquired by the government in LA Case No. 5/72-73 and 13/59-60 as evidenced from Annexure 3 series and those lands are now allotted to different persons by the government in connection with Rupnagar site and Services Extension Project as evident from Annexure 4 Series. He argues that the petitioner and other slum dwellers have no legal right to come upon the government acquired lands illegally to construct slums therein to reside by creating positive problems. Referring to other Annexures as filed on behalf of respondent Nos. 1 and 2 learned Deputy Attorney-General submits that earth filling work was already taken up in connection with the said Rupnagar Project duly initiated by the government and in such connection legal processes were initiated to make the lands free from the unauthorised occupation of slum dwellers including the petitioner and provisions of Act 24 of 1970 were duly observed and complied through issuance and service of notices and also simultaneously through mike announcement in the area. He also argues that in order to have delivery of possession of the lands from those slum dwellers Magistrates were deputed to help the police in the matter of completion of eviction process.<br/> <br/>18. In order to explain in detail his above contention learned Deputy Attorney-General refers to Annexures 5, 6, 7 filed on behalf of respondent No. 2 on 23-7-98 in the affidavit-in-opposition and Annexure 8 filed in the supplementary affidavit-in opposition on 21-8-2000. Annexure-8 is the memo dated 21-4-93 by which notice of eviction was issued by respondent No. 6 under the provisions of Act 24 of 70 as amended vide Presidents Order 85 of 1972. He shows from Annexure 5 that sanction and approval was given by the competent Authority of Housing and Settlement for eviction of the slum dwellers from the land<em>Balur Math Basti</em> Block-E section 12 Mirpur as earmarked for Rupnagar Project. He also shows from Annexure 6 and Annexure 1 memo dated 26-4-93 by respondent No. 6 to respondent No. 7 for deputing police force to help the Magistrate for completion of eviction process. He also refers to Annexures 2 and 7 which being the same eviction report about taking possession of the land by Housing and Settlement authority on due completion of the eviction process on 28-4-93. Learned Deputy Attorney-General also refers to Annexure- 1A which is the voucher or payment receipt of Taka 500.00 for Mike announcement in slum area for vacating the place within the specified time. From above Annexures filed on behalf of respondent Nos. 1 and 2 particularly Annexures 8 i.e. notice of eviction dated 21-4-93 and Annexures 1 and 7 eviction report dated 28-4-93 and Annexure-1A i.e. payment receipt for mike announcement dated 22-4-93 learned Deputy Attorney-General tries to show that provisions as to issuance and service of notice under provisions of Act 24 of 1970 were duly complied before the eviction of the slum dwellers including the petitioner from the land in question. He further contends that compliance of the said provisions of Act 24 of 1970 is not mandatory, rather it is directory. In that regard learned Deputy Attorney- General refers to chapter ‘Performance of public duty’ at page 369 of Maxwell on Interpretation of Statute eleventh edition and shows therefrom that service of the notice as to compliance of the provisions of Act 24 of 1970 as amended vide President’s Order 85 of 1972 is to be considered as directory and not mandatory. The neglect of the same may be penal and it will not affect the validity of the act done in disregard of the said provisions, if any. He refers to the decision in the Case of <em><strong>Forkan Ali Vs. Bangladesh represented by Secretary Ministry of Home Affairs and others </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> 20 BLD (HC) at 415 </strong></em>of in which one of us was a party and shows that in spite of using word ‘shall’ in section 6 (2) of Bangladesh Rules (Special Provision) Ordinance, 1976 it would be directory and not mandatory since consequence of non-compliance of the provision of that time limit is not provided by the legislature and it has been further held in the said decision that when a statute uses the word ‘shall’ prima fade it is mandatory but the Court may ascertain the real intention of the legislature by carefully attending to the whole scope of the statute. He refers to the provision of Act 24 of 1970 as amended vide President’s Order 85 of 1972 and shows that word ‘may’ is used both in the parent section and in amended provision and, as such, he contends that the compliance and observance of the provision as to service of notice within the specified time will be directory and not mandatory as non compliance if any is not followed by any consequence in the Act itself. In such regard learned Deputy Attorney-General also refers to the decision in the Case of <em><strong>Sharifuddin Vs. A Ghani</strong></em> reported in <em><strong>AIR 1980 (SC) 303</strong></em> where from he shows the difference between mandatory rule and directory rule. Mandatory rule is to be strictly observed whereas in directory rule substantial compliance may be sufficient to achieve the object, where whenever a statute prescribes a particular act to be in particular manner and also lays down that failure to comply with the said requirement leads to a specific consequence, it is to be considered as mandatory. Learned Deputy Attorney-General refers to paras 38, 42, 51 and 52 of the decision of the Case of <em><strong>Olga Tellis and others Vs. Bombay Municipal Corporation and others</strong></em> reported in <em><strong>AIR 1986</strong></em> <em><strong>(SC) 80</strong></em> wherein it was held that the commissioner under provisions of section 314 of Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, 1888 was justified in directing the removal of the encroachment committed on the pavements, foot paths and accessory roads without notice.<br/> <br/>19. Learned Deputy Attorney-General also refers to the decision in the Case of <em><strong>Divisional Superintendent Vs. Bashir Ahmed</strong></em> reported in <em><strong>PLD 1973 (SC) 589</strong></em> wherefrom he shows the observation of the Court to this effect that, “it is well established principle of interpretation that remedial statute should be construed in manner so as to advance the remedy and suppress the mischief or else it would frustrate the legislative intendment”. Learned Deputy Attorney-General also refers to the decision in the Case of <em><strong>Dr Mohiuddin Faruque Vs. Bangladesh </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> 49 DLR (AD)1</strong></em> (relevant page-9) wherefrom he points out the observation of the Court on the point of interest and standing of a party in the following manner-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“The Court will have to decide in each Case, particularly when objection is taken, not only the extent of sufficiency of interest but also the fitness of person for invoking the discretionary jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution. Ordinarily it is the affected party which is to come to the Court for remedy. The Court in considering the question of standing in a particular Case, if the affected party is not coming before it and if it finds no satisfactory reason for non-appearance of the affected party it may refuse to entertain the application. Learned Deputy Attorney-General contends that the writ petition is not tenable on that count also.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>20. He argues that in view of Annexures 5, 8, 1 and 6, 2 and 7 and 1(A) provisions of Act 24 of 1970 as amended vide President’s Order 85 of 1972 as to service of show cause notice of 7 days were duly complied and observed and, as such, the eviction carried out on 28-4-93 was quite in accordance with law and procedure. He further argues that the observance and compliance of the provisions of Act 24 of 1970 as amended vide President’s Order 85 of 1972 being directory any defect in the observance if disclosed or detected will not invalidate the act of eviction as already done inasmuch as vide aforesaid Annexure substantial compliance should be presumed to be sufficient and not strict compliance to the mandatory rule.<br/> <br/>21. He submits that the lands being acquired lands by the government vide Annexure 3 series and since the said lands have been meanwhile in the process of allotment to different persons vide Annexure 4 series question of restoration of the possession in respect of their earlier occupation therein can not be legally possible and desirable. In that regard he points out that nothing is produced before the Court along with the writ petition or at the hearing to show the specification with definite description by boundaries in respect of land in the respective occupation of the petitioners and other slum dwellers in <em>Balur Math Basti</em> Block-E, Section-12 Mirpur and in the absence of specific and definite description of lands in occupation of the petitioners the restoration process will be an impossible task even if the eviction be found without lawful authority.<br/> <br/>22. Pointing out all above facts and circumstances it is contended by learned Deputy Attorney-General that the Rule should be discharged.<br/> <br/>23. We have perused the writ petition and Annexures A-V filed along with the same. We have also perused the affidavit-in-opposition and supplementary affidavit-in-opposition filed by respondent Nos. 1 and 2 and also the Annexure 1-8 filed on behalf of the respondents. We have considered the submissions of both sides.<br/> <br/>24. Rule was issued only to examine whether the provisions of Act 24 of 1970 were duly complied and observed before the eviction of the petitioners from the land in question and also to see whether the said eviction should be declared without lawful authority due to non-observation of the said provision of law. But the petitioners agitated many other things in the writ petition and in support of those agitated points the petitioner submitted papers as Annexures A-V. During argument learned Advocate for the petitioners refers to those Annexures also. Although for the disposal of the Rule those facts are not necessary yet when from both sides submissions are made on those points we shall also make passing observation over the same.<br/> <br/>25. It is true that like all other countries of the world slum dwellers problem is also acute in Bangladesh and it is gradually taking a serious shape. Government of Bangladesh being a member participant in the conference of UNO held in Vancouver May 31 - June 14, 1976 is aware of the report submitted therein with recommendation to provide shelter; infrastructures and service to less advantage vide Annexure ‘A’. It is true that government of Bangladesh also displayed its anxiety over the issue in the meeting of <em>‘Nagar Daridra Bishayak Jatiya Parishad’</em> held on 9-4-90 under the chairmanship of the then President wherein decision was taken vide Annexure ‘B’ for developing facilities for sanitation, health care, water supply, medical treatment of slums dwellers. Subsequently, vide Annexures C and D agreement was executed between government of Bangladesh and United Nations Capitals Development Funds for re-settlement of 2600 squatter families and projects in such regard were undertaken in same places financed by World Bank for improvement of slum dwellers (Annexure E). UNICEF and Ford Foundation financed Women Credit Project approved by the Ministry of Women Affairs on Grameen Bank Model (Annexure F-F1 and G-G (1).<br/> <br/>26. <em>Dhaka</em><em> Maha Nagar Basti Samasya Nirasan Committee</em> formed by the Ministry of Land Administration submitted its report (Annexure ‘H’) with recommendation for rehabilitation of slum dwellers. Accordingly, Dhaka Municipal Corporation formed <em>“Basti Punarbasan Jami Nirbachan Committee”</em> to identify lands for rehabilitation of slum dwellers of Dhaka City, which submitted report (Annexure-J) on the issue. It also appears from Annexure K, K (1) that LGRD Minister made press statement on the said problem. Annexure L, M, N, 0, P and Q show that there had been correspondence between different authorities for solution of the said problem. Annexure R, R (1) S, T, U and V show that the respondents took up initiation to evict the petitioner and others from the lands of <em>Balur Math Basti</em> Block-E section 12 Mirpur as unauthorised and illegal occupants on the ground that the lands in question being government acquired lands have been allotted to different persons in connection with Rupnagar Project as evident from Annexure 3 series and 4 series filed by the respondent Nos.1 and 2. Nothing could be shown by any specific document and papers that Government ever undertook any definite Programme for the rehabilitation of slum dwellers occupying and of <em>Balur Math Basti</em> Block-E, Section-12, Mirpur. In that view there is no legal right accrued in favour of the petitioner to resist respondents from taking legal process and intimation initiative for their eviction from the government acquired lands vide Annexure 3 and which have been clearly formally allotted to different persons vide Annexure 4 series in connection with Rupnagar Project taken up by the government in due course of law.<br/> <br/>27. It is a fact no doubt that village people having lost lands and houses due to river erosion and other natural calamities move in large number with families to big towns specially Dhaka City and construct slum wherever they find vacant place to reside temporarily to find out employment or work for survival within the knowledge of all concerned. There is no timely and speedy move by any office or authority to remove the slums then and there nor there has been any positive precautionary Programme by any government Agency to guard always carefully so that floating people may not start constructing slums on any government vacant lands in order to create future problems in that regard. This is how slum dwellers problem gradually takes serious shape in Bangladesh also.<br/> <br/>28. In the decision in the Case of <em><strong>Ain-o-Salish Kendra (ASK)</strong></em> <em><strong>and others Vs. Government of Bangladesh</strong></em> reported in <em><strong>4 BLC 590</strong></em>, the High Court Division expressed the anxiety over slum dwellers problem in the following manner,<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“Our anxiety is also for those slum dwellers whose homes were bulldozed in the different slums, not only making those homeless floating people but creating unemployment and slum crimes. We appreciate the government effort to eradicate <em>mastans,</em> miscreants and terrorists from those slums but at the same time we find that in the process the innocent slum dwellers become victims of repression/oppression not only by the <em>mastan </em>and terrorist but sometimes through the government agencies. We also note that in order to ameliorate the sufferings of slum dwellers the government is running the <em>“Adarsha Gram” </em>for the homeless and river erosion people, <em>“Adarsha Gram</em>” Project and Project-2 provided land for distressed people for rehabilitation and meanwhile 7560 families have been rehabilitated in the Ashrayan Project and 48,647 families have been rehabilitated in the <em>Adarsha Gram</em> Project and 48,000 families have been rehabilitated in <em>Adsarha Gram</em> Project 2 and that with that end in view Bangladesh Krishi Bank carried out survey of 32 big<em> Basti</em>s and enlisted the names of the head of the families residing in the<em> Basti</em>s. The survey covered about 50,000 families, Krishi Bank then adopted a scheme for rehabilitation named <em>“Ghore Fera”.</em> The scheme seeks to help rehabilitate the uprooted and distressed families in the place of their original abode. Under the scheme, the Krishi Bank provides for transportation of these families to their respective place of residence and offer them loan, the amount of which varied depending on their need and occupation they want to adopt.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>We are in full agreement with the above view.<br/> <br/>29. As to the question of compliance and observation of the provisions of Act 24 of 1970 Annexures 1-1A, 2, 5-8 filed on behalf of respondent Nos. 1 and 2 deserve scrutiny. Annexure 8 is memo dated 21-4-93 issued from the office of respondent No. 6 having contents of show cause notice asking unauthorised occupants of the lands Block-B and E of Section-12 of Mirpur to vacate by 26-4-93 failing which to face eviction process from 27-4-93 with the police help accompanied by Magistrates. Annexures 2 and 7 are the same eviction report dated 28-4-93 which shows that eviction Programme and process was executed and completed on 28-4-93. Annexure-5 shows that in order to take up eviction process sanction approval was duly taken from the authority concerned. Annexure 1(A) shows that payment of Taka 500.00 was made for mike announcement on 22-4-93 in the slum area. It may be mentioned that Annexure 1(A) is the voucher or payment receipt for the purpose of mike announcement, and it contains the signature of one mali on stamp paper. It has the endorsement that mike announcement made from 9-00AM to 7-00 PM on 22-4-93. From Annexures 2 and 7 (eviction report) it appears that eviction was effected on 28-4-93 and in that Case it is obvious that in practice 7 days time was not given as per provision of section 5 of Act 24 of 1970 amended vide Presidents Order 85 of 1972. This is with regard to mike announcement and in respect of the service of show cause notice as issued vide Annexure 8 i.e. memo dated 21-4-93 by respondent No. 6, no paper or any service return is filed to show that the said notices were in fact served on any the petitioner or slum dwellers or at least on one A Malek General Secretary Al Amin <em>Dostha Kal Samity Balur Math</em> section-12, Block-‘E’ who was described in serial No. 4 of the said Memo (Annexure 8) and to whom its copy was sent by the office of respondent No. 6 as evident from said Annexure 8. Normally in the absence of any service return of the said show cause notice or any report by any one in such respect it will be presumed that notices were not served as required under provisions of Act 24 of 1970 as amended vide President’s Order 85 of 1972. So, there is nothing to show that show causes issued vide Annexure 8 were at all served on the petitioner or slum dwellers when the petitioners took the positive plea that without compliance and observance of the provisions of law (Act 24 of 1970 as amended vide President’s Order 85 of 1972) evicting process was taken up by the respondents. Considering above facts we are of the view that the provisions of section 5 of Act 24 of 1970 as amended vide Presidents Order 85 of 1972 in respect of 7 days show cause notice before eviction were not complied or observed by the respondents.<br/> <br/>30. Now pertinent question arises whether the compliance of the said provision as to service of notice under Act 24 of 1970 as amended vide President’s Order 85 of 1972 is mandatory or directory. Before we go for discussion in ‘the matter we may look at the section 5 of Act 24 of 1970 as amended vide President’s Order 85 of 1972.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“<strong>Section 5. Eviction of unauthorised occupant.-</strong> (1) If the Deputy Commissioner, on his own motion or on the complaint of or upon information received from any body or a local authority is satisfied after making such inquiry as he thinks fit, that a person is an unauthorised occupant, he may issue in the prescribed manner, a notice directing such person to vacate the land, building or part thereof in his occupation within a period of thirty days from the date of service of the notice:<br/> <br/>Provided that Deputy Commissioner may, where he is satisfied that thirty days’ notice will not be in public interest, reduce the period of such notice to not less than seven days” (Proviso is added vide President’s Order 85 of 1972).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>31. The contention of learned Deputy Attorney-General is that since word ‘may’ and not ‘shall’ is used in the section and also in the amended proviso vide President’s Order 85 of 1972 it will be directory and not mandatory and his further contention is that instead of strict compliance mere substantial compliance will be sufficient to achieve the object. In such connection learned Deputy Attorney-General refers to para 9 of, the decision in the Case of <em><strong>Sharifuddin appellant Vs. Abdul Gani Lone respondent</strong></em> reported in <em><strong>AIR 1980 (SC) 303</strong></em> wherein it was stated and held as below,<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“The difference between a mandatory and a directory rule is that while the former must be strictly observed, in the Case of latter substantial compliance may be sufficient to achieve the objective regarding which the rule is enacted………… The fact that the statute uses the word “shall’ which laying down a duty is not conclusive on the question whether it is a mandatory or directory provision. In order to find out the true character of the legislation the Court has to ascertain the object which the provision of the law in question is to subserve and its design and the context in which it is enacted. If the object of law is to be defeated by non-compliance it has to be regarded as mandatory. But when a provision of law relates to the performance of any public duty and the invalidation of any act done in disregard of provision causes serious prejudice to those for whose benefit it is enacted and at the same time who have no control over the performance of the duty, such provision should be treated as directory one, ………………………………whenever a statute prescribes that a particular act is to be done in a particular manner and lays down that a failure to comply with the said requirement leads to a specific consequence it would be difficult to hold that the requirement is not mandatory and the specified consequence should not follow.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Performance of public duty at page 369 in Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes Eleventh Edition as referred to by learned Deputy Attorney-General is as follows;<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“………where the prescriptions of a statute relate to the performance of a public duty, and where the invalidation of acts done in neglect of them would work serious generally in convenience or injustice to persons who have no control over those interested with the duty, yet not promote the essential aims of the legislature, such prescriptions seem to be generally understood as mere instruction for guidance and .government of those on whom duty is imposed or, in other words, as directory only. The neglect of them may be penal indeed, but it does not affect the validity of the act done in disregard of them. It has often been held, for instance, when an Act ordered a thing to be done by a public body or public officers and pointed out the specific time when it was to be done, that Act was directory only and might be complied with after the prescribed time.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>32. The decision in the Case of <em><strong>Md. Forkan Ali Vs. Bangladesh</strong></em> reported in <em><strong>20 BLD 415</strong></em> as referred to by learned Deputy Attorney-General contains following observations-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“When a statute uses the word ‘shall’ <em>prima facie</em> it is mandatory but the Court may ascertain the real intention of the legislature by carefully attending to the whole scope of the statute. For ascertaining the real intention of the legislature the Court may consider inter alia, the nature and the design of the statute and the consequence which would follow from construing it the one way or the other, the impact of other provisions whereby the necessity of complying with the provisions in question is avoided, the circumstances namely that the statute provides for a contingency of the non-compliance with the provisions, the fact that the non-compliance with the provisions is or is not visited by some penalty, the serious or trivial consequences that follow therefrom and, above all, whether the object of the legislature will be defeated or furthered.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>33. From above observations it is manifestly clear that in spite of use of word ‘shall’ the rule may not be mandatory inasmuchas the real intention of the legislature as to the whole scope of the statute has to be ascertained. Similarly, for the same reason also one rule may not be directory only because of the use of the word ‘may’ in the statute. The meaning and intention of the legislature must govern and these are to be ascertained not only from the phraseology of the provision but also considering its nature, its design and the consequences which would follow from construing it the one way or the other.<br/>34. Keeping the above principle in view of section 5 of Act 24 of 1970 as amended vide President’s Order 85 of 1972 should be looked into. It appears from the provision of section 5 of the above Act 24 of 1970 that a notice directing the person in occupation of land to vacate within a period of thirty days from the date of service of the same was prescribed but in the amended proviso vide President’s Order 85 of 1972 the period of notice been made not less then 7 days. Although word’ is used in the original section 5 of the Act and also in the subsequently amended proviso yet it may presumed that the rule is not directory but mandatory because the intention of the legislature as to the requirement of compulsory service of 7 days notice before eviction is easily ascertainable from the subsequent amended proviso. Therefore, there is no scope to argue that mere substantial compliance in the matter of service of notice will be sufficient achieve the object, rather strict compliance in such regard as to service of notice must be necessary. Contention and reference of learned Deputy Attorney-General to paragraph Nos. 38, 42, 51 and 52 of the decision in the Case of <em><strong>Olga Tellis and others Vs. Bombay Municipal Corporation</strong> </em>reported in <strong><em>AIR 1 986</em> </strong><em><strong>page 180</strong></em> as regard service of notice cannot be acceptable. In those paragraphs action of Bombay Municipal Commissioner for removal of encroachment on footpaths or pavements over which the public has the right of passage or access without notice under provision of section 314 of Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, 1888 was held to be reasonable, fair and just. In the same decision also it was held in paragraph No. 49 as below;<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“Trespass is a Tort. But even the law Torts requires that although a trespasser may be evicted forcibly, the force used must be no greater than what is reasonable and appropriate to the occasion and what is even more important is that the trespasser should be asked and given a reasonable opportunity to depart before force is used to expel him.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>35. In paragraph No. 47 of the said decision has been observed as below-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“Whatever its outcome such a h represents a valued human interaction in which the affected person experiences at least the satisfaction of participating in the decision that vitally concerns her, and perhaps the separate satisfaction as receiving an explanation of why the decision is being made in a certain way. Both the rights to be heard from, and the right to be told why, are analytically distinct from the right to secure a different outcome. These rights to interchange express the elementary idea that to be a person rather than a thing is at least to be consulted about what is done with one.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>36. We are, therefore, of the view that due and proper service of 7 days notice as per amended proviso vide President’s Order 85 of 1972 to the Act 24 of 1970 is mandatory and compulsory and non observance and non-compliance of the said provision will be fatal inasmuch as it will frustrate the purpose and intention of the legislation in question. On this similar question and point of law this Bench while deciding writ petition No. 59 of 1994 observed and held that initial 30 days notice in the Act and subsequent reduction of the period of notice to not less than 7 days through addition of the proviso vide President’s Order 85 of 1972 discloses the intention of the legislature that earlier provision of 30 days notice was not realistic as the unauthorised occupants would take undue advantage to frustrate and resist the eviction process. As the legislature intended the notice period to be mandatory, subsequent addition of the proviso was made to reduce the notice period from 30 days to 7 days and thus it was held therein that time limit of 7 days notice period of section 5 as amended vide Presidents Order 85 of 1972 is mandatory. We have no reason to change our above view.<br/> <br/>37. We have already observed that service of notice vide Annexure 8 was not proved at all. Mike announcement as evident from Annexure 1(A) does not prove the service of 7 days notice in accordance with law. So it appears that eviction vide Annexures 2 and 7 was carried out, in fact, without due and proper service of 7 days notice as compulsorily required under amended proviso to Act 24 of 1970 vide Presidents Order 85 of 1972. Such eviction cannot be considered to be in accordance with law and procedure. But it appears that lands in <em>Balur Math Basti</em> in Block-E, Section- 12, Mirpur are the government acquired land vide Annexure 3 series and it also appears that the said lands have been subsequently allotted to different persons in connection with Rupnagar Project as evident from Annexure 4 series. Admittedly, the petitioners had no legal right to go upon the lands. In the eye of law they are to be treated as unauthorised and trespassers. But even then justice demands that the trespassers also can not be evicted forcibly without notice and without giving chance to them to remove themselves willingly therefrom. Justice also demands that the slum dwellers should not be unkindly evicted without making any alternative arrangement for their rehabilitation as human beings. But in the instant Case nothing can be done at this stage when the petitioners were already evicted from the lands vide Annexures 2 and 7 on 28-4-93. Next questions arise whether there is any scope for restoration of the possession of lands to the petitioners wherefrom they were evicted on 28- 4-93. The answer will definitely be in the negative inasmuch as no papers are filed either with the writ petition or at the hearing containing positive and definite address of the petitioners with specific description of the lands with boundaries in their respective occupation in B lock-E, Section- 12, Mirpur before the eviction was carried out on 28-4-93. In the absence of any specific address with proper and positive description of land of their respective possession by boundaries in the area there can not be any restoration process.<br/> <br/>38. The decision in the Case of <em><strong>Dr Mohiuddin Faruque</strong></em> reported in <em><strong>49 DLR (AD) 1 (para-9)</strong> </em>and the decision in the Case of <strong>Divisional Superintendent Vs. Bashar Ahmed</strong> reported in <strong><em>PLD 1973 (SC) 589</em></strong> as referred to by learned Deputy Attorney-General are not applicable in the present Case in view of above facts and circumstances as already discussed.<br/> <br/>39. In view of above discussion we are clearly of the view that the provisions of section 5 of Act 24 of 1970 as amended vide President’s Order 85 of 1972 with regard to service of 7 days notice before eviction are mandatory and not directory. We are further of the opinion that the said mandatory provisions as to service of 7 days notice before eviction of the petitioners were not strictly complied and observed as evident from Annexures 1(A), 2, 7 and 8 filed on behalf of the respondents. We are again of the clear view that the petitioners being unauthorised illegal occupants and trespassers on the government acquired lands in Block-E, Section-12, Mirpur (<em>Balur Math Basti</em>) which have been meanwhile already allotted to different persons vide Annexure-4 series in connection with Rupnagar Project taken up at the initiative of the government itself, there being thus no scope for restoration of possession of the petitioners to the said lands wherein they were before eviction in special view of the fact that nothing could be produced or shown by them about their specific address therein with specific and definite description by boundaries of the plots in their respective occupation before eviction was carried out 2 and 7. We therefore see no scope to help the petitioners in any way in the above context.<br/> <br/>In the result the Rule is accordingly disposed of with the above observations.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
