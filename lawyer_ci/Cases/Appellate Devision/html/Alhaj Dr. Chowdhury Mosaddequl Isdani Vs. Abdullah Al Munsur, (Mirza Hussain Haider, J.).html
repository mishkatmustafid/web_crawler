Under such circumstances the nature of the function of the District Judge is required to be looked into to determine whether he is a persona designata or a Court.

Therein the law also provides “...... and the decision of the District Judge shall be final” which is similar to what has been contemplated in Section 64(2) of the said Ordinance. This Division in several decisions concluded saying the expressions “District Judge under section 43 of the said Ordinance means a ‘Court’ not<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>a ‘persona designata’”. it is clear that under all circumstances this Division in several cases categorically held that the decision of the District Judge in appeal either under section 32 or 43 or 64(2) is given by a ‘Court’ not by a ‘persona<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>designata’.

It is to be borne in mind that such question of ownership/title cannot be decided without taking evidence and without considering the documents placed by the parties before the appellate authority hearing an appeal under section 64(2) of the Ordinance. Moreover, the respondents also claimed that since the disputed 23 decimals of land have not been specified, eviction from the said unspecified land is illegal. From the above contention it appears that the ownership or title of the said 23 decimals of land is disputed. The general principle of law is any question as to title/ownership or specification of the scheduled land can only be considered/determined by a competent Court not in a proceeding under section 64 of the Waqf Ordinance, which is a summary proceeding in nature. Only question is to be decided in the said proceeding whether the evicted person was in illegal possession of a waqf property enrolled at the office of the Administrator under section 47(Chapter IV) of the Ordinance. Any person claiming any interest in any waqf property is required to make application to the District Judge under section 35(1) within certain time as provided in section 50 of the Ordinance. In the present case the respondents claim that they have been dispossessed from the property of their waqf estate in which they are beneficiaries. There arises a question whether the said 23 decimals of land belong to which waqf estate. Such dispute can only be resolved under section 50 read with section 35 of the Ordinance. But no such step has been taken by the present respondents. Since the respondents have raised such allegation they need to get the remedy in a competent forum<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">   </span>not in a summary proceeding under section 64 of the Waqf Ordinance.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">        </span>. . .(18)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Waqf Ordinance (I of 1962)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Section 64 (2)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Section 115</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">From the impugned judgment it appears that the High Court Division upon travelling beyond its revisional jurisdiction came to a finding that the waqf “is not a Waqf-E-Lila and rather it seems to be an Waqf-Ul-Awlad and the Administrator is not empowered from making decision of his own and rather he is required to adhere to the desire of the Waqf Estate in the nature of Waqf-Ul-Awlad which bears a clear and distinguished character from that of an Waqf-E-Lillah” on considering Annexure-A misconstruing the law and the fact that the revision does not arise out of a suit for declaration of title and recovery of possession or a suit under section 9 of the Specific Relief Act but is a matter arising out of section 64(2) of the Waqf Ordinance. The jurisdiction under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure is very limited. It has not empowered the revisional court to sit on appeal and take into consideration new facts placed before it through affidavit. It has the power to interfere with the judgment only when there appears error of law apparent on the face of the record occasioning failure of justice. It has already been discussed earlier that under a proceeding arising out of section 64 of the Waqf Ordinance there is no scope to decide title or any dispute regarding the property. Only thing is to be looked into in such proceeding is whether the property belongs to a Waqf Estate and whether the occupier of it is an illegal occupier.

Under section 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure “District Judged” means the limits of the jurisdiction of a principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction and “Judge” means the presiding officer of a Civil Court. In the General Clauses Act “District Judge” is defined to mean the judge of a principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction. Now question may arise when power is entrusted upon the District Judge then whether he is to act as a Court or as a person. A person is considered as an individual rather than as a member of a class. It may be a person specifically named or identified in law as opposed to the one belonging to an identified category or group. This allows a judge to be appointed to discharge some non-judicial functions. Such entrustment can be termed as “persona designata”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The term “persona designata” thus means a person designated individually or by name rather than as a member of a class to do some specific work. In the case of <strong>AK M Ruhul Amin Vs. District Judge and Appellate Election Tribunal, Bhola and others along with other disposed of civil appeals and civil petitions (38 DLR (AD) 173) </strong>this Division held “When one is designated not by name but by official designation it is a ‘Persona Designata’”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">   </span>It has further been held considering the definition given by law Lexicon of British India that “ The test to find out whether the person who is named as an individual or is designated by his office is the person who is selected to exercise the power by excluding others from the exercise of such power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>If the answer is in the affirmative then such person becomes a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>‘persona designata’.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It has further been held “ District Judge means the Court of District Judge and not an individual carrying the designation, he is obviously subordinate to the High Court Division.” It is to be seen whether the legislature by using the term “District Judge” in Section 64(2) of the Waqf Ordinance intended that the District Judge in disposing of a proceeding should act judicially meaning as a “Court” or as a “persona designata”. Under such circumstances the nature of the function of the District Judge is required to be looked into to determine whether he is a persona designata or a Court. If such functions reveal attributes of a Court, he exercises judicial power. When an authority exercises judicial power he is not a persona designata but a Court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In legal parlance the expression “persona designa” means a person who has been described in a statute or a legal instrument by his official designation, and his function may be judicial or may not be so. But if the function of the designated person is judicial in character then he is nothing but a “court” even though he is not described as a court but by official designation. The test is the power and function he has to discharge. In the case of <strong>IDBP (Bangladesh) Vs. M/s. Master Industries (26 DLR 157)</strong> it was held<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>“as the District Judge was required to exercise judicial power, while acting under the aforesaid section, he was not a ‘persona designata’ but a Court.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">12.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-ansi-language: EN;">The Waqf Ordinance 1962 in several other provisions provided appeal to the “District Judge”; one of those is section 43 of the said Ordinance.

This view has been taken by this Division in 38 DLR’s case mentioned earlier. The legislature having empowered the Waqf Administrator ‘to apply to the Deputy Commissioner to evict the trespasser from a particular waqf property or for taking steps for preventing such disturbance or obstruction as he deems fit’ and accordingly when the trespassers are evicted by the Deputy Commissioner upon holding survey and inquiry, as has been done in the present case, remedy has been given in the statute itself under section 64(2) to prefer an appeal before the District Judge so that the eviction/action of the Deputy Commissioner is tested/judged by the Court of law, as to its legality. Such remedy has been provided for “the person who has been aggrieved’ by such actions of the Deputy Commissioner pursuant to the waqf Administrator’s prayer and when such appeal is preferred and decided by the learned District Judge as per law, his decision is termed as “final” by the statute. Thus when the District Judge constitutes a Court, which he does under the aforesaid provision of law, he is always subordinate to the High Court Division and is amenable to its jurisdiction. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">15.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-ansi-language: EN;">From the above it is clear that under all circumstances this Division in several cases categorically held that the decision of the District Judge in appeal either under section 32 or 43 or 64(2) is given by a ‘Court’ not by a ‘persona<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>designata’.

It is claimed by the present appellant that 23 decimals of land of his Waqf Estate have been occupied by the present respondents No. 1 to 3. On the other hand, the respondents No. 1 to 3 claimed that 23 decimals of land along with other lands belong to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>their Emajuddin Ahmed Chowdhury Waqf Estate not<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>to the appellant’s Mohiuddin Ahmed Chowdhury Waqf Estate and as such they being the beneficiaries of the said Emajuddin Ahmed Chowdhury Waqf Estate are legally occupying the said 23 decimals of land. Thus, the said respondents claim that they have been illegally evicted from the lawful possession of their property without serving any notice by the Waqf Arbitrator or directing them to explain anything in respect of the allegations made in the application of the present appellant dated 15.6.2003. They also claim that the District Judge without considering the documents filed by the present respondents affirmed the eviction order committing error of law inasmuch as whenever such complicated matter arises the court must not hesitate to dispose of the same without calling for any evidence or witnesses from both the sides and inviting production of documents and scrutinizing of the said documents. It is also contended that the said 23 decimals of land, which is claimed to be the land of the present appellant is unspecified. As such the order of eviction and affirmance of the same by the District Judge is illegal.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">18.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-ansi-language: EN;">From the aforesaid pleadings it appears that the persons evicted from the property have raised a question as to which Waqf Estate is the owner of the said 23 decimals of land. It is to be borne in mind that such question of ownership/title cannot be decided without taking evidence and without considering the documents placed by the parties before the appellate authority hearing an appeal under section 64(2) of the Ordinance. Moreover, the respondents also claimed that since the disputed 23 decimals of land have not been specified, eviction from the said unspecified land is illegal. From the above contention it appears that the ownership or title of the said 23 decimals of land is disputed. The general principle of law is any question as to title/ownership or specification of the scheduled land can only be considered/determined by a competent Court not in a proceeding under section 64 of the Waqf Ordinance, which is a summary proceeding in nature. Only question is to be decided in the said proceeding whether the evicted person was in illegal possession of a waqf property enrolled at the office of the Administrator under section 47(Chapter IV) of the Ordinance. Any person claiming any interest in any waqf property is required to make application to the District Judge under section 35(1) within certain time as provided in section 50 of the Ordinance. In the present case the respondents claim that they have been dispossessed from the property of their waqf estate in which they are beneficiaries. There arises a question whether the said 23 decimals of land belong to which waqf estate. Such dispute can only be resolved under section 50 read with section 35 of the Ordinance. But no such step has been taken by the present respondents. Since the respondents have raised such allegation they need to get the remedy in a competent forum not in a summary proceeding under section 64 of the Waqf Ordinance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; mso-mirror-indents: yes; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">19.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Moreover from the record it appears that such allegation has firstly been made in the appeal filed under section 64(2) of the Ordinance which has been squarely dealt with by the appellate Court upon considering the pleadings of the present respondents and found that the allegations as to evicting them from their property illegally is not correct. The appellate Court in its judgment observed that the Waqf Administrator after receiving the complaint from the present appellant on 15.6.2003 issued show cause notice upon the present respondents No. 1 to 3 through the Assistant Waqf Administrator and their reply to the same being unsatisfactory and the administrator was satisfied that 23 decimals of the property of the present appellant’s Waqf Estate are in illegal possession of the present respondents thus the administrator invoked section 64(1) of the Ordinance and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>applied to the Deputy Commissioner to evict the illegal occupants. Pursuant to such prayer the Deputy Commissioner, as it appears from the record, of its own initiative, directed the Assistant Commissioner (Land) to inquire into the matter. In his turn the Assistant Commissioner after holding necessary enquiry and holding survey through the Kanungo found that the present respondents had indeed been occupying 23 decimals of the appellant’s waqf property.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The Deputy Commissioner on examining the report of the Assistant Commissioner became fully satisfied about the illegal occupation of 23 decimals of land by respondents No. 1 to 3 and passed the order for eviction on 13.9.2003. Accordingly the illegal occupants have been evicted. So the contention of the respondents that they have not been served with any notice or they have not been heard, as such, is without any basis.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">20.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-ansi-language: EN;">From the impugned judgment it appears that the High Court Division upon travelling beyond its revisional jurisdiction came to a finding that the waqf “is not a Waqf-E-Lila and rather it seems to be an Waqf-Ul-Awlad and the Administrator is not empowered from making decision of his own and rather he is required to adhere to the desire of the Waqf Estate in the nature of Waqf-Ul-Awlad which bears a clear and distinguished character from that of an Waqf-E-Lillah” on considering Annexure-A misconstruing the law and the fact that the revision does not arise out of a suit for declaration of title and recovery of possession or a suit under section 9 of the Specific Relief Act but is a matter arising out of section 64(2) of the Waqf Ordinance. The jurisdiction under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure is very limited. It has not empowered the revisional court to sit on appeal and take into consideration new facts placed before it through affidavit. It has the power to interfere with the judgment only when there appears error of law apparent on the face of the record occasioning failure of justice. It has already been discussed earlier that under a proceeding arising out of section 64 of the Waqf Ordinance there is no scope to decide title or any dispute regarding the property. Only thing is to be looked into in such proceeding is whether the property belongs to a Waqf Estate and whether the occupier of it is an illegal occupier.
