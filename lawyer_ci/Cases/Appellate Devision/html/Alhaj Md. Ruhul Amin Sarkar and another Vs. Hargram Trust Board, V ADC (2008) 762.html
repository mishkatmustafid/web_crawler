Ruhul Amin CJ.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment dated May 10, 2005 of a  Division Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 5276 of2002 discharging the Rule upon awarding cost Tk. 10,000/-.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong> The civil revision was filed against the judgment and decree dated August 6, 2002 of the 1st Court of Additional District Judge, Rajshahi in Title Appeal No. 151 of 1996 allowing the same and thereupon reversing the judgment and decree dated April 15, 1993 of the Court of Sub-ordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge) passed in Other Class Suit No. 58 of 1989 decreeing the same.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> The suit was filed seeking declaration of title and confirmation of possession in respect of the 'Ka' schedule land.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> The plaintiffs claimed title in the land in suit being in adverse possession since 1952 and thereupon sought for declaration of title and confirmation of possession.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> The land in suit belonged to Haragram Trust Board, Rajshahi wherein the petitioner and others were tenants of Haragram Trust Board and the said Board filed S.C.C. suit for eviction of the tenant Abdul Gaffar, that the said suit was decreed and the decree holder filed execution case. It is the contention of the plaintiffs that by filing the execution case on the basis of the decree obtained in S.C.C. suit as the defendant had denied the title of the plaintiffs, they were constrained to file suit.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> The suit was contested by the defendant i.e. 'Hargram Trust Board' Rajshahi stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit is barred by res-judicata since relationship between the plaintiffs and the defendant was decided in the S.C.C suit, that the S.C.C suit was decreed and the defendant of the said suit challenged the  decree passed in the S.C.C. Suit No. 13 of 1978 upto to the Appellate Division but without any success and it was held that the defendant of the said suit i.e. Abdul Gaffar was the tenant of the Haragram Trust Board and the plaintiffs came in the land in suit as subtenants of Abdul Gaffar who inducted the plaintiffs beyond the knowledge of the landlord -the Haragram Trust Board. It was also the contention of the defendant that the plaintiffs have filed the suit on untrue pretext only to continue possession in the land in suit illegally.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>  The learned Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge) decreed the suit on the finding that from the materials on record it is seen that the plaintiffs are in possession of the land over 12 years, that defendant has failed to establish that the plaintiffs are the tenants of the defen­dant, that the plaintiffs are enjoying the land since 1952 admitted by the D.W.I, that the suit is not barred by <em>res judicata</em> and that the plaintiffs are in possession and as such are entitled to the relief sought.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> The defendant i.e. 'Hargram Trust Board' went on appeal, Title Appeal No. 151 of 1996, and the appellate Court set aside the judgment and decree of the trial Court on the finding, that the relation­ship of the plaintiffs and the defendant having had been decided, earlier the question of acquiring title by adverse possession is not legally tenable and the suit filed by the plaintiffs is barred by <em>res judicata</em>, that the plaintiffs failed to establish their claim of acquiring title by adverse possession in the land in suit, that the plaintiffs have no right, title and interest in the land in suit.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>  The plaintiffs moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained Rule. The High Court Division on consideration of the materials on record held that "The learned Subordinate Judge most illegally decreed the suit by his judgment without considering the facts that the fate of the plaintiff-petitioners have already been decided in S.C.C. Suit No. 13 of 1978 and thereby sealed the fate of the plain­tiff-petitioners which in no circum­stances liable to re-open inasmuch as the present suit is hit by Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Furthermore, findings of the trial Court that the suit is not hit by Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure appears to be motivated one since it remained meticulously silent about the decision in S.C.C. Suit No. 13 of 1978 upto the Hon'ble Appellate Division". The High Court Division has further observed that "The trial Court decreed the suit upon misdirecting itself by not considering the decisions of the Hon'ble Appellate Division so passed in selfsame subject between the same par­ties........<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>  We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and perused the mate­rials on record. In the background of the materials on record the learned counsel felt difficulty in assailing the judgment of the High Court Division.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong> The High Court Division discharged the Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong> In the background of the materials on record we are of the view that the peti­tioners have filed the suit with the sole motive of continuing their possession in the land in suit unauthorizedly since in the background of the decree passed in S.C.C. suit No.13 of 1978 and affirmed by this Court petitioners' suit was noth­ing but a contrive to deprive the defendant of the fruit of the decree obtained by him in the S.C.C. suit and for enjoy­ing the property in suit for illegal gain. In our view the suit filed by the plaintiffs are frivolous one and at the same time sole object and purpose of filing the suit was nothing but to harass the defendant with the end in view of obtaining unjust advantage over the defendant.<br/> <br/>In that view of the matter we are of the view that plaintiffs should pay cost for vexations suit at Tk. 10,000/-.<br/> <br/>In the background of the aforesaid discussion on awarding cost at Tk. 10,000/-, the petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
