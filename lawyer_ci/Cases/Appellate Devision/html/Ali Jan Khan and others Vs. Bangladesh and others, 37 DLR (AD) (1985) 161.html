Facts, in brief, are as follows: Plain­tiffs instituted a suit being Other Suit No.48 of 1983 in the Court of 1st Munsif at Sadar, Chittagong on 15.2.83 for a declaration that that acquisition of land in L.A Case No. 2/82-83 is illegal, arbitrary, void and without jurisdiction and also for permanent injunction against the defendants Government of Bangla­desh and others. The plaintiffs alleged that the purpose for acquisition of land for extension of Hazrat Amanat Shah Dargah Sharif land is not a public purpose and the land has been   requisitioned for private purpose at the behest of Mutwalli on the plea of facili­tating free access of the visitors to the holy Dargah Sharif; that the requisition proceeding in the name of Chittagong Municipality Corporation as requiring body is a mere device for conferring benefits on private individual. It is mentioned that the total quantity of land in L.A. Case No. 2 of 1982-83 is 0.139 acres of which, 0.144 acres belonged to the plaintiff.<br/> <br/>3. The trial court after hearing parties came to the conclusion, that the requisition had been made for public purpose within the" meaning of Emergency (Land and Building) Requisition Ordinance being Ordinance No.11 of 1982 and it was concluded that such suits are barred by section 44 of the Ordinance and accordingly it rejected the plaint under Order 7, rule 11 C.P.C.<br/> <br/>4. On appeal to the appellate Court below view was taken that whether the purpose was public purpose could be decided on evidence and the trial court ought not to have-rejec­ted the plaint without proceeding to trial. The appellate Court below further found (a) there was no clear specification of land sough to be requisitioned in the notice, (b) and the pur­pose for which the land is requisitioned is a private purpose and not a public purpose, (c) that the bar imposed under section 44 of the Ordinance does not come into play. In this view of the matter the appeal was allowed and the order of the learned Munsif was set aside, and it was directed to dispose of the suit after taking evidence.<br/> <br/>5. Being aggrieved by the said appellate order the defendants filed revisional application before the High Court Division, The learned Single Judge after hearing the parties noticed the averments made in the plaint and concluded that the plaintiffs have not raised any objection about the non-specification of the land in their plaint, nor it was denied that they   were served with notice as required under the Ordinance II of 1982. As for purpose the learned Single Judge came to the conclusion that the, decision of the Government shall be conclusive evidence that the property is needed for public purpose or for the public interest vide section 5 of the Ordinance. As such it was concluded that there was no scope in the suit whether the properly sought to be requisitioned was for public purpose or not. Having observed thus the learned Single Judge expressed the view that "the court has unfet­tered jurisdiction to entertain a suit in spite of such bar to enquire into whether the actions taken are in conformity with law" and concl­uded that in the plaint no such case have been made out for coming to a decision that the purpose was not a public purpose. In this view of the matter the rule was made absolute and the judgment of the appellate Court below was set aside and those of the learned Munsif restored.<br/> <br/>6. Mr. M.H. Khondker, the learned Counsel appearing for the plaintiff petitioners urged that the suit should not have been rejected outright under Order 7, rule II in view of the section 4 read with section 44 of the Acquisition and Requisition of Immova­ble Property Ordinance No.11 of 1982 in­asmuch as whether the purpose is a public purpose or not is a question to be decided in the suit on evidence. The learned Counsel argued that since the plaintiffs had urged that the real purpose was to benefit the Mutwalli of the Dargah Sharif the Municipal Corporation was mere a name lender and it is at the behest of the Mutwalli that the requisition order had been passed. Mr. Khondker contended that if action is bonafide then the bar of sec­tion 44 comes info play but whether the action is bonafide or not can be decided on evidence in the suit. He relied heavily on the celebrated case of Mask reported in 44 C.W.N. 700 and 17 DLR   (SC) 515 and 34 D.L.R, (AD) 222 at page 235.<br/> <br/>7. The learned Counsel placed the entire plaint; before us and it seems that only allega­tion is made by the plaintiffs in paragraph 7 that the requisition had been made for facilita­ting ingress egress of the Mutwalli’s Vehicle and the requiring body, namely, the Municipal Corporation was got round for this purpose and in paragraph 9 it is mentioned that the plaintiffs even moved the Minister against order for requisition. But the Minis­ter decided in favour of the requisition and acquisition, OD the report of the local officials which without making any inquiry passed the order of requisition.<br/> <br/>8. The learned Additional Attorney Gene­ral Mr. A. W. Bhuiyan placed before the Court the entire file and on perusal of it. It appears that the requisition proceeding was started in 1982-83 for the purpose of expan­sion of the approach road to the shrine of Holy Amanat Shah Dargah where thousands of devotees do offer their Fateha every day. The lane which is proposed to be extended is an off-shoot from the main road and the app­roach road is only 60/70 feet in length. The lane being very narrow it was decided by the authority that for public convenience it should be widened. Hence requisition had been made for widening the approach lane. On the face of this, it is evident that the purpose was public purpose and the allegation of the plaintiffs that since it would confer additional benefit to the public is no ground for taking any other view. The main purpose of the Government is to widen the road for public benefit and if it confers indirect benefit to the Mutwalli namely by way of taking car near the shrine that does not mean that the purpose will be bereft of its character so as to make it a private purpose, in order to justify the allegation of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs did not seriously contend in plaint that the requisition is malafide, save and except making the allegations that it would wholly confer benefit, to the Mutwalli as aforesaid. Section) 5 of the Ordinance provides that the decision of the Government shall be the conclusive evidence that the property is needed for a public purpose. The High Court Division is correct in saying that if from the plea­dings it can be seen that the purpose does not appear to be in public interest the Civil Court's jurisdiction’s is not ousted by section 44 of the Ordinance. Mr. Khondker did not argue that the acquisition had been done without obser­ving formalities as laid down in the Ordinance itself though he made a grievance that the compensation has not been awarded. Section 10 provides for payment of compensation before taking possession of the property sub­ject to sub-section (2) and sections 7 to 9 provide for procedure and determining the compensation. The learned Additional Attor­ney General had placed before us that the compensation bad been assessed as far back as on 20.3.R3 fixing the date 24.3.83 for receiving the compensation. The suit was instituted in February, 1983 and it was rejec­ted by the learned Munsif on 10.5.83. The order of the appellate court below was passed on 22.12.83 remanding the case to the trial court. Thereafter the High Court Division on 25.10.84 made the rule absolute holding that the suit is barred under section 44 of the Ordinance. Possession of the property was taken on 29.10.84. So far the acquisition and requisition proceeding is concerned, we are satisfied that the acquisition was for the public purpose arid the law as provided in the Ordi­nance had been fully complied with.' Once it is held that the land; had been Requisitioned validity for public purpose section 44 barring the jurisdiction of a Civil Court comes into play and in this view of the matter there is no hesitation in saying that the High Court Division had correctly restored the order of trial court. The petition is therefore dismis­sed.<br/> <br/>9. Now we shall take up the petition for contempt being Miscellaneous Petition No. 46 of 1984 for committing for contempt. The plaintiffs petitioners alleged that this Court had passed an order on 1.10.84 staying the operation of the judgment and order dated 25.10.84 passed by the High Court Division, Chittagong Bench in C.R. No.63 of 1984 for four weeks. By circumventing this order the defendants, took possession by demolishing the structures on 1st and 2nd November, 1984. It is true that the High Court Division passed an order on 25.10.84. When questioned by the Court whether the necessary prayer was made, before the High Court Division to stay the operation of its order so as to enable (he plaintiffs to move the Appellate Division against its order Mr. Khondker frankly conceded that no such prayer either orally or by petition had been made. The sequence of events shows that on 26.10.84 the defendants served notice on the occupants to vacate the premises by 28.10.84 in view of the High Court's order, failing which possession would be taken through police force on 29.10.84. Mr. Bhuiyan placed before us the copy of the joint inventory that was made by the occu­pants who took away their materials on 28.10.84 and 29.10.84 and actually on 29.10.84, possession was handed over to the requiring body. Mr. Khondker made allegation that the inventory have been made by some other and stated in the petition by very liberal construc­tion it may be said that it includes the came of one of the petitioners herein viz. Ali Jan Khan named therein as "Md. Ali Jan son of late Ali Hossain" but contended that there is no petitioner by named Md. Ali Jan son of late Ali Hossain. It is a desperate argument inasmuch as we have seen the petition filed by Ali Jan himself on record praying for time which was filed and an order was recorded on 1.1.84 staying all further proceeding in view of the said, order granted by this Court. Therefore, it is clear that the plaintiff fully knew all the circumstances under whether possession was taken and it was within his knowledge that the possession was taken and the joint inventory was prepared. As it has been mentioned that no prayer before the High Court Division for staying its own order so as to move the Appellate Division the order that was passed by this court on 31.10.84 was obtained by suppressing the real fact that by that time possession had been taken after completion of the joint inventory. In this view of the matter there is no hesitation in saying that no contempt had been committed and the petition is therefore dismissed. The order of this court dated 31.10.84 is hereby vacated.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
