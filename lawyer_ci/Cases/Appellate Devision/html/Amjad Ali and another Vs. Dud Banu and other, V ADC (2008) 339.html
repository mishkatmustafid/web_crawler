Tafazzul Islam J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This petition for leave to appeal at the instance of the pre­emptee petitioners is directed against the judgment and order dated 24.7.2006 of the High Court Division passed in Civil Revision No. 4744 of 2000 discharging the rule obtained against the judgment and order dated 17.7.2000 of the learned Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), 2nd Court, Kishoregonj passed in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 61 of 1995 affirming those of dated 25.5.1995 passed by the learned Assistant Judge, Kuliarchar in Pre-emption Miscellaneous Case No.11 of 1994 allowing preemption.<br/> <br/>2. Brief facts are that the Dud Banu, the preemptor respondent No.1, filed the above Miscellaneous Case No.11 of 1994 under section 96 the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act stating <em>inter alia </em> that she is a co-sharer of the case land by inheritance and her sister Nur Banu, the respondent No. 2/co-sharer, sold the case land to the pre-emptee petitioners  by two kabalas dated 4.3.1993 without giving any notice to  her  and  that  she  used  to  live  in Brahmanbaria along with her husband and was not aware of the said transferes and in the first part of Chaitra 1400 B.S., she after coming to her paternal house for the first time found a dwelling hut on the case land and then on query came to know that the preemptee petitioners purchased the case land from Nur Banu by two kabalas.<br/> <br/>3. The preemptee petitioners contested the case by filing joint written statements con­tending that the preemption case is not maintainable as against two sales two application for pre-emption, should have been filed and the pre-emption case is also barred by limitation as the pre-emptor was aware of the said transfers from the very beginning and that the pre-emptee peti­tioners with the consent of the pre-emptor filled up the case land and constructed the dwelling hut therein.<br/> <br/>4. The learned Assistant Judge, after hear­ing, allowed the pre-emption case and on appeal the appellate Court also affirmed the same. The pre-emptee petitioners then moved the High Court Division and obtained Rule in Civil Revision No. 4744 of 2000 and after hearing, the High Court Division discharged the Rule.<br/> <br/>5. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that P.Ws. 2 and 3 and O.P.W.2 in their deposition stated that the pre-emptee petitioners after purchasing the case land filled it up, constructed home­stead and planted trees and lived therein for more than 12 years from the date of their purchase and meanwhile the valua­tion of the case land increased manifold and the High Court Division erroneously held that there is no misreading or non consideration of evidence although it was specifically submitted before the High Court Division that deposition of P.Ws.2 and 3 regarding date of knowledge is con­tradictory and further the High Court Division also did not consider the princi­ples  as laid   down in  the  case  of <strong><em>Mofizuddin Bhuiya vs.  Sree Narayan Chandra Roy and other, 4 MLR (AD) 127.</em></strong><br/> <br/>6. As it appears that High Court Division discharged the Rule holding that the pre-emptor respondent No.1 is a co-sharer of the case land by inheritance and Nur Banu, a co-sharer by inheritance, by two kabalas dated 4.3.1993 sold .08 decimals of land, to each of the pre-emptee petition­ers, who are husband and wife, and thus sold in total 16 decimals of land, and there is no legal bar against filing single appli­cation for pre-emption against two sales and further the pre-emptee petitioners were not co-sharers and no notice of trans­fer of the case land was served upon the pre-emptor respondent No.1 who used to live in her husband's house at Brahmanbaria and after coming to her par­ents house she, seeing a hut raised in the case land, on query for the first time came to know about the purchase of the case land by the pre-emptee petitioners and there is also no evidence on record to show that the pre-emptor respondent No. 1 had earlier knowledge of the transfer and both the Courts below, on proper consider­ation of the evidence on record, concur­rently found that the preemption applica­tion was filed within four months from the date of knowledge of the pre-emptor respondent No.1.<br/> <br/>7. We are of the view that the High Court Division on proper consideration of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision. The learned advocate-on-record also could not point out any illegality or infirmity in the decision of the High Court Division so as to call for any interference.<br/> <br/>8. The petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></span></div></div></div>
