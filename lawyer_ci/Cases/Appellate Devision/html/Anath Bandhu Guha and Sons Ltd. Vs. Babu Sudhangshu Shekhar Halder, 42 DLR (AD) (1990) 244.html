Messers Anath Bandhu Guha and Sons Lim­ited, a Bangladeshi Company having its principal of­fice at Mymensingh, through its constituted attorney Md. Sirajul Huq instituted the aforesaid SSC suit against the defendant-respondent for his eviction from the suit premises at 8, Rankin Street, Wari, Dhaka on the averments, <em>inter alia</em>, that the respondent was not paying rent of the suit premises at the rate of Tk. 150/- per month with effect from June 1971. A notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act was served on him on 23.2.88 requiring him to vacate the suit premises on the last day of March, 1988 which the defendant failed to do.<br/> <br/>3. The suit was filed on 19.4.88. On 23.5.88 the defendant filed an application under Order VII rule 14 and Order XI rule 15 of the Code of Civil Proce­dure for production of the original copy of the power of attorney in the Court, alleging that the power of attorney which was executed in Calcutta. India on 11.9.87 and validated at Dhaka on 16.12.87 was can­celled by the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka by an or­der dated 3.5.88 upon an application of the defendant and after hearing both parties. The SCC Judge direct­ed the plaintiff-appellant to file the original power of attorney in the Court by 15.6.88. The plaintiff-appellant did so on 2.7.88 but took the original copy back on 3.7.88. On 13.8.88 the defendant filed an application for rejection of the plaint under Order III rule 1, Order VI rule 14 and Order VII rule 11 read with section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, submitting that the plaint is liable to be rejected, the validation being cancelled by the proper authority and consequently the plaint not being executed by any lawfully constituted attorney. The plaintiff-appellant filed written objection. The matter was heard on 3.9.88. By order dated 27.9.88 the SCC Judge direct­ed the plaintiff to re-submit the power of attorney by 27.11.88 with proper validation and necessary Ban­gladesh stamps. This time the plaintiff-appellant submitted a validated and stamped power of attorney on 27.12.88. The power of attorney was a fresh one, executed in Calcutta on 2.1.88 and authenticated by a Notary Public, Calcutta on 2.1.88 and validated by the Treasury Officer, Chandpur on 10.12.88. By or­der dated 9.2.89 the SCC Judge rejected the applica­tion of the defendant dated 13.8.88 on the ground [hat the defendant had not mentioned under which of the clauses (a) to (d) of Order VII rule 11 CPC the application was preferred, Section 151 CPC being non-applicable.<br/> <br/>4. The defendant then filed an application on 27.2.89 invoking Order VII rule 11 (a) and (d), CPC in support of his application for reconsideration of the Court's order dated 9.2.89 and for rejection of the plaint. The defendant submitted that the Treasury Of­ficer, Chandpur validated the new power of attorney on 10.12.88 but by Memo. No.1-6/89/1(1) Chow dated 12.1.89 the same Treasury Officer set aside the order of validation dated 10.12.88. Hence the power of attorney has neither been validated nor docs it con­tain Bangladesh stamps as required under section 18 (1) of the Stamp Act. Mr. Sirajul Huq cannot be tak­en to have filed any plaint on behalf of the plaintiff. He cannot legally prosecute the case. The notice un­der section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act is bad. The Advocate appointed by him has no authori­ty to make and do any appearance, applications and acts on behalf of the plaintiff under Order III rule 4 (1) CPC. The plaint has not been signed cither by the party or by his validly-appointed pleader under Order VI rule 14, CPC and hence there is no cause of action for the suit. The plaint is not acceptable and is liable to be rejected under Order VII rule 11 (a) and (d).<br/> <br/>5. By his order dated 25.5.89 the SCC Judge rejected the plaint upon acceptance of the aforesaid submissions of the defendant.<br/> <br/>6. In summarily rejecting the plaintiff-appellant's application under section 25 of the Small Cause Courts Act the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division found that the validation of the power of attorney by the Treasury Officer, Chandpur on 10.12.88 was cancelled by the same Officer on 12.1.89. Hence the power of attorney was not vali­dated and stamped in accordance with law. The plaint of the plaintiff was not maintainable and the filing of the plaint through the attorney and appointment of lawyer by him were also invalid. The attorney Md. Sirajul Huq will have to take adequate steps in an appropriate forum for setting aside the order of can­cellation of validation dated 12.1.89 and obtain a declar­atory decree to that effect. The SCC Court has no juris­diction to give such declaration, the learned Judge held.<br/> <br/>7. Leave was granted to the plaintiff-appellant to consider whether the plaint was rejected upon mis­conception of the facts of the case and the provisions of Order VII rule 11 CPC also to consider whether the plaintiff-appellant has to lake steps in any com­petent forum for setting aside the Treasury Officer's order cancelling validation of the power of attorney and obtain a decree declaring status of the attorney to act under the said power, before the SCC suit can be made maintainable. Leave was also granted to con­sider whether the plaint had been illegally rejected merely because the Treasury had issued a memo pur­portedly cancelling its earlier action on the power under the order of the Court without even examining whether the said memo was valid or void, effective or ineffective, legal or illegal.<br/> <br/>8. Proceeding for the time being on the as­sumption that the power of attorney executed in Cal­cutta on 2.1.88, validated by the Treasury Officer, Chandpur on 10.2.88, and cancelled on 12.1.89 was bad, the moot question in this appeal is, can the plaint be rejected under Order VII rule 11 (a) and (d), CPC? Because of the failure of the power of attor­ney can it be said that the plaint itself has failed, on the ground that the plaint has not been signed, verified and presented by a validly constituted attorney, as has been held by the SCC Judge? Is the view taken correct?<br/> <br/>9. Order III of the Code of Civil Procedure contains the heading 'Recognised agents and plead­ers'. Rule 1 thereof provides that appearances, etc. in any Court may be in person, by recognised agent or by pleader. Rule 2(a) provides that one of such rec­ognised agents may be persons holding powers of at­torney, authorising them to make and do such ap­pearances, etc. Rule 4(1) thereof provides that no pleader shall act for any person in any Court, unless he has been appointed for the purpose by cither the party itself or by his recognised agent or under a power of attorney to make such appointment. Rule 4(2) provides that every such appointment shall be filed in Court and shall be deemed to be in force un­til determined with the leave of the Court or until the client or the pleader dies or until all proceedings in the suit are ended.<br/> <br/>10. When the Court finds that the power of at­torney is bad, the only order that the Court can pass is under Order III rule 4(1). The Court shall debar the pleader to act for the party in the Court, for the simple reason that he has not been appointed for the purpose by or under a valid power of attorney and has, therefore, no authority to act on behalf of the party in the court. In other words, the mischief of Order III rule 4(1), which debars a lawyer to act for any person in any Court unless he has been appoint­ed, among others, by a duly constituted attorney, will fall upon the lawyer, not upon the plaint. When the power of attorney fails the embargo that follows will fall upon the lawyer, not upon the prosecution of the suit by the principal. The disability attaches to the lawyer not to the plaint. The Court will next set a date for steps to be taken by the plaintiff and on the next dale several options are open to the plaintiff. He may appear in person or by another recognised agent or by the same recognised agent (power of attorney) af­ter removing the objections that have been taken with regard to the validity of the power of attorney.<br/> <br/>11. It was manifestly wrong for the SCC Judge to hold that because of the failure of the power of attorney there was no cause of action for the suit, for the attorney himself has no cause of action for the suit. It is the principal who has the cause of action for the suit. In the cause title and in paragraph 1 of the plaint it has been made abundantly clear that it is the plaintiff-Company which has filed the suit through its constituted attorney Md. Sirajul Huq. The plaint can be rejected only when on the aver­ments of the plaint the plaintiff-Company itself is found not lo have any cause of action against the defendant, not the attorney.<br/> <br/>12. Without rejecting the plaint the Court has thus a clear duty to fix a date for taking next steps by the plaintiff. If the plaintiff appears on the next date either in person or by a new recognised agent or by the same recognised agent after removing the defects in the power of attorney, the suit will proceed, if it is otherwise in order.<br/> <br/>13. As far as the signature on the plaint is concerned, Order III rules 1 and 2 clearly provide that any appearance, application or act in or to any Court may be made, amongst others, by a recognised agent and the holder of a power of attorney is a recognised agent. Order III rules 1 and 2 have no application in the mailer of signature on the plaint because it is not an act in or to a Court. A plaint can be signed outside the Court.<br/> <br/>14. The plaintiff is a Bangladeshi Company and with regard to Companies, the provision of sign­ing and verifying a plaint is contained in Order XXIX rule 1 CPC as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"In suits by or against a Corporation, any pleading may be signed and verified on behalf of the Corporation by the Secretary or by any direc­tor or other principal officer of the Corporation who is able to depose to the facts of the case."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Md. Sirajul Huq has not claimed himself to be cither the Secretary, or a director or a principal offi­cer of the plaintiff-Company and so his signature on the plaint is not covered by the provisions of Order XXIX rule 1. Companies, however, are not exclu­sively governed by the provisions of Order XXIX rule 1 in the matter of signature on the plaint. They are also governed by the provisions of Order VI rule 14 of the Code which are as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Every pleading shall be signed by the party and his pleader (if any): Provided that where a par­ty pleading is, by reason of absence or for other good cause, unable to sign the pleading, it may be signed by any person duly authorised by him to sign the same or to sue or defend on his behalf."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>15. The choice of a Company is in the alterna­tive. It can cither follow Order XXIX rule 1 or Order VI rule 14. There is ample authority for the view that "any person duly authorised" by a Company to sign the plaint is not restricted to holders of power of attorney, as for example, the case of <em><strong>Bengal Jute Mills Vs. Jecoraj Hiralal, AIR 1943 (Cal) 13.</strong></em> A Company, however, cannot orally authorize a person to sign a plaint. It is governed by its Articles of As­sociation in such matters. If the power of attorney of Md. Sirajul Huq fails and if he takes up the plea that he was otherwise "duly authorised" in terms of the Articles of Association of the Company to sign the plaint then this is a matter of evidence. It is absolutely premature to hold at this stage that the plaint was not signed by a duly authorised person.<br/> <br/>16. As regards verification of the plaint by Md. Sirajul Huq, whose power of attorney was found to be invalid, it does not seem to be covered by the provisions of Order XXIX rule 1, but a Company can also similarly take shelter behind Order VI rule 15, CPC which provides that every pleading shall be verified at the foot by the party or by one of the par­ties pleading or by some other persons proved to the satisfaction of the Court to be acquainted with the facts of the case. It is not a necessary condition of verification that it should be done by the holder of a power of attorney. If Md. Sirajul Huq, independent of the power of attorney, had acquaintance with the facts of the case he could verify the plaint and if it is the defendant's case that he was not so acquainted then the matter can be resolved only by evidence.<br/> <br/>17. With regard to the presentation of the plaint Order IV rule 1 CPC provides that every suit shall be instituted by presenting a plaint to the Court or such officer as it appoints in this behalf. It does not specifically say or pin-point as to who shall present the plaint. The plaint need not be presented by the plaintiff personally or by a person duly au­thorised by him. It has been held in the case of <em><strong>Wali Md. V. Iskak Ali (</strong></em>judgment by Acting <strong>CJ Sulaiman</strong><em><strong>) AIR 1931 (All) 507 (SB) </strong></em>that it is doubtful whether Order III rule 1 CPC would apply to presen­tation of a plaint. There is no rule expressly requir­ing the plaintiff to present the plaint personally or by a person holding a power of attorney on his be­half or otherwise duly authorised by him.<br/> <br/>18. In any view of the matter if a plaint is not properly signed or verified or presented the Court has always got the discretion to allow the plaintiff to remedy the defect at a later stage, on the view that the defects are of technical nature relating to matters of procedure curable at any time.<br/> <br/>19. Order VII rule 11 is not at all attracted when there are defects or irregularities in complying with the provisions of Order III or Order VI CPC. In this connection reference may be made to the case of <em><strong>All India Reporter Limited, Bombay Vs. Ramchandra Dhondo Dater, AIR 1961 (Bom) 292</strong></em> wherein it has been observed as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"In this case it is necessary to note that Or­der VII rule 11 which refers to the rejection of a plaint, enumerates only four cases in which a plaint has to be rejected, but it does not enumer­ate any of the defects or irregularities referred to in Order VI rule 14, Order VI rule 15, or Order VI rule 2. It is clear from the provisions con­tained in Order VI that these Rules relate only to procedure, and the better view would be to regard them as mere matters of procedure and to hold that if a plaint is not properly signed or verified but is admitted and entered in the register of suits, it does not cease to be a plaint and the suit cannot be said not to have been instituted merely because of the existence of some defects or irregularities in the matter of signing and ver­ification of the plaint."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The decision cited above then refers to a number of decisions in support of the above view which also commends to us.<br/> <br/>20. We, therefore, hold that even taking the hypothetical view that the power of attorney was bad the mischief of the provisions of Order VII rule 11 (a) or (d) CPC is not attracted and the proper course for the learned SCC Judge was to set a next date for the plaintiff to take steps. We, however, wish to make it clear that the defendant is free to raise the is­sue as to whether the plaint was properly signed, verified and presented or not and the trial Court will decide the issue, if raised, in the light of what we have held above.<br/> <br/>21. Both sides have made elaborate arguments as to the legality or otherwise of the orders dated 10.12.88 and 12.1.89 validating and then cancelling the validation of the power of attorney. Then learned Counsel for the respondent Mr. Asrarul Hossain has argued that the validation of the power of attorney on 10.12.88 was itself illegal and in any case it was cancelled subsequently on 12.1.89. So there is no power of attorney. Mr. Moinul Huq, learned Coun­sel for the appellant, has argued, on the other hand, that the validation was made under section 35 of the Stamp Act read with section 18 thereof in pursuance of an unchallenged valid order of the SCC Judge dat­ed 27.9.88 and thereafter the cancellation was illegal.<br/> <br/>22. We shall not express ourselves on the question as to whether the validation dated 10.12.88 was illegal or not or as to whether the subsequent cancellation dated 12.1.89 was valid or not, because we find that the SCC Judge has not at all applied his mind to the various contentions raised. If so advised the parties may raise the issue once again at the appro­priate lime before the SCC Judge who will take note of all the submissions and give his decision on them.<br/> <br/>23. We shall, however, express ourselves on some limited matters so that the parties are not plagued by these controversies any more. Central to the dispute is the provision of section 18 of the Stamp Act which is as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"> <br/>"<strong>18. Instruments other than bills, and notes executed out of Bangladesh.—</strong> (1) Every instrument chargeable with duly and executed only out of Bangladesh and not being a bill of exchange, or promissory note, may be stamped within three months after it has been first received in Bangladesh.<br/>(2) Where any such instrument cannot, with reference to the description of stamp prescribed therefor, be duly stamped by a private person, it may be taken within the said period of three months to the Collector, who shall stamp the same, in such manner as the Government may by rule prescribe, with a stamp of such val­ue as the person so taking such instrument may require and pay for."<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">24. Mr. Asrarul Hossain submits that the power of attorney was validated by the Treasury Offi­cer, Chandpur on 10.12.88 more than 5 months after it was first produced in the Court on 2.7.88 which will be taken to be the dale of its first arrival in Ban­gladesh. Validation after a period of three months will render the act of validation illegal and in support of the proposition the case of <em><strong>Ali Mohammad Vs. Jagannath Prasad, AIR 1928 (All) 66</strong></em> has been cited. In this case an acknowledgement was executed in Gwalior State and stamped with a one anna Gwalior stamp, but it was not stamped in British India with­in three months of its first arrival. It was held that the account book produced in British India subse­quently was not admissible in evidence as the ac­knowledgment was not stamped till more than three months afterwards which is the time limit set by section 18 of the Stamp Act.<br/> <br/>25. In the cited case the acknowledgement was not admitted in evidence, because the Court could not impose any penalty due to the fact that the instrument was chargeable with a duty of one anna only.<br/> <br/>26. The better view seems to be that if an in­strument executed abroad is not stamped by the Treasury within three months after it has been first received in Bangladesh it can still be stamped after three months, but that will be done in breach of sec­tion 18 and thereby the penal provision of section 35 will be attracted. The relevant portion of section 35 of the Stamp Act is as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"<strong>35. Instruments not duly stamped inadmis­sible in evidence, etc.— </strong>No instrument chargeable with duty shall be admitted in evidence for any purpose by any person having by law or consent of parties authority to receive evidence, or shall be acted upon, registered or authenticat­ed by any such person or by any public officer, unless such instrument is duly stamped:<br/>Provided that —<br/>(a) any such instrument not being an instru­ment chargeable with a duly of ten paisa or five paisa only, or a bill of exchange or promissory note, shall, subject to all just exceptions, be ad-milled in evidence on payment of the duty with which the same is chargeable, or, in the case of an instrument insufficiently stamped, of the amount required to make up such duty, together with a penalty of five Taka, or, when ten times the amount of the proper duly or deficient por­tion thereof exceeds five Taka, or a sum equal to ten limes such duty or portion;<br/>(b)............................................................<br/>(c).............................................................<br/>(d).............................................................<br/>(c)............................................................</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>27. The words "duly stamped" occurring in section 35, have been defined in section 2 (11) of the Stamp Act as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"(11) "Duly Stamped”: 'duly stamped' as applied to an instrument, means that the instrument bears an adhesive or impressed stamp of not less than the proper amount, and that such stamp has been affixed or used in accordance with the law for the time being in force in Bangladesh."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>28. When the SCC Judge examined the plain­tiffs power of attorney on 27.9.88 and ordered refilling on validation, he will be deemed to have found not only the defect of absence of Bangladesh stamps in the power of attorney but also the breach of sec­tion 18 in not stamping the same within the time limit given in that section. Both the breaches will be cured on payment of duly and penalty and validation under section 35.<br/> <br/>29. In the case of <em><strong>The Punjab National Bank Ltd. Vs. Messrs. Dewan and Co. and others, 7 DLK (WP) 65</strong></em>, <em><strong>BZ Kaikus, J.,</strong></em> as his Lordship then was, observed very correctly:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Assuming that this document had not been stamped within three months, what would be the result? The only result would be that it would not be a duly stamped document. The definition of duly stamped document is given in section 2(11) of the Stamp Act.....................<br/><br/>The words "duly stamped" have reference not only to the amount of stamp but also to the other requirements of law. If a document is not stamped at the time al which the law requires it to be stamped, the only result would be that it would not be duly stamped. For instance, if a pronote executed in Pakistan is stamped not at the time of its execution but afterwards, it will be a document not duly stamped and would be hit by section 35. It would be obvious that a document stamped in violation of section 18 cannot be placed on a lower footing than a docu­ment not stamped at all. Suppose there was no stamp on the power of attorney. All that could have happened was that duly and penalty would have been charged. The only objection, therefore, to the document was that it was not duly stamped and for that reason could not be admitted in evi­dence. If a document be not duly stamped under section 35 it will become admissible, except to certain specified cases with which we are not con­cerned, on payment of duty and penalty."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>30. We would conclude this issue and say that the power of attorney was validated on 10.12.88 in pursuance of the SCC Judge's order dated 27.9.88. That order dated 27.9.88, if executed, will cure me power of attorney not only of the defect that it con­tains no Bangladesh stamps but also of the breach of section 18 in that the time limit was not observed. The holder of the power of attorney, however, must pay the prescribed penalty, or else the power of attorney will still be inadmissible in evidence.<br/> <br/>31. It has been submitted by the learned Coun­sel for the respondent that the Treasury Officer, Chandpur was without jurisdiction in validating the power of attorney under section 18 of the Stamp Act. Under sub-rule (2) of Rule 12 of The Stamp Rules read with section 18 of the Stamp Act, it is the duty of the "proper officer" as defined in Rule 9 of the Stamp Rules to stamp the instrument in the manner as described by Rule 11 of the said Rules "Proper Officers" within the meaning of Rule 9 are specified in the Appendix A to the Rules and it is “asserted that the Treasury Officer, Chandpur has not been made a "proper officer" within the meaning of the said Rules. The learned Counsel for the plaintiff-appellant submits, on the other hand, that the list given in the Appendix is not exhaustive and in any view of the mailer the Treasury Officer, Chandpur could not have acted without jurisdiction in affixing stamp under section 18 of the Stamp Act.<br/> <br/>32. Mr. Moinul Huq contended that the Treasu­ry Officer was <em>functus officio</em> after having validated the power of attorney on 10.12.88. He has no juris­diction to subsequently set aside the order of valida­tion. The defendant, if aggrieved by the order of vali­dation, could pursue the remedies provided in the Stamp Act and The Rules.<br/> <br/>33. Mr. Moinul Huq also submits that the rea­sons given by the Treasury Officer, Chandpur by his memo dated 12.1.89 cancelling the validation have not been touched upon by the learned SCC Judge. The SCC Judge did not examine whether the said memo was valid or void, effective or ineffective, le­gal or illegal.<br/> <br/>34. Mr. Asrarul Hossain supports, on the other hand, judgment of the High Court Division and argues that the SCC Court has no jurisdiction to de­cide the question relating to the validity of the action of the Treasury Officer in cancelling the validation of power of attorney in terms of section 15 of the Small Cause Courts Act read with Article 3 of The Second Schedule thereto. The attorney has to obtain a declaratory decree determining his status, he submits.<br/> <br/>35. We have no hesitation in holding that the learned Judge of the High Court Division fell into an error of law in holding that the SCC Judge had no jurisdiction to decide the validity of the order of cancellation of the validation of the power of attorney. Whether the order dated 12.1.89 was valid and legal and whether the reasons given for cancellation are le­gally valid or not, are questions germane to the subject matter under controversy. This is not a matter extraneous to the suit nor a matter foreign to the subject matter under controversy. The learned SCC exercise a jurisdiction which was lawfully vested in him and the learned Judge of the High Court Division also took an erroneous view in the matter.<br/> <br/>36. The above questions and issues, except those which have already been decided by us, may now be decided afresh by the learned SCC Judge if the par­ties still prefer to raise the same. The order of rejection of plaint, for the reasons stated, obviously suffers from an error of law and it is accordingly set aside.<br/> <br/>In the result, the appeal is allowed without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
