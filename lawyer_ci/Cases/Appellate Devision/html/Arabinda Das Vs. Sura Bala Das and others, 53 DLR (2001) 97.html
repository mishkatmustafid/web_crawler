The decision proposed to be given in this Rule does not call for any detailed recounting of facts except that predecessor of the opposite party Nos. 1 and 2 as plaintiffs laid a suit being Title Suit No. 199 of 1960 in the Second Court of Munsif, Brahmanbaria for a decree of partition with respect to schedule ‘Ka’ and ‘Kha’ properties detailed in the plaint. The defendant Nos. 4 to 6 and 8-9 resisted the suit by presenting two separate written statements traversing all the material allegations made in the plaint. The suit was decreed in preliminary form on 27-09-1961 on contest against the defendants. An appeal being Title Appeal No. 302 of 1961 had been carried by the defendants but without any success. The appeal was dismissed. The appellate decree was also challenged before the High Court Division in a Second Appeal and the preliminary decree recorded by the trial Court was maintained. Proceeding for drawing up a final decree commenced. For effecting final decree an Advocate Commissioner was appointed. Report had been submitted by the learned Advocate Commissioner but the said report stood rejected on the basis of a written objection preferred against the Report by an order dated 24-06-1977. The defendant No. 5 on 18-05-1978 presented an application for recording an order of abatement taking the stand that defendant No. 10 died 9 years ago. Thereafter, the decree-holder plaintiffs filed an application on 23-08-1978 for substitution of the heirs of deceased-defendant No. 10. The learned Munsif by his order dated 04-03-1981 recorded an order of abatement. The decree-holder plaintiffs, thereafter, filed an application under the provision of rule 9 of Order 22 of the Code of Civil Procedure for setting aside the said order recording abatement.<br/> <br/>The learned Munsif by his order dismissed the Miscellaneous Case. In recording dismissal he took the view that the application had not been properly framed inasmuch as description of the parties as required under the provision of Code of Civil Procedure had not been given. The plaintiffs felt aggrieved by the above decision and sought setting aside the same through a medium of appeal being Miscellaneous Appeal No. 14 of 1984 before the Court of District Judge, Brahmanbaria. The learned Additional District Judge, First Court, Brahmanbaria heard the appeal and by his judgment and order dated 31-01-1991 allowed the appeal, set aside the order dated 19-11-1981 recording abatement in Miscellaneous Case No. 96 of 1981 and allowed the petition preferred by the plaintiffs under the provision of Order 22 rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The learned appellate Judge also brought on record the legal heirs of the deceased-defendant No. 10 and directed the suit to be proceeded with.<br/> <br/>3. Feeling aggrieved of the above adjudication, the defendant No. 4 (Ka) as petitioner approached this Court in an application under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained the present Rule.<br/> <br/>4. By the preliminary decree the rights and extent of shares of the parties are determined and final decree will be drawn up on the basis of preliminary decree. Admittedly, the defendant No. 10 died after drawing up preliminary decree in favour of the decree-holder plaintiffs. Law is well settled that after recording and drawing up a preliminary decree in a suit for partition, there will be no abatement on the death of a defendant and the legal heirs of the deceased-defendant can be brought on record at any time for effecting proper allotment of shares. For substitution of heirs there is limitation. The lower appellate Court duly considered this legal aspect of the matter and recorded a reasoned and well-founded decision. The reasonings and the conclusion reached by the lower appellate Court does not at all suffer from any patent illegality, legal infirmity and flagrant error of law warranting any interference by this Court in the exercise of revisional authority under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/> <br/>5. The entire body of procedural law is meant for advancement of the cause of justice and not to pose any technical difficulty in the way of the Court to do complete justice between the litigant parties for the administration of which alone it had been created. All technicalities are required to be avoided to secure justice as because end of law is justice. From a reading of the order recorded by the learned Munsif (now Assistant Judge) dismissing the miscellaneous Case under rule 9 of Order 22 of the Code of Civil Procedure it appeared that just on a technical point learned Munsif dismissed the miscellaneous Case.<br/> <br/>6. Before parting with the matter I feel inclined to record an observation that the partition suit is of the year 1960 and as such justice demands that the same may be disposed of as immediately as possible and a direction is accorded to the Court below accordingly.<br/> <br/>7. On conspectus, the inevitable conclusion that flows is that the Rule is absolutely without any substance and the same must be discharged. The Rule is accordingly, discharged, however, without any order as to cost. The judgment and order recorded by the learned Additional District Judge, First Court, Brahmanbaria in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 14 of 1984 is maintained. The learned Assistant Judge (former Munsif), Brahmanbaria is directed to dispose of Partition Suit No. 199 of 1960 within 6(six) months positively on the receipt of this judgment and order.<br/> <br/>The order of stay granted at the time of issuance of the Rule stands vacated.<br/> <br/>Communicate the order to the Court below at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
