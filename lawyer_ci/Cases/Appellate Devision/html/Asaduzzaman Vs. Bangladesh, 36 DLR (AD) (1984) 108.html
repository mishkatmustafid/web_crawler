Plaintiff who is the appellant instituted Title Suit No. 101 of 1973 in the 4th Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka for specific performance of contract. His case is that he entered into an agreement on October 14, 1971 with Abdus Sattar Solaiman, who is the sole owner of the disputed property to sell it to him at a consideration of Tk. 1,00,000/-. On payment of Tk. 75,000/- as advance, possession of the premises was given to the appellant. It was agreed that the seller would execute and register a deed of sale within one year on receipt of the balance of the conside­ration. On his failure to execute and register the said deed as agreed upon between them the appellant filed the suit for enforcement of the contract.<br/> <br/>3. Respondent was impleaded as defen­dant No. 2 as required by the provisions of President's Order No. 142 of 1972. In his written statement filed on March 19, 1975 Abdus Sattar Solaiman was admitted as owner of the disputed property but the agreement for sale was challenged as being false and fabricated. Further, the disputed property being an abandoned property, an order of allotment was made in respect of the first floor of the premises. The allot­ment was made in favour of one Dr. Giasuddin Ahmed on December 13, 1973. By their Memo No. 2p-4-240/73 dated 12.5.75 the Government cancelled the order of allotment on the representation by the appellant that he was in possession of the disputed property in pursuance of the agreement for sale as mentio­ned above. Possession of the property was never taken over by the Government. After the promulgation of Martial Law Regulation No. VII of 1977 the lear­ned Subordinate Judge passed the order of abatement of the suit suo motu on November 24, 1977. An application for review of this order filed by the appellant was rejected on February 14, 1978. Against these orders the appellant moved the High Court Division which by its afore-mentioned order in the civil revision case upheld the order of abatement passed by the learned Subordinate Judge. On No­vember 18, 1982, the appellant obtained leave of this Court to consider whether the order of abatement was rightly recorded in the absence of an assertion by the Go­vernment that it has taken possession of the property in question.                              <br/> <br/>4. Mr. Khondker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, Counsel for the appellant contended, that the provision for abatement of suits etc. in Martial Law Regulation No. VII of 1977 were not applicable to the plaintiff-appel­lant's suit for specific performance of contract as the contract was entered into before President's Order No. 16 of 1972 came into force and as also the property in question was not taken over by Government.<br/> <br/>5. It appears that the contract sale of the property in question was entered on October 14, 1971, and the suit for enfor­cement of the contract was filed on October 4, 1973. The allotment of the property in question was made by the Government on December 13, 1973 but it appears to have been cancelled on May 12, 1975. Acc­ording to Mr. Ahmed, Counsel for the appel­lant, the Government did not comply with the provisions of the President's Order No. 16 of 1972 before treating the property in question as abandoned property prior to making the order of allotment. Even then, the order of allotment made by the Govern­ment on December 13, 1973 was can­celled by the Government itself. On May 12, 1975 as mentioned above, no applic­ation for abatement of the suit was filed in Court. His contention is that there are no provisions in the aforesaid President's Order barring the enforcement of a contract for sale of property which was entered into before the coming into force of the Order, though the properly in question, he conceded, may have become an abandoned property when the Order was promulgated. In this connection his further contention is that the Government does not appear to have exer­cised its authority under the provisions of Article 10 of the aforesaid Order before the order of cancellation of the contract for sale was passed by the   Government. In such circumstances, the trial court acting suo motu has no power to pass the impugned order.<br/> <br/>6. The learned Counsel also contended that the plaintiff-appellant did not challenge the vesting of the property in question as abandoned property so as to attract the pro­visions of Martial Law Regulation No. VII of 1977. Its provisions had no application also for the reason that the possession of the property was never taken by the Government.<br/> <br/>7. Moreover, there are no provisions of law for determination by any Court of law as to the status of a property in respect of which there has been a contract for sale before President’s Order No. 16 of 1972 came into force. According to him, there is a distinction between such property and any property which is subject to contract for sale after the aforesaid Order came into force. In any case there is no point, legal or otherwise, in passing the order of abate­ment of the suit suo motu when the Govern­ment itself cancelled the order of allotment of the first floor of the premises in question on the representation of the plaintiff-appellant and he has remained in possession of the property in part performance of the contract for its sale.<br/> <br/>8. It appears from the judgment of the High Court Division that the only ground upon which it discharged the Rule is that the property in question is, in the opinion of the learned Judges, an abandoned properly. The only other point mentioned in the impugned judgment is that "in the written statement the Government challenged the agreement of the plaintiff and asserted that the disputed property was abandoned property". The learned Judges, therefore, came to the con­clusion that "the claim of enforcement of the alleged contract by itself considered inherent challenge as to the character of the abando­ned property and Martial Law Regulation No. VII of 1977 is attracted". Apparently, no elaborate or specifically pointed argument was advanced by the plain­tiff's Advocate before the learned Judges of the High Court Division, as has been done by Mr. Ahmed in this Court.<br/> <br/>9. In the course of submissions before us, the learned Counsel referred to the pro­visions of Article 10 of the Abandoned Pro­perty (Control, Management and Disposal) Order, 1972 (P.O. No. 16 of 1972) which, as it appears, does not provide any bar against the enforcement of a contract for sale of any property (entered into before the aforesaid Order came into force) unless the Government exercised its authority under Article 10. The provisions of Article 10 are as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“10. (1) The Government may cancel any allotment or terminate any lease or amend the terms of lease or agreement under which any abandoned property is held, occupied or managed by a per­son, where such allotment, lease or agreement has been granted or entered into after the 25th day of March, 1971.<br/>(2) Where by reason of any action taken under clause (1) any person has ceased to be entitled to possession of any abandoned property he shall, on demand by the Government surrender possession of such property to the Go­vernment or to any person   authorised by it in this behalf.<br/>(3) If any person fails to surrender possession of any property on demand under clause (2), the Government may eject such person and take possession of such property in such manner as may be prescribed."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>10. He submitted that the Government has not yet, in exercise of its power under the aforesaid provisions, cancelled the agree­ment or contract for sale of the property in question. Had it done so the position might have been different. If, therefore, the contract of sale exists, both in fact and in the eye of law, can its enforceability be resisted on the ground that the property in question has become an abandoned property? Accor­ding to him, such argument, if made by the Government without taking resort to the provisions of Article 10, would be untenable. His contention being substantial must be conceded. Before the suit was filed by the appellant for specific performance of the contract, the Government should have exer­cised its direction and cancelled the contract, but as the facts stated above show that the Government failed to taken action prior to the filing of the suit, it missed the oppor­tunity to resist the appellant's claim to enforce the contract. Not only the Govern­ment failed to exercise its authority under Article 10 and did not cancel the contract, it did not even plead or establish to have exercised such authority. It is a well-known principle of law that a legal right unless its enforcement is barred under the provisions of law is always enforceable in a Court of law. Also, the right of access to a Court of law is well recognised.<br/> <br/>11. So far as the provisions of Martial Law Regulation No. VII of 1977 are concern­ed, they appear to prevent such access to the Court, and this is apparent from the following provisions of the Regulation:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"<strong>4. Vesting of abandoned property</strong> <strong>—</strong> Where before the commencement of this Regulation, any property, or the possession, control, management, ad­ministration or other rights of, or in respect of, any property, has been or is purported to have been, taken over under the Acting President's Order or as abandoned property under or in pursuance of the President's Order by, or under the authority or at the instance of, the Government, such property shall, notwithstanding any defect in the right or authority to take it over, vest, and be deemed always to have vested, in the Government.<br/> <br/><strong>5. Taking over, etc. of abandoned property not to be challenged, etc —</strong> (1) Save as provided in, the President's Order, no such taking over or vesting of property as is referred to in paragraph 4 shall be called in question on any ground whatsoever before any authority or in any Court; nor shall any such taking over or vesting of property give rise to any claim to compensation.<br/>(2) All suits, appeals, petitions, applica­tions and other legal proceedings pend­ing immediately before the commence­ment of this Regulation in any Court in which any such taking over or vesting of property as is referred to in para­graph 4 has been called in question in any manner whatsoever shall abate forthwith and shall not be further proceeded with."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>12. The learned Counsel for the appel­lant submitted that in the suit for specific performance of contract, the appellant did not raise any challenge to the taking over or vesting of property as mentioned in Article 4. There is even no implied challenge to such taking over or vesting. He also mentioned that there is no paper to show that the property in question was taken over by the Government since the same has all along been in possession of the appellant. Even the allotment made by the Government in favour of one Dr. Giasuddin after the institution of the suit for specific performance of contract was cancelled by the Government on the basis of the appellant's representation before it. Moreover, the Government has invoked the provisions of Article 5(2) of Martial Law Regulation No. VII of 1977 and applied to the Court for recording abate­ment of the suit thereunder. Right to pro­perty is as important a right as right to life and liberty of a person, and not only laws extend protection to such right, even the Constitution has, subject to certain qualifications or restrictions which can be imposed in the public interest or for public purpose recognised such right. Such right will no longer remain a right unless, when threatened or invaded by one who has no claim thereto, it can be protected in the Court of law. Right to specific performance of contract for sale of any property is a right relating to property. It must, therefore, receive protection in the absence of any provisions of law to the contrary. There are no such provisions of law.<br/> <br/>13. In this connection it also requires mentioning that when the facts of the ins­tant case involved consideration of the pro­visions of two different laws, namely, President's Order No. 16 of 1972 and Mar­tial Law Regulation no. VII of 1977 the Court in according suo motu order of abate­ment, seems to have proceeded perfuncto­rily as well as arbitrarily. Appellant's Coun­sel referred to a few decisions of this Court reported in <em>31 DLR (AD) 266</em>, <em>32 DLR (AD) 260 </em>and <em>34 DLR (AD) 25</em>. As these decisions have no direct relation to the points invol­ved in the present appeal, they do not require any consideration.<br/> <br/>For the reasons stated above, the appeal is allowed. The order of abatement is vaca­ted and the suit will now proceed in accor­dance with law. There will be no order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
