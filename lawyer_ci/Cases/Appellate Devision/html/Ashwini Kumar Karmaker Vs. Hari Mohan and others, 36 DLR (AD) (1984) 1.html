The question is whether the question of benami transaction can be gone into and determined in a proceeding for pre-emption under section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950. In both the cases, learn­ed respective Judges of the Single Bench of the High Court Division answered the ques­tion in the negative and allowed the pre-emp­tion sought for. Consequently, pre-emptees are the appellants before us.<br/> <br/>2. Civil Appeal No. 103 of 1982 arises from Civil Revision No. 1147 of 1980 which, is its turn, originated, from Misc. Case No. 72 of 1973 of the Court of Munsif, Noakhali. Respondent No. 1 claimed in that case pre-­emption of the transfer made under a regis­tered kabala dated 22 December, 1972 alleg­ing that the vender-respondent No. 2 sold the land to the appellant, a stranger, without serving any notice upon him although he was his co-sharer in the holding by inheritance. The appellant contested the Pre-emption case alleging that no transfer took place under the said kabala (Ext. 1) but this  kabala was executed only to clear his title in the land which he had purchased in the benami of his nephew, respondent No. 2, under a pre­vious kabala dated 24 October 1970 (Ext. 2) from respondent No. 6. The trial court rejected the claim of "benami" under the previous kabala holding that the question could not be entertained in a pre-emption case and taking subsequent kabala as one effecting actual transfer of the land, allowed the pre-emption. The lower Appellate Court however held that the question of benami could be determined in a pre-emption case and dismissed the application for pre-emption after reversing the trial Court’s order. A learned Single Judge of the High Court Division interfered, in revision, with the Order of the Subordinate Judge, and restored the trial Court's Order.<br/> <br/>3. Miah Abdul Gafur, learned Advocate for the appellant, contends that the view taken by the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division is not correct and argues that the question of benami nature of a transaction falls within the scope of an enquiry under section 96. In support of this contention he has relied upon a decision of the Calcutta High Court reported in <strong><em>Balai Chand Mondal Vs Nivaran Chandra Das, 51, CWN, 644</em></strong><em>.</em> We have perused the judgment in the case, but find that it is not helpful to the instant case There, the vendor himself resisted the application for pre-emption taking the ground that he did not transfer the land to the ostensible purchaser, his nephew, but he simply executed the kabala without consideration in favour of his nephew making a "show of transfer in order to put away his creditors". The court found that no actual transfer took place under the kabala sought to be pre-empted and that the vendor remained all along in possession of the land and as such the question of pre­-emption could not arise. This colourable transaction was referred to as a benami tran­saction in the Pre-emption case and it is in such a case of benami where no actual trans­fer took place that the question of benami nature of transaction could be considered in a proceeding for pre-emption under section 26F of the Bengal Tenancy Act. In the instant case, facts are altogether different. Here we find two kabalas in respect of the same land. The earlier one shows transfer of the land from respondent No. 6 to respondent No. 2. This Kabala was not sought to be pre-emp­ted. The kabala sought to be pre-empted in the later one, which shows that res­pondent No. 2 transferred the land to the appellant, Respondent No. 1 Pre-emptor is a co-sharer of respondent No. 2 by inheritance, and as such, he got right to pre-empt the land. In the proceeding for pre-emption the Court is not required to entertain the question whether the respondent No. 2 the vendor was benamdar of the appellant in the previous transaction. Pre­-emption is found to have been rightly allowed to respondent No. 1. The appeal is liable to be dismissed<br/> <br/>4. Civil Appeal No. 123 of 1982 arises from an order of a Single Judge of the High Court Division passed in Civil Revision No. 278 of 1981 which originated from Misc. Case No. 206 of 1977 of the Court of Munsiff, Faridpur. It was filed by respondent No. 1 claiming pre-emption of a land transferred under a registered sale-deed dated 10 June 1975. The land was transferred by respondent No. 2 to 6 to the appellant (pre-emptee) who was a stranger. Respondent No. 1 is a co-sharer of the vendor by inheritance but he was not served with notice of the transfer. The appellant resisted the pre-emption taking the ground that he was not the real purchaser, but three other persons, namely. Kalam, Kabir and Jahangir are the real purchasers and he is merely their benamdar; but as the real purchasers were not made parties to the proceeding, it is not maintainable. In this case also the trial court held that the question of benami could not be gone into in a pre­emption case, but the lower Appellate Court, namely, the Subordinate Judge took the contrary view that such a question could be determined in a pre-emption case and, on reversing the trial court's order granting pre-­emption, ordered that the case should be remanded to the trial court for disposal according to law. This order of the Subor­dinate Judge in appeal was challenged by a revisional application (C.R. No. 4 of 1980) under section 115(2) of the Civil Proce­dure Code before the District Judge. The learned Additional District Judge, who heard the matter, allowed the revisional application, set aside the order of the Subordinate Judge and restored that of the trial Court allowing pre-emption. The pre-emptee moved a second revision namely, C.R. No. 278 of 1981 before the High Court Division under section 115(3) C.P.C. challeng­ing the Additional District Judge's order. But at the out-set lawyers of both the parties made a common submission before the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division conceding that the Additional District Judge had no jurisdiction to entertain the revisional application against the Subordinate Judge's order in appeal. On their submission the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division set aside the order of the Additional District Judge as if no legal proceeding were taken in revision before the District Judge, and then suo motu proceeded to revise the Subordinate Judge's order treating the second revisional application as one filed under section 115(1) instead of section 115(3) of the Civil Procedure Code Therefore, the learned Single Judge considered the matter on merit and accepted the view taken by the trial court that the question of benami transaction could not be gone into in a proceeding for pre-emption. The learned Single Judge having found no more necessity for remand of the case set aside the Subordi­nate Judge's order and restored that of the trial court allowing pre-emption.<br/> <br/>5. In this appeal we need not pass any opinion whether the revisional application was heard by the Additional District Judge without having jurisdiction, but we may observe that jurisdiction of Courts is created by statutes and that it can neither be conferr­ed nor taken away by agreement or concession of parties to litigation or of their lawyers. Mr. Asraful Hossain, learned Advocate for the appellant, has assailed the judgment of the lear­ned Single Judge on two grounds. One is that the view taken by the learned Single Judge that the question of benami cannot be decided in a pre-emption proceeding is erro­neous, and the other is that when the order of the Additional District Judge in first revision was set aside, the proper course left for the High Court Division was to maintain the Subordinate Judge's order of remand as to the first contention. Mr. Hossain has relied upon two decisions, one in the case of <strong><em>Balai Chand Mondal Vs. Nivaran Chandra Das, 51, CWN 644</em></strong> as already discussed above and the other in the case of <strong><em>Barkat Ali Mondal Vs. Masem Ali Biswas, 6 DLR 589</em></strong> The learned Single Judge also considered these two decisions along with a decision reported in the case of <strong><em>Singhuram Panja Vs Ambica Charan Shantra, 45 CWN, 658</em></strong> and held that the view taken in the last mentioned case is the correct view, that is, the question of benami cannot be gone into in a summary proceeding under section 96 of the State Ac­quisition and Tenancy Act. The facts of the cases of <strong><em>6 DLR &amp; 51 CWN</em></strong> are altogether differ rent from that of the instant case Details of these cases are not necessary for elaboration in ibis appeal as we have already found above that the question of benami nature of kabala on the basis of which pre-emption is claimed can not be gone into and determined in proceeding for pre-emption But if a pre-emption is sought to be resisted on the ground that no transfer took place under the relevant kabala in that vendor did not part with his possession but simply made a show of transfer for any purpose such as to put away his creditors, as in the case reported in <strong><em>51 CWN 644</em></strong>, then such a transaction, whether it is called ‘'Benami" or colourable may be gone into.<br/> <br/>6. As to the contention that on rev­ersal of the order of the Additional District Judge that of the Subordinate Judge stood restored, we find it to be a mere question of technicality. Power of revision under section 115(1) C.P.C. may be exercised by the High Court Division even <em>suo motu</em>. The learned Single Judge has rightly relied upon a decision of the Supreme Court in the case of <strong><em>Md.</em></strong><strong><em> Swaleh V. Messers. United Grain and Fodaer Agencies 16 DLR (SC) 155</em></strong> on this point. More­over, the order of remand was based upon the view that the question of benami can be gone into, but when the learned Single Judge rejected this view as erroneous no purpose would have been served by remitting the case to the trial Court. We, therefore, find nothing to interfere with the impugned order of the High Court Division in this appeal also.<br/> <br/>7. In the result, both the appeals are dismissed without any costs.<br/> <br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
