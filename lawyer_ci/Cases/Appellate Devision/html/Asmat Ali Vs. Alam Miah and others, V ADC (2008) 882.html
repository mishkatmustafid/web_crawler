Ruhul Amin J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 11.05.2005 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 366 of 1999 discharging the Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong> Short facts are that the plaintiff institut­ed Title Suit No. 39 of 1996 in the Court of Assistant Judge, Patharghata, Barguna for declaration of title in the suit land as described in schedule "Kha" of the plaint stating inter alia, that the land measuring 1.99 acres of R.S. Khatian No. 395 of Mouza Limua, P.S. Patharghata, District-Barguna originally belonged to Kashem Ali in 4 annas share, Hemej Uddin and Kanchan Khan in 5 annas 10 gondas share each and Khatijan Bibi in 1 anna share in the reiyati right. Kanchan Khan sold .80 acre of land out of R.S. Khatian No. 395 to the plaintiff by registered kabala dated 24.05.1954. Although Kanchan Khan was entitled to get .68% acre of land in his 5 annas 10 gondas share. Since then the plaintiff has been in possession the suit land. The defendants claimed the suit land on 11.07.1996 on the basis of S.A. record, which is wrong.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>  The defendant No. 1 contested the suit by filing written, statement alleging, inter alia, that the suit is not maintainable and the suit is barred by limitation. The case of the defendant, in short, is that the land measuring 2.45 acres of C.S. Khatian No.46 of Mouza Ganoara originally belonged to Moajan and Malik and they sold 12 annas share to Jinnat Khan and 4 annas share to Kashem Ali. Jinnat Khan died leaving Annat Khan and Khatun Bibi as heirs and accordingly his interest in the suit land devolved upon them. Annat Khan died leaving two sons, namely, Hamej and Kanchan and two daughters namely, Asia and Rabiya as heirs. Annat Khan's heirs being owners of 1.32 acres settled the same land to Ajahar and others on 01.05.1950 and the S.A. Khatian was accordingly prepared. The plaintiff's kabala was collusive and forged and the S.A. Khatian recorded owners were not made parties in the suit. So the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> The trial court decreed the suit. Being aggrieved the defendants preferred Title Appeal No.11 of 1998 and the appellate court allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment and decree of the trial court. Being aggrieved the plaintiff moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdic­tion and the Rule was discharged as afore­said.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> We have heard Mr. Subhas Chandra Saha, the learned Advocate for the peti­tioner and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> It appears that previously the plaintiffs brought Title Suit No. 296 of 1956 in the Court of Assistant Judge, Pirojpur in respect of the suit land for recovery of khas possession and the pattan nama in the name of the defendants was challenged in the suit. The suit was dismissed on 26.11.1959. After lapse of 40 years, the present suit was instituted. The High Court Division held that the suit was hopelessly barred by limitation. The appellate court being the last court of fact also held the same view.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> In view of the discussion above, we are of the view that the High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision. There is no cogent reason to interfere with the same.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the leave petition is dis­missed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
