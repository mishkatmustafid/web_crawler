The facts of the case, in brief, are that the respondent No.1 herein, being the attorney of the owner, Hajera Bibi and her son, filed a suit being the Title Suit No.33 of 2000 in the Court of Assistant Judge, Third Court, Dhaka, praying for a decree for declaration of his title in the suit-land and recovery of the <em>khas</em> pos­session, contending, <em>inter alia,</em> that the suit land originally belonged to late Purna Chandra Ghose and others, that they transferred the suit-land to Hajera Bibi and her son Yasin by registered deeds dated 21.05.1954 but the property was requisitioned. That long thereafter the owners appointed the plaintiff as their attorney and left for abroad in 1988. The suit was re-numbered as the Title Suit No.40 of 2004 on being trans­ferred to Dhamrai Court, Dhaka. The present petitioners and the pro-forma respondent Nos. 2 and 3 were added as the defendants in the suit, vide Order No.30 dated 29.04.2002. The defendant Nos.1 to 3 and the added defendant Nos.4 to13 contested the suit by filing 2 (two) sets of written statements.<br/> <br/>3. The Trial Court, after hearing, decreed the suit.<br/> <br/>4. On appeals filed by the defendant Nos.1 to 3 and the added defendants being the Title Appeal No.121 of 2007 and Title Appeal No.141 of 2007 respec­tively, the learned District Judge, after hearing, allowed both the appeals.<br/> <br/>5. As such, the plaintiff-respondent No.1 herein, preferred civil revisions, being the Civil Revision No.5650 of 2007 and the Civil Revision No.5651 of 2007 before the High Court Division. The Court after hearing made both the Rules absolute by one Judgment and Order.<br/> <br/>6. Being aggrieved, this petition has been filed.<br/> <br/>7. Mr. Masood R. Sobhan, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioners, submits <em>inter-alia</em> that the suit property is an abandoned property and it was published in Bangladesh Gazette in '<em>Ka</em>' list of the abandoned properties in 1986, that besides, the power of attorney by which the plaintiff claims the suit-property does not even include the suit property, as such, the plaintiff cannot claim the said property.<br/> <br/>8. We have heard the learned Advocates for both the parties and perused the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division and also the judgments and decrees passed by the Courts below.<br/> <br/>9. It appears that Musammat Hazera Bibi wife of Haji Nasiruddin Allahwala and her son Md. Yahya purchased an area of 2 (two) <em>bighas</em> 2 (two) <em>chattak</em> and 17 sq.ft. in C.S. Plot Nos. 355 (western part) and 354, recorded in C.S. <em>Khatian</em> Nos.12334 and 12214, being the holding No.11 and 11/1, Joy Chandra Nag Road, Dhaka, from the original admitted recorded tenants on 24.05.1954 by an Indenture of Lease in perpetuity and also by a Deed of Sale, the superior Lakheraj and Mirash right was conveyed to the purchasers. These Deed of Lease in perpetuity and the Deed of Sale do not include the premis­es at the holding No. 11/2, Joy Chandra Nag Road. It also appears that the said holding No.11/2 was included in the 'Ka' List of the list of the Abandoned Properties, prepared in pursuance of Section 5(1) (ka) of the Ordinance No.LIV of 1985. Published in Bangladesh Gazette on 23.09.1986.<br/> <br/>10. The aforesaid Hajera Bibi and her son Md. Yasin appointed Md. Aynul Miah, their attorney by an irrevocable Power of Attorney, executed and regis­tered on 08.11.1988, on the ground that Hajera Bibi was unable to move freely because of her old age and her son Md. Yasin was leaving Bangladesh shortly for taking up job abroad. The Power of Attorney allows the attorney to look after the properties mentioned in the Schedule to take house-building loan on mortgage of the said property and also to arrange selling of the property, for and on behalf of his principals.<br/> <br/>11. The power of attorney dated 08.11.1988 shows that Hajera Bibi and her son used to reside at 11/1, Joynag Road on that date and it is stated therein that they were owner of the property by inheritance which was not correct at all. They were owner by purchase them­selves and not by inheritance from Late Haji Nasiruddin Allahwalla. There is no explanation about such wrong statement about the source of their ownership. Besides, the properties mentioned in the schedule of the power of attorney con­tains only the premises at holding No.11 and 11/1, Joynag Road and does not mention the holding No.11/2, Joynag Road. It also appears that the plaintiff-respondent No.1 herein, filed the suit on his own behalf and not on behalf of his principals. Rather, he himself claimed ownership in the entire 0.75 acres of land including 0.33 acres in the holding No.1-1/2, Joynag Road on the strength of the power of attorney dated 08.11.1988 which is apparently in negation of the rights of his principals as the real own­ers of the properties, as opposed to his right as their mere attorney.<br/> <br/>12. These facts escaped the notice of the High Court Division and also the Courts below.<br/> <br/>13. Under the circumstances, leave is granted on the following points:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">I. Whether the plaintiff’s suit in his own name, instead of his principals, is maintainable.<br/>II. Whether a plaintiff can claim a declaration of title, in his own name, by virtue of a mere power of attor­ney, executed by his principal.<br/>III. Whether a suit can be filed in respect of a property which is already included in the 'Ka' list of the lists of abandoned properties.<br/>IV. Whether a suit can be filed on the basis of a power of attorney in respect of the suit property which is not even included in the schedule to the said power of attorney.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Security of Tk.1000/- is to be deposited within one month.<br/> <br/>The preparation of paper-book dispensed with as prayed for.<br/> <br/>Let the order of stay granted earlier by this Court shall continue till disposal of the appeal.<br/> <br/>Let the appeal be made ready for expeditious hearing.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
