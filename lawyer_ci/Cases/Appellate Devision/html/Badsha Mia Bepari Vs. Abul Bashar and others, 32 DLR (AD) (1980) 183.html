Fact is that the appellant filed O.C. Suit No. 120 of 1963 in the Second Court of Munsif, Lakshmipur, Noakhali for specific performance of contract against Respondent No. 5. The suit was decreed and the properties were conveyed in favour of the Appellant through Court by a registered Kabala dated 18.9.70. On 6.1.1971 Respondents 1-4 filed a pre-emption case being Mise. Case No. 4 of 1971 under section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act for pre­emption of the said transfer on the ground that they are the co-sharers by purchase from Respondent No. 5 Jogendra Kishore Chokraborty, by virtue of a Kabala dated 14.5.63. The appellant filed a written objection con­tending that the Respondents were not co-share's and that it was a homestead land with a tin shed standing thereon and as it is not an agricultural land, it is not pre-emptible.<br/>The Munsif dismissed the pre-emption case but the Court of appeal below allowed the pre-emption case.<br/> <br/>The High Court Division in Civil Revision discharged the Rule by holding that the lower appellate Court had not committed any illega­lity or material irregularity in allowing the pre­emption.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong> Leave was granted to consider two ques­tions, first is, whether a sale completed in pur­suance of a decree for specific performance of contract is pre-emptible under section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, and the second question is, if the decree for specific performance of con­tract relates back to the date of agreement whether the pre-emptor had any locus standi. Of the two questions, the second question is dependent on the answer to the first.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> Miah Abdul Gafur, learned Advocate on Record appearing for the appellant tried to argue that the transfer referred to in sec­tion 96 of the Act denotes voluntary and not involuntary transfer under a decree for specific performance of contract. The contention is difficult to accept as a reference to section shows that the word 'transfer' is not hedged or qualified by any way limiting its opera­tion to the extent the learned Advocate-on-Record wants to establish. There being no word of limitation as to the nature of transfer in the section any transfer which is a transfer in the eye of law subject to the restriction laid down in the section is pre­emption, In this regard the decision of Chandra Kumar Maladas vs. Abdul Motaleb (1967) 19 DLR (SC) 36 may be cited where an auc­tion sale was assumed without contest to be pre-emptible under section 26F of the Ben­gal Tenancy Act. The language of section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act is substantially the same as that of section 26F of the Bengal Tenancy Act and so the cited decision gives ample authority for holding that a sale in pursuance of a decree for specific performance of contract is pre-emptible.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> There is another more cognet reason for holding such a sale to be pre-emptible. Though the sale is in pursuance of a decree of a Court but the decree is for specific performance of contract entered into by the parties. What is done under the decree is that a recalcitrant party to a contract is compelled to execute the sale deed for which he has earlier bargained to sell. That being the position the character of the sale remains a transfer intervivos and the intervention of the Court only completes the transaction which the parties to the contract otherwise ought to have completed. For this reason, we find that a sale in pursuance of a decree for specific performance of contract is pre­-emptible. The first contention of Miah A. Gufur fails.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> So far as the second question is concerned no doubt there is an authority in the case of Johar Mill Bhutra Vs. Jatindra Nath Base 34 C.L.J. 79 where the principle of doctrine of this pendency has been extended to a date anterior to the date of the suit by holding that a decree for specific performance of contract relates back to the date of agree­ment. We do not propose to give our conclu­ded opinion on this view as the proposition enunciated by this authority is not at all rele­vant for the disposal of this appeal as the sale itself is pre-emptible and so this question of sale relating back becomes academic having no bearing with merits of the appeal. For the foregoing reason this appeal is dismissed with costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
