Respondent No. 1 (since dead) as plain­tiff instituted Title Suit No. 160 of 1966 in the 1st Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka for dec­laration that he is a raiyat in respect of 24.67 acres of nul land apeartaining to C. S. Plot No. 1474 under khatian 1/29, Touzi No. 133 of Kaliakoir Mouza within P.S. Kaliakoir Dist. Dhaka and for further declaration that record-of -right in respect of the said land is incorrect.<br/> <br/>3. The case of the plaintiff, inter alia, was that the suit property originally belonged to the then Zaminder of Kashimpur, who made a set­tlement of the same with the plaintiff in 1946 and since then the plaintiff has been possessing the same. The suit property has wrongly been recorded in favour of the forest department of the Government of East Pakistan, who have no right, title and interest therein.<br/> <br/>4. The appellant Government and the pres­ent respondent Nos. 2-4 the officers of the appellant, as defendants contested the suit by filing written statement denying the claim of the plaintiff as a raiyat in respect of the suit land and asserting therein that the suit property is a notified forest land as per gazette Notification 3125/F.O.R dated 13.4.55.<br/> <br/>5. On the date of hearing of the suit those defendants having failed to appear, the suit was decreed ex parte on 9.9.67. On 1.9.70, the appel­lant and the plaintiff respondents instituted Title Suit No. 202 of 1970 in the 1st Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka for a decree to set aside the aforesaid ex parte decree alleging inter alia, that the same had been obtained by the plaintiff of that suit fraudulently and collusively. Their case in short is that the Clark of the Government pleader in collusion with the plain­tiff of that suit did neither pay the adjournment cost nor inform the present appellant and its officers of the date of hearing of the suit, as a result the suit was decreed ex parte and thereby the Government have been seriously preju­diced.<br/> <br/>6. The respondent No. 1 as defendant No. 1 also contested the suit by filing written state­ment denying the material allegations made in the plaint and contended, inter alia, that the present appellant had willfully defaulted in making appearance in the suit because there was no gazette notification declaring the suit property as a reserved forest. Considering the oral evidence of one P.W. Two D.Ws and the documentary evidence the trial Court decreed the suit. On an appeal, preferred by defendant respondent No. 1, the lower appellate court allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit hold­ing, inter alia, that the plaintiff could not prove the allegations of collusion and fraud as alleged in the plaint. The present appellant then pre­ferred the Second Appeal against the decree of the lower appellate Court, which has been affirmed by the impugned judgment and decree passed by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>7. Leave was granted to consider the fol­lowing submissions made by the learned Additional Attorney General. The suit land being reserve forest under Notification 3125-FOR dated 13 April 1955 issued under Section 4 of the Forest Act, 1927 (Ext. 1) Title Suit No. 160 of 1966 was barred under Section 20(2)(a) (iii) of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 and as such the trial Court had no jurisdic­tion to try that suit in view of the provision of Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure and hence the impugned ex parte decree passed in the aforesaid title suit being void ab initio ought to have been Set aside by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>In the plaint it has been clearly averred that the clerk of the Government pleader in Collusion with the plaintiff of T.S. No. 160 of 1966 did neither pay the adjournment cost nor inform the defendants of the suit about the date of its peremptory hearing, which resulted with the passing of an ex parte decree adversely effecting the vital interest of the Government in respect of a vast tract of notified government forest land and as such for the ends of justice the ex parte decree should be set aside.<br/> <br/>8. Mr. A. W. Bhuiyan, learned Additional Attorney General appearing for the appellant, submits that in the plaint of Title Suit No. 160 of 1966 the plaintiff admitted that the Suitland has been recorded as government forest and that the present appellant has proved Ext. 1 the gazette notification in support of the nature of the suit land as the recorded government forest and as such in view of the provision of sub-sec­tion (2)(a)(iii) of section 20 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 the learned Judge of the High Court Division erred in not holding that the Title Suit No. 160 of 1966 was not maintainable and thereby the ex parte decree dated 9.9.67 passed in that suit being a nullity is liable to be set aside. Mr. Bhuiyan, further sub­mits that the plaintiffs having proved that they were not informed about the date of hearing of Title Suit No. 160 of 1966 and were also not informed about the, requirement to pay the adjournment cost and as a result the plaintiff could neither pay adjournment costs nor could contest the suit on the date of its peremptory hearing and thereby the plaintiff legally proved the necessary facts and circumstances to sub­stantiate the allegations of collusion in between the clerk of the Government pleader and the plaintiff of the Title Suit No. 160 of 1966, the lower appellate court upon improper assump­tion of facts wrongly revered the finding of collusion, found by the trial Court on the evidence on record and as such the learned Judge of the High Court Division erred in not setting aside the judgment of the lower appellate court at least in the greater interest of doing justice.<br/> <br/>9. Syed Badrul Alam, learned Advocate appearing for defendant respondent No. 1, on the other hand, submits that Abbas Ali Munshi got the settlement of the suit land from the Ex-Zaminder as far back as in 1946 and as such it cannot be the said that the learned Subordinate Judge had no jurisdiction to try Title Suit No. 160 of 1966 in view of the provision of Section 20(2) (a) (iii) of State Acquisition and Tenancy Act 1950.<br/> <br/>10. Mr. Alam further submits that the lower appellate court having held that the plaintiff could not prove by producing the gazette notifi­cation that the disputed plot is a part of Government "reserved forest and accordingly the learned Additional District Judge having rightly reversed the decree of the trial Court upon fresh consideration of the evidence on record the learned Judge of the High Court Division did not commit any error of law in passing the impugned decree.<br/> <br/>11. It appears from the plain, of the Title Suit No. 160 of 1966 that the plaintiff could not specify any date of his taking the alleged settle­ment of such big plot of land measuring 24.67 acres from the Ex-landlord. It was found by the trial court that defendant No. 1 of the present suit as plaintiff could not produce any docu­ment supporting his alleged settlement of the suit plot. The trial court on consideration of the evidence of P.W. and DWs and the documents of both the parties, produced before it, believed the plaintiff's allegations that the ex parte decree of Title Suit No. 160 of 1966 was the result of fraud and collusion in between the plaintiff and the clerk of the Government pleader and accordingly set aside the ex parte decree for the ends of justice making a scope for proper adju­dication in the matter. The lower appellate Court without considering these aspects of the case wrongly observed; 'However, the scope of deci­sion is whether the respondents could establish fraud in the matter of ordering ex parte decree but the respondents have failed. The learned Sub-judge is absolutely wrong in deciding the suit on the irrelevant ground which is not based on evidence on record."<br/> <br/>12. It appears that a vast tract of land with­in the reserved forest has been claimed by Abbas ali Munshi as the plaintiff in Title Suit No. 160 of 1966 on the basis of taking pattan from the ex-landlord in the year 1946. But in that suit he could not produce any supporting evidence of title as claimed. Moreover, in view of the statement made in the plaint that the suit land has been recorded as forest land the, trial court committed an error of law in decreeing the suit, mechanically, ex parte without consid­ering the effect of the provisions of the S.A.T. Act as well as the Specific Relief Act.<br/> <br/>13. In the facts and circumstances of the case we are of the opinion that for doing com­plete justice the appeal should be allowed for having a proper adjudication in the matter of the real dispute, i.e. the title of respondent No. 1 in the suit plot.<br/> <br/>14. In such view of the matter this appeal is allowed without, however, any order as to cost. In pursuance thereof the decrees of the High Court Division as well as the lower appellate court are set aside and that of the trial court is restored.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
