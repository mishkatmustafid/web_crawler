Ruhul Amin J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>The Review petition is by the Government against the judgment and order dated February 27, 2001 in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 521 of 1996 dismiss­ing the same.<br/> <br/>2. The Civil petition for leave to appeal was filed against the judgment and order dated June 26, 1996 of a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 3 of 1988 making the Rule absolute and thereupon making direc­tion to release the property from the 'ka' list of the abandoned property published in the gazette dated June 23, 1986 upon setting aside the judg­ment and order dated October 7, 1987 passed in Settlement Case No. 526 of 1987 (ka-1005 Mirpur Section 1 and 2 ) Holding No. 2-E/5-2 Mirpur, Dhaka.<br/> <br/>3. Facts, in short, are that case holding was leased out on October 26, 1962 to one S.K. Rezvi, who died in 1965 leaving behind wife Bahar Ara (Respondent No.4) and 2 minor sons - Zakir Hossain Rezvi, and Iftekhar Rezvi. The mother of the minors was appointed their guardian. On mortgaging the property loan was obtained from the House Building Finance Corporation and the heirs of S.K. Rezvi con­structed building in the land got by lease. The Respondent No. 4 entered into an agreement with the Respondent No. 1 herein to sell the land with the building of the holding in ques­tion. Since the Respondent No. 4 failed to execute deed of transfer, the Respondent No. 1 filed Title Suit No. 3 of 1979 which was later on renumbered as Title Suit No. 1375 of 1981. The said suit was decreed and a kabala was obtained through Court on January 3, 1984.<br/> <br/>4. As the property was listed as per provi­sions of Ordinance No. 54 of 1985 as aban­doned property and the said list was published in the gazette the Respondent No. 1 filed Settlement Case No. 526 of 1987 before the Court of Settlement seeking release of the prop­erty from the list abandoned property. The Respondent No. 4 also filed Settlement Case No. 525 of 1987 seeking release of the property of the holding in question. The Court of Settlement dismissed both the cases.<br/> <br/>5. Thereupon the Respondent No. 1 moved the High Court Division in writ jurisdiction questioning legality of the judgment and order of the Court of Settlement. The High Court Division on a finding that the owner of the property i.e. vendor as has never left Bangladesh. The Court of Settlement in holding the property as abandoned property seriously erred as there is no basis for making the said finding. The High Court Division further held that the Court of Settlement in the facts and cir­cumstance of the case acted without lawful authority in dismissing the case No. 526 of 1987 filed seeking release of the property and thereupon made the Rule absolute making the direction as stated hereinabove.<br/> <br/>6. As against the judgment and order of the High Court Division petitioner filed petition for leave to appeal as mentioned above. This Division by the judgment and order dated February 27, 2001 dismissed the same upon observing "In a situation when the heirs of orig­inal allottee were all through in this country the High Court Division rightly found that the property has been wrongly enlisted as aban­doned property. This aspect of the matter has not been properly considered by the Court of Settlement".<br/> <br/>7. The learned Additional Attorney General submits that this Division erred in dismissing the leave petition placing reliance on a decree obtained in the suit for specific performance of contract to sell the property in question and as such the judgment and order of this Division rejecting the leave petition requires review since the said judgment and order is contrary to the settled principle of law that decree in a suit for specific performance of contract to sell land is not a bar in listing a property as an abandoned property under the provisions of section 5 of the Ordinance  No. 54 of 1985. The  learned Additional Attorney General also submits that High court Division erred in setting aside the judgment of the Court of Settlement which is a well reasoned one and that said judgment was made upon consideration of the facts and cir­cumstances of the case in the background of the papers and the evidence brought on record by the parties.<br/> <br/>8. The contention of the learned Additional Attorney General that this Division in rejecting the leave petition based its judgment on the decree obtained in a suit for specific performance of contract to sell the property in question is not correct. This Division considered the fact that one of the heirs of the original allottee appeared before the court and deposed in sup­port of the fact that she and her sons at no point of time left Bangladesh and that she obtained Nationality Certificate from the competent authority. The Court of Settlement did not con­sider this vital aspect of the case in its correct perspective. The other contention that judgment of the Court of Settlement ought not to have been set aside by the High Court Division since the same has been made upon consideration of the materials on record is also of no substance since the important fact i.e. presence of the heirs of the allottee in Bangladesh at all materi­al time has not been properly considered by the Court of Settlement. No material was placed on record from the side of the petitioner, in support of considering and listing the property as an abandoned property and as such as the listing of the property was not legal the High Court Division was quite legal in setting aside the judgment of the Court of Settlement rejecting the prayer of the Respondent No. 1 for releasing the property from the list of abandoned build­ings. The respondent Nos. 1 and 4 have suffi­ciently discharged the onus as requires by sec­tion 5(2) of Ordinance No. 54 of 1985.<br/> <br/>In the background of the discussions made herein over there is no substance in the review petition.<br/> <br/>Accordingly the review petition is dis­missed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
