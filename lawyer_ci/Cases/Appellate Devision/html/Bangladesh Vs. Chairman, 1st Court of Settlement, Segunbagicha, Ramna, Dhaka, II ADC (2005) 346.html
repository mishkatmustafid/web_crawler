Hamidul Haque J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This appeal has been filed against the judgment and order dated 27.10.1997 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 1370 of 1994. Leave was granted by the order-dated 9.8.2000 to consider the question whether the decree obtained by respondent No. 2 in a suit for specific performance of contract in respect of a property which has been enlisted as an abandoned property in the "Ka" list is a bar for inclusion of such property as an abandoned property and whether the High Court Division misdirected itself in law in deciding the writ petition in not considering the question that the onus to prove that the property in question was not an abandoned property was squarely upon the claimant and the government had no obliga­tion to disclose the basis of treating the proper­ty as an abandoned property. Leave was also granted to consider whether the High Court Division fell into an error in holding that the property in question was not an abandoned property without giving any finding as to whether the original owner was present in Bangladesh or his whereabouts were known when the President's Order 16 of 1972 was promulgated.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong> Respondent No. 2, Md. Ziaul Islam filed an application under section 7 of the Abandoned Buildings (Supplementary Provisions) Ordinance, 1985 for exclusion of House No. 5/23, Block-D, Nurjahan Road, Mohammadpur from the "Ka" list of abandoned buildings published on 23.9.1986 in the official gazette. Md. Ziaul Islam claimed that Mustafa Ashraf took lease of the house property from the government of the then East Pakistan on the basis lease deed dated 27.7.1960 but subse­quently by two agreements dated 28.7.1968 and 6.2.70, the original allottee entered into a con­tract with him for selling the house to him. He further claimed that possession was delivered to him by the original allottee on the basis of that agreement. Md. Ziaul Islam, further claimed that he filed a suit for specific performance of contract (Title Suit No. 12 of 1975) against the original allotee and in that suit the Government of Bangladesh was also defendant. The suit was decreed and on execution of the decree, he got a kabala through the court. Considering all the facts and circumstances specially considering the fact that the petitioner of the case i.e. Md. Ziaul Isalam was able to prove his title and pos­session in the case property, the court of settle­ment declared that the case property was not abandoned property. Thereafter, Writ Petition No. 1370 of 1994 was filed on behalf of the People's Republic of Bangladesh represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Works challenging the judgment and order passed by the 1st Court of settlement. The High Court Division after elaborate discussion found that there was no illegality in the impugned judgment of the Court of settlement and accordingly, the Rule was discharged by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> Mr. Abdur Razaque Khan, the learned Additional Attorney-General appearing on behalf of the appellant confined his argument mainly on one point. He has argued that before the Court of Settlement, Md. Ziaul Islam could not prove his possession in the property in ques­tion and the Court of settlement erroneously arrived at a finding that the petitioner proved his possession. Mr. Abdur Razaque Khan, clar­ified his argument by saying that the Court of settlement and also the High Court Division believed the claim of the petitioner's possession relying on the deeds of agreement. Then after taking us through the two deeds of agreement, he has submitted that in the deed of 1968 there is nothing to show that possession was delivered to Md. Ziaul Islam by the original allotee. Further, he has submitted that in the deed of agreement of 1970, only it is mentioned that Md. Ziaul Islam was inducted into possession. Mr. Abdur Razaque Khan has pointed out that no date of induction into possession is men­tioned in the deed of 1970.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> Mr. Mahmudul Islam the senior counsel who appeared for respondent No. 2, Md. Ziaul Islam, has submitted that in part performance of contract under section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, possession was delivered to the respondent No. 2 by the original allotee before date of execution of the second bainapatra, which was executed on 6.2.1970. He has further submitted that there was no material either before the Court of settlement or before the High Court Division to disbelieve the claim of delivering possession to the respondent No. 2 by the original allotee.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> Mr. Abdur Razaque Khan, however, has argued that the Court of settlement ought to have made proper inquiry to ascertain whether the petitioner of the case was in possession or some one else in possession of the case proper­ty. Mr. Abdur Razaque Khan has invited our attention to the additional paper book and sub­mitted that one Tariqul Islam was actually in possession of House No. 5/23, Block-D, Nurjahan Road, Mohammadpur. The present appellant was a party in the Title Suit No. 12 of 1975, which was filed by the respondent No. 2 for a decree for specific performance of contract. The appellant was also party in the case filed before the Court of settlement and also in the writ petition. The appellant had the opportu­nity to produce relevant papers to show that Md. Ziaul Islam was not actually in possession of the case property. The question that Md. Ziaul Islam was not in possession of the case property having been raised for the first time before this Court, there is no scope of consider­ing this question at this stage by this Court.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> However, we have considered the argument of Mr. Abdur Razaque Khan that the Court of settlement ought to have made proper inquiry. Mr. Abdur Razaque Khan has pointed out that the Court of settlement relied on the deeds of agreement and those were not suffi­cient to arrive at a conclusion that the petition­er was in possession. Power and procedure of the Court of settlement is laid down in section 10 of the Abandoned Buildings (Supplementary Provisions) Ordinance, 1985. Sub-section (5) of section 10 provides that a Court of settlement shall, after such inquiry as it may deem neces­sary and after giving reasonable opportunity to the parties concerned of being heard and also adducing evidence, both oral and documentary, may make such decision as it deems fit. In the instant case, the Court of settlement made inquiry to ascertain genuineness of the deeds of agreement. The Court of settlement called for the relevant file of Housing and Settlement Department and found that the signature of the original allotee found in that file tally with the signatures as contained in the bainapatras. In this way the Court of settlement, after being sat­isfied about the genuineness of bainapatra, came to the finding that the respondent No.2 proved his title and possession in the case prop­erty.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> The High Court Division also made elab­orate discussion on the question of possession and arrived at the finding that the respondent No.2 (the petitioner before the court of settle­ment) was in possession on the basis of the deeds of agreement. We find no illegality in the findings of the Court of Settlement or of the High Court Division on the question of posses­sion. We have perused the principle laid down in the case of <em>Buxly Paints Limited Vs. Bangladesh</em> reported in <em>31 DLR (AD) 266</em> and <em>Bangladesh Vs.  K.M. Zakir Hossain</em> reported in <em>8 BLC (AD) 27</em>. In the above two cases ques­tion arose as to the right of a person in posses­sion of the abandoned property on the basis of agreement for sale and it has been decided that such property cannot be taken over as an aban­doned property. The respondent No. 2 claimed his possession in the property on the basis of two deeds of agreement, which were executed in 1968 and 1970, that is, both the deeds were executed prior to the war of liberation. The appellant could not produce any material to dis­believe the possession of the respondent No. 2 which he claimed on the basis of the deeds of agreement. There is also nothing on record to show that possession was taken over from the respondent No. 2 so as to list the building in 'Ka" list. In view of the fact that the respondent No. 2 came into possession at least In the year 1970 when the second deed of agreement was executed, the question whether the original owner was present in Bangladesh when the Presidents Order No. 16 of 1972 was promulgated is not at all relevant. The respondent No. 2 made the prayer for exclusion of the case prop­erty from "Ka" list not on the basis of a decree which he obtained in the suit for specific per­formance of contract but on the basis of the deeds of agreement and claimed that he had been in possession from before promulgation of the President Order 16 of 1972.When his pos­session in the case property has been proved on the basis of the deeds of agreement, the last one being executed in February, 1970, there is no scope of enlisting the case property in the "Ka" list as abandoned property. We find no infirmi­ty in the judgment and order passed by the court of settlement or by the High Court Division in the Writ Petition No. 1370 of 1994.<br/> <br/>In the result, the appeal is dismissed with­out any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
