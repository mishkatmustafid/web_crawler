The questions are whether the property of Respondent No. 1 is an abandoned property and, even if it were not an abandoned property, whether its subsequent placement under the Corporation as an industrial enterprise is valid under the Nationalisation of Industrial Enterprises Order, 1972.<br/> <br/>2. Facts of the case have been set out in detail in the Judgment of my learned brother <strong>Mustafa Kamal, J</strong>. I would therefore not repeat them but I shall discuss them in brief where it is necessary. Both these appeals‑‑Civil Appeal Nos. 31 and 40 of 1991‑have arisen from Writ Petition No. 365 of 1987 which has been disposed of by the impugned Judgment of the High Court Division dated 5 March 1991.<br/> <br/>3. Respondent No. 1 is a Company named and styled M/s Dhaka Steel Works Ltd. and respondent Nos. 2‑4 are its Directors. This Company, along with its assets and properties, will be referred to, in this Judgment as "the industrial enterprise" or the Respondents' enterprise. Government of Bangladesh, (Appellant in CA No. 31 of 1991) by a notification dated 7 March 1972, (Annexure‑A) took over the control and management of this enterprise, as they say , under the Bangladesh (Taking over of Control and Management of Industrial and Commercial Concerns) Order, 1972 (Acting President's Order No. 1 of 1972, briefly APO 1 of 1972). Ground for such taking over was that the owners or managers of the enterprise were not available to control and manage it. Respondents made representation to the Government saying that the property was not an abandoned property and as such its taking over was illegal and prayed for its release, but the Government did not accept this contention. On and from 26 March 1972 the Bangladesh Industrial Enterprises (Nationalisation) Order, 1972‑PO No. 27 of 1972 came into force providing, among other things, for nationalisation of certain industrial enterprises and for establishment of Corporation for the purpose of control, supervision and co‑ordination of such enterprises. In pursuance of Article 10(l) (d) of this Order the Government issued another notification dated 17 May 1972 (Annexure‑H) placing this enterprise under the Bangladesh Steel and Engineering Corporation, better known as the Steel Mills Corporation. This Corporation is the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 40 of 1991. Respondents continued to make representations to the Government, one after another, for releasing the enterprise making the same contention that it was not an abandoned property but the Government this time replied that since this industrial enterprise was placed under the Corporation under PO No. 27 of 1972 it already vested in the Government and that this vesting could not be questioned in any court of law. Government, however, indicated that the enterprise might be disinvested or transferred to the respondents if they could establish their claim that they are owners of the majority shares thereof. At one stage, during a short-lived amendment of Article 10(l), Government also took a tentative decision to release the enterprise but did not proceed further. Thereupon the respondents filed the writ petition which was allowed giving them a number of relieves, such as the taking over of the enterprise as an abandoned property and the Governments refusal to implement its earlier decision or order dated 28 January 1976 for releasing the property, were declared invalid and that Government was directed to release the property within three months from the date of the order.<br/> <br/>4. Leave was sought for filing appeal against this order both by the Government and the Corporation. Government's contentions are that the enterprise in fact was an abandoned property and as such it was rightly taken over and that even if it were not an abandoned property but its subsequent placement under the Corporation under PO No. 27 of 1972 is valid and that it having been vested in the Government, such vesting could not have been questioned by the Court. Leave was granted to the Government to consider these contentions. Leave was also granted to the Corporation to consider its contentions that it got <em>locus standi</em> to question the impugned order of the High Court Division and that the High Court Division's finding that the majority share‑holders of the Company including the respondents are Bangladeshi got no basis whatever.<br/> <br/>5. Government of Bangladesh in exile returned to Dhaka on 23 December 1971 after the war of liberation, which had left the country's economy shattered and devastated. Many industrial and commercial concerns were found abandoned or left uncared for, by their owners and managers. In these circumstances, the Acting President made an Order, No. IM‑35/71‑13, dated 26 December 1971. Under this Order the Acting President authorised the Ministry of Commerce to take over such industrial and commercial concerns, in the interest of the country's economy, for putting them into operation immediately. Four days later, this Order was amended by Notification No. See XI/IM‑35/71/30 dated 30 December 1971, only to the extent that, in addition to the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Industries and Natural Resources was also authorised by the Acting President to take over the management of any industrial or commercial concern. This Order is therefore, neither a separate nor an independent Order. The Order dated 26 December 1971, with the amendment, remained in force till 3 January 1972 on which date it was repealed by the Acting President's Order No. 1 of 1972, as already referred to above. This Order provided that (1) Where the owners, directors or managers of any industrial or commercial concern have left Bangladesh or, (2) are not available to control and manage the concern or, (3) Where, in the opinion of the Government, the owners or directors of such concern cannot be allowed, in the public interest, to control and manage the concern, the Government may, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law in force, take over its control and management. Article 6 thereof repealed the Acting president's Order dated 26 December 1971 but saved “all notifications issued under the said Order which shall be deemed to have been issued under the relevant provision of this Order" (APO 1 of 1972).<br/> <br/>6. Neither the APO dated 26 December 1971 nor APO No. 1 of 1972, though they provide for taking over of certain industrial or commercial concerns, refers to, or describes any 'abandoned property'. The concept of 'abandoned property' appears for the first time in the Bangladesh Abandoned Property (Control, Management and Disposal) Order, 1972‑PO No.16 of 1972, which came into force with effect from 28 February 1972, Article 2(l) of PO No. 16 of 1972 says that "abandoned property" means any property owned by any person who is not present in Bangladesh of whose whereabouts are not known or who has ceased to occupy, supervise or manage in person his property"; and further, such property includes "any property taken over under the APO No. 1 of 1972." It is thus clear that any property which is taken over under the APO No. 1 of 1972 shall be necessarily an abandoned property under the PO No. 16 of 1972 it being immaterial whether the character and description of the said property agree with that of an "abandoned property" under the PO No.16 of 1972. As to the PO No. 27 of 1972, which provides for nationalisation of industrial enterprises, it came into force on 26 March 1972. Thus, it is found that from 26 December 1971 to 26 March 1972 these three Presidential Orders were made providing for taking over of certain properties including industrial and commercial enterprises.<br/> <br/>7. Now it is to be seen under which law the industrial enterprise of respondents was taken over. Mr. AW Bhuiyan, learned Additional Attorney-General, explains that it was taken over under APO No. 1 of 1972; but the notification dated 7‑3‑72 (Annexure‑F) shows that it was issued under APO dated 30 December 1971. Khondker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, learned Counsel for the respondents, contends that the enterprise was taken over under a repealed law. APO dated 30 December is not an independent Order; it only amended the APO dated 26 December 1971, which was repealed by APO No. 1 of 1972. This order (APO No. 1 of 1972) was in force when the enterprise was taken over. Learned Additional Attorney‑General explains that in the Notification dated 7‑3‑72 the APO dated 30 December was cited by mistake due to over‑sight. This explanation appears to be quite reasonable. When the law (APO No. 1 of 1972) was there and the conditions for application were fulfilled the mere citing of the repealed law will not bring the application within the ambit of the repealed law. The error pointed out is a mere technicality and as such is ignored.<br/> <br/>8. Khondker Mahbubuddin Ahmed next contends that the APO No.1 of 1972 was non­existent on 7.3.72 as it stood repealed by necessary implication when the PO 16 of 1972 covering the same field came into force from 28 February, 1972. in this connection the learned Counsel cited the case on <strong><em>M/s Masood Reza and others Vs. Government of Bangladesh, 30 DLR (AD) 169,</em></strong> Subject‑matter of that case was a commercial concern, a sister enterprise of the respondents, which was taken over by the Government under the APO No. 1 of 1972 and then was placed under the Corporation under PO No. 27 of 1972. The same question as to repeal by necessary implication was raised in that case also; but the case was decided on other grounds. However, an observation was made in the Judgment of that case expressing doubt about the validity of APO No. 1 of 1972 since 28 February, 1972. On examination of the scope and field of both the statutes, I reject this argument that the APO No.1 of 1972 was repealed by necessary implication, for these two statutes do not wholly over‑lap and that the scope of the earlier Statutes is much wider than that of the later one and that the former after several amendments since 28 February, 1972 has been protected under Article 47 of the Constitution. I find the earlier one, APO No. 1 of 1972, to be a continuing law and on this point I agree on the reasons given by my learned brother <strong>Mustafa Karnal J</strong>.<br/> <br/>9. Khondker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, learned Counsel, contends that the Government in their Affidavit‑in‑opposition stated that they took over the enterprise as an abandoned property under PO No. 16 of 1972 but the learned Additional Attorney‑General now argued that the Government took over the property under APO No. 1 of 1972 and as such these two claims are contradictory. I do not find any substance in this contention for, as the law itself provides, any property, whatever may be its nature, if taken over under APO No.1 of 1972, is necessarily an abandoned property under PO No. 16 of 1972. But the main contention of the respondents is that the property could not have been taken over at all either under APO No. 1 of 1972 or treated as an abandoned property under PO No. 16 of 1972 since the directors of the respondent‑company were present in Bangladesh and available for managing it. Reference has been made to their representations starting from February 4, 1972 making this assertion. The learned Additional Attorney‑General has referred to one of such representations in which the respondents admitted that till 29 January 1972 they or their officers could not go to the office and premises of the enterprise in view of the hostile situation prevailing at that time. Because of the prevailing situation, the learned Additional Attorney-­General argues, many industrial and commercial concerns were left uncared for, by their owners and managers and that to put them into operation at once in the interest of the national economy, these two statutes were enacted. Respondents say that they were Bangladeshi nationals and were present in Bangladesh; this claim is not disputed by the Government but their contention is that the respondents were not available to operate the enterprise and as such it attracted both these statutes. The High Court Division has given undue importance to the question whether majority of the share‑holders of the respondent‑ company are Bangladeshi nationals and has found that majority of them are Bangladeshi nationals but this finding is also disputed and this question will be examined in connection with the Civil Appeal No. 40 of 1991 filed by the Corporation. To take over any commercial or industrial concern under APO No. 1 of 1972 the only thing to be considered in this case is whether its owners or managers were available to manage it. Government say that none among the respondents was found to manage it at relevant time and as such the Government took it over. So, unless there was any malafide intention of the Government, I find no reason why the Government's claim would not be accepted. Khondker Mahbubuddin Ahmed contends that the APO No. 1 being an expropriatory law, it should be construed strictly in favour of the citizen whose property‑right is taken away thereunder. The learned Additional Attorney-General disputes that this law is an expropriatory law; rather he contends, it is a protective legislation to protect the property from ruination at the relevant time. I need not join this issue for, I accept the argument of the learned Additional Attorney-General and find that the enterprise was validly taken over under APO No. 1 of 1972 and as such it is an abandoned property under PO No. 16 of 1972 as well.<br/> <br/>10. Now the second question, even if this industrial enterprise were not an abandoned property and as such its taking‑over were invalid, whether its subsequent placement under the Corporation is valid under the Industrial Enterprises Nationalisation Order,1972, P.O. No. 27 of 1972. The PO No. 27 of 1972 is intended to nationalises certain industrial enterprise and to establish some corporations for operation, control and management of such enterprises. One of the Corporations established under Article 10(1) of PO No. 27 of 1972 is the Steel Mills Corporation. Clause (d) of Article 10(1) of this Order provides that this Corporation shall exercise power of control, management and supervision of such industrial enterprises as the Government may place them under it by a notification. Such industrial enterprises which are to be placed, it is also provided, shall include the industrial enterprises owned by the Government under PO No. 16 of 1972 or owned or managed by any statutory Corporation. Under this provision in clause (d) of Article 10(1) the respondents' enterprise was placed under this Corporation by the second impugned Notification dated 17 May 1972 (Annexure-H). The learned Additional Attorney-General contends that with this placement, the enterprise vested in the Government and became immune from any attack or question in the court of law. He relies upon Article 10(1 A) and Article 4(1) of PO No. 27 of 1972.                  <br/> <br/>11. Article 10(1A) provides that not with    standing anything contained in any other law, an industrial enterprise, placed under any Corporation "shall be deemed to have always vested in the Government and no such order of placement shall be challenged on the ground that the industrial enterprise had not vested in the Government, or that the industrial enterprise was not liable to be vested in the Government". Article 4 (1) which was subsequently brought in by an Amendment, provides that "all such industrial enterprises placed under a Corporation by, or by an order under clause (1) of Article 10 and all shares and proprietory and other interests, as have not already vested in the Government by or under any law for the time being in force,<u> shall, by virtue of this Article</u> and without any further proceeding or formality, stand vested in, and allotted to, the Government free of any trust, mortgage, charge, lien, interest or other encumbrance whatsoever". (The underline is mine). It further provides that this vesting shall have effect from the date on which the enterprise was so placed. Thus the Simple case of the Government is that independent of any action taken previously under any other law, such as, APO No. 1 of 1972 or PO No. 16 of 1972, this enterprise was placed under the Corporation under the provision of the Industrial Enterprises Nationalisation Order, a law which was a vital necessity for the national economy. This placement, it is argued, cannot be assailed on any ground whatsoever, and as soon as the placement was made the enterprise vested in the Government.<br/> <br/>12. The High Court Division did not consider this aspect of the question taking an over-simplified view that a property which was not an abandoned property cannot be placed under the Corporation for, it is stated, if the taking over was invalid the very foundation of the Government's case was demolished and as such all subsequent actions of the Government in respect of this enterprise would be void. The reason is wrong, for Article 10(1) (d) does not say that only an abandoned property, first taken over under any other law, can be placed under the Corporation. Reliance was also placed by the High Court Division upon the decision of this Court in the case of <strong><em>Masood Reza 30 DLR (AD) 169</em></strong> in which it was held that only three categories of industrial enterprises could be placed under the Corporation, namely the enterprises owned by the government; the enterprises vested in the Government under PO No. 16 of 1972 and the enterprises owned and managed, by any statutory Corporation. This view is, with all respect, not correct, firstly, because, the relevant part of Article 10(1) (d) was misquoted in that Judgment and secondly, because the grammatical construction of the sentence has been overlooked. The industrial enterprises to be placed under the Corporation have been particularised by the word "such" at the beginning and the word "as” at the end. To be clear on this interpretation Article 10(1) (d) is quoted below:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Bangladesh Steel and Engineering Corporation shall have and exercise the powers of a Corporation under this Order in respect of such industrial enterprises, including enterprises owned wholly or partly by the Government under the Bangladesh Abandoned Property (Control, Management and Disposal) Order, 1972 (PO No. 16 of 1972) or owned or managed by any statutory corporation, as the Government may, by order published in the official Gazette, place under it."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It is thus clear that any industrial enterprise may be placed by the Government under the Corporation, and as to the industrial enterprises owned by the Government under PO No. 16 of 1972 or owned by any other statutory corporation; they shall be included among those enterprises which are placed. Therefore, the respondents' industrial enterprise, even if it were not an abandoned property and had not been vested in the Government earlier, it could be placed under the Corporation under PO No. 27 of 1972. Such placement is valid unless it is shown that the placement is prompted by any <em>malafide</em> intention. No ground of malafide has been taken in this case, nor can there be any question raised about it for, it is not only the respondent's enterprise which has been placed under the Corporation, but as many as twelve such enterprises belonging to other persons have also been placed under the Corporation by the same Notification (Annexure-H). I have therefore no hesitation to answer the second question in the affirmative holding that the placement of the "industrial enterprise" under the Corporation is valid and that in view of Articles 10 (1A) and 4(1) the enterprise vested in the Government and further that this vestment cannot be challenged in any court of law.<br/> <br/>13. As to the High Court Division's view that the Government is bound to implement their order dated 28 January 1976 for releasing the enterprise, I am clearly of the view that the High Court Division's view is erroneous and its direction for release of the enterprise is illegal and improper. There is no such order, nor any final decision of the Government for release of the enterprise as the tentative proposal for release remained in a formative stage, confined to the official file, and not communicated to the respondents. Procurement of a copy of such inconcluded decision or "order", as alleged by the respondents, is highly improper. This question has been elaborately dealt with in the Judgment of my learned brother and I agree with him on his finding.<br/> <br/>14. As to the appeal (Civil Appeal No. 40 of 1991) by the Corporation, the High Court Division has taken the view that the Corporation has no <em>locus‑standi</em> to file the appeal as it will rise or fall with the Government. Dr. Rafiqur Rahman, learned Counsel for the Corporation, has seriously assailed the High Court Division's view about <em>locus‑standi</em> and has argued that the Corporation having a separate entity of its own and invested a huge amount of money in this enterprise, its interests are directly affected by the High Court Division's finding that 'majority shareholders are Bangladeshi nationals'. Of the total 2,48,724 shares, he has pointed out, respondent Nos. 2‑4 held 1,10,000 shares representing 44% only; 260 shares are held by persons who are not Bangladeshi nationals, but the remaining 1,23,174 shares representing 50% shares are admittedly held by some banks and financial institutions under a "Buy Up" Agreement. Dr. Rafiqur Rahman has argued that at the relevant time Head Offices of these banks and financial Institutions were in the then West Pakistan region, and after Independence of Bangladesh, branches of those banks and financial institutions were organised and re‑structured into several banks and institutions, mostly nationalised, and as such it is not yet known what stand these institutions and banks will take regarding these shares. At least no no‑objection certificate, it is further argued, has been produced by the respondents from those banks and financial institutions. In view of this position, he has argued, the President's Secretariat advised the respondents to establish their title to those 50% shares under the Buy‑Up Agreement but they have not yet done so. Finding of the High Court Division regarding the share‑position of the respondent‑company has therefore got no basis, Dr. Rahman concludes.<br/> <br/>15. Ordinarily, the Corporation will rise or fall with the Government but in view of the disputed share holding position as described above, the Corporation got <em>locus‑standi</em> to file this appeal. The contention raised by the learned Counsel of this appellant (Corporation) has also substance.<br/> <br/>16. As to the likely remedy available to the respondents, since I have found that the order of placement of the enterprise under the Corporation is valid, the Government may, if in the national interest it deems it expedient so to do" transfer it to the respondents under Article 4(2) of PO No. 27 of 1972. In view of the fact that three allied commercial concerns of the respondents have been released under the Court's order, this case deserves favourable consideration. So far as the Writ Petition is concerned, it must fail; the impugned Judgment of the High Court Division is set aside and both the appeals are allowed, without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong><u>MH Rahman J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>I have gone through the Judgments proposed to be delivered by my lord the Chief Justice and my learned brother <strong>Mustafa Kamal, J</strong> I concur with the Judgment of my lord the Chief Justice.<br/> <br/><strong><u>ATM Afzal J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>I have gone through the Judgments proposed to be delivered by my lord the Chief Justice and my learned brother <strong>Mustafa Kamal, J.</strong> I concur with the Judgment of my brother M<strong>ustafa Kamal, J.</strong><br/> <br/><strong><u>Mustafa Kamal J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>The two crux issues involved in these two appeals by leave are whether, first, the respondent No.1 company M/s. Dhaka Steel Works Ltd., hereinafter referred to as the Company, which owned an industrial enterprise, was an abandoned property on its being allegedly taken over under the Bangladesh (Taking over of Control and Management of Industrial and Commercial Concerns) Order, 1972 (Acting President's Order No. 1 of 1972), shortly, APO No. 1 of 1972, and secondly, regardless of the first question, its shares and other proprietory interests have independently vested in the Government under Articles 4 and 10 (1A) of the Bangladesh Industrial Enterprises (Nationalisation) Order, 1972 (President’s Order No. 27 of 1972), shortly PO No. 27 of 1972, on its being placed under the erstwhile Bangladesh Steel Mills Corporation by a Notification in the official Gazette under clause (1) of Article 10 of PO No. 27 of 1972 on 17.5.72.<br/> <br/>20. The Company and three of its directors as petitioners filed Writ Petitions No. 365 of  1987 against the appellants in these two appears whereupon a Rule Nisi was issued and after hearing the parties a Division Bench of the High Court Division by Judgment and order dated 5‑3‑91 made the Rule absolute declaring that the taking over Of the Company and its assets and properties was without lawful authority and of no legal effect and directing the appellants to implement the order signed by the Secretary and Adviser-in-charge of the Ministry of industries on 20.1.76 and 28.1.76 respectively and to release the property of the writ petitioners in terms of the said order within 4 months from the date of Judgment.<br/> <br/>21. Two separate appeals were preferred there from, CA No. 31 of 1991, the appellants being Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Ministry of industries and the Secretary, Ministry of Industries, respondent Nos. 1 and 2 in the writ petition, and, CA No. 40 of 1991 the appellant being the Bangladesh Steel and Engineering Corporation, respondent No. 3 in the writ petition. Both the appeals have been heard together and will be disposed of by this common Judgment.<br/> <br/>22. The writ petition was filed with the averments, <em>inter alia</em>, that respondent Nos. 2-4 herein constituted a partnership firm in 1950 under the name and style of M/s Md. Masood Reza &amp; Co Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 with some other persons constituted another partnership firm in 1956 under the name and style of M/s. Epak Traders. There was a third partnership firm between respondent Nos. 2-4 and the other partners of M/s Epak Traders under the name and style of MIS Quality iron &amp; Steel Co. On 31.3.70 respondent Nos. 2‑4 and the other partners of AVS Epak Traders and MIS. Quality Iron &amp; Steel Company transferred the aforesaid partnership assets and liabilities to respondent No. 1 M/s Dhaka Steel Works Ltd., the Company, which was a Private Limited Company incorporated on 21.4.64 and of which respondent Nos. 2‑4 were shareholders and directors. On 31.3.70 the said two partnership firms were dissolved. On 24.5.70 the Company was converted into a Public Limited Company and was incorporated as such. Respondent Nos. 24 continued to be the shareholders and directors of the Company and they have been/are Bangladeshi nationals. The Company has 2,48,724 paid‑up shares of Tk. 10.00 each, the holders of which are all Bangladeshi nationals and out of which shares some financial institutions in Bangladesh held in trust 1,23,174 shares under buy-back agreement. The Company had its own factory in Tongi Industrial Area. It owned the industrial enterprise. While the Company was in possession, control and management of its industrial enterprise and other properties, the Board of Directors and officers of the Company were forcibly dispossessed there from on 29.1.72 by some Government officials without lawful authority and the aforesaid properties were taken over by force.<br/> <br/>23. In exercise of the authority given by the Acting President's Notification No. Sec-XI/IM -35/71/17 dated 30.12.71 the Ministry of Industries took over the management of the dissolved partnership firms M/s. Epak Traders and M/s Quality Iron &amp; Steel Co. and also M/s Md. Masood Reza &amp; Co. by various Notifications dated 31.12.71, 18.2.72 and 7.3.72. In exercise of the same authority, respondent M/s Dhaka Steel Works Ltd., the Company, was taken over with all its assets and properties by the Ministry of Industries for management by Notification No. IA (237)/72‑492 dated 7‑3‑72, vide Annexure‑F to the writ petition.<br/> <br/>24. By subsequent Notification No.P/ST‑I/ 1852 dated 17.5.72 published in the Bangladesh Gazette on 18.5.72, vide Annexure‑H to the writ petition, the Ministry of Industries in purported exercise of powers conferred by clause (1) of Article 10 of PO No. 27 of 1972 established Bangladesh Steel Mills Corporation with immediate effect and provided that it shall have and exercise the powers of a corporation in r‑spect of, among others, the Company.<br/> <br/>25. From as early as on 4‑2‑72 respondent Nos. 2‑4 had been making representations against the taking over of their Company and its assets and properties and for release and restoration thereof. The respondents annexed copies of 20 such represen­tations of various dates from 4.2.72 to 21.10.75 in the writ petition as Annexure‑I series and averred that they received only two replies thereto dated 2.3.74 and 19.3.74 (Annexure-J and J(I)), asking them to submit their documents and stating that the prayer for release was under consideration. The respondents submitted all their documents.<br/> <br/>26. Upon such repeated representations an order of release was passed in respect of M/s Md. Masood Reza &amp; Co. which was published in the Bangladesh Gazette on 16.2.76, but the Notification was subsequently cancelled. The respondents filed Writ Petition No. 134 of 1976 for release of M/s Md. Masood Reza &amp; Co. and the High Court Division made the Rule absolute and the Govern­ment and the Corporation's appeals therefrom were dismissed by the Appellate Division whose Judgment is reported in <strong><em>30 DLR (AD) 10</em></strong>. It was held therein that M/s Md. Masood Reza &amp; Co not being an industrial enterprise and not being an abandoned property its placement under Article 10 of PO No. 27 of 1972 was without lawful authority and of no legal effect.<br/> <br/>27. The respondents thereafter made further representations, 43 are on record, to which only 4 replies were received.<br/> <br/>28. The respondents' prayer for release of the Company was considered by the Government and it was found that only 260 shares were abandoned and that its owners were all along present in Bangladesh. As the owners have been making representations for release since 1972 the high quarters of the Government ordered that the Company may be released in favour of the respondents. This order was approved of by the Secretary, Ministry of Industries on 20.1.76 and was further approved of by the then Adviser-in-Charge of the Ministry of Industries on 28.1.76. Upon the failure of the Government to honour its own decision the respondents were obliged to file the present Writ Petition No. 36 of 1987 after serving a notice of demand of justice.<br/> <br/>29. By filing a supplementary petition he respondents averred how they were unable to get copies of the Government order dated 28.1.76 and how they had to file a true copy thereof.<br/> <br/>30. The Government‑respondents in the writ petition, appellants herein in CA No.31 of 1991, filed an affidavit‑in‑opposition and as many as three supplementary affidavits-in-opposition.<br/> <br/>31. Their case was that after liberation the Company was found abandoned and so it was taken over by the Government (vide paragraphs 8, 9, 15 and 16 of the affidavit-in- opposition). Elaborating, it was stated that as the shareholders, directors, etc. of the Company were not available to manage, supervise and control it and as their whereabouts were also not known it was declared as an abandoned industrial unit "in terms of the provisions of PO No. 16 of 1972 and thereupon the Government took over the management and control of the same and the Board of Directors of the said M/s. Dhaka Steel Works Ltd. stood dissolved with the vesting of the Company in the Government. On promulgation of PO No. 27 of 1972 and in pursuance of the provisions of the said PO No. 27 of 1972 the Government by Notification No. P/ST‑ 1/1982 dated 17.5.72 set up Bangladesh Steel Mills Corporation and placed M/s. Dhaka Steel Works Ltd. along with other industrial undertakings for its control and management" (<em>vide</em> paragraph 5(g) of the supplementary affidavit-in-opposition). While the Company was under the management of the said Corporation respondent Nos. 2-4 and 4 others made a prayer for release of the Company on 27.8.75 whereupon without necessary verification of the nationality and antecedents of the claimants and of the overall shareholding position of the Company the matter was placed with the then Secretary and Adviser-in-Charge, Ministry of Industries who in good faith consented to the proposal for release of the shares to Bangladeshi shareholders, but the decision could not be given effect to in view of the fact that the Co‑ordination and Control Cell for National Security under the President's Secretariat took a decision to the effect that "abandoned properties, movable or immovable, should not be released, leased out or disinvested till the work of the said Cell is completed". As per queries of the said Co‑ordination Cell the Ministry of Home Affairs confirmed the Bangladeshi nationality of 13 claimants- shareholders and submitted verification report of 5 persons only but nothing was said about the remaining 8 shareholders of which 3 were deceased. It was decided in November 1984 by the CMLA's Secretariat that the Company along with other units will be disinvested on condition that the Bangladeshi owners would be required to buy back their own shares at book value and the abandoned shares at market value. An evaluation of the assets and liabilities of the Company was made and a Scrutiny Committee was formed which accepted 1,10,000 shares as Bangladeshi shares out of a total of 2,48,724 shares, but the same represented only 44% of the total shareholdings. The Scrutiny Committee found that the remaining 1,23,174 shares were held by banks and financial institutions, which covered about 50% of the total shares and that 15,500 shares (6% of total shareholding) were clearly and absolutely abandoned shares. The Government insisted on producing no‑objection certificate from the banks and financial institutions but the respondents failed to do so. At a meeting of the Working Group on Disinvestment held on 8.5.88 it was decided that unless the respondents proved their title to the shares held by the banks and financial institutions the question of disinvestment of their shares did not arise, but the respondents failed to prove their ownership of the said shares. As such the question of disinvestment does not arise. As far as the Government Order dated 28.1.76 was concerned it was contended that it was an internal privileged document and the respondents could not have any manner of access to the same.<br/> <br/>32. Respondent No. 3 in the writ petition, Bangladesh Steel and Engineering Corporation (appellant in CA No. 40 of 1991 herein) also filed an affidavit‑in‑opposition more or less in the same terms. The respondents filed affidavits‑in‑reply to each of the affidavits‑in‑ opposition reiterating their contentions.<br/> <br/>33. Upon the contentions raised by both sides the High Court Division dealt with the nationality of the shareholders of the Company and their availability in Bangladesh for management at the relevant time. It held that the holders of 50% shares, namely, the banks and financial institutions are in Bangladesh and they are, therefore, Bangladeshi shareholders. The High Court Division relied upon the Government notings for the purpose of drawing a conclusion that only 260 shares were abandoned. It then found that the Bangladeshi shareholders were available for management at the relevant time. It therefore held that the Company could not be taken over as an abandoned property, that the application of PO No.16 of 1972 was unauthorised from the very beginning and that all subsequent actions taken thereafter on the basis of the unauthorised decision were also unauthorised. The High Court Division also held that the appellant in CA No. 40 of 1991 had no <em>locus standi</em> to question the claim of the respondents for release of the Company. The Rule was made absolute in the terms stated earlier.<br/> <br/>34. Leave was granted in CA No. 31 of 1991 to consider the appellants' submission that the management of the Company having been taken over in exercise of the authority given by President’s Order No. Sec‑XI/14‑35/71‑17 dated 30.12.71, the industrial enterprise was an abandoned property under PO No. 16 of 1972 and the same having been placed under the appellant in CA No. 40 of 1991, all the shares of the said industrial enterprise stood vested in the Government free from any trust, mortgage, etc. under, Articles 4 and 10(1 A) of PO No. 27 of 1972. Hence the Company can only be disinvested under P0 No. 27 of 1972 and the High Court Division erred in not considering the implications of Articles 4 and 10(l A) of PO No. 27 of 1972. Leave was also granted to consider whether the High Court Division erred in holding that the majority of the shareholders is Bangladeshi and as such it was not an abandoned property. It was lastly submitted that as according to the requirements of the Working Group the claimants have to prove their right and title over the shares held by the banks and financial institutions and as the respondents failed to do so the question of disinvestment of their shares did not arise.<br/> <br/>35. Leave was additionally granted in CA No. 40 of 1991 to consider the appellant's submission that the High Court Division erred in holding that die appellant had no <em>locus standi</em> to challenge the respondents' claim of release of the Company.<br/> <br/>36. The stand of the appellants in the High Court Division was that the industrial enterprise of the Company having been found abandoned after liberation was taken over by the Government, that as the shareholders, directors, etc. of the Company were not available to manage, supervise and control it and as their whereabouts were also not known it was declared as an abandoned unit "in terms of the provisions of PO No. 16 of 1972 and thereupon the Government took over the management and control of the same".<br/> <br/>37. In the High Court Division the appellants apparently ascribed the abandoned character of the property in question to the defining part of the definition of abandoned property in Article 2(1) of P.O. No. 16 of 1972 which is as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"2. In this Order, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context:<br/>(1) "Abandoned Property" means any property owned by any person who is not present in Bangladesh or whose whereabouts are not known or who has ceased to occupy, supervise or manage in person his property. ...........”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>and it is the burden of the Judgment of the High Court Division that the Company does not answer the said definition of abandoned property.<br/> <br/>38. The learned Additional Attorney‑General appearing for the appellants in CA No. 31 of 1991, now makes a radical departure from the stand so far taken by the appellants and submits for the first time that the property in question answers the second inclusive definition of abandoned property in Article 2(1) (ii) of PO No. 16 of 1972, namely:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"(ii) any property taken over under the Bangladesh (Taking Over of Control and Management of Industrial and Commercial Concerns) Order, 1972 (Acting President's Order No. 1 of 1972) “. .. ..............”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>39. We take it, therefore, that it is no longer the case of the appellants that the property in question answers the defining part of the definition of abandoned property in Article 2(1). According to the appellants, it attracts only the inclusive definition in Article 2(1) (ii).<br/> <br/>40. In an expropriatary legislation where by mere rule of thumb a property eschews to the State, the expropriating authority will be bound by its own stand. Also it is a cardinal principle of interpretation of expropriatary statutes that it should be strictly construed. The scope of an expropriatary legislation ought not to be extended beyond what is clearly and expressly indicated by its terms. <strong><em>See Palani Goundan Vs. Peria Goundan, AIR 1941 (Mad) 158</em> </strong><em>per</em><strong> Patanjali Shastri, J.</strong> Also, that interpretation of an expropriatary statute should be accepted which puts the least burden on the expropriated owner. See <strong><em>The State of Madhya Pradesh &amp; others Vs. Vishnu Prasad Sharma and ors, AIR </em>1966 (SC) 1593.</strong><br/> <br/>41. The learned Additional Attorney‑General now contends that Notification No. 1A(237)/72‑492 dated 7.3.72 (Annexure‑F to the writ petition) by which the Company including all its properties and assets were taken over for management by the Ministry of Industries was issued mistakenly under the authority of the Acting President's Order No. Sec‑XI/lM‑35/71/17 dated 30.12.71. It was actually issued under the authority of APO No. 1 of 1972. As such the Company and its assets and properties became an abandoned property under Article 2(1) (ii) of PO No. 16 of 1972.<br/> <br/>42. In support of his contention, the learned Additional Attorney‑General submits, first, that APO No. 1 of 1972 was neither expressly nor impliedly repealed by PO No. 16 of 1972 and therefore on 7.3.72 the Government had authority to take action under APO No.1 of 1972, secondly, materials exist to show that on 7.3.72 the Government had validly, exercised its power under APO No. 1 of 1972 and thirdly, if a power exists to do the act then invocation of a wrong provision of law will not invalidate the action.<br/> <br/>43. There seems to be good ground for upholding the learned Additional Attorney-General's first branch of submission.<br/> <br/>44. A brief narration of the history of evolution of this branch of expropriatary legislation will be useful. Acting President's Order No. IM‑35/71‑13 dated 26.12.71 which is the first legislation enabling the taking over of certain concerns for management was originally as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Whereas owners and top management of many industrial concerns, commercial firms and insurance companies have left Bangladesh and are not available;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Whereas in the interest of the country's economy it is essential that these industrial concerns, commercial firms and insurance companies are immediately put back into operation;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Now, therefore, I, Syed Nazrul Islam, Acting President of the People's Republic of Bangladesh hereby authorise the Ministry of Commerce to take over the management of, and operate those concerns, firms and companies either directly or through the appointment of administrators or otherwise, and generally conduct all ancillary matters and to carry out such other functions relating thereto as may be necessary from time to time."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>45. By Notification No. Sec‑XI/IM‑35/71/17 dated 30.12.71, the words 'the Ministry of Commerce and "the Ministry of Industries and Natural Resources" were substituted for the words "the Ministry of Commerce", but the relevant Ministries had been wrongly quoting this last Notification dated 30.12.71, as in the present case, as the source of their authority in taking over management of various concerns.<br/> <br/>46. APO No. 1 of 1972 was promulgated on 3‑1‑72. Article 6(1) thereof repealed the Acting President's Order No. IM‑35/71/13 dated 26.12.71 and Article 6(2) provided that notwithstanding the repeal, all notifications issued under the said Order shall be deemed to have been issued under the relevant provisions of this Order.<br/> <br/>47. PO No.16 of 1972, the comprehensive law of abandoned property, was promulgated on 26.2.72 and Article 2(l) (i) thereof provided that any property taken over by APO No. 1 of 1972 will be included in the definition of abandoned property.<br/> <br/>48. The Notification taking over the Company with all its properties and assets came on 7‑3‑72, after PO No. 16 of 1972 was promulgated, The learned Additional Attorney-General submits that PO No. 16 of 1972 did not either expressly or', impliedly repeal APO No. 1 of 1972. It was a continuing legislation and on 7.3.72 it was still permissible to act under APO No.1 of 1972. K. Khandker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, learned Advocate for the respondents, submits on the other hand, that APO No. 1 of 1972 stood impliedly repealed by PO No. 16 of 1972 and relies upon the case of <strong><em>Chairman, Bangladesh Steel Mills Corporation Vs, Md. Masood Reza &amp; others, 30 DLR (AD) </em></strong>169 in support of his submission.<br/> <br/>49. It is patent, first, that APO No.1 of 1972 was not expressly repealed by PO No.16 of 1972, Secondly, the doctrine of implied repeal cannot also be invoked by applying the rule of exhaustion. PO No. 16 of 1972 did not completely exhaust the scope of operation of APO No. 1 of 1972. In fact, the scope of operation of APO No. 1 of 1972 is wider than that of PO No. 16 of 1972. APO No. 1 of 1972 applies in three situations:<br/>(1) Where the owners, directors or managers, or the majority of them, or any industrial or commercial concern have left Bangladesh, or<br/>(2) are not available to control and manage the concern, or<br/>(3)where, in the opinion of the Government of Bangladesh, the owners or directors of any industrial or commercial concern cannot be allowed, in the public interest, to control and manage the concern.<br/> <br/>50. The first and second situations in PO No. 16 of 1972 are restricted to "owners" only but in PO No. 1 of 1972 it applies to owners, directors or managers or the majority of them.<br/> <br/>51. The third situation does not apply to PO No.16 of 1972 and Mr. Khandker Mahbubuddin Ahmed has been constrained to admit that APO No. 1 of 1972 is still a continuing law at least in respect of the third situation.<br/> <br/>52. Thirdly, if APO No.1 of 1972 was repealed legislation on and from 26.2.72, then it could not have been amended on 15.12.72 by PO No. 151 of 1972. Fourthly, Article 47(2) of the Constitution provides that "Notwithstanding anything contained in this Constitution the laws specified in the First Schedule (including any amendment of any such law) shall continue to have full force and effect and these laws were protected from being declared unconstitutional. APO No.1 of 1972 is one of such legislations specified in the First Schedule. It shall therefore "continue to have full force and effect", i.e., it is a continuing legislation and it will continue to be in the statute book until repealed. Lastly, Article 2(1)(ii) of PO No. 16 of 1972 (quoted earlier) no doubt speaks of any property "taken over" under APO No. 1 of 1972 but the words "taken over' cannot in the present context be taken to be a past participle and cannot be meant to refer to past action and not to any action in future. It refers to both, those already taken over and those that may be taken over in future.<br/> <br/>53. In the case relied upon by Mr. Khandker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, <strong>30 <em>DLR (AM </em>169</strong>, it was not held that APO No. 1 of 1972 was impliedly repealed by PO No. 16 of 1972 since it was "not necessary to hold" so. But certain observations were made therein which had the effect of so holding and in view of what we have discussed above, we now hold that PO No. 16 of 1972 did not expressly or impliedly repeal APO No. 1 of 1972.<br/> <br/>54. Having thus liberated the appellants from the fetters on the application of APO No. 1 of 1972 after 26‑2‑1972, we may now consider the second and third branches of the submissions of the learned Additional Attorney‑General.<br/> <br/>55. While analyzing the scopes of application of APO No. 1 of 1972 and PO No. 16 of 1972, we have seen that APO No. 1 of 1972 applies in three situations which we need not reiterate. The learned Additional Attorney-General submits that the first and third situations do not apply in the present case, but he is emphatic in his assertion that the second situation, namely, when the owners, directors or managers, or the majority of them, of any industrial or commercial concern are not available to control and manage the concern, applies on all fours in the present case and he refers to various statements in the appellants' affidavits-in-opposition invoking the facts covered by the second situation and also refers to the respondents own writ petition and Annexures containing admissions that they could not manage their concerns for a certain time after liberation.<br/> <br/>56. Acting President's Order No. IM-35171-13 dated 26.12.71 applies where the "owners and top management" "have left Bangladesh and are not available". In the second situation under APO No. 1 of 1972, the availability is not simpliciter, it must be an availability "to control and manage the concern". So although it is a question of availability in both cases, the availability in APO No.1 of 1972 is for a specific purpose. The two situations are dissimilar. If a concern is taken over under the Acting President's Order dated 26.12.71, all that the owners and top management have to prove to the satisfaction of the authorities is that on the date of Notification they did not leave Bangladesh and are available. But when a concern is taken over for management under APO NO. 1 of 1972 under the second situation, the owners, directors, etc. have to show that they were available on the date of Notification "to control and manage" their concern. The onus is heavier in APO No. 1 of 1972. The respondents submitted a number of representations to the authorities concerned that they were present in Bangladesh and were available when their concern was taken over. The learned Additional Attorney-General insists that mere availability is not enough, the availability must be "to control and manage" their concern. But that is a requirement of the second situation of APO No. 1 of 1972 and in the absence of a Notification under APO No. 1 of 1972 the respondents do not have to carry that much burden.<br/> <br/>57. Therefore, the scope of application of Acting President's Order No. IM‑35/71-13 dated 26.12.71 and the second situation of APO No. 1 of 1972 are, not co-extensive and interchangeable. The plea of mistake in invoking one provision for the other cannot be accepted.<br/> <br/>58. By PO No. 151 of 1972 APO No.1 of 1972 was amended with retrospective effect from 3‑1‑72 and the effect of the amendment was that no notification was necessary to take over a concern under APO No. 1 of 1972. The taking over is, effective from the moment the Government takes over and it may be argued that since the Government actually took over the management of the Company on 7.3.72, APO No. 1 of 1972 is attracted <em>ipso facto.</em><br/> <br/>59. The argument will have no legs to stand on. When the Company was taken over on 7.3.72, PO No. 16 of 1972 had come into operation from 26.2.72. Under PO No. 16 of 1972 the Government also had the power to take over any abandoned property without Notification in the Official Gazette. So whether a concern was taken over under APO No. 1 of 1972 or under PO No. 16 of 1972 will remain a question of fact. The appellants in their affidavits-in-opposition have repeatedly asserted that the Company was declared as an abandoned unit "in terms of the provisions of PO No.16 of 1972" and thereupon the Government took over its management and control. Now they say it was taken over under APO No.1 of 1972. Which claim shall we sustain? It is not a question of acceptance and condonation of only one mistake, but a series of mistakes. The second and third branch of the learned Additional Attorney General's submission fails.<br/> <br/>60. Besides, PO No.151 of 1972 also added clause (2A) after Article 2, as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"(2A). The Government may, from time to time, publish for general information lists Of industrial and commercial concerns taken over under this Order."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>This clause was inserted to keep a separate list of concerns taken over under APO No. 1 of 1972 so that concerns taken over directly under PO No. 16 of 1972 are not mixed up. The learned Additional Attorney‑General did not produce any list to show that the Company was taken over under APO No. 1 of 1972.<br/> <br/>61. We have therefore no manner of doubt that the Company was taken over for management by Notification dated 7.3.72 under a repealed legislation, that there is neither any legal basis nor any material to show that it was actually taken over under APO No.1 of 1972 and that the appellant's case that it was taken over as an abandoned property under PO No. 16 of 1972 is itself abandoned. The plea of mistake is a belated plea, not pleaded in the four affidavits- in- opposition, leave petition and concise statement and even no leave was granted on this plea. The plea does not bear scrutiny and it falls flat.<br/> <br/>62. The Company, therefore, was not an abandoned property within the meaning of Article (1) (ii) of PO No. 16 of 1972.<br/> <br/>63. The second submission of the lewd Additional Attorney‑General is that when the Company was placed under erstwhile Bangladesh Steel Mills Corporation by a Notification dated 17.5.72, vide Annexure‑H to the writ petition, N legal implication was that the said Corporation “shall have and exercise the powers of a Corporation under this Order" in respect of this industrial enterprise. In other words, the Corporation was to supervise and co‑ordinate the activities, business and affairs of this enterprise. No other implication was there. But PO No.27 of 1972 was amended o 15.12.72 by PO No. 153 of 1972 which added a now clause (IA) after clause (1) of Article 10 as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"(IA) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, an industrial enterprise, placed under any Corporation by an order notified in the official Gazette under sub‑clause (d) of clause (1) of Article 10, and all shares or other proprietary interest in such industrial enterprise shall be deemed to have always vested in &amp; Government and no such order shall be challenged on the ground that the industrial enterprise or the shares or interest therein had not vested in the Government, or that the industrial enterprise, or any share or interest therein, was not liable to be vested in the Government."<br/>This was given retrospective effect from 26.3.72.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>64. He submits that the effect of this amendment was that on and from 17.5.72, the date of Notification of placement, all shares or other proprietary interest in the Company shall be deemed to have always vested in the Government and no order of placement shall be challenged on the ground that the industrial enterprise or the shares or interest therein had not vested in the Government, or that the industrial enterprise, or any share or interest therein, was not liable to be vested in the Government.<br/> <br/>65. Therefore, he submits that regardless of the question whether the Company and its properties and assets were abandoned property or not the vesting of its shares in the Government is complete after its placement under the Corporation and the vesting is unchallengeable.<br/> <br/>66. The learned Additional Attorney‑General also draws our attention to the subsequent amendment made in Article 4 of PO No.27 of 1972 by Ordinance No. XXV of 1976 which was promulgated on 17.4.76 and which was given effect to from the 1st July, 1976, as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"4.(1) All such shares and other proprietory interests in each of the scheduled industrial enterprises, and all such industrial enterprises placed under a Corporation by, or by an order under clause (1) of Article 10 and all shares and proprietory and other interests, as have not already vested in the Government by or under any law for the time being in force, shall, by virtue of this Article and without any further proceeding or formality, stand vested in, and allotted to, the Government free of any trust, mortgage, charge, lien, interest or other encumbrance whatsoever,<br/>(a) in the case of a scheduled industrial enterprise, on the commencement of this Order, and<br/>(b) in the case of an industrial enterprise placed under a Corporation by order under clause (1) of Article 10, on the date on which it is so placed;<br/>and subject to the provisions of clause (2), the Government shall, as from such commencement or date, be the sole shareholder in, or owner of such industrial enterprises."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>67. He submits that in addition to Article 10 (1A) under the amended Article 4(1) also the shares and other proprietary interests of the Company, if not already vested in the Government, stand vested in and allotted to the Government free of any trust, mortgage, etc. without any further proceeding or formality. In such circumstances, he submits, the only course left open for the Government to give back the industrial enterprise to its original owners is not by way of release but by way of disinvestment under Article 4(2) of PO No. 27 of 1972. By referring to the appellants' affidavits‑in‑opposition he submits that as the shareholding position of the Company is such that the respondents are still unable to prove their major shareholding interest in the Company, the question of disinvestment also does not arise. His grievance is that the High Court Division did not consider the implications of Articles 4 and 10(1A).<br/> <br/>68. Mr. Khandker Mahbubuddin Ahmed submits, on the other hand, that under Article 10(1) (d) of PO No. 21 of 1972 only three classes of industrial enterprises could be placed under a Corporation of which enterprises vested in the Government under PO No. 16 of 1972 was one, but since the Company did not answer this description it was not liable to be placed at all under the Bangladesh Steel Mills Corporation. As such the question of vesting under Article 10(IA) as well as under Article 4(1) does not arise, he submits. He relies upon <strong>30 <em>DLR (AD) </em>169</strong> in support of his submission.<br/> <br/>69. Article 10(1)(d) of PO No. 27 of 1972, as amended uptodate, stands as follows :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“10(1) On the commencement of this Order, there shall be established the following Corporations<br/>(d) (i). Bangladesh Steel and Engineering Corporation, (ii) Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation, each of which shall have and exercise the powers of a Corporation under this Order in respect of such industrial enterprises, including enterprises owned wholly or partly by the Government under the Bangladesh Abandoned Property (Control, Management and Disposal) Order, 1972 (PO No. 16 of 1972), or owned or managed by any statutory corporation, as the Government may, by order published in the official Gazette, place under it."<br/>(It may be mentioned that this Article was wrongly quoted in <strong><em>30 DLR (AD) 169</em></strong> at page 187).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>70. From a plain reading of Article 10(1) (d) it is quite obvious that industrial enterprises of all descriptions could be placed under the Corporations named therein and specific mention was made of only two categories of enterprises which could also be placed under a Corporation, namely, (i) industrial enterprises owned wholly or partly by the Govern­ment under PO No. 16 of 1972 or (ii) owned or managed by any statutory Corporation.<br/> <br/>71. In <strong>30 <em>DLR (AD) </em>10</strong> it has been held that only three categories of industrial enterprises could be placed under a Corporation, namely,<br/>(i) those which are owned wholly or partly by the Government, or<br/>(ii) vested in the Government under PO No. 16 of 1972, or<br/>(iii) are owned and managed by a statutory corporation.<br/> <br/>72. Upon a fuller scrutiny it seems that the above view does not truly accord with the provisions of Article 10(1) (d) and restricting the categories in the manner aforesaid was not quite right. The plain meaning of Article 10(1)(d) is that each Corporation mentioned therein shall have and exercise the powers of a Corporation under this Order in respect of such, industrial enterprises, as the Government may, by order published in the official Gazette, place under it. Such industrial enterprises may include two categories, namely-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(i)  industrial enterprises owned wholly or partly by the Government under PO No. 16 of 1972, or<br/>(ii) owned or managed by any statutory corporation.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Article 10(1) (d) cannot be interpreted to mean that apart from the aforesaid two categories no other industrial enterprise can be placed under a Corporation. There is a general power of placement of any industrial enterprise, followed by a special power of placement of two kinds of industrial enterprises. We, therefore, think that the view expressed in <strong><em>30 DLR (AD) 10</em></strong> needs modification to the extent as aforesaid.<br/> <br/>73. The learned Additional Attorney‑General's argument is that since any industrial enterprise can be placed by the Government under a Corporation it is immaterial now as to whether the Company was an abandoned property or not. Once it is placed under a Corporation, he submits, the vesting of its shares or other proprietary interests in the Government is complete and its abandoned character is a question of the past. In the Notification placing the Company under Bangladesh Steel Mills Corporation, Annexure‑H to the writ petition, it was nowhere mentioned that the enterprise was being placed under a Corporation as an abandoned property. In fact, there is no mention as to the character of the Company in the Notification itself. As such he submits that the placing took place under the Government's general power of placement of all kinds of industrial enterprises and the resultant vesting is irrevocable and immune from challenge.<br/> <br/>74. This argument is attractive, but it does not bear scrutiny.<br/> <br/>75. First, Article 9 of PO No.27 of 1972 belies the submission of Attorney-General. Article 9 stands thus-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"9. The Government shall pay in respect of industrial enterprises, shares or proprietory interests vested in the Government under this order other than those which had already vested in the Government by or under any other law for  the time being in force, such compensation as may be determined by the Government:        </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>Provided that where the compensation is payable in respect of any share it shall not exceed the paid‑up value of such share."                           </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>76. When the Government places an industrial enterprise under a Corporation and such enterprise is neither an abandoned property nor owned by a statutory corporation, the vesting of its shares or other proprietory interests takes place for the first    time under PO No. 27 of 1972. This is what may be called the Government's general power of placement of any kind of industrial enterprise under a Corporation. Not being vested in the Government before its placement under a Corporation, the Government "shall pay" compensation to its former shareholders. If no compensation is payable, then industrial enterprise must have been placed under a Corporation not under the general power of placement, but under the power of placement of abandoned properties or those owned by a statutory corporation. It does not matter whether specific mention of the character of the industrial enterprise was made in the Notification or not. Once it is claimed that an industrial enterprise was placed under a Corporation under the general power of placement payment of compensation becomes due. It is not the case of the appellants that they were contemplating payment of compensation to the shareholders of the Company. It was taken over as an abandoned property, treated as such and the placement was made not because it was just any industrial enterprise, but because it was an abandoned property. If it was merely an industrial enterprise, other than an abandoned property or owned by a Corporation, then it is not known whether the Government would have at all placed it under a Corporation. It is not the case of the appellants that all or bulk of the Steel industries were placed under the Corporation either by one Notification or gradually, regardless of their character.<br/> <br/>77. Secondly, the Company was being treated as an abandoned property from before its placement. From the various representations made by the respondents, vide Annexure‑I series to the writ petition, which were not controverted by the appellants, we find that the respondents filed an application under Article 15 of PO No. 16 of 1972 for release of their property early in 1972. One Mr. Jamiruddin Ahmed, the then Joint Secretary, Ministry of Industries heard the application of the Company on 6.5.72 and without giving a decision on the same the Company was placed under the Corporation by Notification dated 17.5.72. It is therefore clear that even before placement the Company was being treated as an abandoned property. In fact, it is the appellants' own case that the Company was an abandoned property. Now to say that it was placed under the Corporation not because it was an abandoned property but because of the Government’s general power of placement, is not acceptable to us.<br/> <br/>78. Thirdly, the writ petition and the affidavits‑in‑opposition are replete with instances of the Government's treating the property as an abandoned property even after its placing under the Corporation. To give an example, PO No.27 of 1972 was amended by Ordinance No. 1 of 1976 effective from 3.1.76, and a proviso was added to clause (1A) of Article 10 as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Provided that the Government may, at any time, transfer an industrial enterprise mentioned in this clause and all shares or other proprietory interest therein, in such manner and on such condition as it may deem fit, to the persons who owned such industrial enterprise and shares or interest before they were vested in the Government, if such persons are Bangalees and the industrial enterprise and the shares or interest therein were vested in the Government under the Bangladesh Abandoned Property (Control, Management and Disposal) Order, 1972 (PO) No. 16 of 1972), prior to the placement of the industrial enterprise under any Corporation, and on such transfer the industrial enterprise shall cease to be under the control of any Corpo­ration."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Plainly stated the proviso meant that the persons who owned an industrial enterprise and shares or interest therein before they were vested in the Government can get back their enterprise and shares or interest therein on the Government's terms and conditions if (i) they are Bangalees and (ii) the industrial enterprise and shares or interest therein were vested in the Government under PO No. 16 of 1972 prior to its placement under any Corporation.<br/> <br/>79. It is because of this amendment that an exercise was made in the high level of the Govern­ment and a decision was taken to release the company on 20/28‑1‑76 in favour of the respondents treating only 260 shares as abandoned. This decision however could not be given effect to as the aforesaid proviso was omitted by section 4(l)(b) of Ordinance No. XXV of 1976, with effect from 1.7.76. The Government notings on which respondents relied (Annexure-Y to the writ petition) became unenfor­ceable, as the learned Additional Attorney-General rightly contends, but these notings reveal at least, as the High Court Division rightly pointed out, that the Company was being treated as an abandoned property not only before its placement under the Corporation but also after it.<br/> <br/>80. It is therefore not permissible for the appellants now to say that while placing the Company under the Corporation the appellants were oblivious of the fact that it was an abandoned property and that it was only in exercise of their general power that the placement took place. The Company was clearly placed under a Corporation on being treated as an abandoned property. We have held that there was no basis for treating the Company as an abandoned property and therefore there was no basis for placing it under a Corporation treating it to be an abandoned property. Article 10(1) (d) could not be applied to the Company in the manner in which it was applied and therefore its placement under the Corporation was illegal.<br/> <br/>81. Article 10(1A) immunises an order of placement from challenge only on the ground that the industrial enterprise or the shares or interest therein had not vested in the Government or was not liable to be vested in the Government. That is not the basis of challenge in this case. The basis of challenge is that the industrial enterprise on its being treated as an abandoned property could not be placed under a Corporation under Article 10(1)(d) at all and that is a basis of challenge which is available to the respondents in spite of the bar of Article 10(1A).<br/> <br/>82. With regard to Article 4(1), as introduced by Ordinance No. XXV of 1976, there is a fresh vesting without any further proceeding or formality. But this vesting is also very much dependant upon the lawful placing of an industrial enterprise under a Corporation. Vesting is a consequence of placing. Placing is the cause, vesting is the consequence. If placing goes, vesting also falls through. So whether it is Article 10(1A) or Article 4(1), the result is the same. If there is a lawful placing, vesting takes place under Article 10(1A) and a double vesting takes place under Article 4(1). But if the placing itself was unlawful, the vesting did not take place, either under Article 10(1A) or under Article 4(1). The consequence may have a double protection, but if the cause is removed, no single protection is left.<br/> <br/>83. We must however sustain the further contention of the learned Additional Attorney­ General that the Government's notings dated 20‑1‑76 and 28‑1‑76, as furnished in Annexure‑Y to the writ petition, are not enforceable, because those were internal exercises of the Government and were never communicated to the respondents. No legal right can be founded on those notings. The respondents are not also supposed to obtain a copy thereof. Consequently we are unable to uphold that part of the order of the High Court Division which directs the appellants to implement the order dated 20.1.76 and 28.1.76 and to release the property of the respondents" in terms of the said order". The Government will now release the Company and the industrial enterprise in favour of the respondents treating only 15,500 shares as abandoned shares, as its own investigation has revealed, leaving it to the shareholders of the Company to sort out their own rights and liabilities <em>inter se. </em>The appellants are directed to do so within 3 months from date.<br/> <br/>84. We do not like to enter into the question as to whether the appellants in CA No. 40 of 1991 had the locus <em>standi </em>to agitate the question of release in view of the decision in these appeals.<br/> <br/>85. In the result, the appeals are dismissed subject to the modification of the direction as above without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong><u>Latifur Rahman J:</u></strong><br/> <br/>I have gone through the Judgments proposed to be delivered by my Lord the Chief Justice and my learned brother <strong>Mustafa Kamal J</strong>; I concur with the Judgment of my brother <strong>Mustafa Karnal J.</strong><br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><u><strong>Order of the Court</strong></u></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>By a majority decision the appeals are dismissed without any order as to costs, subject to the modification of the direction given by the High Court Division as above.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>
