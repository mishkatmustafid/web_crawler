The decree was passed by the Munsif, Chandpur, is T.S. No. 74 of 1975; it was affirmed in appeal by the Subordinate Judge; the High Court Division did not interfere with it in revi­sion.<br/> <br/>2. In the judgment of the courts below the suit property has been referred to, as residential "quarters". It is one of the flats of a building which was constructed by the Government of the then East Pakistan for providing residential accommodation to the displaced persons who had migrated from India, generally known as "Behari Refugees" The quarter was allotted under a Lease Agreement to respondent No. 2, Shamsuddin, in 1965 for his residence, but he immediately after taking possession entered into an Agreement with respondent No. 1, Ibrahim, to sell it on a consideration of Tk. 4000/- out of which he received Tk. 2000/- promising to execute the necessary sale-deed on receiving the balance; but he did not per­form his part of the contract whereupon respondent No. 1 filed the; suit seeking specific performance of the contract. The Government alone contested The suit taking the ground that under the terms and con­ditions of the Lease Agreement the allottee, respon­dent No. 2, did not acquire any right to transfer the quarter, that he left the quarter since 16 December 1971, as a result of which it fell vacant and was oc­cupied by unauthorised persons, who were evicted and it was then allotted to the widow of a freedom-fighter in March 1973 since when she has been in possession of it. The Agreement between the allot­tee, respondent No. 2 and respondent No. 1, it was contended, was void and inoperative and as such there was no question of its specific performance.<br/> <br/>3. Both the trial Court and the appellate Court concurrently found that the Agreement between re­spondent Nos. 1 and 2 was genuine, that respondent No. 2, the lessee, was in exclusive possession of the quarter and had a right to transfer it. The Learned Single Judge of the High Court Division in revision upheld the decree observing that respondent No. 2 had "transferable right" in the properly in spite of his Lease-Deed with the Government which showed his position as that of a mere "Licensee".<br/> <br/>4. Facts of the case are not disputed. The Lease Deed between the Government and respondent No. 2 is a "Standard Agreement for Allotment of Houses", dated 18 March 1965, made between the then Gov­ernment of East Pakistan and the allottee, Shamsud­din. The quarter was allotted to respondent No. 2, a displaced person from India, for a period of 99 years' lease for his own residence under certain conditions, such as, the allottee would pay monthly premium of Tk. 14/- for a period of 15 years to reach the total of Tk. 2700-/. He paid Tk. 180/-; the Agreement was registered on 9-4-65 whereupon he was put into possession. But he did not pay any further premium; on the contrary, within three months he entered into an Agreement with respondent No. 1 to sell it for a consideration of Tk. 4000/- out of which he received Tk 2000/- promising to execute a necessary kabala; but he neither received the balance nor executed the kabala. The quarter fell vacant during the war of liberation and was occupied by unauthorised persons and by evicting them the Government allotted it to respondent No. 3 on 14 March, 1973.<br/> <br/>5. The question is, whether respondent No. 2 had any right or authority to enter into the contract for sale of the quarter when he did not pay in full the premium of Tk. 2700/-. Mr. B. Hossain, learned Deputy Attorney-General, contends that the allottee had no "capacity" to enter into the contract for sale of the Government quarter as clause (7) of the Stan­dard Agreement stands in the way. It is quoted be­low: —<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"7. Until full payment of Rs 2700.00 (Ru­pees two thousand seven hundred) for the house has been made, the Second Party shall occupy the house as a mere licensee and shall not use it except for his/her residence only unless other­wise permitted in writing by the First Party."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>6. Mr. B. Hossain, contends that this clause 7 is one of the conditions of the Lease Agreement be­tween the Government and respondent No. 2, a "displaced person", and the condition is that unless the full payment of the premium is made the allottee will occupy the quarter as a mere "licensee". Learned Deputy Attorney-General argues that the expression 'Licensee' has been used just to show the allottees status and legal position and contends that a licens­ee's right has been given in s. 52 of the Easement Act, 1882. A licensee has got no interest in the land which he is simply permitted to possess by the grantor of the licence, that is, by the owner of the land. Obviously he has no right to transfer the prop­erty and, consequently, his contract for sale of the quarter is void, Mr. B. Hossain further contends.<br/> <br/>7. The learned Single Judge of the High Court Division has, however, treated the expression "licensee" in clause (7) to be a misnomer examining the question from a different angle of view. The question considered by the learned Single Judge is whether the Standard Agreement between the Gov­ernor of the then East Pakistan and the allottee was a lease-deed or a licence and upon examining its terms and conditions, and in view of the fact that the actual possession was delivered lo the allottee, the learned Single Judge interpreted the document and held it to be a 'lease' and not a 'licence' and that the lessee has got a right which is "heritable and transferable". This angle of view is found to be irrelevant in this case. For, there is no dispute that the Agreement between the Governor and the allottee is a Deed of Lease for 99 years; but the lease is on certain conditions one being clause (7). This clause says that the right of the lessee, unless he pays the premium in full, is that of a licensee. Since no particular meaning of li­cence has been given in the Lease-Deed it will have the same meaning as given in section 52 of the Easement Act and, according to this section, a li­censee has no right to transfer the immovable prop­erty for possession of which he has been granted the licence except to occupy it by permission of the grantor. By using the word 'licensee' in clause (7) the lessee's legal position has been explained, that is, until the full payment of the premium is made he will have no right to transfer the property. Instead of expressing this condition in a straightforward way, the Lease-Deed used the term "licensee". This expres­sion has created unnecessary complications. The Lease Deed is not in dispute, but one of its condition in clause (7) is a matter of consideration. The condi­tion is that the lessee, though put into possession of the quarter, got no right to transfer it till the full payment is made. This condition is found lo have been violated. It is true that the Lease-deed docs not contain any express provision prohibiting transfer, but the object and meaning of Clause (7) unerringly is that the right to transfer has been denied. The con­tract having been made by a person who had no right to transfer the land is invalid. The mere fact that the allottee was put into possession of the quarter for his own residence docs not confer upon him the right to transfer.<br/> <br/>8. Again, the contract for sale was made in 1965 but the suit for its specific performance was filed in 1975 during which period many things hap­pened. The allottee was not found in occupation of the quarter, nor his whereabouts were known, and consequently it went into unauthorised possession of some persons. In the circumstances, the Government was perfectly justified in treating it as vacant and al­lotting it to a deserving person. There was no neces­sity for formally cancelling the allotment.<br/> <br/>9. In the result, the appeal is allowed. The judgment and decree of the High Court Division is set aside and the suit is dismissed. No order as to costs.<br/> <br/><em>Ex parte</em> order passed by this Court on 26.11.87 is vacated in respect of respondent No.1 only.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
