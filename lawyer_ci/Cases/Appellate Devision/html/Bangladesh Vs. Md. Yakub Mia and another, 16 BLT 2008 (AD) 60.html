Tafazzul Islam J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This appeal by leave arises out of the judgment and order dated 23.11.1999 passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 2060 of 1993 making the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>2. The respondent No.1 filed the above writ petition calling in question the judgment and order dated 10.11.93 passed by the 1st Court of Settlement, Dhaka in Settlement Case No. 10 of 1988 by which the enlisting of House No. 11/5, Block-F Joint Quarter, Mohammadpur, Dhaka in the "Ka" list of the abandoned building, was upheld. In the writ petition it was stated, inter alia, that the above building was allotted to Md. Shafi by a registered lease deed dated 19.4.62; while in peaceful possession of the building Md. Shafi, on 08.01.1970 entered into an agreement with the respondent No.1 for sale of the building at a total consideration of Tk. 9,750/- out of which the respondent No.1 paid to Md. Shafi a sum of Tk. 7,000/- as earnest money and on the same very day Md. Shafi handed over possession of the said building to him; Md. Shafi did not comply with his part of the contract though the respondent No. 1 complied with his part of the contract and so he filed Title Suit No. 138 of 1976 against Md. Shafi seeking specific performance of the contract in the 1st Court of Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge) Dhaka and he after obtaining decree on 26.6.78 put the said decree in execution by filing a Title Execution Case No. 37 of 1978 and got the sale deed executed and registered in his favour, the Government then filed Miscellaneous Case STO. 248 of 1986 under Order 9, Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure praying for setting aside the aforesaid ex parte decree which was allowed on condition that the Government will pay Tk. 30,000/- and in case of default the said miscellaneous case shall and dismissed;  the  Government having died to comply with the said condition the Miscellaneous case stood dismissed for default the respondent No.1 had been in possession of the disputed building since the date of agreement dated 8.1.70 and being in possession he got his name mutated and has been paying municipal taxes and other bills but even then above building was listed as an abandoned property by the Gazette Notification published on 23.9.86; the Court of Settlement by judgment and order 10.11.93 dismissed the above case. The respondent No. 1 of the writ petition, who is the appellant herein, contested the said writ petition without filing any affidavit-in-opposition. The High Court Division after hearing made the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>3. Leave was granted to consider the submissions that the High Court Division not being the court of appeal erred in law in interfering with the findings of fact arrived at by the Court of Settlement and that during the relevant period the whereabouts of the original owner of the above building not being known and the said original owner also having failed to look after and possess the building, the Court of Settlement rightly found that the above building duly vested in the government and the High Court Division erred in law in shifting the onus on the Government to show that the suit property is an abandoned property even though the enlisting of the above building in the Gazette Notification published on 23.09.1986 itself is proof of its abandoned character.<br/> <br/>4. The learned counsel appearing for the appellant submits that the High Court Division not being the court of appeal, can not interfere with the findings of fact arrived by the Court of Settlement which is the final authority to decide the  character of the property; the decree for specific performance of contract and the deed of sale pursuant to the said decree being hit by the provisions of P.O. 16 of 1972 the High Court Division erred in law in making the rule absolute; the whereabouts of the original owner-not being known during the relevant period and the original owner having failed to look after and possess the above building personally at the relevant time the Court of Settlement rightly held that the above building duly vested to the government; the High Court Division erred in law in shifting the onus on the Government to prove that the property was an abandoned property specially when the enlisting and publication of the said building in the Gazette Notification published on 23.09.1986 conclusive proof of its abandoned character.<br/> <br/>5. The learned counsel appearing for the respondent No.1 on the other handed submits that the Government, the appellant herein, did never serve any notice either upon the respondent No.1 or upon the original owner of the building for surrendering their possession declaring the building as abandoned properly and there was also no material before the Court of Settlement to show that the possession of the building has been taken over by the appellant at any 4ime in compliance of section 5(1) of the Ordinance No. 54 of 1985 or P.O. No. 16 of 1972 and further the respondent No. 1 along with his vendor, was also in physical possession of the building and was never dispossessed from the building and still is in possession of the same on mutating his name in the Government Khatian and has been paying municipal taxes, gas bills and so the decision of the High Court Division does not call for any interference.<br/> <br/>6. The High Court Division made the Rule absolute holding as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"On perusal of the Judgment of the Court of Settlement we find that while disposing the petition of the writ petitioner it compared the signature of the Vendor appearing in the original lease deed with the signature of agreement of sale as if deciding the Title of the parties. The Court of Settlement without considering the basic aspect of that is to see as to whether the property is an abandoned property under the provision of P.O. 16 of 1972 and whether the suit property under the provision of Ordinance No. 54 of 1985. It appears that the respondent Government appearing before the Court of Settlement could not produce any materials to show that the original allottee being a non­local did anything prejudicial to the war of liberation of Bangladesh. There is also no material before the court of Settlement that the possession of the property was taken by the Government under Section 5(1) of the Ordinance No. 54 of 1985. The court of Settlement is not a Civil Court to decide title".</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>7. However, as it appears the Court of Settlement found that the respondent No. 1 did not possess the vital documents of title i.e. the original allotment letter dated 16.9.1961, registered lease agreement dated 19.4.1963 and letter of delivery of possession dated 26.6.62. Before the Court of Settlement the learned lawyer for the respondent No. 1 tried to meet the said position by contending that at the time of execution of the agreement for sale the original owner supplied to the respondent No. 1 merely the photostat copies of the aforesaid documents but the Court of Settlement did not accept the above contention as at the relevant time i.e. in the year 1970, there was no photostat machine in the country and moreover on perusal of the said photostat copies the Court of Settlement found that those were made from the office Copies and Duplicate Registered Lease Agreement preserved in the office-file of the Deputy Commissioner of Housing and Settlement Department and the photostat copies filed by the respondent No. 1 contained the words "O/C" and "Duplicate" and further the note dated 27.09.83 at para-4 of the page-2 of the file of the above building supports this and the respondent No.1 also submitted the Photostat copy of the 1st page of the same file. Moreover on perusal of the aforesaid officefile the Court of Settlement found that Md. Shafi signed each and every document in English including the registered lease deed whereas he executed the alleged bainanama in Urdu which made the Court of Settlement to hold that the alleged bainanama is a forged and anti-dated and the respondent No.1, thus obtained the exparte decree on the basis of the same and further there is no evidence that Md. Shafin was present in Bangladesh after the 25th March, 1971 and moreover till the date of judgment i.e. 10.11.1993, there was also no trace of him.<br/> <br/>8. It further appears that the scope of certiorari applying which the High Court Division made the Rule absolute is very limited and moreover the High Court Division did not advert to the finding of the Court of Settlement regarding absence of original documents and the absence of Md. Shafi in the Bangladesh after 25th March 1971. So the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division cannot be sustained.<br/> <br/>9. Accordingly the appeal is allowed and the judgment and order dated 23.11.1999 passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 2060 of 1993 is set aside. There is no order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
