No. 478 of 1968 decided by a Bench of the High Court Division, Dhaka (Mr. Justice Ranadhir Sen and Mr. Justice Aminur Rahman Khan) on 12th April 1982.<br/> <br/>2. Plaintiff- respondent filed Title Suit No. 95 of 1965 in the Subordinate Judge, 3rd Court, Dhaka for declaration that the assessment of rent under the provisions of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 in respect of the Schedule land is without juris­diction and in violation of the agreement between plaintiff and defendant - Government. Plaintiff also prayed for refund of Tk. 95, 0007- paid by the plain­tiff as arrear rents etc. It was averred by the plaintiff that the suit land was acquired by the Government under the provisions of the Emergency Requisition of Property Act, 1948 in favour of the plaintiff to whom delivery of possession was made in terms of a bilateral agreement between the Government and plaintiff. Government received the full amount of compensation paid to the owner with capitalised val­ue from the plaintiff. Since then plaintiff has been carrying on production of textiles in the mills esta­blished thereon. Plaintiff claimed that the aforesaid agreement contained no term for payment or assess­ment of rent for the suit land. In 1962 plaintiff, however, received a notice from the Revenue Circle Officer as per Memo. No.1207-E 80/58 dated 28.11.60 issued by the Board of Revenue. The Reve­nue Officer was alleged to have illegally assessed rents under section 50 of the Slate Acquisition and Tenancy Act which, according to the plaintiff, was illegal as the lands have been delivered to him rent free and were, therefore, not liable 'to any assessment of rent. Land was shown rent free in the khatian. Plaintiff objected to the impugned rent under section 19(1) of the aforesaid Act which was disallowed. Plaintiff preferred appeal to the Special Judge who remanded the same resulting in only a small reduc­tion of rent. It was also alleged that the Revenue au­thority gave retrospective effect to the order of the Board of Revenue, by assessing arrear rents.<br/> <br/>3. Defendant-Government, appellant before us, appeared and contested the suit by filing a written statement contending, inter alia, that the suit was speculative, bad for want of notice under section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure and also that the plaintiff accepted the assessment of rent and accord­ingly made payment of the same voluntarily. Fur­ther, plaintiffs claim was by waiver, acquiescence, estoppel and limitation.<br/> <br/>4. Trial Court, on declaring that the lands in question arc not liable to assessment of rent decreed the suit. It was also ordered that the plaintiff be re­funded the amount of rent already paid to the Govern­ment. Government preferred the aforesaid First Ap­peal which was heard by a Bench of the High Court Division, Dhaka on 12th April 1982.<br/> <br/>5. On the dismissal of aforesaid appeal by the learned Judges of the High Court Division the Gov­ernment moved this Court and obtained Special leave to consider whether, in view of the provisions of section 22 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 the learned Judges of the High Court Division were wrong in holding that the lands in question were not liable to assessment of rent.<br/> <br/>6. Mr. A.W. Bhuiyan Additional Attorney-General, appearing on behalf of the Government, submitted that having regard to the provisions con­tained in section 22 of the State Acquisition and Te­nancy Act no exemption from payment of rent can ever be made, as under terms of this section, all lands acquired under the Act were subjected to pay­ment of rent.<br/> <br/>7. On the other hand, plaintiff-respondents' Counsel, Mr. T. H. Khan, submitted that since the Government have taken the capitalized value of the rent from his client which, according to him, includ­ed not only compensation payable to the owner but all future rents, Government was no more entitled to assess any rent upon the suit land and realize the same from the plaintiff-respondents.<br/> <br/>8. There is no definition provided to the expres­sion 'capitalized value' in the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act which might have thrown some light on its meaning so as to enable us to either accept or reject the contention of the learned Counsel. Apart from the absence of any definition of the aforesaid terms there arc no provisions in the aforesaid Act recognising the existence of 'Lakhiraj' land meaning land not liable to pay any rent. ‘Lakhiraj’ lands which existed in the Mughal period and continued through the British Rule extending upto the enact­ment of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act ceased to exist. In section 22 of the Act express pro­visions are made subjecting all lands to assessment and payment of rent. Its provisions are<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"22. (1) Notwithstanding anything con­tained in any other law for the time being in force or in any entry made in the record-of-rights last prepared and finally published under Chapter X of the Bengal Tenancy Act, 1885, all lands in any district or part of a district or local area in respect of which a record-of-rights is pre­pared or revised under this Chapter shall be sub­ject to the payment of fair and equitable rent de­termined in accordance with provisions of this Chapter and the rent so determined shall be en­tered in the record-of-rights so prepared or re­vised:<br/>Provided that it shall not be necessary to de­termine under this Chapter, the rent of any land, the rent of which has already been determined under section 5 and the rent so determined shall be deemed to be fair and equitable rent deter­mined in accordance with the-provision of this Chapter.<br/>(2) Where the fair and equitable rent determined or deemed to be determined for any land wider the provisions of this Chapter has not tak­en effect earlier under any other provision of this Act, it shall take effect from the first day of the Agricultural year next following the date of publication of the notification under sub-section (2) of section 43 declaring that a Compensation Assessment -roll in respect of the area in which the land is situated has been finally published]."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>9. In view of the clear provisions of this section s.22 which subjects all lands to payment of fair and equitable rent, the contention of the learned Counsel for the respondent Mills that the impugned assessment of rent under section 50 of the aforesaid Act suffered from illegality, only because there was no term in the Agreement for payment of rent, is unacceptable. Non inclusion of such term for payment of rent in the Agreement was, he submitted, due to the fact that the Government in taking compensation from the respondent Mills included future rents as capitalised value of the land. On reference to the Agreement itself we found nothing therein to substantiate his contention. While construing a document the in the parties is to be discovered from the words and expressions employed therein. There are no words or expressions in the Agreement which show that Government intended to exempt the re­spondent Mills from payment of rent assessable on their lands in future. Nor is there any words or ex­pression showing inclusion of all future rents in the compensation payable by the respondent Mills.<br/><br/>10. The obligation of the respondent Mills to pay rent for lands acquired by the Government and delivered to it arises under the provisions of law. Whatever understanding may now be alluded to in support of the contention that rent was not payable the respondent Mills or whatever entry may exist in the khatian showing the lands in question to be rent-free, there cannot be any escape from cither assess­ment or payment of rent as required by section 22 of the Slate Acquisition and Tenancy Act. In discover­ing this provision of law Government wrote the fol­lowing letter on 28th November 1960:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Office of the Board of Revenue, East Pakistan Memo.NoJ207-E-80/58-S &amp;S dated the 28th November, 1960.<br/><br/>To<br/>The Director of Land Records &amp; Survey,<br/>E.P. Tejgaon, Dhaka,<br/>Sub: - Assessment of Land Acquired under Act I of 1894.<br/>Ref: - His Memo. No. 52/60-1660-C dated 22.2.60.<br/>The undersigned is directed to say that lands ac­quired both under the Land Acquisition Act, 1899 and the E.B (Emergency) Requisition of property of property Act, 1948 for Companies firms and In­dustrial concerns had hitherto been made over to the requiring bodies under a deed of transfer al­lowing them to hold such land free of rent after realising capitalized value of Government reve­nue or rent. As there arc to be no fee simple or rent free lands now after state acquisition the question of extinguishing the free holds created in the lands acquired in the past and settled with the requiring, bodies as referred to above with capitalisation of the land revenue or rent and making such lands assessable to fair and equita­ble rent was considered by Government in con­sultation with their Law Officers. It has been de­cided that in view of the provisions of section 22 of the E.B. S.A. and T. Act, 1950, all land acquired under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and the E.B. (Emergency) Requisition of Proper­ty Act, 1948 for Companies, Firm and Industri­al concerns and made over to the requiring bod­ies to hold free of rent after realising capitalised value of Government Revenue or rent should be assessed to fair and just rent as provided in Sec­tions 23 and 26 of the E.B.S.A. and T. Act, 1950. Necessary action may please be taken ac­cordingly needless to say such persons Compa­nies or Firms will receive in lieu compensa­tion as payable for rent free lands.<br/>Sd/- N. Ahmed,<br/>Addl. Secretary,<br/>Board of Revenue, East Pakistan.<br/>Seen.<br/>Please issue notice<br/>upon the owners of the<br/>Mills and industrial firms<br/>whose rent has not been a<br/>assessed fixing 5.4.61 at 9 A.M.<br/>Sd/- Illegible<br/>R.O.<br/>28.3.61<br/>Memo. No. 1207/1(16)-E, dated 28.11.60."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>11. Even if previously there were contrary pro­visions in any law, or in any entry in record of rights prepared under such law, they would be of no avail. This is made clear by the opening words of section 22(1) of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act which are "notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any entry made in the record-of rights last prepared and finally published under Chapter X of the Bengal Te­nancy Act, 1885...........” So, the submissions of respondents" Counsel that there are provisions for including future rents in compensation by way of capitalized value of the lands acquired under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 or that there are provisions for rent-free lands in the Bengal Tenancy Act, 1885 have no more any basis.<br/> <br/>12. Above all, in view of the express provisions of section 22 even Government cannot, by an order or agreement, exempt any land from assessment or payment of rent, for the words used in the section are mandatory, namely, "all lands.............shall be sub­ject to the payment of fair and equitable rents........".<br/> <br/>13. Thus, it appears that the Government direc­tion as contained in the aforesaid letter dated 28th November 1960 to pay rent in respect of the lands acquired for and delivered to the respondent Mills is in accordance with law and Government is entitled to payment of rents already made in pursuance of the letter and also all future payments of rent to be made according to direction therein. No declaration that the suit land is not liable to be assessed under any provi­sion of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 as being illegal, without jurisdiction, null and void nor any declaration that the plaintiff is not liable for the period, 1363-1368 B.S. can, therefore, be giv­en. In this connection it may, however, be men­tioned that no prayer was made in the plaint for de­claring the letter dated 28th November 1960 as ille­gal, without jurisdiction, null and void, but even if such prayer was made by the plaintiff-respondent Mills, this could not, for reasons stated above, be granted, because directions for payment of rent as made therein are intra vires the provisions of law. Government has no power to grant exemption from payment of rent in respect of lands mentioned in sec­tion 22 of the Act, and if such exemption is granted it will be beyond its jurisdiction and power.<br/> <br/>14. The appeal is allowed and the judgments of the Courts below are set aside. There will, however, be no order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
