M. Ruhul Amin J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This appeal by leave is directed against the judgment and order dated 31-8-1997 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 1804 of 1994 making the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>2. Short facts are that the writ petitioner-respondent Nos. 1 and 2 filed the writ petition challenging the order passed by the petitioners refusing to release the excess and unutilised land measuring 54 decimals acquired in LA Case No. 83 of 1960-1961 in compliance with the decision of the authority contained in Memo dated 28-6-1990 (Annexure A) to the writ petition stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the writ petitioner-respondents are the legal owners of the acquired land situated in Mouza South Kattali, PS Pahartali, District-Chittagong and the same was acquired for housing estate and for construction of link road. After the said acquisition only about 46 decimals of the land of the respondents out of 1.26 acres in total were utilised for the construction of the 60 feet wide pucca link road between Kattali road and Halishahar Housing Society. As a result 54 decimals of land on both sides of the road were left unutilised from the very beginning and the same was, at all material times, under the continuous possession of the writ petitioner-respondents. The Government neither utilised the said land nor took over possession of the same. The further case is that the Government decided to return the unutilised acquired land to the lawful owners and accordingly, a circular dated 22-5-1986 (Annexure-E to the writ petition) was issued. Thereafter, the writ petitioners submitted representation in April 1987 to the respondent leave petitioner No.3, the Deputy Commissioner, Chittagong for retur­ning the unutilised acquired land measuring 54 decimals to the writ petitioner-respondents. Accordingly, the Deputy Commissioner directed Executive Engineer, Housing and Settlement Division, Chittagong to de­requisition the same but it was not done. Thereafter, the writ petitioner sent another representation on 2-6-1987 to the respondent-leave petitioner No.1 praying for release of the said unutilised land in their favour. On the basis of this representation, the Ministry of Works obtained opinion of Chief Engineer, Housing and Settlement regarding de-requisition of the unutilised land but ultimately, no action was taken. Thereafter, another application was filed on 7-3-1989 but no action was taken for release of the land in their favour.<br/> <br/>3. The appellants contested the Rule by filing affidavit-in-opposition contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that in LA Case No. 83 of 1960-1961 the aforesaid land was acquired and, there was a proposal for construction of 90 feet wide road but 60 feet wide road was constructed and in future the land may be required for extension of the road and, as such, the land should not be released in favour of the writ petitioner-respondents.<br/> <br/>4. The High Court Division upon hearing made the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>5. Leave was granted to consider the submission that the land in question were acquired on payment of compensation money to the owner and, as such, the ownership of the previous owner having been vested in the Government, the writ petitioner respondents' right, title, interest and possession, if any, in the acquired land had extinguished and, as such, the High Court Division committed error of law in making the Rule absolute and the submission that  the Government  circular dated 22-5-1986 has no force of law and, as such, not applicable in the present case as the said circular is an inter-Ministerial Communi­cation and, as such, the High Court Division erred in law in making the Rule absolute and the last submission that under section 8B of the (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act,1948 the writ petitioners having withdrawn com­pensation money for the acquired property cannot get release of the same even if some portion remains unutilised.<br/> <br/>6. We have heard Mr. AJ Mohammad Ali, the learned Attorney-General for the appella­nts and Mr. Khandker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, the learned Counsel for respondent No. 2 and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/> <br/>7. It is not disputed that an area of 1.26 acres of land situated in Mouza South Kattali, PS Pahartali, District-Chittagong was acquired in LA Case No. 83 of 1960-1961 for Halishahar Housing Estate and also for construction of link road between Kattali Road and Halishahar Housing Society.<br/> <br/>8. The writ petitioners' contention is that after construction of link road between Kattali Road and Halishahar Housing Society, an area of 54 decimals of land out of the total acquired land remained unutilised and in terms of circular dated 22-5-1986 (Annexure E to the writ petition) issued by the Government, they are entitled to get release of the same.<br/> <br/>9. The contention of the appellant, on the other hand, is that the unutilised land may be required in future for the extension and development of the road already constructed and, as such, the same should not be released.<br/> <br/>10. The learned Attorney-General submits that under section 8B of the (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act, 1948 the writ petitioners having received compensation money for the land, the same absolutely vested in the Government finally, and hence the same cannot be released in their favour even if some portion remains unutilised for years and the Government circular dated 22-5-1986 cannot override the law.  The learned Attorney-General further submits that the above circular is inter-ministerial correspondence between two government departments having no statutory and binding force. He further submits that after compensation is paid for acquisition of the land, no order can be made for release of such acquired land. In support of his contention the learned Attorney-General relied upon the case of <strong><em>Bangladesh vs. Commercial Trust of Bangladesh Ltd. </em></strong>reported in<strong><em> 46 DLR (AD) 89</em></strong> and the case of <strong><em>Ali Ahmed and others vs Government of Bangladesh and others vs. Bangladesh </em></strong>reported in<strong><em> 55 DLR (AD) 92.</em></strong> He then cited the case of <strong><em>Al-haj Abul Basher being dead his heirs (a) Hosne Ara Begum and others vs. Bangladesh </em></strong>reported in <strong><em>2997 BLD (AD) 321</em></strong>. In that case the land remained unutilised for 28 years and it was argued that it was the declared policy of the Government to return the unutilised land to the original owners but it was held that the inter-Ministerial Communi­cations are merely policy decisions and guidelines for various departments of the Government and the same is not a declared policy decision of the Government and there is also no lawful obligation on the part of the Government to act on such circulars and decisions. In that case it was further held that mere non-use of the land for years will not give any right to the petitioners, It was further observed that after completing all necessary formalities the land had already been handed over to the requiring body and no legal or vested right has accrued in favour of the original owners by mere inter-Ministerial Communications and the original owners cannot have any legal right to ask for return of the land. In <strong><em>55 DLR (AD) 92</em></strong> case the remaining acquired land if remained unutilised for 36 years and this Court held that since the land had already been handed over to the requiring body on payment of compensation, the requisi­tioned land is not liable to be released even if it remains unutilised by the requiring body for 36 years.<br/> <br/>11. Mr. Ahmed mainly argued that since the Government by the above-mentioned circular decided to return the acquired land to the original owners, the Government is bound by the decision and, as such, required to return the land to the writ petitioners. In support of his contention, he cited the case of <strong><em>Ameer Hossain (Md) and others vs. Secretary, Ministry of Land, Bangladesh Secretariat and others </em></strong>reported in<strong><em> 7 BLC 689</em></strong> and argued that in that case, the High Court Division held that the acquisition of the access land was invalid and the same was liable to be withdrawn from the order of acquisition and the possession thereof is liable to be restored to the original owners. It is clear that the argument as has been advanced by Mr. Ahmed was put forward in the case reported in <strong><em>1997 BLD (AD) 322 = 50 DLR (AD) 22.</em></strong> We have already pointed out in that case it was held that inter-Ministerial Communications are merely policy decisions and guidelines for various departments of the Government and the same is not a declared policy decision of the Government and there is also no lawful obligation on the part of the Government to act on those circulars and decisions and mere non-use of the land for years will not give any right to the original owners to get back the same released from acquisition.<br/> <br/>12. Therefore, the <strong><em>7 BLC 689</em></strong> case does not help Mr. Ahmed in view of the series of decisions of the Appellate Division on the point as mentioned earlier.<br/> <br/>13. We are of the view that under provi­sions of section 8B of the (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act, 1948 once com­pensation money is paid to the original owners the acquired land cannot be released from acquisition.<br/> <br/>14. For ready reference let us reproduce below section 8B of the (Emergency) Requisi­tion of Property Act, 1948:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"<strong>8B. Withdrawal from Acquisition.—</strong> When the owner of any property which has been acquired under section 5 is willing to receive back the property, the Government may, at any time before the payment of compensation, withdraw from the acquisition of any such property by notification published in the Official Gazette, and on such withdrawal, the property shall be restored to the possession of the owner, and with effect from the date of such restoration, the property shall vest back in the owner with the rights which he had before such property was acquired.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>15. Thus it is clear that after payment of compensation money to the original owners, under provisions of section 8B (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act, 1948 the acquired land cannot be released in favour of the original owners. The government circular dated 22-5-1986, as relied upon by the learned Counsel for the respondents, is mere inter-Ministerial Communication and guideline for various departments of the Government and the same is not a declared policy decision of the Government and same has no statutory and binding force and, as such, on the basis of the circular the Government is not required to release the unutilised acquired land to the original owners rather may use the same for any other public purpose.<br/> <br/>16. In view of the discussion above, we are of the view that the High Court Division committed an error of law in making the Rule absolute directing release of the excess unutilised acquired land measuring 54 decimals and handing over the same to the writ petitioners within 60 days.<br/> <br/>For the reasons and discussions above, the appeal is allowed without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>
