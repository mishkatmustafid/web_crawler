The appeal, at the instance of the Government, is directed against the High Court Division's judgment and order dated November 28, 1991 passed in Writ Petition No. 343 of 1987, striking down an acquisition notification.<br/> <br/>2. In their Writ Petition before the High Court Division respondent Nos. 1‑3, washermen by profession, challenged the acquisition asserting, inter alia, that as owners in possession they have been using the case land from time immemorial, as the vacant northern portion of their ancestral homestead, for washing and drying clothes. In the first week of January, 19815 they came to know that the Authorised Officer and Lend Acquisition Officer, Dhaka in June, 1984 issued a notice under section 3 of the Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance, 1982 (Ordinance No. II of 1982) for acquisition of their said land in LA Case No. 49/1983‑84 for extension of Darul Ulum Ahsania Madrassa. The notice was suppressed and not served on them. On January 21, 1985 the respondents filed an objection before the Additional Deputy Commissioner (LA), Dhaka, but having had no (response thereto they filed another objection petition on February 6, 1985 before the Joint Secretary, Ministry of Land Administration and Land Reforms, but that objection petition was rejected without giving any hearing to them. On April 6, 1985 the respondents filed another objection petition before the Minister of Land Administration and Land Reforms who was pleased to direct the Land Reforms Commissioner to enquire into the matter. After an open and on the spot enquiry into the matter the Commissioner submitted his report clearly holding that the case land was not essential for the alleged purpose of acquisition and that there was sufficient vacant space in the Madrassa premises as well as in the adjoining area which could be acquired for extension of the Madrassa in question. By an order dated June 6, 1985 the respondents were informed that the Government decided not to acquire the case land of the petitioners and requested the Additional Deputy Commissioner to annul all actions taken in this regard and that if the requiring body still insisted on acquisition of land, alternative sites should be selected. In spite of the aforesaid decision of the Government the Deputy Commis­sioner, Dhaka, proceeded with acquisition of the case land and published the impugned notification on November 6, 1986 finally acquiring the case land,<br/> <br/>3. The appellant's case is, that the respondents' land was validly acquired for a public purpose and that on reconsideration the order dated June 4, 1985 was cancelled by the Government by another order dated September 9, 1985, and, thereafter, the acquisition proceedings were completed by issuing the impugned Notification dated November 6, 1986.<br/> <br/>4. The High Court Division did not accept the respondents' two main contentions that the purpose for which the property was acquired was not a public purpose and that the subsequent Government decision not to proceed with acquisition was malafide. It, however, accepted the respondents' new submission, made at the time of the hearing, that the requiring body having not deposited the compensation money within 6 months from the date of decision of the Government to acquire the property all proceedings in respect of acquisition stood abated under section 12.<br/> <br/>5. The High Court Division held that the time for payment for compensation began to run from January 5, 1985 when the decision to acquire the property was made and notice under section 6 was signed. On May 28, 1985 the requiring body was asked to deposit the money, but the requiring body made the deposit on February 17, 1986. The High Court Division observed that "it can at best be said that the acquisition proceeding remained stayed" from the period from June 4, 1985, the date of annulment of acquisition, to September 22, 1985, the date of communication to the Deputy Commissioner cancelling the annulment. It was held that even excluding that period from June, 1985 to September 22, 1985 the deposit made by the requiring body on February 17, 1986 was not made within six months from the final decision to acquire the property on January 5, 1985.<br/> <br/>6. Mr. Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan, the learned Additional Attorney‑General, at first urged that the Government's decision dated June 4, 1985 to annul the acquisition proceedings had the effect of wiping out the previous proceedings, and by the subsequent order dated September 4, 1985 a fresh acquisition proceeding was started after annulment, and hence either September 4, 1985 or September 22, 1985 when the order was communicated to the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka ought to have been taken as the starting point of limitation of six months for deposit of compensation and as the deposit was made on February 17, 1986 by the requiring body within the period of six months specified in section 12 there was no contravention of that section.<br/> <br/>7. Knowing well that the acquisition proceeding was not, in fact, started by issuing fresh notices of acquisition, etc. the learned Additional Attorney-General did not press the above contention. Instead, he submitted that the High Court Division erroneously upheld the petitioner's contention, made impromptu during the hearing, about violation of section 12 of the Ordinance, when there was no such averment either in the petition or in the affidavit‑in ­reply of the writ petitioners. It was submitted that the respondents had all along been challenging the order of acquisition and for their own fault no compensation could be paid in time.<br/> <br/>8. Mr. Fazlul Karim, the learned Counsel for respondents Nos. 1 to 3, however, urged that under section 15 of the Ordinance there must be an agreement and deposit of compensation money with the acquiring authority before any notice for acquisition of property for a non‑Government requiring body like a private Madrassa can be made and that the belated deposit of fund for compensation by the requiring‑body indicates that there had been no agreement between the Government and the requiring‑body before the notices for acquisition were issued. This plea, not urged before, does not call for any scrutiny. The requiring‑body may be asked to deposit the compensation money only after the decision to acquire is finally made by the Government. Sub‑section (1) of section 12 reads as follows :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"12. Abatement or Revocation of Acquisition Proceedings.- (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Ordinance, where in any case compensation has not been paid or deposited within a period of six months from the date of decision of the Government, the Divisional Commissioner, or the Deputy Commissioner, as the case, may be, for acquisition of the property under section 5 or the proviso to section 4(3) (b), as the case may be, for no fault of the person interested, all proceedings in respect of such acquisition shall, on the expiry of that period, stand abated and a declaration by the Deputy Commissioner to that effect shall be published in the official Gazette. (The period of six months was substituted by one year by section 2 of Act XVI of 1987)."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>9. The expression "compensation has not been paid or deposited within six months from the date of decision" for acquisition in sub‑section (1) of Section 12 is to be understood with reference to section 10.<br/> <br/>10. Section 10 provides for payment of compensation:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"(1) On making an award under section 7, the Deputy Commissioner shall, before taking possession of the property, tender payment of the compensation awarded by him to the persons entitled thereto according to the award, and shall pay it to them unless prevented by some one or more of the contingencies mentioned in sub­section (2).<br/><br/>(2) If the persons entitled to compensation do not consent to receive it, or if there be no person competent to receive the compensation or, if there be any dispute as to title to receive the compensation or as to the appointment of it, the Deputy Commissioner shall keep the amount of the compensation in a deposit account in the Public Account of the Republic which shall be deemed payment for the purpose of taking over possession of the property without any prejudice to the claim of the parties to be determined by the Arbitrator ..................</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>11. The provision of section 12 will come into play only when the compensation is not paid to the persons interested or not kept in a deposit account in the Public Account of the Republic under sub‑section (1) of section 10. Under section 12 no obligation as such is placed on the requiring body to deposit compensation within six months from the date of decision for acquisition.<br/> <br/>12. From annexure 'E' to the writ petition it appears a notice under section 6 was served upon the persons interested in the property to appear before the authorised officer by January 22, 1985 for stating the nature of their interest in the property and the amount and particulars of their claims to compensation for such interest. Instead of appearing before the authorised officer on January 22, 1985, the petitioners filed a day before, on January 21, 1985 an objection petition before the Joint Secretary. The writ petitioners, always busy with their successive petitions objecting to the acquisi­tion, had no occasion to complain about non­payment of compensation. It was because of the writ petitioners the process of making award and payment of compensation stalled.<br/> <br/>13. There could be no averment and there is none, in the writ petition that no compensation was paid under sub‑section (1) of section 10 or there was any occasion for deposit of the compensation in a deposit account in the Public Account of the Republic as per provision of sub‑section (2) of that section the question of invoking section 12 does not arise. It is only in case of non‑compliance of the provisions of section 10 the question of abatement or revocation of the acquisition proceeding will arise. The learned Judges of the High Court Division totally failed to examine this aspect of the matter and erroneously invoked section 12 and wrongly directed the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka to record an order to the effect that the acquisition proceeding stood abated.<br/> <br/>14. In the result, Civil Appeal No. 20 of 1993 is allowed, but without any order as to cost.<br/> <br/>15. No further order is necessary in Civil Petition No. 58 of 1992, filed by the requiring body, and, is accordingly disposed of.<br/> <br/>16. The petitioners in writ petition before the High Court Division filed civil petition for leave to appeal No. 58 of 1993 on February 22, 1993. The petition is time‑barred by 354 days. On the top of the paper book it is described as civil petition, but on the cause list it is mentioned as cross petition for leave to appeal. The petitioner's explanation for the delay is that on February 6, 1993 they received the notice of granting leave in the appellant's leave petition No. 85 of 1992 and thereafter they filed the cross petition on February 22, 1993. There is no provision for filing cross petition for leave to appeal before this Court. Their explanation for condonation of the delay is not satisfactory. Civil Petition No. 58 of 1993 is dismissed as time‑barred.<br/> <br/><strong><u>Mustafa Kamal, J:</u></strong><br/> <br/>I agree with the judgment given by my learned brother MH Rahman, J. I would like to add the following:<br/> <br/>18. There is an all‑round confusion as to the meaning of section 12. The owner of the land, the acquiring authority and the requiring body (it is a body other than the Government) are all harbouring the impression that an acquisition proceeding will abate under section 12 if the requiring body has not "paid" or "deposited" the compensation for money within a period of one year from the date of decision of the Government. That is not so.<br/> <br/>19. Under section 15, when any property is proposed to be acquired for any person other than the Government, such person shall enter into an agreement with the Government in a prescribed form before a notice under section 3 is published. The Deputy Commissioner has to tender and pay compensation to "the persons interested", before taking possession, to be assessed in terms of sections 8 and 9. The payment of compensation regulated by section 10. It is either "paid" in terms of section 10(1) or "deposited" in terms of section 10(2). It is this "payment" and "deposit" in section 10 which is attracted in section 12, not the deposit of compensation by the requiring body. Reading all the sections together, sections 8, 9, 10, 12 and 15, it is clear that abatement will take place if the acquiring authority fails to "pay" or "deposit" compensation in terms of section 10 within one year from the date of decision of the Government (which is section 5 in the case of acquisition). The requiring body, therefore, will deposit the consideration money with the Government well ahead of expiry of one year from the date of decision of the Government, but within what date, is a subject matter of agreement between the Government and the requiring body under section 15. This is their internal arrangement, but legal consequence of abatement will follow only when the Government fails to "pay" or "deposit" compensation in terms of section 10.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
