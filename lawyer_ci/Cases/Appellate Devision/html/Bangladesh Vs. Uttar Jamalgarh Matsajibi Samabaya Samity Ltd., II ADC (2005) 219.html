The appellant's simple contention is that it was not party to the com­promise and that no rule having been issued against it, the order accepting the compromise is not binding upon it. The appellant-Government has been represented in these appeals by Mr. A.W. Bhuiyan, learned Additional Attorney General, but none has appeared for the respondents.<br/> <br/>2. The matter had originated from Title Suit No. 51 of 1982 of the First Court of Subordinate Judge, Sunamganj, which was filed by respon­dents Nos. 2 and 3 (plaintiffs) against respondent No. 1 (defendant No. 1)—Uttar Jamalgarh Matsyajibi Samabaya Samity. The appellant-Government of Bangladesh, was defendant No. 4, Director of Fisheries and District Fishery Corporation were respectively defendants Nos. 2 and 3 in that suit. The Government -defen­dant, by a deed of lease dated 15 September 1981, leased out a fishery known as 'Bogiyani Group Fishery' to the plaintiffs-respondents for three years from 1389 B.S. to 1391 B.S. with a provision for renewal for the next three years, that is, up to 1394 B.S. with a provision fro renewal for the next three years, that is, upto 1394 B.S. While the plaintiffs were in posses­sion of the fishery under the said lease, the Director of Fisheries (defendant No. 2), by an order dated 5 October 1981, leased out the said fishery to respondent defendant No. 1 for the same period, more or less; that is why the plain­tiffs filed the suit praying, among other things, for a declaration of nullity of the defendants' subsequent lease order dated 5 October 1981 in favour of defendant No. 1. The Government (defendant No. 4) and the subsequent lessee, defendant No. 1, contested the suit; but it was decreed by the Subordinate Judge by a judgment dated 31 August 1983. By this decree the plaintiffs' lease upto 1391 B.S. was held valid and that he would also get renewal of the lease for the next three years, from 1392 to 1394 B.S. Plaintiffs' further prayer for permanent injunc­tion was, however, refused.<br/> <br/>3. This decree was challenged by both par­ties in Title Appeals Nos. 259 and 269 of 1983. These appeals were disposed of by the Additional District Judge, First Court, Sylhet, by a judgment and decree dated 13 December 1983. By this appellate decree, the trial Court's decree was modified to the extent that plain­tiffs' lease period was restricted to the original period of three years, that is, upto 1391 B.S. and their prayer for renewal was rejected as being 'premature'.<br/> <br/>4.  Thereafter the two sets of lessees, as mentioned above, came to the High Court Division with four Revision Cases and jointly submitted the petition of compromise, dated 24-10-87. The Government was not a party to the compromise nor was any rule issued against it. The compromise was accepted by the Court and in terms of the compromise the appellate Court's judgment was reversed and that of the trial Court was restored. One of the main provisions of the compromise was that the plaintiffs would get renewal of their lease for three years form 1392 to 1394 B.S. This became now a part of the Court's decree. The appellant had in the meantime leased out the fishery to a fisheries Development Corporation for 10 years begin­ning from 1392 B. S. By the Compromise decree the Government's right to lease out the fishery from 1392 B.S. was affected. That is why the appellant obtained leave from this Court challenging the compromise decree so far as it affects its right.<br/> <br/>5. The learned Additional Attorney General has contended that the Government-Defendant No.4 (now appellant here) is not bound by the compromise decree. This contention must be accepted; as the Government was not party to the compromise between the two sets of lessees, it is not binding upon it. The learned Additional Attorney General has also contended that the compromise is collusive and that by a compromise between the parties the Court's decree cannot be set aside. In view of the broad fact that the compromise in question in this case is not binding upon the Government the con­tentions as to Court's jurisdiction to set aside the appellate decision and as to the nature of the compromise, whether it is collusive, need not be gone into.<br/> <br/>6. In the result, all the four appeals are allowed and the order of the High Court Division is modified to the extent that the com­promise between the two lessees is not binding upon the appellant.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></span></div></div></div>
