The case is therefore sent back on remand to the trial court allowing the defendants to adduce additional evidence and the plaintiff to confront the same. </strong><br/> <br/><strong>Lawyers Involved:</strong><br/>M.Nurullanh, Attorney-General (A.F.Hassan Arif, Deputy Attorney General and B.

A. Nos. 73 and 143 of 1982.)<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Badrul Haider Chowdhury J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>Those two appeals arise out of Title Suit No.33 of 1979 and Title Suit No. 320 of 1980 in the 3rd Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka. These will be disposed of by this judgment since these two suits were tried analogously arising out of the same facts and circumstances with different prayers in respect thereof.<br/> <br/>2. The Dhaka Lodge Welfare Society is the plaintiff-respondent. The suits were dismissed by the trial Court, but on appeal the High Court Division reversed the findings of the trial Court and allowed the appeal.<br/> <br/>3. Facts are as follows: In 1928 Dhaka Lodge was given a lease of the suit plots being Plots No.74, 160 and 163 of mouza Purana Paltan at holding No.71 measuring more or less 1 bigha 5 katha for 99 years. The Lodge Dhaka, a Philanthropic Organization executed the Kabuliyat at an annual rental of Tk.135/-. Since then the plaintiff was in peaceful possession of the property. In December 1972 the Lodge Dhaka was renamed as the Dhaka Lodge. It seems a new society was formed with the members of the Dhaka Lodge Welfare Society and registered with the Registrar of Joint Stock Company by a resolution dated 12.9.1976. This change, was effected and it was resolved that the assets and liabilities are to be managed by the new society namely, the Dhaka Lodge Welfare Society.<br/> <br/>4. There is a two storied building having 3 rooms in each floor and the entire property including the building was under the possession of the plaintiff's society. Trouble started when the Government was given the permissive uses of the premises and since the title of the plaintiff was in question the plaintiff brought the suit for declaration in April, 1978 being Title Suit No.193 of 1978 in the Court of 3rd Munsif and further another suit was brought in the 3rd Court of Subordinate Judge in 1979 being Title Suit No. 33 of 1979. The cumulative effect of the suits was for declaration of title of the plaintiff's society and further a declaration that the entrance of the Government in both the floors of the building was illegal and unauthorised and for eviction of the defendants.<br/> <br/>5. Title Suit No.193 of 1978 was transferred and renumbered as Title Suit No.320 of 1980 for analogous trial with Title Suit No.33 of 1979<br/> <br/>6. In view of our proposed order we advisedly refrain from dealing with the factual aspect of the case, but in passing it will be noticed that a serious challenge had been given to the status and locus standi of the plaintiff’s society by the Government of Bangladesh.<br/> <br/>7. As has been noticed the Lodge Dhaka was renamed as Dhaka Lodge in December 1972 and one Dr. B.K. Sen Gupta look charge of Dhaka Lodge in August, 976.<br/> <br/>8. The Government took the stand that the suit property was taken over by the Collector on being surrendered by the lessee through its treasurer; it has been surrendered by D.W.5, who was Treasurer of Dhaka Lodge. The authority of this person for making surrender had been challenged by the plaintiffs Society. On evidence the trial Court further took the view that the plaintiff society was not a successor of the Lodge Dhaka. In other words, the plaintiff society has no locus standi since it is not the original lessee.<br/> <br/>9. On appeal the High Court Division took the view that the trial Court misconceived the nature and the scope of claim in the suits and concluded by saying:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"In the absence of any evidence that Dhaka Lodge Welfare Society was established for different purposes and there was a complete departure from the purposes for which Lodge Dhaka or Dhaka Lodge was functioning we have no doubt that the Dhaka Lodge Welfare Society has been functioning with the same objective of Dhaka Lodge."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>With this observation the High Court Division allowed the appeal and decreed the suit.<br/> <br/>10. Mr. M. Nurullah, learned Attorney-General appearing for the appellant, submitted that the conclusion of the High Court Division is founded on certain surmises and pointed out that the leave was granted to consider the question whether the plaintiff could make any claim in view of the express surrender of the property to (he Government in pursuance of the instruction of the authority of the United Grand Lodge of England. The learned Attorney General filed a prayer for additional evidence with certain annexures while adjudicating the appeal "to consider the above-mentioned documents at the time of hearing of the appeals in the interest of justice, otherwise the appellants will be greatly prejudiced". Exhibits A and A1 are the correspondence between the Government and the Treasurer of Dhaka Lodge and Ext. A1 is a correspondence between the Grand Secretary, United Grand Lodge of England and (he Treasurer of Dhaka Lodge. Exhibit-B is the letter from the Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Land Administration and Land Reforms addressed to the Secretary, United Grand Lodge of England and its reply is Annexure-C with quarterly communication showing the Dhaka Lodge No.3323 was erased from the roll of Grand Lodge in December 1977. The annexure is marked Ext.-D. The learned Attorney-General submitted that these annexures could not be produced before the trial Court since by the time they were discovered the trial Court rejected the prayer to make them exhibits, inasmuch as, the evidence was closed by that time(15.3.82). The trial Court by order dated 8.4.82 Order No. 59 rejected the prayer for making the said letters as Exhibits.<br/> <br/>11. Mr. S. R. Pal, learned Counsel appearing for the respondent canvassed that the Exts. B, C and D are not genuine papers and these should not be considered or taken as additional evidence.<br/> <br/>12. Having heard the learned Counsels at length we have come to the view that the constitutional obligation of this Court is to do complete justice in the cause or matter and while doing so it has become imperative for giving due consideration to these annexures to clarify the factual position which in the final analysis can be given by the trial Court. That will enable the plaintiff to give their challenge to such documents and the resolution of the dispute can be made by the trial Court by giving full consideration to the evidence.<br/> <br/>13. In view of the above, these appeals are allowed and the suits are remanded to the trial Court to allow the defendants id produce these evidence as additional evidence which will enable the plaintiff to give challenge 10 the claim. There will be no order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
