Suit No. 3 of 1997, allowing the plaintiff's prayer for temporary injunction, under order 39 Rule 1 and 2 of the Code of the Civil Procedure, restraining the defendants from accepting ten­der for leasing out the suit fisheries and or set­tling the same with any bidder pending dispos­al of the suit.<br/> <br/>2. Plaintiff respondent No. 1 instituted the suit for declaration simpliciter that the tender notice dated 22.2.97 issued under the signature of the Deputy Commissioner, Netrakona in respect of Khaliajuri Group of Fisheries, men­tioned in item Nos. 42 to 55 of the said notice is illegal, void etc.<br/> <br/>3. His case in short is that, there are 16 beels in the said group fisheries of which 14 beels comprising of the suit fisheries are situat­ed within Netraka District and the rest two namely, Beki beel and Feni beel are situated within Kionshorgonj District. He got lease of all those beels for 3 years from 1401 to 1403 B.S. Due to certain litigations the Government could not hand over possession of all the beels to him for the said lease period and thereby he faced great loss. In the circumstances, he prayed for lease of the said fisheries for another 3 years from 1404-1406 B.S. But the relevant authori­ty allowed his prayer only with respect to Beki beel and Feni beel situated within Kishorgonj District. He filed a review application in the concerned Ministry. But while his review peti­tion had been under the process of being con­sidered by the concerned authorities, the Deputy Commissioner, Netrakona most illegal­ly invited the impugned tender.<br/> <br/>4. After the filing of the suit the plaintiff filed an application for temporary injunction against the defendants. The trial Court initially passed an ex parte order of <em>ad interim</em> injunction and ultimately by its judgment order dated 27.3.97 granted temporary injunction as men­tioned earlier. On an appeal preferred against the said order of the trial Court by the appel­lants, a Division Bench of the High Court Division by the impugned judgment and order disposed of the appeal, directing the trial Court to dispose of the suit by 4th August 1997. The learned Judges, however, did not express any opinion as to the order appealed against, regard­ing granting of temporary injunction by the trial Court. They made a wrong observation that the trial court had directed the parties to maintain <em>status quo</em> in respect of the suit fisheries.<br/> <br/>5. Leave was granted to consider whether the learned Judges of the High Court Division failed to notice that the plaintiff's lease of the suit fisheries had already  expired on the 30 Chaitra 1403 B. S. and thereby there could be no question of continuation of his lease or restraining the defendants from accepting ten­der for leasing out the suit beels for the years 1404-1406 B.S. in as much as the plaintiff hav­ing no subsisting right to the suit fisheries has no <em>prima facie</em> case for injunction. Secondly, whether the question of convenience and incon­venience for granting temporary injunction was also against the plaintiff in as much as no irreparable loss or injury would be suffered by him, which cannot be compensated in terms of money.<br/> <br/>6. Mr. Mahbubey Alam, the learned Additional Attorney General, submits that the learned Judges of the High Court Division hopelessly failed to apply their judicial mind in passing the impugned judgment which is appar­ent on the face of the record in view of the fact that the trial court passed the order of temporary injunction restraining the defendants from inter­fering with the plaintiffs possession in the suit fisheries pending disposal of the suit but the learned Judges have made an incorrect observa­tion that the trial court had directed the parties to maintain <em>status quo</em> in respect of the suit fish­eries. He further submits that the learned Judges in disposing of the appeal neither affirmed nor set aside nor even modified the order appealed against and as such in the interest of justice the impugned judgment is liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/>7. Mr. M. Nawab Ali, learned Advocate-on-Record appearing for plaintiff respondent No. 1 frankly submits that after the expiry of the lease for the term  1401-1403 B.S.  the concerned authority has already taken over possession of the fisheries in question from the plaintiff.<br/> <br/>8. Thus it appear that there is no force of the impugned order of temporary injunction as passed by the trial court.<br/> <br/>In that view of the matter we allow this appeal without any order as to cost. In conse­quence thereof both the impugned judgment of the High Court Division as well as the order of temporary injunction passed by the trial court are set aside.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
