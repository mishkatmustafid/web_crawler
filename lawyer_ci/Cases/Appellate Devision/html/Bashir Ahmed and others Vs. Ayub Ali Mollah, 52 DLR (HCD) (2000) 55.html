Petitioner as plaintiff instituted the suit in question for ejectment of the defendant-opposite party, a monthly tenant, stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit property originally belonged to Fulesa Khatun who transferred the suit premises by a deed of gift in favour of the plaintiff, her son and that defendant had been a monthly tenant in the suit premises on the basis of an agreement dated 6-6-1970 and that the defendant was aware of the transfer of the suit property in favour of the plaintiff who was at first informally notified and later by a registered letter dated 7-3-93 he was so informed and thus was attorned and that the defendant is defaulter in respect of payment of rent who stopped payment of rent from December, 1992 and the plaintiff was also in <em>bona fide</em> requirement of the suit premises and, as such, a notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act has been served upon the defendant terminating his tenancy and still defendant did not vacate the suit premises and so the plaintiff filed the suit.<br/> <br/>3. Opposite party as defendant contested the suit filing written statement denying the material allegations made in the plaint and stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the defendant was not liable to be evicted from the suit property in view of Clause-H in the agreement and that the defendant offered rent of December, 1992 in favour of the plaintiff but the rent was not accepted nor the rent of January, 1993 was accepted by the landlord and the rent being sent to the landlord by money order the defendant filed House Rent Case No. 5 of 1993 and that the defendant was not aware of the transfer of the suit property in favour of the plaintiff and that since the defendant deposited rent in the HR Case No. 5 of 1993 he was not a defaulter.<br/> <br/>4. On consideration of the evidence on record the trial Court found that there was no <em>bona fide </em>requirement of the suit property and hence dismissed the suit by the judgment and decree dated 26-11-1996.<br/> <br/>5. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and decree the plaintiff as petitioner moved this Court and obtained the present Rule.<br/> <br/>6. Mr. Md. Fazlul Karim, learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff-petitioner submits that the plaintiff filed the suit for ejectment alleging that the defendant was a defaulter. The trial Court committed illegality in dismissing the suit without any finding as to whether the defendant was a defaulter. He further submits that there being arbitration clause in the agreement and the plaintiff making number of requests for vacating the suit premises but the defendant not vacating the same and also some attempts in fact being taken for amicable settlement of the matter through intervention of the well-wishers of the parties but still the defendant not complying with the requests nor vacating the suit premises the plaintiff felt constrained to file the suit. He further submits that though there is clause-H standing in the way of taking possession of the suit premises by the landlord in the absence of unwillingness of the tenant, but the House Rent Control Ordinance being special law providing provisions for eviction of the tenant specially in view of section 18(5) of the said Ordinance, this clause-H cannot stand in the way of taking legal action against the defendant in accordance with law.<br/> <br/>7. Mr. M Rezaul Karim, learned Advocate appearing for the defendant-opposite party, on the other hand, submits that from Exhibit <em>Uma</em>-Rent receipts it shows that the rent of April, 1991 was paid in time and therefore defendant-petitioner was not a defaulter as alleged by the plaintiff-petitioner. He further submits that the plaintiff himself admitted that none of the parties resorted to the condition appearing in the agreement and, as such, there being a specific provision for arbitration the said clause being not put into execution, the suit was not maintainable. Further submits that in view of clause ‘H’ in the agreement that the landlord would not take possession of the suit premises unless the tenant willingly hands over the possession, the decree sought for by the plaintiff for ejectment of the defendant, cannot be allowed and lastly, he submits that there being other tenants in the suit premises who have not been disturbed by the plaintiff there is no<em> bonafide</em> requirement of the land and, as such, the learned Assistant Judge committed no illegality in passing the impugned judgment and decree dismissing the suit.<br/> <br/>8. It appears that the plaintiff-petitioner filed the suit against the defendant for a decree of ejectment on the grounds that included a ground that the defendant was a defaulter but the specific case of the defendant is, that he is not at all a defaulter inasmuch as he deposited rent in the HR Case No. 5 of 1993. From Exhibit 7 judgment dated 29-6-95 passed in HR Case No.6 of 1995 (previously registered as HR Case No. 5 of 1993) it appears that the said HR Case filed by the defendant-opposite party was rejected by the trial Court. It is submitted on behalf of the defendant that against the aforesaid judgment he preferred Miscellaneous Appeal No.151 of 1995. It appears from Annexure 'X' filed by the plaintiff-petitioner along with supplementary affidavit that the said Miscellaneous Appeal has been dismissed on 28-2-96 by the learned District Judge. It further appears that the defendant-opposite party himself in his evidence admitted that the aforesaid Miscellaneous Appeal has been dismissed after hearing the parties. It has been further admitted categorically by the defendant-opposite party in his evidence that after disposal of both the cases i.e. HR Case No. 5 of 93/6 of 95 and Miscellaneous Appeal No.151 of 1995 he did not deposit any rent of the suit premises. Without going further deep into the matter it may be held that a tenant is protected from ejectment if he paid rent to the full extent permissible under the Ordinance and in view of section 18(1) of the House Rent Control Ordinance, it can be said that notwithstanding any thing contained in the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 or the Contract Act, 1872 no order or decree for recovery of possession can be made against a tenant so long as the tenant paid rent to the full extent allowable by the Ordinance and performs the condition of the tenancy.<br/> <br/>9. There is no dispute that the Miscellaneous Appeal was dismissed on 28-2-1996 while the suit in question was pending. According to own showing of the defendant, as stated above, it appears that he did not pay any rent whatsoever after the HR Case in question and also since 28-2-1996 i.e. date of disposal of the Miscellaneous Appeal in question. As such, it appears that the defendant’s liability for payment of the rent at least before the judgment passed in the suit in question, has not been discharged and the defendant did not pay rent according to his own showing and, therefore, is not protected under the law. It may further be held that once a tenant is a defaulter he is always a defaulter.<br/> <br/>10. Md. Fazlul Karim, learned Advocate for the plaintiff petitioner, referred to the case of <em><strong>Ramijan Ali Ministry Vs. Md. Hedayetullah </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> 31 DLR (AD) 183</strong></em> wherein the above principle of law has been elaborately discussed and settled. In view of the facts and circumstances and the position of law as decided in <em><strong>31 DLR</strong></em> case I cannot hold any opinion contrary to the law and find that the defendant opposite party is a defaulter. It is surprising to find that though issue No. 2 was framed by the trial Court for decision as to whether the defendant was a defaulter but no where in the judgment there is any finding as to this vital issue. On this ground alone the impugned judgment of the trial Court cannot stand in the eye of law.<br/> <br/>11. Regarding clauses ‘H, and ‘J’ appearing in the agreement learned Advocate for the defendant opposite party very strenuously argued that in view of the clauses plaintiff was not entitled to get decree of ejectment in the present suit.<br/> <br/>Clause H in the agreement appears as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“That the first party shall never be able to take over the possession of the shop room unless the second party agrees to hand over the possession of the same to the first party”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>12. But Clause H is to be read with clause B of the agreement. It appears that in Clause B the defendant tenant bound himself with the stipulation that in the event of the second party’s failure to pay the rent within 60 days from the date on which it was due, the first party shall be at liberty to terminate the tenancy of agreement. Moreover, the plaintiff asserted in the evidence that without knowledge of the plaintiff the above Clause H was inserted in the agreement. Moreover, there being provisions of section 18(5) in the Premises Rent Control Ordinance as to consequence of being a defaulter in payment of rent, the said law being a special law has got over-riding effect and, as such, mere insertion of this clause ‘H, itself cannot bar a citizen to seek reliefs in a Court of law which he is otherwise entitled to under the law of the land.<br/> <br/>13. Learned Advocate for the defendant-opposite party also referred to clause ‘J’ in the agreement which is as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“That in case of any dispute or differences between the parties to this agreement, an arbitrator may be appointed by representing equal members of either side or any decision made by this arbitrator is binding to the parties to this agreement.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>14. From the aforesaid clause “J” it appears that an option was given to the parties for appointment of arbitrator in case of any dispute or difference between the parties of this agreement.<br/> <br/>15. It appears from the cross-examination of P.W. 1 (plaintiff) that he deposed that before filing the suit he tried for settlement of the dispute and took steps for settlement of the dispute privately which was attended by other tenants also and that he called <em>salish </em>(Arbitration) with the local elite and this evidence clearly indicates that the plaintiff called <em>salish</em> before filing the suit. He however admitted that he did not file any application before the Ward Commissioner for holding arbitration. He further deposed that the<em> salish</em> took place in the house of the defendant and the defendant was present there. Learned Advocate for the defendant-petitioner however referred to the evidence of this witness revealed in his cross-examination wherein he stated that neither the plaintiff, nor the defendant followed the clause of the agreement as to arbitration.<br/> <br/>16. Learned Advocate for the plaintiff-petitioner submits that even in case of any arbitration clause in the agreement it was the duty of the defendant to resort to section 34 of the Arbitration Act but no such step being taken the point cannot be agitated now. More so, such step by filing application for arbitration could be taken in the Court before filing the written statement. He further submits that there being non fulfillment of obligation by the defendant the plaintiff filed the suit with reference to section 35 of the Arbitration Act and in view of the evidence of plaintiff revealed in his cross-examination that attempts for amicable disposal/arbitration being made, the clause as to arbitration cannot stand as a legal bar against the plaintiff to get a decree in the suit. In view of the facts and circumstances and evidence on record it appears that the submission made by the learned Advocate of the plaintiff-petitioner is not bereft of substance. In any view of the matter defendant being found to be a defaulter, is not entitled to any protection of ejectment according to provision of Premises Rent Control Ordinance or Transfer of Property Act. As stated above there being no finding whatsoever on this vital point in the impugned judgment I am satisfied that the judgment suffers from illegality.<br/> <br/>17. Since I find illegality in the judgment on point of default of the defendant-tenant I do not like to embark upon other question as to the claim of<em> bonafide</em> requirement of the landlord which shall be a mere useless exercise. In view of the discussion made above it appears that the impugned judgment being illegal is liable to be interfered and is therefore liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/>18. In the result, the Rule is made absolute without any order as to costs. The impugned judgment and decree passed by the Assistant Judge and SCC Judge, Dhaka dated 22-11-1996 in SCC Suit No.3 of 1994 are set aside. The aforesaid SCC Suit No. 3 of 1994 is decreed on contest against the defendant without any order as to cost, plaintiffs do get possession of the suit premises evicting the defendant tenant if he does not vacate the suit premises within 60 (sixty) days.<br/> <br/>Send down the lower Court record at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
