It appears that the learned District Judge failed to understand the provisions of Section 18 of Rent Control ordinance. The learned District Judge also appears to have no basic knowledge about House Rent law and the meaning of defaulter under the monthly tenancy laws. A tenant defaulting in payment of rent for a single month is a defaulter and continuous to be a defaulter. Thus there-being no proof of payment of rent for the aforesaid for 29 months the offer of payment of one month’s rent to become a regular rent payee is an absurd proposition. Accordingly, the leave petitioner being defaulter the decision of the High Court Division is to be interfered with. Further the leave petitioners being defaulters and they having claimed to have inherited the tenancy right, they are bound by the notice under Section106 of the Transfer of Property Act, served upon their father, the original tenant, and thus the leave petitioner cannot resist the eviction case. Therefore the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division do not call for any interference. …. (10)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Lawyers Involved: </strong><br/>T.H.

The leave peti­tion No.878 of 2008 arises out of Civil Revision No.1310 of 1996 arising out of the judgment and order dated30.09.1995 passed in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 82 of 1995 by the Additional District Judge, 4th court, Dhaka, which was filed against the judgment and order dated 29.03.1995 passed in House Rent Case No. 34 of 1982 by the Assistant Judge (House Rent Controller), Dhaka, and the leave Petition No. 879 of 2008 arises out of Civil Revision No.201 of 1995 arising out of the judgment and order dated 24.09.1984 passed in S.C.C. Suit No.195 of 1984. Both the cases are between the same par­ties and arises out of the common fact and same property and the High Court Division disposed of both the Rules issued in the Civil Revision Case No.1310 of 1996 and 201 of 1995 by a single judg­ment an order.<br/> <br/>2. The petitioners of both the leave peti­tions are same-tenants and the respondent No.1 is the landlord.<br/> <br/>3. The relevant facts are that the father of the petitioners was a tenant under the landlord-Bigrah and that a notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act was served on the tenant for vacating the suit premises, wherein the father of the leave petitioners, was a monthly ejectable tenant, and that the leave petitioners got themselves substituted in the cases before the High Court Division.  Earlier their attempts for substitution failed before the courts below. The House Rent Case was filed by the tenant for deposit of rents stat­ing that the father of the petitioners was a monthly tenant and paid rent upto Agrahayan 1388 B. S. and that after his death the petitioner became the tenants by way of inheritance and that the rent offered for the month of Poush 1388 B. S. was refused and accordingly the rent was sent though postal money order, which returned unpaid with endorsement that the addressee found absent. The landlord entered appearance and filed written objection denying the claim of the tenants and alleging that they have been sued for eviction and that the tenants did not pay any rent since Shrabon 1386 B. S. The Rent Controller dismissed the case hold­ing that the tenants did not pay rents for the 29 months prior to sending of the money order for the month of Poush 1388 B. S. and thereby they are defaulters and hence under Section 18 (5) of the House Rent controller ordinance they are not entitle to deposit rent under Section 19(1) of the House Rent Control ordinance.<br/> <br/>4. Being aggrieved, the petitioner moved the appellate Court in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 82 of 1995 before the District Judge, Dhaka, which on transfer was heard and disposed of by the learned Additional District Judge, 4th Court, Dhaka, allowing the appeal holding, amongst others, that: <br/> <br/>"It is stated in Section 18(1) (5) that so long a tenant paid rent to the full extent he is not defaulter. It has no stated anything about rents. So it indi­cates one month's rent to its full extent. So when in this case petition­ers deposited rent of one month to its full extent which was indirectly refused by the landlord O. P. /respon­dents through their shebait. Admittedly O.P. duties are the own­ers of the case premises. I think the House Rent Controller has no scope to reject the petition of the petitioner under Section 19 (1), for depositing rent of the case premises. It is also to be mentioned here that in the premis­es Rent Control ordinance there is no mention of any time limit for the deposit of arrear rents. Time is fixed for deposit of one months rent only and House Rent Controller must receive the rent to its full extent that is one month rent to its full extent. If any body makes part payment he is defaulter. Here is this case Tenant-petitioner / appellants deposited the rent of the months of Poush 1388 B. S. to its full extent and submitted application under Section 19 (1) of the Premises Rent Control ordinance 1963 for depositing rent in the office of the House Rent Controller." <br/> <br/>5. The learned Advocate for the petitioner submitted that the aforesaid finding of the learned District Judge is preposterous inasmuch as the proposition in making a defaulter in payment of rent for 29 months a regular rent payer only on payment of one month's rent cannot be sustained. The learned District Judge appears to have failed to understand the provisions of Section 18 of the Rent Control ordinance as well as the meaning of defaulter under the tenancy laws.<br/> <br/>6. The S.C.C. Suit No.195 of 1984 has been dismissed by the S.C.C. Court observing, amongst others, that the tenants were not proved as defaulters and that there is no bonafide requirement of the premises by the landlord inasmuch as the suit was filed after three years of issuance of the legal notices and that some of the defendant tenants have been depositing rent in the Court and that no notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act was served upon the legal heirs of ten­ant Lai Chan, who claimed to have inherited the tenancy, and fresh notice upon them is required.<br/> <br/>7.  Being aggrieved, the landlord moved the High Court Division under Section 25 of the S. C.C. Act, 1887 in Civil Revision No.201of 1995. The High Court Division on detailed discussions on the materials available on record made  the Rule absolute, setting aside the judgment and decree dated 29.09.1994 passed in S.C.C. Suit No.195 of 1984 by the Assistant Judge, 1st Court, Dhaka, and thereby decreed the S.C. C. suit allowing the prayer.<br/> <br/>8. The High Court Division disposed of both the Civil Revision Cases being Civil Revision No. 201 of 1995 and Civil Revision No.1310 of 1996 by the same judgment and order.<br/> <br/>9. The learned Advocate appearing for the leave petitioner submitted that the leave petitioners inherited the tenancy and no notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act has been served upon them. The case as filed for eviction under the S. C. C. Act is not maintainable and the High Court Division has erred in law in allowing the S.C. C. Suit for eviction and that the finding of the High court Division as to bona fide requirement is against the materials on record and that the High Court Division erred in law in not considering that the plaintiff is to prove his case and he cannot get a decree on the weakness of the defendants and that the suit has been filed after three years of issuance of notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. The suit was barred by limitation and that the High Court Division failed to consider that the tenants have been paying rent regularly. The learned Advocate in respect of the case for deposit of house rent submitted that the High Court Division erred in law in not accepting the finding of the appellate court below, which has found the leave petitioners as not defaulters.<br/> <br/>10. We have perused the leave petition as well as the judgments in reference of the respective cases. We have considered the submissions made by the learned Advocate for the leave petitioners. From the materials on record, it appears that the leave petitioners failed to prove their assertion of their payment of rent for the period of Shrabon 1386 B.S. to Agrahayan 1388 B.S. The decision of the learned District Judge in allowing the House Rent Control Case of the leave petitioners holding that payment of one month rent will make a tenant "not defaulter”, in spite of being an admitted defaulter in payment of 29 months rent, is against law. It appears that the learned District Judge failed to understand the provisions of Section 18 of Rent Control ordinance. The learned District Judge also  appears to have no basic knowledge about  House Rent law and the meaning of defaulter under the monthly tenancy laws, A tenant defaulting in payment of rent for a single month is a defaulter and continuous to be a defaulter. Thus there-being no proof of payment of rent for the aforesaid  for 29 months the offer of payment of one month's rent to become a regular rent payee is an absurd proposition. Accordingly, the leave petitioner being defaulter the decision of the High Court Division is not to be inferred with.<br/> <br/>Further the leave petitioners being default­ers and they having claimed to have inher­ited the tenancy right, they are bound by the notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, served upon their father, the original tenant, and thus the leave petitioner cannot resist the evic­tion case. Therefore the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division do not call for any interference.<br/> <br/>11. Accordingly, both the leave petitions being Civil Petition for leave to Appeal No. 878 of 2008 and civil petition for leave to Appeal No. 879 of 2008 are dis­missed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
