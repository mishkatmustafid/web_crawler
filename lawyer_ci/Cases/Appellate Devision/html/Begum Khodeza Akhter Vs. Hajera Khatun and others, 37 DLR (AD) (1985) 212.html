The ques­tion involved in these appeals is whether the pre-emption has been allowed under section 24 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949, to the respondents on correct appreciation of fact and proper application of law.<br/> <br/>2. Respondents, Pre-emptors filed two proceedings, Miscellaneous Cases Nos. 250 of 1974 and 12 of 1975 in the Court of Munsif, Brahmanbaria, claiming pre-emption of two lands which were sold by two kabalas, one dated 18 December 1973 (Ext. A4) and the other dated 19 December 1973 (Ext. A3). These two pieces of land were part of a bigger area of land comprising Plots Nos. 329 and 332 which originally belonged to one Sarala Bala Pal, a fact about which there is no dis­pute. Respondents by two sale-deeds Exts. 4 and 5, dated 16 May 1969, purchased 26 decimals of land from plot No. 332 and 4½  decimals of land from plot No. 329 and thereby became co-sharers of Sarala Bala Pal. Area of land in Plot No. 332 was 7 decimals, but about one decimal of land was covered up by a public road. While going to take possession they found 9 decimals of land out of 6 decimals of Plot No.332 had already been sold to Hiralal Basak and Narendra Chandra Basak by two sale-deeds in 1963, as such, the respondents got possession of only 18 decimals of land in Plot No. 332, This area in Plot No.332 together with 4½ decimals in plot No. 339 brought the total area of land purchased by them to 22½ decimals. Thereafter Hiralal and Narendra transferred their entire share of 9 decimals to Nurul Alam by two kabalas Exts. A4 and A3 dated 18-12-73 and 19-12-73 respectively as already stated above, and these two kabalas are sought to be pre-empted. During the pendency of these proceedings Nurul Alam sold away half of the land to Peano Begum, and the other half to Abdur Razzak. These transferees then transferred their shares, that are .09 decimals, to the appellant Khadija Akhter, the pre-emptee, and it is she who ultimately resisted the preemption. The grounds taken by her are that the applications for pre-emption are barred by limitation, that the proposed pre-emption is hit by the rule as to bar of partial pre-emption and that the Pre-emptors are no  longer co-sharers in the land as they got their share and jama separated by filing a Separation Case, No. 605/69-70. The learned Munsif rejected all these contentions and allowed pre-emption. On appeal the learned Subordinate Judge re­versed the findings of the trial Court and disallowed pre-emption. The decision of the learned Subordinate Judge was challenged be­fore the High Court Division by two separate revisional applications—C.R. Nos. 394  and 399 of 1978—with the result that this  deci­sion was reversed and that of the trial Court restored by the impugned  judgment dated 21 January 1982.<br/> <br/>3. Mr. Khondkar Mahbubuddin Ahmed lear­ned Advocate for the appellant, first urged two grounds before us, one as to partial pre-emp­tion and the other as to separation of the jama. Before taking up these two points it should be mentioned here that the lower Appellate Court allowed the appeals and refused pre-emption mainly on the ground of limitation. But in coming to this finding the lower Appellate Court ignored the legal provisions that limita­tion starts from the data of registration of the sale-deeds, exts. A4 and A3. The learned Single Judge of the High Court Division reversed this finding, and computing the period of limitation from the date of registration of the two kabalas, found that the pre-emption cases were filed well within the period of limitation. This finding has not been challenged in these two appeals before us, and as such, the finding as to limitation is concluded in favour of the Pre-emptors.<br/> <br/>4. As to the question of partial pre-emption, the learned Advocate of the appellant contends that the pre-emption was sought in respect of a part of the lands sold by Hiralal and Narendra to Nurul Alam. But Mr. S.M. Hossain, learned Advocate for the respondents, has contended that the entire area of 9 decimals of land which was transferred by Hiralal and Narendra by the two kabalas, Exts. A4 and A3, dated 18 December 1973 and 19 Decem­ber 1973, has been sought to be pre-empted and as such it is not a case of partial pre-emp­tion. Mr. Khondkar Mahbubuddin has tried to argue that this 9 decimals of land sought to be pre-empted comprises Plot No.332 only, whereas the vendors, Hiralal and Narendra, transferred the land comprising both the plots, 329 and 332, and that 4½ decimals of land sold from Plot No. 329 was exclu­ded from the pre-emption cases. This sub­mission is wrong obviously, for the total area of land purchased by Hiralal and Narendra in 1963 was 9 decimals; and this 9 decimals of land was transferred by them to Nurul Alam by the two kabalas Exts. A4 and A3 and it is this 9 decimals of land which has been sought to be pre-empted in its entirety. The pre-emption cases clearly show that whatever the area of land Hiralal and Narendra transferred to Nurul Alam is being sought to be pre-empted and out of it nothing has been left out. Mr. Khondkar Mahbub­uddin Ahmed, in view of this position, has given up this contention, conceding that it is not a case of partial pre-emption. As such this point is also concluded in favour of the Preemptors. But judgment of the trial Court does not clearly show if the consideration of both the kabalas under pre-emption has been deposited in full. If not it shall have to be deposited at once.<br/> <br/>5. The main contention of Mr. Mahbubuddin Ahmed centres round the question of separation of the jama by the Pre­emptors. It has been contended that the pre-emptors, after their purchase of 22½ decimals of lands from the original owner Saralabala Pal in 1969, filed an application before the Revenue-officer for separation of their jama whereupon a Separation Case, bearing No.605/69-70, was started which ended in an order separating the jama whereupon the two parties paid rents separately. If this is a fact, then, certainly the Pre-emptors ceased to be co-sharers and are debarred from claiming pre-emption. But there is neither any specific finding by any of the three Courts including the High Court Division on this question, nor is there any sufficient evid­ence on record to determine it. Paradoxically the question as to separation of jama was first raised, not by the Pre-emptee, but by the Pre-emptors themselves in their applica­tions for pre-emption. They stated there that they mutated their names by separating the jama by filing Separation Case No. 605/69-70. Treating this as an admission, the pre-emptee built up her case as the separation of the jama resulting in the Pre-emptors ceasing to be co-sharers in the original jama. Excepting this statement which is apparently an admis­sion against the interest of, its maker, there is no evidence that the jama was actually separated and the lands were recorded under separate khatians. The copy of a proposed khatian No. 997/1 has been produced before us by the appellant-pre-emptee at the time of hearing of the appeals. It shows that a proposal was under consideration of the Revenue-officer for opening up a sep­arate khatian in favour of the respondents in   respect of an area of 30½ decimals comprising both plot Nos.329 and 332; but whether the proposal was finally accepted resulting in separation of the jama and payment of rents separately by the two co-sharers, no evidence has been led in this case. So far as the Pre-emptors are concerned, they are not expected to adduce any evid­ence in this matter as this will certainly go against them. As to why they filed the Separa­tion case, they have now explained that by filing the separation case only mutation of their names in place of the original owner Sarala Bala Pal was intended and that the proposal for mutation was erroneously referred to "as separation of the jama" and further, that the said case did not reach its finality; consequently, they continued to be co-sharers. As to the Pre-emptee, as already stated above, she also did not produce any evidence but solely depended upon the 'admission’ of the other party. 'Admission' is no doubt a strong evidence against sis maker, but it is also open to him to adduce evidence to show that it is not in fact an "admission' but is the result of bonafide mistake of fact. The appel­late Court left the issue undecided by a simple observation that "since the onus lies on the petitioner (Pre-emptor) to prove it and he failed to prove it the benefit of doubt goes to the O.P. (Pre-emptee)". The learned Single Judge of the High Court Division held that it was a case of mutation, but at the same time observed that "since  the Pre-emptors were owners of only a part of the land but clai­med mutation for the whole of, it, it was not a case of mutation at all". In the circumstances, it is found that this all-important question as to separation of the jama-whether the pre-emptors are co-sharers in the land, in other words, whether the jama has been actually separated and rent paid separately has not been decided by any of the Courts. Upon determination of this question the fate of 'the two pre-emption proceedings depend, and this question sho­uld better be determined by the lower Appellate Court.<br/> <br/>6. In the result, the impugned order of the High Court Division is set aside, both the appeals are allowed and the cases are sent on remand to the lower Appellate Court to determine the question as to separation of the jama on consideration of evidence including fresh evidence if adduced by the parties, and to dispose of the appeals before it—namely Miscellaneous Appeals Nos.30 and 18 of 1977 keeping in view that two other questions, one as to limitation and other as to partial pre-emption, have been finally decided in favour of the Pre-emptors. No order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
