The High Court Division could itself interfere, notwithstanding correctly observing that there was an alternative remedy under section 7 of the Ordinance, in view of the particular facts of the case.

Afzal J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This appeal by leave is from Judgment and Order dated 13 February, 1989 passed by the High Court Division (Dhaka Bench) in Writ Petition No. 316 of 1986 discharging the rule.<br/> <br/>2. The appellant filed the aforesaid writ peti­tion calling upon the respondents to show cause as to why the impugned notification dated 28.4.86 (Annexure 'E' to the Writ Petition) insofar as it relates to the appellant's house, at serial No. 41 under the heading 'Motijheel Commercial Area' shall not be declared to have been passed without lawful authority and be of no legal effect.<br/> <br/>3. The appellant suited in her petition that she purchased the land measuring .70 acres with a two-storiyed residential house at holding No. 10/1 Toyenbee Circular Road, Dhaka pertaining to C.S. Plot No. 33, R.S. Plot Nos. 2411, 2412 &amp; 2413 of C.S. Khatian No. 6147 (U) and R.S. Khatian No. 390 of Mouza Shahar Dhaka in 1951 to the extent of .66 acres and in 1955 to the extent of 6 acres by regis­tered Sale Deeds and since then she had been enjoy­ing and performing acts of ownership and possession by residing in the house and paying rents and taxes to the Government and other local authorities. The husband of the appellant was a politician belonging to the Muslim League Party. He was out of Bangla­desh at the time of liberation of the country. The ap­pellant's house at 10/1, Toyenbee Circular Road, Dhaka and her other properties were attached by the government of Bangladesh as collaborator's proper­ties under The Bangladesh Collaborators (Special Tri­bunal) Order, 1972 (P.O. 8 of 1972) on the mis­information that these properties might belong to Mr. Wahiduzzaman, husband of the appellant. In view of the order of attachment the appellant had to vacate the said house and thereafter an investigation was made at the instance of the appellant with regard to the right title, interest and possession of the said house. The Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of Bangladesh, The respondent No. 3 by memo dated 9.10.1975 released the said property along with the appellant's other house at 2, Nanda Lal Dutta Lane, Dhaka from attachment. The release order is Annexure 'B'. The properties belonging to Mr. Wahiduzzaman were also released by The Govt. His citizenship was restored and he died in Bangladesh in 1976. The appellant received delivery of possession of the said property and afterwards leased it out to the Parjaton Corporation vide lease deed dated 9.12.76, Annexure 'C. The lease was terminated in 1980 and since then the appellant has been enjoying peaceful and undis­turbed possession of the said properly through three of her sons, Habibuzzaman, Rashiduzzaman &amp; Sinku Akramuzzaman who have jointly set up an office for their various businesses in the said house and have also been using part of it in storing equipments and other merchandise connected with their business. She asserted that the house had never been declared or treated as abandoned property nor taken possession of by the Govt. in any manner under the President's Or­der No. 16 of 1972. The appellant was surprised to see the public notice dated 28.4.86 published in The Bangladesh Gazelle Extra-ordinary on 28.4.86 under the provisions of section 5(1)(a) of the Abandoned Buildings (Supplementary Provisions) Ordinance, 1985 (Ordinance No. LIV of 1985) (hereinafter re­ferred to as the Ordinance) wherein the appellant's said house has been included in the said notice as an abandoned property the possession of which had al­legedly been taken as abandoned property under P.O. No. 16 of 1972. The appellant asserted that she is in possession of the said house and the respondents or anybody else on their behalf have not taken possession of the said property nor served any notice to in­clude the said house in the list of abandoned proper­ties.<br/> <br/>4. Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 contested the writ petition by filing an affidavit-in-opposition. It was contended, inter alia, that the appellant had never been in possession of the house in question, that the same is occupied by the police and presently being used as police box and office. During the War of Liberation and afterwards the whereabouts of the owner were not known, the owner ceased to manage, supervise and control the said house in person and that The government, accordingly, took over the property as abandoned property. It was also stated that on the application dated 22.8.72 of one Waheed Kamal, Proprietor of Rup-Rekha, an enquiry was made concerning the said house by the Executive En­gineer, Railway Division (Building) at the instance of the Ministry of Works, On the basis of the enquiry report a demand notice was issued against the said Waheed Kamal dated 8.7.72 and rental compen­sation amounting to Tk. 2,280/-was realised from him with effect from 1.1.72 to 30.6.74. Subsequent­ly the house was occupied by the Superintendent of Police. It was submitted that the proper forum for adjudication of the matter is the Court of Settlement which has been specially constituted under the Ordi­nance for the purpose of settling the disputes regard­ing abandoned properties.<br/> <br/>5. In her affidavit-in-reply the appellant denied that the said house was ever occupied by the Superintendent of Police, Dhaka and that it is being used as a Police Box and Office. She reiterated that the said house is very much in her possession. She stat­ed that she received back possession of the said house by virtue of memo dated 9.7.75 (Annexure 'B') and thereafter she is in continuous possession of the said house.<br/> <br/>6. It is found from the impugned judgment that as there was dispute with regard to the present pos­session of the house in question, the High Court Di­vision by its order dated 7.12.88 directed the Mini­stry of Home Affairs, respondent No. 3, to file an affidavit staling whether the Police was in posses­sion of the disputed premises as contended by the re­spondent Nos. 1 and 2 in their affidavit-in-opposition. It is also found that no affidavit was filed by the Ministry of Home Affairs within the lime allowed by The Court nor even after further lime was taken by the learned Assistant Attorney-General for the purpose. Indeed no affidavit was eventually filed confirming the assertion as to possession by the Police made by respondent Nos. 1 and 2. Thus the appellant's assertion of possession remained prac­tically uncontroverted.<br/> <br/>7. The learned Judges, however, took the view that the writ petition was not maintainable as there was an alternative remedy available under section 7 of the Ordinance and accordingly discharged the rule by the impugned judgment.<br/> <br/>8. Leave was granted to consider whether in view of the special facts and circumstances of the case the High Court Division acted properly in de­clining jurisdiction to interfere on the ground of al­ternative remedy.<br/> <br/>9. Mr. H.R. Sharif, learned counsel for the ap­pellant, submitted that the High Court Division wrongly declined to exercise jurisdiction in that it failed to notice that the appellant had no remedy un­der the Ordinance at the time when the writ petition was filed and rule issued inasmuch as the Court of settlement was constituted tong after the filing of the writ petition. The learned counsel also submitted that the inclusion of the appellant's house in the im­pugned notification was ex-facie bad and without ju­risdiction inasmuch as it was neither an abandoned property nor was it ever taken over as such by the government al any lime and, therefore, the High Court Division ought to have granted the relief prayed for instead of driving the appellant to the court of settlement after about three years of enter­taining the writ petition.<br/> <br/>10. The learned Additional Attorney-General has, however, supported the view taken by the High Court Division that the writ petition was incompe­tent as the relief prayed for therein could be sought and obtained even now from the court of settlement under section 7 of the Ordinance. He has also drawn our attention to the fact that the High Court Divi­sion advisedly refrained from giving any finding as to whether the disputed property was liable to be de­clared as an abandoned property or as to whether the appellant or any of the respondents were in posses­sion of the same. The learned Additional Attorney-General submitted that the matter should be decided in the court of settlement as indicated, according to him rightly, by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>11. It appears that the High Court Division upon examining the different provisions of the Ordi­nance including section 7 came to the finding that the said section can give the appellant exactly the same remedy which she was praying for in the petition, that the court of settlement has been given the specific power to exclude the disputed property from the impugned list, that the appellant has been given specific right to argue before the court of settlement that the building is not an abandoned properly, that it has not vested in the govt. and that her right or in­terest in the building has not been affected by the provisions of P.O. 16 of 1972. When the Statute has devised an alternative forum for giving complete relief to the appellant, the learned Judges observed, she could not invoke the writ jurisdiction without exhausting the remedy provided for in the Ordinance.<br/> <br/>12. The aforesaid view taken by the High Court Division, generally speaking, is well in accord with the scaled principle governing exercise of discretionary jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution when the law itself provides for a remedy which is sought for in the writ petition. We, therefore, have no reason to interfere with the impugned judgment on the ground that any principle has been laid down which cannot be justified. Even so the facts of the present case as revealed are such that it is found plainly difficult to sustain the ultimate order refusing to interfere with the impugned notification. It will be seen that section 5(1)(a) of the Ordinance under which the impugned notification was pub­lished authorises the government to publish in the Official Gazette (a) a list of buildings the possession of which has been taken as abandoned property under the President's Order (P.O. No. 16 of 1972). The minimum The Govt. must show in a proceeding where the publication of the list is challenged in respect of any properly by its owner, is that the prop­erty has al some point of lime been taken possession of as abandoned property. In the instant case there appears to be no clear assertion made by the respon­dents as to when the disputed house was taken over by the Govt. as abandoned properly and how the properly was being managed by the government since then. It has been merely asserted by the respon­dents that during and after the liberation struggle the whereabouts of the owner of the house were not known and the government rightly enlisted the prop­erly as abandoned properly, that the appellant was never in possession of the house and that it was oc­cupied by the S.P., Dhaka and it is being presently used as Police Box and Office.<br/> <br/>13. It will be observed that the assertions of the appellant that the disputed house was put under attachment as collaborators properly on wrong information, that after investigation of the right title, in­terest and possession of the appellant in respect of the said property, the Ministry of Home Affairs by memo dated 9.10.75 released the properly from at­tachment, that the appellant received delivery of pos­session of the said property and afterwards leased out the same to the Parjaton Corporation, that the lease was terminated in 1980 and the appellant's sons had been in possession of the properly since then and that the appellant had been paying rents regularly to the Government Acquired Estate have not been specifically denied by the respondents. From Annexure 'B', memo dated 9.10.75, it is clear that the house in question which was attached under P.O. 8 of 1972 was released from attachment by the Government. Mr. Sharif upon referring to Article 14 of P.O. 16 of 1972 submitted that if the property was really an abandoned property as contended by the respondents, it could not be a subject of attachment under the said Article 14 and the fact that it was actually attached (under P.O.8/72) disproved the contention of the Government that it was being treated as an aban­doned property. The respondents have not at all mentioned in their affidavit-in-opposition as to when the possession of the house was taken over cither before releasing the property from attachment or thereafter. The respondents' only case as to possession seems to be that Police came to possess the said house. They have not, however, said how? Be that as it may, the respondent No. 3, the Ministry of Home Affairs, in spite of being directed by the High Court Division to file an affidavit as to actual possession of the house as claimed by the contesting respondents failed to appear even before the Court, not to speak of claiming possession by the Police. Before us also the respondents have not made any effort to show the alleged possession by the police although the appel­lant has been claiming all the time openly and, if we may say so, bravely that she has been all along in possession since the release of the property in 1975. It appears that there is not a shred of paper to show that the government ever took possession of the house as abandoned property at any time and as to actual possession, the respondents have not brought any material to controvert the claim of possession made by the appellant. In such circumstances, it can­not but be held that the inclusion of the appellant's property in the impugned list was ex-facie without jurisdiction. The learned Additional Attorney-General failed to satisfy us as to how the Governments case would improve if the mailer were to be decided in the court of settlement. The learned Additional Attorney-General has not been able to controvert by the slightest material of whatever probative value that the appellant was not in possession of the house as claimed by her. In this situation we think it will be an idle ceremony to direct the appellant to go to the court of settlement for another round of formal litigation which is against all norms of administration of justice.<br/> <br/>14. The High Court Division, in our opinion, could itself interfere, notwithstanding correctly ob­serving that there was an alternative remedy under section 7 of the Ordinance, in view of the particular facts of the case. The Ordinance was promulgated on 28 November 1985 and the list under section 5 (1)(a) thereof was published in the gazette on 28.4.86. Section 7 provides that any person claiming any right or interest in any building which is included in the list may within a period of 108 (perhaps 180) days from the date of the publication of the list in the official gazette may make an application to the court of settlement for exclusion of the building from such list, etc. It is not disputed that although the notifica­tion was published on 28.4.86 the court of settlement was constituted on 21.10.86. The appellant filed the writ petition on 19.8.86, apparently at a time when the court of settlement was yet to be constituted. The High Court Division may not have admitted the petition at all because of the aforesaid pro­vision but having admitted the same, apparently being aware that the court of settlement was not con­stituted then, it was not quite proper 10 decline inter­ference after three years on the ground of alternative remedy, more so, having itself noticed that the Mini­stry of Home Affairs did not even come up with an affidavit to assert the presence of a Police Box as staled by the contesting respondents in their affidavit-in-opposition in spite of a specific direction in that behalf. The High Court Division would have been justified in taking the view that the Govern­ment was expected to be upright and fair in dealing with a citizen's property and the very fact that the Ministry of Home Affairs did not care to file an affi­davit could be held to be sufficient for the purpose of the present case disentitling the government from claiming possession and making a list including the appellant's property under the Ordinance. Since the High Court Division failed to give the necessary re­lief to the appellant, now it seems on a technical ground, we have fell that in order to do complete jus­tice in the mailer we ourselves should pass the necessary order.<br/> <br/>15. In view of the discussion above, the appeal is allowed without any order as to cost. It is declared that the impugned notification dated 28.4.86 (Annexure 'E' to the writ petition) insofar as it relates to the appellant's house at serial 41 under the heading 'Motijheel Commercial Area' has been made without lawful authority and is of no legal effect.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
