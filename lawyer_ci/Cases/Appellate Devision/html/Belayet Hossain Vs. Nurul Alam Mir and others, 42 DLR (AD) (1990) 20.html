Afzal J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>In this appeal by leave by the plaintiff-appellant the point for consideration is whether the High Court Division was justified in overturning an order of temporary injunction granted by the First Appellate Court.<br/> <br/>2. Material facts of the case are that the plain­tiff-appellant took settlement of 2.73 acres of land in several plots of S.A. Khatian No. 162 of Mouza Haybatpur from the Government in P.S. Case No. 889 of 1965-66. The order of settlement was, how­ever, cancelled on 10.3.81 on the allegation that the appellant had transferred the aforesaid land to his brothers by registered kabalas without the settlement being finally approved. The appellant brought O.C. Suit No. 141 of 1981 in the Court of Assistant Judge, Natore on 14.3.81 for a declaration that the cancellation of settlement was illegal, etc. and also for permanent injunction against defendant-respondents. He also prayed for an order of temporary injunction by filing an application on the same date.<br/> <br/>3. The respondents opposed the prayer for tem­porary injunction by filing separate written objec­tions. They contended that since the plaintiff had transferred some land in contravention of the rule s of settlement, he was not entitled to an order of injunc­tion.<br/> <br/>4. The learned Assistant Judge granted an ad interim injunction but upon hearing the parties va­cated the same by order dated 23.6.81. It was hold by the Assistant Judge that the plaintiff had failed to prove any arguable case. On appeal by the plaintiff the learned Additional District Judge, Rajshahi by judgment and order dated 26.7.84 set aside the order of the learned Munsif and granted temporary injunc­tion till disposal of the suit.<br/> <br/>5. Respondent No. 1 then went in revision be­fore the High Court Division, Rangpur Bench. A learned Single Judge who heard the matter by the im­pugned judgment and order dated 19 August 1985 set aside the order of the Additional District Judge and restored that of the Assistant Judge. The plaintiff be­ing aggrieved by the said judgment and order came to this Division and obtained leave to appeal.<br/> <br/>6. Mr. Shaukat Ali Khan, learned counsel for the appellant, submitted that whether the settlement with the appellant had been legally cancelled was to be decided in the suit and until such determination it could not be said that the plaintiff was a trespasser upon the suit land merely because there was an order of cancellation by the authority, that the High Court Division erred in holding that the appellant was a trespasser and further rejecting the order of temporary injunction upon such erroneous view. The learned advocate-on-record for respondent No. 1, on the other hand, submitted that the plaintiff having already transferred the land in favour of his brothers even be­fore execution of kabuliyat he was not entitled to an order of injunction.<br/> <br/>7. The High Court Division relied upon some decisions in which it has been said that a person in wrongful possession of property is not entitled to be protected against the lawful owner by an order of in­junction and then a trespasser also is not entitled to perpetual injunction against the owner of properly. These principles arc not in dispute but in a case of cancellation of settlement it cannot be said that the lessee is a trespasser merely because his settlement has been cancelled. The question will always remain for consideration whether the settlement has been validly cancelled. This is precisely the argument made on behalf of the appellant.<br/> <br/>8. In our opinion, it is not necessary to attrib­ute trespass to the appellant to deny him the relief of temporary injunction. It is sufficient lo lake notice of his own case in that he has himself stated in his plaint that after taking permanent settlement there was some transfer of land to his brother and other re­lation with condition to re-purchase. It is his further case that kabuliyat has not yet been executed. On his own showing he has made a transfer of land appar­ently before his own settlement was completed. Thus he having parted with the land under proposed settlement, he was not entitled to an order of injunc­tion to maintain his alleged possession.<br/> <br/>9. The respondent No. 1 has filed a photostat copy of the certified copy of the ordersheet in Case No. 647/80 (Rs. Case 883/XIII/65-66) of the Office of Sub-Divisional Manager, Government Acquired Estate. Il is found from order dated 11.2.81 that there was a local enquiry and it was found that the appel­lant had transferred the settled lands to his brothers by registered deeds long ago and they had been enjoy­ing the interest and produce since the transfer. The appellant claimed before the S.D.O. on 3.2.81 that the land under settlement was under his possession covering house, etc. but this was found not to be a fact.<br/> <br/>10. In the above circumstances the learned As­sistant Judge appears to have rightly refused the prayer for temporary injunction on 23.6.81. It also appears that he fixed the suit for disposal on 21.7.81. The plaintiff, however, seemed to have bet­ter idea and he went on appeal and ultimately ob­tained an order of temporary injunction three years thereafter i.e. on 26.7.84. This order was, however, set aside by the learned Judge of the High Court Division on 19 August 1985 and a direction was given to dispose of the suit within three "months. Again the plaintiff has better idea and he came up to this Division chasing the relief of temporary injunction. The suit which should have been disposed of 8 years ago has perhaps remained pending and the plaintiff went on enjoying the benefit of temporary injunc­tion by legal contrivance of pursuing the said relief from one court to another. It is obvious that the temporary injunction is the only concern of the plaintiff and not the disposal of the suit which was fixed for hearing on 21.7.81. In the circumstances we sec no reason to interfere with the impugned or­der passed by the High Court Division even though the reason given by the learned Judge for the order docs not appeal lo us.<br/><br/>11. In the result, therefore, the appeal is dis­missed without any order as to cost.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
