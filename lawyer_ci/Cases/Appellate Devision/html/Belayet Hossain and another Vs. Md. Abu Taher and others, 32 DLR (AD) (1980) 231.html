The question involved and the decision proposed to be given does not call for any detailed recounting of facts, except that the appellants being pre-emptees is Mis­cellaneous Case No. 222 of 1974 of the first Court of Munsif at Lakshmipur, Noakhali filed an application under Order IX, rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure for setting aside the <em>ex parte</em> order allowing pre emption un­der section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 alleging that the pre-emptor obtained the <em>ex parte</em> order through fraudulent suppression of the processes. The case was dismissed on contest. Against the order the appellants moved the High Court Division in revision whereupon Rule was issued but ultimately it was discharged on the ground that an order passing an <em>ex parte</em> decree in a pre-emption case is also appealable under Order 43 of the Code and as such the revisional application without, preferring an appeal was not maintainable" The view taken by the learned Judge that the order was appealable and dismissal of the application under section 115 of the Code of Civil Proce­dure without hearing it on merits is under challenge.<br/> <br/>2. After hearing the learned Counsel on both sides it appears that the questions has been well settled by a series of decision star­ting from 1949 till today. It is true that the earlier decisions are with regard to section 26F of the Bengal Tenancy Act but the mat­erial provisions of section 26F of the B. T. Act and those of section 96 of the East Bengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Act substan­tially the same. The interpretation given earlier does not militate with the language of section 96 of the Act and so applicable to the section as well. Of the current of decisions three are reported which have been cited at the Bar.<br/> <br/>3. The first decision is by <strong>Akram C. J.</strong> in the case of <em><strong>Haji</strong></em><em><strong> Md.</strong></em><em><strong> Jayan Ali vs. Raju</strong></em> <em><strong>Pramanik 53 C.W.N. (1DR</strong></em>) 61. It was held that no appeal lies under the Civil proce­dure Code against an order dismissing an application under Order, 9 rule 13 of the Code for restoring a proceeding under section, 26F of the Bengal Tenancy Act which had been disposed of <em>ex parte</em>. The reason given for so holding is that an order dismissing an ap­plication under section 26F of the B.T. Act is not a decree and so does not come within the clear language of Order 43, rule 1(d) of the Code. The second reason is that section 141 of the Code refers merely to the proce­dure which is to be followed in all procee­dings in any civil Court which are no suits. It does not confer any right of appeal the right of appeal being a substantive right and not mere procedure must be given by statute and cannot be assumed and there is no appeal provided by the Code against an order dismissing an application under Odr 9, rule 13 for rest­oring a proceeding under section 96 F of the Bengal Tenancy Act, disposed of <em>ex parte</em>.<br/> <br/>4. It therefore, appears that on two grounds the appeal was held not to lie from an order dismissing an application to set aside an <em>ex-parte</em> order under section 26F of the B. T. Act. Firstly, the order is not a decree, and secondly, the order was not passed in a Suit and in terms of section 141 of the Code and in a proceeding other than a suit in the civil Court the provisions of the Code regarding trial procedure only will apply.<br/> <br/>5. The next decision is by <strong>Ibrahim, J.</strong> in <em><strong>Seferaiddi Munshi vs. Farman Ali Mirdha 4 DLR 621</strong></em>. This decision followed the case of <em><strong>Haji Md. Jayen Ali</strong></em> and held that an order rejecting an application to set aside an <em>ex parte</em> order passed In an application under section 26F of the B.T. Act does not become appealable under section 43, rule 1 (d) of the Code. In this decision only the first reason given by <strong>Akram C.J.</strong> was reiterated.<br/> <br/>The third decision is by a Division Bench of the High Court Division consisting of <strong>K.M. Subhan, and Afzal, JJ,</strong> in the case of <em><strong>A. Jafar vs. A. Hamid 29 DLR 306</strong></em>. The matter arose out of an application under section 96 of the East Bengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950. This case referred to a number of decisions including those of <em><strong>Haji Md. Jayen Ali and Seferaiddi</strong></em> and some unreported cases and concurred with the earlier view.<br/> <br/>7. On consideration of <em>ratio decidendi</em> of the cited decision, we do not find any reason to take a different view and disturb the long settled decisions followed by the High Court Division and its predecessor High Court on the question for the last thirty years. Apart from the question of disturbing the <em>stare decisis</em> the decisions are based on good reasons. The State Acquisition and Tenancy Act does not provide for any appeal from such an order. The Civil Procedure Code provides appeal from an order rejecting ap­plication to set aside a decree passed ex-pane made in a suit. The application of this rule presupposes existence to two conditions which are absent in an order so passed in a proceeding under section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act. The first is that the order of refusal is to set aside an <em>ex-parte</em> decree and the second, that the order is passed in a proceeding which is a suit. None of the conditions being present, the view so long held does not call for any revision.<br/> <br/>8. For the foregoing reasons the view taken by the learned Single Judge cannot be sustai­ned. This appeal is allowed and the order of the High Court Division is set aside and the case is remitted back to the High Court Division for disposal in accordance with law. There will be no order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
