Abdul Matin J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>These petitions for leave to appeal are directed against the judgment and order dated 3-10-2007 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.1887 of 1990 heard analogously with Civil Revision No. 1888 of 1990 discharging the Rattle arising out of judgment and decree dated 5-4-1990 and 26-5-1990 respectively passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, Narail in Title Appeal No.64 of 1987 dismissing the Appeal of the peti­tioner and affirming the judgment and decree passed by the learned Assistant Judge, Narail in Title Suit No. 383 of 1978.<br/> <br/>2. The facts, in short, are that the peti­tioner as a plaintiff filed Title Suit No.383 of 1978 in the Court of learned Assistant Judge, Narail for declaration of her title to the suit property contending, inter alia, that the said property originally belonged to Sukumar Bose and others. In a partition suit being Partition Suit No.132 of 1967 in the 3rd Court of Munsif, Narail the respondent opposite party No. 6 got the said property on the basis of a compromise decree passed in the said suit on 23-1-1968 and thereafter sold the present suit premise to the plaintiff-petitioner by a Saf-kabala deed dated 21-1-1974 and handed over peaceful vacant possession of the said properties to her and since then she is in possession of the same in exercising her exclusive right, title and interest in respect thereof, that while the plaintiff-peti­tioner had been enjoying the schedule property in the said manner one of her relations namely, Dr. Raj Kumar Kundu (now deceased) the predecessor of the defendant-opposite party Nos.2-5, requested the plaintiff-petitioner for temporary shelter to reside in the suit property, specially in the suit buildings consisting of five rooms including kitchen. Being thus requested the appellant-petitioner allowed the said Dr Raj Kumar Kundu, the predecessor of the respon­dent-opposite party Nos. 2-5, to make temporary use of the suit premises as their residence as licensees, that since then the said Raj Kumar Kundu including the respondent-opposite party Nos.2-5 are residing there as licensees holding permissive possession from the appellant-petitioner of the said suit premises. On 30-5-1978 one of the employees of the respondent-opposite party No.1 informed the husband of appellant-petitioner that the property in question had been placed in the vested property list and the same would be leased out. The further contention of the appel­lant-petitioner is that the schedule properties could not be a vested property under any circumstances as she had been enjoying and possessing the same by purchase and had mutated her name in the record of right and had been paying the rents to the Government regularly, that her vendor Probhabati Dasi, the respondent-opposite party No.6, is a Bangladeshi citizen and therefore the property in question is the legally acquired property of her own. The contention of respondent-oppo­site party No.1 regarding vested property is false and without lawful authority and, as such, the appellant-petitioner was constrained to file the suit.<br/> <br/>3. The case of the respondent-defendant No.1 is that the previous owner of the suit.<br/> <br/>4. The case of respondent-opposite party Nos.2-5 was that their father, Raj Kumar Kundu, was a physician who used to practice at Rupganj Bazar whereat he had a dispensary. The said Raj Kumar Kundu desired to purchase a property for his residential purpose. Sukumar Bose, the owner of the suit premises, offered to sell the same and the price having been fixed at Taka 3,000 (Taka three thousand) a sum of Taka 1,500 (one thousand five hundred) only had been paid to Sukumar Bose by the said Raj Kumar Kundu as earnest money in the year 1952 and the possession of the suit property was handed over to the vendee by the vendor and since then they are in possession of the suit property. On 7-4-1962 their father, Raj Kumar Kundu paid up the balance consideration money of Taka 1,500 (Taka one thousand five hundred) to Sukumar Bose and on the same date a written agreement was made between the parties. The said Sukumar Bose thereafter left for India for his treatment and died there. Thereafter the father of the respondent-opposite party Nos.2-5 died, that they could not know about the alleged decree in Title Suit No.132 of 1967. Sukumar Bose having not been residing at Machimdia in the year 1967 could not make any solenama as alleged by the plaintiff-appellant petitioner. The alleged solenama decree of said title suit is false, fab­ricated, concocted and obtained by practising fraud upon the Court. Probhabati had no right, title, interest and possession of the suit pro­perty and the alleged "Saf-Kabala" deed was forged, fictitious and without any considera­tion. The plaintiff-appellant petitioner did not possess the suit property at any point of time and respondent-opposite party Nos.2-5 did not have any permissive possession under plaintiff-appellant petitioner. The further contention of the respondent opposite party Nos.2-5 is that the respondent-opposite party No.1 having treated them as unauthorised occupiers in the suit premises and the property in question having been declared as vested pro­perty clouds have been cast upon the right, title and interest of their property in question hence, they have been constrained to file Title Suit No. 623 of 1979 in the Court of learned Assistant Judge, Narail for declaration of their title.<br/> <br/>5. The trial Court dismissed the Title Suit No. 383 of 1978 and decreed the Title Suit No. 623 of 1979 in favour of the present respondent and declared that the defendant Nos. 2-5 acquired ownership of the suit house by adverse possession and they are entitled to retain their possession of the same. On appeal the appellate Court affirmed the judgment and decree of the trial Court and dismissed the appeal and the High Court Division on revision affirmed the judgment of the courts below and discharged the Rule.<br/> <br/>6. Heard the learned Advocate and perused the petition and the impugned judg­ment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/> <br/>7. It appears that both the trial Court and the court of appeal concurrently held that the plaintiff could not produce the sole decree pas­sed in Partition Suit No.132 of 1967 and could not prove the basis of acquisition of title by Probhabati Debi and therefore did not acquire any title by the alleged purchase from Probha­bati Debi by Exhibit 1 and therefore, the High Court Division was right in affirming the judg­ment of the Courts below.<br/> <br/>We find no merit in these petitions which are accordingly, dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
