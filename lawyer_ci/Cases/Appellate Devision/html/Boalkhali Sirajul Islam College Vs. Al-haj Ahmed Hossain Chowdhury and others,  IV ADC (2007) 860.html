R. Mudassir Husain, CJ.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This is a review petition filed by the defendant in a suit for declaration of the plaintiff-respondent's 'rayoti' right to the suit land and for khash possession thereof.<br/> <br/>2. The plaintiffs case was that he was the donor member of the Boalkkhali; Sirajul Islam College and during his membership in the governing body of the said college, he made a gift in respect of .32 acres of land from R.S. Plot No. 7462 in favour of the said college. But the college authority trespassed into the suit land on 15-12-1986 and included the same into college boundary by putting bamboo fencing in spite of the objection by the plaintiff,  the college authority denied the plaintiffs title in the suit land, Hence, this suit was filed.<br/> <br/>3. The leave-petitioner as defendant No.1 contested the suit by filing written statement denying the claim of the respondent-plaintiff No. 1.<br/> <br/>4. Upon hearing the parties, the learned Assistant Judge dismissed the suit against which the plaintiff-respondent took an appeal and the appellate Court allowed the appeal and decreed the suit in part declaring plaintiffs title to the 2 “Ka” schedule land and also for recovery of his khash possession of the same directing the plaintiff to execute a deed of gift in respect of the land of schedule No.1 and also directing the defendant college to prepare a donors list inserting the name of the plaintiff therein. Against the judgment of the appellate Court, the petitioner herein as defendant No. 1 moved the High Court Division in revi­sion and the High Court Division by the impugned judgment set aside the afore­said appellate judgment and decree declaring title in both the schedules of the plaintiff and also allowing khash possession thereof. The petitioner filed civil petition for leave to appeal against the judgment of the High Court Division. Upon hearing the parties, this Division dismissed the leave-petition finding to the effect that the High Court Division in the exercise of revisional jurisdiction dismissed the suit on the ground of limitation whereas the appel­late Court as a final Court of fact came to the finding that the suit was not barred by limitation. Upon consideration of materials on record this Division upheld the decision of the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>5. Mr. A.S.M. Zillul Haque, the learned Senior Advocate in support of review petition, argued that the plaintiff-respon­dent promised to make a gift of 51 (.51) acres of land to the college authority and accordingly he made a verbal gift of the suit land on 03.04.1974 and delivered possession of the same to the college. But this fact could not be established by the defendant. On the contrary, the plain­tiff executed deed of gift in respect of .32 acres of land and assured that he will execute and register a deed of gift for the rest later on. But he did not keep his promise and as such the High Court Division has committed an error in decreeing the suit as a whole and declar­ing the title of the plaintiff to both the scheduled land and getting back his khash possession thereof by removing all obstruction there from and that this Division has affirmed the same and as such the aforesaid judgment of this Division is required to be reviewed.<br/> <br/>6. On the cloak of a review petition, the same matter cannot be reopened. It has been repeatedly observed by this Division that a review is never meant nor can be allowed to be utilized as another opportunity for rehearing a matter, which has already been closed by a final judgment.<br/> <br/>7.  In such view of the matter, we find that the petitioner could not make out the case of review.  Hence, we find no ground to review of our judgment.<br/><br/>Accordingly, this review petition is dis­missed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
