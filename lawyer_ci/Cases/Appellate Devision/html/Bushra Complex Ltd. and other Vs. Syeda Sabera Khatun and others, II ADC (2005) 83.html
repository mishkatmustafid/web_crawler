Respondent Nos. 1-7 as writ petitioners moved the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 588 of 2001 challenging the legality of the order contained in Memo No. AP-34/67/6907/1(4) dated 1.12.1997 issued by the respondent No. 10 herein the Assistant Commissioner of Settlement Ministry of Housing and Public Works Government of Bangladesh cancelling the lease deed of the case land to the predecessor of respondent Nos. 1-7 Abul Hashem Khan and the order contained in Memo No. Ap-34/67/6907/l(3) dated 1.12.1997 issued by respondent No. 1 making the allotment of the said plot to the appellant in C.A.No. 257 of 2001 Bazlur Rahman and deed of lease dated 10-3-98 between respondent gov­ernment and the present appellant Bazlur Rahman.<br/> <br/>3. In C.A. No. 256 of 2001Bushra Complex Ltd. is appellant and Bazlur Rahman is respondent No. 13. In C.A. No. 257 of 2001 Bazlur Rahman is appellant and Bushra Complex Ltd. is respondent No. 13. They have been referred to as appellants in this common judgment.<br/> <br/>4. The facts are that the disputed plot of land No. 3/1, Block-A, Lalmatia Housing Estate measuring .041/2 acre was allotted to respondent Nos. 1-7 predecessor Abul Hashem Khan on 20.3.67. The land of Abul Hashem Khan and others including that of appellant Bazlur Rahman were requisitioned in L.A. Case No. 12/60-61 and 32/60-61 for the purpose of developing Lalmatia Housing Estate. On 10.6.1963 appellant Bazlur Rahman made a prayer for allotment of some plot of land to him as it was an admitted condition of the requiring body that the affected persons would be rehabil­itated. During the pendency of his prayer for allotment of some land the said disputed plot comprising an area of .04½ acre of land was allotted to abul Hashem Khan, the predecessor of respondent Nos. 1-7 by way of rehabilitation. Abul Hashem Khan paid the entire considera­tion but possession of the disputed plot was not given to him as the land was in physical posses­sion of appellant Bazlur Rahman at the relevant time. The appellant Bazlur Rahman then filed Title Suit No. 169 of 1967 challenging allot­ment of the said plot in favour of Abul Hashem Khan and that suit was decreed on 12.9.68 by Munsif, 1st Court, Dhaka, Thereafter the Government filed Title Appeal No. 362 of 1968 of against the said judgment and decree which was allowed by judgment and decree dated 30.3.1974 passed by Subordinate Judge, 1st Court, Dhaka sending back on remand the title suit for fresh trial, When the suit was pending in the trial court, the Government assured the appellant Bazlur Rahman that his prayer for allotment of the disputed plot to him would be considered if he withdrew the suit and accord­ingly, Bazlur Rahman withdrew the suit, but the Government did not comply with its promise.<br/> <br/>5. Thereafter the appellant Bazlur Rahman, filed writ petition No. 322 of 1977 challenging the order dated 14.2.77 whereby Government intimated its inability to allot the plot in question to the appellant. The predecessor of respondent Nos. 1-7 Abul Hashem Khan was respondent No. 4 in that wit petition. The writ petition was disposed of with certain observation and affirmed by this Division, which led Abul Hashem Khan to institute Title Suit No. 120 of 1982 before the 1st Court of Munsif, Dhaka against the Government and Bazlur Rahman for mandatory injunction seeking direction to make delivery of possession of the suit plot which was allotted to appellant Bazlur Rahman upon cancellation of the allotment in his favour. The said suit was re-numbered as Title Suit No. 105 of 11989 which was dis­missed for default and Misc. Case No. 23 of 1998 for restoration of the suit is pending. The Government then cancelled the lease in favour of Abul Hashem Khan who challenged the can­cellation in Writ Petition No. 588 of 2000. Government of Bangladesh contested Writ Petition No. 588 of 2000. At the same time appellant Bazlur Rahman and his transferee Bushra Complex Ltd. respondent No. 7 in the writ petition and appellant in C.A. No. 256 of 2001 contested the said writ petition by filing separate affidavit-in-opposition. The appellant Bazlur Rahman specifically pleaded compro­mise with Government after remand of his Title Suit No. 169 of 1967 and produced Government's letter bearing No. 1424/Ukser and No. 1425/Ukser both dated 19.4.75 in proof of such compromise. The appellant Bushra Complex Ltd. as respondent No. 7 stated in its affidavit-in-opposition that the lease deed dated 20.3.67 was not acted upon as the lessor Government never gave possession to Abul Hashem Khan. It was further state that Abul Hashem Khan respondent No. 4 in Writ Petition No. 322 of 1977 had moved the Appellate Division against the Judgment which was affirmed by this Division in C.P. No. 69 of 1981 by judgment dated 12.3.81. Further Abul Hashem Khan having instituted Title Suit No. 120 of 1982 which was dismissed the present Writ Petition No. 588 of 2000 at the instance of his heirs (respondent Nos. 1-7) is not maintainable. Bushra Complex Ltd. being bonafide pur­chaser for value from Bazlur Rahman and there being no suit or pending appeal at the relevant time, it took possession of the suit plot and invested large amount money for development and improvement of the property. The respon­dent Nos. 1-7 were aware of such constructions which were carried on to their knowledge and in their very presence, for more than a year.<br/> <br/>6. Upon hearing the parties the High Court Division made the Rule absolute and gave direction as stated above.<br/> <br/>7. The High Court Division was of the view that as the entire lease money was paid long before by the predecessor of respondent Nos. 1-7 Abul Hashem Khan the termination of the lease without giving any notice was ipso facto illegal, as permanent right had been accrued in favour of the said respondents and there being no breach of the condition of lease, it could not be cancelled as it had been done in the instant case. It further held that appellant Bazlur Rahman had no right at all of the disputed land and the sale was made to defeat the right of these respondents who were fighting in the courts of law over the disputed land and as such, the purchase by appellant Bushra Complex Ltd. was barred by the principle of lis pendence and it had not acquired any legal right in the disputed land. The High Court Division also did not accept the submission that the doc­trine of frustration as defined in 56 of the Contract Act applied in the present case. It also held that the unilateral termination of the lease in favour of Abul Hashem Khan without giving any notice was a new cause of action for filling Writ Petition No. 588 of 200. The High Court Division therefore was of the view that the lease in favour of Abul Hashem Khan had been ille­gally cancelled and the Government committed illegality in not delivering possession of the lease property to the respondent Nos. 1-7. It also acted illegally and arbitrarily in allotting the same disputed plot to the appellant Bazlur Rahman and executing deed of lease in his favour without caring to the legal position as well as to the findings and decisions given by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 322 of 1977 and of this Division in Civil Petition No. 69 of 1981.<br/> <br/>8. Mr. Khondker Mahbubudin Ahmed, the learned counsel appearing for appellant Bazlur Rahman inter alia submitted that Title Suit No. 120 of 1982 (subsequently re-numbered as Title Suit No. 105 of 1989 in the 1st Court of Assistant Judge, Dhaka) for possession having been dismissed for default on 6.10.97 and Misc. Case No. 23 of 1998 for restoration of the suit being pending on 6.2.2000, Writ Petition No. 588 of 2000 was not maintainable, being barred under rule 9(1) of Order IX of the Code of Civil Procedure, writ being a civil proceeding vide 1970 PLD (SC) page 1. Writ Petition No. 322 of 1977 having been finally disposed of as to the rights of the two parties i.e. Bazlur Rahman and Abul Hashem Khan and such observation having been upheld by the Appellant Division, The cancellation of Abul Hashem Khan's allot­ment on 1.12.97 and his lease agreement on 10.3.98 when there was no legal bar in doing so as there was no case pending at the relevant time, could not be said of lease to have given rise to a new cause of action for moving the High Court Division in writ jurisdiction. It was further submitted that lease agreement dated 20.3.67 in favour of Abul Hashem Khan being incomplete and executory in nature, (possession having not been given to the leasee) its cancellation by lessor cannot and did not give rise to fresh cause of action. It was also submitted that no legal (Civil) proceeding being pending between on 6.10.97 on which date Title Suit No. 120 of 1982 subsequently re-numbered as Title Suit No. 105 of 1989 was dismissed for default and on 6.10.98 when Misc. Case No. 23 of 1998 under Order IX Rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure was filed for restoration which was also dismissed on 5.9.89, the High Court Division erred in holding that orders and action by Annexures D, D1 and D2 dated 1.12.97, 10.3.98 and 23.8.98 were barred by doctrine of lis pendence under section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act.<br/> <br/>9. It appears that the High Court Division held that the cancellation of the lease in favour of Abul Hashem Khan was illegal in that no notice was given for cancellation as stipulated in the lease. In the absence of such notice the cancellation was illegal as being against natural justice. The relevant portion of the lease agreement dated 20.3.67 between the Government and Abul Hashem Khan reads as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"In the event of the tenant committing breach of any of covenant of this indenture other than payment of rent, taxes, etc. and there being no specific provisions in respect of it in this covenant the lessor shall be at liberty without prejudice to any other rights that he may possess, after giving one calendar month's notice in writing to determine the lease under these pres­ents reenter into or upon the whole of the demised property or any part there­of and take possession thereof includ­ing the building, structure, etc. there on and thereupon shall wholly vest in and be the absolute property of the lessor but the tenant shall be entitled only to such compensation for the buildings structures etc. as may be determined by the by Superintending Engineer, Housing and Settlement Works (Housing and Planning) Department. The tenant however may remove any goods or things no being part of any building or structures on the demised property within a fortnight of such determination failing which they shall all be forfeited to Government and the tenant shall not be entitled to any price compensation or damage whatsoever therefore."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>10. In the instant case admittedly no posses­sion was delivered to Abul Hashem Khan. It has been submitted that this agreement was execu­tory and had not been fully acted upon by deliv­ery of possession. In that view of the matter the requirement to give one calendar month notice in writing to determine the lease under these presents and re-enter into or upon the whole of the demised property would only arise when possession has been handed over to the lessee i.e. Abul Hashem Khan. No possession having been given no vested right was created and the lessee Abul Hashem Khan could not legally claim one-month calendar notice under this pro­vision of the lease agreement. The High Court Division therefore erred in holding that one month's calendar notice was required to be served on the Abul Hashern Khan before deter­mining lease. On the question of the claim of appellant Bushra Complex Ltd. Being hit by doctrine of lis pendence under section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act it has been pointed out that on the date of transfer by appellant Bazlur Rahman to Bushra Complex Ltd. There was no civil suit pending with regard to the suit land. On the contrary it has been shown that on 14.5.85 Title Suit No. 120 of 1982 was dis­missed for default. Abul Hashem Khan than filed Misc. Case No. 99 of 1985 for restoration of the suit, which was allowed and suit was restored. The suit was re-numbered as Title Suit No. 105 of 1989 in the 1st Court of Assistant Judge, Dhaka. On 28.1.90 Title Suit No, 120 of 1982 i.e. Title Suit No. 105 of 1989 was again dismissed for default and Misc. Case No. 19 of 1990 for restoration of the suit was filed. On 28.10.90 the said Misc. Case No. 19 of 1990 was dismissed for default. On 31.10.90 Misc. Case No. 19 of 1990 and Title Suit No. 120 of 1982 i.e. Title Suit No. 105 of 1989 were restored on an application under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure. On 24.5.93 Title Suit No. 120 of 1982 i.e. Title Suit No. 105 of 1989 was again dismissed for default and again restored. On 6.10.97 the suit was again dismissed for default and no step was taken in respect of the same for full one year. On 1.12.97 Abul Hashem Khan's lease was cancelled and the disputed plot was leased to appellant Bazlur Rahman. On 10.3.98 lease deed was executed and registered in favour of appellant Bazlur Rahman. On 23.8.98 Bazlur Rahman trans­ferred the disputed plot to appellant Bushra Complex Ltd. and gave possession. On 23.8.90 Bazlur Rahman and Bushar Complex Ltd. Jointly started and continued construction of eight-storied building of disputed plot within 500 yards of Abdul Hashem Khan's business premises, without any objection or obstruction.<br/><br/>Then on 6.10.98 Misc. Case No. 23 of 1998 was filed for restoration of the suit, which was dis­missed on 5.9.1999. The suit was restored.<br/> <br/>11. It is clearly seen from above that Abul Hashem Khan did not at all pursue his case seriously for determination of his right with regard to the lease as observed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 322 of 1977 and affirmed by this Division in Civil Petition No. 69 of 1988. It is also seen that appellant Bazlur Rahman transferred the disputed land to appel­lant Bushra Complex Ltd. When there was no civil suit pending. Therefore the High Court Division committed an error in holding that the transfer took place during the pendency of suit and was hit by the doctrine of lis pendence. This Division having already decided on the respective parties rights arising out of the assurance given by the Government to allot the disputed land to appellant Bazlur Rahman and lease deed dated 20.3.67 in favour of Abul Hashem Khan predecessor of respon­dent Nos.1-7 the High Court Division acted illegally in deciding the question of the parties’ rights over the disputed land in Writ Petition No. 588 of 2000.<br/> <br/>12. In the right of our above discussion and observation the appeals are allowed without any order as to costs and the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 588 of 2000 is set aside.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
