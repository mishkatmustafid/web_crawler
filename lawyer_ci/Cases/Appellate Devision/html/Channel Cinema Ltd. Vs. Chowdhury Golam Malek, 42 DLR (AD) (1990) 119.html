Rahman J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This appeal by special leave, at the instance of the plaintiff-appellant M/s. Channel Cinema Ltd., a private limited company, has arisen out of a suit for eviction of the tenant on the grounds of default of payment of rent and the Company's bonafide requirement of the premises.<br/> <br/>2. The Company's case is that the tenant took lease of the suit premises for running a canteen in the passage of the plaintiffs Cinema Hall; that the tenant is a defaulter; that consistent complaints were made against the defendant for supplying low-quality food; and hence the plaintiff Company required the premises for running restaurant befitting its prestige and position.<br/> <br/>3. The defendant-respondent's case is that he was not a defaulter, that he invested a lot of money for furnishing and equipping his canteen with neces­sary fixtures; that he supplied good food to his customers; that he was not a defaulter; that the Manag­ing Director of the Company wanted to start the canteen-business himself; that when the landlord at­tempted lo evict him forcibly he instituted a title suit and obtained an order of injunction against the landlord; and that the suit for eviction was an after­thought and based on false and concocted allegation.<br/> <br/>4. The trial Court decreed the suit on the ground of bonafide requirement. The appellate Court upheld the decree on the ground of default, but did not consider the question of bonafide requirement. In revision the High Court Division reversed the find­ings of the Courts below and held that the defendant was not a defaulter and the plaintiff failed to prove its bonafide requirement of the premises in question.<br/> <br/>5. The appellant took a plea before the High Court Division that the landlord would get a decree on the ground of bonafide requirement if he could show any cause "which may be deemed satisfactory by the Court". The learned Single Judge of the High Court Division rejected that plea and observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"This, I am afraid, will not come under the connotation of bonafide requirements as contem­plated under section 18(I)(e) of the Ordinance. Further, on the face of the pleadings and the evi­dence adduced in the case the plaintiff totally failed to prove the bonafide requirement."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>6. Leave was granted to consider the merit of the plaintiff’s aforesaid plea of bonafide requirement.<br/> <br/>7. On behalf of the appellant it is contended that the issue as to bonafide requirement of the plain­tiff having been decided by the trial Court in his fa­vour upon consideration of the evidence on record, and the Court of appeal below, having noticed such finding, did not disapprove of the same, the finding on such issue was concurrent finding of fact and that the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division erred in law by interfering with such finding in revisional jurisdiction without any consideration of the evidence on record.<br/> <br/>8. The short answer to this submission is that the appellate Court did not at all consider the plain­tiffs case of bonafide requirement and hence the find­ing in this regard cannot be termed as a concurrent one.<br/> <br/>9. In the alternative, it is submitted that in the interest of justice the matter be remanded to the ap­pellate Court for its finding on the plaintiffs plea of bonafide requirement. In the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of opinion that the cause of jus­tice will be not furthered, rather it will be hampered if the matter is sent back to the appellate Court for re-consideration of the evidence of the parties.<br/> <br/>10. The plaintiff examined its accountant P.W. 1, Abdul Jalil, its two Supervisors P.W.2 Md. Badiruddin and P.W.3 Safiuddin, and its Managing Direc­tor P.W.4. The plaintiff did not examine any inde­pendent witness either a cine-goer or a customer of the canteen in support of its case that the food sup­plied by the canteen was not good. The trial Court arbitrarily shifted the onus on the defendant for prov­ing its defence plea that the food of the canteen was not bad and wrongly observed that the defendant failed to produce any consumer witness, when the case's onus probandi was not discharged by the plain­tiff itself.<br/> <br/>11. Apart from the landlord's requirement of the tenanted premises for building or rebuilding or for his own occupation or for the occupation of any person for whose benefit the premises are held what other cause or causes under clause (e) of the sub­section (1) of section 18 of the Premises Rent Con­trol Ordinance, 1963 will satisfy the Court as to the bonafide requirement of the landlord or as to the just cause for allowing a prayer for an eviction of the ten­ant will depend on the facts and circumstances of each particular case. We need not give the guidelines here. Suffice it to say that the plaintiff failed to bring its case home that the defendant tarnished the image of the cinema-hall, affected its goodwill and business-prospect by supplying bad food to its cus­tomers and the plaintiff needed the tenanted premises for the benefit of the company i.e. for the efficient management of the canteen by another person or by itself.<br/> <br/>The appeal is dismissed. No costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
