It is registered with the Board of Investment and permitted to manufacturechemicals like Hydrogen Peroxide, Caustic Soda, Chloride, Hydrochloric Acid,Sodium Hydro-Chloride, Stable Bleaching Powder, Chlorinated paraffin wax and toexport minimum 80% of its products. In the meantime the Government promulgatedS.R.O. No. 138/AIN/2007/2137/Shulka dated 27.06.2007 repealing S.R.O. No.114-AIN/2006/2106 Shulka dated 08.06.2006 giving indemnity bond facility inrespect of the industries exporting minimum 80% of its products for importationof capital machineries and accessories under the H.S. Codes mentioned in thesaid S.R.O. The respondent in order to set up machineries in its factorystarted importation of capital machineries and its accessories by openingletters of credit. Some of the imported consignments already arrived at theBenapole Customs Station and the Customs authority provisionally assessed thegoods on the basis of S.R.O. No. 138 dated 27.06.2007. The respondent releasedthe imported consignments after furnishing Indemnity Bonds under S.R.O. No. 138on 30.07.2007, 29.10.2007 and 08.10.2007 respectively. Against the letter ofcredit No. 23560601046 dated 21.06.2006 part shipment was allowed and remainingpart of the capital machineries namely salt handling and feeding system,primary brine purification and secondary brine purification system with allaccessories, 50 metric tons per day caustic soda plant along with requiredaccessories under H.S. Code No. 8479.82.00 arrived at the Benapole CustomsStation covered by Invoice No. 117 dated 28.10.2007 from India. The respondentsubmitted Bill of Entry No. C-36856 dated 29.11.2007 to assess and release theconsignment under indemnity bond facility provided in S.R.O. No. 138 dated27.06.2007. The customs authority started dilly-dallying in assessing the goodscovered under the submitted Bill of Entry. On query the respondent came to knowthat the customs authority is withholding the assessment and release pursuantto a memo communicated internally by the National Board of Revenue directingthe Customs Houses not to release the consignments under the Indemnity Bondfacility with the plea that there is no possibility of exporting Caustic Sodaabroad and as such in case of capital Machinery for Chemical Industries(Caustic Soda/Sodium Hydroxide) the Indemnity Bond facility will not beavailable. </span></p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New"'>The respondentas writ petitioner claimed that it is legally entitled to get benefit ofindemnity bond under S.R.O. No. 138 dated 27.06.2007 so long as the said S.R.O.remains in force; the relevant customs authority already assessed and releaseda portion of the capital machineries and accessories of the industry underindemnity bond facility; the respondent did not violate any conditions of theS.R.O. No. 138 dated 27.06.2007 and as such the benefit of the said S.R.O.cannot be withdrawn by an office order issued by Second Secretary, NationalBoard of Revenue. To set up infrastructures of the export oriented industry,the respondent spent huge foreign currency and local money and about 200 to 250employees are working in his factory. The respondent also procured bank loanfor running the business and in such circumstances withdrawal of indemnity bondfacility under S.R.O. 138 dated 27.06.2007 by an office order is nothing butexecutive high-handedness and an example of bureaucratic redtapism on the wayof industrial development of the country. The entrepreneurs took the initiativeand spent their hard earned money to set-up the industries with the assurance ofindemnity bond facility given under the S.R.O. No. 138 dated 27.06.2007 and assuch the petitioners cannot abruptly withdraw the facility in the midst ofimportation of the capital machineries by an office order. Moreover, no priornotice was served and the respondent was not heard before such withdrawal by anadministrative order. </p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New"'>In suchcircumstance the respondent as petitioner filed 7 separate Writ Petitions beingNo.<span style="color:fuchsia"> 10653of 2007, 1413 of 2008, 2286 of 2008, 1411 of 2008, 1412 of 2008, 1863 of 2008and 1862 of 2008</span> and obtained Rules.  </p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New";'>In due course after hearing both the parties by the impugned judgementand order the said Rules were made absolute. Hence the petitioners have filedthe instant civil petition for leave to appeal before this Division. </p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New";'>Mr. S. M. Moniruzzaman, learned Deputy Attorney General appearing onbehalf of the petitioners in all the cases submitted that the benefit ofindemnity bond in S.R.O. No. 138 dated 27.6.2007 accrued only in the case where80% of the total product of the manufacturers was exported and in the instantcase such facility was withdrawn by the National Board of Revenue under the impugnedletter dated 11.10.2007 since the export of <span style='Courier New"'>Caustic Soda from Bangladesh wasnot possible and because it was necessary to prevent evasion of duties. Hesubmitted that since there was no likelihood of the respondent company ofexporting 80% of its product of Caustic Soda, as found by the National Board ofRevenue, the authorities lawfully withdrew the indemnity bond facility by theimpugned letter dated 11.10.2007. </span></p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New"'>Mr. A.F.

No. 138 dated 27.6.2007 gave somefacilities to the petitioner in importing some capital machineries, but thosefacilities had been denied in pursuant of an office order of the Board ofRevenue which is not allowed by law. The High Court Division held that theoffice order cannot override the right provided to the exporters by the S.R.O.issued by the Government, and accordingly made all the Rules absolute. </p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New"'>We alsonote from the impugned letter dated 11.10.2007 that the indemnity bond facilitygiven by S.R.O. No. 138 was withdrawn by noting in the records by the Board ofRevenue on what appears to be a purely arbitrary surmise that there was nopossibility of exporting Caustic Soda from Bangladesh, and that it was donewithout serving any notice upon the industries importing capital machinery forthe production of Caustic Soda/Sodium Hydroxide. There was nothing on record tosubstantiate the conclusion that there was no possibility of exporting CausticSoda from Bangladesh.Moreover, a facility once given cannot be whimsically withdrawn without puttingthe potential beneficiaries on notice. This type of bureaucratic feat is to bedeprecated.   <span style="color:black;"></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none"><span style='Courier New";'>Inview of the above discussion, we do not find any illegality or infirmity in thejudgement of the High Court Division.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none"><span style='Courier New";'>Accordingly,the civil petition for leave to appeal is dismissed, without, however, anyorder as to costs.</span><span style='line-height:200%;Courier New";'> </span></p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span> </div></div>
