Ruhul Amin J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This petition for leave to appeal has been filed against the judgment dated July 8, 2003 of a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 4696 of 2001 making the Rule absolute obtained against the judgment and decree dated August 9, 2001 of the Court of Joint District Judge and 3rd Court of Artha Rin Adalat, Dhaka passed in Title Appeal No. 32 of 1998 reversing the judgment and decree dated October 19, 1997 of the 4th Court of Assistant Judge, Dhaka in Title Suit No.3 4 of 1997 decreeing the same declaring the notice issued by the defendant No. 1 illegal and not binding upon the plaintiffs.<br/> <br/>2. The suit was filed stating, inter alia, that the land in suit described in the 'Kha' schedule belonged to Bichanti Ferangi alias Binchent Gomes, the predecessor of the plaintiffs, that in the C.S. record the land was recorded in his name, that Denial Gomes was born out of wedlock of Bichanti Ferangi and his first wife, Anna Gomes, that Bichanti Ferangi married one Rajkumari Gomes, that Bichanti Ferangi's 2nd wife died leaving him the only heir, that Bichanti Ferangi married one Niroda Gomes, that Bichanti Ferangi appointed Harendra Chandra Pal as his attorney to look after his property but the record of right was wrongly prepared in the name of Harendra's nears and dears i.e. in the name of his brother and brother's wife, that Bichanti Ferangi died leaving two sons (one son by first wife and another by third wife) and two daughters (by third wife), that Asha Rani one of the daughters of Bichanti Ferangi died leaving the plaintiffs as her sons and as owners and possessors of the land in suit, that the plaintiffs are possessing the same through the tenants, that the plaintiffs appointed Md. Lutful Hoq, Talukder Sorrower Hossain, Md. Abu Taher and Md. Mukhleshur Rahman as their attorney to look after and manage the land in suit, that plaintiffs have 10 shops in the land in suit and used to possess the same through their tenants, that the defendant No.1 issued notice described in schedule 'Ka' to the plaint under Ordinance No.24 of 1970 for eviction of the plaintiffs. It is the contention of the plaintiffs that the notice so issued being illegal they are constrained to file the suit challenging the legality of the said notice.<br/> <br/>3. The suit was contested by the defendant Nos.1 and 2 by  filing  written  statement denying the case of the plaintiffs and stating, inter alia, that the land in suit was acquired in L.A. Case No.15/59-60 and L.A. Case No.16/59-60 for construction of Rail line and for earth cutting and possession of the land was taken over by the Railway on 19.12.1959 and 18.1.1960 and since then Railway is possessing the land in suit, that after construction of the Rail line the rest of the land was used for siding as well as earth cutting zone, that after construction of Panthapath there remained .47 acre vacant land and the plaintiffs are illegally possessing the same and as such notice was issued to  them  for vacating the land  in favour of the defendants and the plaintiffs have filed the suit only to grab the land of the Railway.<br/> <br/>4. The suit was decreed by the Court of Assistant Judge on the finding that the notice was not issued by the competent authority and that there is no description of the land in the schedule of the notice. As against the judgment and decree of the trial Court the contesting defendants went on appeal.<br/> <br/>5. The appellate Court set aside the judgment and decree of the trial Court on the findings that from the materials brought on record by the defendants it is seen that in respect of the land in suit award was made and the award money was paid and possession of acquired land of Plot No. 107 was taken over and thereupon acquired land was handed over to the Railway and the Railway has constructed Rail line and part of the unused land is in the possession of the Railway, that plaintiffs did not mention the name of the tenants in the plaint and that did not produce tenancy  agreement and  the plaintiffs did not seek the relief of declaration of title and in support of the claim of title in the land in suit did not place any paper before the Court, that plaintiffs have no title in the land in suit.<br/> <br/>6. The plaintiffs then moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained the Rule. It was contended from the side of the plaintiffs before the High Court Division that the notice served by the defendants is vague and the same does not contain any schedule nor there is mention of plot number and that Gazette Notification produced in support of claim of acquisition of the land does not show acquisition of the entire land of the plot, rather in the notice of acquisition it has been mentioned part of the land was acquired. It was also contended that the defendants were not authorized to issue the notice, that plaintiffs being in possession Mohanager Khatian has been prepared in their names and that a Title Suit being numbered 65 of 1998 seeking declaration of title is pending. As against the aforesaid contention of the plaintiffs it was submitted by the learned Counsel for the opposite parties that although in the notice for acquisition part of the plot was mentioned but in fact the whole property was acquired and award was prepared and the money was taken away by the awardees, that the suit filed seeking declaration of title being subsequent to the suit challenging notification is in no way can be taken into consideration in deciding the merit of the suit filed challenging the notice for evicting the plaintiffs. The High Court Division on consideration of the materials on record arrived at the finding that the Gazette Notification for the acquisition of the property in question does not show that the entire property of the plot was acquired and that the notice served for the eviction of the plaintiffs does not contain any specification of the land and the plot number. The High Court Division also observed entire land of the plot was not acquired and the notice does not contain "the specification of the property nor any dag number or plot number" and no authority to serve a notice was brought on record and the material that has been produced by submitting supplementary affidavit also does not show that the person who signed a notice was authorized to serve the notice. On the aforesaid finding the High Court Division made the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>7. The learned Counsel for the petitioner submits that the High Court Division was in error in holding that the person who served the notice was not authorized to serve the same since Gazette Notification was produced by filing supplementary affidavit showing that the officer who signed the eviction notice was authorized to exercise the power of a Magistrate as per the provision of Ordinance No. 24 of 1970. The crux of the matter is whether the property in its entirety was acquired or not and the property as to which notice in question was issued specific and certain or in other words not vague. The material produced before the Court showed that part of the land of the plot was acquired. It was contended on behalf of the defendants that in fact entire land of the plot was acquired though in the notice served for acquisition of the property part was written. The contention so made is not well founded in the background of the notice reflecting the fact that half of the land of the plot was acquired. The contention of the learned Counsel that in fact entire property was acquired and award for payment of compensation was prepared in respect of entire land of the plot and the money was paid can not be legally accepted. On the top of that the notice, served for eviction of the plaintiffs also lacks particular of property from which the authority intends to evict the plaintiffs.<br/> <br/>8. In that state of the matter we are of the view the High Court Division was not in error in setting aside the judgment of the appellate Court and thereby restoring the judgment of the trial Court.<br/> <br/>Accordingly the petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
