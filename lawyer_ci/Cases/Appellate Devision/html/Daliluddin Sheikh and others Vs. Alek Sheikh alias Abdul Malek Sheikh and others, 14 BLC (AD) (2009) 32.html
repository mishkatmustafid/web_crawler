The contention so made is of no substance since the defendants have claimed the land of the said two schedules, i.e. ‘Kha’ and ‘Ga’ schedules on the basis of alleged auction purchase, it was their obligation under the law to establish that they purchased the land in auction upon due compliance of the provisions of law. …… (21)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908)</strong><br/><strong>Order XXI, Rule 90</strong><br/><strong>It is seen from the materials on record that the defendants failed to establish their case of auction purchase upon due compliance of law and, in this regard, it has been held by the lower appellate Court that the auction by which defendants are said to have purchased the land depriving co-sharers was product of fraud.

It was not established that the defendant No.2 had any independent source of income or she had money from known source and by that money the land put to auction was purchased by her or the defendant No. 2, wife of defendant No.1 made auction purchase by the money earned by her. …..

The suit was filed seeking declaration of title, confirmation of possession and for partition of the land described in the schedule attached to the plaint.<br/> <br/>4. It was the case of the plaintiff that the 'Ka' and 'Kha' schedule land belonged to Faizuddin, father of the plaintiff Nos.1 and 2 and the defendant No.1, that the 'Ka' schedule land belonged to Faizuddin and that 'Kha' schedule land was owned by the plaintiffs and the defendant No.1 in equal share, that Faizuddin had two wives, that plaintiffs are the sons of the second wife and the defendant No. 1 is the son of the first wife, that Faizuddin died leaving second wife, plaintiffs and another son Dulal Sheikh, a daughter Kuti Bibi and the son the defendant No.1, that on the death of second wife of Faizuddin plaintiffs and another son Dulal and daughter Kuti Bibi inherited the properties left by her, that Kuti Bibi's share was inherited by her three brothers, that on the death of Dulal his share was inherited by his two brothers, that in the aforesaid manner the plaintiffs and the defendant No.1 became the co-sharers in respect of 'Ka' schedule land, that the defendant No.1 was entrusted to look after the land and to take steps for preparation of records of right and that he assured the plaintiffs that the records of right have been prepared correctly and that records of right have been prepared in the name of the plain­tiffs, that the defendant No. 2, since deceased, was the wife of the defendant No. 1 and that defendant No.1 got share in the land of 'Ka' and 'Kha' schedule to the extent of 3 annas 2 gondas and 2 kranti, but the defendant No.1 on different occasions illegally got the land of 'Kha' schedule auction sold and purchased the land of said schedule in the name of his wife, that the defendant Nos.1 and 2 had no right, title and interest in the land of 'Kha' schedule, that the land of 'Ga' schedule belonged to Wazed and he settled the said land to Mazid by the patta dated February 18, 1922, that on the death of Mazid his heirs Zobeda and others by a kabala dated July 20, 1946 sold the patta land to Gani and others, that on July 25, 1946 the land of the patta dated February 18, 1922 was purchased in the name of the plaintiffs and the defendant No.1 and thereafter the said land was taken settlement by the patta dated October 26, 1948 in the name of the plaintiffs and the defendant No.1 but the defendant No.1 illegally got the record of right in respect of 'Ga' schedule prepared in his name, that no plot of the 'Ga' schedule land was exchanged with Moksed but the record of right of the land got by exchange by plaintiffs was wrongly pre­pared in the name of Moksed, that the heirs of Moksed registered a deed of disclaimer on February 6, 1976 in favour of the plaintiffs and defendant No. 1 as regard the land of Plot No. 654 and in the aforesaid manner the plaintiffs and defendant No. 1 became sharers of the land of the said plot, that on Paush 15, 1384 BS the plaintiffs came to know from the local Revenue Office, that the defendant in respect of the land of each Jote has got his share recorded in excess, that the plaintiffs requested the defendant to give them their due share in respect of the land of the Jote but the defendant declined to partition the land of the Jote as per due shares of the parties, that the defendant No.1 has transferred land to others in excess of his share.<br/> <br/>5. The suit was contested by the defend­ant Nos. 1 and 2 denying the averments made in the plaint and contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the 'Ka' schedule land belonged to Wazed and Faizuddin and they mortgaged the 'Ka' schedttle land to Karim, that Karim filed Money Suit No.7 of 1950 during the lifetime of Wazed and Faizuddin since money borrowed was not paid by them and obtained decree, that the defendant No. 2 Sharupjan purchased the mortgaged land on June 22, 1950 when the same was sold in execution of the decree obtained in Money Suit No.7 of 1950 and the said defendant No. 2 possessed the land through her husband defendant No. 1, that the plaintiffs have no right, title and interest in the land of 'Ka' schedule, that there was a rent suit in respect of 'Ka' schedule land being No. 790/35 in respect of the land of Plot No. 240 and the land of said plot was purchased in auction by Abdul Gafur on August 8,1938 and got possession in 1939, that Gafur's daughters settled the said land by a patta dated December 1, 1945 to Wazed Sheikh, that Wazed Sheikh died leaving a son, a daughter and a wife, that during the life of Gafur as rent of the land of Plot No. 240 had fallen in arrear the daughters of Gafur filed rent Suit No.790 of 1935 against Amjad Sheikh and got a decree and Amjad Sheik purchased the land in auction held in 1938 that Amjad Sheikh sold the said land to the defendant No.1 by Kabala dated July 25, 1946, that the defendant No.1 purchased the said land by his own earned money and thus the defendant No.1 became the owner of 92 decimals of land of Plot Nos. 236, 237-240, that 24 decimals of land of Plot No.1448 being possessed by the defendant as being the inherited land from his father and the said land has correctly been recorded in his name, that Indra Mahbub Chakroborti settled the land of Plot Nos.1486 and 760 to the extent of 57 decimals of land to the defendant No. 2 by the kabuliat of the year of 1363 BS, that the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 are the heirs of Fuljan, that as the defendant No.1 was sick and taking advantage thereof the plaintiff No.1 got the RS prepared showing share to the extent of 2/3 in the name of the plaintiffs, that land of 'Kha' schedule belonged to Pramath Nath Chakraborri and others and the possession was with Faizuddin and Wazed since Faizuddin owed to Karim and, as such, Money Suit No. 4546 was filed against the heirs of Faiz and land measuring 96 decimals were purchased by the defendant No. 2, that the plaintiffs have no share in 'Kha' schedule land, that <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>  land of Plot No. 811 is owned by the defendant No.1 inherited from his father and the same is possessed amicably, that the record of right in respect of the land in suit were prepared correctly, that plaintiffs have no right, title and interest of the land in suit.<br/> <br/>6. The suit was also contested by the defendant No. 21 claiming<sup> 2</sup>/<sub>3</sub>  share in the land of 'Ka' schedule land, contending previously land of 'Ka' schedule owned by Gongacharan and he gave the land in borga cultivation to Rashed Mollah, that at the time of preparation of CS record Gongacharan took back the land from Rashed and others and settled the land with the father of the defendant in the year 1360 BS and since then defendant is in posses­sion, that SA record has been prepared in the name of defendant's father Moksed, but the record of right in respect of land of Plot No. 665 has been prepared wrongly in the name of plaintiffs and defendant No.1, that on the death  of Moksed defendant Nos. 21-26 inherited the land of Moksed.<br/> <br/>7. The trial Court on consideration of the materials on record dismissed the suit upon observing: <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">‘‘প্রকৃতপক্ষে, বাদীগনের স্বতব যোগ সূত্র এবং উৎস ১৯২২ ( প্রকাশ  ১৯২৮) সনের পাট্টা দলিল। বাদীপক্ষে প্রথমে বিরেীয় জমিটি চিহি্ঞত করার জন্য দলিল ভাওড়ানো সমীচিন ছিল। কিন্তু তা না করায় , বর্তমান মামলার জমি ও ১৯২৮ সন বা ১৯২২ সনের দলিলের জমি এক ও অভিন্য কিনা তা নির্ধারন করা দুরহ ব্যাপার। এরুপ অস্পষ্টতার কারনে বাদী পক্ষ কোন প্রতিকার পাইতে পারেনা।’’</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>8. As against the judgment and decree of the trial Court the plaintiffs went on appeal. The appellate Court formulated the points as follows whether the suit is maintainable, whether the plaintiffs have title and possession in the land in suit described in the schedule attached to the plaint and are entitled to a decree and whether the judgment and decree of the trial Court is sustainable in the eye of law.<br/> <br/>9.The Appellate Court took up the second point for consideration first and upon consideration of the materials brought on record by the parties as well as upon consi­dering the evidence, both oral and  documen­tary, arrived at the finding "So thus as per admission of defendants and the evidence on record the plaintiffs are entitled to have 5.16 acres share in 'Ka' schedule land" and as regard the 'Kha schedule land the Appellate Court observed it was the duty of the defendants to prove their auction purchase  and  on consideration of the evidence, both oral and documentary held, "The defendants totally failed to prove their alleged auction purchase of suit property. The defendant No. 2 also failed to prove her source of income, Minimum evidence as to source of income was led by defendants. Even the defendants did not state any thing in W/S as well as in examination in chief in this regard."<br/> <br/>10. The Appellate Court further observed that: "Admittedly the plaintiffs were minors at the time of alleged auction purchase and both plaintiffs and defendants were in joint mess. The defendant No. 1 being elder brother used to take care of the minor plaintiffs and maintain the family with the income of properties left by their father Faizuddin. So even if the properties of Faizuddin would be sold in auction why it was purchased in the name of the wife of defendant No.1. Actually, the defendant No. 1 collusively created all the documents of alleged auction Exhibits ABC to grab the valuable suit property. The documents were created with an ulterior motive to deprive the plaintiffs from their respective share in suit property.<br/> <br/>11. The appellate Court also observed that auction purchase so made by the defendants, the purchase of ejmali property put to auction sale for arrears of rent by the co-sharers in benami such purchase inures to the benefit of other co-sharers and, as such, by the auction purchase defendants did not acquire exclusive ownership to the land so purchased. The co-sharers i.e. plaintiffs cannot be deprived of their due share by the so called auction sale since the auction purchaser was one of the co-sharers closely related person i.e. wife of defendant No.1. The appellate Court observed that without impleading all the heirs of Faizuddin the money suit was filed and accordingly, all the heirs of Faizuddin were not made party in the auction proceeding and the auction was held at a time when plaintiffs were minor and they were not properly represented.<br/> <br/>12. It was held by the appellate Court "thus it can be safely said that the defendant No.1 created all the documents of bainama and sale certificate Exhibit A,B,C by fraud practice," the appellate Court also held that defendant No. 2 failed to prove purchase of 41 decimals of land of Plot No.1486 and Plot No. 760, that the kabuliat was not filed in support of the aforesaid land in suit at the time of trial and that after remand to the trial Court kabuliat was filed but same was void document since on December 13, 1955 settling of the land was prohibited, that it was held by the Appellate Court that the defendant No.1 failed to produce any document in support of the land of Plot No. 810, not stated in examination in chief about purchase of said land, finally it was also held by the Appellate Court that plaintiffs as heirs of Faizuddin are entitled to get their separate saham of 6.83 acres of land of 'Kha' schedule land, the appellate Court on consi­deration of the materials on record held that the identity of land of Plot No. 240 has been established and that on consideration of the materials on record held that the plaintiffs are entitled to get 5.16 acres of land of 'Ka' schedule, the appellate Court on discussions of evidence, both oral and documentary, arrived at the finding "the plaintiffs have succeeded to prove their case and as such they are entitled to get the decree as prayed" and thereupon decreed the suit upon setting aside the judgment of the trial Court.<br/> <br/>13. As against the judgment and decree of the appellate Court defendant No. 1 and the heirs of the defendant No. 2 as well as defendant No. 21 moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained Rule.<br/> <br/>14. The petitioners of the revisional appli­cation contending before  the High Court Division that the lower appellate Court on erroneous assessment of facts and erroneous view of the law set aside the judgment and decree  of the  trial  Court and  thereupon allowing the appeal decreed the suit, that the lower appellate Court without reversing the findings and decisions of the trial Court and without assigning reason cogent in support of his decisions reversed the judgment and decree of the trial Court, that the share or in other words shaham given to the plaintiffs was the result of erroneous view of the materials on record, that the finding of the lower appellate Court as to the documents relating to auction sale, particularly sale certificate and other related papers i.e. Exhibits A, B, C not genuine is not based on due consideration of the materials on record rather the said finding as regard papers relating to auction was mere surmise and conjecture, that the finding of the lower appellate Court as to the property of plaintiff put to the auction and purchased in the name of the defendant No.1's wife and another relation were purchased with the income of the properties left by the plaintiffs and the defendant No. 1's predecessor is not correct rather the same was the result of erroneous view of the law and materials on record, that the lower appellate Court committed error as regard the finding of identity of the land of Plot No. 240 without directing the parties to take steps for identification of the land by local investigation.<br/> <br/>15. On behalf of the plaintiff-opposite parties it was contended before the High Court Division that the land as to which declaration of title, confirmation of possession and partition was sought described meeting the requirement of law and was identifiable, that the parties, i.e. the contesting defendants having had admitted the identity of the land of Plot No. 240, that was taken settlement by the patta and that having had explanation why the land of Plot No. 240 was described by boundaries, as such there was no requirement of ascertaining identity of the land by local investigation, that the evidence led by the parties established the fact that the land of patta dated February 18,1922 Exhibit 1 is the land of Plot No. 240 and, as such, contention that the appellate Court was in error in not making direction to the parties to take steps for identi­fication of land of Plot No. 240 by local investigation was of no merit, that although defendants claimed the land of 'Kha' schedule said to have purchased in an auction but having had not placed any document in support of auction purchase the appellate Court was correct decreeing the saham prayed by the plaintiffs in respect of the land of 'Kha' schedule.<br/> <br/>16. The High Court Division on consi­deration of the materials on record arrived at the finding that the trial Court without considering both oral and documentary, evidence on record dismissed the suit by a slip shod judgment and that the appellate Court on detail discussions of the evidence, both oral and documentary, arrived at the finding that the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief sought in the suit and thereupon decreed the suit upon reversing the judgment and decree of the trial Court. The High Court Division on scrutiny of the materials on record arrived at the finding that the last Court of fact upon due consi­deration of the evidence, both oral and docu­mentary, had correctly arrived at the finding that the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief sought and that the defendants failed to establish their case of auction purchase of the land of 'Kha' and 'Ga' schedule. The High Court Division also held that the defendants' contentions that the land of Plot No. 240 is not the land of the patta dated February 18, 1922 is not tenable since the parties i.e. plaintiffs and defendants, have admitted the fact the land described in the patta of February 18, 1922 by boundaries is the land subsequently recorded in Plot No. 240. The High Court Division was of the view since the finding of fact arrived at by the lower appellate Court is based on consi­deration of the evidence, both oral and documentary, and that the finding arrived at by lower appellate Court being not product of misreading or non consideration of the evidence it is beyond the jurisdiction of the High Court Division as revisional Court to disturb the findings of fact arrived at by the last Court of fact i.e. the appellate Court below in the instant case.<br/> <br/>17. On the aforesaid findings and decisions the High Court Division discharged the Rule.<br/> <br/>18. As against the judgment and order of the High Court Division the heirs of the defendant No. 1 as well as the heirs of the defendant No. 2 filed the present petition for leave to appeal.<br/> <br/>19. It may be mentioned that the defen­dant Nos.1 and 2 were the husband and wife respectively. The instant petition for leave to appeal is by their heirs. The other defendant No. 21 who contested the suit has accepted the judgment and order of   the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>20. The plaintiffs filed the suit seeking separate shaham for 5.16 acres of land from the land of 'Ka' schedule attached to the plaint and that they also prayed for shaham to the extent of 6.83 and 15 2/3 acres of land from the land of 'Kha' ad 'Ga' schedule attached to the plaint. The plaintiffs further prayed for declaration of title, confirmation of possession and partition of the land of 'Kha' and 'Ga' schedule along with the prayer for partition of the land of 'Ka' schedule.<br/> <br/>21. The learned Advocate-on-Record sub­mitted that the High Court Division as well as the Court of appeal below were in error in holding that the defendants were to prove their case of auction purchase of the land of 'Kha' and 'Ga' schedule and thus was in error in placing the onus on the defendants instead of the plaintiffs. The contention so made is of no substance since the defendants have claimed the land of the said two schedules, i.e. 'Kha' and 'Ga' schedules on the basis of alleged auction purchase, it was their obligation under the law to establish that they purchased the land in auction upon due compliance of the provisions of law.<br/> <br/>22. It is seen from the materials on record that the defendants failed to establish their case of auction purchase upon due compliance of law and, in this regard, it has been held by the lower appellate Court that the auction by which defendants are said to have purchased the land depriving co-sharers was product of fraud. The finding so arrived at by last Court of fact is based on scrutiny of the materials brought on record by the parties and upon due consideration of the evidence led by the parties. It is seen from the judgment of the lower appellate Court that the minors were not represented in the money suit, in execution decree whereof the land of the plaintiffs were put to auction, although plaintiffs' mother was alive at the relevant time but she was not made party in the money suit to represent the minors i.e. the plaintiffs.<br/> <br/>23. It is seen from the materials on record that in support of taking settlement of the land from the auction purchaser the defendants produced a document of the year 1957, which was of a time when settlement was prohibited long before i.e. in 1955, by the private person and the said fact demonstrates that defendants were ought to grab the share of the plaintiffs by resorting to the acts whether fair or foul or that legal or illegal and in furtherance thereof they placed before the Court the document which was totally illegal since fact tried to establish by the said document was contravention of law and, as such, was an illegal act.<br/> <br/>24.  The learned Advocate-on-Record sub­mitted that the appellate Court was in error in holding that the land of patta dated February 18, 1922 corresponds to the land of Plot No.240. The contention is of no merit as it is seen from the materials on record, and particularly from the judgment of the appellate Court, which court on detailed discussions of the evidence arrived at finding that the parties to the suit admitted that the land of patta dated February 18, 1922 is the land of Plot No.240. It may be mentioned the land of patta dated February 18, 1922 was described by boundaries and the explanation as to that was that at the relevant time the land was not divided into plots and this fact is not disputed by the parties to the suit.<br/> <br/>25. It was the contention of the learned Advocate-on-Record for the petitioners that the lower appellate Court was in error in not making direction to the parties to get the land of Plot No.240 identified by the local investi­gation and that the High Court Division also was in error in concurring with the finding of the lower appellate Court as to the identity of the land of Plot No. 240. the submission so made is of substance since the evidence on record clearly shows, particularly from the evidence of DWs that the defendants admitted land of Plot No. 240 is of the land of patta dated February 18, 1922. The plaintiffs led sufficient evidence as to the fact that the land of patta dated February 18, 1922 has subsequently been listed in Plot No. 240. The finding of the lower appellate Court as to the identify of the land of Plot No. 240 is based on due consideration of the evidence on record and said finding and decision being not the product of misreading or non consideration of the evidence on record the High Court Division was not in error in not disturbing the finding arrived at by the lower appellate Court as to the identity of the land of Plot No.240.<br/> <br/>26. The learned Advocate-on-Record sub­mitted that the High Court Division was in error in concurring with the finding of the lower appellate Court as to presumption of jointness of the family in Muslim Law. It is seen from the judgment of the lower appellate Court that the said Court on consideration of the evidence on record held that on the death of the father of the plaintiffs and the defendant No.1, the defendant No.1 being elder brother of the minor plaintiffs were looking after the members of the family of Faizuddin Sheikh i.e. father of the plaintiffs and the defendant No.1, and it is also seen from the materials on record that while the defendant No.1 was actually managing the property left by the father of plaintiffs and the defendant No.1, some of the properties left by the father of the plaintiffs and defendant No.1 were put to auction and the same were purchased in the name of the wife of the defendant No.1. It has already been men­tioned the auction was held without taking any step for representing the minors and also without impleading the co-sharers and in that background of the matter the appellate Court held that the auction was not genuine, rather the defendant No. 1 purchased the property in the name of his wife to deprive the co-sharers.<br/> <br/>27. In that view of the matter we are of the view that the High Court Division was not in error in not. interfering with the finding of the lower appellate Court as to nature and character of the auction sale and the purchase made in the name of the wife of the defendant No.1 This fact clearly demonstrates that the auction was not genuine, rather it was intended to deprive the minors, that is, the plaintiffs Nos. 1 and 2. It is seen from the judgment of the lower appellate Court that no attempt was made by the defendants to show that the defen­dant No. 2 i.e. wife of the defendant No.1, had independent source of income and that she purchased the land put to auction owned by the plaintiff Nos. 1 and 2, who were the co-sharers, with her own money. Since it has been established that on the death of father of the plaintiff Nos.1 and 2 as well as defendant No.1 i.e. the sons of Faiz Uddin Sheikh, the defendant No.1 was looking after the property left by the father of the plaintiffs and the defendant No.1 and in that background it was observed by the lower appellate Court that after the death of Faizuddin Sheikh i.e. father of the plaintiff Nos.1 and 2 and the defendant No.1 they were not in separate mess rather in one mess and the income of the property left by Faizuddin Sheikh was in the common fund of the plaintiffs and the defendant No.1. In the background of discussions made hereinbefore we are of the view there is no reason to take exception to the observation of the lower appellate Court as to jointness of the Muslim family since the said observation is supported by the fact brought on record by the parties, particularly the plaintiffs.<br/> <br/>28. It may be mentioned there may not be presumption of jointness of family in the Muslim Law, but the fact has been established that after the death of Faizuddin Sheikh, father of the plaintiffs and defendant No.1, the members of Faizuddin's family were in one mess and the income of the property left by Faizuddin was in the common fund of the plaintiffs and the defendant No.1 and in the background of the said fact the lower appellate Court observed that by the money of the joint fund of the plaintiffs and the defendant No.1 the auction purchase was made. It was not established that the defendant No.2 had any independent source of income or she had money from known source and by that money the land put to auction was purchased by her or the defendant No.2, wife of defendant No.1 made auction purchase by the money earned by her.<br/> <br/>29.  In the background of the discussions made hereinbefore we find no substance in the petition for leave to appeal.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>
