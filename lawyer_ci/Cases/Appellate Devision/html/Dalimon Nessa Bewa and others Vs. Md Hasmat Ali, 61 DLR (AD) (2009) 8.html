Shahidul Huq, Advocate-on-Record-For the Respondent.<br/> <br/><strong>Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 751 of 2005. </strong><br/>(From the judgment and order dated 14th March, 2005 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 2467 of 2002).<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong><u>Mohammad Fazlul Karim J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This application under Article 103 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh is directed against the judgment and order dated 14.03.2005 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 2467 of 2002 making the Rule absolute and set aside the judgment and decree dated 20.04.2002 passed by the Additional District Judge, 2nd Court, Tangail in Title Appeal No.124 of 1998 reversing those dated 10.05.1998 passed by the Sub-Judge, 2nd Court, Tangail, in Partition Suit No.124 of 1987.<br/> <br/>2. Plaintiff instituted partition suit No.124 of 1987 in the Court of Subordinate Judge, 2nd Court, Tangail praying for a preliminary decree for partition to 3.60 acres of land appertaining to C.S. Khatian No.50 of Mouza Chakra under Police Station-Madhupur, District-Tangail stating, <em>inter alia,</em> that the said land belonged to Madary Sheikh who transferred the entire land by an oral gift in favour of Sonajan. Madary Sheikh has no male issue. Sonajan was married to Jinnat Sheikh and the later was taken as domesticated son-in-law. During C.S. operation the suit land was recorded in the name of Madary Sheikh but in the possessor's column the name of Jinnat Sheikh was wrongly recorded, Sonajan died leaving behind her husband Jinnat Sheikh and one son Ahmed Sheikh. Jinnat Sheikh transferred 1.05 acres of land in favour of the defendant Nos.7 and 8. Jinnat Sheikh took second wife. Thereafter, Jinnat Sheikh died leaving behind his second wife, three sons named Ahmed Sheikh, Kasim Sheikh and Jasimuddin and three daughters named Kamala, Rahima and Jarina. Thereafter, Ahmed Sheikh died leaving behind the plaintiff No.3 to be his wife and the plaintiff Nos.1 and 2 to be his sons and one daughter named Ambia. Ambia sold her share in favour of the defendant No.4. This is why the plaintiff inherited 3.06 acres of land and claimed partition but the same was refused and as such the suit.<br/> <br/>3. The defendant Nos.1-5 contested the suit by filing a joint written statement contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit land belonged to Madary Sheikh who transferred the entire land by an oral gift in favour of Jinnat Sheikh and handed over possession. During C.S. operation that suit lands were correctly recorded in the name of Jinnat Sheikh being possessor. S.A. record was also prepared in the name of Jinnat Sheikh. Jinnat Sheikh died leaving behind 3 sons named Ahmed Sheikh, Kasim Sheikh and Jasimuddin and three daughters named Kamala, Rahima and Jarina. Thereafter Jasimuddin died leaving behind defendant No. 1 to 5 to be his heirs.<br/> <br/>4.  Mr. Md. Aftab Hossain, Advocate on-Record, appearing for the petitioners submits that the High Court Division has not applied his judicial mind that the Trial Court decreed partition suit in par and the lower appellate Court being the final Court also decreed the suit in part it respect of 3.60 acre of the disputed land in favour of the plaintiff-appellants but the High Court Division was pleased to go beyond the pleading of parties and misreading, misinterpreting and misapplying the Exhibit Ka (1) and Exhibit Ka(2) and even without touching the evidence of a single P.Ws. and D.Ws. regarding adverse possession made the Rule absolute to the serious prejudice of the petitioner occasioning a total failure of justice; that in view of the pleadings of parties; nature and character of the present partition suit, evidence both oral and documentary and findings of Courts below including the lower appellate Court, the High Court Division without application of judicial mind to the Exhibits Ka(1) and Ka(2) that exhibits has no nexus to the facts and circumstances of the case and without discussion and analysis and giving any reason whatsoever relying on the principle enunciated in the case of <strong><em>Malik Din Vs. Mohammad Aslam</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>21 DLR (SC) 94 </em></strong>(Judgment, inter parties). <strong><em>8 BLD (AD) 14</em></strong> (<em>Res judicata</em>) has abruptly reached to the conclusion of making the Rule absolute to the serious prejudice of petitioners denying justice; that the High Court Division has not applied judicial mind that the lower appellate Court has not given any reason whatsoever for reversing the judgment of the trial Court and such judgment being not a proper judgment of reversal to the serious prejudice of the petitioners occasioning a failure of justice the High Court Division has not properly exercised jurisdiction under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure to achieve justice in the Case of petitioners.<br/> <br/>5. Mr. M. Nurul Amin, learned Advocate, appearing for the respondent submits that the appellate Court in its finding portion of Exbt Ka(2) has held that "The defendant have examined 3 witnesses in all. C.S. record reveals that Jinnath Sheikh was in exclusive possession of the suit land and thus the heirs of the Junnat Ali being in exclusive possession mutated their names in the landlord sherista and had been paying rent in their names.<br/> <br/>6. From the evidence of PW 1 it is clear that the heirs of Jinnat Ali had never admitted the plaintiff as their co-sharers since the publication of their name in C.S. record i.e. 40 years back and that Jinnat Ali and his sons are in possession as sole owner to the knowledge of the plaintiff. From the evidence on record and from the  facts and circumstances of the Case, it is found that the defendant have been in possession of the disputed land for more than 12 years as of right and by asserting hostile title against the plaintiff or their predecessor and that there was a complete ouster and thus the right, title and interest of the plaintiff which they alleged had acquired in the properties had been lost by adverse possession and accordingly it is found that the decision of the Sub-ordinate Judge is justified.<br/> <br/>In view of the above, we find no substance in the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioners.<br/> <br/>Accordingly the leave petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
