(13)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Lawyers Involved: </strong><br/>AJ Mohammad Ali, Additional Attorney General (Naima Haider, Assistant Attorney General with him) instructed by B. Hossain Advocate on Record-For the Appellants.<br/>T. H. Khan, Senior Advocate, with Shafique Ahmed, senior Advocate, instructed by Md. Nowab Ali, Advocate- on-Record-For the Respondent.<br/> <br/><strong>Civil Appeal No. 237 of 2001 </strong><br/>(From the judgment and order dated 11-06-2000 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 1365 of 1997)<br/> <br/><strong>JUDGMENT</strong><br/> <br/><strong><u>Syed JR Mudasssir Husain J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This appeal by special leave at the instance of Government defendants is directed against the judgment and order dated 11-6-2000 in Civil Revision No. 1365 of 1997 passed by the High Court Division making the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>2. The plaintiff respondent No.1, Abdul Hakim filed Title Suit No. 60 of 1993 in the court Assistant Judge, First Court, Dhaka pray­ing for permanent injunction against the defen­dant Government of Bangladesh and other Government Officers restraining them from entering into the 'Ga' Schedule land part of the 'kha' schedule which is out side the land acquired in L.A. Case No. 13 of 1956-60. The plaintiff also made further prayer for declara­tion that "Ga' schedule land is not the part of acquired land published in the Gazette Notification dated 18-12-1980. The case of the plaintiff respondent is that 3.60 acres of land out of 23.43 acres of C.S. Dag No. 253 in C.S. Khatian No. 217 of mouza Bisil within Mirpur Police Station, District Dhaka was originally owned and passed by one Pir Baksh. In the year 1935 the said Pir Baksh died leaving behind two sons Jonab Ali and Jinnath Ali and two daughters Samina bibi and Jarina bibi as his legal heirs; that the aforesaid legal heirs for their convenience made amicable partition of the land amongst themselves and thereby the plaintiff respondent Abdul Hakim the son of late Jonab Ali got 1.20 acres in his share which is more fully described in the 'kha' schedule of the plaint and the respondent Abdul Hakim got his name mutated and had been owning and possessing this land peacefully. The Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh Acquired 14.70 Acres of land out of 23.43 acres in L.A. Case No. 13 of 1959-60 and Abdul Hakim (respondent) received com­pensation money for .92 decimals and hence 28 decimals of land in the share of the said plain­tiff respondent remained unacquired and over 12 decimals of land of Abdul Hakim was left unused after construction of the roads surround­ing it. The respondent Abdul Hakim clamed to have been owning and possessing 40 (28+12) decimals of land and this portion was not actu­ally acquired in L.A. Case No. 13 of 1959-60.<br/>Upon the aforesaid assertions the plaintiff respondent filed the aforesaid Title Suit and obtained a decree of permanent injunction.<br/> <br/>3. The defendant appellants by filing writ­ten statement contested the suit contending <em>inter alia</em> that the suit land was acquired in L.A. Case No. 13 of 1959-60 and Government took over possession of the same; that for acquisition the plaintiff respondent Abdul Hakim was given compensation money and received the same in full; and he got rehabilitation plot allotted for him. The further claim of the appellants that the plaintiff's suit is barred under Section 14, sub-section (1) of the (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act, 1948.<br/> <br/>4. The trial Court decreed the suit finding that the suit land described in the schedule 'Ga' of the plaint of not included in the acquired property and the plaintiff respondent has title and possession therein, the government defen­dant being aggrieved against the aforesaid judg­ment and decreed filed Title Appeal No. 359 of 1994. The learned Additional District Judge, after hearing the parties allowed the appeal by reversing the judgment and decree of the trial Court.<br/> <br/>5. The plaintiff-respondent being aggrieved thereby preferred Civil Revision No. 1365 of 1997 before the High Court Division and the Rule; obtained in the aforesaid Civil Revision was made absolute on 11-6-2000 by setting aside the judgment and decree of the appellate court and restored those of the trial court.<br/> <br/>6. The defendant Government being aggrieved preferred Civil Petition for leave to Appeal No. 657 of 2000 before the Appellate Division and the leave was granted. Hence, this appeal.<br/> <br/>7. Mr. AJ Mohammad Ali, the learned Additional Attorney General, appearing for the Government firstly contended that the Court of appeal below being the final court of fact hav­ing rightly reversed the findings of the trial court, the High Court Division sitting in the revisional jurisdiction has committed an error of law in setting aside the findings of facts arrived at by the lower appellate court with cogent reasons upon sufficiently discussing the materials on record.<br/> <br/>8. The learned Additional Attorney General has next contended that the land described in the schedule of the plaint having been acquired by the Government and plaintiff-respondent had received compensation money and there­after got allotment of rehabilitation plot for such acquisition, as such the High Court Division committed an error of law in not hold­ing that the plaintiff respondent has no cause for filing the suit against the Government in view of provision of Section 14 of the (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act, 1948 and that the suit is barred under Section 14(A) of the said act.<br/> <br/>9. It has been further contended by the appellant that the respondent filed Title Suit No.22 of 1993 in the Court of Assistant Judge, First Court, Dhaka in respect of the self same property and the said suit having been dis­missed, the High Court Division was in erred in law in decreeing the present suit which was barred by the principle of <em>res judicata</em>.<br/> <br/>10. Mr. T. H. Khan, the learned Counsel appearing for the plaintiff-respondents in sup­porting the impugned judgment of the High Court Division rightly submitted that the said has been found that the suit land is out side the land acquired in L.A. Case No. 13 of 1959-60 and plaintiff respondents has right, title, interest and possession in the suit property and the same has not been acquired in L.A Case No. 71 of 1960-61. Mr. T. H. Khan further argued that the lower appellate court being the final court of fact without reversing the findings and deci­sions of the learned trial Court illegally set aside the judgment and decree passed by the trial court and as such the High Court division in its revisional jurisdiction did not commit any error of law in reversing the judgment and decree of the lower appellate court.<br/> <br/>11. The whole argument of Mr. T. H., Khan is that entire land was not acquired in L.A. Case No. 13 of 1959-60 and the suit land was not acquired by the L.A. Case No. 71 of 1960-61 and no notice was served upon the plaintiff-respondent and in such view of the matter plaintiff respondent being in possession of the land in suit, High Court Division has rightly set aside the findings and decisions of the lower appellate court under its revisional jurisdiction.<br/> <br/>12. We have hared the submissions of the learned Counsels of the both parties with regard to the effect that notice under L.A Case No. 71 of 1959-60. We called for the entire records of the aforesaid L.A. Cases for our perusal, and on scrutiny thereof, we are satisfied that the notice was duly served upon the plaintiff respondent and others in connection with acquisition of the suit land and we are of the view acquisition of the land in suit and other land of the C.S. Plot was legally done under the Emergency Requisition of Property Act, 1948. Having regard to provision of law and on perusal of other materials on record we are of the view that under the facts and circumstances of the case the plaintiff respondent has/had no cause of action to file the suit rather the suit itself is not only barred by law but also barred under the principle of <em>res judicate</em>.<br/> <br/>13. Regard being had to the findings and decisions arrived at by the lower appellate court as to possession of the suit land which is based on materials on record we are of the view that the High Court Division exceeded in its revi­sional jurisdiction and illegally set aside the findings and decisions arrived at by the lower appellate court without noticing that the trial court was wrong in passing a decree for perma­nent injunction without any definite finding of possession in the land in suit by the plaintiff respondent . For the reasons stated above, we find substance in the submissions of the learned Additional Attorney General and the learned Additional Attorney General and consequently the impugned judgment of the High Court Division is liable to be set aside and the same is set aside.<br/> <br/>In the result, the appeal is allowed. The judgment of the lower appellate court is restored and the suit is dismissed. There is no order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
