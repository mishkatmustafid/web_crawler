No.408 of 2005)<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong><u>Mohammad Fazlul Karim J. </u></strong><br/> <br/>This petition for Leave to Appeal at the instance of the petitioner is directed against the judgment and order dated 31.08.2005 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Rule No. 524(F) of 2005 arising out of F.A.T. No.408 of 2005 making the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>2. The short fact relevant for disposal of the rule is that the Suit property is Rowafata Rowa beel, measuring 89.99 acres of land under Sadar Thana of Sunamganj District, originally belonged to Dewan Aftabur Raza Chowdhury Wakf Estate, subsequently Government acquired 12 annas shares of the case fisheries under the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950; the appellant petitioner as joint Mutawalli of Dewan Aftabur Reza Wakf Estate obtained the lease in the said 12 annas shares of government portion in the year of 1973 corresponding to 1380 B.S. at a rental of Tk.3,000.00; since the 4 annas share of the Wakf Estate is not acquired, the C.A/Roll is not finally published and thereafter the said order has been extended from time to time by the Government. Thereafter cancelled the said lease by the Memo No. S.A./Char-1/95/1986 dated 05.07.1995 on the ground of non-payment of rent from 1395 B.S. to 1401 B.S. The plaintiff petitioner then filed writ petition No.1540 of 1995 challenging tie said cancellation order vide Memo No.S.A./Char-1/95/1986 dated 05.07.1995 and Memo No.S.A./Char-1/95/1973 (1) dated 02.07.1995 and the tender notification under notification Memo No.S.A1./Chaf-1/5/95/1995 (200) dated 06.07.1995 and obtained the rule along with stay and the Deputy Commissioner, Sunamgonj was directed to accept rent only for the year 1402 B.S. from the petitioner. During the pendency of the said rule the present petitioner filed Title Suit No.44 of 2000 in the Court of Subordinate Judge, 1st Court, Sunamganj for declaration that the above Memo dated 05.07.1995, 02.07.1995 and 06.07.1995 were illegal, void and not binding upon the plaintiff. The High Court Division discharged the rule by the judgment and order dated 03.11.2003; Title Suit No.44 of 2000 was also dismissed by the judgment and Decree dated 16.06.2005 passed by the Joint District Judge, 1st Court, Sunamgonj.<br/> <br/>3. Thereafter the present petitioner filed F.A.T No.408 of 2005; in the meantime, government floated tender for leasing out the 12 annas government portion of Rowafata Rowa Beel for the year of 1412-1414 B.S. and the said fishery was leased out in favour of Madhya Bazar Union Fishermen Co-operative Society Limited, Dharmapasha at a consideration of Tk. 1,80,000.00. The said Society vide D.C.R. No. 33785/15 dated 17.07.2005 deposited no the lease money for the year of 1412 B.S, for that reason the present petitioner filed this injunction petition and obtained the rule.<br/> <br/>4. Mr. M.A. Samad, learned Senior Advocate, appearing for the petitioner submits that the impugned judgment of the High Court Division has for all legal and practical purposes rendered the First Appeal infractuous as such the Judgment and Order is liable to be set aside; that the High Court Division has failed to appreciate the terms and tenor of the order dated 28.05.1973 of the Ministry of Land Administration and land reform granting lease of the 12 annas share of the case Jalmohal to the appellant petitioner till final publication of Compensation Assessment Roll in respect of the 4 annas share of the said Jalmohal which is a Waqf Estate and thereby the High Court Division came to an erroneous decision, as such caused failure of justice; that the High Court Division without considering the implication of the order dated 16.10.1996 of the Ministry of Land staying the operation of the Compensation Assessment Roll in respect of the 4 annas share of the Jalmohal comprising Waqf Estate believed the affidavit of the Deputy Attorney General about the publication of the Compensation Assessment Roll and came to an erroneous decision that the appellant petitioner ceased to have any interest in the 12 annas share of the Jalmohal along with the 4 annas share of the Waqf Estate; that the High Court Division erred in holding that the appellant petitioner has no subsisting interest in the 12 annas share of the Jalmohal comprising the suit Jalmohal without considering that the appellant petitioner being a co-sharer in the entire Jalmohal has a preferential right to get lease of the same and the 12 annas suit Jalmohal and the 4, annas Jalmohal of the Waqf Estate are by nature and quality indivisibly connected and the said right was recognized by the Government in leasing out the suit Jalmohal by order dated 28.05.1973.<br/> <br/>5. It was argued that the High Court Division failed to consider that the material facts of the instant case are different from those in the case decisions namely <strong><em>Md. Sanu Miah versus The Government of Bangladesh </em></strong>reported in<strong><em> 1 MLR (AD) 297;</em></strong> <strong><em>Chaila Khal Nobam Khanda Matshy Zibi Samabai Samity Ltd. Versus Revenue Deputy Commissioner and others </em></strong>reported in<strong><em> 1 BLC 339</em></strong> and <strong><em>Mallikpur Fisherman Co-operative Society Ltd. Versus The Secretary Ministry of Land and others </em></strong>reported in<strong><em> 15 BLD (AD) 2241</em></strong> referred to by the High Court Division in the instant case, the appellant petitioner did not default in paying the annual lease money, rather, the local administration stopped taking lease money from 1392 B.S. though the petitioner tendered the same as is evident from the letter dated 26.06.1985 of the respondent No.3 and the appellant petitioner paid the lease money up to 1408 B.S. by virtue of the order of the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 1540 of 1995 and that the respondents again stopped receiving rent from 1409 B.S. after institution of Title Suit No.44 of 2000 and in the above facts, the cancellation of the lease by the respondent No.3 for non payment of the lease money for the years 1395 B.S. to 1401 B.S. is <em>ex-facie</em>, illegal and malafide and non-consideration of the same by the High Court Division led to erroneous decision, which caused serious miscarriage of justice;<br/> <br/>6. The petitioner further alleged that the High Court Division did not consider that the validity of the order of cancellation of the lease and possession of the appellant petitioner in the suit Jalmohal are matter to be decided in the First Appeal and consequently the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division disposing the civil rule on the finding about legality or illegality of possession arid direction to float fresh Tender in collaboration with the petitioner amount to prejudging the First Appeal and rendering the First Appeal infractuous; that the High Court Division failed to consider during pendency of Title Suit No.44 of 2000 the Court below after hearing both the parties granting injunction in respect of the possession of 12 annas share of the case Jalmohal in favour of the Appellant Petitioner and the same was also upheld by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.2984 of 2003 and as such the appellant petitioner is entitled for temporary injunction in respect of possession till disposal of the First Appeal, otherwise the cause of action of the appeal would be infractuous; that having regard to the fact that the lease was cancelled by the respondent No.3 under its memo No.1983 dated 05.07.1995 without giving any opportunity or any show cause notice before publication of the alleged Compensation Assessment Roll dated 04.07.1996 by the Respondent no.2 and thereafter, the said Compensation Assessment Roll was subsequently stayed by the respondent No.2 dated 16.10.1996 but the High Court Division have failed to consider the above material facts thereby, led to the erroneous deception.<br/> <br/>7. It was further alleged that the High Court Division failed to consider that the lease was  granted  in  favour  of  the appellant-petitioner by the respondent  No.2 dated 28.05.1973 but the said lease was illegally cancelled by the respondent No.3 dated 05.07.1995, as such the said cancellation is without lawful authority, therefore, the judgment and order is liable to be set aside; that the High Court Division has failed to consider that during <em>lis pendens</em> of the appeal the respondents floated and accepted Tender disregarding the application as well as the Certificate of the Advocate of the appellant and that subsequent status-quo Order of the High Court Division inasmuch as the High Court Division also did not consider the application for mandatory injunction of the appellant petitioner dated 14.08.2005..<br/> <br/>8. It appears from, the record that in the disputed Jalmohal measuring 89.99 acres land Government has 12 annas shares i.e. 66.88 acres and the rest 4 annas share belongs to Aftabur Raza Chowdhury Waqf Estate. But in the meantime Government acquired the rest 4 annas share and the C.A. Roll already published. The plaintiff-petitioner took lease of 12 annas share of the Jalmohal in 1380 B.S. at the rate of TK. 3,000.00 per year and he possessed the said Jalmohal up to 1409 B.S. by paying the lease money. In the meantime, the petitioner filed W.P.No.1540 of 1995 and obtained the Rule and the said Rule has been discharged by the judgment dated 02.11.2003. The plaintiff-petitioner filed Title Suit No.44 of 2000 before the Subordinate fudge, 1st Court, Sunamgonj and the said suit was dismissed by the judgment and decree dated 16.06.2005. The petitioner as a lease holder possessed the said Jalmohal up to 1409 B.S. and his lease term had already expired and in the meantime the Government leased out the said Jalmahal. It is fact that the present petitioner has no lease order after 1409 B.S. The settled principle of law is that in order to get an order of temporary injunction the plaintiff must have a <em>prima facie</em> and arguable case. In this case it is clear that the plaintiff-petitioner has no right in respect of 12 annas share since acquired and vested in the Government and for the reason an order of temporary or ad-interim injunction cannot be granted when the plaintiff has no subsisting interest in the disputed Jalmahal. The case of <strong><em>Md.</em></strong><strong><em> Sanu Miah vs. the Government of Bangladesh and others </em></strong>reported in<strong><em> 1 MLR (AD) 354</em></strong> support the said proposition of law.<br/> <br/>9. It appears from the record that the plaintiff was given lease of the aforesaid Jalmahal for 3 years and the lease period had expired on 30th Chaitra 1409 B.S. and as such, the plaintiff had no subsisting legal right in the said Jalmahal to pray for injunction and the subsequent alleged possession of the plaintiff in the suit fishery is no possession in the eye of law. The alleged possession is a possession by a trespasser which cannot be protected by any Court of law. If the plaintiff has suffered anything due to the activities of the Government in leasing out the suit fishery afresh to 3rd party by putting it into auction. The plaintiff's remedy lies elsewhere but not by way of injunction.<br/> <br/>10. In view of the above, we find no substance in the submissions of the learned advocate for the petitioner.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
