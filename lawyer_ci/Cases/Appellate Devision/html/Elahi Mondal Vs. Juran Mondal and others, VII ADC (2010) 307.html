Muzammel Hossain J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This civil review petition is directed against the judgment and order dated 30.07.2008 passed by the Appellate Division in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 697 of 2007 dismissing the same.<br/> <br/>2. The respondent No.1 as plaintiff filed Title Suit No.62 of 1988 for declaration of his title in .21 acres of land in plot No.243 and .17 acres in plot No.254 of Mouza Gobindapur, Police Station and District-Jhenaidah and for recovery of possession of .04 acre of land of plot No.243 and entire .17 acre of land of plot No.254.<br/> <br/>3. In the said suit the plaintiff stated, <em>inter alia</em>, that .21 acres of land of plot No.243 belong to Nayeb Ali and others and they transferred the same to Abdur Rahim Sheikh by a deed of Sale dated 08.02.39 and after his death his son Mahatab Sheikh got the same and he settled the same in favour of Hemat Ali, thereafter the plaintiff on the 14th Chaitra, 1346 B.S.; that .17 acres of land in plot No. 254 was settled to Abdur Rahim Sheikh by aforesaid Nayab Ali on 04.08.38 and Tezarat and Alekjan on 08.02.39 by patta. After death of said Rahim Sheikh his son Mahatab got the same and by a registered Kabuliyat dated 28.5.48 he settled the same in favour of father of the petitioner; that the father of the plaintiff orally gifted the said .21 acre of land of plot No. 243 and the same was recorded in the name of the petitioner; that the father of the petitioner transferred .17 acres of land of plot No.254 in favour of the petitioner by a sale deed dated 23.1.1997; that for the first time on 15th magh, 1383 B.S. the petitioner could know that .17 acre of land of plot No. 254 was wrongly recorded in the name of Rajab Ali and Makshed Ali and against the said wrong recording the petitioner filed Title suit No. 256 of 1973 and the same was decreed <em>ex parte; </em>that regarding .21 acre of land of plot No. 243, Title Suit No. 690 of 1976 was filed. During pendency of the said suit there was a compromise and it was decided that the petitioner will possess "Kha" schedule land and the said Rahela will possess "Ka" schedule land but no deed of exchange was executed; that in the mean­time the defendant dispossessed the plaintiff from "Kha" schedule land on 25.03.86; that thereafter defendant No.5 dispossessed the plaintiff, subsequently there was a <em>shalish</em> and the defendant handed over .17 acres from "Ka" schedule of land to the plaintiff and he is living with his family on the said land and since defendants are denying the title of the plaintiff in the suit land he is compelled to file the instant suit.<br/> <br/>4. The petitioner as defendant No.1 con­tested the suit by filing written statement stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that Rahim Sheikh, being owner in the land of both the schedules died leaving behind only son Mahtab Sheikh and he orally settled the same to Barkatullah Mollah in 1346 B.S. and sub­sequently on his demand executed and reg­istered a Kabuliyat dated 07.06.1948 and the aforesaid landlord accepted the said Kabuliyat and granted Dakhila accepting him as a tenant; that subsequently said Barkatullah transferred his instrest in the said land to Yousuf Ali Biswas by execut­ing a registered patta dated 16.07.1952; that Yousuf Ali Biswas being owner and possessor of the said land transferred to Rajab Ali Kazi and Maksed Ali Kazi by registered sale deed dated 19 Kartik 1362 B.S. thereafter they transferred the same to Hasina Khatun by a registered deed of sale dated 03.10.1973; that said Hasina Khatun transferred the same to Rahela Khatun by a registered deed of sale dated 27.02.1976 and she was possessing the same through defendant No.1 who is her bargadar; that Rahela Khatun entered an agreement to transfer the said land to Elahi Mondal, defendant No.1 and one Lutfor Rahman who was her relation: that since said Rahela Khatun did not execute deed of transfer, within time the defendant and said Lutfar Rahman filed a suit for specific per­formance of contract and obtained sale deed from Court on 23.05.1990 by filing a suit for specific performance of contact; that subsequently the defendant entered into an agreement to transfer the suit land to Mojibur Rahman and on acceptance of Taka 24,000/- handed over possession of the suit land and said Mojibur Rahman is a bona fide purchaser of the suit land for value and before Mojibur Rahman the defendant possessed the suit land for more that 12 years; that already a Miscellaneous Case has been filed to set aside the decree obtained by the petitioner against Rahela and this circumstances the instant suit filed by the plaintiff is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/>5. The learned Senior Assistant Judge, Jhenaidah by the judgment and decree dated 20.08.1999 decreed the suit. Being aggrieved by the said judgment and decree the defendant-petitioner preferred Title Appeal No.125 of 1999 which was dis­missed by the judgment and decree dated 30.06.2000. Being aggrieved by the said judgment and decree the defendant pre­ferred Civil Revision No.3380 of 2000 before the High Court Division who by the judgment and order dated 25.01.2007 dis­charged the Rule affirming the concurrent finding of facts passed by the courts below observing that there is no reason to inter­fere with the judgment and decree passed by the court of appeal below as there is no illegality in the said Judgment and order.<br/> <br/>6. Thereafter the petitioner being aggrieved by the aforesaid Judgment and order filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.697 of 2007 before this Division which was dismissed by the judgment and order dated 30.07.2008. The petitioner being aggrieved by the afore­said judgment and order dated 30.07.2008 preferred the instant Civil Review Petition before the Appellate Division.<br/> <br/>7. We have heard Mr. N. K. Saha, the learned Senior Advocate appearing for the petitioner, and Mr. Nawab Ali, the learned Advocate-On-Record appearing for the respondent No.1 and perused the impugned judgment of this Division and also perused the other judgments in ques­tion and also other materials available on record. It appears that in the Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal this Division consid­ered  the submissions of  the learned Advocate for the petitioner to the effect that the trial court decreed the suit hold­ing that the plaintiff claimed his title on the basis  of deed of settlement  dated 28.05.1948 which was registered prior to the registered kabuliyat dated 07.06.1948 produced by the defendant and further the title of the plaintiff has already been declared in Title Suit No. 265 of 1976 and though the defendant claimed the Title Suit No. 295 of 1996 challenging the decree passed in the Title Suit No. 265 of 1976 yet he did not get any relief therein and further the evidence on record also show that the plaintiff was given posses­sion in kha schedule land but thereafter the plaintiff was dispossessed from a por­tion thereof.<br/> <br/>8. The Appellate Division in dismissing the leave petition rightly observed as follows:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"It appears that the High Court Division on a meticulous examina­tion of the judgment of the trial Court as well as lower appellate Court and also considering evidence on record held that the lower appellate Court after discussing the evidence both oral and documentary, elaborately and after proper assessment of evidence on record came to the finding that the plaintiff had been able to prove his right title and possession in the suit land and further the concurrent find­ing of facts should not be disturbed unless it is manifestly perverse and some are of the view that there being no illegality or infirmity in the above decision no interference is called for."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>9. Having considered all the aspect of the matter we are of the view that this Division earlier in dismissing the leave petition took into consideration all rele­vant materials on record and arrived on a correct decision and as such we do not find any new ground for review of the impugned Judgment and order.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, this review petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
