The petitioner as plaintiff filed Partition Suit No.67 of 1987 in the Court of 1st Sub-judge, Chittagong for partition of the suit land stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the' suit land as described in the schedule to the plaint belonged to Ochi Miah Chowdhury in whose name R.S. Khatian was prepared correctly and during his life time he gifted 264 chhataks of land to his 4 sons by 2nd wife namely Shamsul Hilda, defendant No. 1, Mohammad Shofi, Farid Ahmed and Mahabubul Hoque by a registered gift deed dated 16.06.1965 being No. 3001; that while possessing the same Mahabubul Hoque died and thereafter his share was developed to other brothers and sisters and after the death of Md. Shafi, defendant Nos.2-5 became owner of his left property and after death of Farid Ahmed defendant No. 6-8 became owner of his left property; that while possessing the same defendant Nos.6-8 transferred 0.50 chhataks of land (2 ½ gandas) to the plaintiff by a exchange deed being No.542 dated 06.07.1987 and accordingly he has been possessing the same as ejmali property with the defen­dants; that he has mutated his name for the said land vide Mutation Case No. 197 of 1987-88 and has been running his busi­ness therein on payment of rents and by holding trade licence from the Paurashava; that Ochi Miah was owner of the rest 0.14 decimals of land during his life time and after his death defendant Nos. 1-25 became owner of that land as his heirs; that during his life time Ochi Miah also let out the house situated there­on to the defendant Nos. 26-29 and accord­ingly they are in possession as tenants under the said heirs of Ochi Miah; that the plaintiff is owner of 2 ½  gandas of land and he has been in possession of that quantum of land out of 0.278 chhataks as described in the schedule to the plaint.<br/> <br/>3. The defendant Nos. 1-5 and 6-8 filed two separate written statement against the said prayer for injunction denying the material contents and allegations of the plaintiff made in the petition for tempo­rary injunction alleging, <em>inter alia,</em> that except 2 ½ gandas land as claimed by the plaintiff the defendants have been in pos­session of rest part of the suit land as described in the schedule to the plaint and since they are in specific possession as heirs of the original owner Ochi Miah and the Court below was pleased to pass an order directing the parties to maintain sta­tus quo of the suit property; that it may be stated that the defendant Nos. 1-8 did not file any appeal against the order of status quo.<br/> <br/>4. Thereafter, on 13.04.1993 the defendant Nos. 1-8 filed an application for permission to make construction in their portion out of the total suit land in which they have been in possession, but that application was kept with the record without passing any order.<br/> <br/>5. Mr. A. J. Mohammad Ali, learned Counsel, appearing for the petitioner sub­mits that the order of status quo regarding possession and transfer of the suit proper­ty without modifying or making any vari­ation of the said order, the High Court Division was wrong to grant permission to construct a building upon the land in pos­session of the defendant and as such his decision merits interference by this Court; that without any documentary evidence of the parties regarding exclusive possession of the defendants in the suit land, the High Court Division was wrong to hold of such possession by the defendants and while deciding in an interlocutory matter of tem­porary injunction decided the merit of the suit and thereby prejudging the matter.<br/> <br/>6. The learned Counsel farther submits that the impugned order dated 28.03.2004 passed by the Additional Assistant Judge, 1st Court, Chittagong in Partition Suit No.58 of 1991 arose out of an Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure is appellable order under Order 43, Rule 1(h) of the Code of Civil Procedure but the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division was wrong to entertain the application under Section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure and the defendant waived and acquired his right of further relief against the orders dated 12.08.1993 and 29.06.1999 and thus the laches in the conduct of the defendant disentitled them to the assistance of the Court but the High Court Division was wrong to make the Rule absolute in a wrong forum. Last of all, Mr. Ali submits that the Civil Revision was not proper because under the amendment of Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure under Act 40 of 2003 first revision was to be filed in the Court of District Judge under Section 115 (2) for the revise any decree or order and if any party being aggrieved by a revision was to be filed under Section 115(4) for granting leave for revision and the grounds of the application is also to be taken for revising against the order impugned but in the application in Civil Revision No. 3696 of 2004, there was no compliance of such mandatory provision of law and the High Court Division was wrong to entertain the application which is not in proper form and as such its decision merits interference by this Division.<br/> <br/>7. Syed Mahbubur Rahman, learned Advocate-on-Record, appearing for the respondent Nos. 1-8 has referred to the finding and observation of the Court of below as under;<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"The land under partition is situated with­in the Chittagong Municipality. Admittedly the defendant has been in pos­session to some portion of the land under partition. Before this Court, the defendant petitioner by submitting a supplementary affidavit undertakes to demolish his build­ing if any portion of the building falls in the saham of the plaintiff at the final parti­tion. He undertakes to demolish the said building at his own cost and at his own risk and peril and undertakes to hand over vacant possession in favour of the plain­tiff. This portion has not been denied by the plaintiff by filing a counter affidavit."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>8.  Mr. Fazlul Karim in support of his sub­mission referred to a decision in the case of <strong><em>Fahim Ali-Huq and others vs. Md. Abdul Aziz, </em></strong>reported in<strong><em> 43 DLR 226</em></strong>. A similar case came up before this Court and a Division of this Court accorded permis­sion for construction on condition that if any portion of the constructed area falls in the saham of another co-sharer in posses­sion thereof shall be given to the plaintiff by demolishing the constructions. The view taken in that decision is squarely applicable in the present case. From the facts and circumstances and the undertak­ing given by the defendant before this Court by filing a supplementary affidavit, I find merit in the Rule and submitted that the impugned order basing on the submission of the learned Advocate incorpo­rated as aforesaid shall not prejudice any party and accordingly should not be dis­turbed.<br/> <br/>9. We have perused the finding of the High Court Division and found considerable force in the submission of the learned Advocate-on-Record for the petitioner.<br/> <br/>10. In view of the above, we find no sub­stance in the submissions of the learned Advocate for the respondent.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the Civil Petition is dis­missed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>
