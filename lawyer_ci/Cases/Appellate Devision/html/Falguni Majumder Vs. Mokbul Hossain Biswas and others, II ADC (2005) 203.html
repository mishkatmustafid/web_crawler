Appeal No. 48 of 1988 reversing the order dated 13.12.86 passed by the learned Munsif, Nowabgonj in O.C. Suit No. 231 of 1986 reject­ing an application filed by the present appellant under Order 22 Rule 10 CPC for being substi­tuted in place of shebayet -Defendants.<br/> <br/>2. Plaintiff-Respondent Nos. 1, 2 and others instituted O.C. Suit no. 612 of 1966 in the Court of Sadar Munsif Rajshahi, renumbered as O.C. Suit No. 507 of 1968 and subsequently again renumbered as O.C. Suit 231 of 1986 of the Court of Munsif, 3th Court, Nowabgonj, impleading the Dieties Sree Sree Durgamata Thakurani, Sree Sree Kalimata Thakurani and Sree Sree Katrik Deb Thakur represented by the Shebayet Sree Bhobesh Chandra Das and sever­al others as defendants for declaration that the decree passed in O.C.Suit No. 228 of 1960 (in respect of the suit property) is illegal, void fraudulent and not binding upon them. On the death of the Shebayet his heirs viz Sree Chittaranjan Das, Sree Ranjan Das and Sree Horendra Nath Das were substituted as defen­dants. On 27.9.86 the appellant, an advocate of Nowabgonj Bar, as the Secretary of Protab Chandra Das Debattar Trust committee filed an application under order 22 Rule 10 read with Section 145 of the Code of Civil Procedure for being added as defendant in the suit stating, inter alia, that Late Protab Chandra Das, a Businessman of Nawabgonj in the year 1332 B.S. dedicated the suit properties to his family Deities, mentioned above, by registered Arpannama. Last Shebayet Chitta Ranjan Das migrated to India in 1981 without making any arrangement to perform Sheba Puja and look after the debattar property, that the local Hindu community in a meeting held on 31.12.81 formed a broad-based trust committee and elected the appellant as its Secretary, that since the said property has devolved upon the trust committee he as the Secretary of the committee for the ends of justice should be made legal representative of the Deities to defend the suit.<br/> <br/>3. The trial court rejected the said applica­tion holding, inter alia, that the Arpannama does not contain the suit plots. On an appeal, preferred by the appellant, the appellate court set aside the order of trial court and allowed substitution of the appellant in the suit under order 22 Rule 10 C.P.C holding, inter alia, that an interest being devolved upon the appellant he is entitled to contest the suit as a defendant under Order 22 Rule 10 C.P.C.<br/> <br/>4. The aggrieved plaintiffs then took a revi­sion in the High Court Division against the said appellate judgment and order and obtained a Rule. The appellant received the notice of the Rule on 4.6.88 and thereafter engaged Mr. Abdul Mannan Khan Advocate at Rangpur Bench. But in pursuance of the judgment of the Appeallate Division on the 8th Amendment of the Constitution of Bangladesh the record of the said Rule was transferred to Dhaka bench. It was heard and disposed of ex parte by a Single Judge of the High Court Division by Judgment and order dated 12.5.92 whereby the Rule was made absolute upon setting aside the said appel­late order. Thereafter the appellant filed on 4.8.92 an application for re-hearing the Rule stating, inter alia, that his aforesaid engaged Advocate Mr. Abdul Mannan Khan died in October 1990 and as such he could not know that his case on being shifted to Dhaka Bench was disposed of on 12.5.92. The learned Single Judge of the High Court Division by the impugned Judgment and Order dated 6.8.92 summarily rejected the said application for re­hearing of the Rule upon taking a view that on the prayer of Mr. Abdul Mannan Advocate the matter was fixed for hearing on 19.11.91 and thereafter the learned Advocate took several adjournments in the matter and ultimately it was heard on 26.4.92 and the judgment was delivered on 12.5.92 and as such the allegation of the present appellant that his Advocate did not know about the hearing of the Rule is not correct.<br/> <br/>5. Leave was granted to consider whether the learned Judge of the High Court Division upon an erroneous assumption of the material facts wrongly held that since the appellant's learned Advocate Mr. Abdul Mannan after tak­ing adjournment of hearing of the Rule, on sev­eral times ultimately failed to appear on the date of hearing of the Rule, he had knowledge of the disposal of the case.<br/> <br/>6. Mr. Mansur Habib, learned Advocate appearing for the appellant submits that the record of the Rule was transmitted from Dhaka to Rangpur Bench and again to Dhaka Bench and no notice was given to the appellant informing such transmission of the record of the case and in the meanwhile his engaged lawyer Mr. Abdul Mannan Khan died in October 1990 without filing any vokalatnama in the case. The learned Advocate further submits that the High Court Division under a wrong assumption that when the matter was listed for hearing the appellant's Advocate took adjournment and ultimately failed to appear at the time of hear­ing. Mr. M.A. Mannan was not his Advocate but he appeared for the petitioner of the Rule, whereas the appellant was an Opposite-party in the Rule. As such the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division acted illegally in not re-hearing the matter for the ends of justice.<br/> <br/>7. Dr. Rafiqur Rahman, learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff-respondent No. 1, could not show that the appellant's Advocate Mr. Abdul Mannan Khan had appeared in the Rule in the High Court Division and prayed for adjournment of the hearing of the same.<br/> <br/>8. It appears that during the transitional period of setting up Benches of the High Court Division outside the capital the case record of the Rule in question was transmitted once from Dhaka to Rangpur and then from Rangpur to Dhaka but no notice of such transmission of case record from Rangpur to Dhaka was given to the opposite party of the Rule i.e. the present appellant. Evidently the learned Judge of the High Court Division failed to consider the uncontroversted assertion of the present appel­lant as the opposite party in the Rule that he had engaged Mr. Abdul Mannan Khan at Rangpur as his Advocate for the Rule but because of his death in October 7.8.92 and he came to Dhaka on 15.8.92 and thereafter instructed his lawyer to take steps for rehearing of the Rule.<br/> <br/>9. Thus in the facts and circumstances of the case and in view of the finding of the lower appellate court that because of the formation of a trust committee, the appellant as the Secretary of the committee was entitled to be substituted under order 22 Rule 10 C.P.C. in the suit in question, we have no hesitation to hold that the learned Judge of the High Court Division upon taking an erroneous assumption of the real facts wrongly passed the impugned judgment.<br/> <br/>10. Moreover, it is a well-settled principle of Hindu Law that a Deity has also right of its own to have a suit instituted or defended by a next friend. In case of family Deity, even a worshipper other than the Shebayet or members of the family in a proper case may apply to the court for being appointed as the next friend to protect-the interest of the Deity and in such a case a duty is cast upon the court to examine as to whether if such worshipper if so appointed the interest of the Deity would be adequately protected.<br/> <br/>11. In that view of the matter we are inclined to allow the appeal without, however, any order as to cost. Accordingly the impugned of the High Court Division dated 6.8.92 as well as the judgment and order dated 12.5.92 are set aside and the judgment and order of the lower appellate court is restored.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
