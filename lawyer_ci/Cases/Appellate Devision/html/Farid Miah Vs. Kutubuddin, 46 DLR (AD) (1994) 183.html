The plaintiff brought Title Suit No. 301 of 1972 in the First Court of the Assistant Judge, Sylhet, for a declaration that the order of cancellation of settlement of land dated 18.9.72 passed by the Assistant Custodian, Enemy Property, Sylhet, Defendant No. 2 in EP Case No. 11/70-71 was void, illegal, etc. and also for permanent injunction. His case briefly, is that the suit land was declared as enemy property by Defendant No. 2 in EP Case No. 11/70-71 as the owners thereof, namely Suresh Chandra Bhattacharjee, Bankesh Chandra Bhattacharjee and Poresh Chandra Bhattacharjee left for India for good. The plaintiff is a co‑sharer of the suit land and so he applied for taking settlement of the same and was allowed settlement by defendant No. 2 by his Memo No. 290 dated 18.5.72. Thus he has been in possession of the suit land on payment of rent. But defendant No. 2 having been influenced by defendants Nos. 3, 4 and 5 illegally cancelled the plaintiffs settlement on 18.9.72 on the allegation that he is a Government Servant and so he is not entitled to get any settlement of enemy property. But the plaintiff is not a Government Servant. After cancellation of his settlement, the defendants Nos. 3, 4 and 5 threatened the plaintiff with dispossession. Hence the suit.<br/> <br/>3. Defendants Nos. 1 to 5 contested the suit by filing two separate written statements. Their common case, briefly, is that the plaintiff has got no right, interest or possession in the suit land. He is not a co‑sharer of the suit land which is an enemy property. He is a Government Servant. But he obtained the settlement of the suit land upon misrepresentation of fact and practising fraud, and so, his lease was rightly cancelled by defendant No. 2. Then the property was leased out to defendants Nos. 3 to 5 who are co‑sharers of the suit land and defendants Nos. 3 to 5 have been in possession thereof. Their settlement was rightly granted by defendant No. 2. The cancellation of the plaintiffs' lease was made legally after hearing both sides. The plaintiff filed this suit on false allegations.<br/> <br/>4. The learned Assistant Judge, by judgment and decree dated 30.6.76, dismissed the suit but on appeal, the learned Subordinate Judge, Second Court, Sylhet, set aside the same and decreed the suit by his judgment and decree dated 29.12.77. Defendants 3‑5 then filed the aforesaid Second Appeal in which the impugned judgment was passed.<br/> <br/>5. It appears that leave was granted to consider whether the view taken by the High Court Division that a Government Servant was not entitled to take settlement of an enemy property was correct. Mr. MH Khandker, learned Counsel for the, appellant, contended that the plaintiff was not a Government Servant, that he being a co‑sharer by exchange and there having been no partition of the suit land, the order of cancellation of his settlement was arbitrary and illegal and the ground that he was a Government Servant had no basis.<br/> <br/>6. Syed Ishatiaq Ahmed, learned Counsel for respondent Nos. 1 to 8, submitted upon referring to the impugned judgment that the High Court Division having clearly found that there was no substance in the contention that a Government Servant was not entitled to take lease of an Enemy Property, the leave obtained by the appellant was a misconceived one and the other findings in the impugned judgment having not been assailed, there is no scope to make any further enquiry in this appeal.<br/> <br/>7. It is true that one of the reasons for cancellation of the plaintiffs settlement was that of his being a Government Servant but neither the trial Court which dismissed the suit nor the High Court Division which affirmed it, upheld the order of cancellation on that ground. It is, therefore, immaterial to consider whether the plaintiff was a Government Servant or not. Mr. Khandker, having found himself in this predicament that leave was not obtained on any other ground, submitted that he may be permitted to raise other grounds in support of the appeal.<br/> <br/>8. We, have considered the submission of Mr. Khandker, the grounds taken in the leave petition, the judgment of the Courts below and the impugned judgment in the light of the facts of the case and found no special reason either to grant further leave or to allow any other point to be raised for further consideration. It will be seen that the Plaintiffs settlement was not in accordance with the Enemy Property (Lands and Buildings) Administration and Disposal Order, 1966, in that in terms of section 4 of that Order, the Custodian could grant lease of Enemy Property for a period not exceeding one year at a time, but in the present case, defendant No. 2 "granted lease of some unidentified land as Enemy Property to the plaintiff for a period of 7 years at a time and that period expired after 1379 BS". Although the learned Subordinate Judge sought to explain that the lease was for one year only i.e. for 1379 BS the plaintiff himself claimed that the lease was for 7 years. The learned Judge of the High Court Division found that the learned Subordinate Judge misconstrued the document Ext. 2 and that the lease not being of one year only, the settlement in question given to the plaintiff is illegal, The learned Judge of the High Court Division also found that defendants Nos. 4 and 5 being the full brothers of the original owners, they would get preference over the plaintiff and the cancellation of the plaintiff's lease and settlement with the defendants were, therefore, legal. Be that as it may, that period of lease of the plaintiff having already expired with the expiry of 1379 BS and there being no fresh settlement order in his favour, the plaintiff has no subsisting interest to maintain the suit. It has been noticed that under section 4 of the aforesaid Order, the plaintiff was not entitled to hold over after the expiry of the period of lease. The other points which Mr. Khandker sought leave to argue, therefore, do not seem to be of much substance in the facts noticed above.<br/> <br/>9. In the result, therefore, the appeal is dismissed without any order as to cost.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
