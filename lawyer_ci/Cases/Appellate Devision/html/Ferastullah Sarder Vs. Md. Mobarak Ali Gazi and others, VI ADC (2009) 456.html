Abdul Matin J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>These petitions for leave to appeal are directed against the  judgment and order dated 29.11.2006 passed in Civil Revision No.3467 of 1995 heard and disposed of analogously with Civil Revision No.3466 of 1995 by the High Court Division making the Rule absolute in both the Civil Revision reversing the judgment and decree dated 12.11.1994 passed in Title Appeal No.209  of 1991 heard and disposed of analogously with the Title Appeal No.201 of 19961 dismissing the appeal by the learned Subordinate Judge Artha Rin Adalat, Khulna affirming the judgment and decree dated 13.06.1993 passed in Title Suit No.56 of 1991 by the learned Assistant Judge, Koyra decreeing the suit.<br/> <br/>2. The facts, in short, are that Ferastullah predecessor of the petitioners as plaintiffs instituted a Title Suit No.56 of 1991 in the court of the learned Assistant Judge Koyra against the respondent for declaration of title and confirmation of possession and  permanent injunction on the allegation, <em>inter alia</em>, that the land measuring 162.58 acres of land appertaining to C.S. Khatian No. 294 belonged to Kalachand Gazi, Haziruddin Gazi and Mofizuddin Gazi Kalachand Gazi mortgaged 1.98 acres of  land to the plaintiff on 26.04.1943 by registered kabuliat. The plaintiff became korfa tenant under Kalachand Gazi and paid rent to him. The R.S. and S.A. record was made and finally published in the name of the plaintiff. The defendant Nos.1 &amp; 2 fraudulently got their names mutated in Miscellaneous Case No.9 of 1984-85. The notices of that case were not served upon the plaintiff. The plaintiff filed review case against such mutation which was allowed and the previous position of khatian was restored. The notices and sale proclamation of the sale as alleged was not served upon the plaintiff. There was no arrear of rent of the suit land 1.91 acres of land as has been sold at a Tk.153/-. If any documents are filed by the defendant Nos.1 &amp; 2 that will be presumed to be forged, collusive. The plaintiff filed Miscellaneous Case No.6 of 1985-86 which was allowed. Thereafter, the defendant Nos.1 &amp; 2 filed Revision No.22 of 1986 before Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) who was pleased to allow the same. The plaintiff filed a review which was rejected against which the plaintiff filed Appeal No.229 of 1989 before Additional Divisional Commissioner who was pleased to dis­miss the same. The order of Additional Divisional Commissioner (Revenue) was challenged by the plaintiff before the Revenue Board which is still pending. On 25.05.1988 from Revision Case No.22 of 1986, the plaintiff for the first time came to know about the forged decree passed in Title Suit No. 273 of 1956. The defendant Nos.1 &amp; 2 filed Title Suit No. 219 of 1989 for permanent injunction which was dis­missed against which they preferred Title Appeal No.209 of 1991 which is still pending on 29.09.1991 the defendant Nos.1 &amp; 2 threatened the plaintiff with dis­possession and as such he was constrained to file suit.<br/> <br/>3. The respondent Nos.1 and 2 as defen­dant Nos.1 and 2 contested the suit by fil­ing a written statement on the allegation, <em>inter-alia,</em> that Kala Chand mortgaged the suit land to Ferastullah on 12.04.1943 For getting back the suit land Kala Chand filed Title Suit No. 273 of 1956 which was decreed on compromise wherein he admit­ted the claim of these defendants. Thereafter the suit land was sold in auc­tion in certificate cases Nos.7511 of 1959-60 and 1032 of 1961-62 for arrear of rent which was purchased by Abu Taleb and others. Sons of Kala Chand Gazi got delivery of possession through court. Then the auction purchaser sold to these defen­dants on 12.05.1967 and 13.05.1967 by registered kabalas. These defendants got their names mutated. The plaintiff unsuc­cessfully moved up land appeal board for getting the auction sale set aside. The suit is bad for defects of parties and hit by law of limitation and also hit by section 42 of the Specific Relief Act.<br/> <br/>4. The Assistant Judge by his judgment and decree dated 13.06.1993 decreed the suit in part and title to the plaintiff was declared and recovery of khas possession was decreed instead of confirmation of possession.<br/> <br/>5. Against the said judgment and decree the respondent Nos.1 and 2 filed Title Appeal No. 201 of 1993.<br/> <br/>6. The Respondent Nos.1 and 2 herein as plaintiffs instituted another Title Suit being No.49 of 1989 in the court of the learned Assistant Judge, Koyra for perma­nent injunction on the allegation contend­ing, <em>inter-alia</em>, that Kala Chand mortgaged the suit land to Ferastullah on 24.04.1943. For getting back the suit land Kala Chand filed Title Suit No.273 of 1956 which was decreed on compromise wherein he admit­ted the claim of these defendants. Thereafter the suit land was sold in auc­tion in certificate cases Nos.7511 of 1959-60 and 1032 of 1961-62 for arrear of rent which was purchased by Abu Teleb and others. Sons of Kala Chand Gazi and got delivery of possession through court. Then the auction purchasers sold to these defen­dants on 12.05.1967 and 13.05.1967 by registered kabalas. These defendants got their names mutated. The plaintiff unsuc­cessfully moved up to land appeal board for getting the auction sale set aside. The suit is bad for defects of parties and hit by law of limitation and also hit be section 42 of the Specific Relief Act.<br/> <br/>7. The predecessor these petitioners con­tested the said by filing a written state­ment on the allegation as stated in the plaint of file Suit No. 56 of 1991.<br/> <br/>8. The learned Assistant Judge by judgment and decree dated 11.06.1991 dismissed Title Suit No.49 of 1989 against the decree passed in Title Suit No.49 of 1989 the respondent herein filed Title I Appeal No.209 of 1991 and against the decree passed in Title Suit No.56 of 1991 the respondents Nos.1 and 2 herein filed Title Appeal No.201 of 1993.<br/> <br/>9. The above mentioned Title Appeal  Nos.201 of 1993 and 209 of 1991 were transferred to the court of the learned Subordinate Judge and Artha Rin Adalat and both the appeals were head and disposed of analogously and the learned court of appeal below by judgment and decree dated 12.11.1994 dismissed both the appeals on affirming the judgment and  decree passed in Title Suit No.49 of 1989  and by modifying the decree in Title Suit No.56 of 1991 in decreeing the suit for declaration of title and confirmation of possession and compromise decree in Title Suit No.273 of 1956 and auction sale in certificate case No.7519 of 199-160, 1032 of 1960-61 were set-aside.<br/> <br/>10. Against the said judgment and decree the respondent Nos.1 and 2 filed two Civil  Revision Nos.3466 of 1995 and 3467 of 1995 in the High Court Division and the High Court Division heard and disposed of both the Civil Revision analogously by the judgment and order dated 29.11.2006 making the Rule absolute in both the Civil Revision.<br/> <br/>11. As against the judgment and order of the High Court Division the petitioners have filed this petition for leave to appeal.<br/> <br/>12. Heard the learned Advocate-on-Record and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/> <br/>13.  It appears that the present petitioner challenged the certificate proceedings and lost up to the Land Appellate Board, the highest revenue forum. The High Court Division considered this fact and held as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"In the instant case certificate debtor Ferastulla Sarder challenged the cer­tificate proceeding and lost up to the highest revenue forum and he is now estopped from raising his grievance against the same certificate sale in the Civil Court."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>14. In view of the findings of the High Court Division that the legality of the cer­tificate proceeding settled in a revenue forum cannot be agitated before the Civil Court, is a correct finding which calls for no interference by this Court.<br/> <br/>We find no merit in these petitions which are accordingly dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
