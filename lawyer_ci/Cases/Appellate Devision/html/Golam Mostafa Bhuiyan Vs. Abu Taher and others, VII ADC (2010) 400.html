The Court of appeal below on consideration of the documentary evidence has held that it is not clear as to in which portion of plot no. 2261 the pre-emptor is in possession and that he has not specifically mentioned in the pre-emption petition in support of the claim as contiguous owner. The trial Court also found that the pre-emptor is not a contiguous owner of the lands transferred. In the leave petition also the pre-emptor has failed to take any specific ground in support of his claim as contiguous owner. The Courts below have concurrently found that the petitioner is not a tenant holding land contiguous to the lands transferred and this finding is based on proper appreciation of the evidence on record. In view of the above, the learned judge of the High Court Division is perfectly justified in affirming the judgments of the Courts below that the pre-emptor is not a tenant holding lands contiguous to the lands transferred.   … (9)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Lawyers Involved:</strong><br/><em>Abul Kalam Chowdhury</em>, Advocate instructed by A.

Petitioner instituted Miscellaneous Case No. 7 of 1999(Preemption) in the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Sadar, Noakhali for preemption of the case land claiming as co-sharer as well as holding lands contiguous to the lands transferred under section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act. Petitioner's case in short is that Rashed Miah Bhuiyan, Tanu Miah Bhuiyan, Abdur Razzaque, sons of Soa Miah Bhuiyan were the owners of lands in D.S. Khatian No. 657 corresponding to M.R.R. khatian No.729 of mouja 314 Kasherpar Senbagh, Noakhali. Preemptor being the son of Rashed Miah Bhuiyan is a co-sharer by inheritance in the lands of D.S. khatian Nos. 651 and 657 correspon­ding to M.R.R. khatian Nos. 729 and 721 respectively of plot No. 2261. The Pre-emptor-Petitioner is also holding lands contiguous south of plot No.2261 being plot No. 2326 of M.R.R. khatiankhatian No. 587 corresponding to M.R.R. khatian No. 640 by a registered deed dated 9th February, 1968 from Montaj Miah and therefore, the petitioner is also a co-sharer in the said holding. In the lands of D.S. khatian No. 657 corresponding to M.R.R. khatian No.729, D.S. khatian No. 651 correspon­ding to M.R.R. khatian No.721, D.S. khat­ian No.587 corresponding to M.R.R. khatiankhat­ian No. 657 corresponding to M.R.R. kha­tian No. 729 and D.S. khatian No. 587 at a consideration of Tk. 30,000/- to the pre-emptee-respondent by registered deed dated 1st September, 1988. The respondent no.3 Abdullah, another co-sharer sold .20½ acres of land out of D.S. khatian No. 204. Rashed Miah Bhuiyan and Abdur Razzaque Bhuiyan purchased some lands of plot No.2259 of D.S. No. 640 the petitioner is a tenant hold­ing lands contiguous to the lands of plot no. 2326. Said Abdur Razzaque Bhuiyan, the opposite party No.2 in the preemption case sold .291/2 acres of land of D.S. No.657 corresponding to M.R.R. khatian No.729 on the same date to the respondent No.1 at a consideration of Tk. 22,000/-; the respondent No. 4 Abul Kashem by regis­tered deed dated 5th September, 1998 transferred .16½ acres of land out of M.R.R. khatian No.729 at a consideration of Tk. 25,000/-to the respondent No.2 by registered deed dated 5th August, 1988. The respondents No.5 and 6 Shamsul Huq and Setara Begum sold .18½  acres of land out of lands of D.S. khatian No. 657 corre­sponding to M.R.R. khatian Nos. 729 and 204 to the respondent No.1 at a considera­tion of Tk. 20,000/- by registered deed dated 3rd September, 1988. The respon­dents with a malafide motive to defeat the right of preemption mentioned the deeds as deeds of exchange but in fact by these deeds the respondents No. 2-6 sold the case lands to the respondent No.1. The respondent No. 3 executed deed no. 5254 in favour of the respondent No.1. The respon­dent No. 5 executed deed No. 5297 in favour of the respondent No.1; and the respondent No.2 executed deed No. 5251 in favour of respondent No.6; the respondent No.4 created deed No. 4786 in favour of respondent No.7, the brother-in-law of the respondent No.1; the respondent No.1 also created deeds No.5460 and 5502 for the same land through the respondent No.7. These deeds were created within a space of 15 days with a view to defeat the right of preemption.<br/> <br/>3. The respondent No.1 contested the case by filing a written objection. His case is that the preemption case is not legally maintainable, inasmuch as, the deeds in question being deeds of exchange, the lands covered with the deeds are not pre-­emptible. His further case is that the respondent No.2 to 6 sold lands to the respondent No.7 who in turn transferred the same to the respondent No.1 and these deeds being separate transactions can not be claimed for preemption in the same case. He further claimed that he improved the case land by constructing houses and the case is, therefore, liable to be dis­missed.<br/> <br/>4. The learned Assistant Judge upon hear­ing the parties by judgment and order dated 8th November, 2003 allowed the preemption in part in respect of .33 acres of land of S.A. plot no. 2261 of S.A. khatian No. 729. Holding that the deeds are out and out sale and that the petitioner is a co-sharer in M.R.R. khatian No.729 of plot No.2261. The learned Assistant Judge also noticed that on the same date of execution of the deed of exchange, the respondent Nos. 2-6 transferred the said lands to the respondent No. 7 and thereafter the respon­dent No.7 again transferred the same land to the respondent No.1 and these transactions sufficiently indicated that these deeds were created with a view to deprive the right of preemption and that these deeds were colorable deeds. The learned Assistant Judge however rejected the peti­tioner's claim of pre-emption as contigu­ous owner of plot No. 2261 with his plot No. 2326.<br/> <br/>5. Being aggrieved by the said judgment and order, the petitioner filed Miscellaneous Appeal No. 89 of 2003 and the respondent No.1 preferred Miscellaneous Appeal No. 83 of 2003 before the learned District Judge, Noakhali. The learned Joint District Judge, Artha Rin Adalat, Noakhali heard both the appeals analogously and by judg­ment and order dated 24th January 2005 allowed Miscellaneous Appeal No. 83 of 2003 and set aside the judgment of the learned Assistant Judge and allowed pre­emption in part in respect of .23 acres of land of plot No.2261 of D.S. Khatian No. 657 corresponding to S.A. Khatian No.721; .14 acres of land of plot No. 2261 of D.S. khatian No. 657 and .6 ½ acres of land of plot No.2259 of D.S. Khatian No.587 cor­responding to S.A. khatian No. 640. The learned Joint District Judge, however, set aside the judgment of the learned Assistant Judge allowing preemption in respect of .33 acres of land of plot No. 2261 of S.A. khatian No. 729.<br/> <br/>6. The respondent No.1 moved this Court in Civil Revision No. 2334 of 2005 against the judgment and order passed in Miscellaneous Appeal No.89 of 2003 allowing preemption in respect of .43 ½ acres of land. The petitioner also moved Civil Revision No. 1350 of 2005 against the judgment and order passed in Miscellaneous Appeal No.83 of 2003 by which judgment, the learned Joint District Judge set aside the judgment and order of the learned Assistant Judge allowing pre­emption in respect of .33 acres of land of plot No.2261. The petitioner also pre­ferred Civil Revision No. 1417 of 2005 against the judgment and order passed in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 89 of 2003 dis­missing the petitioner's claim of preemp­tion in respect of .41½ acres of land as co-sharer tenant and tenant holding land con­tiguous to the lands transferred. A Single Bench of the High Court Division heard all these revision petitions analogously and by judgment and order dated 21st May, 2008 made the rule in Civil Revision No. 2334 of 2005 absolute and discharged other rules without, however, making any order in the operating portion of the judgment as to whether the pre-emptor's claim for preemption was allowed or dismissed. It may be presumed that the High Court Division set aside the judgment of the lower appellate Court allowing pre-emption in respect of .41½ acres of land as co-sharer. The High Court Division held that partial preemption of a holding allowed by the Court of appeal below is not permissible in law, that a transfer of land by way of exchange is not pre-emptible and that the preemptor-petitioner is not the tenant holding lands con­tiguous to the lands transferred.<br/> <br/>7. Mr. Abul Kalam Chowdhury learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner sub­mits that the learned Judge of the High Court Division erred in law in not interfer­ing with the judgment of the learned Subordinate Judge in failing to consider that the pre-emptor is a contiguous owner of plot No. 2326 with plot No. 2261. It is argued that the Courts below failed to consider the admission of O.P.W.No.2 Zainal Abedin that the pre-emptor is a contiguous owner of plots No. 2261 and 2326 and that P.W.2 corroborated him.<br/> <br/>8. Mr. M. A. Samad, learned Counsel enter­ing caveat, however supports the judg­ment of the High Court Division and sub­mits that the Courts below concurrently found that the petitioner is not a tenant holding lands contiguous to the lands transferred.<br/> <br/>9. I have perused the judgment of the High Court Division and those of the Courts below and heard the learned Counsels. The Court of appeal below on considera­tion of the documentary evidence has held that it is not clear as to in which portion of plot No.2261 the pre-emptor is in posses­sion and that he has not specifically men­tioned in the pre-emption petition in support of the claim as contiguous owner. The trial Court also found that the pre-emptor is not a contiguous owner of the lands transferred. In the leave petition also the pre-emptor has failed to take any specific ground in support of his claim as contigu­ous owner. The Courts below have con­currently found that the petitioner is not a tenant holding lands contiguous to the lands transferred and this finding is based on proper appreciation of the evidence on record. In view of the above, the learned Judge of the High Court Division is per­fectly justified in affirming the judgments of the Courts below that the pre-emptor is not a tenant holding lands contiguous to the lands transferred.<br/> <br/>I find no merit in this petition. This Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1442 of 2008 is therefore dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></span></div></div></div>
