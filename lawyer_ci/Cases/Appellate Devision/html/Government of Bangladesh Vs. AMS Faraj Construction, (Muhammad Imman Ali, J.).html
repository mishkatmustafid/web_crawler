Faruk Islam Bhuiyan. The Chisty Textile Mills Limited, Doulatpur, Cumilla (the Mill) was established as a private industry in 1962 which was incorporated under the Companies Act, 1913. After the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, along with other textile and jute mills of the country, the Mill was also nationalised and was taken over pursuant to President’s Order No.27 of 1972 and was vested upon Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation (BTMC) for its maintenance, management and improvement. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Subsequently, as continuous loss was being incurred by the Mill, the Government closed down the operation of the Mill from the month of June in 1998. Thereafter, with the intention of privatising the Mill through the Privatisation Commission, the Government invited international tender. However, even after inviting international tender four times, the Mill was not sold for different reasons. Pursuant to the decision of the Bangladesh Government and by virtue of article 23(2) of the President’s Order No.27 of 1972 read with Order dated 01.11.2003 of the Ministry of Textiles and Jute, the Mill was declared to be wound up with effect from 09.11.2003. Accordingly, writ-respondent No.2 was appointed as the Liquidator for the Mill to take all actions required to be taken and all responsibilities required to be discharged in this regard vide Memo dated 13.11.2003. According to the letter dated 02.08.2003 signed by the Senior Assistant Secretary and the circular from the Cabinet Division, it was stated that all actions required to be taken and all responsibilities required to sell or discharge the Mill would also be monitored by the Ministry of Industry. The writ-petitioner vide different applications made to writ-respondent No.2 expressed its intention of purchasing the Mill. In response to the said applications, writ-respondent No.2 informed the writ-petitioner that a land dispute existed and only after disposal of the case regarding the land dispute and after review and assessing the valuation of all the movable and immovable properties, inventories and liabilities of the Mill by a CA firm, a tender should be floated to that effect. Subsequently, a CA firm was appointed in this regard which analysed and decided that the value of the assets of the Mill was taka 15.11 crore and liabilities were 44.56 crore. The writ-petitioner being aware of such valuation again expressed its intention to purchase the Mill. However, when the file was presented for approval before the Minister of the Ministry of Textiles and Jute, he declined to approve it and decided that the Mill would be sold at taka 35 crore in the meeting dated 04.07.2013, which was evident from the minutes of the meeting bearing reference dated 10.07.2013. The writ-petitioner was informed about the decision of the Minister vide letter dated 14.08.2013. Due to the subsisting recession at that time, the writ-petitioner was unable to pay the entire amount at once. Hence the writ-petitioner made a number of applications for paying the purchase price of taka 35 crore by making a down payment of taka 15 crore and paying the rest of taka 20 crore in instalments. The application was allowed and accordingly, the writ-petitioner vide pay order Nos.0000061 and 0847087 dated 13.11.2013 paid a total of taka 15 crore to writ-respondent No.2 which was duly received by him. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Thereafter, writ-respondent No.2 and the writ-petitioner entered into a deed of agreement for sale dated 01.01.2014 for sale of the movable and immovable assets of the non-operative Chisty Textile Mills Limited wherein it had been specifically agreed by the parties that upon payment by the writ-petitioner of the remaining balance of taka 20 crore in 5(five) equal instalments within 10 (ten) months from the date of the agreement, writ-respondent No.2 would have the legal obligation to execute and register necessary sale deed in favour of the writ-petitioner in order to transfer the ownership of Chisty Textile Mills Limited along with all its movable and immovable proprieties.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">5.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">In accordance with clause 3 of the agreement, the possession of the Mill was transferred and handed over to the writ-petitioner vide letter dated 06.01.2014 and subsequently, the writ-petitioner acknowledged the delivery of the possession of the Mills on 07.01.2014 vide Memo dated 09.01.2014.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">6.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">All of a sudden, writ-respondent No.2 issued a Memo dated 18.02.2014 restraining the writ-petitioner from carrying out any activity in relation to Chisty Textile Mills Limited until further instruction.

It was further submitted that</span><span class="FontStyle11"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Book Antiqua';"> the decision of the Bangladesh Government by virtue of Article 23 (2) of the President Order 27 of 1972 was that with order dated 01.11.2003 of the Ministry of Textiles and Jute, the Mill in question was declared to be wound up with effect from 09.11.2003. Accordingly, on 13.11.2003 liquidator was appointed who disposed of the Mill in favour of the writ-petitioner in a transparent way, and before that 2 times the matter was put in auction, but competent bidder was not found and continuous loss was being incurred from the Mill. Subsequently, the writ-petitioner purchased the Mill at the highest rate of Tk. 35 crore. It was further submitted that the contract dated 01.01.2014 was confirmed in between the parties and part consideration was paid and the writ petitioner did not breach any condition of contract for sale so, the seller has no option to go beyond the agreement for sale and the Ministry of Textile and Jute has legal obligation to perform its part of the contract. The price settled at Tk. 35 crore is proper value of the property in question and part consideration money was received without any objection so, the appellants subsequently cannot refuse to perform their part of the contract which is illegal. It was also submitted that the appellants have most arbitrarily, illegally and with <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">mala fide</em> intention restrained the respondents from carrying on any activity in relation to the Mill although the respondent <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">has lawful possession in the same in accordance</span> with the agreement. It was submitted that the appellants restrained the respondents from carrying out any activity in relation to the Mill without giving opportunity to be heard and as such, the actions of the appellants have violated the principle of natural justice. The appellant's action in restraining the writ-petitioner from carrying on any activity related to the Mill and their deliberate failure to receive installment for the balance amount from the respondents and execute and register necessary sale deed in favour of them in compliance with the terms of the Agreement have clearly infringed the writ-petitioner's fundamental right to property guaranteed and protected under Article 42 of Part III of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh and as such, direction upon the appellants to allow the respondents to resume all activities in relation to the Mill and also to receive the installment for the balance amount from the writ-petitioner-respondent and to execute and register necessary sale deed in order to transfer the ownership of the Mill along with all its movable and immovable properties in compliance with the terms of the agreement is justified. The respondents have the fundamental right to indiscriminately enjoy the protection of law and to be treated in accordance with law, and therefore the <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">action of the appellant in restraining the respondent</span> from carrying on any activity related to the Mill is clearly detrimental. The respondent have throughout complied with the terms of the agreement and made every effort to perform the agreement by trying to pay the balance amount of the purchase price which was not accepted without objection. It was submitted that legitimate expectation has been developed when the possession of the Mill was transferred in accordance with the agreement. After the appellants restrained the petitioner from carrying on any activity in relation to the Mill, the respondents received the 1st and 2nd installments from the respondent under the agreement and therefore, the respondents further legitimately expressed that the restraining order of the appellants has no legal force in the eye of law.

But these do not include selling the property under liquidation by any means other than through tender. Moreover we note that the Liquidation Cell had already been abolished in the meantime and was not in existence at the time of the Deed of Agreement. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">22.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The fact that the writ-petitioner was in default in paying his instalments in accordance with the terms of the Agreement is a secondary issue.

However, we are of the view that the Agreement entered into by the writ-petitioner had no legal basis. Hence, there was no question of any right accruing in favour of the writ-petitioner. We <span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt;">say so, firstly because the Liquidator apparently</span> did not exist at that time. Secondly, his power with regard to the Mill was only to the extent of selling the same through tender and not by any agreement.

In this regard we may refer to the decision in the case of <strong><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Sharping Matshajibi Samabaya Samity Ltd Vs. Bangladesh and ors.</em></strong> reported in 39 DLR(AD)85. In that case Badrul Haider Chowdhury, J as his Lordship was then, observed as follows:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt 9pt; line-height: 112%; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">      </span>“Modern Government has multifarious activities. Some of its functions are Governmental function while exercising sovereign power and again some of the functions can be described as trading function.” His Lordship went on to say that “when the Government grants lease, privilege, settlement, etc., the Government acts and discharges sovereign function ‘performing function in connection with affairs of the republic or the local authority”. His Lordship observed that the Government acts in these affairs in pursuance of some statutory power and any such contract when rooted in statute, the Government discharges its sovereign functions. In the instant case the learned Advocate for the respondents submitted that the sale of the property having taken place in furtherance of authority provided in President’s Order 27 of 1972, the contract for sale was a statutory contract. In this context we may profitably refer to the decision in the case of <strong><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Bangladesh Power Development Board and others vs Md. Asaduzzaman Sikder</em></strong> reported in <strong><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">9 BLC (AD) 1,</em></strong> where it was argued that the contract entered into by virtue of section 17(2)(a) of P.O.59 of 1972 rendered it as a statutory contract. However, their Lordships expressed the opinion that “The contract which the Board may enter into as per the aforesaid provision is an enacting or enabling provision in the execution of its works, like the work as was undertaken upon entering into contract with the respondent. The contract that was entered into by the appellants with the respondent was not in terms of statutory provision or in exercise of statutory power but the contract so entered into was an ordinary commercial contract or contract of general nature or, in other words, a pure and simple contract.” Their Lordships concluded that the relief sought for and granted by the High Court Division was not legally available to the respondent. With respect, we are of the view that in the facts of the instant case the contract entered into by the Official Liquidator is not a statutory contract, apart from the fact that, as we have noted above, the post of the liquidator had been abolished and in any event the liquidator was authorised to sell the property in question through tender.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 6pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">25.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">In the later case of <strong><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Superintendent Engineer, RHD Sylhet and others v.
