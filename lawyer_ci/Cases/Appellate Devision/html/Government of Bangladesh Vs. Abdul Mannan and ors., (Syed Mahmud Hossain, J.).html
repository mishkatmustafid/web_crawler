The fact of oral gift was affirmed by an affidavit dated 13.10.1971. Mr. Fazle Dossani’s wife Mrs. Gulbanu Dossani entered into an agreement with the writ petitioner and his brother to transfer the property in question and received an amount of Tk.15,000/- as earnest money and thereupon executed a deed of agreement on 24.02.1971. On 28.02.1972, Gulbanu received a further amount of Tk.1,00,000/-(one lac) from the writ petitioner and his brother towards the part payment of the consideration money which was fixed at Tk.2,00,000/-(two lac). But document having not been executed and registered the writ petitioner and his brother filed Title Suit No.15 of 1972 and obtained an <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ex parte</em> decree and in execution thereof obtained the deed of sale through Court.

In order to prove the oral gift, the writ-petitioner filed an affidavit sworn by Mr. Dossani on 13.10.1971 (Annexure-D to the writ petition). Having gone through the affidavit, we find that this affidavit was sworn before a Magistrate at Karachi, Pakistan then an enemy country at war with Bangladesh. There is no explanation for the long gap of 9 years between the alleged oral gift and the affidavit. Although the affidavit mentioned possession of Mrs. Gulbanu in the property, there is no paper such as receipts showing payment of various taxes, ground rents, etc. by her to the tax receiving authorities during the said long period of 9 years. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">21.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">What is remarkable to note here is that there is no paper showing mutation/substitution of Mrs. Gulbanu’s name in place of Mr. Dossani with the DIT (Dhaka Improvement Trust) or Ministry of Works, or Income Tax Authority, etc. to prove Mrs. Gulbanu’s exclusive possession of the case property. Therefore, the Court of Settlement did not give importance to the affidavit sworn in an enemy country and at the time of swearing the affidavit liberation war was going on in this country. What is important to note here is that the so-called affidavit was sworn in 8 months after the deed of agreement of sale of the writ-petitioner. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">22.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">Admittedly, the deed of agreement dated 24.02.1971 is an unregistered agreement and there is no explanation why it was not registered.

The Court of Settlement further held that if the payment of Tk.100,000/- was made on 28.02.1972 why no document was obtained from Mrs. Gulbanu as a proof of the payment. But before the High Court Division the writ petitioner produced a receipt (Annexure-C) showing payment of Tk.100,000/- to Mrs. Gulbanu on 28.02.1971. From the judgment of the Court of Settlement, it appears that the receipt (Annexure-C) showing payment of Tk.100000/- was not produced before it. Had Annexure-C been produced before the Court of Settlement, it would have been considered by it. Such apparent contradiction in payment of Tk.100,000/- also belies the claim of the writ-petitioner. The Court of Settlement also noted that Mrs. Gulbanu’s address was given as Gulistan building which was not her residential quarter. The Court of Settlement also noticed that summons on Gulbanu in the suit record showed that it was served upon one Saifur Ahmed and there was nothing in the Peon’s report clarifying as to who this Saifur Ahmed was and whether he was at all authorized to receive summons on Gulbanu’s behalf. Therefore, the Court of Settlement came to the finding that the address of Gulbanu as shown in the plaint of Title Suit No.15 of 1972 was false and no summons of the suit was served upon her and that the affidavit dated 13.10.1971 sworn at Karachi, Pakistan, proved that Mrs. Gulbanu was not residing in this country in 1971 or 1972 at all. In view of the aforesaid finding of the Court of Settlement, we are of the opinion that <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ex parte</em> decree was obtained by practicing fraud upon the Court and as such, the decree did not prove the writ-petitioner’s claim over the property.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">25.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">The <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ex parte</em> decree passed in Title Suit No.15 of 1972 of the Third Court of the then Subordinate Judge has been annexed as Annexure-H to the writ petition.

The Court of Settlement also noted that there were other letters in the Ministry’s file issued by Mr. Rashid and those letters bore his signatures in Bengali but in this particular letter the signature is in English, the letter being the only exception in the entire case file to bear an English signature in the midst of Bengali signatures of other Officers as well. Therefore, the Certificate and the letter are documents fabricated by the writ-petitioner for creating evidence in his favour.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">33.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">By the note verbal dated 26.12.1979 (Annexure-N to the writ petition), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Bangladesh, informed the Indian High Commission that the case property in the High Commission’s possession “as an abandoned property” has been released in favour of Mr. Abdul Mannan and Abdul Hannan.
