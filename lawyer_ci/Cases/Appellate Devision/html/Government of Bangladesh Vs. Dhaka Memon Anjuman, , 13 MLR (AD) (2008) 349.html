The writ-petitioner is found to be the owner and possessor of the disputed property. The impugned enemy property case was started in 1997 by colourable exercise of power by the respondent which being grossly illegal and malafide cannot be sustained in law and as such the High Court Division declared the same illegal and of no legal effect which the Appellate Division upheld. </strong><br/> <br/><strong>It is evident from the documents available on record that the Government made several enquiries into the matter by its officers and their reports supported the writ-petitioners' case inspite of the fact that the writ-respondents refrained from taking action against the illegal occupants, police personnel for evict ion from the case property. The High Court Division, in view of the matter, held that the inactions of the writ-respondents tantamount to abetment to such unauthorized possession of the case property by the illegal occupants; that alleged enlistment, if any, of the case property in 1997 as vested property by the writ-respondents is a clear violation of the provisions of law and colourful exercise of power. It is evident that the V.P. case in question was started in 1997 and before that time there was no occasion to treat the case property as a vested property. In the absence of any legal basis the exercise of powers by the writ-respondents to treat the case property as vested property in 1997 does not only tantamount to illegal exercise of power by colourable assumption of law but also amounts to total disregard shown to the rights of the writ-petitioner which is obviously malafide and without jurisdiction. …. (7)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>It will not be out of place to mention here that this Court consistently declared the enlistment of enemy property' after 1974 as vested property as illegal and without lawful authority as the law of enemy property became inoperative and no property could be declared as enemy property after the repeal of Ordinance No. 1 of 1965 on 23.03.1974, reference in this regard may be had to the cases reported in 32 DLR (AD) 70 and 186. … (9)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Case Referred to-</strong><br/>32 DLR (AD) 70 and 186.<br/> <br/><strong>Lawyers Involved: </strong><br/>Nurul Islam Bhuiyan, Advocate-on-Record-For the Petitioners.<br/>A.

Lalbagh in the City of Dhaka from the list of vested property which was included by the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Dhaka and as such, listing the property on 05.03.1997 as illegal, without any lawful authority and directing to restore vacant possession thereof to writ petitioner within 30 days from the date of receipt of the copy of the judgment.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong> The facts of the case, in short, are that the writ-petitioner, Dhaka Memon Anjuman, is a charitable organization and run for charitable purposes including making provision for education and financial assistance to the poor. The writ-petitioner purchased the case land including buildings thereon by a registered deed dated 05.12.1962 from Kazi Paziruddin Ahmed and others who became owners of the case property through a registered exchange deed dated 06.04.1962 from Chinmoyee Debi and Shanty Bhusan Banarjee. The Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) gave permission for the said exchange deed vide Misc. Case No. 58 of 1961-62, the photocopy of both the deeds have been marked as Annexure-A and A1. Both the C. S. and S. A. Khatians in respect of the case property were duly prepared recording in the name of Chinmoyee Debi and Shanti Bhusan Banarjee and after purchase of the case land it was duly prepared and recorded in the name of writ-petitioner in R.S. Khatian. The writ-petitioner on the request of high-ranking police officers allowed for setting up of a temporary police camp in some portion of the house in 1987 in order to maintain peace in the locality. But unfortunately and without any lawful and valid authority the police personnel started living therein and occupied the house without any agreement with the writ-petitioner. Thereafter, the President and Secretary of the Dhaka Memon Anjuman executed a general power of attorney on 20.04.2004 appointing Khawaja Mohammad Akbar to do all acts on behalf of the writ-petitioner which is marked as Annexure-E to the writ-petition. The said attorney by a prayer in writing dated 22.02.2003 requested the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs and Inspector General of Police for restoration of vacant possession of the house by removing police personnel living therein. Consequently, upon the said prayer, the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Dhaka (South) directed the officer-in-charge, Police Station Kotwali, DMP, to make an enquiry into the matter and after due enquiry he submitted detailed report on 12.06.2004 stating that the writ-petitioner is the owner and possessor of the case property but several police personnel are staying therein without authority, therefore, steps should be taken for their, eviction and restoration of possession in favour of the writ-petitioner. That the building of the writ-petitioner is very old and likely to collapse at any moment, moreover, at present there is no justification for their stay in that house. Inspire. of such report the police authority did not take step for eviction of those illegal occupants. Ministry of Home Affairs, consequently through one Deputy Police Commissioner made another enquiry into the matter and submitted a report stating that illegal occupant police personnel should be evicted therefrom and its vacant possession to be handed over to the writ-petitioner which are marked as Annexure-F and Fl to the writ-petition.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> The writ-petitioners suddenly came to know that some police personnel applied to the Deputy Commissioner (Rev), Dhaka for taking lease of the case property, consequently, writ-respondent No.3, ADC (Rev), started V.P. Case No.6 of 1983 and sent it to the Ministry of Land for its approval. It is remarkable to note that the case property was neither listed in the vested property published by the Government nor it was acquired by the Government at any time which is marked as Annexure-G to the writ-petition. The attorney of the writ-petitioner made a prayer requesting writ-respondent No.1 to release the property from the list of vested property; consequently writ-respondent No.1 obtained legal opinion from the law officer who gave report with a comment that there was no scope to enlist any property a vested property in the year of 1997 by the ADC (Rev), Dhaka. The writ-petitioner again made an application to the Secretary, Ministry of Land to release the property from the list of vested property. On being directed the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka submitted detailed report on 21.04.2005 to the Ministry of Land which are marked as Annexures-H, H1 and H2 to the writ-petition.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> Inspite of aforesaid reports and recommendations, the writ-respondents did not pay heed to the prayers of the writ-petitioner. The writ-respondents in violations of law most illegally retained the property of the writ-petitioner. The unauthorized retention of the property and enlistment of the same as vested property by the writ-respondents are liable to be declared illegal and without lawful authority. It is further stated that the writ-respondents should be directed to hand over possession of the property to the writ-petitioner forthwith.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> Mr. Nurul Islam Bhuiyan, learned Advocate-on-Record, appearing for the petitioner submitted that the High Court Division committed an error making the Rule absolute in Writ Petition No. 8891 of 2005 directing the writ-respondents to release the case property from the list of vested property and restore vacant possession thereof to the writ-petitioner within 30 days from the date of receipt of copy of the impugned judgment without considering the evidence on record in its true perspective; that the property is admittedly owned by the Hindu owners and their names are recorded in C.S. and S.A. Porcha, namely Chinmoyee Debi and Shanti Bhusan Banarjee who have admittedly migrated to India and the writ-petitioner had never been in possession of the suit property and as such, the same is a vested property.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> It appears from the record that Chinmoyee and Shanti Bhusan obtained permission from proper authority for exchange of the case land with Kazi Paziruddin on 06.04.1962 and that Paziruddin and others who subsequently sold the same to the writ-petitioner on 05.12.1962. It also appears from the record that both the C.S. and S.A. Khatians were duly recorded in the names of Chinmoyee and Shanti   Bhusan Banarjee and R.S. Khatian was also duly recorded in the name of the writ-petitioner. It also revealed from Annexures-F, F1, H, H1 that the writ-petitioner filed several applications to the Secretary of the concerned Ministry and Inspector General of Police and consequent upon the said prayers, police officers made enquiry into the matter and submitted report stating that the writ-petitioner is the owner of the case property and the illegal occupant police personnel should be evicted but the writ-respondents have not yet taken any step pursuant to those enquiry reports. It appears from the list of vested property of Kotwali Police Station, Dhaka (Annexure-G) that the property in question was not included in the list as vested property.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>  It is evident from the documents available on record that the Government made several enquiries into the matter by its officers and their reports supported the writ-petitioners' case inspite of the fact that the writ-respondents refrained from taking action against the illegal occupants, police personnel for evict ion from the case property. The High Court Division, in view of the matter, held that the inactions of the writ-respondents tantamount to abetment to such unauthorized possession of the case property by the illegal occupants; that alleged enlistment, if any, of the case property in 1997 as vested property by the writ-respondents is a clear violation of the provisions of law and colourful exercise of power. It is evident that the V.P. case in question was started in 1997 and before that time there was no occasion to treat the case property as a vested property. In the absence of any legal basis the exercise of powers by the writ-respondents to treat the case property as vested property in 1997 does not only tantamount to illegal exercise of power by colourable assumption of law but also amounts to total disregard shown to the rights of the writ-petitioner which is obviously malafide and without jurisdiction.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> The High Court Division further held that the writ-respondents in violation of the provision of law most illegally enlisted the property in 1997 as vested property and failed to take proper action under the law to restore possession thereof to the writ-petitioner.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>  It will not be out of place to mention here that this Court consistently declared the enlistment of enemy property' after 1974 as vested property as illegal and without lawful authority as the law of enemy property became inoperative and no property could be declared as enemy property after the repeal of Ordinance No. 1 of 1965 on 23.03.1974, reference in this regard may be had to the cases reported in 32 DLR (AD) 70 and 186.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong> In view of the above, we find no substance in the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
