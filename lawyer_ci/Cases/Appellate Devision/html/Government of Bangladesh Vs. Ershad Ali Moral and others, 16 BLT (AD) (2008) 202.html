Ruhul Amin J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This appeal, by leave, is against the judgment and order dated March 27, 1997 of a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.7646 of 1991 making the Rule absolute upon setting aside the judgment and decree dated February 19, 1991 of the Court of District Judge, Jessore, in Title Appeal No. 92 of 1987 allowing the appeal and thereupon dismissing the suit. The appeal was filed against the judgment and decree dated September 2, 1985 of the Court of Munsif (now Assistant Judge), Monirampur Upazilla, Jessore, passed in Title Suit No. 19 of 1984 decreeing the same. The suit was filed for declaration of title and for confirmation of possession in the land described in the schedule.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong>  The plaintiff-Respondent Nos.1-10 filed the suit stating, inter alia, that the land in suit measuring 4.08 acres of C.S. Khatian No.876 corresponding to S.A. Khatian No.1 of Mouza Machna belonged-to Dhirendra Nath Roy, Zarmindar of Narail Zamindari Estate, that the Zamindar orally settled the land to the plaintiffs on 20th Poush, 1354 B.S. and since then plaintiffs are in possession of the land in suit. It was also the case  of the plaintiffs that the defendant Nos.2 and 3 claimed title in the land in suit in the month of Bhadra, 1383 B.S. disclosing that they have taken settlement from the Government and then on enquiry plaintiffs came to know from the local thasil office that the land in suit has been incorrectly recorded in S.A. Khatian in the name of the Government and the said wrong recording having had clouted plaintiffs' title they were constrained to file the suit seeking declaration  of  title and confirmation of possession.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> The suit was contested by the defendant No.1, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh by filing written statement denying the material averments made in the plaint and stating, inter alia, that the land in suit was non-retainable khas land of the Zamindar and that the land in suit with other non-retainable lands of the Zamindar vested with the Government as per provision of section 20(2) of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 and that during S. A. survey operation the land was correctly recorded in the khas khatian No.1 in the name of the Government and that the Government has given permanent lease to different persons on different dates and the lessees are in possession of the land in suit. It was also the case of the contesting defendant that the plaintiffs by creating forged and ante-dated documents want to grab the land in suit.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> The trial Court on consideration of the evidence brought on record by the parties decreed the suit on the finding that though the plaintiffs failed to produce documentary evidence in support of their claim in respect of the land in suit but they are in possession of the land in suit and that although the defendant claimed that the land in suit has been settled to different persons and the lessees of the defendant are in possession but the defendant failed to produce evidence before the Court in support of the said claim and that from the evidence of the plaintiffs' witnesses it is seen that the plaintiffs have been able to prove their case.<br/> <br/>It may be mentioned that discussion of the evidence made by the trial Court is not of the kind as ought to have been by the first Court of fact.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> The contesting defendant went on appeal. The appellate Court noticed that the contesting defendant in support of its claim that the land in suit was the non-retainable land of the Zamindar and the same was acquired as per provision of section 20 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act did not file any paper relating to preparation of compensation assessment roll and compensation, if any, paid to the   ex-Zamindar or that compensation was assessed but the Zamindar did not withdraw the same inspite of being ready for payment and thereupon observed "In the absence of the same it is very much hard to believe the defence contention that the suit lands have been duly acquired by the Government under section 20(2) of the S.A. &amp; T. Act, as non-retainable khas properties of the admitted ex-Zamindar". The appellate Court also observed that although contesting defendant claimed that the land in suit has been leased out by the Government and the same is possessed by the lessees on the basis of the registered kabuliyat which were produced before the trial Court and were marked as Exts. but later on the same were taken back and were not produced before the appellate Court and as such adverse presumption in the light of the provision of section 114(h) of the Evidence Act can very much be drawn as to the genuineness of the said documents and the lessees, as claimed by the defendant, are not witness in the case in support of the claim of the defendant that the lessees are in. possession of the land in suit. In the background of the aforesaid observations the appellate Court held "the Government has failed to prove that the suit lands were non-retainable khas lands of the ex-Zamindar of Narail and Government acquired the same under section 20(2) of the S.A. &amp; T. Act and since then it has been possessing through its lessees".<br/> <br/>The appellate Court after making the aforesaid finding and decision considered the case of the plaintiffs and observed "So the story of pattan found to have not been proved beyond reasonable doubt".<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> The P.W.1, one of the plaintiffs, while deposing in support of plaintiffs' claim of taking settlement of the land in suit stated that at the time of taking pattan Mongal Gazi, Syad Ali, Shahadat, Obaidullah and Hossain Sardar were present but the plaintiffs for the purpose of corroborating P.W.1 so far his evidence relating to pattan did not examine none of the persons claimed to have been present at the time of pattan but examined P.Ws.2 and 3 who were not the persons, as mentioned by P.W.1, present at the time of pattan. It may also be mentioned no explanation was offered by the plaintiffs for non-examination of the persons who, as claimed by the P.W.1, were present at the time of pattan. The appellate Court in the afore state of the matter placed no reliance on the P.Ws.2 and 3 who were examined to corroborate the P.W.1 as regard the matter of pattan.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> It was the case of the plaintiffs that talk of the pattan took place with the Manager of the Zamindar. In that background the appellate Court observed that no material was brought on record to show that the Manager of the ex-Zamindar was competent to settle the land and that no material was also brought on record, that at the time of talk of pattan Zamindar was present or consented to the pattan or received the salami. The appellate Court also noticed that dakhilas produced by the plaintiffs in support of their case of taking pattan of the land in suit do not bear the signature of the Manager who, as claimed by the plaintiffs settled the land, that the scribe of the dakhilas i.e. Naib of the ex-Zamindar was not examined and for such nonexamination no explanation was offered. On examination and scrutiny of the dakhilas the appellate Court arrived at the finding "The dakhilas Ext. 1 series found to have been made old by artificial means and the close scrutiny of the same clearly indicates that the same were written in one sitting by an in-experienced hand .........The Ext.1  series in no way inspire confidence about its age as shown thereto", and the claim of the P.Ws.2 and 3 of their being present at the time of pattan can not be accepted since P.W. 1 has not stated about the presence of the said witnesses at the time of taking pattan by the plaintiffs and that the said witnesses "failed to prove the particulars of the dakhilas Ext.1 series". In the afore state of the matter the appellate Court arrived at the finding "I do not find any reason to believe that they (P.Ws.2-3) were present at the time of granting the dakhilas Ext. 1 series or their presence at the time of alleged pattan or that the same i.e. pattan had actually taken place. The dakhilas Ext. 1 series filed by the plaintiffs also do not create much confidence. Regard being had to the above facts and circumstances, I am constrained to hold that the story of pattan is a mere myth and the dakhilas Ext. 1 series are mere paper transaction and no reliance can be reposed on them. The evidence of possession of the plaintiffs is also found unsatisfactory". Plaintiffs other then P.W. 1 examined P.Ws. 2 and 3 to prove their claim of possession in the land in suit. The appellate Court on consideration of the evidence of the said witnesses (P.Ws.2 and 3) arrived at the finding that evidence on record clearly shows that the said P.Ws. do not know the suit land. The appellate Court on consideration of the evidence produced by the plaintiffs in support of their claim of taking pattan of the land in suit has observed "..........the facts and circumstances so discussed above clearly indicates that the story of pattan of the plaintiffs is not true and the papers (Ext.1 series) so filed on this behalf are found nothing but forged, collusive, antedated and created for the purpose of this suit". The appellate Court has held that the plaintiffs have not acquired title in the land in suit by lapse of time since they had no case in their pleading as regard acquiring title by lapse of time and that no evidence was also led from the plaintiffs' side as regard the case of acquiring title of the land in suit by lapse of time. On the aforesaid findings and decision the appellate Court allowed the appeal and thereupon setting aside the judgment and decree of the trial Court dismissed the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> The plaintiffs moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained Rule. The High Court Division made the Rule absolute upon observing that the plaintiffs in support of their case of taking settlement of the land in suit produced the rent receipts Ext.1 series and has proved possession in the land in suit and the Government in support of its case that its lessees are in possession of the land in suit did not examine any one of the lessees and the Government in support of its case that the land in suit being the non-retainable land of the Zamindar was acquired by the Government did not produce the compensation assessment roll.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong> The High Court Division while making the Rule absolute placed reliance on some of the observations as to the case of the respective parties made by the appellate Court and in the background of the said observations, as stated hereinbefore, the High Court Division held that the appellate Court was in error in reversing the judgment of the trial Court. As to the genuineness of the Ext.1 series the High Court Division has observed<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"The trial Court found the rent receipts, Ext.1 series, to be genuine. I myself also examined the rent receipts which is in a printed form and same appears to be genuine". On the point as regard the question of possession of the parties in the land in suit the High Court Division has observed that the Government failed to prove their possession by producing their lessees and thereupon observed "Thus I find that the trial Court has rightly decreed the suit".</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>10.</strong> Leave was granted to consider the submissions that the High Court Division was in error in setting aside the finding of fact arrived at by the Court of appeal below which is the final Court of fact upon shifting the onus on the defendants and that in the absence of legal infirmity in the finding of fact arrived at by the Court of appeal below in respect of settlement and possession High Court Division exceeded its jurisdiction under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure in making the Rule absolute and setting aside the judgment of the Court of appeal below.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong> It is seen from the judgment of the High Court Division that the said Division was of the view that the trial Court discussed the evidence while decreeing the suit "but the appellate Court did not properly discussed witness".<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong> On our perusal of the judgment of the trial Court, as has already been observed hereinbefore, that the said Court as the initial Court of fact in fact did not discuss the evidence as the law enjoins.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong> The appellate Court while reversing the judgment of the trial Court has rejected the evidence of P.Ws. 2 and 3 who were examined from the side of the plaintiffs to corroborate the P.W.1 as regard the case of taking pattan of the land from the Ex-Zamindar since the said P.Ws. were not the persons whom the P.W.1 stated were present at the time of pattan. The High Court Division while making the Rule absolute did not reverse the reasoning and the finding given by the appellate Court   in rejecting the evidence of P.Ws.2 and 3.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong> The law is well settled that the extent of jurisdiction of the revisional Court is limited. The revisional Court is within its jurisdiction in reversing the judgment of the lower Court if the same is the result of misreading of the evidence or has been made leaving the legal evidence out of consideration or that while arriving at the decision misconstrued the documentary evidence or left the vital evidence out of consideration without assigning any reason. If the judgment of the lower Court does not suffer from any one of the aforesaid defects the revisional court is not competent to disturb the finding and decision arrived at by the last Court of fact. In the instant case it is seen from the judgment of the appellate Court that the said Court on examination of the documents (Ext.1 series) arrived at the finding that those are not genuine. The High Court Division did arrive at the finding that the finding so made by the appellate Court was made upon mis-reading of the evidence or non-consideration of the evidence. The High Court Division without reversing the finding of the appellate Court on the nature and character of the dakhilas (Ext.1 series) exceeded its revisional jurisdiction in disturbing the finding of the appellate Court as regard the genuineness of the dakhilas. Since from the plaintiffs' side no case of mis-reading or. non-consideration of the evidence was made out before the High Court Division as regard the finding arrived at by the appellate Court as to the quality of the Ext.1 series or in other words genuineness of the said Ext.1 series the said Division erred in re-assessing the evidence as to Ext.1 series and thereupon disturbing the finding of the last Court of fact as regard the Ext.1 series. It appears the High Court Division based its judgment on certain observations made by the appellate Court as to the infirmity in the case of the defendant and that as to the steps taken by the plaintiffs in proof of its case. The High Court Division while setting aside the judgment of the appellate Court did not at all address itself to the material findings arrived at by the said Court on the question of taking settlement of the land in suit as claimed by the plaintiffs, nature and quality of the dakhilas produced by the plaintiffs in support of their claim of taking settlement of the land in suit, effect of non-examination of the scribe of the dakhilas and that absence of evidence from the side of the plaintiffs as to that Zamindar consented to the pattan and accepted salami and finally finding of the appellate Court as regard possession in the land in suit by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs examining P.W.1 in support of their claim of taking pattan of the land in suit and examined the P.Ws.2 and 3 for the purpose of corroboration of the evidence of P.W.1 on the point of taking pattan of the land in suit by the plaintiffs. The appellate court upon assigning due reasoning rejected the evidence of P.Ws.2 and 3. It may be mentioned the High Court Division has not reversed the finding of the appellate Court relating to discarding the evidence of P.Ws.2 and 3. The High Court Division overlooked the material fact that there was no reliable evidence to corroborate the evidence of P.W.I as regard the material fact of settling the land by the Zamindar to the plaintiffs. The appellate Court discarded the evidence of P.Ws.2 and 3 on the question of possession of the land in suit by the plaintiffs. This finding of the appellate Court was also not reversed by the High Court Division while making the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong> In the afore state of the matter we are of the view that the High Court Division was in serious error in disturbing the finding of fact arrived at by the appellate Court when the said Division did not hold that the finding and decision made by the appellate Court was vitiated by non-consideration of the evidence or mis-reading of evidence or that the appellate Court left the vital evidence out of consideration tor no valid reason while making its decision on the question of taking pattan of the land in suit by the plaintiffs and the nature and character of the Ext.1 series as well as regarding possession of the plaintiffs.<br/> <br/>In the background of the discussions made hereinabove we are of the view the appeal has merit.<br/> <br/>Accordingly the appeal is allowed with costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
