The writ petition respondent contend­ed in the writ petition that she was born in Tanzania in 1937 and that her parents migrated and were permanently domiciled as residents of Chittagong in 1947. The hus­band of the writ petitioner also came to the then East Pakistan in 1947 from Bombay and permanently settled at Chittagong. The writ petitioner was married to him in 1958 and since then she had been living with her husband at Chittagong. Her children were also born at Chittagong. At the time of fil­ing of the writ petition the writ petitioner was a Canadian resident. She left Chittagong for U.K. on the last day of October, 1971 in connection with her busi­ness abroad and also for safety. Her hus­band obtained permission to reside in the U.K. in 1972. The writ petitioner was stay­ing in U.K. from November 1971 till Bangladesh was liberated with Pakistani passport issued from Chittagong showing permanent address at 35, Panchlaish Residential Area, Chittagong. The writ peti­tioner and her other family members had/have interest in various industries and busi­nesses at Chittagong and Khulna. All these industries have been returned to them by the Government of Bangladesh treating the writ petitioner as a share-holder being a resident of a neutral country. On the 23rd September 1986 the Government of Bangladesh published a Notification in the Bangladesh Gazette under the Abandoned Buildings (Supplementary Provisions) Ordinance, 1985 in the "Ka" list of which the property of the writ petitioner at 35, Panchlaish Residential Area, Chittagong was shown to be included as an abandoned property. The writ petitioner filed Case No. 814 of 1987 before the Court of Settlement for release of the said property from the list of abandoned properties and also for a dec­laration that the said property is not an abandoned property. The writ petitioner was the legal owner of the suit property since 1970. Previously it belonged to her father late Mohammad Ali Meghani who purchased the plot of land from the Government of East Pakistan by a lease deed executed on the 23th May, 1960 and registered on the 4th June, 1960. The father of the writ petitioner constructed a building thereon in 1963 after which the writ petitioner with her husband had been living in the first floor of the said building. Out of natural love and affection the father of the writ petitioner made a gift of the said property to her in Karachi on 20-6-70 on the occasion of her birthday and the said deed of gift was registered in Karachi on 23-6-70. The father of the writ petitioner delivered possession of the case property to her and she took actual physical possession of the case property and resided therein till the last day of October, 1971. The deed of gift was acted upon. The writ petitioner left for U.K. in October, 1971 with her family members. Thereafter the case property was under the care and custody of the caretaker of the writ petitioner who paid all rents, taxes, electricity bills, WASA bills, rates etc. Since 1972 the writ petitioner has been trying to get the said property released from the list of abandoned properties but unfortu­nately her prayers were rejected mainly on the ground that she was a Pakistani National and that her whereabouts were not known. The writ petitioner filed an applica­tion as early as on 25-5-72 before the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Development) Chittagong for release of the said property on the ground that it was not an abandoned property and the said application was duly received on 16-6-72. The writ petitioner thereafter made several representations to the various relevant authorities of the Government clearly stat­ing that she was a Bangladesh Nationality by operation of law and was at present holding Canadian Nationality and that her property is not liable to be declared as an abandoned property. Pursuant to the series of representations made by her an inquiry was held into the matter. She was asked by the Deputy Commissioner, Chittagong by letter dated 6-6-84 to submit documents and papers in support of her claim on 13-6-84. Her authorized agent appeared before the Deputy Commissioner, Chittagong on 12-6-84 and submitted documents and papers in support of her claim on 12-6-84. Her authorized agent appeared before the Deputy Commissioner, Chittagong on 12-6-84 and submitted documents and papers in support of her claim 27-1-85 the writ peti­tioner made a similar application to the Ministry of Works (A.P. Wing) which by let­ter dated 1-4-85 made some inquiries from her and advised her to apply to the Deputy Commissioner, Chittagong. The writ peti­tioner gave satisfactory answers to all the queries made so far but even then the build­ing was not released from the list of aban­doned properties. These are the averments of the writ petitioner in the writ petition.<br/> <br/>3. After hearing the writ petitioner and the Government appellant the Court of Settlement by judgment and Order dated 28-3-88 dismissed the case on two grounds, first, there being no acceptance of the phys­ical possession of the building by the writ petitioner on the basis of the gift in question there was no valid gift, the writ petitioner did not acquire any right, title and interest in the said property on the basis of the gift and secondly, there being no oral and docu­mentary evidence contrary to the resump­tion of section 5(2) of Ordinance No.54 of 1985, the writ petitioner was absent leaving her house uncared for and her whereabouts were not known on and from 28-2-72, which is amply justification for the proper­ty to be declared as abandoned.<br/> <br/>4. The Government appellant as respon­dent stated in its affidavit in opposition that the case property belonged to the father of the writ petitioner Mohammad Ali Methane. In the middle of 1970, Mohammad Ali Meghani and his daughter, the writ petitioner, left erstwhile East Pakistan with thermometers of their family for the then West Pakistan and they never returned. During liberation movement and afterwards the whereabouts of Mohammad Ali Meghani and his daughter were not known to the Government and they were citizens of Pakistan which was at war with the People's Republic of Bangladesh. So the case property absolutely vested with the Government as an abandoned property under P.O. No.16 of 1972 and the case property has been under the control, man­agement and supervision of the Government from the date of enactment of P.O. No. 16 of 1972. Subsequently the writ petitioner on the ill advice of some notori­ous persons created some false, fabricated and collusive papers for the purpose of grabbing the abandoned property. The deed of gift is also a created one and it is antedat­ed, false, forged, collusive, void ab initio, inoperative and not binding upon the appel­lant. The alleged deed of gift was not drawn up according to Mohammadan Law and the same was also not acted upon.<br/> <br/>5. The High Court Division or consider­ation of some case laws decided that the deed of gift was acted upon, that the case property was under the care and custody of the men of the writ petitioner who paid the rents, taxes, electricity bills, WASA bills, rates etc. on her behalf till 1975 when the building was taken over by the Government of Bangladesh as an abandoned property. About the whereabouts of the writ petition­er the High Court Division accepted the submission of the writ petitioner respondent that she left the Country in the later part of October, 1971 and thereafter the property was under her constructive possession through her tenant and caretaker and that the writ petitioner also made correspon­dences from London to various authorities which supports the contention of her learned Counsel.<br/> <br/>6. The judgment of the Court of Settlement was set aside, the case property was directed to be released from the list of abandoned buildings and the Government appellant was directed to deliver possession of the same to the writ petitioner with in three months from the date of receipt of the courts order.<br/> <br/>7. Leave was granted to consider the Government appellants submissions, first, that while exercising jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution the High Court Division was wrong in converting itself into a Court of Appeal and in revers­ing the decision of the Court of settlement without coming to the conclusion that its decision is vitiated by any error of law apparent on the face of the record, second­ly, that the High Court Division not having found that the Court of Settlement acted either without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction or that its material findings, namely that there was no acceptance of physical possession of the building by the writ petitioner on the basis of the gift in question and as such there was no valid gift, that the writ petitioner went to Karachi in 1970 and got the deed of gift staying in Karachi from where she proceeded to the United Kingdom and then to Canada, that the writ petitioner did not return to Chittagong from the date of gift and that the writ petitioner not having adduced any oral or documentary evidence before the court of Settlement to show that she came to Chittagong to accept delivery of possession of the case property, the High Court Division committed an error of law in inter­fering with the above findings of fact of the court of Settlement without coming to the conclusion that these findings were based either on non-consideration of evidence on record or on inadmissible evidence or on no evidence at all.<br/> <br/>8. Mr. A.W. Bhuiyan, learned Additional Attorney General appearing for the Government appellant has taken us through the petition of the writ petitioner before the court of Settlement where in it is stated among others that "it is not known to the applicant (i.e. the writ petitioner) from exactly which date the possession of the building was taken over by the Government. The applicant however under­stands that Bay Fishing Corporation Ltd. an Enterprise of Bangladesh Food and Allied Industries Corporation was in possession of the building till the middle of June, 1975 and thereafter the building was taken over by the District. Administration on 27-6-75 to the best of the knowledge of the appli­cant". It was further stated in the said application that "the applicant is out of posses­sion of the building since 16-12-71 till today." The writ petitioner also stated in the said application that "the applicant herself resided in the building with her family members till she left for U. K. for a short visit towards the end of 1970. Though due to outbreak of the liberation war the appli­cant and her family members did not return to the then West Pakistan the applicant was in possession of the building during this period through her caretaker till immediate­ly before the commencement of the President's Order". It was further stated that" possession of the building was taken over from the caretaker of the applicant who was in possession of the building immediately before the commencement of the president's order. It may be clarified here that the applicant was in possession through the said caretaker till the building was taken over allegedly falling under the mischief of the President's Order".<br/> <br/>9. Mr. A.W. Bhuyan further points out that the court of Settlement passed the judgment on 28-3-88. Subsequently (date not known) the writ petitioner filed an applica­tion for review of the judgment of the Court of Settlement stating in the review petition that she and her family members left for U.K in October, 1971 but through typing mistake it was stated in the original applica­tion before the Court of Settlement that she and her family members left for U.K. in October, 1970. She  asserted that she returned to Chittagong, took over posses­sion of the case property with her family members exercising all her right, interest and  privileges  therein  till  the  end  of October, 1971.<br/> <br/>10. In rejecting the review application by judgment and order dated 24-4-93 the Court of Settlement held that there is no provision for review of a judgment of the Court of Settlement under the provisions of the Abandoned Buildings (Supplementary Provisions) Ordinance, 1985 and as such the review application was not maintain­able.<br/> <br/>11. Mr. A.W. Bhuiyan submits that the writ petitioner has gone on improving her case at various stages, because on 27-1-85 she had written to the Ministry of Works from London vide Annexure-H to the writ petition that she left for London towards the end of 1970 and was living there for the time being. This letter falsifies her subse­quent claim that she lived in Chittagong upto the end of October, 1971. She did not allege that even in Annexure-H there was a typing mistake. The Court of Settlement, he submits did not find any material, either oral or documentary, that the writ petitioner returned to Chittagong from Karachi after the deed of gift was executed and registered and took possession of the case property and enjoyed the same in her own right by paying various bills, rates and taxes. The High Court Division assumed without there being any evidence on record that the writ petitioner was in constructive possession of the case property since the gift through her tenant and caretaker. Not a single piece of oral or documentary evidence has been adduced as to who the tenant was, whether the tenant was attorney by the donor, whether a tenancy agreement was made afresh with the writ petitioner, whether she realized rent from the tenant and declared so in her income tax return, who the care­taker was and how she was in constructive possession through any disclosed caretaker. Blindly accepting the assertion of fresh facts made by the writ petitioner in the writ petition without any supporting evidence the High Court Division interfered with the finding of fact of the court of Settlement that there was no oral or documentary evidence on record to show that the writ peti­tioner ever took possession of the case property after the gift and exercised any control and supervision over the case property in her own right.<br/> <br/>12. Further, he submits, the court of Settlement came to a positive finding that the whereabouts of the writ petitioner were not known to the Government when P.O. No. 16 of 1972 was promulgated. To cir­cumvent this finding it was only orally sub­mitted by the learned Counsel for the writ petitioner in the High Court Division that she was in Chittagong till October, 1971 when she left for U.K. and thereafter she was in constructive possession through her tenant and caretaker. The High Court Division blindly accepted this submission without there being any evidence on record as to who the tenant was and who the care­taker was. The High Court Division failed to take into consideration the writ petition­er's own case in the application before the Court of Settlement that the writ petitioner "is out of possession of the building since 16-12-71 till today". Therefore her case that her caretaker was in possession till 1975 when possession was taken over by the District Administration is an improved ver­sion and does not stand scrutiny, because she herself stated in her application before the Court of Settlement that Bay Fishing Corporation Ltd. an Enterprise of Bangladesh Food and Allied Indus tries Corporation was in possession of the build­ing till the middle of June, 1975." Her state­ment in the said application confirms the appellant's contention that the building in question is in possession, control and cus­tody of the Government since promulgation of P. O. No. 16 of 1972. Mr. Bhuiyan sub­mits that the High Court Division commit­ted a grave error of law in entertaining new facts without considering that in interfering with the decision of an inferior Tribunal all that is to be seen is whether the Tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction or there is want of jurisdiction or there is an error apparent on the face of the record or a finding of fact based on inadmissible evidence, non con­sideration of material evidence on record or on no evidence at all. The High Court Division found no such deficiency in the judgment of the Court of Settlement but interfered with its findings of fact upon assumptions, surmises and conjectures without referring to any evidence that was produced by the writ petitioner before the Court of Settlement.<br/> <br/>13. In reply, Mr. Rafique-ul Huq, learned Counsel for the writ petitioner respondent submits that a deed of gift between a father and a daughter is treated differently under the Mohammadan Law. If the daughter was residing in the gifted building from before the gift it is not neces­sary for her to come back to the building to take actual physical possession thereof afresh. It is enough if she continues to remain in possession. Mr. Rafique-ul Huq submits that in this cases there is evidence that within two months of the deed of gift the writ petitioner applied for mutation of the case property in her name and that her caretaker paid all bills, rates, taxes etc. On her behalf till 1975. Leaving aside the con­troversy whether the writ petitioner left for U.K. in October, 1970 or October, 1971, if the writ petitioner had been continuing in possession after the gift, either actual or constructive, the gift is complete and it has taken full effect. He has cited several deci­sions to show that for a gift of this nature no actual handing over of possession is neces­sary.<br/> <br/>14. Accepting the proposition of law advanced by Mr. Rafique-ul Huq in so far as a gift of a property by a father to a daugh­ter under Mohammadan law is concerned, especially when the daughter has already been residing in the gifted property before the gift, there are still certain lacunae which the writ petitioner has failed to fill up either before the Court of Settlement or in her review petition or in the High Court Division. It is true that after she had been residing in the case building from before the gift, she need not come back to Chittagong to take fresh possession of the building. It is enough if she is in construc­tive possession through either a tenant or a caretaker. The gift was registered in Karachi on the occasion of her birthday and the deed of gift shows that she was in Karachi on 20-6-70 when the gift was made. The deed of gift was also registered in Karachi on 23-6.70. There must be some evidence thereafter, if the issue of delivery of possession is raised at any time there­after, that she was in actual possession or in constructive possession of the building through her tenant or caretaker. The writ petitioner is absolutely silent in her applica­tion before the Court of Settlement as to whether she came back to Chittagong after the gift to take actual possession. Her later case is an improvement. She is also silent as to who her caretaker or tenant was. There is absolutely no assertion and no evidence that any tenant was attorned by her father or that he directed the tenant to pay rents to her. There is also no evidence that any tenant entered into a fresh agreement of tenancy with her after the deed of gift, paid rents to her and that she showed the payment of rent in her income-tax return. There is also no evidence that she ever appointed any care­taker. She even did not disclose who the caretaker was. She has made only a vague statement that she was in constructive pos­session of the case property since the deed of gift without substantiating the same through any oral or documentary evidence. She even admitted that she was out of pos­session of the building since 16-12-71 till today. She admitted that the Bay Fisting Corporation Limited was in possession of the building till the middle of June, 1975 and it is her own case that Bay Fishing Corporation Ltd. was an Enterprise of Bangladesh Food and Allied Industries Corporation. The Government appellants case that the case building was in posses­sion, control and custody of the Government since the promulgation of P. O. No. 16 of 1972 finds support from the writ petitioner's own statements of claim before the Court of Settlement. Further her subse­quent stand that she left for U.K. from Chittagong in October, 1971 is belied by her own statements in her application to the Ministry of Works dated 27-1-85 (Annexure-H) that she left for London in the later part of 1970. There is absolutely no evidence that she returned to Chittagong after the deed of gift was executed and reg­istered in Karachi or that she left for U.K. in October, 1971 from Chittagong. That her whereabouts were not known to the Government before and after the promulga­tion of P.O. No. 16 of 1972 is obvious from her own statement of claims before the Court of Settlement. It therefore appears that the High Court Division without com­ing to any finding that the findings of fact of the Court of Settlement are based on non consideration of material evidence on record or on inadmissible evidence or on no evidence interfered unwarrantedly acting as a Court of Appeal and that also without the support of any evidence on record. All its findings are based on surmises and conjec­tures and not on any evidence on record.<br/> <br/>The Government appellants con­tentions there fore contain sufficient merits and the impugned judgment and order war­rant an interference.<br/> <br/>In the result, the appeal is allowed with­out any order as to costs.<br/> <br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
