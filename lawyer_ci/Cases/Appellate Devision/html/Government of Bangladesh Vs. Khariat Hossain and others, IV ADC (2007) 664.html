Tafazzul Islam J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>Delay of 2 days is condoned.<br/> <br/>2. This petition for leave to appeal arises out of the judgment dated 22.6.2003 of the High Court Division passed in Civil Revision No. 1229 of 1992 making absolute the Rule obtained against the judgment and decree dated 12.04.92 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Rangpur in Other Appeal No. 237 of 1988 reversing those of dated 18.08.88 passed by the learned Assistant Judge, Rangpur Sadar in Other Suit No. 459 of 1987 decreeing the suit.<br/> <br/>3. The respondents 1 and 2 filled (filed) the above suit on the averments that Bimalendu Roy, Tarini Prasad and two others took pattan of the suit land and C.S. Record was prepared in their names and subsequently Tarini Prasad and the two others surrendered the property in favour of the original landlord who then took the same to his Khas possession; Abdul Aziz, the father of the plaintiffs, then took pat-tan of the suit land by registered kabaliat in the year 1943 and went into possession of the same on payment of rent to the landlord and S.A. record was duly pre­pared in the name of Abdul Aziz; subse­quently on 13.10.82 the land was trans­ferred to the plaintiffs by a deed of haba-bill-ewaj; and the plaintiffs, continued to possess the suit land on payment of rent to the government then Abdul Hamid and others, with malafide motive, filed a false petition to enlist the suit land as Shariat and at their instance the defendant No.1 the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Rev), Rangpur, by order dated 13.03.84 passed in Misc. Case (Shariat No.9 of 1983-84) cancelled the record of rights and declared the suit land as government khas land and directed the defendant No.2, the Thana Upazilla Revenue Officer, to take over the possession of the suit land and then the plaintiffs filed the instant suit challenging the above order dated 13.03.84. The defendant Nos.1 and 2 contested the suit by filing written state­ment contending, inter alia, that the suit land being a beel is the khas land of the government and the claim of the plaintiffs is vague and based on fabricated papers and further since the kabuliyat was for one year only there is no legal basis of the claim of the plaintiffs after the expiry of one year. The trial court, after hearing, decreed the suit. The defendant Nos.1 and 2 filed appeal which, after hearing, was allowed and the suit was dismissed. On revision the High Court Division made the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the High Court Division erred in law In setting aside the findings of the appellate court without properly discussing and controverting the findings of the lower appellate court which are based on sound reasons upon considera­tion of materials on records and the suit land being beel and khas land of the Government and the papers of the plain­tiffs being fabricated and the plaintiffs having failed to establish their right title and possession in the suit land and the kabuliyat being made for only one year, the claim of the plaintiffs has no legal force as the period of kabuliyat expired.<br/> <br/>5. As it appears the High Court Division made the rule absolute holding that there is no dispute as to the fact that the suit land was taken settlement by the father of the plaintiffs from the original landlord upon execution of a registered kabuliyat in the year 1943 and the language and terms of the kabuliyat indicate that the same is not such an agreement which will terminate automatically at the end of one year term as specified therein; the kabu­liyat described the suit land as cultivable land and the conditions contained therein show the that the suit land is to be used for the purpose of cultivation and so it is dif­ficult to accept the submission that the suit land could subsequently be properly described as beel; nine defence witnesses though deposed to the effect that the suit land is used for the purpose of fishery but the above evidence should not be allowed to outweigh the evidence contain in the registered kabuliyat which described the land as cultivable land, more so, when the trial court came to a specific finding that the evidence of defence witnesses was not believable; and since the witnesses physi­cally appeared before the trial court the learned Assistant Judge was in a better position to assess the veracity of their evi­dence and also the evidentiary value of the deposition of those witnesses, in Rule 23(4) of the Tenancy Rules which was added by Gazette Notification on the 7th of April, 1967, an additional power was given to the Revenue Officer to deal with cases involving fraud which was not cov­ered within section 143 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act and so the submission of the learned advocate of the petitioner that the Revenue Officer does not have the authority to cancel the record of rights under this provision of law has basis; in the facts and circumstances of the instant case there does not appear to be any incidence of fraud as quite clearly the plaintiffs predecessor went into pos­session of the suit land on the strength of a registered document and he continued to remain in possession until coming into force of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act and also thereafter and moreover it is also evident from Exhibit-3 that the government has accepted the predecessor of the plaintiffs as tenant and received rent from him from 1956 up to 1981 and therefore, it cannot be said that the predecessor of the plaintiffs was in illegal possession; Abdul Aziz, the prede­cessor of the plaintiffs, continued to be in possession of the suit land by way of holdingover as tenant and became a tenant under the Government on the coming into force of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act and hence there was no ille­gality or irregularity in the record of rights; the suit land was described in the kabuliyat as cultivable land and the kabuliyat was granted for the purpose of culti­vation and hence in the absence of any local verification to show that the nature of the suit land changed subsequently it must be presumed that the suit land remained as it was at the time of kabuliy­at i.e. cultivable land and; S.A. record was created from earlier records based on "Table Surver" as distinguished from local or filed survey, and therefore S.A. Record does not necessarily reflect the true nature of the land and moreover it is apparent from the records that upon inquiry, the Magistrate found the suit land to be used for purposes of cultivation and is in possession of the plaintiffs.<br/> <br/>6. We are of the view that High Court Division after due consideration of the evidence and materials on record and answering the relevant issues arrived at a correct decision and there is no cogent reason to interfere with the said decision.<br/> <br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
