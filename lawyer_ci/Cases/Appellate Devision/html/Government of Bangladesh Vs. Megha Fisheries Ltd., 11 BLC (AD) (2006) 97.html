Nawab Ali, Advocate-on-Record—For the Respondent.<br/> <br/><strong>Civil Appeal No. 228 of 2004. </strong><br/>(From the Judgment and order date 7-7-2003 passed by the High Court Division in First Appeal No. 456 of 2000).<br/> <br/><strong>JUDGMENT</strong><br/> <br/><strong><u>Amirul Kabir Chowdhury J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh represented by the Deputy Commissioner, Mymensingh preferred this appeal against the judgment and order dated 7-7-2003 passed by the High Court Division in First Appeal No. 456 of 2000 dismissing the appeal.<br/> <br/>2. The facts leading to the appeal are that the appellant as the plaintiff instituted Other Class Suit No.12 of 1996 for declaration that the registered lease deed No. 4330 dated 15-6-1996 between the plaintiff-appellant and defendant Megha Fisheries Ltd is null and void and not binding upon the plaintiff. In the suit, it has been stated that the defendant fisheries, a Public Ltd Co applied to the government for long term lease of 155.39 acres of non-agricultural land for fish cultivation in scientific way; that after enquiries and observing all formalities the lease was granted to the defendant in respect of aforesaid non-agricultural land within Bhaluka PS District-Mymensingh for a period of 10 years at a Salami of Taka 9,30,396/07 and on receipt of first instalment of Salami amounting to Taka 1,86,079/22 a lease deed was registered on 15-6-1996 and that the Deputy Commissioner during the subsistence of lease cancelled the lease on 10-9-1996 on the plea that same terms and conditions in the draft of the original lease deed agreed upon by both the parties were altered/modified before registration of the deed by the respondent Co without the consent of the plaintiff-petitioner. It was alleged that the terms and conditions in the draft agreement which were earlier approved by the plaintiff being deleted some new conditions had been included by the defendant Co by practicing fraud.<br/> <br/>3. The defendant-respondent contested the suit denying material allegations made in the plaint and it was contended, inter alia, that the lease agreement was properly drafted incorporating therein the terms of the agreement agreed upon by both the parties; that several officials of the Deputy Commissioner perused the lease agreement before execution and accordingly it was legally registered and that the defendant-respondent committed neither any wrong nor any fraud as alleged but the Deputy Commissioner most  illegally cancelled the valid lease and the suit was filed   malafide and prayed for dismissal of the suit.<br/> <br/>4. Upon recording evidence and hearing the parties the learned Subordinate Judge dismissed the suit, against which the petitioner took an appeal and the learned Judges of the High Court Division dismissed the appeal as aforesaid.<br/> <br/>5. Leave was granted to consider the submission that the learned Subordinate Judge wrongly dismissed the suit on misconception of the provisions of sections 39 and 42 of the Specific Relief Act and also the provision of Evidence Act and that the High Court Division committed error in not considering that the defendant-respondent committed a fraud by altering the original terms of the lease agreement vitiating the transaction.<br/> <br/>6. In support of the appeal Mr Fida M Kamal, learned Additional Attorney-General, reiterated the submissions made earlier at the time of hearing of the leave petition.<br/> <br/>7. He further submits that there being a “bxwZgvjv" issued by the Government published in Bangladesh Gazette dated 8 March, 1995 the directive given therein are required to be embodied in the lease of long term settlement for fisheries, but the lease dated 10-6-1996 executed in favour of the defendant-respondent being violative of the defectives the “bxwZgvjv" and fraud being practised in getting the lease deed executed the courts below ought to have found that the plaintiff is not bound by the aforesaid illegal lease deed and thus committed error in dismissing the suit.<br/> <br/>8. Mr. Khandker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the defendant-respondent, opposes the appeal stating inter alia, that the learned Subordinate Judge, on consideration of materials on record including the evidence, found that the plaintiff failed to make out the lease and, as such, correctly dismissed the suit, and that the High Court Division, in its turn, affirmed the said judgment of the trial Court and there being no illegality in the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division, the appeal is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/>9. We have considered the submissions made at the Bar and perused the materials on record. The plaintiff-appellant instituted the suit for a declaration deed of lease executed between the parties was a void and fraudulent document and not binding upon the plaintiff on the assertion that the aforesaid deed has been executed not on the basis of original draft agreed upon between the parties but on some clauses of the previously agreed draft being altered, altered, the deed has been registered and thus fraud has been practiced.<br/> <br/>10. It appears that the trial Court considered the evidence of the parties. The solitary witness of the plaintiff Md Golum Mostafa deposed that the the draft agreement was approved on 9-6-1996 by the Revenue Deputy Collector (RDC), Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC) and Deputy Commissioner and it was accordingly executed by the parties on 10-6-1996 and registered on 15-6-1996.The witness deposed that he was not aware of the terms of the draft deed nor he knew what are the conditions of the draft agreement those have been violated in the aforesaid impugned lease deed dated10-6-1996 nor he read the draft agreement. The assertion of the plaintiff-appellant has been denied by the defendant-respondent. Except lump averment in the plaint, there is no other material to prove the fraud allegedly commit­ted by the defendant respondent.<br/> <br/>11. It appears that the draft agreement purported to have been made has not been produced before any courts. The plaintiff further asserted that after the fraud was detected the plaintiff called the defendant-respondent and after discussion with the consent of the defendant a ‘ঘোষনাপত্র দলিল’ was made but the said ‘ঘোষনাপত্র দলিল’ was also not produced before any Court.<br/> <br/>12. Furthermore, it appears that the plaintiff cancelled the lease and did not deliver the possession of the land in favour of the defendant. It such view of the matter we are unable to understand what prompted the plaintiff to file the suit for cancellation of the deed of lease on the face of ‘ঘোষনাপত্র দলিল’ between the parties.<br/> <br/>13. We have given our anxious consideration to the facts and circumstances of the case and we are of the view that the Subordinate Judge did not commit any illegality in dismissing the suit.<br/> <br/>14.  We have also perused the impugned judgment of the High Court Division. There is no illegality in the aforesaid judgment.<br/> <br/>15. In such view of the matter the grounds canvassed on behalf of the appellant have no leg to stand and, as such, we do not find any substance in this appeal.<br/> <br/>The appeal is dismissed without any order as to cost.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
