Ruhul Amin J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This petition has been filed seeking review of the judgment dated February 22, 2004 passed in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 1105 of 2001. The petition for leave to appeal was filed against the judgment dated March 1, 2001 of a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 1045 of 1994 making absolute the Rule. The writ petition was filed challenging the legality of the judgment and order dated December 30, 1993 of the 1st Court of Settlement, Dhaka in Case No.16 of 1991 relating to a property in Mohammadpur. The property in question was listed as abandoned property. The Court of Settlement dismissed the case but being challenged before the High Court Division in writ jurisdiction the judgment and order of the Court of Settlement was set aside and the property in question was declared as not abandoned property and direction was made to hand over possession to the claimant.<br/> <br/>2. This Court while rejecting the petition for leave to appeal filed against the judg­ment of the High Court Division noticed that the High Court Division made the Rule absolute on the finding that no tangi­ble evidence was brought before the Court in justification of listing the property in the list of abandoned property and further it was noticed by the High Court Division that the competent authority at one point of time recommended to the Ministry of Works for releasing the property from the list Of abandoned property and the author­ity took step for handing over the proper­ty in question to the claimant but ultimate­ly did not deliver the possession. It was also noticed by the High Court Division from the materials on record that the authority found that the original owner of the property did not leave Bangladesh dur­ing the war of liberation or thereafter, rather he died in Bangladesh in 1973. In the background of the said finding and decision of the High Court Division this Division having had not found any merit for interference with the judgment of the High Court Division, dismissed the peti­tion for leave to appeal.<br/> <br/>3. The learned Additional Attorney General could not point out any error apparent on the face of the judgment sought to be reviewed. Nor the petition for review has been filed upon discovery of new fact. In that state of the matter we do not find any merit in this petition.<br/> <br/>Accordingly the review petition is dis­missed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
