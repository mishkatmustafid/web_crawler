Admittedly, CS Plots Nos. 10714, 10715 and 10716, in total 1.35 acres of the lands, described in schedule 'Kha' to the plaint, are recorded in the name of the Secretary of the School; that the school building is situated on the northern side of plot No. 10716; and that since the establishment of the school in 1929, a cattle market is sitting on every Wednesday over the land in the southern portion of RS Plot No. 10716. By an order on 31st May, 1969, the Government held out that the cattle market would be leased out by an open auction.<br/> <br/>3. The Government, appellant before us, contested the suit stating inter alia that the that the Shakhipur cattle market sits on every Wednesday over the land of Plots Nos. 10803, 10804, 10793 and 10794 and over a nominal portion of the southern side of Plaintiffs Plot No. 107116, and that the plaintiffs suit was barred by section 20(2a) of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act.<br/> <br/>4. The trial court decreed the suit after considering the <strong><em>Secretary, Muktagacha Abbasia Senior Madrassa Vs. The Province of East Pakistan, 15 DLR 37.</em></strong> It held that the suit land was not a non‑retainable land and that the Government's Order dated 31st May, 1969 was void and illegal.<br/> <br/>5. After considering the decision in <strong><em>11 DLR (SC) 316</em></strong>, the amendment of section 20 by Ordinance No. XII of 1960, and the decision in <strong><em>15 DLR (SC) 139</em></strong>, the appellate court held that the plaintiff is not entitled to get declaration of his title in respect of the disputed plot where the cattle market sits. After finding that it is not possible for the court to declare plaintiffs title in respect of the area retainable by the plaintiff without determining by local investigation the area of the portion of the plot over which the cattle market sits, the appellate court remanded the case for fresh trial after getting the market area demarcated by local investigation.<br/> <br/>6. Relying on <strong><em>Yusuf Ali Chowdhury Vs. Province of East Pakistan, 11 DLR (SC) 3161</em></strong> the High Court Division set aside the order of the appellate court after holding that as the cattle market assembles only once a week, and remains vacant on other days, it is not a hat at all.<br/> <br/>7. The appellant contends that the High Court Division misconstrued the meaning of hat as defined in clause (12) of section 2 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act. It is submitted that the High Court Division ought to have applied sub‑section (2) of section 13 of the General Clauses Act in construing the meaning of the word 'days' in the definition of hat.<br/> <br/>8. Sub‑section (2) of section 13 of General Clauses Act provides that in all Acts of Parliament and Regulations, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context, words in the singular shall include the plural, and vice versa.<br/> <br/>9. Respondent contends that the impugned decision suffers from no infirmity. In support of his contention that sub‑section (2) of section 13 of the General Clauses Act ought not to be applied mechanically in every case, reliance is placed on <strong><em>A. Roberio Vs. Labour Appellate Tribunal, 27 DLR 98</em></strong>. In that case the Labour Appellate Tribunal by applying section 13 of the General Clauses Act held that the word 'workmen' includes 'workman' and the word employers includes 'employer' in the following definition clause, clause (XIII) of section 2 of the Industrial Relations Ordinance, 1969-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Industrial dispute" means any dispute or difference between employees and employers or between employers and workmen or between workmen and workmen, which is connected with the employment or non‑employment or the terms of employment or the conditions of work of any person."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>After considering the background of the legislation and some other provisions of the IRO, 1969, the Tribunal's interpretation was rejected and it was held that the dispute brought by the petitioner against an order of dismissal was an individual dispute and not an industrial dispute within the meaning of clause (XIII) of section 2. Without getting into the merit of the decision, we uphold the view, expressed in many other decisions as well, that section 13 of the General Clauses Act cannot be applied mechanically because the provision itself provides that it will be applicable "unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context." In the instant matter apart from relying on the above decision in general terms, the respondent has made no effort to show from the history of the legislation or from any other provision of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act that Sub‑section (2) of section 13 of the General Clauses Act cannot be applied to hold that the word 'days' in the definition of 'hat' includes a day as well.<br/> <br/>10. Let us refer to the <em>ratio</em> <em>decidendi </em>in <strong><em>Yusuf Ali Chowdhury Vs. Province of East Pakistan 11, DLR (SC) 316 (318)</em></strong><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"The sole question for determination in this case, therefore, is whether hats and bazars fall within the three classes of lands mentioned in sec. 20(2)(b). From the Khatian (Revenue Record) relating to these hats and bazar exhibited in the case, Plot No. 341 is a bazar and in the remarks column it is stated that it is held every day in the morning; from the affidavit it appears that there are also certain structures on this land. With regard to the other disputed plots, Nos. 342 and 346 are described, as hats and in the remarks column it is stated 'Gohata once in a week on every Tuesday'. The hats remain vacant except being used as a hat for sale of cattle for some time once a week. In the circumstances of the case, we are of opinion that the <em>bazar</em> in question does not come under any of the three sub‑clauses of clause (b) of sub‑section (2) of section 20, but that the hats come under sub‑clause (iii) as vacant non­agricultural land."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>11. It is clear from the above that the Supreme Court emphasised on the fact that the gohata was a non‑agricultural land and it remained vacant for six days a week and hence it came under sub‑clause (iii) of section 20(2)(b). That the gohata was not a hat at all, because, it sat only once a week, no such contention was squarely raised either before the High Court, see the report in <strong><em>9 DLR 674,</em></strong> or before the Supreme Court <strong><em>11 DLR (SC) 316.</em></strong><br/> <br/>12. We find from the decision in <strong><em>15 DLR (SC) 139 (141)</em></strong> that after the decision in <strong><em>11 DLR (SC) 316,</em></strong> seventeen petitions were filed in the High Court of East Pakistan, claiming that the petitioners were entitled to retain possession of the hats belonging to them in spite of the acquisition of their interests under the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act. During the pendency of the petitions, the following new sub‑section (2a) was inserted in section 20 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1951, by East Pakistan Ordinance No. XII of 1960.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"(2a) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument or in any judgment or decree or order of any court, Lands of the classes referred to in the clauses (a) and (b) of sub‑section (2) do not include and shall be deemed never to have included-<br/>(i) any land or building in a hat or bazar, or, ..............”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>13. In <strong><em>13 DLR (SC) 139 and in 16 DLR (SC) 281,</em></strong> the vires of the amended provision of section 20 was upheld. The respondent does not contest the legal provision of non‑ retainibility of hats, but contends that in the instant case, the cattle market sits only on Wednesday and it can not be called as a hat at all. Our attention has been drawn to the definition of hat given in Wilson's Glossary: "A movable market, a market, one held only on certain days in a week, a fair." The term 'hat' is defined in clause (12) of section 2 of the Act:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Section 2(12).- <em>"hat</em>" or <em>"bazar</em>" means any place where persons assemble daily or on particular days in a week primarily for the purposes of buying or selling agricultural or horticultural produce, livestock, poultry, hides, skins, fish, eggs, milk, milk-products or any other articles of food or drink or other necessaries of life, and includes all shops of such articles or manufactured article within such place."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>14. In <strong><em>Hashem Ali Howlader &amp; others Vs. Province of East Pakistan and others, 20 DLR 18 </em></strong>(1968), cited by the respondent, <strong>Murshed, CJ,</strong> held that "the requirement is that the alleged hat or bazar sits either daily or <u>on a particular day</u> of the week, which, of necessity, means that there must be some regularity in the sitting of the bazar with regard to a <u>particular day </u>in a week" (underlinings are ours). As there was no evidence on record as to the regularity of sale of <em><u>golplatas</u></em> on the land in question, it was held the suit‑land could not be described as a hat or bazar.<br/> <br/>15. In <strong><em>SM</em></strong> <strong><em>Nurul Huq Vs. Province of East Pakistan and another, 25 DLR 476,</em></strong> it was held that a hat which sits regularly once in a week where people assemble for marketing their commodities and making purchase, comes within the meaning of the clause (12) of section 2. The existence of permanent shops and huts in the hat of that case was regarded as a distinguishing feature from the cattle market in <strong><em>11 DLR (SC) 316</em></strong> that sat only on Tuesday and remained vacant for the rest of the week. The High Court's decision did, however, rest on sub‑section (2a) of section 20.<br/> <br/>16. A hat or bazar sitting once in a week is not uncommon in this country. If a hat sits once a week regularly then it will come under mischief of the Act. If we read the expression "particular days" in the definition of 'hat or bazar' together and give the necessary emphasis, the word 'particular' deserves, then it will be clear that the word 'days' will also include a day as well in view of sub‑section (2) of section 13 of the General Clauses Act and in view of the history of the legislation of the acquisition of interest in <em>hats and bazars</em> by the Government. The view taken by the learned Judge of the High Court Division is, therefore, unsustainable and liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/>17. The cattle market in this case covers quite large area comprising khas lands of the Government, private lands, and a portion of the plaintiffs Plot No. 10716. The plaintiff is not entitled to retain that portion under sub‑section 2(a) of section 20 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act and that portion is to be demarcated by local investigation before the suit can be decreed with regard to the rest of the plot.<br/> <br/>18. We set aside the judgment of the High Court Division and uphold that of the court of appeal below directing remand. The appeal is allowed. The trial Court will decide the suit in the light of the judgment of the appellate Court. No costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
