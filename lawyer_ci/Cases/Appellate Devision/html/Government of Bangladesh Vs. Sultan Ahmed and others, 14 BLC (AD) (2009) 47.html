Ruhul Amin J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>Delay of 4 days is condoned. This petition for leave to appeal has been filed against the judgment dated March 30, 2004 of a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 3225 of 1999 discharging the Rule obtained against the judgment and decree dated July 17, 1997 of the 2nd Court of Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Feni in Title Appeal No. 33 of 1996 allowing the same upon reversing the judgment and decree dated March 9, 1996 of the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Dagan-bhuiyan, Feni in Title Suit No. 84 of 1987 dismissing the same.<br/> <br/>2. The suit was filed seeking declaration of title and for khas possession upon removing the structures in the land in suit.<br/> <br/>3. The suit was filed averring that the land in suit belonged to plaintiff's predecessor and that after the death of his father plaintiff and others inherited the land in suit, that the plaintiff purchased the share of his sister and that his mother gifted her share by registered Heba-bil-Ewaz to the plaintiff, that the plaintiff is in possession of the land and got his name mutated in the revenue record and paying rent, that defendant Nos.2 and 3 dispossessed him from part of the land and raised a structure covering 3/8 decimals of land out of 29V2 deci­mals of land, that the defendants dispossessed the plaintiff on July 13, 1987, that on inquiry plaintiff came to know that for acquisition of 1.24 acres of land including the land in suit LA Case No. 2 of 1924-25 was initiated but no com­pensation was paid, nor possession was taken over by any authority, that later on in 1962 another proceeding for requisition was started, but the same was dropped by the defendant No. 4 by his letter dated June 5, 1962, that defendant No.1 in collusion with the defen­dant Nos. 2 and 3 dispossessed the plaintiff from the land described in schedule 'ka' and that threatened to dispossess the plaintiff from the land described in schedule 'Kha'. Hence the suit for declaration of title and for recovery of khas possession.<br/> <br/>4. After the filing of the suit an applica­tion seeking injunction was filed and the defen­dants contested the said prayer of injunction by filing written objection stating, inter alia, that the land in suit including other land measuring 1.24 acres was acquired in LA Case No. 2 of 1924-25 for construction of Dagonbhuiyan Charitable Hospital and compensation was duly paid to the owner including the plaintiff's predecessor, Ibrahim and that at the present Thana Health Complex stands on the land in suit. It may be mentioned the defendants did not file any written statement in denial of the averment made in the plaint, and did not examine any witness, nor contested the suit by cross-examining the witness examined by the plaintiff.<br/> <br/>5. The trial Court dismissed the suit on the finding that the plaintiff has no title in the land in suit as the title of his predecessor, i.e. father, extinguished by acquisition in LA Case No. 2 of 1924-25 and thus possession of the plaintiff is not legal.<br/> <br/>6. The plaintiff went on appeal and the appellate Court upon allowing the appeal decreed the suit on the finding that the land in suit  stands  recorded  in  the  name  of the plaintiff's father and one Nazir Ahmed, that the defendants did not challenge the correctness of the record so prepared in the name of the plaintiff's father and one Nazir Ahmed, that plaintiff is paying the rent and the same is supported by the paper filed by the plaintiff, that from the defendants' side no paper was filed to show that the land in suit was acquired and that compensation was paid to the claim­ant of the land i.e. plaintiff's father Ibrahim, that from the papers filed on behalf of the plaintiff it is seen that Dagonbhiiiyan Health Complex is in plot Nos. 132 and 133 and the land claimed by the plaintiff is of plot Nos.147 and 148 and 150. As against the judgment of the lower appellate Court the petitioners moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained Rule.<br/> <br/>7. The High Court Division discharged the Rule on the finding that the plaintiff has title in the land in suit and that the finding of the trial Court as to possession of the plaintiff in the land in suit is not based on any evidence since papers filed at the time of hearing of the injunction petition from the side of the defendants were not admitted into evidence, nor any witness deposed on behalf of the defendants to prove the papers filed by them at the time of hearing of the injunction petition, that plaintiff led evidence to prove his possession and the evidence so led by the plaintiff in support of his claim of possession was not challenged from the defendants' side, that the plaintiff's claim of possession of the land in suit is rather admitted or in other words undisputed, although the said possession of the plaintiff was considered by the trial Court illegal for which there was no basis, nor said finding was made on the basis of any material legally brought on record by the defendants, that record of right stands in the name of the plaintiff and he is paying rent, that there was local inspection and also there was relay of the land in suit by a survey knowing Advocate Commissioner and the Advocate Commissioner submitted his report which was marked as Exhibit 10 wherein it was noted that no structure either of the Dagonbhuiyan Charitable Hospital or Thana Health Complex exists in the land in suit, that the report of the Advocate Commissioner was not challenged by the defendants, that from the plaintiff's side papers were filed wherein it was noticed by the appellate Court that the requisition proceeding initiated in respect of the land in suit was dropped, that no paper showing acquisition of the land and payment of compensation was filed from the side of the defendants.<br/> <br/>8. We have heard the learned Deputy Attorney-General and perused the materials on record. The last Court of fact on consideration of the materials on record held that the plaintiff has title in the land in suit and is in possession of the land in suit as the recorded tenant evidenced by the record of right and that no material was brought on record from the side of the defendants in support of their contention that the land in suit was acquired while plaintiff's father was alive and compensation was paid, that materials on record show that in 1962 competent authority informed the plaintiff that requisition proceeding initiated as regard the land in suit and other land has been drop­ped. The defendants did not challenge the genuineness of the papers showing dropping of the requisition proceeding in 1962. On our query the learned Deputy Attorney-General could not give satisfactory reply as to had the land in suit been acquired in 1924-25 then what prompted the Government to go for initiating the requisition proceeding in 1962. The learned Deputy Attorney-General could also not show us from the materials on record as to the basis of the finding of the trial Court that the land in suit and other lands were acquired in 1924-25 and that possession of the plaintiff in the land in suit is not legal. The learned Deputy Attor­ney-General could also not give satisfactory explanation about the fact noted in Exhibit 10 i.e. Advocate Commissioner's report wherein it was mentioned that there is no structure of Dagonbhuiyan Charitable Hospital and the Thana Health Complex in the land in suit. It may be mentioned no objection was filed against the report of the Advocate Commis­sioner. The High Court Division taking the aforementioned material along with the other materials into consideration arrived at the finding that the plaintiff has right, title and pos­session in the land in suit. The learned Deputy Attorney-General could not point out any infirmity in the finding of the High Court Divi­sion made as regard the right, title and pos­session of the plaintiff in the land in suit and that claim of the defendants in respect of the land in suit has not been substantiated by producing oral or documentary evidence.<br/> <br/>In the background of the discussions made hereinabove we find no merit in the petition.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
