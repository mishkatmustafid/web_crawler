The respondent preferred Writ Petition No.2293 of 1993 challenging the acquisi­tion notification No. For. 6M-31/61/1686 dated 18.11.1961 published by the Agriculture Department in the Dhaka Gazette on 30th November, 1961 declar­ing the lands detailed in the schedule of the said Notification, which includes the schedule land of the petitioner, as khas waste land situated at different Mouzas of the then greater Rajshahi District as protected forest land with effect from date of the notification contending, amongst oth­ers, that the petitioner's land measuring 4.46 acres in C.S. Plot Nos.1/606, 49,60,67,81,117, 370 appertaining to C.S. Khatian No.1, corresponding to S.A. Khatian No.88 and R.S. Khatian No.2/1 of Mouja-Gurkhi, District-Naogaon (previ­ously Rajshahi) under Rajshahi Division, originally belonged to Zaminder Binoy Krisno Bondopadday and Debes Chandra Mukhopodday and that on their behalf the Official Receiver transferred the land to one Samsuddin Mondal of village-Moharazpur, District-Nawabgonj, granti­ng pattan on receipt of salami and granted dakhila and that said Samsuddin Mondal. the pattan holder, while thus possessing and enjoying usufructs therefrom sold the said land to the writ petitioner by regis­tered sale deed dated 20.04.1968 and being owner as aforesaid the writ petition­er got her name mutated and obtained the R.S. Khatian No.2/1 published in her name and since her purchase she is in pos­session and enjoying usufructs therefrom declaring her owner-ship in public and has been growing paddy in the paddy field and rearing fish in the ponds peacefully, unin­terruptedly and without any objection from any quarter and has been paying rents to the Government; but in the middle of March, 1997 some people from the local forest office, Faikbandha, claimed the suit land to be the property of Forest Department on production of copy of the gazette notification dated 18.11.1961, copy of which has been annexed to the writ petition as Annexure-F, and hence the cause of action.<br/> <br/>3. The Rule was contested by the appellant hereof denying all the material allegations and asserting that land in question is khas waste land belong to the Forest Department as has been declared by the Government vide notification dated 18.11.1961 published in exercise of power conferred by Section 29 of the Forest Act, 1927 gazetted on 30.11.1961 and that the alleged sale deed of the petitioner is a forged and antidated document and the purchase of the suit land in 1968 is illegal prima-facie in view of notification dated 18.11.1961 gazetted on 30.11.1961.<br/> <br/>4. The High Court Division on considera­tion of the documents annexed to the writ petition as well as the submissions of the learned Advocates of the contesting par­ties made the Rule absolute without any order as to costs declaring that the gazette notification dated 18.11.1961 published on 30.11.1961 (Annexure-F to the writ petition) so far relates to the property detailed in the schedule of the writ petition is illegal and without lawful authority and of no legal effect.<br/> <br/>5. The High Court Division in making the Rule absolute observed that the suit land as detailed in the record of right has been described as 'Pukur par' (bank of the pond) and hence the suit land are not forest or waste land and that the record of right though not document of title but it is rebuttable evidence as to possession which proceeds to show title in the land and that the Government by accepting rents has admitted the writ petitioner as tenant under it, since supported by rent payment receipt annexed to the writ peti­tion and   that the respondent. Forest Department could not produce any materi­al in support of it's claim of possession in the suit land.<br/> <br/>6. Being aggrieved respondent Forest Department moved the Appellate Division in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.888 of 2001 and on consideration of the materials on record and the submis­sions of the learned Advocate the Appellate Division granted leave to appeal to consider whether the High Court Division erred in law in discarding the gazette notification, which shows that the case property has vested in the Government as Government khas waste land and is protected land and that the writ petition as framed and filed is not main­tainable inasmuch as the question of pos­session and title cannot be decided with­out taking evidence inasmuch as dispute as to title and possession have been raised against the claim of the petitioner.<br/> <br/>7. On behalf of the respondent the learned Advocate-on-Record Mr. Aftab Hossain submitted that as he has no instruction, he could not file the concise statement on behalf of the respondent-petitioner and accordingly he did not participate in the hearing.<br/> <br/>8. The learned Additional Attorney General as appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that the High Court Division has erred in law in declaring the suit land as private land and has illegally discarded the gazette notification. The learned Additional Attorney General sub­mitted that once a property is declared as khas waste land through the gazette notifi­cation in exercise of it's power conferred by sub-Section (3) of Section 29 of the Forest Act, 1927 (Act-XVI of 1927) in accordance with law, vesting of such prop­erty can not be challenged till such gazette notification is declared illegal, without lawful authority and of no legal effect. The learned Advocate taking us through Section-29 of the Forest Act,1927 submit­ted that the khas waste land is Forest Land and is protected.<br/> <br/>9. The learned Additional Attorney General further submitted that it has been categorically  stated in the affidavit-in-opposition that the registered deed of the petitioner is a forged ante-dated document and that in view of the existence of the gazette notification dated 18.11.1961 pub­lished on 30.11.1961 any purchase there­after in respect of any land covered by the said notification is ex-facie, illegal and without lawful authority having no validi­ty in the eye of law and that the petitioner taking advantage of the non-availability of the original records, since destroyed with the furring of the relevant Registration Office during 1971, has created the anti-dated forged document of sale and that the petitioner being unsuccessful in her attempts to get relief from the Civil Court, has now come up with this writ petition malafide and that the suit land has been rightly recorded in the name of the Forest Department in the R.S. Khatian and that the petitioner unsuccessfully tried to remove the name of the Forest Department and to mutate her name in the records of right in respect of the suit land.<br/> <br/>10. We have perused the concise statement submitted on behalf of the appellant as well as the impugned judgment passed by the High Court Division and the Writ Petition with Annexures as filed.<br/> <br/>11. It is admitted position that the suit land are covered by the notification No. For. 6M-31/61/1686 dated 18.11.1961 pub­lished in the Dhaka Gazette on 30.11.1961, copy of which has been annexed to the writ petition, and it further appears from the said notification that the suit land has been described as khas waste land and the said land has been acquired by the Government under Section 29(3) of the Forest Act and thus the said land are protected with effect from the date of pub­lication of the notification in the gazette. Consequently the registered sale deed of the petitioner, alleged to have been exe­cuted and registered in 1968 showing sale of the suit land, is an invalid document in the eye of law inasmuch as without delisting the suit land from the aforesaid notifi­cation dated 18.11.1961 published in the gazette on 30.11.1961 the same could not be transferred legally by any person to any other person and thus the sale deed in ref­erence has no validity and the transfer has been made without lawful authority and has no legal effect.<br/> <br/>12. Apart from this the learned Additional Attorney General has rightly submitted that the question as to the possession of as well as the dispute as to recording of the name in respect of the suit land in the records of right, cannot be resolved with­out taking evidence, which is discouraged in the writ jurisdiction.<br/> <br/>13. In the premises we find substance in the appeal. Accordingly the appeal is allowed without any order as to costs. The impugned judgment and order dated 28.02.2001 passed by the High Court Division making the rule absolute in Writ Petition No. 2293 of 1997 declaring the title of the suit land in favor of the writ petitioner and further declaring that the gazette notification dated 18.11.1961, so far relates to the suit land, is without law­ful authority, are hereby set aside.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
