Md. Wahidullah, Advocate-on-Record - For the petitioner<br/>Sharifuddin Chaklader, Advocate-on-Record - Respondents Nos. 2 &amp; 3<br/>Not Represented - Respondent No. 1.<br/> <br/><strong>Civil Appeal No. 17 of 1998. </strong><br/>(From the Judgment and Order dated 3 February 1994 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 1588 of 1989)<br/> <br/><strong>JUDGMENT</strong><br/> <br/><strong><u>Mohammad Abdur Rouf J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>Defendant Nos. 2-5, the Government of Bangladesh and its three officials have preferred this appeal, on leave, from the judgment and order dated 3.2.94 passed by a learned Single Judge of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 1588 of 1989 making the Rule absolute and setting aside thereby the judgment and decree dated 1.8.89 passed by the learned District Judge, Noakhali in Title Appeal No. 105 of 1987 allowing the appeal and reversing the judgment and decree dated 4.3.87 passed in Title Suit No. 129 of 1985 by the learned Assistant Judge, Begumgonj Upazila who decreed the suit and declared that the temporary lease granted to defendant No. 1 (respondent No. 1 herein) by the Government in respect of 10 decimals of Government acquired land in Settlement Case No. 2014 of 1984-85 on 8.7.85 is illegal, void and not binding upon the plaintiffs.<br/> <br/>2. Plaintiff-respondent Nos.2 and 3 institut­ed the aforesaid suit stating, inter alia, that the disputed land originally belonged to Monu Miah who subsequently by a deed of gift dated 7.12.69 transferred the same to his sons Habibur Rahman and others and those donees by a registered deed dated 4.9.81 sold the same to the plaintiffs and since then the plaintiffs had been possessing the same by constructing tin shed thereon. The plaintiffs on 10.8.84 inducted defendant No. 1 into a dochala tinshed as their monthly tenant at a rental of Tk. 150/-. Later on she became an undesirable tenant and was asked to vacate the suit premises. Then defen­dant No. 1 in collusion with some employees of the Government got a collusive settlement of the suit land illegally to the prejudice of the plaintiffs. It was further alleged that the disput­ed land along with other land was acquired by the Government in 1941 for the purpose of establishing Noakhali District Head Quarters, but later on the plan was changed and the Government did not take over physical posses­sion of the said land. The plaintiffs' predeces­sors had continued in possession of the suit land till it was sold to the plaintiffs.<br/> <br/>3. Defendant No. 1 by filing a written state­ment and the present appellants by filing anoth­er written statement contested the suit denying the case of the plaintiffs. The common case of the defendants is that the suit land having been finally acquired as far back as in 1941, the plaintiff did not acquire any right, title and interest therein by virtue of their alleged pur­chase and they had no locus standi to maintain the present suit for declaration that the tempo­rary lease granted by the Government to defen­dant No. 1 is illegal.<br/> <br/>4. The trial court decreed the suit holding, inter alia, that although the Government had acquired the suit land in the year 1941 the phys­ical possession had been lying with the original owners and that defendant No. 1 entered into the suit land as a tenant under the plaintiffs and as such defendant Nos. 2-5 as the representative of the Government are not entitled to lease out the suit land on their sweet will to anybody.<br/> <br/>5. Upon an appeal, preferred by the present appellants, the court of appeal below reversed the decree of the trial court and dismissed the suit holding, inter alia, that the suit land on being acquired in the year 1941 having been vested in the Government it has a legal right to deal with the property including granting of temporary lease and as such the settlement granted to defendant no. 1 is legal and valid and that the plaintiffs had no legal right to induct defendant No. 1 as a monthly tenant in the suit premises which is an acquired land of the Government.<br/> <br/>6. Being aggrieved the plaintiffs preferred a revision in the High Court Division against the judgment and decree of the lower appellate court and by the impugned judgment and order, a learned Single Judge of the High Court Division upon making the Rule absolute set aside the decree of the lower appellate court and restored that of the trial court holding, inter alia, that in view of the provision of Section 16 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, the suit land having not been absolutely vested in the Government for not taking physical possession therein in accordance with law, the lower appel­late court acted illegally in dismissing the suit.<br/> <br/>7. Leave was granted to consider as to whether in the facts and circumstances of the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division was justified in considering Section 16 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and erred in holding that the suit land did not vest absolute­ly in the Government although it had been acquired in 194142 and that whether the High Court Division made out a third Case which was never urged by the plaintiffs in the courts below as to whether any award was prepared or not against acquisition of the land or for taking over possession of the land by the Government pursuant to its acquisition.<br/> <br/>8. Mr. Mahbubey Alam, learned Additional Attorney-General appearing for the appellants, submits that the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division upon total misconception of the plaintiffs case and by making out a third Case under Section 16 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 acted illegally in setting aside the decree of the lower appellate court and in decreeing the suit. The plaintiffs instituted the suit alleging, inter alia, that the Government had acquired the suit land. The plaintiffs being in possession are entitled to obtain lease in pref­erence to anybody else. As such the lease in question granted to defendant no. 1 by the Government is illegal and not binding upon the plaintiffs. The High Court Division made out a third case, he submits. Learned Additional Attorney-General further submits that the learned Judge of the High Court Division mis­directed himself in holding that the lower appel­late court did not reverse the finding of the trial court that defendant No. 1 is a monthly tenant under the plaintiffs. The lower appellant court he submits, clearly discussed the implication of the plaintiffs' case of inducting defendant No. 1 as tenant in the suit premises, which is admit­tedly a Government-acquired property and ulti­mately held that the question of monthly tenan­cy of defendant No. 1 in respect of the suit premises has little bearing on the suit itself.<br/> <br/>9. Mr. Sharifuddin Chaklader, learned Advocate-on-Record appearing for plaintiff-respondent Nos. 2 and 3 submits that in view of the policy of the Government notified vide Gazette Notification dated 8.3.95 published by the Ministry of Land, the plaintiffs were entitled to get settlement of unused acquired land in preference of defendant No. 1. The trial court was therefore justified in decreeing the suit. He further submits that even after the alleged acquisition the original owners were in contin­uous possession of the suit land. The learned Judge of the High Court Division was therefore justified in holding that the suit land was not vested absolutely in the Government in view of the provision of Section 16 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.<br/> <br/>10. Having considered the admitted facts that the suit land along with other lands had been acquired by the Government in 1941-42 for the purpose of setting up of Noakhali Sadar Head Quarters and that thereby the Government became its owner and that accordingly both R.S. and S.A. record have been prepared in the name of the Government, the lower appellate Court rightly held that the plaintiffs who have no right, title and interest in the suit land have also no locus standi to question the lease grant­ed by the Government of its khas land to defen­dant no. 1. The lower appellate court further held that in respect of the acquired land, the court cannot direct the Government to lease out the suit land to the plaintiffs simply because their predecessors-in-interest as the original owners had been in possession even after acqui­sition. It does not appear either from the judgment of the trial court or from the lower appel­late court that the plaintiffs had ever made out any case under Section 16 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, namely, that no award regarding compensation for acquisition of the land was prepared by the Government or that the original owners did not receive any com­pensation for acquisition in question, It appears that the learned Judge of the High Court Division upon making out a third case, on consideration of Section 16 of the said Act, has wrongly reversed the decree of the lower appel­lant court and decreed the suit wrongly holding, inter alia, that although the land had been acquired by the Government as far back as in 1941 the same did not absolutely vest in the Government free from all encumbrance because the Government did not take physical posses­sion thereof in pursuance of the acquisition in question. Moreover the learned Judge of the High Court Division was not justified in consid­ering the trial court's finding that defendant No. 1 is a monthly tenant in respect of the suit land, overlooking that the lower appellate court rightly held that the plaintiffs, who have no right, title and interest in the suit land, had no legal authority to induct defendant No. 1 as a monthly tenant in the suit land.<br/> <br/>Thus we find substance in this appeal. Accordingly it is allowed without any order as to cast.<br/> <br/>The impugned judgment of the High Court Division is set aside and the judgment and decree of the lower appellate court are restored.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
