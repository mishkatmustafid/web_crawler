The High Court Division while entertaining the contentions of the respective parties came to the conclusion that the respondent is a British Bangladeshi citizen. To my mind this aspect of the case calls for no decision inasmuch as, the moot question was whether the house in question was abandoned property. The learned Judges themselves have found that a non-national possessed property in this country and that has not been challenged by the Government. Hence the question was to the nature of the property of the respondent, namely, whether it was abandoned property or not. Since the entire gamut of P.O. 16 of 1972 had been examined thoroughly and X' Rayed by two authoritative decisions of this Court the least that can be said is that P.O. 16 is not attracted to the facts, of this case. There is no hesitation in saying that the property cannot be termed as an abandoned property. Respondent’s property is not abandoned property because he has neither acquired any citizenship of Pakistan nor has ceased to manage his property and his temporary absence is not prejudicial to the interest of the Country. The Government has not made out any such case either. Therefore, there is no hesitation in saying that the property in question of the respondent is not an abandoned property…….(26 &amp; 37)</strong><br/><br/><strong>If his habitual residence is in U.K. then his permanent residence is bound to be Dhaka, Bangladesh. Again, if his ordinary residence is taken as U.K. then again it is in Bangladesh which is to be taken as permanent residence because he owns a house and rent a flat and his mother lives here and his father is buried here. It is not by naked assertion but by deeds and acts that a domicile is established…………………(29)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Cases Referred to-</strong><br/>28 DLR (AD) 120; 30 DLR (SC) 101; AIR 1963 (SC) 1819; (1889) 14 App. Case 631 (636), 1928 A.C. 143 (164); (1942) 315 U.S. 262(L); 27 DLR 423; 27 DLR 551; M/s Khan Brothers Ltd.

Leave no appeal was granted to consider the only point of public importance as quoted below:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"For that the respondent or his father or grandfa­ther not having been born in the territories now comprising Bangladesh nor he being a perma­nent resident of such territories on this 25th day of March, 1971 nor he having continued to be so resident, Article 2 of P.O. No. 149 of 1972 was/is not applicable to him and as such Article 2A, as inserted by Act No. V of 1973 was/is also not applicable to him and therefore, the re­spondent cannot be deemed to be a citizen of Bangladesh within the meaning of the provi­sions of Articles <em>2 </em>and 2A of the President's Order No. 149 of 1972 and therefore, the property of abandoned property under Article 2(1)(i) of P.O. No.16 of 1972 and in the circumstances the learned Judges of the High Court Division erred in making the rule absolute upon an erro­neous construction of the relevant provisions of law referred to above."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>3. The crucial question is, whether the suit property is an abandoned property within the meaning of Abandoned Property (Control Management and Dis­posal) Order, 1972 (hereinafter referred to as the P.O. 16 of 1972). The main contention of the appel­lant, the Government, is that the respondent cannot be deemed to be a citizen of Bangladesh within the meaning of the provisions of Ankles 2 and 2A of the President's Order No. 149 of 1972. As such "it falls within the definition of abandoned property un­der Article 2(1) (i) of P.O. No. 16 of 1972".<br/> <br/>4. The respondent filed Writ petition against the order of the Government treating it as abandoned property. The fact that has emerged in the writ pro­ceedings are as follows: The respondent is the son of late Justice M. A. Ispahani, who retired as Chief Jus­tice of the Dhaka High Court and died in 1982 and was buried in Dhaka. The respondent was born in Calcutta on 17th September, 1941, His father mi­grated to the then East Pakistan in 1947 and settled in East Pakistan. His father at that time was Secre­tary, Ministry of Law and later became a High Court Judge.<br/> <br/>5. In 1952 he was sent to England with an International passport issued from Dhaka by the then Government of Pakistan and his permanent address was given at Dhaka. His passport was renewed in 1963 by the Pakistan High Commissioner in London.<br/> <br/>6. In 1962 he was allotted a piece of land by the D.I.T. and he constructed a double stored house with his own earnings in England as a Chartered Accountant rented it to the Deputy High Commissioner for Britain for Dhaka on monthly rent. His mother and father and family live in Dhaka in the Ispahani Colony and he himself rented a flat being flat No. 2 in Ispahani Colony at Dhaka. He exercised all manner and acts of ownership and possession in respect of the disputed house and went on paying ground rent, municipal tax and urban tax. He paid income tax on the rental income of the house by a chalan dated 29.11.72 for the year 1972-73. He paid Finance Tax on 13.1.71, ground rent on 20.9.71, Urban tax for the year 1972-73 from 12.4.73 and Municipal tax for the year 1973-74 on 13.3.74. He emphasised in his representation annexure-L that during the period of 20 years between 1952 and 1972 he paid number of visits to Dhaka for visiting his parents and relations and he did never visit any place in West Pakistan. He had no place of residence or dwelling house in Pakistan. Only on one occasion in 1970 he broke his journey at Karachi as a transit passenger. He was shocked to know that the Government considered his property as abandoned property in the last part of 1972. Though he paid all taxes, dues and even Fire Insurance upto 1974.<br/> <br/>7. His only passport was one that was issued in 1952 from Dhaka by the Government of Pakistan and that was renewed from lime to time. In that passport East Pakistan was the domicile of the respondent, after liberation he surrendered his Pakistani passport and applied for British passport on 28.2.72. This date is crucial because on that date P.O. 16 of 1972 was promulgated. We shall revert to this point at a later stage. To complete narration of facts, he obtained British Passport on 14.4.72 and the same is valid up to 1972. His mother is still alive. She made various representations to the Government and even to the President (Annexure-N) for releasing the house from the list of the abandoned property and finally the Government by order dated 4.2.85 refused to release the property, whereupon the respondent filed writ pe­tition.<br/> <br/>8. In paragraph 3 it was stated "while the peti­tioner was domiciled in the Province of East Paki­stan and continued to reside at Dhaka as a permanent resident of that Province, he was sent to England by his father in August, 1952 on a Pakistan Internation­al Passport issued at Dhaka for receiving education there. Subsequently, his passport was renewed in the year 1963 from the office of the High Commissioner of Pakistan in London with permanent address at Dhaka............... The petitioner visit­ed Dhaka from time to time where his parents were permanently settled."<br/> <br/>9. In a very vague manner the Government at­tempted to controvert the statement by saying that the respondent "is required to prove his other asser­tions as made in those paragraphs". It was not denied that it was a Pakistani Passport showing his domi­cile as East Pakistan and the same was renewed from time to time and it was only surrendered on 28.2.72 when he applied for British Passport. Hence on the 25th March, 1971 his domiciles was the same, namely, the then East Pakistan and by obtaining a British Passport the longest that could be said that he acquired a dual nationality as permissible by law.<br/> <br/>10. The High Court Division noticed the cir­cumstances of the case and observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"That the petitioner has a residence at Dhaka, that he looked after his properties effectively upto 1974 that he obtained an international Pa­kistani passport in 1952 from Dhaka, that he paid income tax etc., are all verifiable facts at Dhaka itself and those facts were brought to the notice of the respondent long before the writ pe­tition was filed. The respondent did not inquire into those assertions and has not come up with alternative facts suggesting that after 25.3.71 the petitioner retained his Pakistani citizenship or subsequently acquired Pakistani citizenship.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>As the disputed property has been claimed to be an abandoned property solely on the basis that the petitioner was a citizen of Pakistan after the 25th day of March, 1971, there cannot be any escape from the consequences that follow from the citizenship laws of Bangladesh. If by the citizenship laws of Bangladesh the petitioner is deemed to be a resident in Bangladesh on and after the 25th day of March, 1971, then his Ban­gladeshi citizenship was not lost at any time, even though he may not have applied for a Ban­gladeshi passport, for citizenship and acquisition of passport are not synonymous."<br/> <br/>11. He got the British Passport on 14.4.72. This is valid upto 13.5.92. In the back ground of these facts his house has been treated as abandoned property. His representation to the Government had already been noticed (annexure-L).<br/> <br/>12. Now the first question is whether the house in question can be treated as abandoned property. The definition of abandoned property can be found in Ar­ticle 2 of the President's Order (P.O. 16 of 1972). It is as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"2. In this order, unless there is anything re­pugnant in the subject or context,-<br/>(1) 'abandoned property' means any property owned by any person who is not present in Ban­gladesh or whose whereabouts are not known or who has ceased to occupy, supervise or manage in person his property, including-<br/>(i) any property owned by any person who is a citizen of a State which at any time after the 25th day of March, 1971 was at war with or en­gaged in military operations against the Peo­ple's Republic of Bangladesh;<br/>(ii) any property taken over under the Bangla­desh Taking over of Control and Management of Industrial and Commercial Concerns Order, 1972 (Acting President's Order No. 1 of 1972) but does not include<br/>(a) any property the owner of which is residing outside Bangladesh for any purpose which in the opinion of the Government is not prejudicial to the interest of Bangladesh.<br/>(b) any property which is in the possession or under the control of the Government under any law for the time being in force.<br/><br/><strong>Explanation.-</strong> "Person who is not-present in Bangladesh" in­cludes any body of persons or company constitut­ed or incorporated in the territory or under the laws of State which at any lime after the 25th day of March, 1971, was at war with or engaged in military operations against the People's Re­public of Bangladesh."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It was in the case of <em><strong>M/s Khan Brs. Ltd., Vs. Govt of Bangladesh 27 DLR 423</strong></em><strong> a</strong> Division Bench considered the definition and observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"The defination given is not a very clear lan­guage. The legislative authority has tried first to define "abandoned property' then gave it an inclu­sive meaning, and then again excluded certain cat­egories of properties. We will deal with the defi­nition portion presently. Let us first refer to those properties which have been included and those excluded. Of the included properties are: (1) properties owned by any person who is a citizen of the State at war with the People's Republic of Bangladesh at any time after 25th day of March, 1971 which in short means West Pakistan, now Pakistan; (2) any property taken over under Act­ing President's Order No. 1/72."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The excluded properties are:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"(1) any property whose owner is residing outside Bangladesh for any purpose which in the opinion of the Government is not prejudicial to the interest of Bangladesh;<br/>(2) any property which is in possession of the Government under any law for the time being in force."<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Then the definition was fully considered and it was observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"In our opinion the legislative authority while defining 'abandoned property' has used a complex sentence containing a principal clause, and two subordinate clauses. The two subordinate clauses on the principal clause, though they themselves are disjunctive. The principal clause denotes persons, and the subordinate clauses connote contentions under which property of the denoted persons will become abandoned property.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The court then considered the explanation and observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The explanation in our opinion gives a clue to the interpretation we are trying to give to the definition clause contained in sub-article (1). The legislative authority has gone on the basis of clauses, and not on the basis of words taken sep­arately. The legislative authority has taken whole clause <em>viz.</em> the principal clause of sub-article (1) to for explanation. Giving its grammatical mean­ing, we find that 'abandoned property' will be that property whose owner, either natural or arti­ficial person like corporation, is not present in Bangladesh. That is the first precondition, but not the whole inasmuch as the principal clause is qualified by two subordinate but alternative clauses. The first precondition of absence from Bangladesh must be added with any of the two at­tributes contained in the alternative subordinate clauses. The other precondition is alternative; one is whose whereabouts are not known, and the other, who has ceased to occupy or manage or supervise this property. And when both the preconditions of the principal and subordinate clauses though alternative, are present, then the property will bear answer to the definition of abandoned property."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In that case on the facts it was observed also:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"Not the properties of all persons living out­side Bangladesh are abandoned properties, if the Government is of opinion that their stay abroad is not prejudicial to the interest of Bangladesh."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>That was the first case in which this definition of abandoned property was considered. <em><strong>(K. Hossain &amp; B.H. Chowdhury, JJ).</strong></em><br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong> In the case of <em><strong>M/s. Helal Jute Press Ltd. Vs. Govt. of Bangladesh 27 DLR 551 </strong></em><strong>it</strong> was found that the petitioner though was absent from Bangla­desh his property should not be taken as abandoned property. It was observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"The petitioner No. 2 instead of opting for Pakistan left Bangladesh temporarily and lived in India."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The Court then observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"The provisions of Article 2(1) including clause (II)(a) of P. O. 16 of 1972 read together would reasonably mean that the mischief of this law shall not be applicable to such persons who were away from Bangladesh for a tempo­rary period not prejudicial to the interest of Bangladesh. Otherwise in a restricted sense it would mean that anyone who might be away from Bangladesh temporarily would come within the mischief of this law and the properties thereof might be declared as abandoned proper­ty. It is not possible to presume that legislature had intended that any one who was absent from Bangladesh temporarily being not prejudicial to the interest of Bangladesh, would be coming within the mischief of the President's Order No. 16 of 1972 and the properties thereof will be taken as abandoned property." (<strong>Fazle Munim &amp; S. M. Hussain JJ</strong>).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>14. The Appellate Division then gave authorit­ative pronouncement oh the question as to the meaning of the "abandoned property." In the case of <em><strong>Government of Bangladesh Vs. Messrs. A.T.J. In­dustries Ltd. and others 28 DLR (AD) 120</strong></em> it was observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"On the first question, a reference to the language of Article 2(1) set out above indicates that the language is not free from ambiguity. It appears that the legislative authority has em­ployed multiple systems in the definition. It has first defined with denotation and connotation the words abandoned property' and then has em­ployed an inclusive definition, and then an ex­clusion clause. It has also added an explanation. Interpretation of the definition of clause no doubt creates some complexity. The best way to interpret it is to give a harmonious meaning to all the clauses of Article 2(1) so that each clause gets its own meaning and at the same time har­monises with the meaning of the whole. The de­fining part denotes property owned by a person who is either not present in Bangladesh, or whose whereabouts are not known, or who has ceased to occupy, supervise or manage in person his property. A question may arise whether the three sub-clauses are disjunctive or conjunctive. We think they have been used disjunctively and there is no need to construe them conjunctively.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Then comes the inclusive definition. In the inclusive definition is included two calories of property, first is the properly owned by a person who is a citizen of a State which after 25th day of March, 1971 either is at war or engaged in military operation against Bangladesh; the sec­ond is the property taken over by the Govern­ment under Acting President's Order No.1 of 1971. So far as the inclusion clause is concerned both the categories of properties come within the meaning of the definition of abandoned prop­erty."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Then is the exclusion clause. The first ques­tion which arises is whether the exclusion clause qualifies the inclusion clause. Except for the fact that the exclusion clause follows the inclusion clause, there is nothing in the grammatical con­struction of the whole clause to indicate that it qualifies the inclusion clause. Exclusion clause contemplates two categories of property. The first is the property the owner of which is resid­ing outside Bangladesh for any purpose which in the opinion of the Government is not prejudicial to the interest of Bangladesh. The second is the property which is in possession or under the control of the Government under any law in force for the time being. The second part of this exclusion clause needs no classification for the purpose of this appeal. The first part of the ex-, elusion clause is not only an exception but it qualifies the definition clause and this qualifica­tion is such that it is implicit with the defini­tion and ah integral part of it. Definition clause cannot be conceived without this implicit qual­ification. What then is the qualification? <u>The sub-clause says that if the residence of the own­er of a property outside Bangladesh is in the opinion of the Government for a purpose not Prejudicial to the interest of the State, then the property is not an abandoned property.</u> In this sub-clause the condition is such that the opera­tion of the definition clause will come into ef­fect only when the Government formed its opinion. The definition clause with inclusion and exclusion clauses have been so framed that we do not find any other reasonable construc­tion to bestow on entire clause of Article 2(1) than we have given. On the formation of opin­ion of the Government the definition clause comes into operation, but once opinion has been formed the law takes effect from 28.1.72" the day President's Order No. 17 of 1972 was promulgated. The Government is to form its <u>opinion on the events as they stood on 28.2.72."</u> (emphasis added)<br/> <br/>The Appellate Division further considered that Article 2(1) of P. O. 16 of 1972 reveals that forma­tion of opinion by the Government is implicit in the determination of a property as an abandoned properly. It was observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"No doubt this determination is only an ascertainment of fact constituting a property an abandoned property, and on such preliminary ascertainment of fact the law takes effect of its own force from 28.2.72 the date the Order came into force. On such formation of opinion of the Government after ascertainment of fact the property as abandoned property vests in the Government under Article 4, subject to the pro­visions of other articles of the Presidential Or­der. Preliminary formation of opinion of the Government is, however, not necessary for the properties coming within the ambit of the two categories included in the inclusion clause. Mr Attorney-General's contention that no forma­tion of opinion by the Government is necessary under Article 2(1) for coming into operation of the definition clause under Article 4 the sustained. The High Court Division t in this part of its finding."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>15. Then in the case of <em><strong>Bangladesh and others Vs. M/s Speedbird Navigation Co., and others 30 DLR (SC) 101 </strong></em>the Court reiterated the view that Liken earlier as to the meaning of the expression of the abandoned property. It was viewed that only because K.P. Mahmud was away from the country, his property could not be treated as abandoned property. The moot question was in that whether the Government had formed an opinion as to purpose of his absence and it was observed. “In the absence of such an opinion the property of an absentee owner cannot be regarded as abandoned property." It was observed further "On the formation of opinion of the Government the definition clause comes into operation, but once opinion has been formed the law takes effect from 28.2.72 the day President's Order No. 16 of 1972 was promulgated. The Government is to form its opinion on the events as they stood on 28.2.72."<br/> <br/>16. Applying the principles it should have been enough to dispose of the appeal by affirming the High Court Division's view that the property in question of the respondent was not an abandoned property. But arguments were taken on different level, namely, on the question of status of the peti­tioner and it was argued that since the petitioner was not a permanent resident, Article 2 of P.O. 149 of 1972 was applicable and consequently he could not come within Article 2(a) as inserted by Act 5 of 1972 and therefore the appellant could not be deemed to be a citizen of Bangladesh and his proper­ty comes within the definition of P.O. 16 of 1972. Leave was granted only on this point. The ground that has been formulated has been quoted above which in final analysis appears to be a rambling way by making a proposition of law for depriving a person of his property. The argument involves <em>fal­lacy of petitio principi</em> because it tends to beg the question and found a conclusion on a basis that as-much needs to be proved as the conclusion.<br/> <br/>17. Before we proceed further it will be con­venient to consider P.O. 149 of 1972. The entire Provision of P.O. 149 of 1972 needs to be quoted:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong>President's Order No. 149 of 1972</strong><br/> <br/>The Bangladesh Citizenship (Temporary Provisions Order, 1972.<br/>Whereas it is expedient to make temporary Provisions regarding citizenship of Bangladesh<br/>Now, therefore, in pursuance of the Proclama­tion of Independence of Bangladesh, read with the Provisional Constitution of Bangladesh Order, 1972, and in exercise of all powers enabling him in that behalf, the President is pleased to make the follow­ing order :-<br/> <br/>1. (1) This Order may be called the Ban­gladesh Citizenship (Temporary Provisions) Or­der, 1972.<br/>(2) It shall come into force at once and shall be deemed to have taken effect on the 26th day of March, 1971.<br/> <br/>2. Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law on the commencement of this Order, every person shall be deemed to be a citi­zen of Bangladesh-<br/>(i) who or whose father or grandfather was born in the territories now comprised in Bangladesh and who was a permanent resident of such territories on the 25th day of March, 1971, and continues to be so res­ident, or<br/>(ii) who was a permanent resident of the territories now comprised in Bangladesh on the 25th day of March, 1971, and con­tinues to be so resident and is not otherwise disqualified for being a citizen by or under any law for the time being in force:<br/>Provided that if any person is a permanent resident of the territories now comprised in Bangladesh or his dependent is, in the course of his employment or for the pursuit of his studies residing in a country which was at war with, or engaged in military op­erations against Bangladesh and is being pre­vented from returning to Bangladesh, such person, or his dependents, shall be deemed to continue to be resident in Bangladesh.<br/> <br/>2A. A person to whom Article 2 would have ordinarily applied but for his residence in the United Kingdom shall be deemed to continue to be permanent resident in Bangla­desh within the meaning of that Article:<br/>Provided that the Government may noti­fy in the Official Gazette, any person or cat­egories of persons to whom this Article shall not apply.<br/> <br/>2B. (i) Notwithstanding anything con­tained in Article 2 or in any other law for the time being in force, a person shall not, except as provided in clause (2), qualify him­self to be a citizen of Bangladesh, if he-<br/>(i) owes, affirm or acknowledge, ex­pressly or by conduct, allegiance to <em>a </em>foreign state, or<br/>(ii) is notified under the proviso to Ar­ticle 2A:<br/>Provided that a citizen of Bangladesh shall not, merely by reason of being a citi­zen or acquiring citizenship of a state speci­fied in or under clause (2), cease to be a citi­zen of Bangladesh,<br/>(2) The Government may grant citizen­ship of Bangladesh to any person who is a citizen of any state of Europe or North America or of any other state which the Government may, by notification in the of­ficial Gazette, specify in this behalf.<br/>3.

The Government may make rules for carrying out the purposes of the Order.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>18. The respondent although mentioned that his father was a Judge of the Dhaka High Court and retired as a Chief Justice and then died in Dhaka in 1982. This fact has not been disputed. Again the re­spondent mentioned that he was sent abroad while he was a boy of 11 for higher studies to U.K. and traveled on a Pakistani passport at Dhaka showing his permanent residence at Dhaka. He, therefore, con­tended that by Article (2) (ii) he shall be deemed to be a citizen of Bangladesh, inasmuch as, he was a permanent resident of the territories "now comprised in Bangladesh on the 25th day of March, 1971." He further contended that the legislature took the cases of the persons who arc resident of United Kingdom to whom Article 2 would have ordinarily applied but for his residence in the United Kingdom and such persons shall be deemed to continue to be a perma­nent resident. He has not affirmed or acknowledged allegiance to any country which is at war with Ban­gladesh, in other words Pakistan, nor in his case the Government had notified him as a person to whom Article 2(A) shall not apply. It has further pointed out that by the proviso to Article 2B even by reason of being a citizen or acquiring citizenship of any state mentioned in 2B (2) such person shall not cease to be a citizen of Bangladesh (namely, the State of Europe or North America or of any other slate which the Government may notify, <em>vide </em>Ordinance No.VII of 1978). This provision has been substituted in Ar­ticle 2. P.O. 149 of 1972 had been given retrospec­tive effect though it was promulgated on 15.12.72 and it says "shall be deemed to have taken effect on the 26th day of March, 1971."<br/> <br/>19. The learned Additional Attorney General argued that since he was not a permanent resident of the territories comprising in Bangladesh on the 25th of March, 1971 he cannot be deemed as a citizen of Bangladesh. The argument is mis-conceived, inasmuch as, Article 3 pointedly says in case of whether a person is qualified to be a citizen of Bangladesh under Article 2 of this Order the be decided by the Government whose decision shall be final.<br/> <br/>20. The Government at no stage was called upon to express its view on Article 3. It was not a nationality of the respondent that was at issue. Citizenship is a creature solely of domestic law. It refers to right which a state sees fit to confer upon certain individuals who are also its nationals. See State Trading Corporations’ case in A.I.R. 1963 (SC) 1819 for a fuller discussion. Citizens are those persons who have full political rights and are still domiciled in that country.<br/> <br/>21. The question was whether his property is abandoned property. Since there is a specific law as 3c the definition and meaning of abandoned property, namely, P.O. 16 of 1972 there is no scope for taking round about course for saddling the person with a liability that since he is not a permanent resident his property must be abandoned property. What is meant by definition? It means essentially to bring a given t with a more comprehensive concept.<br/> <br/>22. The learned Additional Attorney-General could not dispute that a non-citizen can own property in this country and unless he comes within the defi­nition clause his property cannot be taken as aban­doned property. 'Residence' or 'permanent residence' both expressions have been used in P.O. 149 of 1972. In 2(ii) it is the permanent resident that was contem­plated in contra-distinction of persons whose resi­dence was in U.K. The respondent's mother and fami­ly are residing in Dhaka, apart from the house in question he has rented a flat in the Ispahani colony. He works in the United Kingdom as a Chartered Ac­countant. Even in proviso added in Article 2 those persons residing in Pakistan but had been stranded shall be deemed to continue to be resident in Bangla­desh.<br/> <br/>P.O. 16 of 1972 adds an explanation:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"Person who is not present in Bangladesh includes any body of persons or company con­stituted or incorporated in the territory or under the laws of a State which at any time after the 25th day of March, 1971, was at war with or engaged in military operation against the Peo­ple's Republic of Bangladesh."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Obviously the reference is to Pakistan and not United Kingdom.<br/> <br/>23. Next question whether the property is owned by the respondent would come within the abandoned property. It does not come within the Clause (I) of Article 2 because he does not come with the expression "person who is not present in Bangladesh," nor it is the case that his whereabouts are not known, nor can it be said he has ceased to occupy, supervise or manage in person his property because payment of rates and taxes in the years 1971-72, 1972-73, and 1973-74 are amply proved to justify his contention that he does not come within the clause 2(i).<br/> <br/>24. The next question is whether he will come within the Clause (i) "any properly owned by any person who is a citizen of a State which at any time after the 25th day of March, 1971, was at war with or engaged in military operations against the Peo­ple's Republic of Bangladesh." P.O. 16 of 1972 was promulgated on 28th February, 1972 and the autho­ritative pronouncement of the Appellate Division in two cases 28 DLR and 30 DLR that the date of for­mation of the opinion is this date, namely, 28.2.72. What was the position on that date? It has been substantiated that on that very date he surrendered his Pakistani Passport to the British Home Office for obtaining British Passport, which he did in fact received on 14.4.72. Hence on that date he surrendered the Pakistani passport, the one that he obtained from Dhaka which was renewed from time to time by the High Commissioner in England. Thus he severed all connection whatever it meant for possessing a passport issued by Government of Pakistan.<br/> <br/>25. Next Article 2(B) has provided" a citizen of Bangladesh shall not merely by reason of being a cit­izen or acquiring citizenship of a State specified in or under Clause (2) cease to be a citizen of Bangladesh." Clause 2 runs as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"The Government may grant citizenship of Bangladesh to any person who is a citizen of any state of Europe or North America or of any other state which the Government may, by notifica­tion in the official Gazette, specify in this behalf."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In other words it has provided for dual nationali­ty. It is recognised for private international law by many countries. This aspect of the case should not detain us for the disposal of this appeal because if there is any doubt as to a person whether he is quali­fied to be deemed to be a citizen of Bangladesh the question shall be decided by the Government, which decision shall be, the final (<em>vide</em> Art 3).<br/> <br/>26. The impugned order was issued under P.O. 16 of 1972 treating the property of the respondent as abandoned property. The High Court Division while entertaining the contentions of the respective parties came to the conclusion that the respondent is a Brit­ish Bangladeshi citizen. To my mind this aspect of the case calls for no decision inasmuch as, the moot question was whether the house in question was abandoned property. The learned Judges themselves have found that a non-national possessed property in this country and that has not been challenged by the Government. Hence the question was to the nature of the property of the respondent, namely, whether it was abandoned property or not. Since the entire ga­mut of P.O. 16 of 1972 had been examined thor­oughly and X' Rayed by two authoritative decisions of this Court the least that can be said is that P.O. 16 is not attracted to the facts, of this case. There is no hesitation in saying that the property cannot be termed as an abandoned property.<br/> <br/>27. Leave was given for meeting the argument on the basis of P.O. 149 of 1972. In other words if even the provision of P.O. 16 do not apply whether the Provision of P.O. 149 of 1972 are attracted to make the respondent first a non-national, inasmuch as, he was not a permanent resident of Bangladesh and then his residence in U.K. was taken as permanent residence. This approach is erroneous because in P.O. 149 both the concept had been kept in view by the legislature e.g. permanent residence and residence.<br/> <br/>28. The Courts have given divergent views on cases as to the meaning 'permanent resident', 'habitual resident' and 'ordinary resident'. Professor Cheshire says "this is due to the over scrupulous manner in which the Courts attempt to discover a man's exact intention. (Private International Law P. 172 (9th ed). The Private International Law had not fixed any defi­nite criteria to look at the permanent residence and or­dinary residence of a person. 25 years' residence in In­dia was not sufficient to acquire Indian domicile be­cause of his alleged intention to return to Scotland, the land of his birth <em><strong>(Jopp. Vs. Jopp).</strong></em><br/> <br/>29. In such state of various concept of the law of domicile the safest course that has been suggested is what the man himself is and what he intended to do. As we have seen that the respondent is the son of a person who retired as Judge of the Dhaka High Court and died in 1982 and his mother still living and residing at Dhaka and he himself rented a flat apart from his own house which is in dispute now. He is a qualified Chartered Accountant eking out a living in U.K. and it is by his own earning he obtained a plot from DIT and built his house and rented it to a For­eign Mission. He himself visits Dhaka occasionally which is his permanent residence. His ordinary resi­dence or for that matter his habitual residence as un­derstood in Europe is in U.K. If his habitual resi­dence in U.K. then his permanent residence is bound to be Dhaka, Bangladesh. Again if his ordinary resi­dence is taken as U.K. then again it is in Bangladesh which is to be taken as permanent residence because he owns a house and rent a flat and his mother lives here and his father is buried here. It is not by naked assertion but by deeds and acts that a domicile is esta­blished (<em><strong>McMullen vs. Wadsworth (1889) 14 App. Case 631 (636).</strong></em><br/> <br/>30. The appellant, the Government, in this case had not gone as far as that to pass any order under Ar­ticle 3, in other words whether he is qualified to be deemed to be a citizen of Bangladesh has not been doubted.<br/> <br/>31. The law of abandoned property is a stringent law no doubt, but as has been noticed in <em><strong>28 DLR </strong></em>and<em><strong> 30 DLR (AD)</strong></em> the definition contains the clause on ex­clusion and inclusion. One thing is very well settled that no person shall be deprived of his life and proper­ty unless it comes within the clear provision of law itself. He cannot be deprived of his property by falla­cious approach nor by provisions of enactment which merely by sidewind points a finger to such property. To be taken away of any property it must be shown that his property has come within the mischief of law clearly. There is no doubt that when the Act itself pro­vides a dictionary for the words used, we must look into the dictionary first for an interpretation of the words used in the statute. The court is not concerned with any presumed intention of the legislature — its task is to get at the intention as expressed in the stat­ue. Therefrom we examined the language of the definition to see if the ordinary accepted notion of abandoned property fits in with the language used. Why this law when it was promulgated become a relevant point. As <strong>Lord Atkinson</strong> pointed out in his speech in <strong><em>1928 A.C. 143 (at P. 164)</em></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"An Act of parliament does not alter the law by merely betraying an erroneous opinion of it."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In American jurisdiction it has been said:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"We are not limited to the lifeless words of the statute and formalistic canons of construction in our search of the intent of the Congress and in construing a statute, we may with propriety record to the history of times when it was passed (1942) 315 U.S. 262(L).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>32. P.O. 16 was promulgated on 28.2.72 immediately after emergence of Bangladesh as an inde­pendent nation. Hundreds of West Pakistani industri­al/business entrepreneurs had left the country. Mills, factories, establishments etc., had been abandoned for which specific law was promulgated. Such ab­sentee owners had left their assets properties e.g. houses, buildings etc. Such property was the subject matter of P.O. 16 and the definition has been given in the P.O. itself. For the present case Art. 2(1) is to be understood in the light of 1(ii)(a).<br/> <br/>33. The argument of the learned Additional At­torney General runs thus:<br/>(i) that he or his father was not born in Bangladesh<br/>(ii) he is not a permanent resident nor did he continue to be a permanent resident of Bangla­desh<br/>- Therefore Art. 2 and 2A are not applicable in his case.<br/>- Therefore he cannot be deemed as a cit­izen of Bangladesh.<br/>- Therefore his property is abandoned prop­erty.<br/> <br/>34. In logic two premises can lead to a neces­sary conclusion that follow from them. Here two, if not, three conclusions are based on two premises. While the premise (ii) is based on Art. 2(ii) it fails to take note that the article itself is to be read as a whole and the question "he is not otherwise disquali­fied for being a citizen" can only be decided by Art. 3 which says in case of doubt as to whether a person is qualified to be deemed to be a citizen of Bangla­desh under Art. 1, "it will be decided by the Govern­ment." The third conclusion is alien to the P.O. 149 which says "it is expedient to make temporary pro­visions regarding citizenship of Bangladesh." This subject is covered by P.O. 16" for control, manage­ment and disposal of certain property abandoned by certain persons who are not present in Bangladesh or whose whereabouts are not known or who have ceased to occupy, supervise or manage in person their property or who are enemy aliens."<br/> <br/>35. The argument is obviously fallacious be­cause it tends to beg the question and attempts to find a conclusion which itself needs to be established as a premise to lead to a conclusion that since he cannot be deemed to be a citizen of Bangladesh his property must be abandoned property-as if the con­clusion follows necessarily. For instance glass is transparent because we see through it. This is fallacy of <em>petitio principi</em>.<br/> <br/>36. It has been noticed that non-citizen can own property and that has not been disputed. The line of argument is illogical because the line of reasoning is somewhat like this: after this, therefore because of this— a fallacious reasoning known in Latin post hoc, ergo propter hoc. For example: A died after his visit to Quetta. Therefore his visit to Quetta was the cause of his death. This is obviously fallacious.<br/> <br/>37. To put it simply: respondent's property is not abandoned property because he has neither ac­quired any citizenship of Pakistan nor has ceased to manage his property and his temporary absence is not prejudicial to the interest of the Country. The Government has not made out any such case either. Therefore, there is no hesitation in saying that the property in question of the respondent is not an aban­doned property.<br/> <br/>38. In the result, therefore, this appeal is dis­missed. There will be no order as to costs.<br/><strong>Shahabuddin Ahmed J.-</strong> I have gone through the judgments proposed to be delivered by my learned brothers, <strong>Badrul Haider Chowdhury and M.H. Rahman JJ;</strong> I agree with the judgment of my brother <strong>Badrul Haider Chowdhury J,</strong> and would add the following words of my own: Government de­clared the respondent's property an "abandoned prop­erty", and as such, onus lies upon the Government to bring it within the ambit of 'enemy property' as de­fined in Article 2 of President's Order No. 16 of 1976, which has been already quoted. The main part of the definition does not bring the respondent's property within its scope, but it is sought to be included ther­ein by virtue of the Inclusion part of the definition. The Inclusion part says that 'abandoned property in­cludes "any property owned by any person who is a citizen of a State which at any lime after 25 March 1971, was at war with Bangladesh"- that is, Paki­stan. Purpose of this Inclusion-clause is that whether or not a property is covered by the main definition, it shall be treated as such if its owner is a Pakistani. Respondent, as has been shown in the judgment of my learned brother <strong>B.H. Chowdhury J</strong>, is not a per­son whose property falls within the main definition. So the only way to treat his property as 'abandoned property' is to brand him as a citizen of Pakistan, for once a person is found to be a Pakistani citizen, his property shall be necessarily an "abandoned proper­ty", wherever he may be.<br/> <br/>40. President's Order No. 149 of 1972 provides for citizenship of Bangladesh. Article 2 thereof pro­vides that every person shall be deemed to be a citi­zen of Bangladesh:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"(i) who or whose father or grandfather was born in the territories now comprised in Bangla­desh and who was a permanent resident of such territories on the 25th day of March, 1971, and continues to be so resident; or,<br/>(ii) who was a permanent resident of the ter­ritories now comprised in Bangladesh on the 25th day of March, 1971, and continues to be so resident and is not otherwise disqualified for be­ing a citizen by or under any law for the time being in force."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Respondent does not come under clause (i) of Article 2, but his case is that he comes under clause (ii) in view of the fact that he was a permanent resi­dent "of the territories now comprised in Bangladesh" on the 25 March, 1971 and continued to be so. From before 25 March 1971 he had been residing in U. K, first for study, then for the purpose of professional work. He did not physically continue to reside in Bangladesh but on the strength of Article 2A of President's Order No. 149 of 1972, in spite of his residence in the U.K. "he shall be deemed to contin­ue to be permanent resident of Bangladesh". If he is a Bangladeshi citizen he cannot be a citizen of Paki­stan at the same time; he may, however, be a citizen of Bangladesh and U. K. at the same time.<br/> <br/>41. But the learned Additional Attorney-General has disputed his claim that he "was a permanent resident of Bangladesh" on 25 March <em>1911</em><em>. </em>If the respondent was not a permanent resident of Ban­gladesh on that crucial date, Article 2A will, of course, not apply to his case and he will not be a citizen of Bangladesh. Respondent has however led evidence to show that he was a permanent resident of Bangladesh on that crucial date including the un­challenged evidence that he has got a house in Dha­ka which he has been maintaining all-through, that his parents were residing in Dhaka since 1947 and his father also died there in 1982, that his mother is still residing in Dhaka and further that he got no house or property in Pakistan nor did he ever visit Pakistan except only on one occasion when he passed through Karachi Air Port as a transit passen­ger. The learned Additional Attorney General, when asked by us what materials he got to show that the respondent acquired Pakistani citizenship at any time from 26 March 1971 till 28 February 1972 when he surrendered his Pakistani Passport to the British Government, replied that as the respondent, who was not residing in Bangladesh on 25 March 1971, did not since then take any step towards becoming a Bangladeshi citizen, it must be presumed that he continued his Pakistani citizenship when he was re­siding in U.K. This argument runs counter to the express provisions of law, namely Article 2(ii), which provides for automatic citizenship of Bangla­desh, and Article 2A, which maintains the continui­ty of his residence in Bangladesh, though physically he was in U.K. There is therefore no scope for pre­suming that he continued to be a citizen of Pakistan after 25 March 1971.<br/> <br/><strong><u>M.H. Rahman J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>I think the appeal should be allowed.<br/> <br/>The Government of Bangladesh has been treat­ing the respondent's property, 'Lismore Court' on plot No.NE (G)-II, Municipal holding No.7, Road No. 75, Gulshan, Dhaka, as an abandoned property since 1972. As the Government refused to release that property from the list of abandoned properties the respondent filed, through his mother and consti­tuted attorney, Writ Petition No. 12 of 1985 in the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>43. The respondent's case is that he was born in Calcutta on 17th September, 1941. He came to Dhaka with his parents after the partition of India. His par­ents permanently settled at Dhaka. His father, <strong>Mr. Justice M. A Ispahani</strong>, retired as the Chief Justice of the High Court of East Pakistan and died in Dhaka in 1982. For his education the respondent was sent to England in August, 1952 on an International Pakista­ni Passport. That passport was renewed in 1963 from the Office of the High Commissioner of Pakistan in London. In that passport, Dhaka was given as his per­manent address. The respondent became a Chartered Accountant and continued to reside in London. With his own earnings in England he acquired a plot of land from the Dhaka Improvement Trust in 1962. In the lease deed his address was given: C/o. Prince Simon &amp; Co. Palmerston House, Bishopsgar, London, E.C.2. The respondent constructed the house in ques­tion and let it out to the British High Commission at Dhaka. During his long stay in England he made oc­casional visits to Dhaka for brief periods. He never visited the territories that comprise in present Paki­stan, except breaking a journey in Karachi as a transit passenger in January, 1970. He applied for a British passport on 28lh February, 1972 and obtained one on 14th April, 1972. He surrendered through the British Home Office his Pakistani passport to the Embassy of Pakistan in London. He applied for citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies on 28th February, 1972 and was granted citizenship on 6th April, 1972. He came to Dhaka from London on 13th October, 1972. He paid taxes and Municipal dues for his prop­erty. He left for London towards the end of October, 1972. His property was treated as an abandoned prop­erty from the end of 1972. The authority concerned went on accepting taxes and other dues from the re­spondent upto 1974. The respondent maintained an apartment, Flat No. 2, in Ispahani Mansion, Ispahani Colony Dhaka. He annexed different-kinds of tax-­receipts to his writ petition in support of his assertion that he never ceased to supervise or manage the prop­erty in question. Most of the tax-receipts were ad­dressed to C/o. S.M. Husain, Advocate, 81, Dhanmandi Residential Area, Road No. 6, Dhaka-5.<br/> <br/>44. In October, 1977 the respondent's mother, Mrs. Monirea Rashti Ispahani wrote to the Govern­ment expressing her surprise how "Lismore Court," the property of her son, a British national, who had been residing in U.K. since 1952, could be taken over as an abandoned property. She asked for the full amount of rent that was deposited with the Govern­ment. On 15th December, 1977 Mr. Rizvi, the re­spondent's representative, sent a Photostat of the na­tionality certificate to the appellant. On being asked by the Government to supply documentary proof of respondent's stay during the period from 23rd March, 1971 to 16th December, 1971and his national status at that time, Mr. Rizvi informed the Government on. March 18, 1978 that he had already submitted the doc­umentary proof of the respondent's stay in the United Kingdom and he further stated that prior to his be­coming a British National the respondent was "a Ban­gladeshi (Pakistani")<br/> <br/>45. On 29th January, 1979 the Consular Section of British High Commission in Dhaka wrote to re­spondent's mother regretting its inability to intervene on her behalf for the return of the property to her son.<br/> <br/>46. On 24th January, 1981 the respondent for the first time personally wrote to the Government for release of the property wherein he stated that he was a British subject and prior to becoming a British Na­tional he was a Bangladeshi Citizen.<br/> <br/>47. On 16th July, 1984 the Government asked the respondent's mother to produce some documents-respondent's British Nationality Certificate, his declar­ation that he relinquished Pakistani Nationality, and Bangladeshi Nationality Certificate, if acquired- by 1st September, 1984. Subsequently time was extended upto 30th September, 1984. In the meantime on 8th September, 1984 the respondent himself wrote to the Government:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“I was a permanent resident of the ter­ritories now comprised in Bangladesh and, according to the nationality law of Bangladesh, I still continue to be a permanent resident of those territories inspite of my stay in U. K. from 1952. It is again according to the nationality law of Bangladesh that being a per­manent resident of the territories of Bangladesh I am a citizen of Bangladesh and still continue to be a citizen of Bangladesh inspite of my obtaining a British passport on 14th April, 1972".</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>48. On 20th November, 1984 the respondent's mother made a representation to the President for the release of the property but her prayer was reject­ed on 4th February, 1985.<br/> <br/>49. The appellant's case is that the respondent was a citizen of Pakistan when Bangladesh became an independent country, and when the President's Order No.16 of 1972 came into force; that the re­spondent has not furnished any paper to show that he had acquired domicile certificate in the then East Pakistan and that he went to London in 1952 for higher education with an International Pakistani Passport; that the respondent was not a permanent resident of the territory of Bangladesh on 25th March, 1971; that he was permanently residing in London as a Pakistani citizen at the relevant time; that the property was legally declared and taken over in 1972 as an abandoned property; that respon­dent's mother prayed for release of the abandoned property on the ground that her son was a British Citizen and she never claimed her son to be a citi­zen of Bangladesh at any point of time; and that there was great delay in filing the writ petition and that the petition was not maintainable through a constituted Attorney.<br/> <br/>50. The High Court Division struck down the appellant's order dated 4th February, 1985 and di­rected the Government to restore the property to the respondent<br/> <br/>51. Let me first refer to the High Court Divi­sion's observations on the circumstances in which the property in question was treated as an abandoned property;<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"It appears to us that on 28.2.72, when the law of abandoned property came into operation, the petitioner was living in the United King­dom and the fact that he managed his disputed property at Dhaka through a local resident at Dhaka was neither a notorious fact nor a matter of common knowledge. He did not renounce his Pakistani citizenship to the knowledge of any Bangladeshi authority at home or abroad. He did not sign any declaration of allegiance to Ban­gladesh. He did not apply for any Bangladeshi citizenship or passport. In view of his continued and prolonged stay in the United Kingdom and in view of his total lack of concern for either Ban­gladeshi citizenship or Bangladesh passport, if it transpires to the authority concerned that the pe­titioner was admittedly a Pakistani on the 25th day of March, 1971 and has never been heard of to be either a Bangladeshi citizen or a Bangladesh passport holder, then it cannot be blamed for tak­ing over and treating the disputed property as an abandoned property."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>52. Immediately after making the above observa­tion the High Court Division noted that "the matter is otherwise after 1973." It was because of a change in the law of citizenship of Bangladesh by Act V of 1973. The High Court Division held that the peti­tioner surrendered his Pakistani passport; that there was nothing to connect him with the citizenship of Pakistan after the law of abandoned property came into operation; that the petitioner made a representation that by virtue of Act V of 1973 he was a citizen of Bangladesh and that if by the citizenship laws of Bangladesh the petitioner be deemed to be a resident in Bangladesh on and after the 25th day of March, 1971, then his Bangladesh citizenship was not lost at any time, even though he may not have applied for a Bangladeshi passport, for citizenship and acquisition passport are not synonymous; and that the petitioner was a British-Bangladeshi and the law of aban­doned property did not apply to him.<br/> <br/>53. The respondent's assertion that the house in question was not an abandoned property under Article 2(I)(i) of the Bangladesh Abandoned Property (Control, Management and Disposal) Order, 1972(P.O.16 of 1972) calls for a determination of his claim that he was a citizen of Bangladesh by opera­tion of law on 28th February, 1972 when P.O. 16 of 1972 came into operation and as such his property could not come within the mischief of the provision of Article 2(1)(i) of that Order. The question, as raised in the instant case, did not come up for consideration in <em><strong>M/s. Khan Bros Ltd. V. Government of Bangladesh 27 DLR 423, M/s. Helal Jute Press Ltd. V. Government of Bangladesh 27 DLR 551, Govern­ment of Bangladesh V. M/s. A.T.J. Industries Ltd. and others 28 DLR (AD) 120, or in Bangladesh V. M/s. Speed bird Navigation Co. and others 30 DLR (SC) 101.</strong></em><br/>54. I, however, like to refer to the following observations made in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the re­port in <em><strong>28 DLR (AD) 120</strong></em> on Article 2(1) of P.O. 16 of 1972:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"The best way to interpret it is to give a harmonious meaning to all the clauses of Arti­cle 2(1) so that each clause gets its own mean­ing and at the same time harmonises with the meaning of the whole. The defining part de­notes property owned by a person who is either not present in Bangladesh, or whose where about are not known, or who has ceased to oc­cupy supervise or manage in person his proper­ly. A question may arise whether the three sub-clauses are disjunctive or conjunctive. We think they have been used disjunctively and there is no need to construe them conjunctively.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Then comes the inclusive definition. In the inclusive definition is included two catego­ries of property, first is the property owned by a person who is a citizen of a State which after 25th day of March, 1971 either is at war or en­gaged in military operation against Bangladesh; the second is the property taken over by the Government under Acting President's Order No. I of 1971. So far as the inclusive clause is concerned both the categories of properties come within the meaning of the definition of abandoned property."<br/> <br/>55. In paragraph 10 of that report it was ob­served:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Preliminary formation of opinion of the Government is, however, not necessary for the properties coming within the ambit of the two categories included in the inclusion clause."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>56. The same view was reiterated in <em><strong>30 DLR (SC) 101</strong></em>. In this case the Government's stand is that the property in question is an abandoned proper­ty under Article 2(1)(i).<br/> <br/>57. The relevant provisions of law of both P.O. 16 of 1972 and P.O. 149 of 1972 have been quoted in the judgment of my learned brother, Chowdhury J. I need not quote all of them again. I will only re­fer to some portion.<br/> <br/>58. On 15th December, 1972 the Bangladesh Citizenship (Temporary Provisions) Order, 1972 (P.O. 149 of 1972) came into force. It was to take ef­fect on 26th day of March, 1971. Article 2 of that Order reads as follows:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"2. Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law on the commencement of this Order, every person shall be deemed to be a citizen of Bangladesh-<br/>(i) Who or whose father or grandfather was born in the territories now comprised in Bangladesh and who was a permanent resident of such territories on the 25th day of March, 1971, and continues to be so res­ident, or<br/>(ii) who was a permanent resident of the territories now comprised in Bangladesh on the 25th day of March, 1971, and continues be so resident and is not otherwise disqualified for being a citizen by or under any law for the time being in force; Provid­ed that if any person is a permanent resident of the territories now comprised in Bangla­desh or his dependent is, in the course of his employment or for the pursuit of his studies residing in a country which was at war with, or engaged in military operations against Bangladesh and is being prevented from returning to Bangladesh, such person, or his dependents, shall be deemed to con­tinue to be resident in Bangladesh."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>59. The respondent's father or grandfather was not born in this country. He has claimed to be a citi­zen of Bangladesh by virtue of clause (ii) of Article 2 of President Order No. 149 of 1972 read with Article 2A which was inserted by the Bangladesh Citi­zenship (Temporary Provisions) (Amendment) Act, 1973 (Act V of 1973) and given effect to from 26th March, 1971. Article 2A runs as follows: -<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"2A. A person to whom Article 2 would have ordinarily applied but for his residence in the United Kingdom shall be deemed to contin­ue to be permanent resident in Bangladesh with­in the meaning of that Article:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Provided that the government may notify in the official Gazette, any person or categories of person to whom this Article shall not apply".</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>60. Every person who claims to be a citizen of Bangladesh whether under clause (i) or clause (ii) of Article 2 must show that he was a permanent resi­dent of the territories comprised in Bangladesh on 25th day of March, 1971 and, further, he continues to be so resident in this country. He or his dependent will, however, be deemed to continue to be resident in this country if he or his dependent is, in the course of his employment or the pursuit of his stud­ies residing in a country, which was at war with, or engaged in military operations against Bangladesh and is being prevented from returning to Bangladesh. Further, by the deeming provision of Article 2A one would be deemed to continue to be a permanent resi­dent of Bangladesh even if he has been residing in the United Kingdom after 25th day of March, 19971. No other interpretation could be given without vio­lating the ordinary meanings of the words used in Articles 2 and 2A.<br/> <br/>61. In the facts of the case as the Government cannot be blamed for treating the respondent's prop­erty as an abandoned property in 1972, the High Court Division held so, the onus was on the respon­dent to prove that he was not a Pakistani citizen and that on the relevant date he was citizen of Bangla­desh. The High Court Division, however, wrongly placed the onus on the appellant to show that the re­spondent retained Pakistani citizenship or that he subsequently acquired Pakistani citizenship. Whether the respondent relinquished his Pakistani citizenship on or before 28th April, 1972 was within his exclusive knowledge and he alone could disclose that fact but he refused to do so either in reply to the appellant's queries or in his writ petition before the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>62. It is a matter of common knowledge that of liberation when the country was settling down, any one who wanted to draw any benefit from the Government of Bangladesh-either drawing salary or pension, or withdrawing any money, or seeking release of property in the custody of the Government, or asking for a travel document-was required to owe allegiance to the new republic. The respondent was not then residing in the country. Till 28.2.1972 when P.O. 16 of 1972 came into operation the respondent was residing in England holding a Pakistani Passport. The co-incidence that P.O.16 of 1972 came into operation on 28.2.1972 and on the same day he "discarded" or "surrendered", both the expressions are the respondent's, the Pakistani passport is of no significance because there is nothing to show that that he relinquished his Pakistani citizenship before acquisition of British citizenship on 16<sup>th</sup> April,1972. It appears the respondent avoided, for the reasons best known to him, making any personal representation to the Government for the release of property for a long time. Instead, he chose to seek help, through his mother, of the British High Commission at Dhaka for the release of his property on the ground that as he was a British subject his property could not be taken as an aban­doned property. This may be because before inser­tion of Article 2A in the citizenship law in 1973 the respondent could not claim citizenship of this country. Even assuming that he was a permanent resident in this country he did not continue to be so resident, as required under Article 2, when his prop­erty was treated as an abandoned property.<br/> <br/>63. In the background of the case where the re­spondent did not personally make any representation to the Government for more than eight years after the property in question was treated as an abandoned property on the ground that he was not a Pakistani citizen, it was in the fitness of things that the Government would ask the respondent before releasing the property whether he renounced his Pakistani citizenship which appeared to have continued till he acquired British citizenship on 6th April, 1972. The respondent, however, replied oh 8th September, 1984 in the following manner:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"As regards the demand for production of my declaration relinquishing Pakistan nationali­ty it presupposes that as if I was a citizen of present Pakistan on the 25th March, 1971 and therefore, there is no material or basis for such an assumption; rather the pertinent facts stated herein before negative such assumption and go to establish my Bangladesh citizenship on the 25th March, 1971 under the Bangladesh Citi­zenship.(Temporary Provisions) Order, 1972 as amended by Act V of 1973 and Ordinance No. VII of 1978. Hence, the question of my making a declaration renouncing Pakistan citizenship did not arise as the same did not arise on the 25th March, 1971 or at any time thereafter in the cases of 8 crores of permanent residents and citizens of Bangladesh, including Government servants. As regards production of Bangladesh nationality certificate; I did not apply for such certificate."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>64. It is not understood what prompted the re­spondent to take the above stance and what prevent­ed him for making a declaration that he relinquished his Pakistani citizenship. The quest for release of his property would have ended if respondent could show that he had already relinquished his Pakistan citizenship and on 28th February, 1972 he was not a Pakistani citizen. Instead, he chose to insist that he was a citizen of Bangladesh by operation of law. He is, of course, is entitled to claim citizenship of this country by operation of law if he can unmistakably bring himself within the ambit of Article 2 and Ar­ticle 2A of P.O. 149 of 1972.<br/> <br/>65. The respondent's claim that he is a citizen of Bangladesh by operation of law calls for determi­nation of a question of fact that he was a permanent resident of Bangladesh on 25th March, 1971. From 1952 to 1971 he claimed to have paid occasional visit to Dhaka for brief periods. But he did not dis­close any date or year of his visit. The only definite date of his visit is that he came to Dhaka on 13th September, 1972. He stayed here for less than three weeks. There is no evidence that he visited this country after 1972. The writ petition was filed by his constituted attorney. The respondent cannot gainsay the natural consequences of his continued residence in the U.K. from 1952. His long absence from this country and the inordinate delay in not making any personal representation to the Govern­ment for the release of the property in question in­dicate an absence of any intention on his part to re­turn to this country as a home. His positive inten­tion not to return to this country where he is now claiming to be a permanent resident by operation of law, is reflected by his conduct in 1972 when he, instead of asking for a Bangladesh passport or citi­zenship, applied at first for the British passport and then for British citizenship. His acts and conduct subsequent to the time at which his state of his mind as to his intention is to be determined may le­gitimately be considered.<br/> <br/>66. The ownership of a house or of a flat and payment of taxes and dues on such properties though relevant are not conclusive evidence for holding that the owner is a permanent resident in the country where the property is situate. The term 'permanent resident' connotes something more than the term "habitual resident" or "ordinarily resident", used in private international law. One can have per­manent residence only in one country. The concept of permanent residence is akin to that of domicile. The question of domicile usually comes up for con­sideration in case of private international law where the parties lead evidence and stand the scrutiny of cross examination for ascertaining the law that de­termines personal rights of a party with regard to his majority or minority, his marriage, right of succession etc.<br/> <br/>67. The respondent's assertions through a con­stituted attorney made in the summary proceeding under Article 102 of the Constitution are no substi­tute for the standard of proof usually required for as­certaining a fact like permanent residence on a par­ticular date for determination of the question of citizenship. As the petitioner filed the writ petition through his constituted attorney there is no statement on his own affirmation before the Court that he relin­quished his Pakistani citizenship and that he owes al­legiance to this country.<br/> <br/>68. When there is no satisfactory evidence as to the respondent's permanent residence in this country on 25th March, 1971 and there is no averment that he relinquished his Pakistani citizenship the appellant cannot be blamed for asking the respondent to state whether he renounced his Pakistani citizenship or whether he applied for Bangladeshi citizenship. The respondent's refusal to give satisfactory answer to the appellant's queries only deepened the latter doubt that on 25th March, 1971 and from then on, at least, till 6th April, 1972 he was a resident in the United King­dom as a Pakistani citizen. Article 3 of P.O. 149 of 1972 provides that in case of doubt as to whether a person is qualified to be deemed to be a citizen of Bangladesh under Article 2 of that Order, the question shall be decided by the Government, which decision shall be final.<br/> <br/>69. In the facts of the case the appellant's treat­ing the respondent's property as abandoned property under Article 2(1)(i) of P.O. 16 of 1972 and its subse­quent refusal to release the property cannot be termed as illegal or unjustified. Accordingly, I allow the ap­peal. The judgment and order of the High Court is set aside. No costs.<br/> <br/><strong><u>A. T. M. Afzal J:</u></strong><br/> <br/>I have gone through the judgments prepared by my learned brothers <strong>Badrul Haider Chowdhury and M.H. Rahman JJ:</strong> I concur with the judgment of <strong>Badrul Haider Chowdhury J.</strong><br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Order of the Court</u></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>By a majority decision, the appeal is dismissed. There will, however, be no order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>
