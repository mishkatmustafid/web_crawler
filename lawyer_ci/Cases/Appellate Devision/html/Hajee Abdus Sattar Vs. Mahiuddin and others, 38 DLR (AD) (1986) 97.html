The order impugned of the High Co­urt Division is dated 18 January 1984 in Civil Revision No, 184 of 1983 arising out of Title Appeal No. 87 of 1977 of the Additional Court of Subordinate Judge, Noakhali.<br/> <br/>2. The suit Hand is a Chandina-bhiti with a construction thereon in Maijdee town. One Gagan Ali was admittedly its owner in pos­session. In fact he had only the possessor right therein. Case of the plaintiff-appellant is that Gagan Ali sold the premises to him by a registered sale-deed dated 8 December 1953 (Ext.l) and delivered possession to him. Thereafter he possessed it by inducting different tenants, one Hasmatullah (P.W. 4) being one such tenant. After the tenancy of Hasmatullah was terminated the appellant inducted into the premises as tenant one Kala Miah by a registered Agreement dated 31 August 1964 corresponding to 15 Bhadra 1371 B.S. (Ext 3). Kala Miah continued his tenancy on payment of rent till his death and on his death his sons and other heirs, who are the main defendants in this suit, held over possession as tenants but they defaulted in payment of rent. The appel­lant therefore filed the suit namely O.C. Suit No 886 of 1973, in the First Court of Munsif, Noakhali, for realisation of arrears of rent from January 1972 to October 1973 at the rate of Rs. 45/- per month and also for eviction of the defendants tenants on whom notice of eviction was already served under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act.<br/> <br/>3. Defendant No.1, (respondent No. 1) son of Kala Miah, contested the suit denying the appellant's title altogether and setting up a rival claim of title himself on the basis of purchase from one Mohammadullah. He con­tended that the original owner, Gagan Ali, did not sell the premises to the appellant under any kabala, like Ext.1. but Gagan Ali made oral transfer of his interests inc­luding possession of the suit-land to Moh­ammadullah and that it is Mohammadullah who, by an unregistered Agreement dated 2-6-64 (Ext. Ka) sold the premises to him on receipt of consideration of Tk. 600/-and since then he has been possessing it as of his own right. He denied that his father Kala Miah was a tenant under the appellant or that he got the premises by inheritance from his fat­her and, as such, no question of his holding over as a tenant of the appellant arose<br/> <br/>4. The learned Munsif on consideration of the evidence both oral and documentary held that Kala Mia was not a tenant under the plaintiff, that defendant No.1 has been possessing the suit property on the basis of his purchase from Mohammadullah who, on his turn, had purchased it from Gagan Ali and that there was no landlord-tenant relat­ionship between the plaintiff and the defen­dants and on these findings he dismissed the suit by judgment dated 8-5-74, The plaintiff preferred an appeal but the appeal was dism­issed by the subordinate Judge against whose decision the plaintiff filed a revisional appli­cation being Revision Case No. 387 of 1981 before the High Court Division and the lat­ter, on allowing the application, remanded the appeal to the Subordinate Judge for rehearing. Thus after re-hearing the appeal the learned Subordinate Judge by his judgm­ent dated 24-4-83 allowed the appeal, reve­rsed the trial Court's judgment and decre­ed the suit finding, among other things, that the plaintiff got title from Gagan Ali by the Sale-deed Ext 1, that the plaintiff inducted Kala Mia, father of defendant No. 1, as tenant by the registered Agreement, Ext.3, that on the death of Kala Mia his heirs including def­endant No.1 held over possession as tenants but defaulted in the payment of rent This decision of the appellate Court was again challenged by defendant No.1, in revision, namely Civil Revision No. 184 of 1983 and the learned Single Judge, by the impugned judgment, reversed the appellate Court's de­cision and restored that of the trial Court.<br/> <br/>5. Mr. Asrarul Hossain, learned Advocate for the appellant, has seriously assailed the decision of the learned Single Judge, parti­cularly his interference in revision with the finding of facts arrived at by the lower Appel­late Court on the question whether the res­pondents were tenants by 'holding-over' under the appellant. The learned Advocate has criticised the learned Single Judge for, what he terms, illegally rejecting the appellant's documentary evidence including a clear admission of the respondent that he was a tenant under the appellant and also for the view taken by the learned Single Judge that in the absence of satisfactory proof of payment of rent the "respondent was not a tenant of the appellant whose registered ins­truments including the registered Lease Agreement have been arbitrarily rejected. The learned Advocate contends that in view of creation of the tenancy in favour of Kala Mia, father of the respondent, the latter was esto­pped from questioning the appellant's title under section 116 of the Evidence Act.<br/> <br/>6. The law on the subject, that is, land­lord-tenant relationship, is a settled law. It has been expounded in section 116 of the Evi­dence Act which is quoted below for proper appreciation in this case:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"116. No tenant of immovable pro­perty, or person claiming through such tenant, shall, during the continuance of the tenancy, be permitted to deny that the landlord of such tenant had, at the beginning of the tenancy, a title to such immovable property; and no person who came upon any immovable property by the license of She person in possession. Thereof shall be permitted to deny that such person had a title to such possession at the time when such license was given."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The estoppel as described in this section is known as tenant's estoppel or estoppel by contract. This estoppel is founded upon a contract between the tenant and the landlord. It provides that when a person enters into possession of immovable property as a tenant of another person then neither he nor anybody claiming through him shall be permitted dur­ing the continuance of the tenancy to deny the landlord's title however defective that title might be. This necessarily implies that in case the tenant sets up a claim of title in himself he shall first surrender possession to the person from whom he had taken it. This principle of law has been nicely expounded by <em><strong>Jessel M. R. in Re. Stringer's Estate, page 384 L.R. 6 Chi. 9</strong></em> in the following works:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Where a man having no title obtains possession of land under demise by a man in possession who assumes to give him a title as tenant, he cannot deny his landlord's title. This is a perfectly intelligible doctrine. He took possession under a contract to pay rent so long as he held possession under the landlord, and to give it up at the end of the term to the landlord, and having taken it in that way he is not allowed to say that the man whose title he admits and under whose title he took possession has not a title. That is a well established doctrine. That is estoppel by contract."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Sometimes it is found that after entering into possession as a tenant a person, from some motive, defaults in the payment of rent and when the question of eviction is raised he takes the plea that he is not a tenant for there is no evidence that he ever paid rent to the landlord, Such a device cannot carry him anywhere in view of the basic principle that once he is found to have entered into possession as a tenant non-payment of rent shall not be interpreted as non-existence of the tenancy. Payment of rent is one among many other proofs of a tenancy. Mere non-payment of rent does not terminate the tenancy or make the possession of the tenant adverse to the landlord, as has been rightly held in the case of <em><strong>J. M. Singh v. Baldeo Singh. 49 I. A. 299.</strong></em> This position is based on the footing that once relation of landlord and tenant is established it is presumed to continue, and the burden of proving that it has ceased is on the person who alleges it to have ceased. Section 116 in express language precludes the tenant from questioning his landlord's title during the continuance of the tenancy: this section however does not debar him from doing so after it is shown by him that the land­lord's title has been lost or extinguished since then. But if he himself claims title he must first surrender possession to the person from whom he had taken the lease. Again, if the landlord determines the tenancy on any ground but the tenant continues to stay on still the tenant will be estopped from questioning the landlord's title unless he restores possession to the landlord who had put him into poss­ession.<br/> <br/>7. Mr. T.H. Khan, learned Advocate for the respondent does not dispute this proposi­tion of law particularly when the question has finally been decided by the Privy Council in the case of <em><strong>Currimbhoy &amp; Co. vs. Greet, AIR 1933 (PC) 29</strong></em>. But his contention is that mine instant case the appellant failed to prove that the respondent was his tenant by holding over or that his father, Kala Mia, had been a tenant under the appellant; on the contrary, he contends, evidence has been led by the respondent to show that he had got possession of the land by purchase in his own name and by his own right and that his father was not a tenant of the appellant, that he did not inherit it on his father's death and as such, there was no question of holding over. This argument clearly takes us back to the disputed facts between the pasties, whether Kala Mia was a tenant under the appellant and, if so, whether Kala Mia's heirs including defendant, respondent No.1 continued in the tenancy. Since these questions had been decided finally by the appellate Court they could not be reopened and re-agitated in revision unless it is shown that the findings had not been made on due consideration of ail material evidence according to established principles of assess­ment of evidence. As such the evidence both oral and documentary requires to be reviewed.<br/> <br/>8. Registered Agreement Ext. 3 is the evi­dence of creation of a tenancy by the appel­lant in favour of Kala Mia at a monthly rent of Tk. 45/-,The learned Single Judge has ob­served that though this exhibit is a registered Agreement, it does not by itself prove the tenancy. What appears to be meant by this observation is that the Agreement even if genuine might not have been acted upon. The res­pondent questioned the execution of the Agree­ment and also alleged that it was not acted upon. So far as the execution is concerned, besides P.W. 1 (the appellant), P.W. 5 a Deed-writer, has deposed that he had written this Agreement which was executed in his presence. As to whether it was acted upon, besides the evidence of P.W.1, there is the evidence of a number of witnesses including P.W.s. 2, 3 and 4, P.W. 2 is Kala Mia's son-in-law, that is, he is brother-in-law of the respondent (defendant No-1); he has supported the appellant’s case that Kala Mia was a tenant under the appel­lant and resided in the house carrying on cloth-business there. Evidence of P.W. 2 was sought to be discarded on the ground that the married a step-sister of defendant No.l and as such he is hostile to him. But there is no evidence whatever that there was any clash of interest or enmity between defendant No.1. and P.W. 2; and if there were any strained relationship between them, it appears, it is due to the fact that P.W. 2, though a relation, came to the Court to depose against him dis­closing the truth and not supporting his claim of rival title by the unregistered Agreement (Ext. Ka) which has been challenged by the appellant to be antedated P.W. 3 is an in­dependent witness. He is a practising lawyer having residence near the suit premises. He claims to know both the parties. He has stated that the premises belonged to the appellant who possessed it through different tenants and that he saw Kala Mia possessing it as a tenant of the appellant, P.W. 4, Hashmatullah, says that he possessed the premises as a tenant of the app­ellant before the structure was destroyed by fire, that is, prior to Kala Mia's tenancy. On consideration of evidence the lower Appellate Court held that the Agreement, Ext. 3, was not only genuine but it was acted upon. Case of the respondent (Kala Mia's son,) is that his father did not take the tenancy, but he himself purchased the premises from one Mohammadullah, who is D.W. 2. Mohammadullah’s evidence is that he sold it to the res­pondent by the unregistered Agreement, Ext. ‘Ka’. as already stated on 2-6-64, that is, about three months earlier than Kala Mia's registered Agreement, Ext.3. If Ext. 'Ka' is relied upon, then we find two tenants simul­taneously for the same premises, one is the father and the other is the son. Case of the appellant is that Ext. ‘Ka’ is a fraudulent and antedated document. Even if it were not fraud­ulent and antedated, still the broad fact remains that under this Agreement no interest passed to Kala Mia's son unless it is shown that Mohammadullah had any right, title or inter­est in the premises himself. Mohammadullah claims title from Gagan Ali Bepari, but there is no paper to show that Gagan Ali Bepari had transferred the premises to Mohammadullah. Secondly, Gagan Ali Bepari could not have made such transfer in 1964 as he had already transferred his entire interest in the premises to the appellant by an earlier regi­stered Sale-deed dated 8-12-53, Ext. 1. The claim of the respondent that he purchased it from Mohammadullah is negatived by Ext.1 read with the supporting oral evidence. Evidence of Mohammadullah has been challenged on another ground; his elder brother P.W 4 Hashmatullah has deposed that he had taken lease of the premises from the appel­lant as a month to month tenant by a registered Agreement dated 13-6-55 (Ext. 3 A) and contin­ued there till the structure was gutted by fire in 1964. He has further deposed that Moham­madullah, his younger brother, was at that time a mere student. Thus it appears that Mohammadullah, respondent's vendor, was not even a tenant in the premises but his elder brother was the tenant. To avoid the question of validity of the alleged transfer of the property by Mohammadullah to him, the respondent went to the extent of denying the genuineness of the appellant's title under, Ext.1, the registered sale-deed and it has been argued that this Sale-deed was either fraudu­lent or it was not acted upon, To coun­ter this contention evidence, both oral and documentary, has been led by the appellant. It is that after the purchase under Ext.1, and when Hashmatullah was a tenant, the pre­mises was sold in auction for recovery of some public dues and it is the appellant who got the sale set aside. In this connection the appellant filed an order of the Board of Revenue setting aside the sale at his instance. That order is Ext. 5 dated 30 January. 1960. P. W. 3, the lawyer, has supported the appe­llant's ease saying that he was engaged by the appellant in the proceedings for setting aside the auction sale under Ext. 5. The learned Single Judge has observed that this document got no direct bearing on the issue in question. If the tenancy of Kate Mia is in question, this document is not so much relevant, but if the appellant-land­lord's title is challenged, this document is very much relevant. We therefore find that the respondent with a view to boosting up his story of purchase from Mohammadullah, who was nobody to make any such transfer, raised out of motive the dispute about the appellant's original title under Ext. 1, the registered sale-deed, executed by Gagan Ali Bepari. Curiously enough, it is Gagan Ali Bepari from whom Mohammadullah claims title by oral purchase at a subsequent date. In the circumstances, the appellate Court's find­ing that both Exts. 1. and 3 are genuine doc­uments and were acted upon is a finding based on proper consideration of evidence and as such this finding was not open for re-opening in the re visional jurisdiction of the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>9. Mr. Asrarul Hossain has laid consider­able stress on Exts. 4 and 4(a) which purpo­rtedly contain an admission of the respon­dent (defendant No.1) that he was a tenant under the appellant. These exhibits are cer­tified copies of two applications of the respondent to the Additional Deputy Comm­issioner (Revenue) praying for settlement to the suit-premises from the Government, the ultimate owner. Both the appellant and the respondent (defendant No. 1) prayed for sett­lement from the Government in 1973 whereupon two separate cases were started which ended, ultimately in favour of the appellant, obviously in view of the ap­pellant's possessory right from Gagan Alt Bepari for a long time. The question raised here, however, is not as to who got the settlement from the Government, In both these applications, Ext.4 and 4(a), filed about six years after his father Kala Mia's death, the respondent (defendant No.l) stated that he was a tenant of the appellant, Haji Abdus Sattar, who by misrepresentation had created the tenancy though he had no title, that bec­ause of this defect of title, he was offering himself as a candidate for settlement in view of the fact that he had been running a cloth-shop in the premises for a long time. This is a clear admission and it stops him from denying the appellant's title in the premises. To wriggle out of this tight corner, he has contended that the documents exhibits 4 &amp; 4 (a), are not correct copies of his applications to the Revenue Authorities. The learned Single Judge has observed that these copies of the applications were not legally proved, that they are private documents and further that attention of the respondent was not drawn to the statement contained in these applica­tions, and as such the question of binding him with the statement therein does not arise. This observation, we find, got no legal or factual basis. For, these are certified copies of applications to the Additional Deputy Commissioner for settlement, who after nec­essary endorsement, incorporated them into the record of the Settlement Case and iss­ued certified copies thereof in accordance wish law ; the originals of the applications cannot be produced or obtained by any­body unless a Court calls for them. These certified copies were filed as exhibits in this suit in presence of the respondent who then raised objection, but the Court ignoring his objection marked them as exhibits 4 and 4(a). Again, while deposing in Court as P.W.1 he himself drew his attention to these documents stating in his- examination-in-chief that these were not true copies of his applications to the Additional De­puty Commissioner. In the circumstances, there was no necessity for drawing his further attention to them during cross-examination. As to the authenticity of these certified copies, the respondent did not apply to the Court to lodge a comp­laint under section 195 Cr.P.C. against the appellant on a charge of forgery who produced or filed in evidence these docum­ents in a judicial proceeding. Such a com­plaint may be filed under section 195(1) (c) Cr.P.C. even now if the respondent dares to move the Court for that purpose. These documents issued and certified to be true copies by an authorised officer of the Government are admissible in evidence. The statement contained therein as described above is an admission within the meaning of section 20 of the Evidence Act and the respon­dent is bound by his admission that be was a tenant of the appellant who allegedly got no valid title to the premises.<br/> <br/>10. Mr.T.H. Khan, learned Advocate for the respondent, has tried to make out a case of total non-payment of rent and has conten­ded that in the absence of reliable evidence that rent was ever paid to the appellant it cannot be said that any tenancy was created or the Agreement, Ext. 3 purportedly creating the tenancy was acted upon. Evidence in this connection is that Kala Mia paid rent so long he was alive and after his death his heirs, the defendants, became irregular in pay­ment of rent and ultimately stopped it. P.W. 2 has stated that Kala Mia during his life-time had engaged him to look after his cloth-shop and to pay rent for the premises and that the respondent paid rent for 14 months at a time by Ext. 6. He has also deposed that he had been authorised in writing by his father in-law to act as his Assistant in the cloth-business (Ext. 13). These two documents have been seriously challenged as fabrication for the pur­pose of the suit P.W. 2 has, of course, denied the suggestion as to fabrication of Exts. 6 and 13; but the payment of rent for 14 months at a time and non-production of any receipts for payment of rent for the earlier period create suspicion in the genuineness of the receipt Ext. 6. But I have already observed at the begin­ning that mere non-payment of rent does not snap landlord and tenant relationship and that non-payment of rent will not enable a tenant to question landlord's title unless he disconti­nues the tenancy and restores possession to the landlord. If mere non-payment of rent is taken as proof of non- existence of landlord and tenant relationship grave consequences will follow, for an unscrupulous tenant upon entering premises as a tenant will delibera­tely default with a view to challenge landlord's title at a convenient time. Mr.T.H. Khan has contended that there is no evidence of the respondents holding over and that if the evide­nce as to payment of, rent by Ext. 6 is rejected no tenancy under the appellant exists. Answer to this contention is contained in the principle enunciated already in paragraph 6 above. It is that once a tenancy is created, it will be pre­sumed that it is continuing, unless it is shown that it has ceased. The tenancy was created in favour of Kali Mia on whose death Ms Heirs (including defendant No.1) continued to pos­sess the premises. This is "holding over", for without Kala Mia’s tenancy they could not have entered upon possession particularly when the claim of independent title by purchase has fallen through. They say that they did not pay any rent to the appellant but such non-payment of rent hardly improves their case, for the tenancy continues even if payment of rent is not made.<br/> <br/>11. Lastly, Mr.T.H. Khan has drawn our attention to our decision in the case of <em><strong>Abdus Satter vs. Suresh Chandra Das, 32 DLR (AD) 170</strong></em> and has contended that a monthly tenancy is not heritable. In that case it was observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"A tenancy-at-will is determinate at the will of either land-lord or tenant, and is a personal relation between the original land-lord or tenant and is deter­mined by the death of either of them".</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It is obvious that such a tenancy is not heri­table in the sense that on the death of a tenant his heirs are not under any legal obligation to pay rent to the landlord or to continue the tenancy, in the same way, as the landlord is not bound to keep the lease alive. Both the parties are at liberty to discontinue the tenan­cy. If the heirs of the late tenant continue to stay on, but do not pay rent they shall not be permitted to say that the landlord has no title and in case they themselves claim title they must first of all restore possession to the landlord an act which has not been done in this case. As such they have been rightly held to be tenants by holding over.<br/> <br/>12. In the result, the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment of the High Court Division is set aside and that of the appellate Court is restored. As to costs, though the conduct of the respondent (defendant No.1) is reprehensible, calling for costs of the appeal, but since he got two judgments in his favour, we refrain from awarding any cost against him.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
