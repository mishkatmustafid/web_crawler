The appellant's case, in short, is that holding No. C/56, 3rd Colony, Mirpur, Dhaka was allotted to one Md. Hussain by ADC (Relief), Dhaka on 29.1.65 by an agreement of lease. The lessee Md. Hussain on 21.8.70 transferred the house to Md. Khalil Miah for a consideration of Taka 6,000.00 and mutated his name with the Relief Department of the Government. Thereafter on 22.3.1979 Md. Khalil Miah transferred the property to Shahida Begum for consideration of Tk. 8,000.00 who in turn again sold the house to Md. Rahmatullah on 15.12.1979. Subsequent thereto said Rahmatullah again transferred the property to the appellant on 16.1.80 who mutated his name in the CO (Revenue) and paid rent to the Government and possessing the property till today. The said house having been enlisted as an abandoned property in ‘Kha' list in the list of abandoned properties on A9.1986, the appellant filed the case before the Court of Settlement for deleting the same from the aforesaid 'Kha' fist.<br/> <br/>3. Before the. Court of Settlement, the Government did not file any written statement but contested the case by asserting that Md. Khalil Miah did not acquire any right, title and interest in the property by purchase from the original lessee, Md. Hussain on 28.8.1970 and that Md. Hussain was absent and left the house uncared for after the war of liberation and his whereabouts were not known and as such the property in question has been rightly enlisted as an abandoned properly under PO 16 of 1972.<br/>It appears that the Court of Settlement on a mere comparison of the signature of the lessee Md. Hussain on the indenture of the agreement and on the kabala executed by him in favour of Md. Khalil on 21.8.1970 held that the kabala does not appear to be a valid and genuine document and consequently found that the property is an abandoned property within the mischief of Article 2 of PO 16 of 1972.<br/> <br/>4. This material finding of the court of Settlement was challenged before the High Court Division mainly contending that the Court of Settlement misread and misconstrued these documents namely, the kabala and the indenture of lease of agreement and wrongly held that the property was an abandoned property on the basis of mere comparison of the signature appearing in the lease deed with the kabala. It appears that the learned Judges while summarily rejecting the writ petition did not at all apply their judicial minds to this material aspect of the case.<br/> <br/>5. Leave was granted for consideration whether on the face of the existence of the registered sale deed dated 21.8.70 by the original lessee in favour of Md. Khalil executed much before the war of liberation and before coming into operation of PO 16 of 1972 and the same sale deed in question having got presumption of validity, the property could be taken over as an abandoned property under Article 2 of PO 16 of 1972.<br/> <br/>6. From the record it appears that the case was filed by the appellant before the Court of Settlement on 10.1.88 and the hearing of the case was fixed on 27.1.88. Notice was issued on the respondent­-Government to appear in this case along with all papers, documents and witnesses if there be any on that date. it further appears that no written statement was filed by the Government challenging the validity and genuineness of the sale deed dated 21.8.70 executed by the original lessee. The case was heard and Judgment was delivered on 27.1.88. From the Judgment of the Court of Settlement it appears that no witnesses were examined by the parties and the Court of Settlement on a mere comparison of the signature of the original lessee Md. Hussain appearing in the kabala dated 21.8.1970 with the indenture of agreement dated 30.8.1966 found that the signature of the kabala does not tally with the signature appearing in the agreement and consequently found the kabala to be invalid and not genuine. It is to be stated that the document was registered after compliance with all the formalities of a transfer and there is no question of invalidity of the registration of the kabala in question. It was only argued by the Government that the kabala was not genuine and the court on mere comparison by its naked eyes held that the kabala is not genuine without there being any examination by the hand‑writing expert or thumb impression expert to ascertain the genuineness of the thumb impression and the signature of the original lessee Md. Hussain when admittedly both these documents contain the signature and thumb impressions of the lessee. It thus appears that without affording proper and adequate opportunity to the appellant the kabala dated 21.8.70 was held to be invalid by the Court of Settlement. It may be pointed out that a registered document carries with it a presumption of validity and that presumption is a rebuttable presumption and after giving due opportunities to the parties concerned the same can be rebutted. In the present case the Court of Settlement in a very summary manner without affording adequate opportunity to the appellant to prove the genuineness of the kabala dated 20.8.1970 held the same to be invalid. The procedure adopted by the Court of Settlement being not in confirmity with law and the learned Judges of the High Court Division having not at all given their attention to this material question before disposal of the writ petition, the Judgments of the courts below are set aside. The appeal is allowed without any order as to cost and the same is remanded to the Court of Settlement for disposal of the case after giving adequate opportunities to the parties to prove the genuineness or otherwise of the kabala in question.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
