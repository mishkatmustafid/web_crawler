Subhan, J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This appeal by the defendants is on Special leave and is against the judgment of a Single Judge of the High Court Division, passed in a Second Appeal. The learned Judge set aside the judgment of the first Court of appeal and affirmed the judgment passed by the learned Munsif.<br/> <br/>2. The facts in brief are that the plain­tiffs brought a suit for recovery of money by way of damages against the defendants on the allegation that they had cut away the paddy grown by the plaintiffs on their land, as described in the plaint. The trial Court found that the plaintiffs had title and were in possession of the land in ques­tion and had grown the paddy. On these findings the suit was decreed by the trial Court. The first appellate Court, to whom an appeal was taken by the defendants, also found the plaintiffs title to the suit land but held that the defendants were in possession of the land they grew the paddy. The suit was accordingly dismissed by the first appellate Court.<br/> <br/>3. On appeal to the High Court Divi­sion, the learned Single Judge decreed the suit on the finding that the plaintiffs' title having been proved, the suit for compensation for wrongful reaping of paddy by the defendants was maintainable. In support of the finding the learned Single Judge relied upon the de­cision of Muralidhar vs. Rupendra Nath.<br/> <br/>4. Leave was granted by a person out of possession for compensation for wrongful possession, is maintainable without a prayer for declaration of title and with or without a further prayer for recovery of possession.<br/> <br/>5. Mr. Abdus Salam, the learned Counsel for appellants submitted that the suit was a money suit for damages caused by cutting away paddy grown by the plaintiffs. This suit according to Mr. Salam was for damages for the wrongful cutting of paddy and on the finding by lower appellate Court that defendant ap­pellants were in possession and they grew the paddy, the suit must fail. Mr. Salam further submitted that the decision upon which reliance was placed by the learned Single Judge has no application to the facts of this case.<br/> <br/>6. Plaintiffs' suit was for damages for wrongful cutting of paddy and it was not a suit for declaration of title or/and for recovery of possession. The finding of the learned Sin­gle Judge is not conclusive. The paddy was reaped away which, according to the first ap­pellate Court, which is the final Court of facts, was grown by the appellants who were also found by it to be in possession of the suit land. The plaintiff having not filed a suit, for declaration of title could have asked for compensation for the reaping away of the pad­dy had they been able to prove their possession and growing of the paddy. Otherwise, the plaintiffs in such a suit has to pray for decl­aration of his title to the land and its recovery from wrongful dispossession therefrom and must show that the suit was filed within the prescribed period of time. The plaintiffs in the instant case filed a money suit where his title was incidentally found by the Courts below. A suit for damages for the use and occupation of land and mesne profit is maint­ainable, where the plaintiffs' title to the land and wrongful occupation of it by the defend­ants are proved. As such the facts of the de­cision in Muralidhar's 56 C.W.N. 260 case are distinguishable. In that case the plaintiff filed the suit for damages on account of use and occupation or in the alternative for mesne profit, on the allegation that the defendants were in wrongful occupation as trespasser and plaintiffs' title was sufficiently proved, though he was found to be out of possession.<br/> <br/>7. In the instant case the finding of the first Appellate Court is that the defendants were in possession of the land and they had grown the paddy which was reaped away by them. The suit is not one for wrongful use and occupation of the land but is one for damages caused by reaping of the paddy grown by those who were sin possession of the disputed land. The find­ing of the first Court of appeal being that the appellants were in possession of the land and they grew the paddy, which was not reversed by the High Court, the suit cannot succeed. It is a case of failure of the plain­tiffs to prove their case.<br/> <br/>8. Mr. M. A. Aziz, the learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff-respondents failed to support the judgment of the learned Single Judge in the face of the patent inconclusiveness in the findings and the erroneous appli­cation of the cited decision by the learned Single Judge.<br/> <br/>9. In the result, therefore, the appeal is allowed with costs, the decision of the High Court is set aside and that of the Court of appeal below restored.<br/> <br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
