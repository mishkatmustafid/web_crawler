Abdul Matin J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 01.08.2005 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.1283 of 2000 discharging the Rule affirming the appellate court's judg­ment and decree dated 29.11.1999 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, First Court, Khulna in Title Appeal No.166 of 1989 dismissing the appeal affirming the judgment and decree dated 06.06.1989 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, Second Court, Khulna in Title Suit No.67 of 1982 dismissing the suit.<br/> <br/>2. The facts, in short, are that the plaintiff petitioner filed Title suit No. 67 of 1982 in the Court of the learned Subordinate Judge, 2nd Court, Khulna praying for a decree declaring that father of the defen­dant Nos.1 and 2 was the benamder of the plaintiff petitioner in respect of the suit land with further declaration of his right, title and interest in the suit land alleging as follows.<br/> <br/>3. The suit land originally belonged to on Patit Paban Shaha of Binodpur in the dis­trict of Jessore. The plaintiff petitioner took oral settlement of the suit land from Patit Paban Shaha in the first week of Baishak 1342 B.S. and got delivery of possession of the same on payment of Tk. 1200/- as salami fixing Tk.800/- as annual rent. Since the plaintiff petitioner used to live with his father and other brothers in joint mess he acquired the suit land in the banami of his brother-in-law. Mon Monohar Golder, father of the defen­dant Nos.1 and 2 in the suit in order to avoid any future claim of other members of the joint family. The suit land was acquired by the plaintiff petitioner out of his own separate fund and since then the plaintiff petitioner of along possessed the same on payment of rent to the landlord but he got the suit land recorded in the name of his banamder. Monmotha Nath Golder in S.A. khatian. After the death of the benamder. Monmotha Nath Golder, the defendant Nos.1 and 2 denied the benami character of the suit land in collusion with the father and other brothers of the plaintiff petitioner and thus denied the title of the plaintiff petitioner in the suit land in the last week of Poush 1388 B.S. which compelled the petitioner to file the present suit.<br/> <br/>4. The defendant Nos.1 and 2 contested the suit by filing written statement denying the material allegations made in the plaint contending, inter alia, that the suit land belonged to their father. Monmotha Nath Golder and the plaintiff petitioner newer acquired the same nor did he ever possess the same by giving barga to others. It is also contended in the written statement that the plaintiff petitioner after the death of the father of the defendant Nos.1 and 2 in 1980 took all the papers of the suit land taking advantage of the helplessness of the defendant Nos.1 and 2 on false representa­tion that he would take necessary steps for mutation of their names in the Government record in respect of the suit land and then filed the present suit. The plaintiff petitioner never acquired the suit land out of his own funds and the defen­dants were all along possessing the suit land from before and after the death of their father Monmotha Nath Golder.<br/> <br/>5. The trial court dismissed the suit by the judgment and decree dated 06.06.1988. The plaintiff petitioner thereupon being aggrieved filed Title Appeal No. 166 of 1989. The learned Additional District Judge, Court No. 1, Khulna heard and dis­posed of the said appeal by the judgment and decree dated 07.01.1990 sending the case back to the trial court for disposal of the suit upon rehearing by framing an issue as to whether the plaintiff petitioner acquired title to the suit land on the basis of adverse possession.<br/> <br/>6. The defendant Nos.1 and 2 being dissat­isfied with the aforesaid judgment and decree dated 07.01.1990 filed Civil Revision No. 3486 of 1990 mainly con­tending that the appellate Court below committed an error of law apparently on the face of the record in sending the suit back on remand to the trial court for rehearing by framing a fresh issue on acquisition of title by the plaintiff petition­er on adverse possession of the suit land inasmuch as the appellate court was itself competent to re-determine the suit by framing necessary issue when there was no order for taking additional evidence in the matter. It is stated that while the Rule in the said Civil Revision was pending the defendant Nos.1 and 2 divested right, tile and interest in the suit land in favour of the defendant opposite party No.1 and thus the defendant opposite party No.1 first transposed himself as co-petitioner No.3. Thereafter the High Court Division heard and disposed of the said Civil Revision by the judgment and order dated 16.11.1994 sending the case back on remand to the appellate court below for deciding the appeal on merit by making the Rule absolute. Subsequently the learned Additional District Judge, Court No.1, Khulna by the judgment and decree dated 20.11.1999 dismissed the appeal affirming the judgment and decree passed by the trial court, dismissing the suit. Against this back drop the plaintiff petitioner filed the Civil Revision before the High Court Division and after hearing the High Court Division discharged the Rule.<br/> <br/>7. We have heard the learned Advocate and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/> <br/>8. It appears that both the appellate court as well as the High Court Division found that the trial court rightly dismissed the suit and disbelieved the plaintiff’s case of banami.<br/> <br/>9. It further appears that the plaintiff did not take any step during the life time of Monmotha Nath. No suit was filed during his life time. Moreover the suit land was recorded in the name of Monmotha Nath. The finding of the trial court having been affirmed by the appellate court as well as the High Court Division the question of banami has been the conclusively decided by the courts below against the plaintiff. The courts below believed that the papers and documents were obtained by the peti­tioner from the mother of the defendants on false representation that those were necessary for the purpose of mutation of their names in the Government record. The plaintiff could not prove his possess­ing either.<br/> <br/>10. In such view of the matter the High Court Division committed no error of law in discharging the Rule and affirming the judgment and decree of the courts below.<br/> <br/>We find no merit in this petition which is accordingly dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
