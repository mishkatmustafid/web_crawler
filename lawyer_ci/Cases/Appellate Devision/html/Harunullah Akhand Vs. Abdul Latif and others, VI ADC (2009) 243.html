Ruhul Amin J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 26.06.2005 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 3214 of 1997 making the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>2. Short facts are that the plaintiff institut­ed Title Suit No.76 of 1992 in the Court of Additional Assistant Judge, 1st Court, Gazipur for declaration of title, stating, inter alia, that an area of 2 acres of land out of total 3.80 acres of C.S. Plot No. 1696 of Mouza Selan was taken settle­ment by plaintiffs' predecessor-in-interest, namely, Ishaque and Ismail on 08.08.1935 by patta from the original owner, Bhawal Court of Wards. Ishaque and Ismail paid rent to the Bhawal Court of Wards till the rent receiving interest was acquired by the Government and after their death, the plaintiff Nos.1-7 as heirs of Ishaque inher­ited the property and plaintiff Nos.20-25 as the heirs of Ismail are in continuous possession of the suit land on payment of rent regularly. The suit land was wrongly recorded in the name of Ishaque alone in S.A. Khatian No. 124 leaving out the heirs of Mohammad Ismail and there was fur­ther mistake in respect of the number of S.A. Plot No. 244 in place of 1696. Taking advantage of the wrong entry in the S. A. Khatian, the defendant No.1 entered into the suit land by tampering the records and the defendant No.1 made false claim in respect of northern 2 acres of Plot No. 1696 showing its area as 2.08 acres of land. The plaintiff earlier filed an applica­tion under section 143(A) of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act for correc­tion of S.A. record in which the defendant No.1 appeared and filed written objection. The Miscellaneous Case was disposed of on the ground of maintainability and in the meantime the stage for R.S. Operation was over. Hence the present suit.<br/> <br/>3. The defendant No.1 contested the suit by filing written statement denying the material allegations made in the plaint. The case of the defendant is that the suit is barred by limitation and his predecessor in interest took settlement of the entire suit land. Accordingly the S.A. Khatian was correctly prepared. So the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/>4. The trial court decreed the suit. On appeal the appellate court allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment and decree of the trial court and sent the case on remand for fresh hearing. Being aggrieved the plaintiff moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained the Rule and the High Court Division upon hearing made the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>5. We have heard Md. Nawab Ali, the learned Advocate-on-Record for the peti­tioner and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/> <br/>6. The High Court Division while making the Rule absolute observed the appellate court sent the suit back on remand for fresh hearing although the suit was 29 years old and the ground on which the suit was sent on remand was not tenable in the eye of law. The High Court Division fur­ther held that the appellate court did not at all apply its judicial mind in sending the suit back on remand to the trial court with the direction to include in the plaint the other portion of the suit plot that is the southern portion of C.S. Plot No. 1696 which was not the subject matter of the suit and it was nobody's case that southern portion of the suit plot was also disputed. Accordingly, the High Court Division held that the appellate court committed funda­mental mistake in sending back the suit on remand on such a flimsy ground.<br/> <br/>7. It may be noted here that the suit was for simple declaration of title and it was not a suit for partition. So it is not under­stood why the learned Judge of the appel­late court directed the trial court to include in the plaint the southern portion of the suit plot No.1696 which the plaintiff nei­ther prayed for inclusion in the plaint nor it was the case of the either party.<br/> <br/>8. Considering the facts and circum­stances of the matter and the materials on record, we are of the view that the High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision. There is no cogent reason to interfere with the same.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the leave petition is dis­missed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
