The suit was filed seeking a decree for permanent injunction.<br/> <br/>2. It was the case of the plaintiff that the land measuring 31.51 acres originally belonged to Bhagirath Mondal and others and the record of right was prepared in their names, that Bhagirath Mondal transferred his share to Abdul Wadud and others and they transferred the land so purchased on July 20,1970 to Abdus Salam on December 10,1970 and possession was delivered to Abdus Salam and he mutated his name, that Abdus Salam by the kabala dated February 19, 1986 transferred the land acquired from Abdul Wadud and others to the plaintiff and she mutated her name, that the defendants on 15th Sraban,1395 B.S. threatened the plaintiff to dispossess her from the land in suit. Hence the suit.<br/> <br/>3. The suit was contested by the defendant No.3 and defendant Nos.4-6 by filing separate sets of written statement denying the material averments made in the plaint and stating, inter alia, that the land in suit belonged to Sonatan Mondal, Tusta Roy Mondal, Kripa Nath Roy Mondal, Suraj Mohani Bewa and Satya Mohani Moyee Bewa and the C.S. record was prepared in their names each having share to the extent of 3 annas 4 gondas, that by successive devolutions  Satya Mohani Moyee Bewa's interest devolved upon Rajmoni and she transferred her share to Golap Dasi and Ananta Kumar who purchased the same in the benami of Dulal Gain who executed and registered a Muktipatra on July 29, 1944 in favour of Golap Dasi and Ananta Kumar in respect of 4.36½  acres of land, that Golap Dasi executed a Power of Attorney in favour of defendant No.3 in 1987 and the said defendant was possessing the land on behalf of Golap Dasi, that defendant No.3 transferred 2.33 acres of land on February 17,1988 to the defendant Nos.4-6 and the said defendants are in possession of the land they got by purchase.<br/> <br/>4. The trial Court on consideration of the materials, on record arrived at the finding that the plaintiff has better title in the land in suit and she is in possession of the land in suit and thereupon decreed the suit.<br/> <br/>5. The contesting defendants went on appeal. The appellate Court reversed the finding of the trial Court as to possession of the land by the plaintiff and thereupon allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment and decree of the trial Court. The High Court Division on consideration of the materials on record arrived at the finding "It appears that the appellate Court did not consider the evidence of all the P.Ws. and D.Ws." and that the appellate Court misread the evidence of P.W.2 relating to the matter of possession of the land in suit by plaintiff and his predecessor in interest. The High Court Division on consideration of the evidence on record arrived at the finding that the plaintiff proved her pos­session in the land in suit and the defen­dants did not produce any paper relating to payment of rent. On the aforesaid findings the High Court Division made the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>6. We have heard the learned Advocate-on-record. The learned Advocate-on-record could not point out that the consid­eration of evidence made by the High Court Division was not correct or that the said Division has misread the evidence or left the material evidence out of consider­ation. In a suit for permanent injunction question of title is gone into incidentally. The primary matter in a suit for permanent injunction, required to be proved by the party seeking decree of permanent injunc­tion is the possession of the land in suit. In the instant case the plaintiff has proved his prima facie title as well as possession in the land in suit.<br/> <br/>7. The learned Advocate-on-record failed to show that findings arrived at by the High Court Division is contrary to the materials on record. We do not find any ground to interfere with the judgment of the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>Accordingly the petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
