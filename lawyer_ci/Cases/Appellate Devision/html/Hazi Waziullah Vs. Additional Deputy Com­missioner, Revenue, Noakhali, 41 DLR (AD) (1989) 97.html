Plaintiffs-appellants filed the said suit for declaration of their title to the suit land as they found their title clouded by a Notice dated 18 April 1978 served upon them by the Sub-Divisional Officer, Feni, treating the suit land as Vested and Non-Resident Property and asking them to surrender it. Their simple case was that the suit land was not an enemy or vested property and as such the Notice for surrendering it was illegal and void.<br/> <br/>3. The suit land originally belonged to one Shashi Bhusan Mujumder, on whose death in or about the year 1943, his six sons including Hemendra Kumar Majumder inherited it along with other properties of Shashi Bhusan. After the death of Sha­shi Bhusan the six brothers amicably partitioned all the inherited properties lying in different places; the suit land at Feni fell exclusively to the share of Hemendra; the property at Narayanganj fell to the share of Dhirendra, the eldest of the brothers, while the property in Calcutta fell to the share of remaining four brothers, namely, Mohendra, Narendra, Satyendra and Rabindra. Hemendra by four registered sale-deeds transferred the suit land to the plaintiffs who went into possession thereof; but the Sub-Divisional Officer illegally served the notice treating it as enemy and vested property. Hence they filed the suit against the Sub-Divisional Officer (defendant No. 4.), Additional Deputy Commissioner and Assistant Custodian of Vested Property (defendant No. 3), Deputy Custodian of Vested Property (defendant No. 2) and the Government of Bangladesh (defendant No. 1) seeking declaration of their title to the Suitland.<br/> <br/>4. The suit was contested by two sets of defen­dants, one by the Government officials including the Additional Deputy Commissioner and one by the added defendants Nos. 5-11 who claimed to have tak­en lease of the suit land from the Vested Property Authorities. The common defence is that all the six sons of Shashi Bhusan, the original owner of the land, had migrated to India immediately after the Par­tition of the country in 1947 and they were Indian nationals when the Indo-Pak war of 1965 broke out in consequence of which the suit land became enemy property by operation of law and as such it was rightly Created as enemy and vested property and the Sub-Divisional Officer's notice for taking over possession of the land was perfectly lawful. The plain­tiffs' claim of amicable partition among the six sons of Shashi Bhusan was denied and it was challenged as a device to save the land from the mischief of law. It was also denied that Shashi Bhusan had left any property anywhere except the suit land at Feni. The plaintiffs' sale-deeds purportedly executed by Hemendra were also challenged as fraudulent transactions without any consideration in that Hemendra was not in Bangladesh at the purported time of execution and registration of the sale-deeds.<br/> <br/>5. The learned Subordinate Judge, on consider­ation of evidence, both oral and documentary includ­ing a Photostat copy of a declaration dated 2 April 1963 made by the four sons of Shashi Bhushan liv­ing in Calcutta (Ext. 16) and the judgment of a previ­ous suit in respect of the amicable partition of the same land (Ext. 7d), found that there was an amica­ble partition by which the suit land fell exclusively to the share of Hemendra who was all along in this country and that the transfers made by him to the plaintiffs were genuine; on those findings the learned Subordinate Judge decreed the suit in full. Both the sets of defendants challenged this judgment before the High Court Division—the Government and its officials by First Appeal No, 90 of 1979—and De­fendant Nos. 5-11 by First Appeal No. 46 of 1980. The learned Judges on re-assessment of the evidence held that the main documents in support of the ami­cable partition, namely the declaration (Ext. 16) and the judgment of the previous suit (Ext. 7d) are not admissible in evidence or at least they got no proba­tive value; and as to the nationality of the sons of the late Shashi Bhushan, the learned Judges found that except Hemendra all other sons of Shashi Bhu­san were Indian Nationals from before 1965 Indo-Pak War and as such the suit land to the extent of their share, that is, 5/6, was enemy and vested property and on those findings modified the trial court's judgment and decreed the suit to the extent of 1/6 only. Plaintiffs felt aggrieved thereby and filed these ap­peals by special leave which was granted by us to consider whether the learned Judges were justified in discarding Ext. 16, the Photostat copy of a purported declaration and the judgment, Ext. 7 (d) of a previous suit.<br/> <br/>6. Mr. S.R. Pal, learned Counsel for the ap­pellants has submitted that both the Photostat copy, Ext. 16 and the previous judgment Ext. 7(d) are not only admissible but also they have got evidentiary value, and that these documents, considered along with the oral evidence of P.Ws. 1 and 2, are suffi­cient to establish the claim of amicable partition among the sons of Shashi Bhusan long before 1965. Ext. 7(d) is a certified copy of a judgment dated 31-1-70 in Title Appeal No. 169 of 1965 which arose from Title Suit No. 126 of 1962 in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Noakhali. That suit was filed by one Golam Hossain (who is P.W.2 in the present suit) against one Mukhlesur Rahman and others impleading all the six sons of Shashi Bhushan as Proforma-defendants Nos. 4-9; proforma-defendant No. 9 was Hemendra and proforma- defendant No. 8 was his brother Dhirendra. Facts of that case are that Hemen­dra Kumar, while he was in exclusive possession of the suit land at Feni on the basis of an amicable par­tition, inducted Mukhlesur Rahman as a monthly ten­ant in a hut on a part of the suit land; on the ground of default of payment of rent Hemendra filed S.C.C." Suit No. 153 of 1960 in the 1st Court of Munsif, Feni, against Mukhlesur Rahman and obtained a de­cree for ejectment. But Mukhlesur Rahman did not vacate the hut. Hemendra then transferred pucca structures on the suit land to Golam Hossain, as mentioned above, by a registered kabala dated 26 Oc­tober 1961 claiming exclusive right and possession on the basis of the amicable partition. Golam Hos­sain then filed Title Suit No. 126 of 1962 against Mukhlesur Rahman impleading all the sons of Sha­shi Bhusan. Two of them namely, Hemendra and Dhirendra deposed in that case as P.Ws. 1 and 2 ad­mitting the amicable partition. The trial Court did not accept the claim of amicable partition and decreed the suit to the extent of 1/6 share that is, in respect of Hernendra's share only. But on appeal, the Addi­tional District Judge, Noakhali, by his judgment, Ext. 7(d) decreed the suit in full on a finding that there was an amicable partition by which the suit land at Feni fell exclusively to Hemendra's share. It is this judgment which is before us for consideration whether it is admissible under sections 13 and 43 of the Evidence Act and may be considered as evidence of the alleged amicable partition.<br/> <br/>7. Judgments, orders or decrees are relevant under ss. 40,41,42,43 and 44 of the Evidence Act. "Relevant" means and relates to, admissibility only. The question as to the evidentiary value of a judg­ment which is relevant is different from the question whether the judgment is admissible in evidence, be­cause it may be relevant, but its evidentiary value may be different in different cases; in some cases the evidentiary value is small and in other cases it may be conclusive evidence against the person who was party to the previous suit in which the judgment was passed. Under s. 40 a previous judgment, order or de­cree, is relevant to bar a second suit, that is, when such a judgment operates as <em>res Judicata</em> under s. 11 Civil P.C. Under section 41 a final judgment, order or de­cree of a competent court in the exercise of probate, matrimonial, admiralty or insolvency jurisdiction, is not only relevant but also is conclusive both against the parties thereto as well as against the rest of the world, that is, it is a judgment <em>in rem</em> as distin­guished from a judgment <em>in personam</em>. Under section 42 a judgment is relevant if it relates to any matter of public nature but it is not a conclusive proof of the fact it states. None of these sections, 40, 41 and 42, obviously is attracted to the instant case. It is sec­tion 43 which may be attracted to the instant case. It reads thus:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"43. Judgments etc., other than those men­tioned in sections 40 to 42, when relevant. Judgments, orders or decrees, other than those mentioned in sections 40, 41 and 42, are irrele­vant, unless the existence of such judgment, or­der or decree, is a fact in issue, or is relevant un­der some other provision of this Act."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>8. Mr. Pal contends that the judgment (Ext. 7d) in the previous suit is quite relevant in the in­stant case as the question whether there was an ami­cable partition among the sons of Shashi Bhusan in respect of the suit land is a material question for con­sideration in both the suits. Though the learned Judges of the High Court Division expressed grave doubt as to its very admissibility, Mr. Ranadhir Sen, learned Counsel for respondents No. 5, does not dispute that this judgment, Ext. 7(d), is relevant in the present suit; but he contends that its evidentiary val­ue is practically nil in that it is relevant only to show that a judgment like this is in existence and nothing more. He contends that though an amicable partition among the sons of Shashi Bhusan is a common question in the two suits, but the ques­tions have been decided in the two suits on different facts and circumstances and in different contexts, and though, in the previous suit, sons of Shashi Bhusan were parties, they are not so in the instant suit. Mr. Pal has, however, contended that a judgment, wheth­er inter parts or not, may be conclusive evidence against all persons of its own existence, date and le­gal effect, as distinguished from the accuracy of the decision rendered. In support of this contention he has referred to a number of decisions including a de­cision of the Pakistan Supreme Court in <em><strong>Malik Din v. Mohammad Aslam, 21 DLR SC 94, </strong></em>relevant portion of that judgment is quoted below:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Judgments, whether inter parties or not, are conclusive evidence for and against all persons whether parties, privies, or strangers of its own existence, date and legal effect, as distin­guished from the accuracy of the decision ren­dered. In other words, the law attributes uner­ring verity to the substantive as opposed to the judicial portions of the record. But where the judgment is inter parties; even recitals in such a judgment are admissible. A previous judgment is admissible also to prove statement or admis­sion or an acknowledgment made by a party or the predecessor-in-interest of a party, in his pleadings in a previous litigation. Similarly, a judgment narrating the substance of the plead­ings of the parties to litigation is admissible to establish the allegations made by them on that occasion."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In that case the plaintiff denied that the defen­dant had obtained an order of mutation from the Revenue Officer, but he was confronted with an or­der of the Collector which showed that in his appeal before the Collector in connection with an earlier mutation proceedings, he did not challenge the factum of mutation but had attacked the mutation on the ground that its basis—a gift—was void. The or­der of the Collector in the previous proceedings was held not only admissible in evidence for proving the fact about mutation, but also it was held to be bind­ing upon him as his statement in his own pleadings in the previous litigation.<br/> <br/>9. Other cases referred to by Mr. Pal in this connection are<em><strong> Tepu Khan v. Rajani Mohan Das, 2 CWN, 501; Govinda Narayan Singh v. Shamlal Singh, 58 Indian Appeals, 125; Maharaja Sir Kesho Prosad Singh v. Bahuria Mt. Bhagjogna Kuer and others, AIR 1937 PC 69.</strong></em> In the last mentioned case the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ob­served:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"A judgment is not admissible as evidence against one which is a stranger to the suit. But the judgment in a prior suit together with the plaint which preceded it and the steps in execu­tion which followed it are evidence of an asser­tion by the holder of a judgment of the right which he claims to acquire and are then admissible in evidence of his right. Such judgment is of great evidence even against third parties".</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>10. Mr. Pal has next submitted that s. 43 should be read with section 13 of the Evidence Act for ap­preciating the circumstances in which a judgment, though not inter parts, may be considered for exis­tence of any right or custom. Section 13 provides that where the question is as to the existence of any right or custom, certain facts are relevant, such as any 'transaction by which the right or custom in ques­tion was created, claimed, modified, recognised, as­serted or denied, arid 'particular instances' in which the right or custom claimed, recognised or asserted. Mr. Pal, relying on an observation of the Allahabad High Court made in <em><strong>Collector of Gorakhpur v. Palakdhari Singh (1889) All. 1, F.B.</strong></em> stated that the former judgments and decrees were not themselves a transaction or an instance within the meaning of sec­tion 13; but the suit in which they were made was a transaction or an instance in which the defendant's right of possession was claimed and recognised and that to establish that such transaction or instance took place they were the best evidence. The learned Judges of the High Court Division did not straightaway reject the previous judgment Ext. 7(d) as inad­missible but they were of the view that the proba­tive value of the judgment "is very small", firstly, because this judgment reversed that of the trial Court where the plaintiffs' title to the extent of only 1/6 share was declared, and secondly, this judgment itself is under appeal in Second Appeal No. 58 of 1972. With respect, we find that neither of these two rea­sons for deprecating the evidentiary value of Ext. 7 (d) is tenable. For, there hardly any distinction may be made between a judgment of affirmation and that of reversal, and secondly, the result of the second ap­peal which arose from the judgment in question is also not a matter for consideration at the time its admissibility and evidentiary value come up for con­sideration. However, it is now found that the second, appeal as referred to was dismissed and the judgment, Ext. 7(d) was upheld in due course was by a learned Single Judge who is a party to the impugned judgment before us in these appeals.<br/> <br/>11. In the previous judgment the present re­spondents were not parties, obviously because they came to the scene much later in consequence of the operation of the Enemy Property law. But the per­sons interested in the suit land namely, Hemendra and his brothers were parties. Be that as it may, the judgment Ext. 7(d) is not inter parties, and ordinarily a judgment cannot be used as evidence against a per­son who is a stranger thereto. But the judgment in a prior suit together with the plaint and other steps taken in connection therewith is evidence of an as­sertion by the holder of the judgment of the right which he claims to acquire and is then admissible in evidence of his right. Such right is of great evidence even against third parties, as has been held by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council already re­ferred to above. The simple fact is that the amicable partition of the same property of late Shashi Bhusan was the subject-matter in both the suits and as such the previous judgment showing the amicable parti­tion is certainly evidence in the present suit and it may be considered along with other evidence in the subsequent suit. Evidence of P.Ws. 1 and 2 goes to establish Hemendra's exclusive title by an amicable partition long before the Indo-Pak War of 1965. P.W. 2, as already mentioned before, is Golam Hossain who was plaintiff of the previous suit claiming a part of the suit land on the basis of purchase from Hemendra by a registered kabala of 1961. The basis of that registered kabala was the same partition of Shashi Bhusan's property; he has supported the present plaintiffs' claim of partition. P.W. 1 is one of the plaintiffs-appellants; he has deposed from his own knowledge about the partition. Their oral evi­dence has been rejected by the learned Judges, as ac­cording to them, they are "thoroughly incompetent" in that they were not present at the time of parti­tion. The partition, it may be remembered, took place some time in 1946, after the death of Shashi Bhusan. These P.Ws. came to the scene much later. They may not have been present during the talk of partition but they cannot be said to be incompetent. They have come from the same locality having par­ticular knowledge about the property of which they subsequently purchased. The claim of amicable par­tition was made even before Golam Hossain's pur­chase in 1961, for in a much earlier suit, S.C.C. Suit No. 153 of 1960, Hemendra had put up the same claim on the basis of the amicable partition and became successful. In the light of these facts and circumstances, we are of the view that the previous judgment Ext. 7(d) was not given the consideration it deserves by the learned Judges whose decision there­fore cannot be sustainable both in fact and law.<br/> <br/>12. Much arguments have been led on Ext. 16, the Photostat copy of a declaration purport­edly made by four brothers of Hemendra who resided in Calcutta. It says that they declared before the Pa­kistan High Commissioner at Calcutta that there was an amicable partition among them and their other brothers by which the property at Feni fell to the share of Hemendra. When the Photostat copy was filed as evidence before the Court no objection was raised as to its admissibility without proof. But subsequently its admissibility was challenged on the ground that the original was not produced nor any reason for non-production was given. The learned Judges have observed that "Ext. 16 was simply pro­duced before the Court and marked an exhibit; it is not such a document which could be received in evi­dence without formal proof; therefore, we are clearly of the opinion that secondary evidence e.g. Photostat copy, which is not even proved legally, could not be admissible in evidence."<br/> <br/>13. Mr. Pal has contended that the objection as to formal proof of Ext. 16 was to be taken at the earliest point of time, that is, when it was sought to be admitted but its admissibility not having been ob­jected to, the defendants are debarred from raising this objection now. In support of this contention he has relied upon a decision of the Pakistan Supreme Court in <em><strong>Abdullah and others V. Abdul Karim and others, 20 DLR SC 205</strong></em> where it has been observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"The Code of Civil Procedure provides for the admission of documents and it is now well settled that if objection to the formal proof of a document has not been taken at the earliest point of time it cannot be taken subsequently and certainly not in appeal."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Mr. Ranadhir Sen hardly finds anything to dis­pute this proposition of law as to admissibility of a document, but he contends that this principle is not applicable to the case of a document which is per se inadmissible and that in the instant case no explana­tion was given why the original was not produced. Mr. Sen has pointed out that it is not known who ac­tually produced it before court, particularly when no witness has been examined on this point excepting that this document was filed by the plaintiffs.<br/> <br/>14. Secondary evidence of a document is ad­missible in the cases specifically mentioned in s. 65 of the Evidence Act and if the original is not availa­ble, reason for non-availability must be given. It ap­pears that at the time the Photostat copy was filed no objection was taken as to its formal proof. The dec­laration though made in 1963 was not referred to in the previous judgment Ext. 7(d) dated 31 January 1970. The learned Judges discarded it for another rea­son which, according to them, is that its' contents are materially inconsistent with the plaint case. The learned Judges did not, however, point at any incon­sistent statement between the two documents. Be that as it may, the question as to merit of this document, Ext. 16, will arise only if it is found to be admissible in evidence without formal proof. We think that though objection was not raised when it was pro­duced, the party producing it was not exempted from explaining in the course of recording evidence why its original was not produced. Even assuming this is not admissible in evidence, the appellants' case of amicable partition stands independent of Ext. 16 as other evidence and circumstances including the previ­ous judgment are quite sufficient to prove it. An am­icable partition like this between brothers-co-sharers need not be affected by a registered instrument, as Mr. Pal has rightly referred to the decision in the case of <em><strong>Nani Bai V. Gita Bai, AIR 1958 SC 70.</strong></em><br/> <br/>15. In the result, both the appeals are allowed with costs. The impugned judgment of the High Court Division is set aside and that of the trial Court is restored.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
