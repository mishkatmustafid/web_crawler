Claiming that the house property at 2/11 Block 'A', Sir Syed Ahmed Road, PS Mohammad­pur, Dhaka was the subject matter of an agreement of sale or 7.1.71 between Dr. Sadrul Hasan, the then owner thereof and the petitioner and further claiming that the petitioner obtained an ex parte decree on 11.4.83 in a suit for specific performance of contract, namely, Title Suit No. 1441 of 1981 from the 4th Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka against the said Dr. Sadrul Hasan and that the petitioner obtained a deed of sale through Court in execution thereof, the petitioner challenged the inclusion of the said property in list, 'Ka' under section 5(1)(a) of Ordinance No. 54 of 1985 before the Court of Settlement, respondent No. 1, in Case No. 794 of 1987.<br/> <br/>3. Respondent No. 1 by its judgment dated 6.8.88 accepted the contention of the respondent ­Government that Dr. Sadrul Hasan was not present in this country both during and after the liberation of the country, that the property was declared as an abandoned property, that the Government possessed it through its allottees, that the alleged agreement dated 7.1.71 is an ante‑dated agreement and that the petitioner obtained an ex parte decree in respect of an abandoned property which is inexecutable.<br/> <br/>4. The High Court Division being moved against the said judgment, discharged the Rule Nisi upon agreeing with respondent No. 1 in its material findings and further holding that the suit of the petitioner was barred by limitation under Article 113 of the Limitation Act.<br/> <br/>5. Mr. Moksumul Hakim, learned Counsel for the petitioner, submits that it was not taken into consideration that the Government-defendant filed Miscellaneous Case No. 16 of 1985 under Order 9, rule 13, CPC against the ex parte decree dated 11.4.83 which was pending on the date of publication of the petitioner's property in the 'Ka' list. He submits that die proviso (b) to section 5(l) of Ordinance No. 54 of 1985 provides that no such list shall include any building in respect of which, inter alia, an application was pending before any Court.<br/> <br/>6. The submission has no substance. The suit, appeal or application pending on the date of publication must be of a stated type. Mr. Hakim failed to show that either the suit or the misc. case answered the description given in the said proviso.<br/> <br/>7. Mr. Hakim submits next that the High Court Division failed to consider that if the aforesaid Miscellaneous Case No. 16 of 1985 is disposed of either way, there will be possibility of conflict between a decree of a civil Court and a judgment of the Court of Settlement.<br/> <br/>8. This submission is devoid of substance. The Court of Settlement has held that the building is an abandoned property, that it has vested in the Government under President's Order No. 16 1972 and that the petitioner has no right or interest in the building. The High Court Division has confirmed this finding. The ex parte decree and the miscellaneous case are valueless under the circumstances.<br/> <br/>9. Mr. Hakim next submits that the Court of Settlement disposed of the matter in a summary way and its conclusions are far from satisfactory, which the High Court Division failed to notice.<br/> <br/>10. So long as the Court of Settlement acts  within jurisdiction and does not commit any excess of jurisdiction the High Court Division will be right in not interfering on the ground of mere unsatisfactory disposal of a case.<br/> <br/>11. Mr. Hakim then draws our attention to clause 2 of the agreement dated 7.1.71 between Dr. Sadrul Hasan and the petitioner and submits that the vendor had time upto 7.1.81 to execute and register the deed of sale and the petitioner had time upto 7.1.84 to file the suit She filed the suit on 14.12.81 Hence the suit was not barred by limitation.<br/> <br/>12. This argument is not available to the petitioner as neither either plaint of the suit nor the agreement was produced before the Court of Settlement or before the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>13. No other ground or point has been urged by Mr. Hakim.<br/> <br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
