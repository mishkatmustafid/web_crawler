Both the District Judge as well as the learned Judges of the High Court Division are of the view that the Second Miscellaneous Appeal abated as a whole and is under question.<br/> <br/>2. Facts for disposal of this appeal are that the respondent brought a suit for declar­ation of title and recovery of possession of a certain property. The suit contested by different sets of defendants was decreed by the trial Court. The appellants along with others since deceased, having preferred an appeal against the said judgment, the suit was rema­nded to the trial Court for deciding the point of limitation. The appellants and the other defendants preferred an appeal against the order of remand to the High Court Division being S. M. A. No. 12 of 1968. It appears that while the said appeal was pending in the High Court Division 4 defendant- appellants died out no substitution of their heirs was made in the appeal. The miscellaneous appeal was however heard and was allowed and the order of remand was set aside by the High Court Division with a direction that the Court of Appeal below should remit only the issue of limitation to the trial Court for a finding under Order 41, rule 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure keeping the appeal pending there. When the records were received back in the Court of Appeal below an application was made on behalf of the appellants for substitu­tion of the heirs of the deceased appellants, who died during the pendency of the second miscellaneous appeal in the High Court Divi­sion, on setting aside the abatement.<br/> <br/>3. The learned District Judge was of the view that the deceased appellants having died, during the pendency of the miscellaneous appeal in the High Court Division the said appeal abated, and until unless the abatement of the appeal was set aside the Court of appeal below had no power to substitute and so dismissed the application for substitution. The High Court Division which moved under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure against the order also took the view that be­cause of non-substitution of the heirs of the deceased appellants the second miscellaneous appeal had abated as a whole.<br/> <br/>4. Mr. M.H. Khondker, learned Counsel appearing for the appellants submits that the learned Judges of the High Court Division solely concentrated on the question of abatement arising from the provision of Order 22 of the Code, but did not consider the provisions of Order 41 rules 4 and 33 of the Code. We think there is substance in what learned Advo­cate says. It is so be observed that we are deciding a narrow   question involved on the facts of the present appeal in that, in a suit for declaration of title and recovery of posses­sion by the plaintiff against a multitude of defendants an appeal arises out of an order of remand passed by the Court of appeal below to the High Court Division where some of the defendant-appellants had died and were not substituted whether the appeal abated as a whole. To test this principle substance of rules 4 and 33 of Order 41 of the Code requires to be looked into. Bereft of provisions not material for the disposal of this appeal, rule 4 says that where there are more 'plaintiffs or defendants than one in a suit and the decree appealed from proceeds on any ground com­mon to all the plaintiffs, or to all the defen­dants may appeal from the whole decree, and thereupon the Appellate Court may reverse or vary the decree in favour of all the plain­tiffs or defendants, as the case may be. This rule is supplemented by rule 33 which says that the Appellate Court shall have power to pass any decree and make any or­der which ought to have been passed or made to pass or as the case may require and this power may be exercised by the Court not­withstanding that the appeal is as to part only of the decree and may be exercised in favour of all or any of the respondents or parties, although such respondents or parties may not have filed any appeal or objection.<br/> <br/>5. The provisions of the two rules set out above clearly indicate, that any one of the defendants where there are more than one could appeal if there is a common ground against the plaintiff who has obtained the decree. The rules equally apply to the plaintiffs but we are not concerned with them here. To revert to rule 33, it appears that the Appellate Court can pass any effective decree even if the appeal is against a part of the decree and in varying the decree may pass an order in favour of the respondents or parties who might not have appeal. In a case of this nature it is to be seen if the appeal is heard without the   substitu­tion of the heirs of the deceased-appellants, whether it will result in bringing about two in consistent decrees in the same suit, one passed by the Court below and the other by the Appellate Court and when there is no such conflict the appeal shall not abate as a whole. Is there any chance of coming into existence two conflicting decrees on account of passing of the order of the High Court Division setting aside the order of remand of the lower Appellate Court and remanding the appeal to that Court with certain direction. The appeal being against the or­der of remand passed by the Court of appeal below, there is no question of two inconsistent decrees coming into existence.<br/> <br/>6. Apart from this, rule 4 of Order 41 says that any one of the defendants can make an appeal if there are more than one defendant and there is any common ground to all the defendants. The record shows the defendant-appellants who are alive have the common ground to the deceased defendant-appellants against the plaintiff-respondent. The appeal could and should have proceeded minus the deceased defendants. The latter part of Rule 4 read with Rule 33 does indi­cate that in such a case the Appellate Court has full power to reverse or vary the decree in favour of the plaintiffs or defen­dants as the case may be, even though such respondents or parties may not have filed an appeal.<br/> <br/>7. It is to be remembered that on the death of a non-substituted appellant, the appeal against him abates, and it is to be taken that he has not appealed, but under Rule 4 the other defendant-appellants are entitled to make an appeal and carry it to conclusion.  Therefore, the defendants-ap­pellants who were not dead could carry the appeal to its conclusion, and since no questions of two conflicting decrees coming into exis­tence arise, this is a fit case where provisions of rules 4 and 33 of Order 41 of the Code will apply. The appeal cannot be deemed to have abated as a whole, and the order passed in appeal by the High Court Division   shall ensure to the benefit of all the appellants.<br/> <br/>8. On the setting aside of the  order of the Lower Appellate Court by the High Court Division the appeal before the lower Appel­late Court became pending and after arrival of the records, an opportunity for substitution of the heirs of the dead appellants was available to the party concerned. The learned District Judge was wrong in rejecting the prayer for substitution of the supposition that the appeal had abated as a whole. The suit being for recovery of possession and there being the possibility of two inconsistent de­crees coming   into existence substitution is necessary.<br/> <br/>9. For the reasons stated above we allow the appeal without any order as to costs and set aside the orders of the High Court Division and the first Appellate Court, and send the case back on remand to the Court of appeal below to dispose of the appeal in terms of the earlier order of remand passed by the High Court Division. Let the matter be disposed of expeditiously.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
