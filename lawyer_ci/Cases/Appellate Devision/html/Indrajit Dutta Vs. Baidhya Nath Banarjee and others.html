Abdul Matin J:</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment dated 10.09.2007 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 2756 of 1995 discharging the Rule.<br/> <br/>2. The facts, in short, are that the respondents as plaintiff’s instituted title Suit No.141 of 1983 before the First Court of Munsif, Bangerhat which was renumbered as Title Suit No. 245 of 1990 in the court of 1st Additional Court of learned Assistant Judge, Bagerhat. In this suit the plaintiff prayed for declaration that the judgment and decree dated 13.04.1979 of passed on compromise in Title Suit No.340 of 1978 is fraudulent, collusive and not binding upon them. The plaintiff’s case is that the said compromise decree was obtained in T.S. No. 340 of 1978 by suppressing of process and by false personation, without impleding them as party though they have right, title, interest in the suit property. They learnt about the said decree on 30.01.1983. Since they were not implicated as party in that suit the alleged compromise decree is not binding upon them and hence the suit.<br/> <br/>3. The respondent as defendant No.1 appeared in the suit and contested the suit by filing written statement alleging, inter alia, that compromise decree is genuine and valid and same is not liable to be set aside that the plaintiffs have no locus standi to file this suit.<br/> <br/>4. The trail court dismissed the suit and on appeal the appellate court set aside the judgment and decree of the trail court and decreed the suit. The revisional court i.e. the High Court Division upheld the judg­ment and decree of the appellate court and discharged the Rule and hence this peti­tion for leave to appeal.<br/> <br/>5. Heard the learned Counsel and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/> <br/>6. It appears that the High Court Division considered that the plaintiffs are the recorded tenants in respect of the suit land and the plaintiff No. 4 paid rent as per exhibit-4 series. The High court Division also considered the original power of attorney authenticated by a notary public which was exhibited by the plaintiff appointing Modhusudhan as the attorney. The appellate court and the High Court Division believed the heba deed dated 13.01,1982 in favour of the plaintiff No.2. The High Court Division further consid­ered that the present petitioner could not prove the oral settlement nor produced any rent receipts.<br/> <br/>7. It appears that in the earlier suit the plaintiffs were not parties and therefore they are not bound by the earlier decree.<br/> <br/>8.  In such view of the matter the High Court Division was right in discharging the Rule and affirming the judgment and decree of the appellate court.<br/> <br/>We find no substance in this petition which is accordingly dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
