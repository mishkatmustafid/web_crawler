The pre-emptor filed the case on 4.8.77 on the averments that vendor-respondent No.1 sold the land to respon­dent No. 2 by a kabala which was executed on 16.5.77 and registered on 14.11.77. The pre-emptor was a co-sharer and no notice of transfer was served on him and that he has filed the case for pre-emption within 4 (four) months from the date of knowledge and he has land which added with the land under pre-emption would not exceed 100 big has.<br/> <br/>3. Respondent No.1 filed a written objection contending that the case is not maintainable in law and also bad for defect of parties inasmuch as many of the record­ed co-sharers have not been made parties and that the property which was transferred by the kabala executed on 16.5.77 and reg­istered on 14.11.77 has already been trans­ferred to him by the respondent No. 5 on 18.2.78 on the basis of registered deed of agreement for reconveyance executed 16.5.77 and as such the appellants cannot claimed pre-emption.<br/> <br/>4. The trial court dismissed the Miscellaneous Case on the ground of defect of parties, the appellate court below, the District Judge, Madaripur allowed the appeal of the pre-emptor and allowed the pre-emption. A learned Single Judge in revision made the Rule absolute and dis­missed the pre-emption case.<br/> <br/>5. From the materials on record it is found that the pre-emptor on 22.4.78 filed some interrogatories before the trial court requiring respondent No.1 to answer some specific questions in the matter of deed of reconveyance dated 18.2.78. After taking several adjournments the respondents failed to answer the interrogatories and as such the trial court debarred the respondents from leading evidence in respect of the deed of reconveyane dated 18.2.78 against which order the respondents filed a Civil Revision before the High Court Division. The High Court Division set aside the order passed by the trial court on condition that the vendor-respondent No.1 shall pay to the appellant an amount of Tk.100/- in course of 3 weeks from the arrival of the records in the court below failing which the Rule shall stand discharged and the order of the trial court will be maintained. Respondent No.1 did not deposit the said sum as directed by the High Court Division. As such the respondents were barred from giving any evidence with regard to the deed of reconveyance.<br/> <br/>6. The learned Single Judge of the High Court Division accepted it to be true that respondent No.1 was debarred from lead­ing any evidence on the deed of reconveyance, but he took the view that it was nothing but a penalty which was confined to leading evidence in support of the deed of reconveyance. The learned Single Judge further held that the written objection of respondent No. 1 and the deed of recon­veyance dated 18.2.78 cannot be left out of consideration because the same were not excluded by the order of the trial court. Relying on the written objection and the deed of reconveyance the learned Single Judge held that the pre-emption case became infructuous and the appellants' right of pre-emption was extinguished as soon as the reconveyance was made.<br/> <br/>7. Leave was granted to consider the following submissions of Mr. Khondker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, learned Advocate for the pre-emptor-appellants:<br/> <br/>8. First, the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division erred in law in taking into consideration the written objection of respondent No. 1 with regard to the deed of reconveyance dated 18.2.78 because a writ­ten objections is not evidence. Secondly, the deed of reconveyance dated 18.2.78 was never filed or proved before the trial court and it was never an Exhibit in the case. Thirdly, the finding of the High Court Division has been arrived at in violation of the previsions of section 30 read with Order 11 Rule 21 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Lastly, the High Court Division also failed to notice that the lower appellate court dis­believed the fact of alleged recoveyance on merit.<br/> <br/>9. Mr. Mahmudul Islam, learned Advocate does not support the grounds on which the high Court Division made the Rule absolute. His main contention is that the pre-emption case cannot succeed because of defect of parties as found by the trial court and wrongly rejected by the appellate court. He further submits that the High Court Division did not at all consider this vital issue on the question of defect of parties although that was the first ground before the High Court Division. His main contention is that the miscellaneous case should be dismissed only on the around of defect of parties. The learned Subordinate Judge found that some of the S.A. recorded tenants have not been made parties and brushed aside, for want of proof, the con­tention of the appellant that those recorded tenants have no subsisting interest in the holding in question. This objection as to non-joinder of co-sharers was specifically raised in the written objection and in spite of that objection some of the co-sharers have not been impleaded which is legally fatal for the maintainability of the pre-emption petition.<br/> <br/>10. He further submits that the legal consequence of non-impleading of the admitted co-sharers in the Khatian is a vital omission for which the pre-emption appli­cation is not maintainable.<br/> <br/>11. Mr. Mahmudul Islam without dis­puting the grounds on which leave was granted submitted that the application for pre-emption was liable to be dismissed on the ground of defect of parties only. He sub­mits that this aspect was over looked by the lower appellate court as well as by the High Court Davison.<br/> <br/>12. Mr. Mahmudul Islam, learned Advocate placed before us the case of <strong><em>Akhtarun Nessa and another Vs. Habibullah and ors</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>31 DLR (AD) 88</em></strong> and the case of <strong><em>Abdus Samad &amp; ors Vs. Md. Sohrab Ali and others</em></strong> report­ed in <strong><em>33 DLR (AD) 113</em></strong>, wherein it is found that the co-sharers having not been impleaded in the application of pre-emption the application is not legally maintainable. As a matter of fact, some of the S.A. record­ed tenants as appeared from the khatian filed in this case have been omitted. In view of the legal position the application for pre­emption was not legally maintainable for non-impleading necessary parties in the pre-emption proceeding. Consequently, the appeal is dismissed without any order as to cost.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
