Respondents Nos. 1-8 instituted Title Suit No. P4 of 1959 in the Court of Munsif, 1st Court, Moulvibazar, against the Predecessor of tie appellants as defendant No. 49 and others praying for declaration of their title in the suit land and for khas possession of their share on partition.<br/> <br/>3. Main contesting defendant in the suit was defendant No. 49, who by filing separ­ate, written statements; contended that the first schedule of land of the written-statement was owned by him by virtue of purchase from one Mukhyadamoyee and others, and since pur­chase he is in possession thereof by paying rent to the landlord. He further contended that the second schedule of the land of the written-statement was taken by settlement from Tarani, plaintiff No, 6. On the basis of such purchase and settlement he is in posse­ssion of the suit land. Subsequently, plaintiff no. 1 demanded rent from this defendant on behalf of plaintiff No. 6 and on refusal to that the suit has been instituted out of grudge. The trial court observed:<br/> <br/>"P.W.1 the plaintiff No. 1 has clearly stared in cross-examination that the defend­ants alleged first schedule land of W. S. does not appertain to the disputed lands."<br/> <br/>Accordingly it excluded the first schedule land by observing:<br/> <br/>"Thus this land claimed by the defend­ant No. 49 goes out of the consid­eration for the present suit land as the plffs have no claim for this."<br/> <br/>4. The learned Munsif, however, rejected the claim of settlement in so far as the second schedule is concerned. The learned Munsif, however, while drawing up the dec­ree did not leave out the first schedule land of the written-statement of defendant No. 49, from the suit land to be partitioned. The Pleader Commissioner was appointed for the purpose of effecting partition who did not leave out the first schedule land of the written-statement of defendant No. 49 from partition and allotted it to the saham of the plaintiffs and the final decree was made accordingly on 20.7.63.<br/> <br/>5. Defendant No. 49 preferred Title Ap­peal No. 438 of 1963 from the said final decr­ee. The learned Subordinate Judge while noticing the objection of defendant No. 49 observed thus the preliminary decree had made the entire suit land liable to partition and no appeals was taken against the prel­iminary decree in respect of the claim of defendant No. 49 regarding first schedule land of the written statement. It was observed:<br/> <br/>“So, no action can be taken not at thus stage which may in any way affect the preliminary decree. A judgment cannot be interpreted to mean something other than what has been clearly decreed by the court. The final decree was in terms of the preliminary decree. So, I find no scope for interference with the final decree."<br/> <br/>In this view of the matter, the appeal was dismissed.<br/> <br/>6. In second appeal, the High Court Di­vision took the same view by observing:<br/> <br/>"This prayer cannot be granted at this stage unless the preliminary decree is set aside. In the preliminary decree the entire Suitland was decreed to be partiti­oned among the co-sharers. No appeal was referred against the preliminary dec­ree. Hence there is no point in remanding the case for relayment of the kabala of the defendant after nearly 20 years."<br/> <br/>In this view of the matter, the second appeal was dismissed.<br/> <br/>7. Leave was granted to consider the que­stion in the context that the property in schedule 1 of the written-statement did not appertain to the lands In suit since the plaintiff had not claimed for the same, bat through mistake the said first schedule land was not excluded from the preliminary decree for partition and the Pleader Commissioner allotted the said land to the plaintiff and the final decree was pasted thereon. The contention of the learned Counsel was that the High Court Division erred in law in holding that the preliminary decree cannot be corrected and modified in the appeal against the final decree.<br/> <br/>8. Mr. M. H. Khandker, learned Cou­nsel, appearing for the appellants, pointed out that the Appellate Court below had erroneously taken the view of the law when it said that a judgment cannot be interp­reted to mean something other than what has been clearly decreed by the court. Mr. Khandker argued forcefully that this is a wrong view of the law and placed reliance on section 2 and Order 20 and rule 6 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/> <br/>9. Mr. B. N. Chowdhury, learned Coun­sel, appearing for the respondents, argued on section 97 of the Code of Civil Proce­dure and submitted that the courts below have correctly refused to emend the decree since no appeal had been filed against the preliminary decree. Since an important question of law has been raised we allowed the learned Ad­vocate to address the Court folly as it was a case of first impression.<br/> <br/>10. Section 2(2) defines decree means the formal expression of an adjudication which, so far as regards the Court ex­pressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regards to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit and may be either preliminary of find. “The explanation adds; "A decree is preliminary when further proceedings have 10 be taken before the suit can be com­pletely disposed of, It is final when such adjudication completely disposes of the suit. II may be partly preliminary and partly final."<br/> <br/>11. Order 20 deals with judgment and decree. Rule 6(1) provides: "The decree shall agree wife the judgment; it shall contain the number of the suit, the names and descrip­tions of the parties, and particulars of the claim, and shall specify clearly the relief granted or other determination of the suit."<br/> <br/>12. Mr. M. H. Khondker argued that the Appellate Court below was palpably wrong when it said, ''a judgment cannot be interpreted to mean something other than what has been clearly decreed by the court." There is no hesitation in saying that the App­ellate Court below erroneously interpreted the law and the law is that the decree shall agree with the judgment. It has been noticed by both the Appellate Court and the High Court Division that the learned Munsif exclu­ded the first schedule land of the written sta­tement from the suit and therefore, by no stretch of imagination it could be said that such land is liable to be partitioned when the trial court in its judgment excluded the land from the purview of the suit itself. It needs little imagination to say that this must have been the result of mistake. If it is a case of mistake, as it has been accepted by the courts below, then the only question is whe­ther such mistake could not be rectified by taking resort to the provision of section 151 or 152 C.P.C. The Appellate Court below and the High Court Division found the impe­diment in doing so, because of presence of sec­tion 97 C.P.C, Section 97 reads as follows:<br/> <br/>"Where any party aggrieved by a preli­minary decree passed after the commencement of this Code does not appeal from such decree, it shall be precluded from disputing its correctness in any appeal which may be preferred from the final decree."<br/> <br/>13. Mr. B.N. Chowdhury, learned Coun­sel, appearing for the respondents, contended that since the appellants did not file any appeal against the preliminary decree he is now precluded from disputing its correctness, Reliance was placed on the decision reported in <strong>A.I.R 1961(S.C).790, 42 IA 91. AIR 1965 (S.C.) 1325.</strong> The latter decision however explains the scope and ambit of section 97 C.P.C. and the other two decisions laid down the proposition that when no appeal is filed against preliminary decree, the same cannot be challenged after the final decree. These two decisions have no manner of application in the facts of the present case.<br/> <br/>14. The Code defines decree in section 2 (2) which conclusively determine the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit. (Emphasis added). The trial court expressly excluded the first schedule land of the written-statement, in as much as, the plaintiff has no claim for this. It observed:<br/> <br/>“Thus this land claimed by the defendant No. 49 goes out of the consideration for the present suit and as the plaintiffs have no claim for this.”<br/> <br/>This was also noticed by the Appellate Court because the plaintiff did not claim it. Even then the Courts below have found it difficult to accede to the prayer of the app­ellants. This first schedule land of written-statement was never in controversy in the suit and the mistake crept in while drawing up the decree.<br/> <br/>15. The question is whether the decree could be amended even now. As far back in 1882 the Court of Appeal in England in<em><strong> Inre Swire Mellor vs. Swire reported in LR 1885 (C.D) 239 </strong></em>this point was considered. <strong>Gotten L. J.</strong> observed:<br/> <br/>"The Court will not allow an order to stand which does not express what the Court intended, an order containing a declaration on a point which was nod before the Court at all."<br/> <br/>In that case, the question was whether cer­tain property was included in the decree. The Court allowed the amendment by saying:<br/> <br/>"Therefore, in my opinion, we ought to strike out from the order as pasted and entered the words, "and proceeds of investment of profits" and also toe reference to the collieries in which the tes­tator was not interested at the time of his death, as they relate to what was no part of the matter then before us, and therefore, do not express our judgment."<br/>Accordingly the decree was amended. The Court further noticed; ''we are not now making anew order on the appeal, but simply ame­nding the record because it doss not corr­ectly state what the order of the Court was,"<br/> <br/>16. A similar question came before the House of Lords in the case of <em><strong>Henry</strong></em> <em><strong>William Hatton V Hugh Harris </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> 1892 LR (AC) 547. </strong></em>It was argued that forty years have passed since the decree came, after such a lapse of time the decree must stand, whether it is right or wrong; it cannot be touched now. This contention was repelled and <strong>Lord Macnaghteo</strong> observed:<br/> <br/>“I am of the opinion that there is a mistake in the decree of 1853, occasioned by an accidental omission and that mistake ought to have been corrected as a matter of course.<br/> <br/>Retort was taken to the provision of General Order of 1843 which provides that any clerical mistake in a decree or any error arising from an accidental slip or omission may at any time be corrected on an application and accordin­gly in that case the decree was corrected, "because that mistake ought to have been corrected as a matter of course."<br/> <br/>17. In <em><strong>Seth Manakchand. Vs. Chaube Manoharlal and another </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> 48 CWN 435 </strong></em>the Privy Council considered the question and observed:<br/> <br/>"The question was what the decree me­ant and in interpreting the decree no document was so directly in point as the judgment, Where the judgment expressly said that the Appellant's interests were not affected, it was a mistake in method to read the general words of the decree as covering those very interests by reference to the mortgage deed and erroneous to direct execution of the decree passed in the absence of the Appellant, so as to affect his interests.<br/> <br/>In that case the question was whether the respondents are entitled to recover possession from the appellant for four annas share in a village called Chipabad. The Privy Council considered that the appellant was no party to the proceeding as he claimed paramount title. It was viewed that a party who is dismissed from the suit on the ground that he has no concern with it, he is no longer a party to the suit and he is not bound by the decree. The Privy Council, therefore, held that the order to eject the appellant was irregular and unjustified, inasmuch as, his Interests were not affected and it was a mere mistake in drawing up the decree.<br/> <br/>18. In <em><strong>R.M.K.R.M. Somasundaram Chetty vs. M. R. M. V. L. Subramaniam Chetty </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> AIR 1926 (PC.) 136</strong></em> the Privy Council re-it­erated the principle as follows:<br/>"The only cases in which the Court can interfere after the passing and entering of the judgment are (1) where there have bests an accident or slip in the judgment as drawn up, in which case the Court has power to rectify it; and (2) where the Court itself finds the judgment as drawn up does not correctly state what the Court actually decided and inten­ded."<br/> <br/>19. Coming to the Indian subcontinent in the case of <em><strong>C. K. Mukhopadya vs. S. M. B. Debi </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> AIR 1924 (Cat) 895</strong></em> it will be seen that the Calcutta High Court took consistent view that the Court by taking resort to section 152 C-P.C. can amend decree to conform to the judgment at any time and there is no time limit to such amendment. In that case, in a partition suit Commissioner was appointed for allotting the shares. The dispute was between defendant No. 8 who was a peti­tioner and defendant No. 7, the opposite party. The two plots allotted to those defendants were contiguous. It was agreed that defendant No. 8, the petitioner, should give a road over his plot No. 8 to defendant No. 7 and in ex­change got a 2 feet wide strip of land east to west being the northern portion of plot No. 7. All these terms were embodied in the judgment. The decree, however, though it mentioned that a way will be kept over plot No. 8 for access to plot No. 7 from the north, did not mention the 2 cubits wide strip of land to be allotted to defendant No 8, The defendant No, 8 accordingly applied to have that clause Inserted in the decree and to make it conform to the judgment. The Division Bench after reviewing the decision noticed that the preponderance of opinion in the subcontinent and also in England Is that it is the duty of the Court to amend the decree when it is brought to its notice that it dose not agree with the judgment. The necessary amendments were made in that case<br/> <br/>20. Even a decree was amended after de­termination of the appeal to the Privy Council. In <em><strong>Ahidhar Ghosh Vs The Secretary of the State </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> 36 CWN 665 </strong></em>the Calcutta High Court noticed that the judgment of the High Court had been affirmed by the Privy Council and after the disposal of the Privy Council the appellant for the first time discov­ered that in the High Court decree against him the item of court fees paid by the other side on their memorandum of appeal to the High Court had been included twice in the costs. <strong>Rankin, C. J.</strong> considered tie question that "the memorandum of appeal of the High Court had been included twice over in the decree drawn up and signed by the Judges of the High Court. The said mistake being discovered at this stage had not been made one of the grounds of the appeal to the Privy Council." The Court found precedent for such amendment by correcting the mistake and found that in a previous appeal before the Privy Council a mistake was detected after its disposal and that mistake was rec­tified by the Calcutta High Court and acco­rdingly, the Court ordered:<br/> <br/>"Let the decree of this Court be am­ended by correcting the mistake as prayed for in the petition."<br/> <br/>21. In <em><strong>Khandesh Laxmi Villas Mills Co. Ltd. V. Graduate Coal Concern Jalgaon </strong></em>repo­rted in<em><strong> 59 ILR (Bombay) 158 </strong></em>a decree was amended by the trial Court under section 152 so as to bring the name of the applicant upon the decree as judgment debtor. It was contended that the learned Subordinate Judge had no jurisdiction to amend the final decree at this stage of the proceeding since ha was <em>functus officio</em>. The Bombay High Court repelled the contention and upheld the order of the trial Court for amending the decree "in such a way as to bring it into con­formity with the meaning of the Court which ordered the decree to be passed,"<br/> <br/>22. It is not necessary to multiply inst­ances when the various High Courts of India had taken uniform view that the Court can always amend the decree if there is a mistake that had crept in for bringing the decree in conformity with the judgment.<br/> <br/>23. In <em><strong>C.P. No. 80 of 1974 Mahabubul Huq Vs. Abdul Huq </strong></em>this Court approved the order of the learned Munsif when he vacated his earlier order when the mistake that occu­rred due to the lapse of the dealing assi­stant. The High Court affirmed the order as having been made under section 152 C.P.C. and this Court observed "the impugned order was passed in the ends of justice so that the defendants should not be made to suffer for no fault of their own. The impugned order merely restore the matter to where it was before the order No. 3 was passed due to the fault of the Court.''<br/> <br/>24. Applying these principles we have no hesitation that it was a clear case of mistake which had crept in drawing up the decree when the judgment of the trial Court expressly excluded the first schedule of the written-statement belonging to defendant No. 49, who is the appellant before us. That pro­perty was never in “controversy in the suit" and the plaintiffs did not claim that property. When this is the position then a clear case of mistake is made out and keeping in mind the consistent judicial pronounce meat since 1882 we have no hesitation in saying that the decree is liable Co be amended by excluding the first schedule of the written-statement of tae app­ellant by taking resort to the provision of sec­tion 152 C.P.C.<br/> <br/>25. Section 97 C P. S. Case no manner of application in the facts of this case, We are respectfully in agreement with the Supreme Court of India when it said in <em><strong>Chittoori Subban a Vs. Kudapa Subbanna</strong></em> and others repot­ted in <em><strong>AIR 1965 (SC) 1325 (1332)</strong></em> that the object of section 97 is that questions which had been urged by the parties and decided by the Court at the stage-of the prelimi­nary decree will not be open for re agitation at the stage of the preparation of the final decree and would be taken as finally decided if no appeal had bean preferred against the prel­iminary decree. In the present case as has been noticed that schedule 1 of the written statement was expressly excluded form the adjudication and therefore, it could not be a matter which was decided by the Court at the stage of preliminary decree. As such sec­tion 97 has no application.<br/> <br/>26. Accordingly, we allow this appeal and set aside the judgments of the Courts below and direct the trial Court to amend the decree so as to bring it in conformity with the Judgment by excluding first schedule land of the written-statement of the appellant, who figured as defendant No. 49 in the partition suit.<br/> <br/>In the result, therefore, this appeals as allowed. There will be do order as to costs.<br/> <br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
