A No. 665 of 1968).<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></div> <div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fazle Munim J:</strong>This appeal arises from the judgment of a Single Judge of the High Court Division passed in Second Appeal No. 665 of 1968 on August 3, 1979.<br/> <br/>2. The predecessor of respondent Nos. 1 to 7 instituted O.C. Suit No. 61 of 1965 for declaration that the suit land appertained to his original C.S. khatian No. 27 and that the property recorded in the new Khatian No. 23 in the name of defendant No. 1 was wrongly prepared and that the same is liable to be recorded in his name in the rent roll Khatian No. 22.<br/> <br/>3. The plaintiff's case is that the holding belonged to Agardi Sonaru who died leav­ing defendant No. 3 as heir. She made a gift of the holding to her only issue, the plain­tiff in whose name it was recorded in the preliminary rent roll. On the basis of the gift the plaintiff has been possessing the suit land as his own for more than 40 years. Defendant No. 1 who has been living on the suit land as his licenesee by erecting a hut filed an objection case in 1958 against the plaintiff. The notice of the objection case was never served upon the plaintiff. On the strength of the objection case   defendant No. 1 suc­ceeded in getting the suit land recorded in his name in a separate rent roll. He also filed a case under section 145 of the Code of Civil Procedure against the plaintiff. But in that case possession of the plaintiff was found.<br/> <br/>4. The plaintiff paid rent of the holding to the Government from 1363 to 1369 B.S. In Chaitra, 1370 B.S. the Tahsildar refused to accept rent from him on the ground that the suit land was recorded in the name of defen­dant No. 1. The plaintiff came to know of the fraudulent recording then and, therefore, filed the aforesaid suit.<br/> <br/>5. The suit was contested by defendant No. 1. His case was that the suit land was sold in auction and the landlord parched it and also took delivery of possession. There after the landlord possessed the land in khas through the defendant as bargadar who subsequently took settlement of the said land from the landlord in 1355 B.S. Since then he has been in possession. The rent roll khatian No. 23 has been correctly prepared. <br/> <br/>6. The trial court found title and possession in favour of the plaintiff and decreed the suit with costs against defendant No. 1. On appeal, the learned Subordinate Judge set aside the judgment and decree of the trial court and allowed the appeal. The plaintiff preferred the Second Appeal in the High Court at Dacca and the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division allowed the appeal and restored the trial court's judgment and decree. The defendant No. 1 moved this Court and obtained leave to consider whether the provisions of the Bengal Tenancy Act, particularly those contained in section 26C which bars all kinds of transfer of agricultural land except in certain cases excluded therein without a registered instrument which does not contain an oral gift by a Muhammedan, would apply in the present case so as to nullify the validity of the oral gift which is the basis of the plaintiff's title. Further, if the oral gift in favour of the plaintiff on which he relies is hit by section 26C of the Bengal Tenancy Act whether operation of section 129 of the Transfer of Property Act would be excluded.<br/> <br/>7. Mr. K. A. Bakr, Counsel for the defendant appellant submitted that since the suit land is agricultural land the provisions of the Bengal Tenancy Act would apply in case of transfer of the land, section 26C which was inserted by way of amendment in 1928 being prior to the transfer of the suit land in favour of the plaintiff will govern the transfer. No exception to its applicability can be taken by mentioning that the transfer concerned being by an oral gift is not covered by the world ‘transfer'. The expressions used in Section 26C include every transfer excepting a bequest or a sale in execution of a decree or of a certificate signed under the Bengal Public Demands      Recovery Act, 1913. An oral gift comes within the ambit and scope of every transfer" mentioned in the section. After the enactment of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 provisions relating to the transfer of land of a raiyat which are relevant for our purpose are contained in sections 88 and 89 of the Act. Section 88 provides—<br/> <br/>The holding of a raiyat or a share or portion thereof shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be capable of being transferred by him in the same manner to the same extent as his other immovable property."<br/> <br/>On a comparison between the provisions of Section 26C of the Bengal Tenancy Act and Section 89 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, it would appear that the   words used in both sections are identical. Quite obviously, the interpretation of the former will govern the latter as well unless some distinction can be pointed out.<br/> <br/>8. In considering and supporting the applicability of section 26C to an oral gift of agricultural land made by a Muslim, pronouncements of a few Indian High Courts were referred to by the learned Counsel. In <strong><em>Srimatijan Vs. Fulja Khatun, AIR 1941 (Cal.) 266</em></strong> the question was raised whether the transfer concerned which was in the nature of an oral gift by a Muslim, was hit by section 26C of the Bengal   Tenancy Act. In observing that section 26C was in wider terms which did not limit its operation by taking away any particular class of transfers outside the scope of its mischief, the Court held. —<br/> <br/>"The words "every transfer" are quite general, and must be held to include a transfer by a Mohammedan, so that the result will be that in the ease of such a transfer, it must not only comply with the rules of Mohammedan law, but also satisfy the requirements embodied in this statutory provision."<br/> <br/>Here, the decision in the case of <strong><em>Nasib Ali Vs. Wajed Ali, AIR 1927 (Cal.) 197</em></strong>    was distinguished on the ground that it rested on the interpretation of the relevant sections of the Transfer of Property Act and of the Regi­stration Act.<br/> <br/>9. The next case cited by the learned Cou­nsel is <strong><em>Mt.</em></strong><strong><em> Bibi</em></strong><strong><em> Maniram Vs. Mohammad Ishaque, AIR 1963 (Pat.) 229.</em></strong> Here, the provi­sions of three Acts, namely, section 129 of the Transfer of Property Act, section 37(2) of the Bengal. Agra and Assam Civil Courts Act, and the Shariat Act of 1937, were considered by the Court in order to examine the validity of an oral gift of non-agricul­tural land by the husband in favour of his wife, both of whom were governed by the Muslim law. After considering same deci­sions which included two case decided by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council reported an <strong><em>ILR 15 (Cal.) 684 </em></strong>and<strong><em> AIR 1927 (PC) 22,</em></strong> the Court observed as follows: —<br/> <br/>"I am of the opinion that the rules of Mohammedan law apply to gifts made by Mohammedans in Bihar on the ground of Justice, equity and good conscience, as laid down in sub-section (2) of sec­tion 37 of the Civil Courts Act, Apart from this, so far as the houses in suit are concerned the Mohammedan law of gift applied by virtue of the Shariat Act of 1937."<br/> <br/>10. Reference was made to two other decisions in support of the contention that an oral gift by a Muslim is subject to the provisions of section 26C of the Bengal Tenancy Act and section 17 of the Registration Act, both of which require a   registered instrument to make the gift of immovable property valid. The first is the case of <strong><em>Antaz Mia vs. Mohammad Mostafa, (1965) 17 DLR 112</em></strong> which held that from a reading of sec­tion 26C it was clear that its provisions were made applicable to the transfer under the Muhammadan Law. Further, though the Bengal Tenancy Act was a Provincial law it received the assent of the Governor General of India, and would, therefore, override the personal laws of Muhammadans. No comparisons was made between the provisions of section 26C and section 129 of the Transfer of Property Act. In the second case, namely, <strong><em>Ismail Sayed vs. Commissioner of Karachi, 1968 SCMR 509</em></strong> the Pakistan Supreme Court, in making a casual observation, said that the suit property being of the value of more than Rs. 100/- no right, title or interest in it could, under section 17 of the Registration Act, be conveyed except by a deed in writing and duly registered. The particular transfer   being an oral gift was, therefore, not given effect to in protecting the donee of the gift against eject­ment under the relevant law. The observation made in this decision that oral transfer by gift by a Muslim above hundred rupees required registration is not a correct interpretation of section 17 of the Registration Act.<br/> <br/>11. None of the decisions, it seems, has considered the point involved, that is whether a gift of agricultural land is valid, from all the different aspect. The completion of an oral gift under Muslim Law takes place as soon as there is a declaration of gift by the donee and delivery of possession of the property under the gift is made to the donee by the donor. Nothing remains to be done to make the gift a valid one enforceable under law. No reasonable answer could be given as to why a gift of this nature should be further required to be effected by a registered instrument. Had an oral gift under Muslim Law remained imperfect unless something in writing was to make it a valid gift the question of registration might have arisen.   This being not so in the case of such a gift, the requirement of a registered instrument would seem to be redundant. On the other hand, if there is no oral gift but by an unregistered instrument a person seeks to make a gift of immovable property, it must be registered. When the performance of one kind of obligations imposed under a law makes certain act complete, a separate kind of obligation cannot be introduced to nullify the same unless expressly provided in another law. There are no degrees of completion. When an act is complete, nothing further is required to make it more complete. If, on the fulfillment or the three conditions mentioned above, an oral gift by a Muslim of immovable property is complete, its completeness cannot be destroyed by the requirement of a registered instrument under section 26C as this has not been expressly applied to such gift.<br/> <br/>12. The conflict that has arisen in the present case is not much between the provisions of tenancy laws regarding transfer of immovable property and the personal law of Muslim on the same in particular regarding gift of immovable property, but so much of it as has been recognised in the Transfer of Property Act.   Section 129 of this Act which recognised the personal laws of Muslim relating to gifts as follows: —<br/> <br/>"Nothing in this Chapter relates to gifts of moveable property made in contemplation of death, or shall be deemed to affect any rule of Muhammedan law.”<br/> <br/>This section is an exception to section 123 of the same Act which requires that a gift of immovable property must be effected by a registered instrument. Such exception has been provided only in case of transfer by way of gifts, not to any other form of transfer and is available only to Muslims, not to any other communities, such as Hindus and Budhists.<br/> <br/>13. Further, the learned Counsel for the appellant laid stress on the distinction between agricultural land and non-agricultural land and the different requirements of   the two laws, regarding transfer of such land by gift. It may, however, be mentioned that there is on indication in section 129 restricting its application only to a particular class of lands, that is, non-agricultural land as section 23 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1943 has provided. Section 117 of the Transfer of Property Act excludes from its operation only agricultural leases but not other dispositions.<br/> <br/>14. So far as the wording of either section 26C of the Bengal Tenancy Act or section 89 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act is concerned, we do not find any reference to section 129 of the Transfer of Property Act which read with other sections of this Act contained, contrary provisions relating to the requirement of registration of an instrument of gift by a Muslim. If the legislature intended to exclude the operation of section 129 of the Transfer of Property Act by the later enactment, it ought to have expressly said so, or could have used some such expressions as “notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force". Such phraseology or expressions are used by the legislature to give an enactment or some of its provisions an overriding quality and operation. One does not even have to look up other laws to find the use of such expressions. In section 90 as also in other sections of the State Acquisition and Tenan­cy Act such expressions have been resorted to so as to impart superiority to its provisions over other laws. There is no clause in section 89 of the Act or section 26C of B.T. Act which is under our consideration so as to exclude the operation of section 122 of the   Transfer of Property Act in case of transfer of agricultural land. In addition, after the enactment of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act very little distinctions maintained between the incidents of agricultural land and non-agricultural land. For solid practical reasons also, no such distinction would seem to be attractive. If law as provided in section 129 has exempted the owner of urban pro­perty, which are generally more valuable than agricultural land, from transferring the same by a registered instrument, why should greater hardship be imposed on the holder of agri­cultural land by the requirement of a regis­tered instrument for transferring his interest therein by way of gift. Judged from different viewpoints, the effectiveness of an oral gift of immovable property when property made has not been curtailed by the language of section 26C of the Bengal Tenancy Act or section 89 of the State    Acquisition and Tenancy Act insofar as it has been preser­ved by section 129 of the Transfer of Pro­perty, Act. An oral gift of the immovable property, whether it is agricultural land, or made according to the Muslim Law would, therefore, be valid.<br/> <br/>In the result, the appeal is dismissed without order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
