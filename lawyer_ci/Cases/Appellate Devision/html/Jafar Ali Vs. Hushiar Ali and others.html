Aftab Hossain, Advocate-on-Record -For the Appellant.<br/>Not represented - The Respondent.<br/> <br/><strong>Civil Appeal No. 28 of 1986 </strong><br/>(From the Judgment and order dated 14.11.84 passed by the High Court Division, Sylhet Bench, in Civil Revision No. 1391 of 1978).<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></div> <div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Latifur Rahman J:</strong>This appeal by special leave by the pre‑emptee is directed against the judgment of the High Court Division, Sylhet, in Civil Revision No. 1391 of 1978 discharging the Rule and upholding the orders of the Courts below arising out of an application under section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong> The pre‑emptors' case, is that they filed Miscellaneous Case No. 120 of 1975 for pre-empting the disputed kabala before its registration. Thereafter, he withdrew the case on 27.1.75 and, after obtaining certified copy of the registered deed on 4.2.75, instituted the present case for pre-emption on 17.2.75. The pre-emptor being a contiguous land holder is entitled to pre-empt the disputed kabala registered on 23.4.75.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> The case of the pre-emptee is that, the case is barred by limitation as the same was not filed within 4 months from the date of knowledge.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> Leave was granted to consider whether the pre‑emption proceeding was barred by limitation by 22 months from the date of knowledge of the registration of the impugned kabala as the pre‑emptor filed a pre‑emption case and withdrew the same.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> The positive case of the pre‑emptor is, that he filed the earlier pre‑emption case before the registration of the kabala and hence withdrew the same. According to the pre-emptor, he came to know about the registration of the kabala on 4.2.75 and, after obtaining the certified copy of the same exhibit 1, filed the present case on 12.2.75. The pre-emptor led evidence with regard to his date of knowledge of the registration of the kabala. The pre-emptee did not adduce any evidence to show that the pre‑emptor was aware of the registration of the kabala prior to alleged date of knowledge. There being no evidence on record by the pre‑emptee challenging the date of knowledge of the pre‑emptor, all the Courts below believed the date of knowledge of the pre-emptor and held that the case was not barred by limitation. This being a finding of fact on assessment of evidence on record, Mr. Mohammad Habib Ahmed, learned Advocate's contention that the application is barred by limitation is untenable in law. Consequently, the appeal is dismissed without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
