The impugned Judgment of the High Court Division is dated 4 July 1985 in Civil Revision No. 84 of 1983.<br/> <br/>2. Appellant-Pre‑emptor is the owner of A No. 2575 of Mouza Alipur. Some portion of Plo Nos. 2574 and 2573 were transferred by their own under a kabala dated 3 June 1976, whereupon appellant filed an application under section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act before the Munsif, Faridpur, claiming pre-emption of both the plots taking the ground that these two plots contiguous to his own land. His claim was resisted by the respondent-transferee taking the ground that only a part of Plot No. 2574 is contiguous to the appellant's land that Plot No. 2573 is not at all contiguous, and as such he is not entitled to pre‑empt both the plots. The trial Court allowed pre‑emption in respect of both the plots finding them to be contiguous to the pre‑emptor's land. This finding was confirmed in appeal by the Subordinate Judge. But in revision, as stated above, a learned Single Judge of the High Court Division reversed the finding in respect of Plot No. 2573 and modified the decision of the courts below and allow pre‑emption only in respect of Plot No. 2574 which he found to be contiguous to the pre‑emptor's land in Plot No. 2575. The pre‑emptor came before us leave to appeal and leave was granted to consider whether both the Plots, 2574 and 2573, being allegedly contiguous to each other and forming compact block, should have been allowed o pre-emption on the ground of "contiguity."<br/> <br/>3. The learned Single Judge did not find Plot No. 2573 to be contiguous to appellant's land, Plot No. 2575, and refused pre‑emption to this extent relying upon an observation of this Court in Ahmed <strong><em>Hossain Ys. Basharat Ali, 32 DLR (AD) 54.</em></strong> In that case lands in several plots comprising five different holdings, but touching each other only marginally and not forming a compact block of land, were sought to be pre‑empted by a person claiming that his land was contiguous to these five lands, which were transferred under a single Kabala. In that case five different lands transferred "were close to each other in a zig zag way" and the pre‑emptor's land was not directly contiguous to any of these lands transferred except one of these lands, namely, a tank. This tank was also separated from the pre‑emptor's land by a public path. The courts below including the High Court Division ignored the public path which belonged to the Government and over which no other person put forward any competing claim for pre‑emption. In these circumstances, the Courts below held the tank to be contiguous to the pre‑emptor's land and allowed pre‑emption of all the lands transferred. But on appeal, this Court took the view that the word "contiguous" was not “neighbouring", but it meant actually "touching" and that the tank being separated by a public path it could not be held to be contiguous to the pre‑emptor's land. This was the main reason for this Court's interference with the finding of the courts below and pre‑emption was refused on the ground that "contiguity" was snapped by the public path. In that connection this Court made a query as to whether these five different lands, which were transferred under a <em>kabala</em> could be held to be contiguous to each other so as to form a single compact block, and found the answer in the negative. Indication was, however, given in that Judgment that had those five plots been closely connected together holding a compact block of land and had there been no public path between the pre‑emptor's land and the compact block including the tank, the principle of "contiguity" might have been applicable.<br/> <br/>4. A similar question came up before this Court in a subsequent case, <strong><em>Hazi Tozammbar Ali vs. Abdus Sattar, 34 DLR (AD) 217</em></strong><em>. </em>Three of the Judges of this Court were common to the decisions in both the cases, one in <strong><em>32 DLR (AD) 54</em></strong> and the other in <strong><em>34 DLR (AD) 217.</em></strong> In the latter, the lands transferred consisted of seven plots, all recorded under a single khatian and the pre‑emptor's land was contiguous to two of those seven plots, but nevertheless, he was held to be owning land “contiguous to the land transferred", because though the pre‑emptor's land was contiguous to two of the seven plots transferred, but all those seven plots were not only contiguous to each other but they together constituted one single block of land; as such the entire block was treated as contiguous to the land of the pre‑emptor. In that connection the policy behind allowing pre‑emption to a contiguous land‑holder was explained and it was observed that one of the purposes for allowing pre‑emption to a Contiguous land‑holder was apparently to help enlarge small uneconomical agricultural holdings by consolidation or amalgamation.<br/> <br/>5. In the instant case, the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division relied only upon the previous case, reported in <strong><em>32 DLR (AD) 54.</em></strong> The later one in <strong><em>34 DLR (AD) 217</em></strong> was not probably placed before him. Facts of the two cases are quite distinguishable. In the previous case there was no contiguity at all between the land of the pre‑emptor and the land transferred; secondly, the several lands transferred lay here and there and did not constitute a single block to be treated as one land. Now, if the principle laid down in the <strong><em>34 DLR case</em></strong> is applicable to the present case, pre‑emption as a whole, that is, in respect of both the plots transferred, should be allowed. But on close examination we find that this principle is not applicable here.<br/> <br/>6. Admittedly, the appellant's land, Plot No. 2575, is contiguous to Plot No. 2574, but it is not contiguous to Plot No. 2573. However, if both these plots are closely contiguous to each other and form a compact block of land, then only this principle may be applied. Evidence recorded in the case, however, does not appear to support the claim as to contiguity forming one compact block. But the all important question is whether both these two plots were transferred as a whole under the kabala dated 3 July 1976? The answer is clearly in the negative. Only some parts of these two plots were transferred. The areas thus transferred measure only 20 decimals out of 70 decimals of land, which is the total area of both the plots, 2574 and 2573. The learned Single Judge of the High Court Division allowed pre‑emption of this portion transferred measuring 20 decimals, that is, 2/7, from Plot No. 2574. Whereas this area lies in both the plots. This modification as to the area pre‑empted. we find, has been made in a rough and ready manner. For, admittedly this 20 decimals of land was transferred from both Plot Nos. 2574 and 2573. A pre‑emptor is entitled to pre‑empt only the area of land actually transferred. Therefore the appellant's claim to pre‑emption cannot exceed 20 decimal, which he has been already allowed from one plot. As to the other plot, neither is there any evidence what area was transferred from each of the two plots, nor is there any evidence whether the two areas transferred from these two plots themselves remain contiguous after the transfer. Any way, the transferee has not raised any objection to the pre‑emption of 20 decimal from only one plot‑No. 2574. In the circumstances, pre‑emption as a whole, that is of both the plots, we find, has been rightly refused.<br/> <br/>The appeal is dismissed with costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
