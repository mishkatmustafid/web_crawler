The respondent Nos. 1-9 as plaintiffs filed the suit for confirmation of posses­sion upon declaration of title over 1.91 acres of land and for recovery of<em> khas</em> pos­session after eviction and also for perma­nent injunction restraining the defendants from entering into the schedule land and not to disturb the plaintiffs' title and pos­session and for further declaration that the Deed Nos. 746, 743, 742, 740 and 739 dated 01.01.1979, 03.01.1979 and 04.01.1979 executed and registered in favour of the defendants and Deed No. 11152 dated 13.09.1978 and Deed No.11337 dated 18.09.1978 are forged, null, void, collusive and not binding upon the plaintiffs.<br/> <br/>3. The plaintiffs' case is that their prede­cessor Younus Miah purchased 1.43 acres out of the suit land from the legal heirs of Kabir Ahmed, the predecessor of the defendant Nos.21-24, vide registered deed No.16787 dated 13.11.1979 and said defendant promised to sell the remaining 0.48 acres to the plaintiffs' predecessor and that Kabir Ahmed died on 10.01.1970 leaving behind the defendant Nos.21-24 as his legal heirs to inherit his properties including the suit land and that the defen­dant in particular defendant Nos.6 and 7 on 16.09.1994 threatened the plaintiffs to forcibly take possession of the suit land claiming ownership thereon through sale deed dated 01.01.1979, 03.01.1979,04.01.1979, 18.09.1978 and 13.09.1978 allegedly executed and registered by Kabir Ahmed.<br/> <br/>4. The defendant Nos.6-7 contested the suit by filing joint written statement deny­ing the alleged claim of the plaintiffs and contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the Kabir Ahmed owned the suit land through auc­tion purchase and that by registered <em>kabala</em> No.11152 dated 13.09.1978 he transferred the suit land in favour of Md. Younus Mia who in turn transferred the suit land to Mosst. Mahmuda Khatun and others by registered sale deed No. 11337 executed on 18.09.1978 and registered on 19.09.1978 and that the said purchasers Mosst. Mahmuda Khatun and others in turn sold the suit land by registered sale deed dated 13.01.1979 to the defendant No.1, which prior to purchase published legal notice in the daily newspaper on 01.01.1978 about the purchase of the suit land and did not receive any objection there-against and that after purchase the defendant got its name recorded in the B.S. record and paying rent regularly in its name and that in an appeal filed under Section 31 of the State Acquisition Act by the plaintiffs predecessor the possession of the defendant's was found and con­firmed through an enquiry held on 19.02.1985, resulting dismissal of the appeal and that the defendant lost the orig­inal sale deed from the chamber of the lawyer.<br/> <br/>5. The learned Subordinate Judge decided the case reframing the issues as under:<br/> <br/>১। বর্তমান আকার ও প্রকারে মামলা চলিতে পারে কি?<br/>২। অত্র মামলার উচিৎ মূল্যায়ন করা হইয়াছে কি?<br/>৩। বাদীর মামলা তামাদিতে বারিত কি না?<br/>৪। মামলাটি পক্ষ দুষ্টতায় দুষ্ট কি না?<br/>৫। নালিশী সম্পত্তিতে বাদী পরে স্বত্ব স্বামীত্ব আছে কিনা?<br/>৬। নালিশী সম্পত্তিতে বাদী পক্ষে বিষয়কুল দখল আছে কিনা?<br/>৭। দলিল নং ৭৪৬,৭৪৩,৭৪২,৭৪০,৭৩৯ তারিখ ৪/১/১৯৭৯, ১/১/১৯৭৯, ৩/১/১৯৭৯ এবং দলিল নং ১১৩৩৭ তারিখ ১৮/১/১৯৭৮ ও দলিল নং ১১১৫২ তারিখ ১৯/৯/১৯৭৮ জাল ফেরবি ও যোগসাজসী সাবাস্তে রদ ও রহিত যোগ্য কিনা যে গুলি বাদীগনের উপর বায়া নহে কিনা?<br/>৮। বাদীপক্ষ প্রার্থিত মতে ডিক্রী পাইতে হকদার কিনা?<br/>৯। আইন ও ন্যায়মতে আর কি কি (যদি থাকে) প্রতিকার বাদীপক্ষ পাইতে পারে?<br/> <br/>6. Both the plaintiffs and the defendants adduced 4 witnesses each and the docu­ments produced by the plaintiffs were marked exhibit 1-7 series and those of the defendants were marked exhibit 'K ' to 'Q' series.<br/> <br/>7. On consideration of the materials and evidence on record and the submissions of the learned Advocates of the contesting parties the learned Court observed that Kabir Ahmed was the admitted owner of the suit land and the plaintiffs claimed that since Kabir Ahmed died on 10.01.1970 the registered sale deeds of the defendants dated 13.09.1978 in favour of the defen­dant's predecessor-in-interest Younus Miah and registered sale deed dated 19.09.1978 executed and registered by Younus Miah in favour of Mosst. Mahmuda Khatun and others are forged and fabricated documents and have been made through impersonating the deceased Kabir Ahmed through fictitious person and consequently Younus Mia could not acquire any right, title and interest in the suit land and hence the alleged deed exe­cuted on 18.09.1978 and registered on 19.09.1978 by said Younus Mia has no validity in the eye of law and thus the defendants alleged claim of ownership on the basis of purchase from Mosst. Mahmuda Khatun and others has no legal basis and that the plaintiffs having pur­chased from the legal heirs of Kabir Ahmed with the delivery of possession of the suit land their title and possession are to be confirmed,<br/> <br/>8. It appears from the depositions of P.Ws.1,2 and 3 that they have corroborat­ed the death of Kabir Ahmed on 10.01.1970 and in the cross examination they could not be shaken and further the statement of P.W.3, while deposing in Court that Kabir Ahmed died on 10.01.1970, has not been challenged by the defendants while cross examining said P.W.3 and that the plaintiffs produced the supporting documents to prove their title as well as the P.Ws.2 and 3, being attest­ing witnesses to the registered sale deed, deposed in the Court proving the execu­tion and registration of the said sale deed. It further appears that the D.Ws.3 and 4, the witnesses supporting the claim of the defendants' purchase of and possession in the suit land, are the employees of defen­dants. The plaintiffs also produced the supporting documents relating to death of Kabir Ahmed marked as exhibit 1 series. The defendants in view of their alleged loss of the original sale deed produced the relevant register from the office of the Sub-Registrar to prove the certified copy of the sale deed relating to suit land and thereby to prove the existence of the sale deed but the defendants did not produce any evidence to prove that the Kabir Ahmed was alive on the date of execution and registration of the sale deed in favour of Younus Miah to contradict the specific assertion of the plaintiffs that Kabir Ahmed died on 10.01.1970.<br/> <br/>9. Being aggrieved there-against the plain­tiffs filed appeal in the High Court Division and the High Court Division on consideration of the facts and circum­stances of the case, evidence and materials on record allowed the appeal in part decreeing the suit, amongst others, declar­ing title of the plaintiffs on 1.43 acres of land observing, amongst others, that: "Admittedly the defendants' deeds were executed during 13th September, 1978, 18th September 1978 and 13th January 1979, within a space of 4 months, within which period they brought into existence of seven deeds. The execution of succes­sive deeds showing transfers of the suit lands from one person to another and in the absence of examining any of those vendors and attesting witnesses, on the face of the plaintiffs challenge about their identities, raises a genuine doubt that the defendants have created these fraudulent deeds by setting up some fictitious per­sons. The learned Subordinate Judge has not at all considered this aspect of the mat­ter and over looking this vital aspect believed the defendants deeds as genuine ones.<br/> <br/>10. These deeds are collusive and ficti­tious will also be apparent from the fact that the defendants have not produced the original deeds; they have filed the certi­fied copies of the deeds. In paragraphs 5(<em>Kha)</em> and 5<em>(Ga</em>) of the plaint the plain­tiffs made positive averments that they failed to trace out the whereabouts of these persons and thus they were fictitious persons. The defendants in their written statement simply claimed that these per­sons transferred the land to the defendants and that they handed over the deeds to their learned Advocate for filing an appeal against the record of right and thereafter, the learned Advocate lost those deeds from his chamber. In course of his evi­dence D.W.1 stated that the original deeds were destroyed in the Sub-Registrar's office as they could not procure the same in time and again he said that the docu­ments were lost in 1985. He made two dif­ferent versions in Court. On a query about the date of missing, he failed to mention the correct date. He, however, admitted that about the missing of the deeds, he did not make any G.D. entry with the local police station. As regards destroying the deeds, Shankor Kumar Dey (D.W.2) stat­ed in cross that there was no remark about the destruction of the deeds in respect of the certified copies issued on 27th September 1994 relating to the deeds nos.739 to 744. Therefore, as regards the missing of the original deeds, in view of the two inconsistent versions; initially they stated that those deeds were lost from chamber of the learned Advocate in 1985, but in course of evidence D.W.1 said that the documents were destroyed in the Sub-Registrar's office; it is apparent that these deeds were created in the name of ficti­tious persons after the death of Kabir Ahmed.<br/> <br/>11. The defendants did not examine any attesting witnesses of their deeds. In this regard D.W.1 stated in cross that he was acquainted with Moqbul Ahmed and oth­ers in 1978, when they came to transfer the suit lands. He further said that he did not personally enquire about Kabir Ahmed, Younus Mia and others and that he had no personal knowledge about the registration of the deeds in 1978. These deeds were executed on cartridge papers and not on stamp papers as admitted by D.W.1. He further stated that he did not enquire about the witnesses of the deed dated 13th September 1978. This admis­sion of this vital witness that despite the challenge about the identities he was unmoved to ascertain the identities of their vendors and the witnesses of the deeds land us to believe that the defendants have created these deeds collusively and there­after, they have destroyed them in order to void criminal prosecution and by producing the certified copies they are claiming tie in the suit lands." and that:<br/> <br/>"Learned Advocate appearing for the defendants-respondents argues that since the defendants have not exam­ined the attesting witnesses of their deeds and in the absence of original deeds, they may be afforded an oppor­tunity to examine them and according­ly, the suit may be remanded to the trial Court for fresh hearing for ends of justice. Learned Advocate further submits that the defendant No.6 has already allotted lands to different allottees and if the suit is decreed, there would arise various complica­tions and in that view of the matter, the defendants may also be afforded an opportunity to examine those allotees as well. A remand may not be allowed as a matter of course. A remand may be allowed if the suit is disposed of on a preliminary point or that if the appellate Court thinks it proper it may direct the suit to be remanded to decide on what issues the suit would be tried but this power should be used sparingly. On assess­ment of the evidence on record we find that the parties have adduced their evidence in support of their claim and the Court below has decided the suit on all the issues on merit. We find that it is not a fit case for remand for, if after a full fledged trial of the suit, the suit is remanded again to the trial Court, the ends of justice will be defeated. In that view of the matter, we find no ground to send the suit on remand for fresh decision for enabling the parties to fill up the lacuna. On consideration of the evidence on record, we are satisfied that the plaintiff’s evidence are more stronger and convincing than those of the defen­dants. As regards the title, as observed above, the plaintiffs have been able to prove their title by purchase from the admitted heirs of Kabir Ahmed and they have been able to prove their possession as well. The plaintiffs have purchased 1.43 acres of land from the heirs of Kabir Ahmed, but they seek declaration of title in respect of title 1.91 acres of land. In the plaint they claimed that after execution of the deed by exhibit-8, the heirs of Kabir Ahmed agreed to transfer the remain­ing lands of .48 acres, but they did not claim that the heirs of Kabir Ahmed transferred the said lands. The plain­tiffs also failed to adduce and docu­mentary evidence in respect of their title of .48 acres of land. In view of the above, the plaintiffs are not legal­ly entitled to a decree of 1.91 acres of land. Mr. Kamal-Ul-Alam has frankly conceded that the plaintiffs have no legal document of title in respect of .48 acres of land. In that view of the matter, the plaintiffs are entitled to a decree of 1.43 acres of land covered by exhibit-8."<br/> <br/>12. We have perused the leave petition and the impugned judgment and decree passed by the High Court Division as well as those of the trial Court and considered the submissions of the learned Advocate appearing for the leave petitioner. The learned Advocate submitted that the alleged legal heirs, who sold the suit land to the plaintiffs, though available, did not come before the Court to support the pur­chase of the plaintiffs and hence the proof of the plaintiffs' sale deed through the attesting witnesses cannot be taken into consideration and therefore the plaintiffs are not entitled to get the decree as passed by the High Court Division and that the plaintiffs cannot pray for declaration that the title deeds of the defendants are null and void inasmuch as they are not parties to the said deeds and that the execution and registration of the sale deeds of the defendants were of earlier to those of the sale deed of the plaintiffs.<br/> <br/>13. It appears that the plaintiffs have prayed for declaration that the sale deed Nos.746, 743, 742, 740 and 739 of the Mosst. Mahmuda and others as well as the deed Nos. 11152 and 11337 are also not binding on them and that Kabir Ahmed did not execute and register the deed in reference.<br/> <br/>14. Considering the facts and circum­stances of the case as discussed herein-above and having regard to the failure on the part of the defendant-leave petitioners to overcome the fact of death of Kabir Ahmed in the year 1970 and the reason­ings given by the High Court Division, quoted hereinabove, we do not find any illegality or infirmity in the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division and thus do not find any substance in the leave petition.<br/> <br/>The petition is accordingly dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
