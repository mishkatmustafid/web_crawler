The short facts of the case are that the plaintiffs instituted Title Suit No. 216 of 1985 in the First Court of Munsif, Sylhet Sadar, Sylhet impleading the respondent No.1 as principal defendant and the other respondents as proforma defendants for a declaration of their right, title and posses­sion jointly with the proforma defendants in the suit land and also for a declaration that the judgment passed in Miscellaneous Case No.132 of 1969 of the same court is collusive, illegal, inoperative and liable to be set aside. The suit was subsequently transferred to the Additional Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Sylhet Sadar and renumbered as Title Suit No.50 of 1997. In the plaint the Suit land was described as District-Sylhet, Thana-Sadar, Mouza-Godnorail, Plot No.1859 S.A. Khatian No.192/13 appertains to Dag Number 116 of Abdul Taluk Number 1102/30 measur­ing about 14 acres equivalent to 1/2 Kedar and meets and bounded by, in the east the public path and thereafter the residence of the plaintiffs, in the West the residence of defendant No.1, in the North the passage of the defendant No.1 and thereafter Samad and others, in the South the kitchen garden (bichrachara) of the plaintiffs and the suit land is the family graveyard of the plaintiffs as well as of the proforma defen­dants.<br/> <br/>3. The defendant No.1, Nazibullah con­tested the suit by filing written statement denying the claims of the plaintiffs stating, inter alia, that the suit land along with other lands belonged to Taluk No.1079 Bakor Mohomad and Niskor benombary (numberless) Taluk Niamat Ali Shah and Liakat Ali Shah and the disputed land was not past of Taluk No.1102/30 Abdul Taluk; that without local investigation the plaintiffs are not entitled to get any relief; that the plaintiffs, the proforma defendants or their predecessor have/had no right title and possession in the suit land, the plain­tiffs and the proforma defendants in collusion with each other instituted the suit, that the Kabala in the name or the wife Abdul Khalid dated 12th Baishakh 1326 B.S. as it mentioned in the plaint do not attract the suit land. Moreover, since the plaintiffs and the proforma defendants had got no right, title and possession over the suit land and the suit is not at all maintain­able in its present form inasmuch as the suit land belonged to Abdul Monaf in his Maliki right under his khas possession and while the said Abdul Manaf owned and possessed the land in Maliki right by exe­cuting a kabaliyat dated 04.04.1948 they took settlement of 3 kadar 3 powa land from the said Abdul Monaf with a rent of TK.16.00 per year and thereafter by tak­ing possession of the suit land has been enjoying and possessing the same by using it as his family graveyard, as well as in some part of the suit land he has been growing bamboos and trees; that his son, one daughter and one nephew were buried in the said graveyard, but the plaintiffs or their predecessor did never possess the suit land; that though he has been possess­ing the suit land in the last settlement sur­vey it was recorded in the name of his landlord Abdul Monaf and as such for cor­rection of record he filed Miscellaneous Case No. 139 of 1969 in the First Court of Munsif, Sylhet Sadar under Section 143 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act which was decreed in his favour and accordingly the record was corrected and the judgment passed in that suit can not be declared as set aside since the plaintiffs were aware of the judgment of the case dated 05.08.1970, moreover, the suit is barred by limitation; that subsequently by two amendment petitions the said Nazibullah amended his written statement twice, by the first amendment the quantum of his alleged settlement with him by Abdul Monaf was increased up to 4 kedar 2 powa, and by the second one the state­ment regarding burial the family members of the plaintiff with his permission in the suit land had been struck off. After hear­ing, the Assistant Judge by his judgment and decree dated 19.10. 1999 dismissed the suit with the finding that the suit though is maintainable but barred by limi­tation with the finding that the suit land belonging to Abdul Taluk as reported by the Advocate Commissioner's report is not reliable, and the defendant has been enjoying and possessing the suit land. On appeal the said judgment was affirmed by the appellate Court by the impugned judg­ment and decree dated 17.07.2000 agree­ing with the findings of the Trial Court.<br/> <br/>4. Mr. Abdul Quayum, learned Counsel, appearing for the petitioners submits that the High Court Division while making the Rule absolute did not reverse all the find­ings and decisions of the Court below; that though the plaintiffs claimed the suit land measuring 0.14 acres as land of 1102/30 Abdul Taluk but the P.W-1 (plaintiff No. 2) who deposed for all the plaintiffs admit­ted in chief examination that " নাহঃ সম্পত্তি এই তিন পোয়া আমাদের পুর্ববর্তী আং করিম এর স্বত্ত দখলীয় ছিল”। and also in cross examination admit­ted that "আমরা আব্দুল তালুকের ২২ মং সম্পত্তি পাব” and the contesting defendant filed the khatian No. 424/5 of Dag No. 1860 (Exhibit-Ga) in the name of plaintiffs for an area of 0.22 acres of Abdul Taluk. All of which clearly proved that the plaintiffs have no right, title and interest over the suit land; that the trial Court while consid­ering the local investigation report specif­ically stated that without finding or plac­ing a fixed point by the commissioner the whole work became unwise and accord­ingly ignored the report as not reliable and also considers the suit Khatian in the name of the defendant as belonging to Baker Mahamud Taluk and Khatian No.424/S (Exhibit-Ga) in the name of the plaintiffs as belonging to Abdul Taluk and asserted that the plaintiffs did not raise any ques­tion regarding the entries in the Khatian and as such, held the suit land as belong­ing to Baker Mahmud Taluk; that in the suit graveyard there is no burials of any relation of the plaintiffs, rather on the other hand, the brother of the defendant No.1 and son, daughter and a nephew of defendant No.1 also buried in the suit graveyard which has not been denied by the plaintiffs by cross examining the said defendant No.1, rather the P.W.1 in his cross examination admitted that neither his parents nor his relations were buried in the suit graveyard; that the defendant No.1 on mutating his name in view of judgment and decree as passed in Miscellaneous Case No.132 of 1969 of the First Court of Sadar, Munsif, Sylhet has been paying rent but on the other hand the plaintiffs are not paying any rent concerning Dag No. 1859 which clearly proves the posses­sion of the defendant No.1; that the suit is bad for defect of party in view of the fact of non impleading the heirs of Abdul Monaf in whose name the record of rights were prepared and subsequently corrected by the defendant No.1 vide judgment and decree dated 05.08.1970 as passed in Miscellaneous Case No.132 of 1969 and in case of setting aside of the said decree as passed in Miscellaneous Case No.1132 of 1969 the record of rights would stand in the name of Abdul Monaf and a decree for declaration of title cannot be given with­out impleading the heirs of Abdul Monaf as defendant; that the judgment and decree in Miscellaneous Case No. 132 of 1969 was passed on 05.08.1970 and the plain­tiffs brought the suit on 19.09.1985 and stated that the plaintiffs came to know about the wrong record of rights in the first part of Srabon 1392 B.S; but, could not prove the date by any witnesses and as such, the present suit was hopelessly barred by limitation; that all the 3 P.W.'s are related with each other and in view of the fact and circumstances of the case in absence of any neutral witnesses the plain­tiffs cannot get the relief; that the plaintiffs suit as framed is not maintainable inas­much as the plaintiff claimed declaration of title for themselves along with pro-forma defendant Nos.2-9 which is not per­missible in law; that there was a suit being Title Suit No.293 of 1965 in which there was local investigation covering the pres­ent suit land and the report dated 05.11.1969 has been filed by the defen­dant No.1 in the present suit and the same was marked as Exhibit-'kha' and in that report the suit land has been held as land of Baker Mahamud Taluk and the land of the defendant No.1.<br/>5. It appears from the record that the admittedly the suit land is graveyard and the contesting defendant admitted that some family members of the plaintiffs were buried in that graveyard. It appears that in the suit the pertinent question is that the suit land relates to which Taluk. It appears from the report of an advocate commissioner that the suit land belonged to Abdul Taluk as is claimed by the plain­tiffs. But the said report not properly con­sidered by the trial Court with the plea that the investigation was not started from any fixed point, but in arriving into his such decision the learned Judge has consider his earlier order of the Court whereby the report was accepted by the order No.41 dated 02.08.1989 passed by the Assistant Judge and admittedly against that order the defendant moved the High Court was unsuccessful. It appears that the trial Court considered the commissioner's report with a negative approach and the appellate Court does not at all bother to see that report. That in respect of the question of limitation, the High Court Division held that previously there was no cause of action for the plaintiffs to file any suit since they were not disturbed by any body and the decision of the Miscellaneous Case No.132 of 1969 was not binding upon them since they were not a party in that case.<br/> <br/>6. It is apparent that the defendant did not take settlement of any land relating to the Taluk named as Abdul Taluk, rather he may have taken settlement of land relates to other Taluk which is adjacent to the bad of Abdul Taluk. Therefore, the claim of the defendant has not been established and the Courts below without proper appreciating of that exhibit illegally decid­ed the fate of the suit. It appears that the so-called record of right in the name of Abdul Monaf and subsequently corrected in the name of the contesting defendant by filing a suit under Section 143A of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act is not at all relevant to the suit land and the plaintiff is not bound by the decree of the suit.<br/> <br/>7. The High Court Division as well found that the defendant No.1 has got no basis of his claim in the suit land, rather, he made the false claim on the basis of an alleged kabuliyat which was not supported by any other document and in support of his such document he could not file any scrap of paper; that after 1951 the so-called kabu­liyat, if any, has got no value in the eye of law. The High Court Division observed that the said alleged settlement was not in respect of the suit land. It appears from the rent receipts exhibit-2 series submitted by the plaintiffs that these rent receipts are evidence of possession of the plaintiffs, moreover the contesting defendant him­self admitted that some members of the plaintiff's family were buried in the grave­yard with his permission though subse­quently he struck off such admission made in the written statement itself. It appears that the right of adverse possession can not stand since the defendant claims that he took settlement of the land from his landlord but on his failure to prove his claim he can not raise the alternative plea.<br/> <br/>8. The High Court Division held that on misreading of evidences and on consideration of the evidences on record the Courts below found that the defendant has been enjoying and possessing the suit land, this sort of finding is nothing but illegal occasional failure of justice. On the contrary, the plaintiffs have been able to prove their right, title and possession over the suit land.<br/> <br/>In view of the above, we find no sub­stance in the submissions of the learned advocate for the petitioner.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
