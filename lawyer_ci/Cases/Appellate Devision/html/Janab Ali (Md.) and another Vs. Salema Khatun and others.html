The pre-emptee is the leave petitioner. The pre-emptor filed the pre-emption case claiming to be co-sharer in the case jote within limitation deposit­ing the deed value together with the compensation amount as per law and that the pre-emptee contested the case by filing written objection asserting, amongst others, that the case is bad for defect of party and that the pre-emptor-petitioner is not a co-sharer in the case jote and that the pre-emptee has developed the case land investing Taka 2000 and that the case land was purchased within the knowledge as well as in presence of the pre-emptor, showing the consideration amount at Taka 12,000 in the sale-deed, whereas, in fact, the pre-emptee paid Taka 16,000 as consideration money as fixed within the knowledge of the pre-emptor.<br/> <br/>3. The trial Court framed as many as 8 issues, namely:<br/> <br/>1. Is the case maintainable in its present form?<br/>2. Is the case filed within limitation?<br/>3. Is the plaintiff a co-sharer in the case jote?<br/>4. Is the case bad for defect of parties?<br/>5. Is the case barred by the principle of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence?<br/>6. Did the pre-emptee pay Taka 16,000 as the consideration money?<br/>7. Did the pre-emptee make investment for the improvement of the case land?<br/>8. Is the pre-emptor entitled to pre-emption as prayed for? <br/> <br/>4. The trial Court on consideration of the materials and evidence on record and the submis­sions of the learned Advocate of the contesting parties and having regard to the statements made in the pleadings of the respective parties found all the issues in favour of the pre-emptor and accordingly, allowed the pre-emption. The pre-emptee, being aggrieved, preferred Miscellaneous Appeal No. 58 of 2001 in the Court of District Judge, Mymensingh, and, on transfer, the appeal was heard and disposed of by the learned Joint District Judge, 3rd Court, Mymensingh, who on consideration of the materials and evidence on record allowed the appeal setting aside the judgment and order passed by the trial Court and thereby rejected the pre-emption holding that the Miscellaneous Case was bad for defect of parties and the pre-emptor failed to prove the claim of co-sharer ship in the case jote, observing that the pre-emptor could not produce any deed in support of his claim of co-sharers hip by purchase in the case jote and that the persons named in the case khatian being RoR Khatian No.50 namely, Suruj Ali, Ahamed Ali and Samed Ali, were not made parties in the miscellaneous case. The pre-emptor being aggrieved, moved the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 4578 of 2002, wherein Rule was issued and the said Rule was made absolute on contest setting aside the judgment and order passed by the appellate Court below. The High Court Division found that the suit was not bad for defect of parties and the pre-emptor is a co-sharer by pur­chase in the case jote observing that on the objection raised by the pre-emptee as to defect of parties the pre-emptor filed an application with interrogatories to require the pre-emptee to name the persons not made parties in the miscellaneous case but the lear­ned Court did not pass any order in the said appli­cation and accordingly, the pre-emptor filed application for addition of parties naming the per­sons who were left out to the best of his knowledge and a copy of the application was served upon the pre-emptee and the pre-emptee did not raise any objection against said application for addition of party and also did not bring to the notice of the Court that apart from the persons sought to be added in the case, there were other persons needed to be added as party in the case to cure the miscellaneous case from being bad for defect of party. The pre-emptor's application for adding party was duly allowed and the pre-emptor took required steps accordingly and thereby the pre-emptee is barred from raising any objection as to defect of party on the principle of waiver, acquiescence and estoppel and that the land under pre-emption as well as land earlier purchased by the pre-emptor were of the same RoR Khatian No.50 (Exhibit-3) and both the purchase deed of the pre-emptor as well as the purchase deed of the pre-emptee relates to Settlement Plot No. 103; the land in the deed of purchase of the pre-emptor has been described as "Hal Plot No.577 and the land under pre-emption is described as mentioned Hal Plot No. 583 but both the aforesaid Hal Plot Nos. 577 and 583 correspond to the Settlement Plot No. 103 and thereby the pre-emptor is a co-sharer in the case jote and on discussion at length the single Bench of the High Court Division has found the pre-emptor as co-sharer in the case jote and that the miscellaneous case was not bad for defect of party and the pre-emptee is barred by the principle of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence from raising any objection as to defect of parties.<br/> <br/>5. The High Court Division also found that the story of development of the case land was not proved. The High Court Division in arriving at its decision considered the decisions in the cases reported in 28 DLR (AD) 5, 20 DLR 80, 33 DLR (AD) 113 as cited by the learned Advocate of the respective parties.<br/> <br/>6. We have perused the leave petition, the judgment passed by the High Court Division in making the Rule absolute and the judgment of the appellate Court below as well as the judgment of the trial Court. We have considered the submissions made by the learned Advocate for the leave-peti­tioner, who, amongst others, submitted that the High Court Division failed to apply its judicial mind in assessing the materials on record and has acted ille­gally in setting aside the judgment without distur­bing the findings of fact arrived at by the appellate Court below on due consideration of the materials and evidence on record and also in reversing the finding of the appellate Court below that the pre-emptor is not a co-sharer in the case jote, since admittedly, the plot numbers were different as mentioned in the respective sale deeds.<br/> <br/>7. On consideration of the material on record and discussions made in the judgment by the High Court Division as well as the decisions considered by the High Court Division as to the issue of defect of party, we are of the view that the High Court Division in detailed discussion has arrived at the correct decision as to the issue of defect of party as well as the co-sharers hip of the pre-emptor in the case jote. It appears that on the objection raised by the pre-emptee as to defect of party the pre-emptor has taken necessary step to cure the defect by filing an application with interrogatories and then filed an application for adding some persons as party in the case with copy to the pre-emptee that the pre-emptee purposely did not raise any objection as to the defect of parties mentioning the names who, according to him, were required to be added, being necessary party, in the case and thus the pre-emptee is barred by the principle of waiver, acquiescence and estoppel from raising objection as to defect of party. It also appears from the discussions made by the High Court Division that prior to the sale of the case land the pre-emptor purchased land from the case jote, which is Settlement Plot No. 103. Thus, we do not find any merit in the application.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
