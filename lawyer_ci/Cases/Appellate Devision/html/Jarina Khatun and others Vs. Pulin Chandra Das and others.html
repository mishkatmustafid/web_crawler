No. 26 of 1972 passed by the High Court Division, Comilla on 4.4.83 remanding the case to the first appellate Court allowing the plaintiffs to amend their plaint and for disposal of the same in accordance with law.<br/> <br/>2. Plaintiff respondents instituted O.C. Suit No. 177 of 1967 in the Additional Court of Subordinate Judge, Noakhali for a declaration that the partition deed executed them and the defendant, Abdul Malek, predecessor of the appellants on 12 March, 1965 and registered on 19 March 1965 was void, fraudulent, illegal and was obtained by misrepresentation. Facts, as stated in the plaint, are: Plaintiff-respondents and Abdul Malek (since deceased) and his father were on friendly relations being residents of neighboring village. In the earlier part of Magh, 1371 B.S. plaintiffs becoming apprehensive of the prevailing tension among the Hindus took shelter in the house of the defendant. Plaintiffs proposed exchange of their proper­ties in Calcutta, India with those of Abdul Malek and accordingly delivered their title deeds and khatians to Abdul Malek and asked him to prepare a power of attorney in his favour. Abdul Malek got the deed prepared which was signed and executed by the defendants on 15 Chaitra 1371 B.S. The deed thus prepared was signed by the defen­dants without their knowing its contents.<br/> <br/>3. Towards the end of 1373 B.S. plaintiffs became suspicious and by obtaining the cer­tified copy of the deed on 22 April 1967 found that the defendants got a partition deed ins­tead of the power of Attorney. The deed thus obtained by practicing fraud upon the plaintiffs cast cloud upon their title and hence the plaintiffs filed the suit on 13 December, 1967 as mentioned above. Defendant, Abdul Malek (predecessor the appellant), contested the suit. Defendant had good relations with the plaintiff since be served in a Rubber factory in Calcutta. At the plaintiff's request he purchased in their benami .25 acres of land of Plot No. 138 appertaining to C. S. Khatian No. 64 of Mouza Jadabpur from one Haragobinda Das. Subsequently by 22 different sale deeds during the period begin­ning from 15 November 1945 to 21 October 1959 defendant purchased several plots in the benami of the plaintiffs. While at Calcutta defendant used to pay the educational ex­penses of the two sons of plaintiff No.1 and plaintiff No. 2. Plaintiffs, however, trans­ferred most of their properties to the defen­dant and delivered possession of the same to him.<br/> <br/>4. In 1964 defendant returned to Bang­ladesh permanently and plaintiffs decided to go to Calcutta for good. Plaintiffs made over their title deeds to the defendant and executed and registered the partition dead in question out of their free will. On the basis of the deed of partition defendant possessed the 'Ka' schedule lands and plain­tiffs possessed 'Kha' schedule lands. All the plaintiffs thereafter left for Calcutta and did not return ever since. Two plaintiffs who wanted to leave the country after making over possession of 'Kha' schedule land to the defendant were prevailed upon by some designing persons to file the suit.<br/> <br/>5. Suit is not maintainable under section 83 of the Code of Civil Procedure and is also barred under section 42 of the Speci­fic Relief Act. Mere declaration without any prayer for consequential relief on payment of <em>ad valorem</em> court fee cannot be enter­tained. The suit was dismissed by the Ad­ditional Court of Subordinate Judge, Noakhali upon holding that the suit was bar­red under Rule 161 of the Defence of Pakistan Rules and section 83 of the Code of Civil Procedure Further, both parties were equally guilty of fraud and the partition deed was thus a product of forgery commi­tted jointly by them.<br/> <br/>6. Plaintiffs preferred Title Appeal No.10 of 1968. Defendant filed a cross-appeal. The appeal and cross-appeal were heard together by the Additional District Judge, Noakhali who allowed the appeal upon hol­ding that the 'suit’ was not barred under section 83 of the Civil Procedure Code, that the partition deed was obtained by fraud and as the plaintiffs were in posses­sion of the suit land no prayer for posses­sion and confirmation thereof was necessary.<br/> <br/>7. Against this judgment defendant pre­ferred Second Appeal No.26 of 1972 in, the High Court Division which affirmed the decision of the first appellate Court as re­gards the fraudulent nature of the partition deed and possession of the plaintiffs but set aside the judgment by holding that the suit must fail without a prayer for cance­llation of the partition deed. Accordingly the suit was remanded to the first appellate Court giving the plaintiffs’ an opportunity to amend the plaint and pay appropriate court fee for the purpose.<br/> <br/>8. Being aggrieved, defendants moved this Court and obtained leave to appeal to consider whether, the proposed amend­ment of the plaint will charge the nature of the suit necessitating payment of <em>ad va­lorem</em> court fees and further evidence thus creating complication with regard to limita­tion as provided by Article 91 of the Limi­tation Act which bars such amendment, and whether such amendment for cancella­tion of the partition deed being barred under the  Limitation Act can be allowed at the appellate stage.<br/> <br/>9. Mr. M. Nurullah Counsel for the defendant, appellants, submitted that in case the amendment is allowed to be made the original suit which was for declaration that the partition deed of 19 March 1965 was frau­dulent, void and illegal, could be converted into a suit for cancellation of the partition deed. Such amendment could also require the payment of <em>ad valorem</em> court fee. Further the relief now claimed by the plain­tiff respondents was not previously sought for by them. In this connection the learned Counsel also referred to the provisions of Order 6 Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure. These provisions are as follows: <br/> <br/>''The Court may at any stage of the proceedings allow either party to alter or amend his pleadings in such manner and on such terms as may be just, and all such amendments shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties." <br/> <br/>10. As against these contentions Mr. Khan, the learned Counsel for the plain­tiff-respondents, contended that the amend­ment of plaint as prayed for by the plaintiffs would not change the nature of the suit since the prayer in the petition for amend­ment follows from the declaration originally prayed for by the plaintiffs in their plaint, allegations remaining the same. The learned Counsel submitted that in view of the find­ings arrived at by the first appellate Court and affirmed by the learned Judges of the High Court Division, there would be no need to record further evidence in the suit. He also submitted that the requirement as to payment of <em>ad valorem </em>Court fees on the amendment of the plaint had nothing to do with the determination of the question as to whether he nature of the suit would be changed due to such amendment as prayed for by the plaintiffs. Finally, in the Counsel's opinion, the relief now claimed by way of amendment of the plaint can be granted on payment of necessary additional Court fees even with­out praying for such amendment, since the Court itself can, in order to give effect to the declaration prayed for in the suit, order the cancellation of the document.  In support of these contentions, Mr. Khan, Counsel for the plaintiff-respondents, cited three deci­sions reported in <strong><em>(1965) 17 DLR 190, (1977) 29 DLR 311 SC and 1979 BSCR 135.</em></strong><br/> <br/>11. In <strong><em>Golam Hafez Mia Vs. Khadem Ali Meah (1977) 29 DLR 311 SC,</em></strong> this Court relying upon the case of <strong><em>Keramat Ali Vs. Muhammad Yunis, 15 DLR 120 SC</em></strong> held that the amendment of pleading may be allowed at any stage of the suit provided such amen­dment did not prejudice the interest of the other party nor it would change the nature of the suit. The Court observed as follows: <br/> <br/>"It is the consistent view of judicial authorities, those amendments of the pleadings is allowed, even when a legal right had accrued to the other party, if special, circumstances of the case outweigh such consideration. In exerci­sing this power, the Court would no doubt, be reluctant to allow such an amendment, which would have the effect of totally altering nature of the suit, or take away a valuable right accrued by lapse of time, but wherein the circumstances of the particular case, it would be plainly inequitable to refuse such a relief, the court will not hesitate to act." <br/> <br/>12. Subsequently, in the case of <strong><em>Nurun Nahar vs. Mohd. Fazlur Rahman (1979) BSCR 135</em></strong>, this Court reiterated the same principles. Further, referring to the provisions for amendment of the plaint as provided in rule 17 Order 6 of the Code of Civil Procedure which says that the Court can at any stage of the suit allow the amendment of the pleadings, if it thinks just for determining the real que­stion in controversy between the parties. The Court observed that "the wording of the Code is wide, and it has been liberally in­terpreted by all the Courts of the Sub-Continent and the Privy Council. Unlike the provisions of addition of parties, the Code has not set up any bar of limitation in allowing amendment of the pleadings. None­theless, it is now well settled that the ques­tion of delay is always considered as an important consideration in allowing or refusing amendment of the pleadings".<br/> <br/>13. As to the question of limitation in case of amendment of the pleadings the Court observed that ''there are two ways in which the same may arise. First, whether the claim to be included was barred on the date of the institution of the suit. Secondly, whether the claim is barred on the date of the prayer for amendment. On the first, the prayer for amendment cannot be allowed as it was barred on the date of the suit on the second, however, the prayer could be allowed subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions"<br/> <br/>14. It appears that the plaintiff-respon­dents in the petition for amendment prayed for cancellation of the partition deed as being "দলিল ভুয়া, তঞ্চকতামুলক, কার্যকরী, োবআইনী ও void সাব্যস্তে তাহা cancellation ঘোষনার মোকদ্দমা।” In places of original pra­yer for declaration of the partition deed as null and void and fraudulent, the substitu­tion of the prayer made originally in the plaint as above-mentioned by the prayer made in the petition for amendment does not in our opinion, lead to any appreciable change in the character of the suit. Cause of action arose on 22 April 1967 and the suit was filed on 13 December, 1967. Since the relief prayed for in the amendment petition ap­pears to follow from the declaration prayed for in the plaint the contention that there was no question of limitation does not appear to be unacceptable. If the Court, after taking evidence, comes to hold that certain docu­ment is null and void being fraudulent, there is no reason why it cannot order its cancellation after granting the said declara­tion. Cancellation of a document seems to be a consequence of the declaration of the deed as null and void. Justice also requires that when a document is declared to be null and void having been proved to be a frau­dulent one, such a consequential relief should also be granted at the same time.<br/> <br/>For the reasons stated above, the appeal is dismissed without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
