The trial Court, the learned Subordinate Judge, 1st Court, Dhaka rejected the defendant­- respondents application under Order VII, rule 11 CPC in Title Suit No. 27 of 1985. In revision, Civil Revision No. 407 of 1985, a learned Single Judge of the High Court Division set aside that judgment and directed the trial Court to reject the plaint <em>in limini.</em><br/> <br/>3. The plaintiff is the appellant by leave from the judgment and order of the High Court Division dated 12.5.91.<br/> <br/>4. The appellant Jobeda Khatun filed the suit with the averments, <em>inter alia, </em>that she is the owner in possession of the suit property which is a town property. Defendant Nos. 1‑5, of whom defendant Nos. 1 and 2 are dead and are now substituted by their heirs, having no manner of right ' title and possession thereof attempted to take forcible possession of her property. On 18.1.79 she filed a petition before the SDO (South), Dhaka against the defendants for drawing up a proceeding under section 144 Cr.P.C. against defendant No. 1. The SDO (South), Dhaka directed the Officer‑in‑Charge of Gulshan Police Station, defendant No. 6, to maintain <em>status quo </em>and also to enquire and report. The defendants were asked to show cause by 28.2.79 why the proceeding shall not be drawn up against defendant No. 1. Defendant No. 6 found on spot enquiry that the plaintiff and her son were in peaceful possession of the suit property and submitted a report to that effect on 29.1.79 whereupon a proceeding under section 144 Cr.P.C. was drawn up against defendant No. 1.<br/> <br/>5. While the said proceeding was in force the SDO (South), Dhaka drew up a proceeding under section 145 Cr.P.C. on 7.3.79 against the plaintiff and attached the same suit property, appointing defendant No. 6 as receiver of the same in Proceeding Case No. 1506a4 of 1978. The plaintiff came to learn on search that before she filed her own petition defendant No. 1 filed a petition before the SDO (South), Dhaka to draw up a proceeding in respect oil the same property under section 144 Cr.P.C. against her and her son. The Officer‑in‑Charge, Motijheel PS was directed to enquire and report, but as the suit property was outside his jurisdiction the matter was put up again on 20.1.79 before the SDO (South), Dhaka who directed defendant No. 6 to enquire and report. The latter without visiting the suit property submitted a report stating that he visited the suit property on 10.2.79 and found that the plaintiff had dispossessed defendant No. 1 and his son from the suit property on 20.1.79, which is contradictory to his own report dated 29.1.79. Thereafter on 7.3.79 the SDO (South), Dhaka drew up the Proceeding Case No. 1506a of 1978 against the plaintiff under section 145 Cr.P.C.. The plaintiff filed Criminal Revision No. 91 of 1979 on which the learned Additional Sessions Judge, 1st Court, Dhaka made Criminal Reference No. 253 of 1979 to the High Court Division recommending the setting aside of the Order dated 7.3.79, but as the learned Advocate for the plaintiff could not attend the High Court Division on the date of hearing the Reference was heard <em>ex parte </em>and it was rejected on 30.1.80. The plaintiff apprehending that on receipt of the records of the Proceeding Case from the High Court Division, the Magistrate may direct defendant No. 6 as receiver of the suit property to take actual physical possession of the suit property from the plaintiff filed the instant suit for permanent injunction on 8.2.80 against defendant Nos. 1‑5 to restrain them from entering upon or interfering with or dispossessing the plaintiff from the suit property or any part thereof.<br/> <br/>6. To make the long subsequent story short, it may be stated that the plaintiff also filed an application for temporary injunction upon filing of the suit on 8.2.80. The trial Court granted an order of ad‑interim injunction against which the respondents preferred Miscellaneous Appeal No. 119 of 1980 which was dismissed by the learned Additional District Judge, Dhaka on 31.5.80 .The respondents then filed Civil Revision No. 881 of 1980 which was disposed of on 8.7.81 by the High Court Division with an order to maintain <em>status quo</em> for 2 months within which the trial Court was directed to dispose of the application for temporary injunction.<br/> <br/>7. On 15.7.80 the SDO (South), Dhaka received the case records of Proceeding Case No. 1506 a 4 /78 from the High Court Division and directed both the parties to submit written statement in support of their respective claims. Defendant Nos. 1-5, who were first party in the proceeding, submitted their written statement on 28.10.80. On 1.12.80 after hearing both sides the SDO (South), Dhaka passed an order of stay of the Proceeding Case fill disposal of the instant Title Suit to "avoid any clash with the order of the Civil Court", having been informed of the order of <em>ad interim</em> injunction passed by the trial Court in the Title Suit on 8.2.80.<br/> <br/>8. In the Title Suit itself the defendant -respondents filed their written statement on 9.4.81 and on 4.9.81 the order of ad‑interim injunction was made absolute by the trial Court against which the respondents did not move any higher forum. Three years thereafter, on 7.7.84, when the Title Suit was ready for peremptory hearing, the respondents filed an application for the first time under Order VII, rule 11 CPC for rejection of the plaint.<br/> <br/>9. The trial Court held that the plea of lack of cause of action, taken by the respondents, cannot be decided without taking evidence and as to whether the suit is barred by law, it said, "Admittedly the plaintiff has possession in the suit land and he claims that he has right, title and interest in the suit land. It is the civil Court who can decide the right, fide, interest and possession in respect of any property in dispute. The Sub‑Divisional Officer may attach any land and appoint a receiver to manage such property temporarily. But he cannot pass any opinion regarding the fide and ownership in respect of any property. When the matter has come to the civil Court for deciding the title and ownership of suit property I think it is the proper forum to make decision in this respect. Hence I am of the opinion that the suit is not barred by any law".<br/> <br/>10. The High Court Division noticed the statement in the plaint that if injunction is not granted then the Proceeding Case No. 1506a4 of 1978 will be given effect to, or in other words, the suit has been instituted to frustrate the said Proceeding Case. Since the Civil Suit was riled after the proceeding under section 145 Cr.P.C. was drawn up and since the purpose of the suit was to defeat the said criminal proceeding, the High Court Division was of the opinion that the present suit is barred by the provisions of section 56(e) of the Specific Relief Act.<br/> <br/>11. Leave was granted to consider the submission of the appellant that the High Court Division harboured a misconception of the scopes of section 145 Cr.P.C. and of a suit for permanent injunction, whether instituted earlier or later to the proceeding under section 145 and also to consider the further submission that the High Court Division put a wrong construction on the plaint and had erroneously appreciated the relevant provisions of Order VII, rule 11 CPC and section 56 of the Specific Relief Act.<br/> <br/>12. Mr. Khandker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, learned Advocate for the appellant, submits only two points, namely, that when the parties are in contest and the issues have already been settled then only the issues may be tried, maintainability being one of them, but at this stage of the suit the plaint cannot be rejected under Order VII, rule 11 CPC. Secondly, the right of a litigant to come to civil Court to have his right and title decided, even though incidentally, cannot be taken away. No decision has been cited by him.<br/> <br/>13. Mr. Md. Nurul Huq, learned Advocate for the respondents, submits, on the other hand, first, that a plaint can be rejected at any stage of the proceeding and, secondly, from the very averments; in paragraph 16 of the plaint the cause of action emanates from the proceeding under section 145 Cr.P.C. and therefore the very object of the suit is to stay the proceeding in a criminal matter which is barred under section 56(e) of the Specific Relief Act. He has cited AIR 1924 (Nag) 80 in support of his first submission but cited no decision in support of the second.<br/> <br/>14. With regard to the first submission of the appellant, it may be stated that there is no hard and fast rule as to when and at what stage a plaint can be rejected. It all depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case. As a general rule an application to reject a plaint ought to be filed at the earliest possible opportunity, so as not to fritter away time, energy and money on a fruitless litigation. If a defendant prefers to file such an application after the issues are framed and considerable time has rolled by since the filing of the suit, he is likely to get his application looked at with askance by the Court which will find it harder and harder to intervene on his behalf as litigation progresses‑ But if his case for rejection of the plaint turns out to be a compelling one, the Court may be persuaded to overlook the delay.<br/> <br/>15. With regard to the second submission it is argued by Mr. Md. Nurul Huq, and quite rightly, that the appellant's cause of action for filing the suit did not arise from die respondents' alleged attempt to take forcible possession of the suit property prior to 18.1.79 when she filed a petition before the SDO (South), Dhaka for drawing up a proceeding under section 144 Cr.P.C. against deceased defendant No. 1. It arose, according to her, for the first time on 7.3.79 when the order of attachment and appointment of receiver was made. Whether this open invocation of the order of attachment and appointment of receiver as the cause of action of the suit is an acknowledgment of an attempt to stay proceeding in a "criminal matter" is the question.<br/> <br/>16. The law as to whether a civil suit will prevail over a proceeding under section 145 Cr.P.C. is fairly well‑settled when a civil suit is filed before a proceeding under section 145 Cr.P.C. is drawn up. If a civil Court is already seized with the subject matter of dispute and has also passed an order regulating possession thereof or in a case in which a decree for possession has been granted or a decree for permanent injunction has been granted, the jurisdiction of a Magistrate under section 145 Cr.P.C. is ousted, the only saving being that action can be taken under sections 107 and 151 Cr.P.C. to prevent breach of peace, but no order by a Criminal Court for attachment of the property under section 145 Cr.P.C. can validly be made. This principle was laid down in the case of <strong><em>Shah Muhammad Vs. Huq Nawaz and the State, 23 DLR (SC) 14</em></strong> and has since been followed by this Court in the case of <strong><em>Md.</em></strong><strong><em> Shahabul Huda Vs. Md. Shafi, 36 DLR (AD) 44.</em></strong><br/> <br/>17. But this is a converse case. A proceeding under section 145 Cr.P.C. was drawn up as early as 7.3.79 and the appellant challenged the order unsuccessfully upto the High Court Division. She filed the suit on 8.2.90, i.e. after 11 months. TN suit property was attached and a receiver b appointed on 7.3.79 but the order was still not give effect to when the appellant filed the suit.<br/> <br/>18. The Specific Relief Act, 1877 was enacted following the English practice governing the field In England a Court of Equity had no jurisdiction to interfere for the prevention of crime, or to enforce moral obligation, nor did it interfere for the prevention of illegal acts, merely because they are illegal. A Court of Equity exercised jurisdiction when there was an actual or prospective injury to property. Its interference was founded solely on the ground of injury to property. (See Kerr on Injunctions, P 8 and Spelling on Injunction, Article 24).<br/> <br/>19. This principle is embodied in section 56 (e) of the Specific Relief Act which provides that “an injunction cannot be granted to stay proceedings in any criminal matter.".<br/> <br/>20. In undivided India it was therefore held, following the English precedents, that a Civil Court cannot stay a criminal prosecution by preventing the proceedings from continuing by an injunction to the complainant <em>(In <strong>Re NP Essappa Chettiar, AIR 1942 (Mad) 756). </strong></em>Similar decisions were given by the Calcutta High Court in the cases of <strong><em>The Corporation  of Calcutta Vs. Bijoy Kumar and others, AIR 1924 (Cal) 334, and Commissioners for the Port of Calcutta Vs. Suraj Mull Jalan and others, AIR 1928 (Cal) 464.</em></strong> It is settled, these decisions go, that  where the legislature has indicated a mode of procedure before a Magistrate, a civil Court will not E interfere, except in special circumstance, by way of injunction of declaration of right. Those were however cases of criminal prosecutions for breach of rules of corporate bodies and do not relate to preventive sections of Cr.P.C. like sections 144‑147. Criminal prosecutions for breach of statutory rules of corporate bodies and preventive measures taken to maintain peace where disputes as to immovable property are involved do not stand on the same footing. But even when criminal prosecution is involved, a suit is not completely barred. In <strong><em>AIR 1942 (Mad) 716</em></strong><em>, </em>various decisions from English Courts were cited and it was held as follows:<br/> <br/>"The principle deducible from these decisions is that although the extreme position cannot be maintained that there is absolutely no jurisdiction in the Court to restrain proceedings before a Magistrate, the Court will not interfere, unless in very special circumstances by way of injunction or declaration of right, where the Legislature has pointed out a mode of procedure before a Magistrate."<br/> <br/>21. As to proceedings under section 145 Cr.P.C. it is erroneous to designate the complainant as an informant, having regard to the provisions of that section. Once an information is brought to the notice of the Magistrate he has to be satisfied that a dispute as to immovable property is likely to cause a breach of the peace. Further proceedings which he starts are not proceedings in the interest of any private party but in the interest of public peace. <strong><em>(See Babu Vs. Shyam, ILR 1950 All 543</em></strong><em>). </em>It is, therefore, highly doubtful if a proceeding under section 145 Cr.P.C. can properly be termed as a "criminal matter" within the meaning of section 56 (e) of the Specific Relief Act.<br/> <br/>22. The legal effect of an order passed under section 145 Cr.P.C. was considered by the Privy Council in <strong><em>Dinomoni Chowdhrani Vs. Brojo Mohini Chowdhrani (1901) 29 Ind. App. 24(33)</em></strong> as follows :<br/> <br/>“These orders are merely police orders made to prevent breaches of die peace. They decide no question of title.”<br/> <br/>23. The Indian Supreme Court approvingly quoted the aforementioned observations of the Privy Council in <strong><em>Bhinka Vs. Charan Singh, AIR 1959 (SC) 960</em></strong> and upheld the maintainability of six suits for eviction filed by a Zamindar against some persons who claimed to be hereditary tenants and who obtained an order from a Magistrate under section 145(6) Cr.P.C. to the effect that they were entitled to be in possession of the suit property. The Zamindar still being in possession filed the suits. A Special Bench of the Assam High Court followed this decision in a later case under similar circumstances in <strong><em>Brojendra Kumar Sengupla Vs. Jilendra Chandra Sen, AIR 1960 Assam III </em></strong>and upheld an order of temporary injunction passed in ihe suit for declaration of title, confirmation of possession and permanent injunction.<br/> <br/>24. The Calcutta High Court in the case of <strong><em>Begum Vs. Seth Dooli Chand, </em></strong>(1909) 2 IC 266, had uie occasion to observe the nature of orders passed under section 145 Cr.P.C. as follows :<br/> <br/>“One further argument was advanced by the leaned pleader for the appellant that a civil Court has no right to issue an injunction which would have the effect of staying proceedings in a criminal Court. By this it was meant that the effect of the injunction (a temporary injunction in this case was to quash the proceeding under section 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. We do not think that proceedings under section 145, Code of Criminal Procedure, can be said to be criminal proceeding within the meaning o that principle, nor do we think that a civil Court's action can possibly be fettered by any action which one of the parties to the suit may choose to take before the Magistrate under this provisions of that section. This injunction, moreover, was not granted for the express purpose of staying those proceedings, nor indeed had it that effect, except perhaps indirectly.”<br/> <br/>25. When a proceeding under section 145 Cr.P.C. is not a "criminal matter", then it is difficult to see how the suit will be barred under section 56(c) of the Specific Relief Act. Section 9 CPC is of particular relevance in is respect and it is a follows:<br/> <br/>"9. The Courts shall (subject to the provisions herein contained) have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature excepting suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred.<br/><em>Explanation.- </em>A suit in which the right to property or to an office is contested is a suit of, civil nature, notwithstanding that such right may depend entirely on the decision of questions as to religious rites or ceremonies."<br/> <br/>26. The appellant has filed the instant suit in which her right to property is in contest. It is a suit of a civil nature. The criminal Court in attaching the property and appointing a receiver has only taken a step in preventing a breach of public peace. It would have been a different matter if the receiver had taken actual physical possession of the suit property. The property would then have been in <em>custodia legis </em>and the question of permanent injunction against die respondents would not have arisen. But the appellant filed the suit while still in possession and the civil Court will of necessity adjudicate upon her possessory right, looking incidentally into her title as well. The Criminal Court is concerned neither with the possessory right nor with the title of the parties to the proceeding. Nor is the second party (the plaintiff) answering a Criminal charge before the Criminal Court. It is a law and order problem and the Magistrate's only lookout is to see whether the first party was dispossessed from the immovable property by the second party within two months next before the date of order passed under section 145(1) Cr.P.C. treating the party so dispossessed as if he had been in possession at such date. It is a speedy remedy and the order passed thereon is a temporary order which is overtaken by an order of the Civil Court if it decides to intervene. The wider and more elaborate remedy in the civil Court is not barred thereby.<br/> <br/>27. There is another aspect to this matter. An injunction can be temporary or permanent. Section 53 of the Specific Relief Act makes this distinction clear:<br/> <br/>"Temporary injunctions are such as are to continue until a specified time, or until the further order of the Court. They may be granted at any period of a suit, and are regulated by the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/> <br/>A perpetual injunction can only be granted by the decree made at the hearing and upon the merits of the suit; the defendant is thereby perpetually enjoined from the assertion of a right, or from the commission of an act, which would be contrary to the rights of the plaintiff."<br/> <br/>28. As temporary injunctions are by the express words of section 53 left to be regulated by the Code of Civil Procedure section 56 which occurs in the Chapter relating to perpetual injunction has no application to temporary injunctions and when section 56 provides that "an injunction cannot be granted" it means perpetual injunction and not temporary injunction. A perpetual injunction can only be granted by the decree made at the hearing and upon the merits of the suit. In a suit of this nature, but not invariably in all suits for permanent injunction, it cannot be determined at the inception of the suit or until the conclusion of hearing of the suit on merits as to whether the decree will have the effect of staying a criminal matter, if at all a proceeding under section 145 Cr.P.C. is a criminal matter. The first party (the respondents) may opt out of the proceeding and the Magistrate himself may drop the proceeding before the decree is passed, Therefore there is no compelling ground at this stage of the proceeding of the suit to reject the plaint altogether.<br/> <br/>29. In the present case the Magistrate was not directed by an order of temporary injunction to stay the proceeding under section 145 Cr.P.C.. What the Magistrate did was to stay the proceeding on his own "to avoid any clash with the order of the civil Court". Injunction is a remedy <em>in</em> <em>personam</em> which is directed against the litigant and not against the Court. (See <strong><em>Mahant Ram Keshwar Das Vs. Baldeo Singh, AIR 1938 (Pat) 606</em></strong>). The Magistrate could take the view that the civil Court's order of ad‑interim injunction had no effect upon the proceeding before him and he could have continued the proceeding all the same. As was observed by the Calcutta High Court in the previously cited case in <strong><em>(1909) 2 IC 266</em></strong>. "The injunction, moreover, was not granted for the express purpose of staying these proceedings, nor indeed had it that effect, except perhaps indirectly." The Magistrate, however, did in the present case what propriety required of him. In granting temporary injunctions in cases of this nature the trial Court must take care to see whether the plaintiff has made out an exceptional case for interference, for it is also the duty of the civil Coo not to embarrass a Criminal Court, if it can.<br/> <br/>30. These observations, however, will not affect the order of temporary injunction passed in the present suit.<br/> <br/>31. In a decision of the Indian Supreme Court in the case of <strong><em>Saijan Singh, son of Jahan Nath Singh Vs. Saiian Singh, son of Bharu Singh and another, 1970 UJ (SC) 75</em></strong> (the Law Report being not available, the gist of the decision has been taken from the "Twenty‑one years' Supreme Court Digest 1950-70" by SK Agarwal Volume 2 (1972) at page 662), the facts were that in a proceeding under section 145 Cr.P.C. the Sub-Divisional Magistrate ordered the attachment of the house in question. While the appellant's application to the Sub‑Divisional Magistrate to drop the proceeding was pending, he filed a civil suit for permanent injunction so that his own possession might not be disturbed. A temporary injunction was granted on the following day. He produced the order of temporary injunction and asked for stay of the proceeding under section 145 Cr.P.C. The Sub‑Divisional Magistrate dismissed the application and ordered the <em>Tashildar </em>to take over the house as a receiver. Against the order of the Sub‑Divisional Magistrate a revision was filed in the Court of Sessions. The Sessions Judge made a Reference to the High Court recommending that the appointment of the receiver be set aside. The High Court came to the conclusion that both the order of attachment of the house and the appointment of the receiver were valid and that the civil Court's order of temporary injunction had no effect upon the proceeding before the Sub‑Divisional Magistrate.<br/> <br/>32. The Indian Supreme Court held that this case must go back to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate for decision of the proceeding before him. Those proceedings commenced as far back as 1967 and the question whether there is or there is not any apprehension of breach of peace will certainly have to be decided in the light of the happening in the civil Court. The Indian Supreme Court found no reason to set aside the order of the High Court and observed that it will be open to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate to consider whether the receiver should be continued or not, but in any event he shall not disturb the possession of the appellant so long as the temporary injunction is outstanding and pending the decision of the proceeding under section 145 Cr.P.C. with a view to handing over the possession to the other side.<br/> <br/>33. In the instant case the civil suit is at the peremptory stage of hearing and the proceeding under section 145 Cr.P.C. was stayed by the learned Magistrate as far back as 1980, against which order the respondents took no steps. The respondents have suffered an order of temporary injunction from the Civil Court for the last 11 years without taking the matter to a higher forum. The suit therefore should be tried as early as possible and it will be for the respondents to take such steps as they are advised to prosecute the proceeding under section 145 Cr.P.C.<br/> <br/>The appeal is, therefore, allowed without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
