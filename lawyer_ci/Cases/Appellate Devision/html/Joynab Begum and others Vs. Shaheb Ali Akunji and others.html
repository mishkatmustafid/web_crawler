Tafazzul Islam J:</strong>This appeal, by leave, is directed against the judgment and order dated 9-8-2000 of the High Court Division passed in Civil Revision No. 3175 of 1993 making absolute the Rule obtained against the judgment and decree dated 21-8-1993 of the learned Additional District Judge, Bagerhat passed in Title Appeal No. 207 of 1989 affirming those of dated 28-7-1987 of the learned Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Bagerhat passed in Title Suit No. 94 of 1982 decreeing the suit.<br/> <br/>2. Late Kawsar Ali Shaikh, the predecessor in interest of the appellants, filed the above Title Suit No. 94 of 1982 for specific performance of contract on the averments that late Noor Ali Akunji, the defendant No. 1 in the above suit and the predeces­sors in interest of the respondent Nos. 5 to 12, was the owner in possession of the suit land measuring 3.93 acres and he on 29-11-1976 entered into an agreement with the plaintiff for sale of the suit land at a consideration of Taka 30,000 and on receipt of Taka 25,000 as advance he made over the posses­sion of the suit land to the plaintiff and in the said agreement it was stipulated that the defendant No. 1 shall get back the possession of suit land in case of his refund of the advance amount of Taka 25,000 within the month of Chaitra 1386 BS and in default, the defendant No. 1 shall execute and register sale deed within the month of Baisakh 1387 BS in favour of the plaintiff on receipt of balance amount Taka 5,000; the defendant No. 1 having failed to refund Taka 25,000 within Chaitra 1386 BS, the plaintiff on tendering the balance consideration money requested the defendant No. 1 several times to execute and register the sale deed but the defen­dant No. 1 deferred the same on this or that plea and on 30-4-1982, corresponding to 16 Baisakh 1389 BS, he finally refused to execute and register the sale deed.<br/> <br/>3. The added defendant Nos. 3 and 4, the res­pondent Nos. 1 and 2 herein, contested the suit by filing a joint written statement contending that they purchased the suit land from the defendant No. 1 by several sale deeds and the defendant No. 1 then handed over the possession of the suit land to them and thereafter they sold some land therefrom to the defendant Nos. 8, 11, 12, 15, 16 and 17 by sale deeds dated 18-8-1981 and delivered possession of the sold lands to them and that the defendant Nos. 3 and 4 and their transferees are <em>bona fide</em> purchasers for value without notice of alleged agreement for sale dated 29-11-76 and the above defendants are in actual and physical possession of the suit land since their purchase and the alleged agreement for sale is antedated, fabricated, collusive and fraudulent and the plaintiff did not also pay Taka 25,000 and/or tendered Taka 5,000 to the defendant No. 1 and the defendant No. 1 also did not make over possession of the suit land to the plaintiff.<br/> <br/>4. The learned Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), after hearing, decreed the suit hold­ing that the plaintiff proved the agreement for sale dated 29-11-76, payment of advance Taka 25,000 and also handing over of possession of the suit land by the defendant No. 1 to the plaintiff on the date of contract and also proved possession of the plaintiff to the suit land and the defendants failed to prove the purchase of the suit land by the defendant Nos. 3 and 4 from the defendant No. 1 and also subse­quent transfer thereof by the defendant Nos. 3 and 4 to the defendant Nos. 8, 11, 12, 15, 16 and 17 and the witnesses of the defendants having materially contradicted each other as to the possession of the defendants in the suit land the possession of the defendants in the suit land was not proved. On appeal, the learned Additional District Judge Bagerhat, after hearing, dismissed the appeal on affirming all the findings of fact arrived at by the trial Court and with further findings that the witnesses Nos. 2, 3 and 4 for the defendant Nos. 3-4 did not assert that they had no knowledge of the earlier agreement for sale dated 29-11-76. The defendant Nos. 1 and 2 then moved the High Court Division and obtained Rule in CR No. 3175 of 1993 and after hearing the High Court Division made the Rule absolute holding that the defendants are <em>bona fide</em> purchasers for value without notice and this aspect of the matter has not been discussed by the courts below properly and in support of its decision the High Court Division referred to the case of <strong><em>Mukhtar Hossain Khan vs Suresh Chandra Dey, 42 DLR 86</em></strong> and the case of <strong><em>In</em></strong> <strong><em>re Karamatullah, PLD 1972 (SC) 25.</em></strong><br/> <br/>5. Leave was granted on the submissions that the High Court Division erred in law in holding that the contesting defendants are purchasers without knowledge of the earlier contract between the plaintiff and the defendant No. 1 for sale of the land in suit ignoring the concurrent finding of the Courts below that the plaintiffs are in possession of the land in suit, the High Court Division was in error in reversing the concurrent finding of facts without discussing and considering the evidence on record and without assigning any reason except holding that the defendants had no knowledge of the earlier contract for sale although the same is not a valid ground for refusing specific performance of contract and, as such, the impugned judgment of the High Court Division is not sustainable in law.<br/> <br/>6. The learned Counsel appearing for the plain­tiff/appellants submitted that the High Court Division without adverting to the concurrent finding of the courts below erroneously held that the defen­dants are <em>bona fide </em>purchasers for value without notice of the agreement for sale dated 29-11-76 and also erroneously reversed the findings of the courts below as to the possession of the plaintiff in the suit land and as to genuineness of the agreement of sale and the High Court Division also erroneously held that the onus lay on the plaintiff to prove that the defendants had knowledge of earlier agreement for sale of the suit.<br/> <br/>7. The learned Counsel for the defendants submitted that the suit was filed on the basis of antedated and fabricated agreement of sale which was without any consideration and the defendant No. 1 never entered into any such agreement with the plaintiff for sale of the land in suit and posses­sion of the land in suit was never made over to the plaintiff and the defendant No. 1 sold some portion of the suit land along with his other lands to some of the contesting defendants in between the years 1977 and 1979 and also delivered possession of the lands sold to them and further the defendants are <em>bona fide</em> purchasers for value without any notice of the agreement for sale dated 29-11-76 and that after their purchases the defendants mutated their names and paid rent to the government and the present suit has been filed by Hazratullah, the son of the defendant No. 1, in the benami of the plaintiff upon creating forged and antedated agreement for sale.<br/> <br/>8. As it appears the High Court Division just stating the submissions of the learned Advocate and referring to<strong><em> 42 DLR 86</em></strong> and <strong><em>1972 PLD (SC) 27</em></strong> held that since DW 1 deposed that she did not know about the contract for sale and the defendants were bonafide purchasers for value without notice the onus shifted to the plaintiff to prove that the defen­dants had the knowledge of contract and the plain­tiff having failed to discharge the onus is not entitled to obtain decree for specific performance of contract.<br/> <br/>9. Before dealing with the points raised by the learned Counsel for the appellants, it will be use­ful to reproduce here section 27(b) of the Specific Relief Act which is as under:<br/> <br/>"<strong>27.</strong> Except as otherwise provided by this Chapter, specific performance of a contract may be enforced against<br/>(a)..................................<br/>(b) any other person claiming under him by a title arising subsequently to the contract, except a transferee for value who had paid his money in good faith and without notice of the original contract.<br/>(c).................................<br/>(d).................................<br/>(e).............................."<br/> <br/>10.  It will thus be noticed that under the above provision of law, a contract can be specifically performed against any other person claiming title to the property arising subsequently to the original contract but an exception has been made in the case of transferee for value who has paid money to the transferor in good faith and without notice of the original contract. It is, therefore, for the transferee to prove that he was a transferee in good faith and without notice of the original contract for valuable consideration.<br/> <br/>11. This provision of law has been the subject of interpretation in two decisions of the Privy Council, namely, <strong><em>Bhup Narain Singh vs Gokul Chand Mahton AIR  1934 PC 68</em></strong> and <strong><em>Shankarlal Narayandas Mundade vs New Mofussil Co Ltd. AIR 1946 PC 97.</em></strong><br/> <br/>12.  In <strong><em>Bhup Narain Singh's case</em></strong> the Privy Council observed as under:<br/> <br/>"In their Lordships' opinion, the section lays down a general rule that the original contract may be specifically enforced against a subse­quent transferee, but allows an exception to that general rule, not to the transferor, but to the trans­feree, and, in their Lordships' opinion, it is clearly for the transferee to establish the circumstances which, will allow him to retain the benefit of transfer which <em>prima facie</em> he had no right to get. Further, the subsequent transferee is the person within whose knowledge the facts as to whether he has paid and whether he had notice of the original contract lie, and the provisions of section 103 and 106, Evidence Act, 1872, have a bearing on the question."<br/> <br/>13. In <strong><em>Shankarlal Narayandas Mundade’s case</em></strong> the Privy Council observed as under:<br/> <br/>"Their Lordships have found it unnecessary to examine the evidence which was called on behalf of the plaintiff to show that these defen­dants in fact, had notice of the earlier contract, since a decision of this Board is clear authority for the proposition that the burden of proving good faith and lack of notice lay upon the defendants."<br/> <br/>14. It is thus quite clear that in a suit for specific performance of contract the onus lies heavily on the person whose title arises subsequent to the contract to sell and he must prove that he is a transferee for value and has paid the money in good faith and without notice of the original contract.<br/> <br/>15. In the present case, as already stated, the trial Court held that the plaintiff is in possession of the suit land and the defendants failed to prove the purchase of the suit land by the defendant Nos. 3 and 4 from the defendant No. 1 and also subsequent transfers thereof by the defendant Nos. 3 and 4 in favour of the defendant Nos. 8,11,12, 15,16 and 17 and the witnesses of the defendants, having mate­rially contradicted each other as to possession of the suit land, also failed to prove possession of the defendants in the suit land and the appellate Court not only affirmed the above findings but further found that the witnesses Nos. 2, 3 and 4 for the defendant Nos. 3-4 did not assert that they had no knowledge of the earlier agreement for sale dated 29-11-1976 and thus the defendant failed to discharge this onus.<br/> <br/>16. In the case of <strong><em>Minhazuddin Talukdar vs Abdul Jalil Howlader 3 MLR (AD) 58</em></strong> it has been held that in a suit for specific performance of con­tract the essential ingredients which the plaintiff is required to prove in order to succeed in a suit for specific performance of contract, are that the bainapatra is genuine, consideration money passed bet­ween the parties and delivery of possession was given in pursuance thereof. In the case of <strong><em>Hafizur Rahman vs Government of Bangladesh and others,</em></strong> <strong><em>47 DLR 583</em></strong> it has been held that when in pursuance of a bainapatra/agreement to transfer property the intended transferee has taken possession, though the requisite legal document has not been executed, the position is the same as if document had been execu­ted against all who want to threaten or disturb the possession of such possessor.<br/> <br/>17. In the case of <strong><em>Haq Brothers vs Shamsul Haque 39 DLR 290</em></strong> it has been held that the burden of proof lies on the person who asserts that a fact exists and so mere denial by the defendants, subse­quent transferees, to the effect that they had no notice or knowledge of the agreement for sale, will not discharge the onus that rests upon them in view of section 27 of the Specific Relief Act.<br/> <br/>18. As has been stated earlier the plaintiff proved the agreement for sale dated 29-11-1976, payment of advance Taka 25,000 -and also the handing over of possession of the suit land by the defendant No. 1 to the plaintiff on the date of con­tract and also proved the possession of the plaintiff to the suit land and the defendants failed to prove the purchase of the suit land by the defendant Nos. 3 and 4 from the defendant No. 1 and also subse­quent transfer thereof by the defendant Nos. 3 and 4 to the defendant Nos. 8,11,12,15,16 and 17 and the witnesses of the defendants having materially con­tradicted each other as to the possession of the defendants in the suit land the possession of the defendants in the suit land has not been proved and the appellate Court, apart from affirming the above findings, further held that the witnesses Nos. 2, 3 and 4 for the defendant Nos. 3-4 did not assert that they had no knowledge of the earlier agreement of sale dated 29-11-1976.<br/> <br/>19. In the case of <strong><em>Khurshid Ali vs. Noorjahan Bewa 1 MLR (AD)</em></strong> <strong><em>210</em></strong> it has been held that the findings of fact arrived at on proper consideration of evidence by the trial Court cannot be interfered in revisional jurisdiction unless the same is found abso­lutely perverse. In the present case the High Court Division did not hold that the findings of the courts below are perverse. In the case of <strong><em>Rupa Jahan Begum vs Lutfe Ali Chowdhury, 1 MLR (AD) 374 = 49 DLR (AD) 73</em></strong>; it has also been held that the High Court Division generally in its revisional jurisdic­tion cannot interfere with the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the trial Court and appellate Court on proper appreciation of evidence. In the case of <strong><em>Md.</em></strong> <strong><em>Fazlul Haque vs. BM Rahman, 1 MLR (AD) 418</em></strong> it was also held that the question as to whether a bainapatra is guanine or not is a finding of fact which can be decided by proper appreciation of evidence arid such a finding of fact cannot be inter­fered with by the court in revisional jurisdiction, Further in the case of <strong><em>Shahana Alam vs. Ms Farida Begum</em></strong>, <strong><em>2 MLR (AD) 153 = 2 BLC (AD) 92</em></strong> it was also held that the High Court Division, in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction, cannot interfere with the concurrent findings of the trial Court as well as the appellate Court except on the ground, enume­rated in section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure and cannot superimpose itself as a third court for fresh appreciation of evidence. Moreover, as held in the case of <strong><em>Mohammad Yeasin Khan vs. Deputy Com­missioner Brahmanbaria, 2 MLR (AD) 211</em></strong>, the trial Court and lower appellate Court are the final courts of fact and the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the trial as well as by the lower appellate Court on proper appreciation of evidence on record cannot be interfered with by the High Court Division in its revisional jurisdiction. Further, as held in the case of <strong><em>Nurul Islam vs. Amirul Islam, 4 MLR (AD) 363 = 3 BLC (AD) 222</em></strong>, the court of appeal is the final Court of fact, when the question of fact is decided concurrently by the trial Court as well as by the appellate Court on correct appreciation of evidence on record, no interference is called for.<br/> <br/>20. In the present case the High Court Division by discussing the evidence on record did not hold the findings of the courts below are perverse for misreading, non reading and/or misconstruing the evidence on record and/or the courts below did not properly appreciate the particular parts of the evidence on record.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, we are of the view that the judgment and order of the High Court Division being not sustainable is liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/>Accordingly the appeal is allowed with cost.<br/> <br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
