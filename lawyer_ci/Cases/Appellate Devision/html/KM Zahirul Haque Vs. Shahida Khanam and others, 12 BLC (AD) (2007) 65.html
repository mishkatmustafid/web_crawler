This being the undisputed position, the suit filed much later in 1992 seeking declaration in respect of the decree passed in the suit for specific performance of contract without conse­quential relief in respect of the kabala that was obtained on execution of the decree passed in the suit for specific performance of contract, in our view, the said suit was not maintainable. We are of the opinion that on the execution and registration of the kabala pursuant to the decree passed in the suit for specific perfor­mance of contract, the same having been completed long before filing of the suit, the plaintiff was required to file the suit for removal of the cloud cast on the plaintiff's title by the kabala dated October 30,1989 executed and registered pursuant to the decree obtained by the defendant No. 1. The plaintiff having had not sought for the consequential relief in the light of the provision of section 42 of the Specific Relief Act we are of the view that plaintiff's suit was not maintainable and accordingly, the High Court Division was in error in setting aside the judgment and decree of the lower appellate Court......................….

Ruhul Amin J</strong><br/><br/>This appeal, by leave, is by the defendant against the judgment dated May 17, 2001 of a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 2310 of 1996 making the Rule absolute obtained against the judgment and decree dated June 27, 1996 of the Additional Court of Sub­ordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Dhaka in Title Appeal No. 67 of 1994 reversing the Judgment and decree dated January 29, 1994 of the 5th Additional Court of Assistant Judge, Dhaka in Title Suit No. 219 of 1992/39 of 1993 decreeing the suit and thereupon declaring the decree dated April 26, 1989 obtained in title Suit No. 291 of 1985 is not binding on the plaintiff.<br/><br/>2. The suit was filed seeking the following relief:<br/>“(ক) আদালতের দেঃ ২৯১/৮৫ মোকদ্দমা প্রচারিত ২৬-৪-৮৯ ইং তারিখের একতরফা  রায় ও ডিক্রিটি বেআইনি, অবৈধ, তঞ্বকতামূলক এবং এই রায় ও ডিক্রি বাদিনীর উপর বার্ধক্যর নহে এবং ঐ ডিক্রি বাদিনীর বিরুদ্ধে অকার্যকরী হওয়া মর্মে এক ঘোষণার ডিক্রি দিতে হুজুরের মর্জি হই ।”<br/> <br/>3. The suit was filed upon averring, inter alia, that the property shown in the schedule attached to the plaint was owned by Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed on the basis of the lease dated January 28, 1964 taken from the Government and said Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed sold the property so obtained by lease to Mrs. Anowara Begum (plaintiff's vendor) on July 25, 1981 and she entered into an agreement with the plaintiff on July 13, 1987 to sell the property for a consideration of Taka 50,000 and upon receiving Taka 45,000 out of the total consideration money executed an agreement for sale on the date as mentioned hereinbefore and on that very day also appointed an attorney to complete the registration of the kabala in respect of the land as regard which plaintiff's vendor Anowara Begum entered into an agreement for sale and the attorney registered the kabala on 16-10-1988. It is the case of the plaintiff that since her date of agreement she is possessing the property in suit by obtaining electricity, gas and WASA connection and also after purchase mutated her name and paying rent and rates to the Government and other Organisations. The further case of the plaintiff is that the defendant No. 1, i.e. appellant herein, without impleading the plaintiff obtained an <em>ex parte</em> decree on April 26, 1989 in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985. It may be mentioned the said suit was filed seeking specific performance of the contract for sale of the property in question dated November 9, 1979 between the defendant No. 1 and Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed. In the background of the aforesaid facts plaintiff filed the suit seeking the relief as mentioned hereinabove.<br/> <br/>4. The suit was contested by the defen­dant No. 1 by filing written statement denying the material averments made in the plaint and stating, inter alia, that the suit as framed is not maintainable, the suit is barred by limitation and barred by the provision of section 42 of the Specific Relief Act and bad for defect of party. It was the definite case of the defendant that on November 9, 1979 upon receiving Taka 25,000 out of the total consideration money of Taka 50,000 Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed executed an agreement for sale of the property he acquired by lease dated 28-1-1964 and made over possession of the property in question, that Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed having had not executed and registered the kabala, he (defen­dant No. 1) filed Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 for specific performance of the contract dated November 9, 1979 and the summons was served upon the defendants duly, that the said suit was decreed on April 26,1989 and the said decree was put into execution and in the said execution case kabala in respect of the land described in the schedule attached to the plaint was executed on August 28,1989 and the same was registered on September 30, 1989. It was also the case of the defendant No.1 that while he was in possession he was dispossessed by the musclemen of Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed on September 15, 1985. It was the further contention of the defendant No. 1 that Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed did not execute and register the kabala dated July 25, 1981 in favour of Anowara Begum, the vendor of the plaintiff.<br/> <br/>5. The plaintiff filed the suit stating amongst others that the defendant No. 1 obtained the <em>ex parte</em> decree in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 upon suppression of the summons and that address of Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed shown in the plaint of the said suit was not correct. It was the case of the plaintiff that he came to know about the <em>ex parte</em> decree passed in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 in July 1989 and thereafter became certain about the <em>ex parte</em> decree upon obtaining the certified copy of the judgment and decree of Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 on August 21, 1989.<br/> <br/>6. The plaintiff filed Title Suit No. 288 of 1989 on August 27, 1989 challenging legality of the decree dated April 26, 1989 obtained in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 but later on withdrew the said suit on the ground of formal defect with the liberty to sue afresh and thereupon filed the Title Suit No.219 of 1992/39 of 1993 on August 17, 1992.<br/> <br/>7. The trial Court decreed the suit on the findings that the suit was not barred by limita­tion and the suit as framed is maintainable and that the plaintiff has proved his right, title and interest in the land in suit, that from the evidence of PW 4 it is seen that the power of attorney (Exhibit 3) and the kabala dated October 16, 1988, (Exhibit 4) are genuine, that Exhibit 5 series (gas bills and electric bills) proved possession of the plaintiff, that signa­tures of Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed in Exhibit 1 (Anowara's deed) and in Exhibit C agreement dated 9-11-1979 are different, that by the kabala obtained by the defendant No.1 on the basis of the decree dated April 26,1989 in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 he has not acquired any title since by the kabala dated July 25, 1981 Syed Rafi­uddin Ahmed sold the property to Anowara Begum and consequently, Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed ceased to be the owner of the property on and from July 25, 1981, that defendant's case of dispossession on 15-9-1985 has been disproved by documentary evidence, that defendant No.1 in obtaining the <em>ex parte</em> decree in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 did not implead the person in possession, i.e. the claimant of the property, on the basis of the deed dated 25-7-1981 and 16-10-1988 and, as such, the said <em>ex parte</em> decree obtained by the defendant is not binding on the said persons, that from the evidence of DW 3 it is seen that Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed was not in possession of the property in suit since 1979, that as from 25-7-1981 Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed became title less in respect of the land in suit by selling to Anowara Begum and that the said Anowara Begum as was in possession since purchase, as such, defendant No. 1's claim in respect of the land in suit on the basis of <em>ex parte</em> decree dated April 26,1989 merits no consideration, that as Anowara Begum was not a party in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985, the decree obtained therein is not binding on the plaintiff.<br/> <br/>8. It may be mentioned plaintiff challen­ged the legality of the decree dated April 26, 1989 on the ground that the same was obtained without service of summons or, in other words on suppression of summons and that, upon showing the address of   Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed incorrectly. It is seen from the judg­ment of the trial Court the said Court being totally unmindful of the suit as framed proceeded to make decision in the suit as if the same was for making decision as regard title of the parties in suit properly. It may further be mentioned that the trial Court decreed the suit of the plaintiff upon the view that the plaintiff of Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 obtained decree therein on the basis of perjured evidence without making finding that the decree in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 was obtained upon sup­pression of summons.<br/> <br/>9. The defendant No. 1 went on appeal before the Court of District Judge, Dhaka as against the decree dated January 21, 1994 passed in Title Suit No. 39 of 1993 and the same was heard by the Additional Court of Sub-ordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Dhaka.  The appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial Court on the findings that in the background of the averments made in paragraph 13 of the plaint the plaintiff was required to seek relief as to his title but did not seek the same, that the trial Court instead of deciding whether the decree in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 was obtained by suppression of summons proceeded for deciding and finally decided how far the Court i.e. the Court that passed the decree in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985, was correct in deciding the dispute of the parties of the said suit, that as the plaintiff did not seek for declaration of his title in respect of the land in suit, as such, the suit of the plaintiff was not maintainable being hit by the provision of section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, that finding of the trial Court as regard maintainability of the suit or, in other words, not hit by the provision of section 42 of the Specific Relief Act is not supported by any reasoning, that trial Court was in error in not determining whether at all Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed made transfer to Anowara Begum and that in holding by the Exhibit 2 i.e. the agreement, between Anowara Begum and the plaintiff and Exhibit 3 i.e. Power of Attorney, executed by Anowara Begum authorising the attorney to execute the kabala in favour of the plaintiff, the plaintiff got the title in the land in suit. It may be mentioned that the trial Court upon comparing the signature of Syed Rafi­uddin Ahmed appearing in Exhibit C agreement between defendant No. 1 and Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed and in Exhibit 1 kabala said to have been executed by Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed in favour of Anowara Begum, the vendor of the plaintiff, genuineness whereof seriously challenged by the defendant No.1, took the view that signatures in the said documents were different and thereupon held that Exhibit C was not genuine.<br/> <br/>10. The plaintiff as against the judgment of the appellate Court moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained Rule. It was the contention of the plaintiff-petitioner before the High Court Division that because of the Exhibit 1, kabala of Anowara Begum, Exhibit 2 agreement between Ano­wara Begum and the plaintiff, Exhibit 3 Power of Attorney executed by Anowara Begum and Exhibit 4, kabala executed by the attorney of Anowara in favour of the plaintiff and posses­sion of the property from Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed being with the plaintiff and the plain­tiff and her vendor, Anowara Begum having not been party in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985, the plaintiff was not required to seek declaration as to her title and, as such, the suit filed by the plaintiff seeking declaration in respect of the decree passed in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 on the ground of fraud and collusion was very much maintainable.<br/> <br/>11. As against the aforesaid contention of the plaintiff-petitioner it was contended on behalf of the defendant-opposite party that because of the provision of Order XXI, rule 98 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the law enunciated in <strong><em>39 DLR 339</em></strong> and <strong><em>32 DLR 75</em></strong> in the suit for specific performance of contract filed by the defendant No. 1 impleading Syed Rafi­uddin Ahmed, the owner of the property in question, as claimed by the appellant and the respondent,  the plaintiff-petitioner  or his vendor Anowara Begum was not necessary party and that mere seeking of declaration as regard the decree in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 was not sufficient and the plaintiff, herein respondent No. 1, was required to seek decla­ration of her title as pursuant to the decree in Title Suit No. 291  of 1985 the kabala was obtained and because of which it was asserted that thereby her title as regard the property of her kabala obtained from Anowara Begum who acquired from Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed was clouded.<br/> <br/>12. The High Court Division made the Rule absolute on the findings that the decree obtained in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 was void since the plaintiff-respondent herein and her vendor in spite of their being in possession of the land in suit were not made parties and that decree obtained in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 did not affect plaintiffs title since the decree therein was obtained upon suppression of summons. The High Court Division while making the Rule absolute has placed reliance on the observation made in the case of <strong><em>Sufia Khanam Chowdhury vs. Faizun Nesa Chowdhury</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>39 DLR (AD) 46</em></strong>. In the aforesaid case it has been observed "If the suit is filed for a declaration that a written instrument, whether it is a sale deed or a court's decree, "is void", it clearly comes under section 39, since it is covered by the expression "any person against whom a written instrument is void or voidable .... may sue to have it adjudged void or voidable. But if a further prayer is included in the suit that by the void instrument the plaintiff's right has not been affected, then this prayer comes straight under section 42; similarly, if this prayer is framed in a different form, that is, the defendant acquired no right or interest thereby, it will make no difference, for this prayer is also covered by section 42. If his suit includes the reliefs that the instrument in question is void and his right has not been affected thereby and, or, the defendant acquired no right thereby, then the reliefs are covered by both sections 39 and 42. In such cases provisions of sections 39 and 42 will overlap". The learned Judge of the High Court Division has also placed reliance on the observation made in the aforesaid case "In a suit under section 39, where relief of cancellation is found necessary by the court but it has not been prayed for. The suit cannot be dismissed but the court will require the plaintiff to pay additional court fee for the relief of cancellation. In a suit under section 42, where consequential relief is found necessary but has not been prayed for the court may either dismiss the suit or direct the plaintiff to pay additional court fee for the purpose, keeping in view the general principle that a document which is void <em>abinitio </em>need not be cancelled. If a written instrument is adjudged void and it is further declared that it has not affected the plaintiff's right it need not be cancelled. The declaratory decree that the document is void and plaintiff's right has not been affected thereby will give him adequate relief. Of course, in view of this declaratory decree the instrument will not stand cancelled but will remain on record. In his own interest therefore the plaintiff should also seek the additional relief by way of setting aside the decree or canceling the deed. Section 42, as has been pointed out above, does not speci­fically provide for declaration of nullity and cancellation of a written instrument, but section 39 does so. In section 39, two kinds of documents have been referred to, one is 'void' and the other is 'voidable'. Where a document has been adjudged 'voidable' it will have to be avoided both by declaration and cancellation, and if the document is adjudged void or void <em>abinitio</em> it need not be cancelled". With due respect to the learned Judge of the High Court Division observation as quoted hereinbefore relied upon by the learned Judge in deciding the question involved in the suit, had hardly any relevancy since the point of law involved in the suit was, whether when pursuant to the decree in a suit for specific performance of contract kabala has been executed and registered and subsequent thereto suit filed seeking declaration only as to legality of the decree passed in the suit for specific perfor­mance of contract and having not prayed for any relief as against the kabala executed and registered pursuant to the decree passed in the suit for specific performance of contract, or that having not sought for declaration of title of the plaintiff as regard the property involved in the kabala executed and registered pursuant to the decree in the suit of specific performance of contract, suit so filed, as in the instant case, was maintainable.<br/> <br/>13. The settled principle of law is that a decree passed in a suit for specific performance of contract is completed by execution and registration of a kabala and thereupon title accrues in favour of the decree holder [<strong><em>34 DLR (AD) 98</em></strong>]. In the instant case certain facts are admitted or, in other words, undisputed. The property which the plaintiff and the defendant No. 1 are claiming belonged to Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed who got the same from the Govern­ment on the basis of the lease deed dated January 28, 1964. The rest of the facts of the case are as follows.<br/> <br/>14.  Plaintiff claimed the property of said Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed on the basis of pur­chase by the kabala dated 16-10-1988 in the background of the agreement for sale dated July 13, 1987 between the plaintiff and certain Anowara Begum who is said to have pur­chased the property, as claimed by the plaintiff and the defendant No. 1, from Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed by the kabala dated July 25, 1981. The appellant, who was defendant No. 1, claimed the land on the basis of the kabala executed on August 28, 1989 and registered on September 30, 1989 pursuant to a decree dated April 26, 1989 passed in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 which was filed impleding Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed as defendant who entered into an agreement on November 9, 1979 for sale of the land got by lease from Government with the plaintiff of Title Suit No. 291 of 1985.<br/> <br/>15. The plaintiff i.e. the respondent No. 1, herein filed the Title Suit No. 291 of 1992, subse­quently numbered as Title Suit No. 39 of 1993, on August 17, 1992 seeking the relief as men­tioned hereinbefore.<br/> <br/>16. The defendant No.1 i.e. appellant herein, contended before the trial Court that the suit as framed is not maintainable since the plaintiff was to seek consequential relief by way of declaration of his title in the property in question in the background of the fact that pursuant to the decree in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 a kabala has been registered in favour of the defendant No.1. The trial Court addressed the said contention upon observing that by the kabala obtained pursuant to the decree passed in the suit for specific performance of contract for sale of land did not vest any title to the defendant No. 1 since before the passing of the decree Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed, the owner of the land in question, transferred his right, title and interest to the plaintiff's vendor Anowara Begum by the kabala dated July 25, 1981 and that the plaintiff purchased the land from Anowara Begum by the kabala dated October 16,1988 prior to the decree passed in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 and the kabala executed pursuant to the decree.<br/> <br/>17. The appellate Court allowed the appeal with the finding that the plaintiff's suit was not maintainable since the plaintiff did not seek declaration of his title and interest in respect of the land in suit and, as such, the suit framed by the plaintiff was not maintainable because of the provision of section 42 of the Specific Relief Act. The High Court Division as stated hereinbefore upon placing reliance on the observation made in the case reported in <strong><em>39 DLR (AD) 46</em></strong> made the Rule absolute. The High Court Division while making the Rule absolute placing reliance on the aforemen­tioned reported case was quite unmindful of the facts of the instant case and the question of law involved in the background of the facts on record.<br/> <br/>18. Leave was granted to consider the contentions that the defendant instituted Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 seeking decree for specific performance of contract for sale of land dated November 9, 1979 and the same was decreed on April 26, 1989 and in execution of the aforesaid decree kabala was executed on August 28, 1989 and registered on August 30, 1989 and thereby acquired title and as against that plaintiff-respondent No. 1's vendor Anowara Begum said to have obtain kabala dated July 25,1981 from Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed, the original owner (through whom both the plain­tiff and the defendant No. 1 are claiming the land in question) and, as such, as the parties to the suit are claiming title from the common title holder the plaintiff-respondent was required to seek for declaration of title under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, that the High Court Division was in error in not holding that the suit as framed was not main­tainable in the absence of seeking declaration of title in respect of the property in suit.<br/> <br/>19. The learned Counsel for the appellant has submitted that the kabala by which Anowara Begum is said to have purchased the property on July 25,1981 from Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed is not a genuine one since by the said kabala the lessee Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed has transferred the lease property without obtaining permission from the lessor, that the kabala in the name of Anowara Begum is a fab­ricated document and that has been brought into existence through false personification by the plaintiff with the end in view of having the property in question as to which there has already been an agreement for sale as back as on November 9, 1979 between the appellant and Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed, the owner of the property in question. It has also been submit­ted that as the decree in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 travels to execution and registration of the kabala on September 30, 1989 long before the filing of the Title Suit No. 291 of 1992 (subse­quently renumbered Title Suit No. 39 of 1993) no relief having been sought against the kabala as well as no consequential relief i.e. decla­ration of title to the land, having been prayed the suit so filed was not maintainable. The learned Counsel continued that because of the registration of the kabala in execution of the decree obtained in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 and consequent thereupon decree passed in the aforesaid suit for specific performance of contract having had completed, the plaintiff was required to ask for declaration of title and for cancellation of the kabala and having had not asked for the said reliefs, High Court Division was in error in reversing the judg­ment and decree of the appellate Court.<br/> <br/>20. The learned Counsel for the plaintiff-respondent No.1 as against the aforesaid contentions of the appellant has submitted that if the decree dated April 26, 1989 passed in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 is adjusted void on the ground of obtaining thereof upon non-service of summons then the Court can very much grant a relief under section 39 of the Specific Relief Act by way of canceling the kabala that has been registered on September 30,1989 pursuant to the decree passed in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985. It has also been submitted that the suit framed is quite maintainable without seeking consequential relief as regard the kabala registered on September 30, 1989 in execution of the decree passed in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 since the decree obtained in the aforesaid suit was void for suppression of summons.<br/> <br/>21. The settled principle of law is that in a suit for specific performance of contract for sale of land only a decree is passed for the enforcement whereof the suit was filed and is completed by execution and registration of the kabala and thereupon title passes to the pur­chaser or, in other words, the plaintiff, in the suit for specific performance of contract [<strong><em>34 DLR (AD) 98</em></strong>].   In  the  instant   case,  the undisputed position is that long before filing of the suit i.e. Title Suit No. 291 of 1992/39 of 1993, (filed on 17-8-1992) kabala in pursuant to the decree passed in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 was executed by the Court on August 28,1989 and registered through the Court on Septem­ber 30, 1989 and consequent thereupon the decree passed in the suit for specific perfor­mance of contract was completed and thereupon title to the land passed to the plain­tiff of Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 i.e. the defen­dant No.1, the appellant. In the background of the said undisputed fact the plaintiff filed the suit seeking relief as stated hereinbefore or, in other words, seeking declaration that the decree dated April 26,1989 passed in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 was illegal, void, fraudulent, not binding on the plaintiff and not effective against the plaintiff. The plaintiff did not ask for any relief against the kabala which in reality clouded the title of the plaintiff and also did not seek relief as to his title in respect of the land.<br/> <br/>22. The learned Counsel for the appellant, in support of his contention, as stated herein­before, that plaintiff was required to seek relief against the kabala executed and registered in pursuant to the decree in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985 and having had not sought for the relief by way of cancellation of the kabala the suit was not maintainable has referred to the case of <strong><em>Sufia Khanam Chowdhury vs. Faizun Nesa Chowdhury, 39 DLR (AD) 46</em></strong> wherein it has been observed "If a written instrument is adjudged void and it is further declared that it has not affected the plaintiff's right it need not be cancelled. The declaratory decree that the document is void and plaintiff's right has not been affected thereby will give him adequate relief. Of course, in view of this declaratory decree the instrument will not stand cancelled but will remain on record. In his own interest therefore, the plaintiff should also seek the additional relief by way of setting aside the decree or canceling the deed.......Where document has been adjudged 'voidable’, it will have to be avoided both by declaration and cancellation, and if the document is adjudged void or void <em>abinitio</em> it need not be cancelled". It has already been mentioned hereinbefore that the trial Court proceeded for the disposal of the suit in the manner as if the suit has been filed seeking adjudication of the title of the parties in the suit. There is no finding in the judgment of the trial Court that the decree in Title Suit No.291 of 1985 was obtained by suppression of summons. The lower appellate Court, in the background of the materials on the record, set aside the judgment of the trial Court on the finding that without seeking declaration of title and interest in respect of the land in suit plaintiff's suit was not main­tainable. The High Court Division set aside the judgment of the lower appellate Court placing reliance on the observation of this Court as quoted hereinbefore in the case reported in <strong><em>39 DLR (AD) 46</em></strong>. In the said case primarily point of law came up for consideration was the scope of sections 39 and 42 of the Specific Relief Act or, in other words, what the provi­sions of the said two sections contemplate and in the background of the provision of the said two sections what relief can be sought by a party who is not a party to the kabala or the decree and that when the decree is void or void <em>abinitio</em> and voidable.<br/> <br/>23. In the instant case, the point for determination is, while the decree in a suit for specific performance of contract for sale of land completed by execution and registration of the kabala and thereupon as title in land has already passed to the decree holder, whether a suit filed subsequent to registration of kabala seeking declaration against the decree in the suit for specific performance of contract as illegal and void and not binding on the plain­tiff is maintainable or the party who  is challenging the legality of the decree passed in the suit for specific performance of contract while the kabala has been executed  and registered pursuant to the said decree would be required to seek declaration against the kabala also as well as declaration of his title as to the land. It may be mentioned the plaintiff of the instant suit was not a party in the decree passed in Title Suit No. 291 of 1985.<br/><br/>24. The learned Counsel for the appellant has also referred to the case of <strong><em>Munsur Ali Mallik vs. Md Nurul Haque Mallik and others </em></strong>reported in<strong><em> 1986 BCR (AD) 56</em></strong> in support of his contention that plaintiff was required to seek consequential relief in the suit by way of cancel­lation of the kabala registered on September 30, 1989 pursuant to the decree passed in Title Suit No.291 of 1985 and also for declaration of his title in the land of kabala registered on September 30, 1989. As stated hereinbefore, the plaintiff, herein respondent No. 1, was not a party in the Title Suit No. 291 of 1985. In the above mentioned reported case suit was filed seeking declaration against the decree in Title Suit No. 69 of 1961 alleging same was fraudulent, void, collusive, inoperative and not binding upon the plaintiff (as in the instant case) since previously in the Title Suit Nos.108 and 275 of 1958 plaintiff's title was declared to the suit land and that he came to know about the decree obtained in Title Suit No. 69 of 1961 in respect of the land as regard which plain­tiff's title has been declared in earlier suits. It was the contention of the plaintiff that the decree in Title Suit No. 69 of 1961 was obtained by suppression of summons. The plaintiff filed the suit contending that the decree passed in Title Suit No.69 of 1961 clouded his title and, as such, he was constrained to file the suit, Title Suit No. 49 of 1970. The trial Court decreed the suit. The appellate Court set aside the decree of the trial Court on the finding that as the defendant challenged the possession of the plaintiff, it was necessary for the plaintiff to file a regular suit seeking declaration of title and confirmation of possession in the disputed land and in that suit the plaintiff could also challenge the legality of the impugned decree. The appellate Court was of the view that plaintiff's suit was barred under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act and, as such, was not maintainable. On appeal to the High Court Division, it was held that the suit was not maintainable in view of the provision of section 42 of the Specific Relief Act since the plaintiff did not seek consequential relief which he could ask for in the suit. It was also noticed by the High Court Division that in Title Suit No. 69 of 1961 plaintiff was not a party and in that background of the fact it was observed by the High Court Division that "the suit for declaration that the decree passed in TS No. 69 of 1961.....is void could not be entertained" and thereupon the appeal was dismissed. The plaintiff obtained leave for consideration whether the suit for declaration of title simpliciter could be maintained. In the background of the relief sought i.e. seeking declaration that the decree passed in Title Suit No. 69 of 1961 was fraudulent, void, collusive, inoperative and not binding upon the plaintiff, it was held that the suit so filed seeking "declaration simpliciter when the plaintiff should have asked for consequential relief that was not done" was not maintainable since "In view of the clear proviso to section 42 of the Specific Relief Act there is no hesitation in saying that without prayer for consequential relief such suit should not be maintained. <em>Ratio decidendi</em> of the decision is that when a person has filed a suit seeking mere decla­ration that the decree passed in a suit wherein he is not a party is void and not binding on him or his interest has not been affected the suit so filed is not maintainable as he is to require to seek consequential relief. So, when the suit is filed seeking declaration against the decree in the previous suit wherein the plaintiff of the subsequent suit was not a party the suit so filed in the absence of seeking consequential relief is not maintainable.<br/> <br/>25. The learned Counsel for the respon­dent, in support of his submission that the suit as framed was very much maintainable with­out seeking consequential relief, either decla­ration of title or cancellation of the sale deed or for a declaration that the sale deed executed and registered pursuant to the decree in the suit for specific performance of contract, would not affect the title of the plaintiff in the land which he has purchased by the kabala dated October 16, 1988 from Anowara Begum who purchased the land by the kabala dated July 25,1981 from Syed Rafiuddin Ahmed, the original owner, on the basis of lease dated January 28, 1964, has referred to the case of <strong><em>Mohesh Chandra Missra vs. SM Nistarini Dassya and another </em></strong>reported in <strong><em>27 CWN, 449</em></strong>. In our view, the decision is of no useful purpose for substantiating the contention that plaintiff was not required to seek for consequential relief or, in other words, the suit was maintainable without the consequential relief because of the decision of this Court as mentioned herein­before reported in <strong><em>1986 BCR (AD) 56</em></strong>. The case reported in CWN, referred to by the learned Counsel for the respondent, was filed seeking declaration that the disputed tenancy was held by the plaintiff under the Biswaser and the Deys and not by the third defendant under the first defendant and also for a declaration that the decree obtained by the first defendant against the third defendant and the sale in consequence thereof were fraudulent and collusive. The fact of the case, in short, was that the plaintiff was a tenant under the Biswaser and the Deys and he held tenancy under the first defendant. The first defendant, ignoring the interest of the Biswaser and the Deys and also his own interest in the property, fraudu­lently instituted a rent suit against the third defendant as if the third defendant was his tenant in respect of the disputed land. The suit was decreed <em>ex-parte</em> and the sale which followed the second defendant became the purchaser of the tenancy. It may be mentioned in the rent suit plaintiff was not impleaded although he was, in fact, the tenant of the land. In the background of the aforesaid fact, the plaintiff filed the suit seeking the aforementioned reliefs. The trial Court decreed the suit but the appellate Court dismissed the suit on the finding that the same was barred under the provision of section 42 of the Specific Relief Act since consequential relief by way of injunction was not prayed for. In the reported case it has been held that the suit was very much maintainable on the finding that in the background of the facts and circumstances of the case plaintiff was not required to ask for an injunction.<br/> <br/>26. The decision in the case reported in <strong><em>27 CWN 449</em></strong> because of our own decision as re­ported in <strong><em>1986 BCR (AD) 56</em></strong> has no persuasive value for us. In the case reported in <strong><em>1986 BCR (AD) 56</em></strong> it has been held that if a suit is filed by a person seeking declaration against a decree wherein he is not a party the same would not be maintainable because of the absence of consequential relief or, in other words, for nonseeking consequential relief.<br/> <br/>27. The learned Counsel for the respondent No. 1 has also referred to the case of <strong><em>Tarak Chandra Majhi vs. Atahar Ali Howlader and others reported in 8 BLC (AD) 67 </em></strong>in support of the contention that the suit framed was very much maintainable without seeking conse­quential relief. The facts of the instant case is quite different from the facts of the reported case and, as such, is of no help to the respon­dent for substantiating the contention that the suit framed by him was maintainable without seeking consequential relief. The facts of the reported case, in short, are that defendant of the said suit, on the basis of a forged 'Ekrar-nama', filed a Miscellaneous case against the plaintiff before the Revenue Authority under section 95 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act and obtained an order for re-conveyance. The plaintiff approached the Revenue Autho­rity for setting aside the Miscellaneous case but the Revenue Authority at the upazila level directed the plaintiff to file appeal as against the order and accordingly, the plaintiff filed appeal before the Additional Deputy Commis­sioner (Revenue) but the same was dismissed. Thereafter plaintiff filed appeal in the office of the Additional Divisional Commissioner, Khulna who allowed the appeal, the defendant went on further appeal before the Board of Land Administration and the Board set aside the order of the Additional Divisional Com­missioner. Thereupon, the plaintiff filed the suit seeking declaration that the order of the Land Appeal Board was illegal, void and not binding upon the plaintiff. The trial Court dismissed the suit and on appeal the judgment and decree of the trial Court was reversed. The defendant moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and the High Court Division made the Rule absolute. From the defendant's side there was contention as to maintainability of the suit on the ground of not seeking declaration of title as well as regard the 'Ekrarnama' which is said to have been executed by the plaintiff with the stipulation of re-conveyance. This Court as regard the maintainability of the suit in the background of the aforesaid contention of the defendants held, "since the suit has been filed against the order by which plaintiff's title to the land in suit was clouded and that no specific relief the plaintiff was required to seek against the Ekrarnama since the decree sought for against the order of the Land Administration Board would remove the cloud created by the order impugned and thereupon the Ekrarnama relating to plaintiffs land would have no bearing upon the land of the plaintiff's. In the background of the facts and circumstances of the reported case since the relief sought was complete one and that in case of granting thereof the cloud that was cast on the title of the plaintiff by the order of the Land Appeal Board was removed and, as such, he was not required to seek for consequential relief.<br/> <br/>28. In the instant case from the materials on record it is seen that prior to the filing of the suit the defendant No.1 obtained the kabala on October 30, 1989 in execution of the decree passed in the suit for specific performance of contract for sale of land and consequent thereupon the decree was completed by the execution and registration of the kabala. This being the undisputed position, the suit filed much later in 1992 seeking declaration in respect of the decree passed in the suit for specific performance of contract without conse­quential relief in respect of the kabala that was obtained on execution of the decree passed in the suit for specific performance of contract, in our view, the said suit was not maintainable. We are of the opinion that on the execution and registration of the kabala pursuant to the decree passed in the suit for specific perfor­mance of contract, the same having been completed long before filing of the suit, the plaintiff was required to file the suit for removal of the cloud cast on the plaintiff's title by the kabala dated October 30,1989 executed and registered pursuant to the decree obtained by the defendant No. 1. The plaintiff having had not sought for the consequential relief in the light of the provision of section 42 of the Specific Relief Act we are of the view that plaintiff's suit was not maintainable and accordingly, the High Court Division was in error in setting aside the judgment and decree of the lower appellate Court.<br/> <br/>29. In the background of the discussions made hereinabove we find merit in the appeal.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the appeal is allowed without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/>                                                </div></div></div>
