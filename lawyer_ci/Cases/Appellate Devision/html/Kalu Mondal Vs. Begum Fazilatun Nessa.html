Aftab Hossain, Advocate-on-Record-For the Respondent.<br/> <br/><strong>Civil Appeal Nos. 171 of 1979 and 76 of 1980 from Civil Rule 1170 of 1973 and 1219 of 1974. </strong><br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></div> <div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ruhul Islam J:</strong>These two appeals were heard analogously and are, being disposed of by this judgment. Facts, in short, are that the respondent instituted two separate suits for ejectment of the appellants from the respective suit premises on the ground that they were defaulters. The suits were instituted after serving notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. It was alleged that the appellant Kalu Mondal was in arrear in payment of rent from February, 1971 to April 1972, and appellant Naushad Ali was in arrear in payment of rent from April 1971 to August 1972. Both the suits were contested by the tenants by filing separate written statement denying the plaint case of default in payment of rent. The tenant's case is, that due to war of liberation he had to quit the suit premises for fear of life and that they returned after the liberation. His further case is, that the premises concerned was damaged by the Pak Army. He repaired the same but the landlord did not pay the expenditure incurred by him and that he was assured by the landlord that the cost incurred by him would be adjusted against rents payable by him. The premises which is the subject-matter in Civil Appeal No. 171 of 1979 is a small pan‑shop; and the promises which is the subject matter in Civil Appeal No. 76 of 1980 is a small cloth shop. The learned SCC Judge accepted the case of the defendant in both the cases that the suit premises were damaged by the Pak Army and these were repaired by the defendants at their own cost which was not adjusted by the landlord. According to the trial Court, the defendant in both the cases "should get the benefit of the abnormal circumstances of the period in question".<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong> Leave was grated to consider whether in view of the finding of the trial Court section 18(5) of Premises Rent Control Ordinance should be interpreted in the context of the abnormal conditions prevailing in the year 1971, that is, whether the conditions like war of liberation should be read in the statutory provision as exception clause to the sub‑section.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> Mr. Golam Rabbani, the learned Advocate appearing for the appellants, submitted that in view of the undisputed position that the war of liberation intervened and the appellants had to leave the premises out of fear of life, and the premises were damaged by the Pak Army and the same were repaired by the appellants and the expenditures incurred by them were not adjusted against rent dues although the landlord had given the assurance that the expenditures would be adjusted, the trial Court was justified in taking the view that the tenants should get the benefit of the abnormal circumstances of the period in question. In support of this contention the learned Advocate placed his reliance upon the observations made in a decision of this Court in the case of <strong><em>Ramjan Ali Mistry Vs. Hedayetullah, 31 DLR (SC) 183</em></strong>. The said decision shows that in construing the language of sub‑section (5) of section 18 of the Ordinance the following observation has been made:<br/> <br/>"It is true that enquiry about compliance of the provisions of the statute may call for consideration of facts at each point. There may be a case of waiver or acquiescence or such supervening facts and circumstances as to make the compliance with the enactment beyond the control of the tenant. However, it will depend on the facts of a particular case to see whether there has been default in the payment of rent in terms of the statute but once the fact is established in terms of the Ordinance, legal consequence flowing therefrom cannot be averted."<br/> <br/>On the basis of the above noted observation the learned Advocate submitted that the trial Court on consideration of the evidence of the case and the supervening circumstances as disclosed from the evidence arrived at a correct finding as follows:<br/> <br/>"Further the defendant effected repairs to the suit promises at his own cost which he does not want to be adjusted with the rent. I think the defendant should get the benefit of the abnormal circumstance of the period in question."<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate submitted that the learned Single Judge of the High Court did not give any consideration to this aspect of the case, namely, that the abnormal situation prevailing in the year 1971, effect of which still continued for some time even after liberation, were beyond the control of the tenant.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> On perusal of the judgment of the learned Single Judge it appears that he totally omitted to consider as to whether the situation prevailing at that time prevented the tenant from complying with the requirements of the law to get the protection as provided therein. From the judgment it appears that the learned Judge did not accept the case of the tenant that he effected the necessary repairs to the damaged premises. On this question the teamed Judge observed as follows:<br/> <br/>"In the written statement he does not say anything about the damage to the house, the repairs or other things. In that view of the matter the learned SCC Judge was wrong in holding that the defendant effected the repairs of the suit premises at his own cost."<br/> <br/>The above observation is not warranted by the evidence on record. The landlord's witness PW I Md. Sultan Ahmed alias Abdul Jalil, an agent of the plaintiff, admitted at the trial that the war of liberation practically began in the month of February, 1971 and defendant left the suit premises in the month of April, 1971 and the suit premises was partly damaged by the Pak Army to which the plaintiff has not effected any repair, From the admission of PW 1 it appears that the tenant's case on this point remained practically uncontroverted. PW 1 also admitted that the tenant paid rent regularly upto January, 1971 and defaulted in payment of rents from February 1971. Moreover, it is a finding of fact. In the circumstances it was incumbent upon the Court to consider whether the prevailing abnormal circumstances prevented the tenant from paying rent to the landlord. The trial Court on consideration of the evidence found that in view of the abnormal condition prevailing in the country at the relevant time the default in payment of rent would not disentitle him from the protection. The learned Judge, however, appears to have totally omitted to consider this vital aspect. He disposed of the case on the view that since admittedly the tenant defaulted in payment of rent, the consequences of the law must follow. In view of default the tenant is not entitled to the benefit of protection provided by the statute.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> Section 18(5) of the Ordinance provides that no tenant shall be entitled to the statutory protection as provided in this section unless he pays the rent due in respect of the premises to the full extent allowable under the Ordinance within the time fixed in the contract with his landlord or in the absence of such contract by the 15th day of the month next following that for which the rent is payable; or unless the tenant has deposited such rent and any subsequent rent in respect of such premises as provided in section 19 together with the cost of transmission by postal money order to the landlord in the cases mentioned in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of that section. The provision of law as contained in sub‑section (5) of section 18 clearly contemplates an enquiry as to whether the tenant was entitled to the benefit of the protection from ejectment at the instance of the landlord due to non‑payment of rent. The enquiry becomes all the more necessary when the tenant comes with a positive case supported by evidence that due to some kind of abnormal situation supervening at the relevant time it was beyond his control to pay rent. In contemplation of such a situation it has been observed by this Court in the case of <strong><em>Ramjan Ali Mistry Vs. Hedayetullah</em></strong> mentioned above, that there may be a case of waiver or acquiescence or such supervening facts and circumstances as to make the compliance with the enactment beyond the control of the tenant. In the instant case the trial Court accepted the tenant's case that the situation prevailing at the relevant time made it impossible for the tenant to pay rent, although prior to that rent was regularly paid, which the landlord's witness also admitted.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> The learned Single Judge again committed an error in not accepting the case of damage caused to the premises in question by the Pak Army although the landlord's witness PW I admitted in his deposition. In both the cases the learned Judge reversed the finding of fact by substituting his own finding which does not get support from the evidence on record. In our opinion, the learned Single Judge was in error in reversing the finding of fact. On that ground alone judgment appealed from in either of the cases cannot be sustained. In the result both the appeals are allowed with costs. The judgments of the High Court are set aside and those of the trial Court are restored.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>
