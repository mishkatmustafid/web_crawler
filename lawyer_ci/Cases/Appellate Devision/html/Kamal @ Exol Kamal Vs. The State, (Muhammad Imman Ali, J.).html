When the victim Giasuddin came out from inside his house, the convict-appellant opened fire from his firearm indiscriminately aiming at him, on the road near the wall of Bond Fabrics,close to the house, inflicting multiple bleeding injuries on the person of the victim. Convict Ibu, Rubel, Janu and Kala Rafique also shot him from their respective firearms and, thereafter, they went away towards the west. The victim was then taken to Khanpur Hospital by the informant and P.W.10 Ali Hossain and one Zaker. In the Hospital the doctor on duty declared him dead. The informant’s father used to protest the evil acts and misdeeds of the convict persons and he also formed a peace committee locally to maintain law and order in the area and out of the grudge the accused persons killed the victim Giasuddin by gun-shots. The informant, his mother, brother, wife, younger sister and others saw the occurrence by electric light. Hence, he lodged the FIR.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">We find from the record that during investigation of the case, the police visited the place of occurrence, held inquest over the dead body of the victim and sent the same to the hospital morgue for postmortem examination, examined the witnesses under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, seized the alamats as per seizure lists, prepared the sketch map of the P.O. with separate index and after having found strong prima facie case against the accused persons, submitted charge sheet against the convict appellant and eight others.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Then the case record was finally sent for disposal before the Sessions Judge, Narayanganj and at the commencement of the trial charge was framed under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code against all of them, apart from charge-sheeted accused Ibrahim @ Ibu who died in the meantime.

He further submitted that the conviction of the appellant is against the weight of evidence and materials on record. The convict appellant (condemned prisoner) is totally innocent of the charge leveled against him and he has been falsely implicated in the case and he is not in any way involved with the alleged murder. He submitted that P.W.1 is the wife of the deceased, P.W.2 is the informant, a son of the victim, P.W.3 is the daughter, P.W.4 is the son and P.W.5 is the daughter-in-law of the deceased, who are alleged to be eye witnesses of the occurrence and stated in their evidence that the convict appellant fired shots on the deceased with a pistol. But the informant did not mention in the FIR that the convict appellant fired pistol shot on the deceased and only mentioned it as "firearm". The doctor who held the postmortem examination on the dead body of the deceased could not identify the injuries caused on the body of the deceased, whether they were by pistol or by revolver shots, which creates doubt and the appellant is entitled to get the benefit of doubt. He submitted that no case under the Arms Act was filed against the convict appellant nor the alleged pistol was recovered from his possession, which proves that he has been falsely implicated with the alleged occurrence out of previous enmity. He submitted that the convict appellant did not make any confession under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and P.W.6 is the doctor, P.Ws.7, 8, 9, 10 (declared hostile) 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 are not eye witnesses and P.Ws.17, 18 and 19 are police personnel's. He submitted that the most vital and independent witnesses who took the victim to the hospital, i.e. Ali Hossain was examined as P.W.10 who was tendered and Zakir was not examined which creates doubt as to whether anyone saw the occurrence. P.Ws.1, 2, 4 and 5 made contradictory statements and at the time of holding inquest none stated anything, which proves they are not the eye witnesses.

The trial Court noted that the learned Advocate for the defence could not elicit any serious contradiction from the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses. It was also noted that the victim Gias Uddin was a Muktijoddha and Adviser to the local Law and Order Committee and was active against the terrorist activities of the accused persons. He also took part in the <em>shalish </em>and decided against the accused persons, as a result of which they became angry which ultimately led to the victim being mercilessly murdered.

However, we cannot ignore the fact that the occurrence took place at 8 O’clock at night when the victim had just returned home and the appellant and other accused persons came to the house of the victim and called him outside and the victim was shot by the appellant a few feet away from his gate. The witnesses recognised the assailants by electric light. Naturally, the inhabitants of his household would be the persons who would witness the occurrence from close quarters. The wife, children and daughter-in-law of the victim are the most natural and competent witnesses in the facts and circumstances of the case. We note that P.W.7, who is a local shopkeeper, deposed that he came to the place of occurrence on hearing shots, saw the victim, who had been shot and also saw the appellant and co-accused Junu running away from the place of occurrence. He stated that he did not know the names of the other assailants. The evidence of P.W.7 is thus independent corroborative evidence of the occurrence.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">17.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">We note from the evidence of the Investigating Officer that no contradictions were elicited from him in respect of the statements of the witnesses recorded under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">18.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">P.W. 6, the doctor, who deposed with regard to the post mortem report, stated that he found 10 bullet injuries on the chest and other parts of the victim’s body. The learned Advocate on behalf of the appellant tried to argue that there was no clear evidence as to whether the injuries were caused by a pistol or by a revolver. In this regard we have to say that to a lay person there is little difference between a pistol and a revolver both fire bullets. The only real distinction is that the revolver has a revolving chamber from which the bullets are fired, whereas a pistol may have a magazine containing between 7 to 16 bullets. The fact remains, the victim suffered as many as 10 bullet injuries, which according to the eye witnesses, were fired from short range.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">19.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The learned Advocate for the appellant finally submitted that the sentence of death may be commuted in view of the age of the convict, contradiction in the evidence of the witnesses and the lack of independent corroborative evidence.

Ten bullet injuries were found on the victim, which is indicative of the vehemence with which the victim was done to death.

Hence, it cannot be said that the action of the accused was resultant from his immaturity of mind. His action was purposeful and intentional, which led to cold-blooded murder of the victim.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">24.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The facts of the case taken as a whole naturally give rise to the apprehension that the appellant would not desist from committing a similar offence when it suited him.
