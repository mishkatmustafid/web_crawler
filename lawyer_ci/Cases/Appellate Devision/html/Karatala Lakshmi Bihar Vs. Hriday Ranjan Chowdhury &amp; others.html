Leave was granted to consider whether the Buddhists in Bangladesh are governed by the Hindu Law in mailers of succession.<br/> <br/>3. Facts are as follows: - Plaintiff instituted the suit for declaration of title and confirmation of possession in the suit land alternatively for recovery of possession together with a prayer for declaration that the Nirupannama dated 14.3.37 was illegal, null and void and not binding on the plaintiff. Plaintiff is the son of Tripura. The land originally belonged to one Lakshmi Charan Bartia who died leaving behind a widow Kumari Barua and two daughters namely Tripura and Promilla. On Lakshmi's death his widow Kumari got life interest. Kumari died leaving daughters Tripura and Pramila who also got life interest in the property. On Tripura's death her interest devolved upon her sister Prami­la for life time. Pramila died in 1937 leaving behind five daughters, defendant No. 2 and others. Pramila Sundari executed a document called Nirupannama in favour of the Chief Priest of Lakshmi Bihar. This document was assailed by the plaintiff as being frau­dulent and collusive inasmuch as it has affected the reversioners and their interest. The defendant threa­tened the plaintiff with dispossession and hence the suit.<br/> <br/>4. Defendant resisted the suit and contended that the plaintiff is not entitled to any relief. The trial Court found that the plaintiff is out of possession of the suit land and his remedy is to bring a suit for par­tition. In that view of the matter the trial Court dis­missed the suit as being not maintainable. On appeal the learned Subordinate Judge took a contrary view and decreed the suit. In a Second Appeal the High Court Division considered the question of applicabil­ity of the law and the contention of the plaintiff that the Buddhists of Chittagong are governed by Dayabhaga Hindu Law in matters of succession. If the Hin­du Law is applicable then a female heir with limited interest may alienate the estate for legal necessity and also for certain religious and charitable purpose. The question was whether Ext. I Niruponnama was valid even after the death of Pramila and if it is valid then plaintiff gets nothing. On consideration of decisions cited at the bar the High Court Division affirmed the judgment and order of the appellate court below and decreed the suit declaring that the plaintiffs title to one-third share in the suit property excluding. R.S. Plot No. 1519 of item No.6 of Schedule 1 and further the plaintiff do get joint possession with the contest­ing defendants and defendants 3 and 4 in the suit land and declared that Ext. I is void and inoperative.<br/> <br/>5. Leave was granted to consider whether the Hindu Law is applicable in the case.<br/> <br/>6. In the instant case the plaintiff contended that the Buddhists of Bangladesh are governed by Dayabhaga Hindu Law in matters of succession. The defendants did not contest the proposition cither in the written statement or at the trial. The learned Sin­gle Judge observed:<br/> <br/>“As a matter of fact, both the parties agreed that the Dayabhaga School of Hindu Law would govern the succession in the present case."<br/>Civil litigation is an adjudication of dispute be­tween the litigants and the decree is given on the pleadings. Decree is a final decision of the Court. No issue was raised at the trial nor was the point in controversy.<br/> <br/>7. Mr. S.R. Pal learned Counsel contended that even now the point can be decided since impor­tant point of law has been raised on status and reli­ance was placed on <em><strong>32 DLR (HCD) 187.</strong></em> The learned Judge noticed that <em><strong>32 DLR 187</strong></em> based its decision on Indian amendments of 1956. These amendments have not been made in the Succession Act in Ban­gladesh. The Division Bench in that case observed:<br/> <br/>"In 1956, Hindu law in India was amended and the Buddhists of India were brought within the ambit of the Hindu Law. But in our country no such amendment has been made. As such it cannot be said that Buddhists of our country arc governed by Hindu Law with regard to succes­sion."<br/> <br/>This conclusion, with respect, appears to be very sweeping. Shastri's Hindu Law (1940 ed.) cites a ruling of the Calcutta High Court that the Budd­hists of Bengal are governed by Bengal School of Hindu Law (<em><strong>Mondodari Vs. Kshitendra S. A. No. 2256 of 1931 </strong></em>( at page 46<em>).</em> The amendments of 1956 were made to bring the law in conformity with the judicial decisions. But this point need not be pursued further because as it has been noticed that the plaintiff and the defendant both took the position that the Hindu Law is applicable in their case. So where was the controversy? A court of law does not decide a point <em>in vacuo</em>. Decree means "the formal expression of an adjudication which so far as regards the court expressing it conclusively determines the right of the parties with regard to all or <u>any of the mailers in controversy</u> in the suit." Where there is no controversy, the Court is not expected to lay down a law on supposed controversy. As for the other questions whether the parties should be gov­erned by principles of equity, justice and good con­science they do not merit consideration because here there was no controversy and no body had alleged anything to the contrary. The point rests there. The appeal is therefore, dismissed. No costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>
