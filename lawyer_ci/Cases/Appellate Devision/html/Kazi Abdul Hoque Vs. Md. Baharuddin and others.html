Hassan Ameen J:</strong>This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order 21-05-2006 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Writ Petition No.3129 of 2004 making the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>2. The petitioner's case, in brief, is that the petitioner took active part in the liberation war in 1971 and Mr. M.A.G. Osmani, Commander-in-Chief, presented a certifi­cate to the petitioner as a freedom fighter. Another freedom fighter certificate has also been issued by the Ministry of Liberation War Affairs. The respondent No. 2, Chittagong Development Authority (CDA) floated a notice to sell some residential plots at the Chandgaon Residential Project (2nd phase) and the same was pub­lished on 01-09-2000 in the Daily Azadi, inviting applications from the interested persons for the allotment of residential plots. The petitioner made an application on 16.09.2000 with a deposit of Tk.1,50,000/- as security money through Social Investment Bank Ltd. Agrabadh Branch, Chittagong. As per Rule 7(2) of the Chittagong Development Authority Residential Plots Allotment Rules (here­inafter called as the Rules), after scrutiny the application of the petitioner was accepted by the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 and as per Rule 8(1), the list of the allot­ments were placed before the 329th General Meeting of the Board dated 29-10-2003 and the Preliminary list of the allottees was approved by the Authority and the same was published in the Daily Azadi on 30-10-2003.<br/> <br/>3. The name of the petitioner was pub­lished in the said list in serial No.5. The proceedings of the 329th General Meeting were approved in the 330th General Meeting of the Board on 20-11-2003. The Authority in their 331st Meeting dated 02-12-2003 finalized the Preliminary list as per Rule 8 (5) and 8 (6) and in pursuant to the decision dated 02-12-2003 the respon­dent No.2 issued allotment letters in favour of the different allottees on 2nd, 3rd and 4th December, 2003 but no allot­ment letter was issued in favour of the petitioner. The Secretary of the Plot Allotment Committee respondent No.6 issued a notice on 24-12-2003 to the peti­tioner intimating that one Kazi Abdul Haque and Md. Kamor Uddin have raised objection against the allotment of the peti­tioner alleging that the certificate of the petitioner as freedom fighter issued under the signature of M.A.G. Osmani, Commander-in-Chief of the Liberation War is not proper and acceptable as the same was not in accordance with the cir­cular of the Bangladesh Government issued in 1988 and that the three storied building situated at Chittagong City Town in the name of petitioner's brother Mr. Giasuddin are the joint property of the petitioner and his brother. The petitioner on 30-12-2003 submitted his reply against the complaint dated 24-12-2003 stating that he took active part in the Liberation War in 1971 and as a freedom fighter, he collected his certificate from the Commander-in-Chief, Mr. M.A.G. Osmani and that he has collected another certificate dated 28-12-2003 issued by the Ministry of Liberation War Affairs and submitted the same to the Plot Allotment Committee on 30-12-2003.<br/> <br/>4. The petitioner has no property within the Chittagong City Town or elsewhere and he never purchased any property jointly with his brother. His elder brother namely Mr. Gias Uddin has purchased two gonda land at 'Niribili Housing Society' of the Chittagong City Town and the said property is his personal property. The peti­tioner and his other brothers have no right, title and interest in the purchased 1150 satangsha and 100 satangsha land from B.S. plot No.233/234 under B.S. Khatian No. 1058 vide kabala No.8794 dated 14-12-2002 for fishing project. From B. S. Khatian it would be clear that the pur­chased land is almost a pond. There is no vacant residential plot in that purchased property. The petitioner has no residential plot for residing in Chittagong City Town. The petitioner resides as a tenant in a rent­ed house. The allegation against the peti­tioner is totally false, collusive and has got no basis. The petitioner requested the respondent No.2 to issue allotment letter in favour of him and thereafter repeatedly requested the respondents in writing but no reply was given by the respondent.<br/> <br/>5. Some interested persons made those allegations, which are totally false and baseless. The petitioner further contended that as per Rule 4 (I) of the Plot Allotments Rules, the Plot Allotment Committee consists of five members but a three members committee without consid­ering the application (Annexure-I), where he has clearly stated that he has filed the Freedom Fighter Certificate granted by the Ministry on 30-12-203 and that the petitioner purchased a part of marshy land, in their resolution dated 01-03-2004 pro­posed for cancellation of the allotment of the petitioner form the preliminary and final list. The resolution of the Plot Allotment Committee was approved by the Board of Chittagong Development Authority on 10-03-2004 without consid­ering the certificate filed by the petitioner and also without considering that no fact was suppressed by the petitioner about his purchase of marshy land. Thereafter, the petitioner served a demand justice notice upon the respondents requesting them to withdraw the cancellation order of allot­ment of the petitioner but no effect and as such the petitioner has filed this writ peti­tion under Article 102 of the Constitution for appropriate relief.<br/> <br/>6. During the pendency of the Rule, one Kazi Abdul Haque having been added as  respondent No.7 in this Rule filed an affidavit-in-opposition alleging that the residential plot allotment Rules, 1988 has made a bar to the people, who has residential land in Chittagong City Corporation Area either in his own name or in the name of his family members to get an allotment of a residential plot and that the authority after holding the investigation found that the petitioner has purchased a plot in the Chittagong City corporation area and that the freedom fighter certifi­cate submitted by the petitioner along with the application for allotment was not prop­er as the same was not filed keeping inconformity with the circular of the allot­ment. Since the Authority found that the allegations against the petitioner was established, and accordingly excluded his name from the preliminary and final lists of the residential plot allotment.<br/> <br/>7. Mr. Abdul Qauiyum, the learned Senior Advocate, appearing for the petitioner, submits that the High Court Division did not consider the application for allotment by the respondent No.1 Annexure-C since it was not accompanied with valid free­dom fighter certificate as per the decision of the Ministry dated 17-08-1988 thus the application ought not have taken up for consideration at all and ignorance of the respondent No.1 could not be an excuse. He further submits that the High Court Division did not consider the preliminary list Annexure-d (1) dated 30-10-2003 shows that it contained a clause inviting objection on the ground whether the allot­tee has any residential plot within the City Corporation and it appears that the respon­dent No.1 acquired 1250 acres of land in front of Sattar Bhaban being Plot No. 1914 of the Housing Estate, Halishahar within the City Corporation situated at the corner of the City Corporation road on 14-12-2002 and said acquisition in Urban area by no stretch on imagination can be said to have been acquired for fishing project thus the High Court Division committed an error of law occasioning failure of justice. He lastly submitted the High Court Division wrongly relied upon Annexure-O prepared during the pendency of the writ petition in violation of the order of status-quo and made the rule absolute thus com­mitted error of law occasioning failure of justice.<br/> <br/>8. We have heard the learned Advocate for the petitioner and perused the materials available in record and reasons to believe that the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner have got no merit and accordingly, the petition for leave to appeal is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
