The short fact leading to this petition is that the opposite party No.1 preemptor filed Miscellaneous Case No. 8 of 1998 for pre-emption of the case land under section 24 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act in the court of the Subordinate Judge, Patuakhali alleging that he is a co-sharer in the case land and is entitled to preemption.<br/> <br/>3. Pre-emptee-petitioners entered appearance and filed written objection denying the allegations and their case is that the preemptors is not a co-sharer to the case land and is not entitled to any preemption.<br/> <br/>4. It appears that on the pleadings of the parties the learned Subordinate Judge started trial and recorded evidence of the witnesses and when he was about to dispose of the case on merit the present petitioners made a prayer for rejection of the application for pre-emption under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure contending inter alia that it did not disclose any cause of action and that it was barred by law. The learned Subordinate Judge on hearing the parties and on perusal of the materials on record before him, by order dated 29- 6-1998, refused the prayer under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Preemptee-petitioner then moved the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 3940 of 1998 and a Division Bench on hearing the learned Advocates of both sides and on perusal of the available materials by judgment dated 11-8-1999 discharged the Rule.<br/> <br/>5. The learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioners submits that the High Court Division committed wrong holding that the petitioners failed to make out any case for rejection of the plaint under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/> <br/>6. It is well settled that a plaint may be rejected under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure merely on a plain reading of the plaint and nothing else. It appears that the learned Subordinate Judge as well as the High Court Division considered the averments made, in the application for pre-emption and concurrently found that it disclosed cause of action and that same was not barred by any law, further more the case is at its last stage of trial before the learned Subordinate Judge. The parties have already examined witnesses and in that stage the application under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure has been filed. It has been found that there is no hard and fast rule when such an application is to be filed but ends of justice demands that it must be filed at the earliest opportunity. Though the learned Advocate for the petitioner tried strenuously to convince us that the averments made in the plaint disclosed that the miscellaneous case is barred by law but we are not convinced. The High Court Division it appears thoroughly considered the factual and legal aspect of the matter and finding that the petitioners failed to make out any case discharged the Rule. The learned Advocate for the petitioners failed to point out any legal infirmity in the judgment of the High Court Division which may call for our interference.  <br/> <br/>7. There is no merit in this petition and the same is accordingly dismissed.  <br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
