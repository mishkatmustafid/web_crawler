Ruhul Amin J:</strong>This petition for leave to appeal has been filed against the judgment of October 28, 2003 of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 5775 of 2002 making absolute the Rule obtained against the order dated September 24, 2004 (order No. 161 dated 24-9-2002) of the Court of Joint District Judge and Artha Rin Adalat No.2, Dhaka in Title Suit No. 13 of 1997 allowing an application filed under Order I, rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/> <br/>2. The suit was filed seeking the decree that the defendant No.1 is a licensee of the plaintiff in respect of the property in suit as well as for khas possession of the property described in schedule B to the plaint upon eviction of the defendant No.1. It was the case of the plaintiff that defendant No.1 was allowed to reside in the land in suit as licensee, that defendant No.1 wanted to purchase some land from the plaintiff but plaintiff having not sold land to the defendant No.1, he hatched up a plan to grab the property and that in conni­vance with certain Serajuddin brought into existence a deed in 1979 in respect of .32 acres of land, that Serajuddin had no right, title and interest in the land said to have been sold to the defendant No.1. In due course defendant No.1 entered appearance in the suit by filing written statement denying the case of the plaintiff and asserting that defendant's purchase from Serajuddin is quite legal.<br/> <br/>3. At one stage of the suit a certain Khairunnessa filed an application under Order 1, rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure with the prayer for being added as defendant in the suit contending that she has right, title and interest in the property in suit.<br/> <br/>4. The plaintiff opposed the prayer of said Khairunnessa and the Court rejected the prayer of Khairunnessa by the order dated May 2, 2002. Thereafter on September 24, 2002 the said Khairunnessa filed another applica­tion under Order 1, rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the Court allowed the same on the very day. Thereupon, the plaintiff moved the High Court Division in revisional juris­diction and obtained the Rule.<br/> <br/>5. The High Court Division while considering the materials on record noticed that against Khairunnessa whose prayer for being added as defendant was allowed upon an application filed under Order I, rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the plaintiff in the suit has not sought for any relief. The High Court Division also noticed that the learned Joint District Judge while allowing the prayer of Khairunnessa for being added as party in the category of defendant in the suit did not spell out in what way and how presence of certain Khairunnessa is necessary for adjudica­tion of the suit and that no reason has been assigned by the trial Court in allowing the application of Khairunnessa. The High Court Division was also of the view that in the petition for being added as a party Khairunnessa did not disclose how she acquired interest in the land in suit. The High Court Division has further observed that the order passed by the trial Court is not a speaking one. On the aforesaid observations and findings, the High Court Division made the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>6. The order passed by the trial Court and impugned before the High Court Division runs as follows:<br/> <br/>“Perused the documents filed by the plaintiff. Matter is reconsidered. Prayer is allowed. Let the petitioner be made defen­dants as prayed for.”<br/> <br/>7. In the suit i.e. Title Suit No.13 of 1997, declaration has been sought for that the defendant No.1 is a licensee of the plaintiff and for eviction of the defendant No.1 from the property described in schedule B. So, it is seen that the moot question in the suit in question is, whether defendant No.1 is a licensee of the plaintiff. The opposite party No.4 who was added as defendant by the trial Court upon the petition filed under Order I, rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure specifically stated that in the suit no relief has been sought for against anybody other than defendant No.1. From the materials on record it is seen that opposite party No.4 in his application for being added as the party in suit did not disclose any tangible case in support of her being a necessary or proper party in the suit for effective adjudication of the subject matter of the suit. In that state of the matter, we are of the view that the High Court Division did not commit any error in making the Rule absolute and thereupon setting aside the order of the trial Court adding the opposite party No.4 as defendant in the suit.<br/> <br/>8. In the background of the discussion made hereinabove we find no substance in the petition.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
