Rahman J:</strong>Appellant was the de­fendant in Title Suit No. 9 of 1981 of the Second Court of Subordinate Judge, Mymensingh. That suit was instituted by the respondent for specific perfor­mance of contract for sale of the suit property. By filing a written statement the appellant denied that there was any contract for the sale of the suit proper­ty with the respondent.<br/> <br/>2. The suit was fixed for hearing on 16th Feb­ruary, 1983. On that date the defendant filed an appli­cation for adjournment with a medical certificate on the ground of illness. The prayer for adjournment was, however, not granted and the suit was decreed ex-parte on that date. Thereafter on the appellant's application under Order 9, rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure, Miscellaneous Case No. 28 of 1983 was started. That case was fixed for hearing on 26th July, 1983. On the assertion of the appellant's son that his mother was ill the case was adjourned till 13-9-1983 On the adjourned date the appellant filed an application for the Court's direction to Dr. Saiful Islam, the doctor who gave the medical certificate, to appear before the Court and prove the medical certifi­cate. On the same day i.e. 13.9.1983 another appli­cation was filed for time on the ground that Dr. Sai­ful Islam, a Government employee, had net been granted leave by his employer and hence he could not come to depose before the Court. Both the applica­tions were, however, rejected. The Miscellaneous case was dismissed on 1.11.1983.<br/> <br/>3. On appeal the High Court Division refused to interfere in the matter after observing that the de­fendant did not state as to what type of illness she suffered from; and that she could not produce any ev­idence to prove her case of illness; that even her son could not say what type of illness his mother was suffering from; and that there was no sufficient cause for non-appearance of the defendant at the time of hearing of the suit.<br/> <br/>4. The learned Counsel for the appellant has challenged each of the above observations of the High Court Division. It is submitted that the appel­lant had only taken two or three adjournments and that on 13. 9. 1983 a Medical Certificate dated 12. 2. 1983 was produced in Court stating that the appel­lant was suffering from heart disease, and that the ap­pellant's application for some time for examining the doctor being rejected the appellant was denied an opportunity to prove her cause of absence on the date of hearing. It is further submitted that the learned Judges of the High Court Division erroneously held that the appellant did not state in the application what type of illness she suffered although it was cat­egorically stated in the application that she had been suffering from heart diseases for long time and it was supported by the Medical Certificate dated 12. 2. 1983.<br/> <br/>5. After considering the facts and circumstances of the case we find that there is some substance in the contentions of the learned Counsel for the appel­lant. We set aside the judgments and orders of the Courts below and allow the Miscellaneous Case No. 28 of 1983. Let Title Suit No. 9 of 1983 of the Sec­ond Court of Subordinate Judge, Mymensingh be restored to its file and number. The appellant is, however, to pay a sum of Taka 2,500/- towards the respondent's legal expenses within two months from the receipt of notice from the trial Court, failing which the appeal shall stand dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
