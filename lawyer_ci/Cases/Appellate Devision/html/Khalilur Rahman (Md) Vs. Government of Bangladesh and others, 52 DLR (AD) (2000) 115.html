The Delimitation Officer on 26-5-98 published the list of 9 wards, 3 reserved seats for women and the voter list and sent the same to the Ministry to which the petitioner filed an objection without any result. Thereafter respondent No. 2 published the impugned Gazette Notification declaring the final list of the wards showing area of each ward.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> The Rule, on contest, was discharged by the learned Judges of the High Court Division on the finding that there was no substantial difference in the arrangement of delimitation of wards and the Delimitation Officer on consideration of territorial unity, distribution of population and administrative convenience made the delimitation of the wards in question and that allegation on such variation of population cannot be resolved in a writ petition and that the petitioner was not a person aggrieved.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> Md. Nizamul Huq Nasim, learned Advocate for the petitioner, submits that the finding of the learned Judges of the High Court Division that Delimitation Officer considered territorial unity, the distribution of population and administrative convenience cannot be sustained in absence of any paper for such finding and that the impugned Notification finally published showing number of population was violative of section 21 of the Paurashava Ordinance, 1977.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> In section 21 of the Ordinance by Act No. II of 1998 the words “save with a variation of not more than 10%’ after the words “population” inserted in sub-section (1) of section 21 indicates that delimitation of wards is to be made taking into consideration territorial unity, distribution of population and administrative convenience as far as practicable and it does not speak about population only but as well as administrative convenience and territorial unity. The expression “as far as practicable” employed in section 21(1) vests in the Delimitation Officer authority to consider all the above 3 aspects viz, territorial unity, distribution of population and administrative convenience and, as such, decision by him evidently is to be based on consideration of these factual aspects.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> The learned Judges of the High Court Division rightly held that the dispute regarding variation of population cannot be resolved in a writ petition under Article 102 of the Constitution since it requires adjudication on facts and on evidence and that the petitioner is not a person aggrieved within the meaning of Article 102 of the Constitution. The finding of the learned Judges of the High Court Division that there was no substantial difference regarding variation of population is based or comparison of draft list of the Delimitation (Annexure “C”) and the final list (Annexure “E”). In the instant case the petitioner is a Chairman of the Pourashava and because of the impugned Gazette Notification relating to delimitation of wards he cannot be said to be an aggrieved person within the meaning of Article 102 of the Constitution in that by such Notification no right of his either constitutional or legal has been infringed.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> For the aforesaid reasons, we do not find any substance in the contentions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner. There is no substance in this petition.<br/> <br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></span></div></div></div>
