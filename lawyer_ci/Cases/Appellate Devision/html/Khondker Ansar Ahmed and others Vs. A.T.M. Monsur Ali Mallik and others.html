Title Suit Nos. 134 of 1964 and 984 of 1962 were filed by the plaintiff respondents in the 1st Court of Assistant Judge, Khulna for ejectment of the defendant appellants as monthly tenants from Municipal holding Nos. 13 and 12 respectively. Admittedly the suit land measuring .17 acres being C.S. Plot No. 3871 appertaining to C.S. Khatian No. 1865 of Mouza Baniakhamar originally belonged to one Rakhal Das Bose and his wife. The case of the plaintiff is that their predecessor-in-interest, Baidyanath Chatterjee purchased the suit land from the original owners in the benami of his relative Srish Chandra Bhattacharjee by a registered kabala dated 28.07.1927. Subsequently he divided the suit land into two equal parts and created two separate Municipal holding being holding No. 12 (new 23) and holding No; 13 (new (24). Baidyanath Chatterjee filed a suit being Title Suit No. 102 of 1958 in the Court of Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Khulna for a declara­tion that he purchased the suit land from the original owners in the benami of Srish Chandra Bhattacharjee who was his benamdar. On the basis of a solenama, a compro­mise decree was passed by the learned Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge) on 22.08.1958 declaring that Srish Chandra Bhattacharjee was benamdar of Baidyanath Chatterjee. Baidyanath subse­quently transferred the suit property com­prising holding Nos. 12 and 13 to the plain­tiffs by a registered kabala dated 04.11.1967. The plaintiffs brought two suits, one 984 in 1962 another 134 in 1964 for ejectment of the defendants as monthly ten­ants from holding Nos. 13 and 12 respec­tively on the ground of default in payment of rent and bonafide requirement of the owner.<br/> <br/>3. The defendants contested the suits by fil­ing written statements denying the material allegations made in the plaint. Their case, in short, is that the defendants were never the monthly tenants of the plaintiffs or of Baidyanath; that no landlord and tenant relationship existed between them and Srish Chandra Battacharjee died leaving two sons Dhirendra Bhattacharjee and Birendra Bhattacharjee. Baidyanath Chatterjee was the karmachary (employee) of Dhiren Bhattacharjee and Biren Bhattacharjee who migrated to India immediately after parti­tion of India. Dhiren and Biren Bhattacharjee settled the suit properties along with other lands of the suit plot to defendant’s predecessor-in-interest, Khondker Abdus Salam on 17.05.1950 at a rental of Tk. 30/- on receipt of a salami of Tk. 4001/- by executing an amalnama (amaldari) and that the defendants have been pos­session the suit holding since then on the basis of the aforesaid settlement. Their fur­ther case is that Dhiren and Biren Bhattacharjee agreed to complete the trans­action by executing registered documents in favour of the defendant’s predecessor-in-interest but they did not do so. They also asserted that the solenama filed in Title Suit No. 102 of 1958 was fraudulent and the plaintiffs did not acquire any interest in the suit property by virtue of the kabala dated 04.11.1961.<br/> <br/>4. The learned Assistant Judge found that Baidyanath Chattarjee was the real owner of the suit premises and Srish Chandra was benamder of Baidynath of the suit premises and the plaintiff-respondents acquired title to the same by purchase by kabala dated 04.11.1961 from Baidyanath Chatterjee. The trial court also disbelieved the case of settlement of the suit premises to defendant-appellants by Dhirendra Bhattacharjee and Birendra Bhattacharjee, two sons of Srish Chandra Bhattacharjee. The trial court accordingly decreed the plaintiff’s suit for ejectment. The defendants filed Title Appeal No. 295 of 1963 against the judg­ment and decree passed in Title Suit No.984 of 1962 and Title suit No. 134 of 1964. Title Appeal No. 295 of 1963 was allowed by the appellate court on the findings, inter alia, that the relationship of landlord and tenant was not established between the parties. The other appeal being Title Appeal No. 145 of 1965 arising out of Title Suit No. 134 of 1964 was dismissed by the appellate court upon findings, inter alia, that the plaintiffs having prima facie title to the suit property the defendants are monthly tenants in respect thereof under the plaintiffs.<br/> <br/>5. Being aggrieved by the decision in Title Appeal No. 145 of 1965, the defendants filed Civil Revision No. 1222 of 1981 while the plaintiff respondents being aggrieved by the decision in Title Appeal No. 295 of 1963 filed Second Appeal No.116 of 1979.<br/> <br/>6. The learned Single Judge of the High Court Division heard both the matters together and disposed them of by the impugned judgment. The High Court Division upon hearing passed the impugned judgment and order for which the defendant’s appellants are aggrieved and obtained leave from the same.<br/> <br/>7. Leave was granted to consider the sub­mission that the High Court Division erred in affirming the decree for ejectment of the defendants from the suit premises as month­ly tenants when there is no proof of land­lord-tenant relationship between the parties and section 109 of the Transfer of Property (Act) is also not applicable in the facts of the case and the submission that the High Court Division upon a misconstruction of Ext. 7, 8(1), 9 and 12(b) and the decree passed in Title Suit No. 102 of 1958 wrong­ly held that the defendants appellants were tenants under the plaintiff-respondents and their predecessor-in-interest, Baidyanath Chatterjee and the further submission that the High Court Division was clearly wrong in not adverting to the reasonings and findings given by the appellate court in Title Appeal No.295 of 1963 in which it was held that there was no relationship of land­lord and the tenant between the plaintiffs and the defendants and accordingly Title Suit No. 984 of 1962 was dismissed.<br/>8. We have heard Khandaker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, the learned Counsel for the appel­lants and Mr. Mahbubey Alam, the learned Counsel for the respondents and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/> <br/>9. It is not disputed that the suit property originally belonged to Rakhal Das Bose and his wife. The plaintiffs' case is that Baidyanath Chattarjee purchased the suit property in benami of his relative, Srish Chandra Bhattacharjee by kabala dated 28.07.1972 and Baidyanath Chatterjee pos­sessed the said land and constructed huts. He let out the suit premises to the defen­dants who are monthly tenants. The further case of the plaintiffs is that Baidyanath instituted Title Suit No. 102 of 1958 for a declaration that he purchased the suit prop­erty in the benami of his relative Srish Bhattacharjee who was his benamder. Dhiren and Biren sons of Srish filed solenama in the suit and a compromise decree was passed declaring Srish as benamder of Baidyanath. The further case is that by a registered kabala dated 04.11.1961 the plaintiffs purchased the suit properties at a consideration of Tk.8,000/- from Baidyanath and late Khondker Abdus salam, predecessor of defendant Nos. 1-4, was a monthly tenant in the premises at a monthly rent of Tk. 15/- under Baidyanath Chatterjee and thereafter under the plaintiffs and notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act was duly served upon the defendant-appellants.<br/> <br/>10. The case of the respondents, on the other hand, is that Srish Bhattacharjee was not a benamder of Baidyanath and he purchased the suit properties with his own money for his own benefit. On the death of Srish Bhattacharjee the property devolved upon his two sons, Dhiren Bhattacharjee and Biren Bhattacharjee who settled the same by executing an unregistered amalnama (amal-dari) in favour of defendants' predecessor-in-interest on receipt of a salami Tk. 4001/- and at a rental of Tk. 30/- on 17.05.1950. Since then they are in possession and they were never tenants under Baidyanath or the plaintiffs.<br/> <br/>11. The learned Advocate for the appellant submits that the compromise decree obtained in Title Suit No.102 of 1958 by Baidyanath against Dhiren Bhattacharjee and Biren Bhattacharjee, sons of Srish Bhattacharjee is not a transfer document and after the decree Dhiren and Biren did not execute any transfer deed in favour of Baidyanath and hence by such sole decree Baidyanath did not acquire any title to the suit property. We are unable to accept this argument of the learned Counsel as it is the definite case of Baidyanath that he pur­chased the suit land with his own money and for his benefit in the benami of his rela­tion Srish Bhattacharjee and he himself was in possession initially by residing in the suit land and thereafter he let out the same to Khandaker Abdus Salam, predecessor-on-interest of the defendants as monthly tenant. Since the sons of alleged benamder Shrish Bhattacharjee filed solenama in Title Suit No. 102 of 1958 brought by Baidyanath for a declaration that Srish Bhattacharjee is benamder and the suit having been decreed on compromise on the basis of solenama filed by Dhiren and Biren, sons of Srish Bhattacharjee, in our view, no transfer doc­ument is necessary in favour of Baidyanath by Dhiren and Biren.<br/> <br/>12.  The learned Counsel then argued that since the defendants or their predecessor were/was not parties in Title Suit No. 102 of 1958 brought by Biadyanath against Dhiren and Biren, sons of Srish Bhattacharjee, they are not bound by the sole decree passed in Suit No. 102 of 1958. It is true that the defendants or their predecessor were not parties in the suit. In our view, they were not necessary parties in the suit and as such they were not rightly made parties in the suit. He next submits that Exts. 7, 8(a), 9 and 12(b) were not properly considered by the High Court Division and upon misconstruction of those documents the High Court Division wrongly held that the defendants are tenants under the plaintiffs and their predecessor-in-interest Baidyanath. Ext.7 is the copy of the order dated 31.05.1950 passed by the House Rent Controller on a petition filed by the defendants' predecessors, Khandakar Abdus Ansar Ahmed praying for fixation of rent of house No. 12. The House Rent Controller fixed the rent at Tk. 15/- Ext. 8(a) is the copy of an order dated 09.01.1963 passed by the Assistant Settlement Officer, Khulna in Objection Case No. 808 under section 19(1) filed by the defendant Khandker Ansar Ahmed against the preparation of record of rights. It shows that record of rights was not prepared in the name of defendant’s predecessor but order was passed to record his possession in Col. 13. of the Khatian. Ext.9 is the copy of reply to the show cause filed by the second party Abdus Salam in a proceeding under section 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before Mr. S.A. Hamid, Magistrate 1st Class, Khulna on 21.03.1985. In this peti­tion he clearly stated that he came to the then Ext. Pakistan in 1950 as a refugee and has been residing in holding Nos. 12 and 13 of Ward No.4 of Khulna Municipality (now City Corporation) as monthly tenant Ext.12 (b) is the copy of deposition of Khandkar Ansar Ahmed, in the above noted proceeding under 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as second party. In his deposition he categorically stated "in 1950 we migrated to Pakistan and occupied the disputed house that’s holding No. is 12 of Ward No. IV. We also occupied holding No. 13. Dhirendra Bhattacharjee is the owner of both the holding. He lived in Calcutta. We are tenant of holding No. 12 and paid rent Ext. A series are rent receipts granted by Bidhu Bhusan who was the karmachari of Dhiren, Ext. B is the certified copy of the suit register of the House Rent Control Case for the disputed house." In his evidence he also stated "We occupied the house after set­tling rent Tk. 15/- was fixed as rent for hold­ing No. 12 from House Rent Controller in 1950. I have no paper to show the fixation of rent. Previous to the rent control case, we used to pay Tk. 18/- per month as house rent for holding No. 12. I have rent receipt for holding No. 13 which I will not file." In his evidence he further stated that he would deposit the rent of the suit premises before the House Rent controller after disposal of the pending case.<br/> <br/>13. Thus it is clear that the predecessor-in-interest of defendants and defendant Kh. Ansar Ahmed himself admitted that he was a monthly tenant in the suit premises. Therefore, in our view, the High Court Division properly considered these docu­ment viz. Ext. 7, 8(a), 9 &amp; 12(b) and there is no misconstruction of the documents.<br/> <br/>14.  Mr. Ahmed then argued that there was no proof of attornment of the defendants either in favour of Baidyanath or the plain­tiffs. Attornment is absolutely necessary in absence of a transfer by lessor. There being no transfer by Dhiren and Biren in favour of Baidyanath or plaintiffs, section 109 of the Transfer of Property Act cannot come into operation and the plaintiff's remedy lies in a regular suit for declaration of title. In reply the learned Counsel for the respondents sub­mits that this point was not raised before the High Court Division or before the courts below. Let us quote below Section 109 of the Transfer of Property Act:<br/> <br/>"<strong>109. Rights of lessor's transferee</strong>.- If the lessor transfers the property leased, or any part thereof, or any part of his inter­est therein, the transferee, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, shall possess all the rights, and, if the lessee so elects, be subject to all the liabilities of the lessor as to the property or part transferred so long as he is the owner of it; but the lessor shall not, by reason, only of such transfer, cease to be subject to any of the liabilities imposed upon him by he lease, unless the lessee elects to treat the transferee as the person liable to him: Provided that the transferee is not enti­tled to arrears of rent due before the transfer, and that, if the lessee, not hav­ing reason to believe that such transfer has been made, pays rent to the lessor, lessee shall not be liable to pay such rent over again to the transferee. The lessor, the transferee and the les­see, may determine what proportion of the premium of rent reserved by the lease is payable in respect of the part so transferred, and, in case they disagree, such determination may be made by any Court having jurisdiction to enter­tain a suit for the possession of the property leased."<br/> <br/>15. This Section provides that if the lessor transfers the property leased, the transferee acquire the right of the lessor and if the les­see so elects, the transferee shall be subject to all the liabilities of the lessor as to the property transferred. Since the plaintiffs acquired right, title and interest in the suit property through Baidyanath whose title was confirmed by sole decree passed in Title Suit No. 102 of 1958, it can not be said that the defendants are not tenants under the plaintiffs in the face of Ext.7, 8(a), 9 &amp; 12(b) and in view of our discussion made above. Hence the argument of Mr. Ahmed does not stand.<br/> <br/>16. Admittedly the suit property was Non-Agricultural Property from before 1947 and the same is situated within Khulna Municipal Corporation. The defendants once claimed that they were monthly ten­ants under Srish Bhattacharjee and there­after under his sons, Dhirendra and Birendra. They again claimed that they took settlement of the suit property by unregis­tered Amaldari from Dhirendra and Birendra on 17.05.1950. It is the settled principle of law that settlement of Non-Agricultural land within Municipality can­not be affected by unregistered document. The same must be affected by bilateral reg­istered document executed by both the les­sor and the leasee. Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949 came into force on 28th October, 1949 and according to Defendant’s case they took settlement by unregistered Amaldari on 17.05.1950 and as such the same is hit by section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act.<br/> <br/>17. Both the courts below concurrently held that notices under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act were duly served upon the defendants of the suit. The defen­dants did not set out in their pleading that they have been paying rent for the suit premises.<br/> <br/>18. Mr. Ahmed lastly argued that Title Suit No. 134 of 1964 is barred under the provi­sions of Order 2, Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. He submits that the cause of action of both the suit arose at the same time and as such the subsequent suit namely Title Suit No. 134 of 1964 is barred under the aforesaid Rules. In reply the learned Counsel for the respondent submits that the suit holdings being different, the provisions of Order 2 Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure are not applicable in the present case. The contention so made by the learned Counsel of the Respondent appears to be of merit.<br/> <br/>19. Therefore, in view of the discussions made above, we are of the view that the High Court Division upon correct assess­ment of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision. There is no cogent reason to interfere with the same.<br/> <br/>Both the appeals are, therefore, dis­missed with costs at all stages.<br/> <br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
