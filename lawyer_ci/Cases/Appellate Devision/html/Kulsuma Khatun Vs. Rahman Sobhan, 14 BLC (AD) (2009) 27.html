Joynul Abedin J</strong><br/> <br/>This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 5-7-2006 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 4334 of 1998 discharging the Rule.<br/> <br/>2. The short fact leading to the filing of the leave petition is that the suit land is origi­nally recorded as Government khas land during the time of CS operation. The suit land was sold in auction for arrear of rent in Certificate Case No. 25/20-21 on 11-9-1922 and auction-purchased by one Abala Sundari in the benami of Upendra Lal Chowdhury and Prafulla Bala Debt and got delivery of posses­sion through Court. Upendra Lai Chowdhury by registered deed dated 22-9-1922 relin­quished his claim in favour of Abala Sundari and Abala Sundari got delivery of possession on 31-5-1923. Prafulla Bala by registered kabala dated 22-9-1930 sold her share of land to Abala Sundari and delivered possession to her. RS Khatian finally stands recorded in the name of Abala Sundari. The suit land was hillock and full of jungle. Abala Sundari converted the same by expending huge amount of money. Abala Sundari while in possession made an agreement for sale with the predecessor of the plaintiffs with a consideration money of Taka 2500 and she took Taka 2000 as advance and delivered possession to plaintiffs' predecessor on 26th of Kartik, 1340 BS. After purchase the predecessor of the plaintiffs constructed kutcha and pucca houses upon the schedule land and he was in peaceful possession. After the death of their predecessor the plaintiffs are in posses­sion upon the suit schedule land and they acquired title over the same under section 54 (A) of the Transfer of Property Act. The defend­ant Nos. 2 to 14 have got no right, title, interest and possession over the suit land but they have fraudulently managed to have their names recorded in the BS khatian and now they are claiming title over the suit land. Hence the plaintiffs filed the present suit for declaration of their title.<br/> <br/>3. The defendant did not appear in the suit in spite of due notice and, as such, the learned trial Court took up the suit for <em>ex parte</em> hearing and by Order No.1 dated 23-3-1991 the trial Court decreed the suit <em>ex parte</em>. Against this <em>ex parte</em> decree, Rahman Sobhan and Farooque Sobhan filed Miscellaneous Case No. 32 of 1991 under Order IX, rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/> <br/>4. The learned Assistant Judge by order No. 46 dated 15-10-1992 dismissed the said Miscellaneous case. As against this order, the defendant Nos.1 and 2 filed Miscellaneous Appeal No. 310 of 1992 and by judgment and decree dated 23-8-1998, the learned Subordi­nate Judge, 3rd Court, Chittagong allowed the appeal on setting aside the judgment and order dated 15-10-1992 and restored Title Suit No.183 of 1990 to its original file and number. There­after the plaintiff-petitioners filed a review petition before the same Court to reconsider and set aside the judgment and order passed on 23-8-1998, which was ultimately rejected on 22-11-1998.Thereafter the plaintiff-petitioners having been aggrieved by the judgment and order dated 23-11-1998 preferred Civil Revision No. 4334 of 1998 in the High Court Division. After hearing the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division discharged the Rule. Thereafter being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division the plaintiff-petitioners filed this civil petition for leave to appeal.<br/> <br/>5. Md. Nawab Ali, the learned Advocate-on-Record for the petitioners, submits that the case of the defendant-respondent Nos.1 and 2 before the trial Court was that the sum­mons was not duly served on them and that they were not aware of the institution of the suit but they did not claim in their petition that their addresses given in the cause-title of the suit was wrong but in spite of this position the learned Subordinate Judge as well as the learned Single Judge of the High Court Divi­sion committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice in making out a third case. He lastly, sub­mits that the Single Bench of the High Court Division committed an error of law affirming the judgment and order of the appellate Court below without any legal and valid reasoning. Therefore the judgment of the High Court Division is liable to be set aside for the ends of justice.<br/> <br/>6. We have heard the learned Advocate and perused the connected papers including the impugned judgment. We do not find any substance in the points raised. The High Court Division upon correct assessment of the mate­rials on record arrived at a correct decision. We therefore find no reason to interfere with the same.<br/> <br/>The petition is accordingly, dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
