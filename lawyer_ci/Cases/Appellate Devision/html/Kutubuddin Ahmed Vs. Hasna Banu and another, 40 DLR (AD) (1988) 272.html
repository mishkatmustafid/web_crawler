Afzal J.</strong><br/> <br/> This appeal by special leave is at the instance of the defendant and arises out suit for eviction of the said defendant from the remises as a monthly tenant and realisation of arrear rent. The suit was decreed by the trial court but the decree was reversed in appeal. A learned Single Judge of the High Court Division, Rangpur Bench, by the impugned judgment and order dated 15th No­vember, 1984 passed in Second Appeal No. 138 of 1979 set aside the appellate judgment and decree and restored those of the trial court.<br/> <br/> <br/>2. Defendant then obtained leave to appeal from the judgment of the High Court Division contending that the trial court's finding that the plaintiffs are landlord of the defendant is perverse, unsupported by any evidence and that there is also no basis for the finding that the defendant paid rent to the plaintiffs' guardian, Dr. Aziz Meser Mohammad Ali in that the counter-foils of rent-receipts produced by the plain­tiffs in support of their claim contained no signature of the tenant defendant. Leave was granted to consid­er the point raised by the defendant as it appeared that complicated question of title as involved in the suit.<br/> <br/>3. Respondents who are wife and son respec­tively of Dr. Asiz Meser Mohammad Ali (P.W.1) instituted the suit being other Suit No. 13 of 1974 in the Court of Munsif, Nilphamari for the aforesaid reliefs on the averments, inter alia, that the proper­ties described in the schedule to the plaint previously belonged to Dinerdra Nath Ganguli who entered into an agreement on 11.8.19.66 with Dr. Aziz Meser Mohammad Ali for sale of the suit property. Upon execution of the said agreement the plaintiffs were delivered part possession of the suit property. There­after on 10.10.69 the plaintiffs purchased the suit property by two registered kabalas Ext. 2 and 2(ka). The defendant was a monthly tenant under the plain­tiffs' vendor in "kha" schedule premises at a rental of Tk. 20/- per month. After the purchase by plaintiffs the defendant also took monthly lease of the suit pre­mises from Dr. Aziz Meser Mohammad Ali, who acted on behalf of the plaintiffs. Defendant is a habit­ual defaulter and plaintiffs required the suit premises for their own use and occupation. They terminated the tenancy by serving notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act but the defendant did not vacate the suit premises.<br/> <br/>4. Defendant-appellant denied plaintiffs' title and possession in the suit land and further the alleged tenancy under them. His definite case was that the suit property belonged to late Surendra Nath Tarafder who inducted his son-in-low Tarapada Majumder in the suit land and he constructed pucca and semi-pucca structures on the suit plot No. 499 with Surendra-nath's permission. On the death of Surendra Nath's daughter relationship became estranged between Su­rendra Nath and Tarapada Majumder and as a result Tarapada Mujumder had to vacate the suit land. On getting back the suit property Surendra Nath leased it out to one Korban Ali Malik on monthly basis and after him to one Ahsan Ahmed. The defendant's son Md. Atiar Rahman took sub-lease of the suit premis­es from Ahsan Ahmed and started a Printing Press. Further case of the defendant is that Surendra Nath made a gift of the suit land in favour of his grandson Chitta Ranjan Tarafdar by a registered deed dated 4.8.1940 Ext. ka and thus Chitta Ranjan Tarafdar be­gan to possess the suit land. The recording of the suit land in the R.S. Record in the name of Dinendra Nath Ganguli to the extent of 3 annas and in the name of Chitta Ranjan Tarafdar to the extent of 13 annas is wrong and the entire suitland ought to have been recorded in the name of the latter, Dinendra Nath Ganguli, plaintiffs' vendor, had neither title to nor possession in the suit land.<br/> <br/>5. The learned Munsif upon a consideration of oral and documentary evidence on record found title with the plaintiffs, relationship of landlord and ten­ant between the plaintiffs and defendant, default in payment of rent from March 1970 to May 1973 and further requirement of the suit premises by the plain­tiffs for their own use of occupation. Accordingly the suit was deecreed.<br/> <br/>6. On appeal by the defendant die learned subor­dinate Judge reversed the decree upon the findings that even if the plaintiffs purchased the land from the actual owner it was not proved that they purchased the suit premises and the suit ghar, and further that the relationship of landlord and tenant had not been established between the plaintiffs and the defendant,<br/> <br/>7. The learned Judge of the High Court Divi­sion in the Second Appeal by the plaintiffs, as al­ready noticed, set aside the judgment and decree of the appellate court and restored those of the trial court upon finding that the appellate judgment was not a proper judgment of reversal in that the considerations which weighed with the learned Subordinate Judge could not be considered sufficient for reversing the findings of the learned Munsif and that the Judgment and decree of the trial court were reversed with out controverting the reasons given by the learned Munsif in support of his conclusions.<br/> <br/>8. At the hearing of the appeal, Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed, learned counsel for the appellant, firstly sought to contend that Surendra Nath Tarafdar being the C.S. recorded owner of the suit land and he hav­ing made a gift of the same to his grand-son Chitta Ranjan by a registered deed dated 4.8.1980 and 13 anna interest having been recorded in his name in the R.S. Record, the plaintiffs' vendor Dinendra Nath Ganguli had no title to the suit land which could be conveyed to the plaintiffs by kabalas Ext. 2 and 2 (ka). He also submitted that there was no reliable ev­idence to prove that the defendant was a tenant under the plaintiffs and that the finding of the Subordinate Judge in that behalf was wrongly set aside by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>9. The submission disputing the plaintiffs' title is as much belated as it is devoid of any substance. It overlooks the comprehensive findings made by the learned Munsif in that behalf which have not been reversed even by the learned Subordinate Judge. It is not disputed that Surendra Nath inducted his son-in-law Tarapada Majumder in the suit land who raised structures there, The defendant's case is that after the death of the wife of Tarapada Majumder relationship became estranged between Surendra Nath and his son-in-law Tarapada and he was evicted by Surendra Nath from the suit land and possession was taken over from him. The learned Munsif upon considering the judgment (Ext.9) in T,S.No.620 of 1935 for eviction of Tarapada Majumder and other evidence found that Surendra Nath did not act up to the decree and allowed Tarapada Majumder to continue in pos­session and thus he acquired good title to the suit land, that it was clear that the deed of gift in favour of Chitta Ranjan Tarafdar (who himself deposed as P.W.2 and denied his possession) was not acted upon and that the record in the name of Chitta Ranjan Tarafder was entirely wrong. It was also found that the disputed land and house were purchased by Sitanath, father of the plaintiffs' vendor Dinendra Nath Ganguli by registered kabala dated 24.8.1948 Ext. 2 (kha) and the plaintiffs having purchased from Dinendra Nath by kabalas Ext. 2,2(ka) there was no room for doubt about the plaintiffs' title to the suit land. The Subordinate Judge did not controvert any of these findings but upon a consideration of the schedule of the plaintiffs' kabalas came to the finding that even if it was conceded that plaintiffs purchased the land from the actual owner it was not proved that they purchased the suit premises and the suit ghar.<br/> <br/>10. It is evident from the pleading that the de­fendant himself never took the plea that the plain­tiffs' kabalas do not cover the suit land and the suit premises. Had they taken any such plea the kabala land could be relayed but since there was no dispute with regard to the suit land no relayment was done. As regards structures there is clear recital in the body of the kabalas which was noticed by the Subordinate Judge himself. Thus the finding of the Subordinate Judge was unwarranted and clearly beyond the pleading of the defendant and as far as plaintiffs' title is concerned, it is found fully established.<br/> <br/>11. As regards the existence of relationship of landlord and tenant plaintiffs, besides oral evidence, produced counter-foils of rent-receipts Ext. 12 series. The Subordinate Judge found that the said counterfoils having not been signed by the defendant could prove payment of rent. The trial Court, however, upon the said counter-foils giving some reasons for the absence of signatures of the defendant in, which were not adverted to by the Subordinate Judge. The Subordinate Judge in finding against plaintiffs did not take into consideration the de­fendent’s case at all as was done by the trial Court. Of course, ultimately in one sentence the Subordinate Judge also found that defendant's case was not proved satisfactorily. It will be seen that the defendant not claim title to himself but put up a case of sub-tenancy under one Ahsan Ahmed to whom the premises was allegedly leased out by Surendra Nath Tarafdar after evicting his son-in-law Tarapada Majumder from the suit land. The trial court found that was no evidence of possession of Surendra Nath after alleged eviction of Tarapada and the defendants in that behalf was false. There was, therefore, no occasion for Surendra Nath to lease out the suit premises to Ahsan Ahmed and for him to make sub-lease to the defendant. Defendant neither exam­ined said Ahsan Ahmed nor brought any documen­tary evidence to show that he was a tenant under him. In view of these and other circumstances and the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs, the trial Court rightly found that the defendant was a monthly ten­ant under the plaintiffs. There is thus no substance in the contention that there was no basis for the find­ing of relationship of landlord and tenant between the plaintiffs and the defendant.<br/> <br/>12. In this connection certain other observa­tions made by the Subordinate Judge require to be noticed. It has been held by him that even if it is be­lieved that defendant paid rent to P.W. 1 (Dr. Aziz Meser Mohammad Ali) in respect of the suit premis­es then a relationship of landlord and tenant was created between P.W.1 and defendant. But P.W.1 was not the plaintiff in the suit. He has also found that the notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Prop­erty Act having not been served by P.W. 1, the land­lord, it was bad in law. These observations are again beyond the pleading and amount to making out a new case for the defendant. Plaintiffs' case has been that P.W.1 acted as their agent. P.W.1, however, said in evidence that he purchased the property but the kabalas were in the name of his wife and son, Mr.M.H. Khandkar, learned counsel for the respon­dents, fittingly replied to the said observations by submitting that the suit for eviction at the instance of the wife and son of Dr. Aziz Meser Mohammad Ali in whose name the kabalas stand is in any case maintainable on the principle that a benamdar is a trustee for the beneficial owner and he represents the real and beneficial owner and as the legal title is in him he can maintain in his own name a suit for pos­session. Mr. Khandkar cited the case of <em><strong>Kumar Narendra Nath Roy V. Midnapore Zemindary Co. Ltd. </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> 70 C.L.J 218</strong></em> in support of his submis­sion. In the case of <em><strong>Chowdhri Gur Narayan and Ors. Vs. Sheo Lai Singh and ors. </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> 23 C.W.N. 521 (P.C)=461.A.1</strong></em>, the Privy Council observed that as a benamdar represents the real owner, and is so far as their relative legal position is concerned, a mere trustee for him, there is no reason why an action cannot be maintained in the name of the benamdar in respect of the property although the beneficial owner is no party to it, a proceeding by or against the be-named being in its ultimate result fully binding on the beneficial owner. Thus in any view of the matter it could not be said either that the notice under sec­tion 106 T.P. Act was bad or that the suit was not maintainable as P.W.1 was not the plaintiff.<br/> <br/>13. In view of the discussion above there ap­pears to be no substance in the contentions raised in this appeal and the same is, accordingly, dismissed with costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong> </div></div>
