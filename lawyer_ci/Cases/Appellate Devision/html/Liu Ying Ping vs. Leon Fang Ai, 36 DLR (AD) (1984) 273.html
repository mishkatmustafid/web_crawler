No. 94 of 1979.<br/> <br/>2. Leave was granted to consider the ques­tion namely upon the dissolution of the part­nership whether the immovable property can be considered as the property of the individual partner and whether such property can be partitioned and further whether a separate registered deed was necessary to convey the share of the parties in the immovable property notwithstanding the agreement of settlement. Civil Petition No. 17 of 1984 was also filed by the plaintiff respondent. Since common question of facts and law are involved both of them are disposed of by this judgment.<br/> <br/>3. Defendant is the appellant in CA. No. 112 of 1983. Respondent plaintiff filed Title Suit No. 231 of 1976 in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka 3rd Court for dissolution of partnership firm styled "Cafe China" for accounts and for partition of the suit property consisting of a plot of land and building at 75 Dilkusha Commercial Area, Dhaka. It was stated in the plaint that she and the defendant had been carrying on business as partner of a Chinese Hotel and Restaurant in the name and style "Cafe China" in a rented house at Segun Bagicha, Dhaka from 1.1.62 and subsequently a partnership deed was executed between the parties on 4.10.62 which was duly registered with the Registrar of Firm at Dhaka; that the share of the plaintiff and the defendant were 40 paisa and 60 paisa respectively and the partnership business bad-been making profit; that the firm got an allotment of a plot measuring 2638 sft at 75 Dilkusha Commercial Area from the D.I.T. and after construction of a building on the said plot the business was shifted therein and the plaintiff and defendant had been jointly possessing the suit property; that the defendant had been trying to raise a big amount of cash by mortgaging the suit property for his own benefit and on coming to know of the same the plaintiff sent a notice to the defen­dant, expressing her intention to dissolve the firm, amicably settle the account and to parti­tion the suit property to which the defendant did not agree. Hence the suit.<br/> <br/>4. Defendant contested the suit by filing a written statement contending, <em>inter alia,</em> that he was an expert and <em>bona fide</em> Caterer and was running hotel and restaurant business for a pretty long time: that at the request of the plaintiff he inducted her as a partner in the business and a deed of partnership was executed between the parties and the firm star­ted; that the plaintiff paid Tk. 4,000/- in the beginning and no further amount was paid thereafter; that in April, 1967 the plaintiff was asked to pay her proportionate share of the capital when she expressed her intention to sell out her share to the defendant: that through the mediation of the members of the Chinese community in Dhaka it was agreed and decid­ed that the plaintiff would sell her share to the defendant for a consideration of Tk. 20,000/-. It was settled that the defendant would pay Tk. 4,000/- during the month of April, 1967 and another Tk. 2,000/- during the month of June, 1967 and the remaining Tk. 14,000/-would be paid after four months from June, 1967. Accordingly a deed of agreement was executed on 16.4.1967 and thus the plaintiff sold her share in the aforesaid manner; that the defendant paid Tk. 6,000/- as per terms and also Tk. 14,000/- by a cheque on 10-8-75; that the plaintiff after selling her share duly informed the D. I. T., Registrar of Firms, I.D.B.P. and other concerned, authorities for taking necessary action follow­ing the dissolution of partnership; that in 1971 the defendant went to the then West Pakistan for treatment with the members of his family and he was stranded there and consequently the property was considered as abandoned property and on his return he applied for the release of the property from the list of the abandoned property and in fact it was so released in his favour; that the plaintiff was all along in this country but she did not get the property released and she did nothing for the partnership since the dissolu­tion in 1967 and prayed for dismissal of the suit.<br/>The trial court dismissed the suit on the finding, inter alia, that the plaintiff ceased to be a partner on and from 16th April, 1967 and since the partnership firm was dissolved from that date the suit was not maintainable.<br/> <br/>5. The plaintiff preferred the First Appeal No. 94 of 1979 before the High Court Division and by its judgment the High Court Division allowed the appeal in part decreeing the suit in preliminary form in respect of the claim of partition to the extent of 40 paisa the immovable property at 75 Dilkusha Com­mercial Area and expressed the opinion that a registered deed will be necessary for con­veying the purported share in the immovable property and dismissed the suit in respect of the other claim of the plaintiff.<br/><br/>Leave as aforesaid was granted to consider the question mentioned above and the plain­tiff's cross-petition being C. P. No. 17 of 1984 was heard analogously.<br/> <br/>6. The concurrent finding of fact of both the courts below was that the partnership firm was dissolved on and from April, 1967. Ad­mitted fact is that out of Tk. 20,000/-Tk. 6,000/- was only paid as per stipulation and the balance Tk. 14,000/- was not paid until 1975 and she has not enchased either; that the plaintiff and the defendant started a partnership firm in 1962 and continued up to 1967 is not in controversy. The controversy arises as to the nature of the agreement that was concluded on 16th April, 1967 between the parties. The agreement is Ext. 2(a). The material portions are reproduced as under:</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">"1. Mrs. Young Chung Ching agrees to withdrew and handover her share of the assets and business of China Cafe to Mr. Liu Tet-Ping at an agreed total value of Rs. 20,000/- Payable to Mrs. Young Chung Ching.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">2. A sum of Rs. 4,000/- in cash must be paid by Mr. Liu Tet-Ping to Mrs. Young Chung Ching at the end of April and at the same time a cheque for Rs. 2,000/- encashable at the end of June also be handed over to her making a clearance of a total sum of Rs. 6,000/-.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">3.

Effective from 16th April, 1967 all the profit and loss of the business credits and Loans due to and/or from China Face will have no concern with Mrs. Young Ching whatsoever.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">6. Mr. Liu Ten-Ping will advertise in the newspapers to secure customer for the sale of the house property situated at "Motijheel". The price of which will be determined and fixed by Mr. Liu Tet-Fing and whatsoever amount of profit or loss arising there from will be his own and entire responsibility. How­ever, if the sale of the house property takes place before the full settlement of the payments as mentioned   above, the sale deed can only become effective when signed jointly by Mrs. Young Chung Ching. This deed is executed in the presence of the members of our community and for the sake of friend­ship and regard for eliminating the difference of opinion between each other, the members of our community present, signed together with both the partners Mrs. Young-Chung Ching and Mr. Liu Tet-Fing. Person withdrawing the share of the partnership; Lee Fong Ai (Mrs. Young Chung Ching) signed".<br/> <br/>7. Mr. S.R. Pal appearing for the defen­dant appellant contended that the agreement has for all purposes put and end to the part­nership and by series of correspondence that the partnership has been dissolved on and from 16th April, 1967 was brought to the notice of all concerned. He referred to Ext. A, trade license, in the name of the defendant which is also Ext. F (c) dated 25.7.68 which shows that license was granted to Mr. Liu Ying Fing, defendant. Ext. D series, tax receipt shows defendant as proprietor; Ext. E Urban Tax dated 29.6.71 show defendant as assessee. Ext. F shows that the D.I.T. received full payment from the defendant; Ext. L Income Tax return from 1967 clearly shows the partnership was at an end. The assessment order is illuminating which may be quoted in full:<br/>"Dhaka Circle "G", Dhaka.<br/>18 June 1968—69.<br/>                                                                                             Cafe China,<br/>                                                                      75 Dilkusha Com­mercial Area<br/>                                                                                                   Dhaka.<br/>Returns filed for the two periods—one for the period from 1.1.67 to 30.4.67 showing income of Rs. 6,234/- and the other for the period from 1.5.67 to 31.12.67 showing income of Rs. 3,879/-. In compliance with the statutory notice u/s 23 (2) and 22(4) Mr. N. H. Peara Jahan, Advocate appeared and explained the returns. He also submitted an ap­plication stating that one of the partners has left the business, and as such, he withdrew the renewal petition.

The defendant explained that he went away in November, 1971 to West Pakistan. Before his departure he however, made an agreement with his employee for running the business on profit share basis in business. The agreement is Ext. B which is as under:<br/>"We the undersigned workers of M/s. Cafe China, 75 Dilkusha Commercial Area, Dhaka do hereby agree and abide that in absence of Proprietor Mr. L.Y. Fing is going to Karachi for treatment, we will run the restaurant as usual with the following instruction of the pro­prietor.<br/>1. That we will take proper care of the assets both moveable and immoveable.<br/>2. That none of us will go on leave till the proprietor comes back.<br/>3. That we will keep proper account of the sales and expenditure and it will be banded over to the proprietor on his return. Mr. M. A. Taher who is an accountant will occasionally come to guide us.<br/>Plaintiff herself did not claim that she ever did anything for the partnership business since its dissolution in 1267. On the other hand, the I.D.B. took notice of her unwilling­ness to take loan which was granted to the partnership firm. The letters is dated 4.10.68 (Ext. M) and reads as follows:<br/>"Sanction of a Rupee Currency loan of Rs. 2.50 lacks for setting up a residen­tial Hotel.<br/>With reference to the above we have to advise that although the loan was sanctioned to you as long back as on 15.2.67 you have not completed documen­tation and other formalities to utilize the loan until now.<br/>We understand that one of your part­ners Mrs. Le Sang is no longer interested in the project.<br/>You are, however, once again advised to complete documentation and all other formalities within 7 days from date of receipt of this letter failing which we will   presume that you are no longer interested in the Project and the loan will be withdrawn without further reference to you". <br/> <br/>9. Last nail on the coffin of the plaintiff's case was given by the Government itself when the property was released from the list of the abandoned property in favour of the defen­dant by Memo No. 1 (168) M.C/ABD-74-677 of the Ministry of Commerce dated 26th May, 1975. Thus the defendant was put into posses­sion by the Government and the plaintiff tho­ugh she was althrough in the country had not thought fit to apply either for releasing of the property from the list of the abandoned   pro­perty or for looking into the business   of the firm which she claimed had not been dissolved. The oral evidence and the documentary evi­dence clearly justified the conclusion that was reached by the trial court that the partnership firm had been dissolved with effect from 16.4.67 and this finding of fact was rightly upheld by the High Court Division in First Appeal. Such concurrent finding of fact is grounded on evi­dence and, therefore contention of the plaintiff that the partnership is still continuing is devoid of any substance.<br/> <br/>10. Mr. Maksum-Ul Hakim learned Coun­sel for the respondent argued strenuously that the dissolution of the partnership could be effec­ted on fulfilling of the terms of the dissolution and since the defendant did not pay the balance Tk.14,000/- the partnership bad not come to an end and belated attempt of the defendant for making the payment by cheque of Tk. 14,000/-shows that the partnership firm has not been dissolved. The argument is attractive but does not bear scrutiny either on fact or in law. To put it concisely there had been four period of this business: (i) from 1962 to 1967. This was the period of partnership (ii) From 16.4 67 to 11.11.71. During this period the defendant al­one ran the business as proprietor of the busi­ness. Income tax return, assessment order, tread license all lead to the  conclusion that during this period the defendant was the sole owner of this business, (iii) The next period is between December, 1971 to 1975. During this period as per agreement with the workers the business was managed on profit-share basis on behalf of the defendant. (iv) Trouble started from this period when the defendant came back to, the country and plea­ded with the Government for releasing of the abandoned property. Now the plaintiff woke up to establish her right over the property which once upon a time was partnership property but dissolved by an agreement in April, 1967. Her contention that since one of the item was not fulfilled the partnership sub­sists is bereft of any substance because it was she who by conscious act put an end to part­nership business by announcing that loan is not necessary from the IDBP since she has retired. This act was a positive hostile act to­wards the partnership business and thereby giving a burial to the whole matter. It therefore does not lie in her mouth to say that the part­nership still subsists. The opinion is that the concurrent findings of facts that the firm had stood dissolved on and from 16.4.67 need not be interfered.<br/> <br/>11. The next question whether the High-Court Division was correct in taking the view that the share of the individual partner in the immov­able property is to be conveyed only by way of registered deed'. With respect, the High Court Division has fallen into error on the question of share of interests. After dissolution of the partnership and selling of her share, how the question of individual share arises is not clear. She has already sold out her share in lieu of Tk. 20,000/-. Having done so, how again the question of her share comes in. True that she has not been paid Rs. 14,000/- for which an action lay and she can bring a money suit but that does not bring her back to partnership which stands dissol­ved. Mr. Maksum-Ul Hakim attempted to get out of this by making a submission that since one of the main stipulations was not honored it will be deemed that the partner­ship subsists and alternatively at the most she has retired. The argument involves a fallacy. Retirement of a partner from a firm and dis­solution of the firm the quire distinct and a clear distinction exists between the two con­cepts, inasmuch as the consequences flowing from each are entirely different. In the case of retirement of a partner, it is only the part­ner who goes out of the firm and the remain­ing partners continue to carry on the business of partnership as firm while, in the latter case, the firm as such no more exists and the dis­solution is between all the partners of the firm. Sections 31 to 38 (Chapter V) deal with consequences of retirement. The subject of dissolution of a firm and the consequences though are dealt with in Chapter VI (section 39 to 55). The Act does not contemplate or deal with the concept of any partial dissolu­tion or dissolution qua an individual part­ner. Section 4 defines partnership "is the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all". Section 43 deals with dissolution of Partnership. The agreement dated 16.4.67 clearly demonstrates her intention to dissolve the firm in order to bring about a dissolution. Accordingly the firm's registration was not renewed for pur­poses of income tax assessments. The Urban immovable property tax assessment was made in the name of the defendant and the trade license was obtained in his individual name. These circumstances clearly show that the firm was intended to be dissolved. Dissolu­tion may be inferred from circumstances. Mr. Hakim argued strenuously on clause 6 of the agreement and contended that the clause itself shows that dissolution was contemplated upon the happening of a certain event e.g. payment of Tk. J4, 000/- and since it has not happened the dissolution cannot be inferred. The document itself was written in Chinese language. Affidavit of Alexander Lee who translated it into English is Ext. D(6) (1) where the plaintiff was shown as the "seller of the share" and the defendant as "the pur­chaser of the share" and the clause was draf­ted in the fashion for safeguarding the interest of the plaintiff So that she may realize the amount". It is clear that the clause was inten­ded to be a safety valve for the plaintiff and they understood it in the same light but that would not salvage the partnership which has been put to an end by conscious volition of the parties on 16.4.67.<br/> <br/>12. Her only claim remains is for the sum of money, and after hearing both the sides we have been advised to do complete justice in the cause and accordingly we have treated Civil Petition for claim of money. Before we proceed further it is necessary to examine the point of registration. The High Court Division took the view that registered deed is necessary for conveying the share. We have examined this point and it will be sufficient to mention that the view cannot be upheld.<br/> <br/>13. In view of the decision in <strong><em>Narayanappa Vs. Bhaskara Krishnappa AIR 1966 (SC) 1300</em></strong>, which has disapproved the view taken in <strong><em>17 Bombay page 235</em></strong> the decision of <strong><em>20 DLR 1056</em></strong> relying on<strong><em> ILR 17 Bombay page 235</em></strong> without noticing <strong><em>AIR 1947, Lahore page 13</em></strong> is no longer good law.  <strong><em>AIR 1966 (SC) 1300</em></strong> has followed <strong><em>Ajudha Vs. Shams (AIR 1947 Lah 13</em></strong> and quoted with approval a passage of <strong>Cornelius J </strong>(as be then was) Order 21 Rule 49 C.P.C. throws light on the point. An interest of a partner is partnership assets is intended to be treated as movable property under this rule notwithstanding that at the time when it is charged or sold the assets included immovable property <strong><em>Ajudhia Vs. Sham, AIR 1947 Lah  13 FB</em></strong>. This indeed is the view which has commended itself to us, The decision in <strong><em>Fast END Agencies Vs. Mafizuddin (20 D.L.R. 1056)</em></strong> that the transfer of interest of a partner in partnership firm can be effected by a registered document under the provisions of section 17(i) (b) of the Registration Act when the firm is possessed of immovable property as the transfer operates to create an interest in an immovable property does not appear to be sound law and the same is overruled. In fine registration of such docu­ment for conveying share in partnership in immovable property is not required. The High Court Division was clearly in error on this point.<br/> <br/>14. Now come to the money claim of the plaintiff. She was not paid Tk. 14,000/- as was settled by the agreement on 16.4.67. Her claim is not barred because the defendant himself has issued the cheque for that amount in 1975 and the suit was brought in 1976 Mr. Pal in his characteristic manner submitted that since the Court is taking full view of the matter that complete justice may be done he would not raise  any technical point unnecessarily.<br/> <br/>15. Having heard Mr. Maksum-Ul Hakim, we are of the opinion that the money decree should be awarded and accordingly it is hereby decreed that the defendant will pay the plaintiff respondent Tk. 1,50,000/- (one lack fifty thousand) which is to be paid within 30 days from the date, in default interest at the rate of 15% on amount decreed will be charged till realization. In this term the C P. No. 17 of 1984 is disposed of.<br/> <br/>In the result therefore his appeal is allowed to part and the impugned part of the High Court Division judgment is set aside. There will be no order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Shahabuddin Ahmed J.</strong><br/><br/>I agree with my learned brother <strong>B. H. Chowdhury J</strong>, on the judgment proposed to be delivered; I would however add few words of my own in respect of the principal question of law involved in this case. The question is whether the interest of a partner in a partnership pro­perty, though it is in fact an immovable proper­ty, is to be treated as a movable property for the purpose of its relinquishment, adjustment or transfer on dissolution of the firm, and whether a conveyance, compulsorily registerable under section 17 of the Registration Act, is necessary for such relinquishment, adjustment or transfer of the interest.<br/> <br/>18. Respondent filed the suit for dissolution of the Partnership firm, for accounts, and also for Partition of the suit property, particularly a piece of land with a building thereon at 75, Motijheel Commercial Area. Both the trial Court and the Appellate Court concurrently found that the, partnership already stood dissolved from 16 April 1967, that the plaintiff ceased to have any connection with the firm since then and that the accounts firm were also settled the terms of which were recorded in a Deed of Settlement; the trial Court therefore dismissed the suit observing that the suit partition is not maintainable. But the Appellate Court held that since an immovable property was involved the plain­tiff's share was not relinquished to the defen­dant as instrument; as it could not be trans­ferred except by a registered instrument; the plaintiff therefore continued to have her 40-paisa share in the landed property of the firm, and on this view, decreed the suit in part. To examine the correctness of this decision leave was granted by us.<br/> <br/>19. Mr. S.R. Pal, learned Advocate for the appellant has contended that this view of the High Court Division is palpably erron­eous as the share of a partner in a partnership property is a 'movable property’ for the trans­fer of which no registered instrument is neces­sary. He has relied upon a number of decisions particularly in the cases of <strong><em>Addanki Narayan-appa Vs. Bhaskara Krishnappa, AIR 1966 SC 1300 and Ajudhia Pershad Ram Vs. Sham Sunder AIR 1947 Lan. 13</em></strong>. He has further pointed out that the decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of <strong><em>Jaharmal vs. Tejram Jagrup 17 Bom 235</em></strong> on which the Dacca High Court based its decision in the case of The<strong><em> East End Agencies Vs. Mafizuddin, 20 DLR 1056</em></strong> has been reversed by the Indian Supreme Court in the case as referred to above.<br/> <br/>20. To consider the question whether a partner's share in a partnership property is treated as movable property, it is necessary to examine the nature of a partnership pro­perty. Section 14 of the (Bangladesh) partner­ship Act 1932, when read along with the rele­vant sections, shows that it is a property which has been originally brought in by the partners when the partnership is formed and also the property which is acquired in the course of the business of the firm. This pro­perty belongs exclusively to the firm; no partner can claim, any part of the pro­perty as his own, and what a partner is entitled to is his share of profits only, so long the partnership continues and upon dis­solution of the partnership, his share is his proportion of the money representing the firm's assets after liquidation of the partner­ship debts and liabilities. The Partnership Act has been mainly based on the English Part­nership Act of 1890 and section 22 of that Act refers to 'partnership property' in the following words: <br/>"Where land or any heritable interest therein has become partnership pro­perty, it shall to be treated as between the parties...as personal or movable and not real or heritable estate." <br/>Commenting thereon Lindley in his "Part­nership" stated as follows:<br/>"From the principle that a share of a partner is nothing more than his propor­tion of the penmanship assets after they have been turned into money and appli­ed in liquidation of the partnership debts, it necessarily follows that, in equity, a share in a partnership, whether its property consists of land or not, must, as between the real and personal representatives of a deceased partner, <u>be deemed to be personal and not real estate.</u> (The underline is mine).<br/> <br/>21. As to our Partnership Act, 1932, section 15 declares that the property of the firm shall be held and used by the partners exclusively for the purpose of the partnership business This necessarily precludes any partner from laying claim upon any separate portion of the property as his own. Section 29 provides for transfer of a partner's inter­est, but such transfer does not entitle the trans­feree, during the continuance of the firm, to interfere in the conduct of the firm's busi­ness or to require accounts of the firm but entitles him only to receive the share of profit of his transferor, and on dissolu­tion of the firm, the transferee is entitled to receive the share of the assets of the firm to which the transferor part­ner was entitled. Section 32 provides for retirement of a partner from the partner­ship but it makes no provision for the separation of the share of the retired partner but this matter has been left to be determined by agreement between the partners. In the case of <strong><em>Ajudhia Pershad (AIR 1947 Lah.)</em></strong>  <strong>Cornelius J.</strong> elaborately discussed this provision of the law held: <br/>"There would thus appear to be no doubt that the share of a partner in an existing partnership is essentially, mov­able property, notwithstanding that a part of the partnership property may be immovable." <br/> <br/>22. This view of <strong>Cornelius J.</strong> found fav­our with the Indian Supreme Court while considering the question in the case of Addanki Narayanappa as referred to above. Facts of that case are quite similar to that of the instant case. In the Indian case, members of two joint Hindu Families—Addanki fami­ly and Bhaskara family—entered into a part­nership business of rice-hulling Subse­quently, Addanki family retired by an Agree­ment and relinquished their share in the part­nership assets including immovable properties in favour of the Bhaskara family and the terms of the settlement were recorded in a document styled "Karar". It was not a regis­tered Document. Subsequently, the Addanki family filed a suit against the Bhaskara family for dissolution of the partnership and for accounts contending that the partnership assets included immovable properties and the Karar which recorded the relinquishment of their interest In those assets was compulsorily register able under section 17(1) (3) of the Registration Act, but as it was not registered the document was inadmissible in evidence to prove to dissolution of the partnership and settlement of accounts. This contention was rejected, the suit was dismissed and it was held that "the interest of the partners of Addanki family in the partnership assets was movable property and the document evidenc­ing the relinquishment of that interest was not compulsorily register able under S. 17(1) of the Registration Act.<br/> <br/>23. In the instant case, the respondent by the agreement Ext. 2(a), with her partner retired from the partnership and relinquished ail her interests including her share in the land and building at Motijheel on considera­tion of cash payment of Tk. 20,000/00. This document was not required to be registered under the Registration Act. Consequently, her interest in the land and building stood transferred to the appellant who thereupon converted all his assets into a proprietorship and mutated his name accordingly in all rele­vant public documents. The decision of the High Court Division in respect of this point is erroneous since a partner's share in a partnership is a movable property under the Partnership Act. But the greater part of the consideration—Tk. 1400/00—was not paid. For realization of this amount the respondent should not be derived to a fresh litigation. This amount was due by July, 1967 when its real value was at least seven times that at present and had this money been paid then the respondent could have utilized it in profitable business or in acquisition of landed property elsewhere. Mr. Paul also sees the logic of this point and be is not opposed to a decree from this Court for a reasonable amount. In the circumstances a money decree for Tk. one lack fifty thousand is quite reasona­ble.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
