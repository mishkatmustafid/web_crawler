From the materials produced before us it is fully established that there was no arbitrariness whatsoever on the part of the banks in filling up the posts which were made from the waiting list as referred by the learned Counsel for the respondents. Since the advertised vacancies had been filled up according to merit and following the quota system, therefore, selection process in that respect stood exhausted. The waiting list does not survive. Moreover, in absence of any statutory provision one year can be considered as reasonable period for validly of a waiting list. Since the validity of the select panel has come to an end of the affix of time, therefore, there cannot be any order to appoint the persons from such select list prepared about 4/5 years ago. The writ petitioner-respondents have not acquired any enforceable right to be appointed. It is settled principle that a mandamus may issue to compel the authorities to do something, it must be shown that the statute imposes a legal authority and the aggrieved party had a legal right under the statute or rule to enforce it. This classical position continues and a mandamus could not be issued in favour of the writ petitioners directing the Banks to appoint the writ petitioners since they failed to establish that they have acquired an enforceable legal right to be appointed in the Banks since their names were empanelled and that the Banks have legal duty to appoint them. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span>. . .

Results of MCQ and written examinations were duly published. A total number of 2655 candidates for the posts of Senior Officers, and 1414 candidates for the posts of Officers, were passed in the MCQ and written examinations. The Viva Voce tests were held from 17.01.2014 to 29.01.2014 for the posts of Senior Officers and from 13.12.2013 to 15.12.2013 for the posts of Officers. Final result of the candidates, who passed in the viva voce test, was published officially on 03.07.2014. A total number of 401 candidates were selected for recruitment in the posts of Senior Officers and a waiting list was prepared. Similarly, a total number of 501 candidates were selected for recruitment in the posts of Officers and a waiting list was prepared. On 21.09.2015, a circular was issued under the signature of the Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Finance, forming a 17 members Bankers Selection Committee (shortly, the BSC) for appointment of Officers (1st and 2<sup>nd</sup> Class) of State owned Commercial Banks, Specialized Banks and Financial Institutions. Member Secretary of the BSC issued a letter communicated under memo No.weGmwmGm-103/2015-11 ZvwiL 03/11/2015 addressing the Managing Director, Rupali Bank informing him about the resolution of the 1<sup>st</sup> meeting, held on 28.10.2015, of the BSC for recruitment in the posts of Senior Officers and Officers. The writ petitioners tried to know about the fate of empanelled candidates but the Bank authority did not publish their names/roll numbers despite repeated requests. The Bank for unknown reasons delayed recruitment from the said waiting list inasmuch as writ petitioners are supposed to be recruited in those posts according to their position in the merit list. The Bank, by not taking any step for the recruitment of the writ petitioners, frustrated their legitimate expectation causing immense sufferings to the writ petitioners. News has been published in different electronic and print media that about seven thousand candidates have been depriving from the opportunity of being appointed for the decision of the Finance Ministry. The writ petitioners including other candidates of Sonali Bank, Janata Bank and Rupali Bank filed applications to the Government for their appointments but without giving any attention to their right and legitimate expectation to be appointed, the writ respondent No.3, Member Secretary of the BSC published the impugned job circulars. Thereby, the writ respondents violated the writ petitionersâ fundamental right guaranteed under articles 27 and 29 of the Constitution and frustrated their legitimate expectation to be appointed in those posts. Thus, they filed the aforesaid writ petition and obtained Rule.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The Rupali Bank contested the Rule, by filing an affidavit-in-opposition and a supple-mentary affidavit-in-opposition contending that the BSC is a Committee that has been formed to prepare a panel for holding examination, scrutinization and selection of the candidates for the purpose of appointments in the posts of 1st and 2nd Class Officers in the nationalized banks and financial institutions.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">5.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">It is stated that earlier Rupali Bank issued an employment notification inviting applications from competent candidates for recruitment in the posts of Senior Officers and Officers.

The writ petitioners applied for the above mentioned post and got admit cards for sitting in MCQ test and written examination. The MCQ test, written examination and Viva Voce tests were held duly. Thereafter, final results of the qualified candidates were published on 08.06.2015 for the post of AEO and on 27.08.2015 for post of AEOTeller. Of them, 189 candidates were selected for appointment in the post of AEO and other 583 candidates were kept in the Panel for future recruitment. For the post of AEO-Teller, more than 1883 candidates were found successful in the Viva Voce test. Among them, initially 497 candidates were selected for appointment and 1386 candidates were kept in the waiting list. Thereafter, 10 more were recruited in the post of AEO on 05.08.2015 from waiting list in order of their merit. Thereafter, again one on 18.10.2015 and 12 on 24.11.2015 were recruited for the post of AEO. A panel of 570 candidates was prepared. The writ petitioners further contended that there is established practice of appointments from empanelled candidates. But a new committee namely the âBankers Selection Committeeâ (the BSC) was formed by the Ministry of Finance (Bank and Financial Institution Division) on 21.09.2015 for recruitment of 1st and 2nd Class Officers in the State owned banks and other financial institutions replacing the old âBankers Recruitment Councilâ(BRC). The Member Secretary of the BSC have published the impugned circulars being Circular Nos.16/2016 and 17/2016 in various dailies on 24.03.2016 and 25.03.2016 for recruitment to the posts of AEO and AEO-Teller without appointing the successfully passed and eligible candidates from the existing panels prepared in 2015.

The posts falling vacant due to not joining of respective selectees or leaving the job for any reason would be fulfilled from the panel against the quotas of the same candidates. Likewise 497 candidates were directly appointed in the post of AEO-Teller and a list of panel consisting 1386 candidates were prepared for future appointment against those who would fail to join by 29.02.2016 from the same quota. Waiting list was prepared to fulfill the posts falling vacant due to not joining or otherwise leaving the job from among the panel. Specific validity period of penal was fixed on 31.12.2015 for the post of AEO and 29.02.2016 for the post of AEO-Teller. Within the said period if any post is lying or falling vacant in the posts of AEO and AEO-Teller the same should be filled up from among the panel strictly maintaining quota system. It was never decided to give appointment to all candidates from the panel list. Some of the posts as mentioned have been filled up against those who did not join the job even after receipt of appointment letters. In the meantime, some more posts i.e. 302 in the posts of AEO and 417 in the posts of AEO-Teller had fallen vacant. Human Resource Development Department of Janata Bank with a view to fill up the vacant posts, wrote a letter to the MD and CEO of the Bank for filling up the vacant posts of AEO &amp; AEO-Teller from the existing panel list by obtaining permission from the Ministry of Finance. The Board of Directors of the Bank approved the proposal for appointment subject to prior permission from the Ministry of Finance. But the Ministry of Finance vide its letter dated 24.05.2015 refused to give permission for appointment from the existing panel. It has been made binding upon the banks to obtain clearance from the Ministry of Finance in case of any appointment of manpower vide letter dated 17.12.2009. The Chairman of the respondent Bank had no independent power to give appointment in any post of Janata Bank without prior clearance of the Ministry of Finance. Since the Ministry had already refused approval for appointment in the posts of AEO &amp; AEO-Teller to meet urgent manpower requirement of the bank from among the existing AEO &amp; AEO-Teller panel list which was recommended by the Board of Directors of Janata Bank, as such, the Chairman was unable to exercise any power regarding appointment in any post of this bank.

The Ministry of Finance, by letter dated 30.09.2014, supplied a verified list (Annexure-4), in which, name of said Haji Md. Khalil Uddin father of Nurun Nahar appeared.

The examination is for the purpose of showing that a particular candidate is eligible for consideration. The selection for appointment comes later.

Waiting list is operative only for the contingency that any of the selected candidates does not join then the candidate from the said list may be pushed up and be appointed in the vacancy so caused or if there is some extreme exigency the appointing authority may pick up in order of merit therefrom.

There must be a judicially enforceable right as well as a legally protected right before one suffering a grievance can ask for a mandamus. The one higher in rank is deemed to be more meritorious than the one who is lower in rank. It could never be said that one who tops the list is equal in merit to the one who is at the bottom of the list. Each one of the listed candidates stands on a separate level of competence as compared with another.

It can at the most be one of the grounds which may give rise to judicial review but the granting of relief is very much limited. Unless a legal obligation exists, there cannot be any legitimate expectation. Where the expectations are based upon some statement or undertaking by or on behalf of the public authority, a person having no enforceable right but affected or likely to be affected by an action of the public authority, may approach a court of law for appropriate relief. Mr. Islam failed to show any statement or undertaking that the Bank authorities assured the writ petitioners that they would be appointed since their names are in the waiting list. Mere advertisement is not a promise to appoint. The same is an invitation to fairly complete with all similarly situated persons who think that fulfill particular eligibility criteria. The doctrine does not give scope to claim relief straightway from the appointing authority as no crystallized right as such is involved. It is relevant here to refer decision of Chanchal Goyal V.
