This case of the plaintiff, in short, is that Radha Ramon Saha was the original owner of the suit land. He died leaving behind son Bagobath and wife Kiron Bala. His another son Ranjit Saha met a civil death when his father was alive. Bagobath Saha died unmarried. Thus Kiron Bala became absolute owner of the property. She gifted the property in favour of Progati Sangasad. The Sangad on 02.03.1978 sold the land under schedule on 2 to plaintiff No.1<br/><br/>3. The defendant Nos.3-6 contested the suit by filing written statement denying the material allegations made in the plaint. Their case is that Radha Ramon Saha and others the S.A. recorded tenants left this country for India during India Pakistani war in 1965. Thereafter the property was entered into the census list at serial Nos.12 and 15 as enemy property and subse­quently said property was duly and cor­rectly recorded in the R.S. record as the vested property.<br/><br/>4. The trial Court dismissed the suit. On appeal being Title Appeal No. 2 of 2001 the appellate Court also dismissed the appeal. The High Court Division after hearing the parties summarily rejected the application as aforesaid.<br/><br/>5. We have heard Mr. Mohammad Nawab Ali, the learned Advocate-on-Record for the petitioner and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other con­nected papers.<br/><br/>6. The High Court Division summarily rejected the application holding that Kiron Bala after dated of her husband got the property in life interest and therefore she had no saleable interest in the land. The transfer of the land by her in favour of the Progati Sang shad by way of gift was thus illegal and void. Thus it appears the High Court Division enunciated the correct position of law. Accordingly High Court Division did not commit any illegality.<br/><br/>7.  In view of the discussion made above, we are of the view that the High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision.<br/><br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
