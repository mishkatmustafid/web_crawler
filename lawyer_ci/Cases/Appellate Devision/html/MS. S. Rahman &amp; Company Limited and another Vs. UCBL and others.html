Abdul Matin. -</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 11.01.2004 passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No.2727 of 2000 making the Rule absolute preferred against judgment and order dated 21.01.1996 passed by the Artha Rin Adalat, First Court, Chittagong in Mortgage Suit No.33 of 1991 for removing errors of the final decree not done in accordance with the preliminary decree.<br/><br/>2. The facts, in short, are that the respondents and the United  Commercial Bank  Limited preferred the above Writ Petition No.2727 of 2000 under Article 102 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh before the High Court Division and on hearing on the 21st day of May, 2000 the High Court Division was pleased to issue Rule Nisi calling upon the respondents petitioner to show cause as to why the impugned order dated 21.01.1996 (Annexed as Annexure-A to the Writ Petition No.2727 of 2000) passed by the respondent No.1 shall not be declared to have been passed without lawful authority and is of no legal effect and or such other or further order or orders passed as to the High Court Division may seem fit and proper. The High Court Division was also pleased to stay further proceedings of Mortgage Suit No.33 of 1991 pending before the Artha Rin Adalat, Chittagong.<br/><br/>3. In the meantime the petitioner appeared in the above matter (Writ Petition No.2727 of 2000) by filing power through their respective lawyer and ultimately on 11.01.2004 by judgment and order passed by another Division Bench the Rule issued was made absolute.<br/><br/>4. The writ petitioner respondent filed Mortgage Suit No.33 of 1991 in the Court of learned1st Artha Rin Adalat, Chittagong against the petitioner and others for realization of Tk.73,63,612.50 which was subsequently made an amount of Tk.67,90,120.06 as per banks subsequent account statement submitted and a preliminary decree was passed on condition for re-accounting and re-calculation of simple interest at the rate of 18% per annum with specific direction that the amount ascertained on such re- calculation and after adjustment of payment made by the petitioner to the respondent during pendency of the said matter the petitioner shall pay rest of the amount (if any) within one year in different installments enjoying waver of interest during the pendency of the Mortgage Suit No.33 of 1991.<br/>Thereafter the writ petitioner respondent on practicing-fraud upon the court and also suppressing the terms, conditions and observations of the preliminary decree regarding re-calculation of interest and adjustment of the payment made by the petitioner during pendency of the Mortgage suit obtained the final decree dated 23.10.1994 contrary to the provisions provided in the preliminary decree dated 29.11.1992.<br/><br/>5. After obtaining the above final decree on practicing fraud respondent filed Mortgage Decree Execution Case No.44 of 1994 in the same court for an amount of Tk.1,31,69,877.30 and started the proceeding for auction sale of the mortgage property in spite of the petitioners repayment of a total sum of amount Tk.70 lacs to the respondent duly authenticated (certified) by court against the decreetal amount Tk.67,90,120.66 subject to re­calculation of simple interest @ 18% per annum. The amount ascertained after re­calculation is payable within one year.<br/>In addition to above suffering of the petitioner company during pendency of the above Mortgage Suit, Mortgage Decree Execution Case and also the Miscellaneous<br/>Appeal before the High Court Division the respondent bank on colourable exercise of administrative power prejudiced the petitioner company by way of imposing embargo on their normal trade with other schedule bank through Credit Information Bureau (CIB) report of Bangladesh Bank suspending all Bank facilities of the petitioner company although they are not responsible for the abnormal delay apart from substantial payment made by the petitioner company. Copy of the letter of Janata Bank stating the embargo on trading and transaction of normal activity with other banks through Credit Information Bureau of Bangladesh Bank was also annexed with the application made before the High Court Division.<br/><br/>6.  Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the ex-parte final decree and also due to the illegal claim of Tk.1,31,69,377.06   by Mortgage Decree Execution Case No.44 of 1994 the petitioner for ensuring justice by way of legal rectification of errors committed in the final decree  and  also Mortgage Decree Execution Case due to practice of fraud upon the writ petitioner Bank, the petitioner company preferred a petition under Sections 151/152 of the Code of Civil Procedure praying for setting aside the final decree and also staying   the execution proceeding and on hearing both the parties Artha Rin Adalat passed the order (impugned order dated 21.01.1996) setting aside the final decree dated 23.10.1994 and also directed the   writ petitioner Bank to submit a current statement on the recalculation of interest @ 18% per annum in the light of preliminary decree by 27.02.1996.<br/><br/>7. The writ petitioner respondent Bank being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the above order dated 21.01.1996 preferred Miscellaneous Appeal No.30 of 1996 before the High Court Division and also for the order of stay.<br/>Ultimately the High Court Division by the judgment dated 12th December, 1999 passed in the above Miscellaneous Appeal No.30 of 1996 dismissed the said Miscellaneous Appeal being not maintainable in law.<br/>Thereafter the respondent Bank filed the writ petition and by the impugned judgment the High Court Division made the Rule absolute and set aside the judgment and order passed by the Artha Rin Adalat setting aside the final decree.<br/>As against the judgment of the High Court Division the petitioners have filed this petition for leave to appeal.<br/><br/>8. Heard the learned Counsel and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/><br/>9. It appears that after a final decree was passed against the petitioners they had specific remedy under the law but instead they filed a petition under Sections 151/152 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the trial court wrongly allowed the same and the High Court Division has rightly set aside that order and rightly held that   the petitioners had no remedy under Sections 151/152 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The High Court Division has rightly found that the respondent No.1 acted without jurisdiction in passing the impugned order allowing the prayer for setting aside the final decree under Sections 151/152 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/><br/>10. We find that the High Court Division has rightly decided the point in issue and committed no error of law or procedure. Section 151 cannot be invoked when specific provision is there in Code of Civil Procedure or any other law against the decree and Section 152 is only meant for correcting arithmetical errors or clerical mistakes and was wrongly invoked in this case by the trial court which has; been rightly corrected by the High Court Division.<br/>We find no substance in this petition which is accordingly dismissed.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
