The trial Court decreed the suit.<br/> <br/>2. The appellant's suit for partition being Par­tition Suit No. 34 of 1974 of the 3rd Court of Sub­ordinate Judge, Comilla, filed on 23.2.72, was based on the averments, <em>inter alia</em>, that the appellant's fa­ther Raj Kumar and the father of defendant-respondent Nos. 1 and 2 Surya Kumar were brothers. They took joint settlement of the suit land, a tiny town property at Comilla, in 1934 and started living there together after erecting huts as monthly tenants of the land. Raj Kumar died in 1939. The landlords filed Title Suit No. 170 of 1940 in the 3rd Court of Munsif, Comilla for arrear rent and eviction against Surya Kumar and the heirs of Raj Kumar including the appellant. The landlords did not press the claim for eviction and were satisfied with a decree for rent only on 5.9.50. It was further averred by the plain­tiff-appellant in his plaint that both the plaintiff and the defendants had no title to the suit land on the date of filing of the said suit for eviction. But after the decree they continued to occupy and possess the suit land as tenants. The appellant in course of time be­came full 8-anna owner of the suit land upon the successive deaths of the other heirs of Raj Kumar. The appellant's mother shifted to her brother's house at Shimulia about 12 years back and died there. The appellant worked and lived elsewhere at Comilla town, but continued to occupy a kerosene tin shed in the suit land which yielded to decay about 9 or 10 years back. The appellant wanted to marry and raise a new hut on the suit land only to be obstructed by his uncle on the plea that the suit land had been recorded in his name. The matter was referred to the adjudica­tion of the Union Committee but Surya Kumar would have none of it. The appellant has since mar­ried and had been living with his wife at Comilla town elsewhere. Surya Kumar died in April, 1971 and his heirs, the defendant-respondents, went to Kachar following crackdown of Pak Army in 1971. The appellant also made good his escape to Tripura in 1971. In January, 1972 the appellant came back and occupied the disputed homestead where he is living now with his family members. The R.S. Khatian has been wrongly prepared in the name of Surya Kumar. He demands 8 as. share of the suit land by partition of the joint family homestead by metes and bounds.<br/> <br/>3. Defendant-respondent Nos. 1 and 2 filed a joint written statement contesting the suit. They contend that the appellant has no right, title and in­terest in the suit land. Surya Kumar alone obtained settlement of the suit land from the landlord. Raj Kumar did not erect any hut in the suit land. He died in the house of one Monohar Mistry in 1346 B.S. The appellant's mother died at Shimulia 16 or 17 years back and thereafter the appellant lived at Laksham and elsewhere. The disputed huts are not in ejmali and the appellant has not acquired any interest in the disputed property. The defendants are in pos­session of the disputed property by inheritance from their father who had exclusive interest and title in the same. Since 1943 it is the father of the defendants who had been paying rents and taxes.<br/> <br/>4. It is the concurrent finding of both the Courts below and the High Court Division that neither the plaintiff-appellant nor the defendant-respondents could prove by any documentary evi­dence that either Raj Kumar or Surya Kumar or both had obtained any settlement of the suit land from the landlord. The trial Court held that the plaintiff-appellant proved title by adverse possession and un­der the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act. Taking the view that the appellant was a co-sharer in the suit land the suit was decreed by the learned Subordinate Judge, 3rd Court, Comilla by his judgment and de­cree dated 29.4.74.<br/> <br/>5. On appeal the learned Additional District Judge, Comilla by his judgment and decree dated 23.3.79 passed in Title Appeal No. 156 of 1974 re­versed the judgment and decree of the trial Court on the finding that the record of rights stands in the name of Surya Kumar and admittedly the appellant had no title to the suit land when the suit for evic­tion was filed in 1940 and, further, no documentary evidence being there that the tenancy right of the appellant's predecessor was perfected under the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act the suit for simple parti­tion was not maintainable without a prayer for dec­laration of title to the suit land. The appellant has no <em>prima facie</em> title to the suit land and no legal posses­sion therein within 12 years from the date of filing of the suit on 23.2.72. The plaintiffs document Ext. 1, certified copy of assessment register of 1938-39, and the isolated piece of union tax receipt are also not connected with the suit property. By judgment and decree dated 23.3.79 the lower appellant Court allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit.<br/> <br/>6. In Second Appeal No. 44 of 1980 the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division noticed both the Courts below took cognizance of the appellant's statement in the plaint that till 1940 the appellant could not acquire any valid title to the dis­puted property. The learned Single Judge held that in the face of this admission the trial Court was obvi­ously wrong in holding that if any title accrued to Raj Kumar that might have been by way of adverse possession and under the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, ignoring that Raj Kumar had already died in 1939. The lower appellate Court's finding that the suit was not maintainable without declaration of title to the suit land was upheld and the appeal was dismissed by the judgment and decree dated 9.2.84.<br/> <br/>7. Leave was granted to the plaintiff-appellant to consider whether the findings of the lower appel­late Court as maintained by the High Court Division arc based on misinterpretation of documents, Exts. 1-4 including rent receipt, assessment register and the plaint and decree of Title Suit No. 170 of 1940; whether in view of operation of section 7 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949 a non-ejectable right of tenancy was conferred upon the appellant as a non-agricultural tenant when the landlord decided not to take possession and was satisfied only with a rent decree; whether the payment of rents by the ap­pellant's predecessor, dismissed by the High Court Division as documents not creating any title, is an unchallenged evidence of the appellant's possession, especially when these are the basis of the trial Court's decision on adverse possession and when the trial Court's finding on adverse possession is undis­turbed by the lower appellate Court and the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>8. Mr. Mahmudul Islam, learned Counsel for the plaintiff-appellant, submits that there has been a total non-consideration of Exts. 3 and 4, certified copies of the plaint and decree in Title Suit No. 170 of 1940 both by the lower appellate Court and the High Court Division. Both the two Courts misread the statement of the appellant in the plaint that upto 1940 he and his predecessors had acquired no title to the suit land. The said two Courts also did not con­sider the appellant's evidence on continued posses­sion from the creation of the tenancy in 1934 up to at least 1959. Exts. 1 and 2 have not been properly considered by the said two Courts.<br/> <br/>9. Mr. M. Nurullah, the learned counsel for the defendant-respondents, submits, on the other hand, that Exts. 3 and 4 did not confer the status of non-agricultural tenant upon the appellant. The lower ap­pellate Court has fully discussed the evidence on possession and found the appellant and the other heirs of Raj Kumar not possessing the suit land at least 12 years before the institution of the suit. Exts. 1 and 2 were also noticed and dealt with by the lower appellate Court.<br/> <br/>10. The landlords who filed the suit for evic­tion in 1940 stated in the plaint Ext. 3 that the two brothers Raj Kumar and Surya Kumar obtained monthly tenancy of the suit land from Baisakh 1341 B.S. on a monthly rent of Tk. 2.50. The tenancy, therefore, started in 1934. The suit for eviction was filed in 1940. The decree, however, was passed on 5.9.50. The landlords did not press the prayer for khas possession of the suit land. The suit was de­creed for Tk. 22.50 being rent of the suit land from Sravana to Chaitra of 1346 B.S. at the rate of Tk. 2.50 per month.<br/> <br/>11. This decree, Mr. Mahmudul Islam sub­mits, brings the appellant within the ambit and pro­tection of section 7(2) of the Non-Agricultural Te­nancy Act, 1949, which is as follows:<br/><br/>"<strong>7</strong>. <em>Incidents of certain Tenancies. — Not­withstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any con­tract.<br/>(1)......................................................<br/>(2) If the non-agricultural land comprised in any tenancy which has been or is created after the commencement of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, (IV of 1982), has been held for a per­iod of not less than twelve years without any lease in writing, or<br/>(3)......................................................<br/>(4)......................................................<br/>(5)......................................................<br/>(a).......................................................<br/>(n)......................................................<br/>then—<br/>(i) the tenant holding the non-agricultural land comprised in such tenancy shall not be ejected by his landlord from such land except on the ground that he has used such land in a man­ner which renders it unfit for use for any of the purposes specified in section 4;<br/>(ii)...............................................................<br/>and<br/>(iii)…………………………………………………………</em>……………..<br/> <br/>12. Mr. Islam submits that the plaint of Title Suit No. 170 of 1940 Ext. 3 unmistakably shows that the suit land was settled in 1934 not with Surya Kumar alone but with both the brothers and in 1940 when the suit for rent and eviction was filed the heirs of Raj Kumar were found to be in joint possession of the suit land and hence they were made defendants by the landlord. The decree was obtained in 1950, but the appellant's possession will be treated to be continuous from 1934 to 1950 in view of section 88 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949 which is as follows:<br/><br/>"<strong>88. Application of the provisions of the Act to all pending suits, appeals and proceedings and unexecuted decrees, for ejectment. —</strong><em> The pro­visions of this Act shall apply to all suits, ap­peals and proceedings including proceedings in execution for the ejectment of a non-agricultural tenant which are pending at the date of the com­mencement of this Act and also to all decrees passed for the ejectment of a non-agricultural tenant which have not been executed and are not barred by limitation and in respect of which no proceedings in execution are so pending, and the tenants against whom such suits, appeals or proceedings are so pending or such decrees have been passed shall not be liable to be ejected on any grounds except under the provisions of this Act."</em><br/> <br/>13. This submission of Mr. Islam need not de­tain us for long. The father of the appellant Raj Ku­mar admittedly died in 1939. The interest of monthly tenancy did not devolve upon the heirs of Raj Kumar after his death in 1939. The definition of non-agricultural tenancy in the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949 contained in section 2(5) is as follows:<br/><br/>"<strong>2. </strong>(5)<em> Non-agricultural tenant means a per­son who holds non-agricultural land under another person with consent of that person and is, or but for a special contract would be, liable to pay rent to such person for that land and also in­cludes the successors-in-interest of the former but does not include any person who holds any such land on 'which any premises occupied by such person are situated if such premises have been erected, or are owned by the person to whom such occupier is or but for a special con­tract would be, liable to pay rent for such occu­pation ;<br/>Explanation. —In this clause "premises" mean any building such as a house, manufacto­ry, warehouse, stable, shop or hut whether con­structed of masonry, bricks, concrete, wood, mud, metal or any other material whatsoever and includes any land appertaining to such build­ing."</em><br/> <br/>14. The said definition will apply prospectively so as to include the successors-in-interest of ten­ants. When the appellant's father died in 1939, no existing law conferred the status of tenants upon the successors-in-interest of tenants. Even the Bengal Act No. IX of 1940 did not do so. If the appellant and the other heirs of Raj Kumar continued to occu­py the suit land after Raj Kumar's death in 1939, they could only be treated as trespassers, not as tenants. That is why the landlords sued them for eviction as trespassers. The protection of section 88 is not available to the appellant because on the date of coming into force of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949 the appellant was not holding any land as a tenant. Nor is the benefit of section 7(2) available to the appellant because the non-agricultural land which he was holding since 1939 was not 'comprised in any tenancy'. The question of counting 12 years from 1934 does not arise at all. With the death of Raj Kumar in 1939 his successors-in-interest became simply trespassers.<br/> <br/>15. Mr. Mahmudul Islam has made much of the observations of the lower appellate Court and the High Court Division to the effect that the appellant admitted in the plaint lack of acquisition of title upto 1940. The appellant averred that no non-agricultural tenancy right was acquired by both the plaintiff and the defendants when the suit for eviction was filed in 1940. The omission to notice the full statements in the plaint is not material, because the appellant's ad­mission in the plaint, although meant to be applica­ble to both the plaintiff and the defendants, is never­theless a correct statement insofar as the appellant is concerned, because he had never acquired the status of a non-agricultural tenant after 1939. After 1939 he remained a trespasser all throughout.<br/> <br/>16. Mr. Islam has strenuously argued that by accepting a decree for rent the appellant has been ad­mitted as a tenant by the landlords. This submission is also not correct. As already noticed, the decree in Title Suit. No. 170 of 1940, Ext. 4, was for Tk. 22'50 being rent for the months of Sravana to Chaitra, 1346, B.S. at the rate of Tk. 2'50. The decree was not passed for any rent after 1346 B.S. i.e. after 1939, when Raj Kumar died. Factually the appellant was not recognised as a tenant even in 1950 when the decree was passed.<br/> <br/>17. Ext. 1, the certified copy of assessment register of 1938-39, is not connected with the suit property in any manner and Ext. 2, municipal receipt showing payment of rent on 4.4.69 for 1967-68 when the appellant was admittedly not in posses­sion, is also of no' use to the appellant. The lower appellate Court has duly considered these two exhib­its and the appellant's contention that these two ex­hibits were not considered by the lower appellate Court is not correct.<br/> <br/>18. The appellant never prayed for partition on the basis that he or his predecessor acquired title to the suit property by adverse possession. Title by adverse possession has to be specifically pleaded and proved. The appellant's case was one of acquisition of title by settlement. The trial Court found that the case of settlement has not been proved, but it con­ferred' title on the appellant on a gratuitous finding of adverse possession in his favour, unwarranted by pleadings. This gratuitous conferment of title was uncalled for in a suit for partition where the plain­tiff’s claim of title is to be looked into incidentally. If the precise title to which he lays his claim is not supported by the evidence on record, the Court can­not find out another source of title for the plaintiff by way of gratuitous relief.<br/> <br/>19. Hence on all counts we find that the im­pugned judgment does not merit any interference.<br/> <br/>The appeal is dismissed with costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>
