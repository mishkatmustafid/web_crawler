Short facts as placed before the High Court Division are that the opposite party challenged the impugned judgment and order dated 28.9.2005 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, 3rd Court, Chittagong in Civil Revision No. 2 of 2005 affirming the order dated 30.9.2004 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 1st Court, Chittagong in Other Execution Case No. 20 of 2003. The opposite party No.1 as plaintiff obtained a decree in Other Class Suit  No. 101 of 1989 for declaration of title  in schedule-1 of the property and decree for khas possession in report of the property number 2(Ka)-2(Cha) of the schedule of the plaint against the oppo­site party Nos.2-13. In the plaint of the suit the present petitioner was not a party and the alleged dispossession is said to have taken place in 1989 and the suit was transferred and renumbered as Other Class Suit No. 22 of 1992.<br/><br/>3. The trial Court decreed the suit and on appeal judgment was affirmed and thereafter the Execution Case No. 3 of 1997 was filed and it was numbered as Other Execution Case No. 20 of 2003 in the Court of Joint District Judge, 1st Court, Chittagong and the said execu­tion case was disposed of on full satis­faction after delivery of possession as per report of the bailiff order dated 12.7.2003.<br/><br/>4.  The petitioner in the meantime filed Other Suit No. 153 of 1999 for partition in the Court of Joint District Judge, 3rd Court, Chittagong and in the said suit upon wrong instruction filed an applica­tion for injunction against the opposite party decree holder and the said applica­tion was rejected and the petitioner filed F.M.A. No. 82 of 2002 and the same was rejected also. Thereafter, the execu­tion case was carried out with respect to land covered by schedule 2(Ka)-2(cha) and the execution case was disposed of on full satisfaction by the order dated 12.7.2004 and on 1.8.2004 an applica­tion was filed for vacating the order dated 12.7.2004 whereby execution case was disposed of earlier and for amend­ment of the execution case by adding the above petitioner as a judgment debtor and also for amendment of the schedule by incorporating 2(cha) being a new property for execution. The learned exe­cuting Court by order dated 30.9.2004 vacated the order dated 12.7.2004 and added the present petitioner as a judgment debtor and also incorporated new property for execution and passed order for issue of process for possession against the petitioner.<br/><br/>5.  As against this order the petitioner filed Civil Revision No.2 of 2005 before the learned Additional District Judge, 3rd Court, Chittagong and the sane was rejected by the order dated 28.9.2005.<br/><br/>6. The High Court Division upon hear­ing the parties made the Rule absolute.<br/><br/>7.  We have heard Mr. A.K.M. Nazrul Islam, the learned Counsel for the peti­tioner and Mr. M. A. Quiyyum, the learned Counsel for the respondents and perused the impugned judgment of the High Court Division and other connect­ed papers on record.<br/><br/>8.  It appears that the connected execu­tion case was disposed of on full satis­faction on 12.7.2004 after delivery of possession as per report of the bailiff by order dated 12.7.2003. The present peti­tioner was neither a party nor a judg­ment debtor in the suit and in the execu­tion proceeding and there was no such schedule 2(chap) in the earlier suit. The High Court Division interfered on the ground that the executing Court acted beyond jurisdiction in allowing the amendment of the execution petition when the execution case was already disposed of as noticed earlier and in the meantime the opposite party No.1 had already filed Title Suit No. 24 of 2002 where allegations of trespass was made against the present petitioner during pendency of the execution case.<br/><br/>9. Considering this aspect of the matter the High Court Division made the Rule absolute.<br/><br/>10. In the facts and circumstances of the case and in view of the discussion made above, we are of the view that the High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision.<br/><br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>
