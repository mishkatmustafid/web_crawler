Plaintiff is the appellant. He filed S.C.C. Suit No. 4 of 1978 in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Second Court and S.C C Judge, Subject, against the respondent for their eviction from the suit premises. His case was that defendant respondent was a monthly tenant at Tk. 30 /- payable accor­ding to English calendar month within the 7th day of the month following next. There was an agreement between the parties. The agreement prohibited defendant No. 1 from sub-letting the premises. His case was that the defendant was a defaulter and by subjecting he was in breach of the agreement.<br/><br/>3. Defendant contested the suit that he did not sub-let the premises but was carrying on partnership business with defen­dant No. 2 since 1974. The defendant paid rent regularly, but the plaintiff refused to accept rent. So he sent rent for the month of September and October 1977 by money order which was received by the plaintiff and further remitted be rent for the mouth of November 1977 by Money Order dated 6.12.77. This money order was, however, no accepted by the plaintiff and it was returned to the defendant on 19.12.77 with the endorsement "refused 12.12.77''. So the defendant started the Rent Control Case No. 211 of 1977 and started depositing rent under sec­tion 19 (1) of the Rent Control Ordinance. The contention of the defended is that be was neither a defaulter nor had he committed any breach of agreement by sub­letting the premises.<br/>The S.C.C. Judge, Sylhet, however, came to the conclusion that the defendant was &amp; defaulter and he had sublet the premises. Accordingly, the suit was decreed.<br/><br/>4. On revision before the High Court Di­vision the learned Judge took the view that the plaintiff accepted rent on earlier occasions beyond 7th day of the month, following and thus waived clause-I of the agreement dated 29.12.70. As such be could not be termed as a defaulter. Reliance was placed on the decision of <em><strong>Shamsuddin Ahmed</strong></em>, reported in <em><strong>(1979), 31 D.L.R (AD) 155</strong></em>. Next as to the sub-letting, the learned Single Judge came to the conclusion that in the absence of any positive evidence, that defendant No. 1 had left the suit premise or any part thereof and the defendant No. 2 was in possession, there could not be any inference as to alleged sub­letting merely on the basis of the vague sta­tement made by P.W. 3 in his evidence.".<br/><br/>5. Next the learned Single Judge took the view that the agreement itself is void <em><img src="file:///C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image002.gif" style="height:16px; width:16px"/>ab initio</em> under section 23 of the Contract Act. It was observed; "Admittedly it was stipulated in the agreement (<em>Vide</em> clause-3) that the tenant would have to pay Municipal taxes including toe arrear Municipal taxes, if any, for the suit premises. Such claim even is evidently prohibited by section 10 of the aforesaid Ordinance and the said consideration of the agreement being thus forbidden by law the agree­ment was void ab-initio under section 23 of the Contract Act. This con­clusion is fully supported by the decision referred to above "(<em><strong>31 DLR (AD) 155</strong></em>).<br/>In this view of the matter, the judgment of the S.C.C Judge was set aside said the rule, was made absolute.<br/><br/>6. Leave was granted to consider the question; (a) whether the landlord waived the agreement by accepting the rent beyond the time period, (b) whether the sub-letting was not prove, (c) whether the agreement itself is void, since it contained, a clause that the Municipal tax for the premises would be payable by the tenant.<br/><br/>7. Mr. M. H. Khondker, learned Counsel, appearing for the plaintiff appellant, argued that so far as the points in clauses (a) and (b) referred to above are concerned they are questions of face and the finding of facts ought not to have been disturbed by the revisional court. In other word, whether the tenant and sub-let the premises and was a defaulter are finding of facts. As for the third point, namely, whether the agreement is void Mr. Khondker argued that the lea­rned Single Judge erred in law in holding so.<br/><br/>8. The trial court had found that the tenant was a defaulter the revisional court came to the finding that even if it was so, it was waived by the owner namely, the plaintiff. Waiver is a mixed ques­tion of law and fact. In this case, we have not found any evidence to justify such conclu­sion that there had been waiver. However in an appropriate case this point may need further consideration. But for the disposal of this appeal two more important points need scrutiny especially on section 10 inasmuch as the entire judgment revision such founda­tion of interpretation of section 10 of the Act and section 23 of the Contract Act. As for sub-letting the trial court recorded the finding that the defendant had admitted the breach by sub letting the premises to defendant No. 2 be it noted that the agreement between the plaintiff and the tenant it dated 29.12.70 and the defendant set up the case of his partner­ship with defendant No. 2 by agreement dated 26.7.74. Tenancy was terminated on 1.1.78. Since the defendant had set up a case of plantain it was upon him to prove this fact. The plaintiff, on the other hand, had given evidence, namely, by P.W. 3 whose evi­dence was accepted on this point by the trial judge, but the revisional court did not ac­cept Ms evidence, inasmuch as, "defendant No. 1 had ant left the premises inducting de­fendant No. 2." In this view of the matter, it was observed:<br/>"There could not be any inference as to allege sub-letting merely on the basis of the vague statement made by P.W. 3 in his evidence."<br/><br/>9. With respect, the reasoning in rather difficult to follow. The evidence of P.W.3 is that defendant No. 1 had sub-let the pre­mises to defendant No. 2. This evidence was accepted by the trial court. But somehow by a curious, process of reasoning the High Court Division did not accept his evidence on the ground that defendant No. 1 is still in possession along with defendant No. 2. It is nobody's class that in a sub-letting both the parties cannot stay in the same premises. In this view of the matter, we have no hesitation in saying that the contention of Mr. Khondker is correct that the learned Single Judge erred in law in reversing the judgment of the S.C C. Court. Lastly, the most important question, namely, whether the agreement itself is void on blessing hit by section 23 of the Contract Act which requires consideration because on such finding a curious position appears to emerge. If the agreement itself is void <em>ab initio</em> as the learned Judge found then what is the status of the tenant? The plaintiff brought the suit for his eviction and the defendant tenant, on such finding, appears to be a rank outsider and consequently the suit has to be decreed.<br/><br/>10. The learned Single Judge took the view that the contract is hit by section 10 of the Premises Rent Control Ordinance inasmuch as, it contains stipulation, namely, clause 3 that the tenant paid the Municipal taxes which is prohibited by section 10 of the Ordinance and therefore, the consideration of the agree­ment was illegal and as such the agreement was void <em>ab-initio</em> under section 23 of the Contract Act.<br/><br/>11. Section 10 of the Premises Rent Control Ordinance is in the flowing terms:<br/>''Premium, salami or fine not to be clai­med, received or asked for abidance or more than one month's rent not to be claimed or received. No person shall in consideration of the rent, renewal or continuance of a tenancy of any premise,—<br/>(a) claim, receive or invite plaintiff or ask for the payment of any premium, salami, fine or any ether like sum in addition to the rent, or<br/>(b) except with the previous written consent of the Controller, claim or receive the payment of any sum exceeding one month's rent of such premises as rent in advance."<br/>But it is preceded by section 9 which is as follow:<br/>"Increase on account of payment of taxes, where any municipal rate, tax, toll or fee or a share of such rate, tax, toll or fee in respect of any premises, is payable by the tenant and the land-lord agrees, under the terms of the tenancy, to pay such rate, tax, told or fee or such share of such rate tax, toll or fee, the amount so agreed to be paid by the land­lord shall be payable by the tenant to the landlord in addition to the standard rent."<br/>A plain reading of section 9 shows that by mutual agreement Municipal rate or tax is ne­gotiable. It is payable either by the tenant or by the landlord. Whatever is agreed to between the parties that can be a term of the tenancy sod if it is paid by the landlord then the amount will be reimbursed by the tenant as per agreement in addition to the standard rent.<br/><br/>12. Section 13 makes it obligatory for the landlord to give a written receipt of the payment of rent. Rule 6 of the Premises Rent Control Rules 1964 prescribed the form. In the form of rent receipt column-5 shows the details of payment and item (b) reads 'municipal rate, tax, told or fee". In the te­nant's plaintiff again column-5 (b) read "municipal rate, tax, toll or fee" and column-4(b) reads—"amount payable by tenant on account of Municipal rate, tax. toll or fee".<br/><br/>13. The previous law in 1956 (Act 16 of 1953) section 9 reads as under:<br/>"Where the landlord pays any municipal rates, taxes or cases in respect of any premises, he may apply to the Control­ler to increase the standard rent to the extent of the increase in the amount for the time bung payable by the land­lord in respect of such rates, taxes or cases over the amount paid in the period of assessment which included the first date of December, 1941."<br/><br/>14. The difference between 1953 and 1963 enactment is this that in 1953 landlord could pay the Municipal tax and he could ask the Controller to increase the standard rent. In 1963 it is the case of either way, the land­lord can pay it and the tenant is obliged to reimburse if it is the term of the tenancy, alt­ernatively, it is payable by the tenant. Hence the position although is this that the payment of Municipal rate and tax can be subject matter of the terms of the tenancy and if it so forms part of the agreement, such agreement can never be void because the law has not made ii an unlawful bargain. Section 23 of the Contract Act provides:<br/>"The consideration or object of an agreement is lawful, unless it is forbidden by law or is of such a nature that if permitted it would defeat the provisions of any law; or is fraudulent or Involves or implies injury to the persons or prope­rty of another, or the Court regards it as immoral, or opposed to public policy."<br/>The High Court Division took exception to the agreement by holding that since it cont­ains a stipulation in clause 3 that the tenant shall pay the municipal tax the agreement is void ab-initio under section 23 of the Act. It is unfortunate that the learned Single Judge did not carefully peruse the provision of the Premise Rent Control Ordinance and specially section 9 read with section 13 and rule 6 and the prescribed form. Section 23 opens up by saving that the consideration by an agreement is lawful unless it is forbidden by law. The entire Rent Control Ordinance does not show any provision which has for­bidden the payment of municipal tax by the tenant. On the contrary section 9 has clearly made it a term of the tenancy thereby mak­ing it a lawful consideration. Next whether section 10 has prohibited it. Section 10 merely prohibits the premium, salami etc. and acceptance of rent exceeding month's rent in advocate without written consent of the Controller. Further could it be said such "consideration is of a nature that if permitted it would defeat the provision of law." When section 9 expressly sanctions such consideration an implied prohibition cannot be read into the words of section 10 to bring a consideration within the ambit "of such a nature that if permitted it would defeat the provision of any law." Whenever law makes anything illegal it expressly says so and whenever it prohibits anything the provision is expressly defined. No such pro­hibition exists in the matter of the payment of municipal rate or tax. On the contrary section 9 authorises is to be a part of the bargain. In this view of the matter, there is no hesi­tation in saying that the provisions of sec­tion 10 have no manner of application.<br/><br/>15. The learned Judge referred to the decision of these Courts in <em><strong>Shamsuddin Ahmed vs. Mohd. Hassan and others </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> 31 DLR (AD) 155. </strong></em>The facts of that case are clearly distinguishable. In that case the agr­eement was created for 2 years at a monthly rent of Tk. 1600/- and the agreement mentio­ned payment of an advance of Tk. 19,200/- out of which an amount of Tk. 800/- will be deducted every month towards payment of rent so as to adjust the advance amount. This clause was found to be in violation of section 10 and hit by section 23 of the Contract Act. Since the facts are entirely different we will refrain from dealing with that case any further.<br/><br/>16. In <em><strong>Mst. Esarunnessa Bibi vs. Md. Amir Hossain </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> 38 D.L.R. (AD)</strong></em> <em><strong>1</strong></em>. It was held that the Municipal tax paid by the tenant in the absence of any contract is adjustable against the rent. Tenant was the occupier of the premises and in the face of the distress warrant for recovery of arrear municipal taxes, he paid the taxes and the subsequent transferee could not claim the arrear of rent due from the tenant which have been adjusted against the reel before the transfer. It was observed:<br/>"The payment of arrear tax which was paid to the credit of the previous owner is adjustable, if the application is made before the Controller at the option of the tenant when the Controller will be obliged so order the adjustment of any sum so paid or deposited in any other manner."<br/>In this view of the matter, there is no hesi­tation in saying that the learned Single Judge had fallen into an error of law and as such the judgment needs to be set aside.<br/>In the result, therefore, this appeal is allowed. The judgment and older of the High Court Division are set aside and those of the trial court are restored. There will be no or­der as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
