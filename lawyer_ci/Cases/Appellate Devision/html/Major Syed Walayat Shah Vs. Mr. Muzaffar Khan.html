The appellant, who is claimant displac­ed person, was allotted a half portion of this house in 1948 and the two respondents occu­pied the other portion thereof. Both parties applied for transfer of the house, the appellant filed a C.H. form and the respondents filed a N.C.H. Form.<br/><br/>3. The Deputy Settlement Commissioner by his order dated the 21st of October,   1959, held that the house was indivisible and he ac­cordingly transferred the entire house to the appellant and rejected the application of the respondents.<br/><br/>4. The respondents thereupon approached the Deputy Settlement Commissioner for a re­view of his previous order, and the successor Deputy Settlement Commissioner, without having obtained the prior permission of the Additional Settlement Commissioner as it was then necessary, by his order dated the 13th of August, 1960, interfered with the order of his predecessor dated the 21st of October, 1959 and divided the house on the basis of the pos­session of the two parties.<br/><br/>5. The appellant appealed but the learned Additional Settlement Commissioner by his order dated the 16th of February, 1961, dis­missed the appeal and maintained the impugn­ed order of the Deputy Settlement Commis­sioner dated the 13th August, 1960, without taking any notice of the appellant's objection that the aforesaid Deputy Settlement Commis­sioner had no jurisdiction to review the order of his predecessor.<br/><br/>6. The appellant went up in revision be­fore the learned Settlement Commissioner and the same was allowed. The impugned order of the successor Deputy Settlement Commissioner dated the 13th of August, 1960 was set aside and the entire bungalow was transferred to the appellant.<br/><br/>7. This time the respondents felt aggrieved and they applied to the Chief Settlement Com­missioner in second revision but their applica­tion was dismissed, on the ground that no second revision lay under section 7 of Ordi­nance No. XIII of 1962 unless the record had been already summoned under the old law be­fore its amendment on 13-1-1962 by Ordinance No. II of 1962.<br/><br/>8. The respondents then filed a writ peti­tion in the High Court of West Pakistan. This was accepted by the Division  Bench  of  the High Court on the 3rd June, 1965, and the case was remanded to the  Additional Settlement Commissioner for a fresh  decision on  certain points in the appeal filed  before him  by  the appellant.<br/><br/>9. The learned Judge of the High Court had, <em>inter alia</em>, held that the Additional Settle­ment Commissioner had failed to consider the objection of the appellant with regard to the jurisdiction of the said successor, Deputy Settlement Commissioner reviewing the order of his predecessor. The dispute relating to the status of the respondents as "displaced persons” had also, in the opinion of the High Court, not been correctly examined by the Settlement Commissioner. This too, needed fresh determination. The High Court also required a decision on the question whether the respondents, even if they are held to be locals,  are entitled to a portion of the house, if the same be found to be capable of division and the di­vided part be valued at less than  Rs. 10,000/-.<br/><br/>10. Leave was granted in this case to consider whether the High Court had rightly interfered in this case with findings of the Settle­ment Authorities on questions of the fact in its writ jurisdiction.<br/><br/>11. On behalf of the appellant it has been contended before us that in the absence of any appeal or revision from the original order of the Deputy Settlement   Commissioner dated the 21st October, 1959, the order became final and it could not have been re-opened or re­viewed by the successor Deputy Settlement Commissioner, particularly when he had not obtained the prior permission of the Additional Settlement Commissioner to review the order. It has been further contended that the order of the Additional Settlement Commissioner dated the 16th of February, 1961, maintaining the order of the Deputy Settlement Commissioner dated the 13th August, 1960, is also equally illegal.<br/><br/>12. These contentions have found favour with the learned judges of the High Court, and these appear to be the main ground upon which the case has been remanded to the Ad­ditional Settlement Commissioner.<br/><br/>13. So far as the first ground is concerned, it is a question of law relating to the jurisdic­tion of the successor Deputy Settlement Com­missioner to review his order. If he had exer­cised a jurisdiction, he did not possess the High Court was quite competent to quash it and all successive orders based upon it. On this ground alone the writ petition was bound to succeed.                                   <br/><br/>14. Now coming to the next contention raised on behalf of the appellant, namely, that the Settlement Commissioner having already found that both the respondents were born in territory now forming part of Pakistan and were, as such, not "displaced persons", it was a finding of fact based upon evidence and the learned judges of the High Court had exceed­ed their jurisdiction in setting aside this find­ing and ordering a remand on this point.<br/><br/>15. We do not wish to go into details on this question lest anything we say might pre­judice one party or the other at the hearing of the appeal before the Additional   Settlement Commissioner. Suffice it to say that the crite­rion adopted by the Settlement Commissioner in determining the question whether the res­pondents were “displaced persons" is not sup­ported by law. As to who is or who is not a "displaced persons" within  the meaning of section 2(3) of the Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1958 (XXVII of 1958) has since been fully discussed in a number of judgments of the High Court of West Pakistan, Lahore. We need mention here three of them.                                           <br/><br/>16. In the case of <em><strong>Mahboob Elahi vs. Chief Settlement Commissioner, Pakistan, PLR 1963 Lah. 214</strong></em> a Division Bench of the Court held, <em>inter alia</em>, that having regard to the purpose of the Act.<br/>(b) "A person who, though an origi­nal resident of a place which on Partition of British India fell to the share of Pakis­tan, was residing at the time of that Parti­tion at a place which fell to the share of India and had no immediate desire of leaving the place but had not made it his permanent abode would be a displaced person for the purposes of the Act.<br/>(c) A person who originally did busi­ness at two places and on Partition of British India, one such place fell to the share of Pakistan and the other to that of India, such person would  be a dis­placed person for the purposes of the Act if at the time when Partition  of British India took place in August 1947 he had to leave  the place where he was at that time doing business and he  would  have continued to do business if he had  not to leave it because it fell to the share of India.<br/><br/>17. In the case of <em><strong>Mrs. Keays Byrae vs. The Settlement Commissioner, Rawalpindi, PLD 1963 Lah. 88</strong></em> another Division Bench of the same Court obs­erved that before a person can come under the first part of the definition of the term "displa­ced person" it must be shown that the perma­nent or quasi-permanent place of his residence was in any area now forming part of or occu­pied by India Both these cases came up for consideration on a reference by a learned Sin­gle Judge of the Court in the case of <em><strong>Syed Hider Shah Vs. Mukhtar Hussain Shah and oth­ers PLD 1963 (WP) Lah, 548</strong></em> before a Full Bench of the High Court.<br/>The reference required interpretation of the term "displaced person" used in section 2, clause (3) of the Displaced Persons (Compensa­tion and Rehabilitation) Act (XXVIII of 1958).<br/>The Full Bench held that in keeping with the dictionary meaning of the word ''residence" and also the object and intent of the Legisla­ture under the Act a person in order to qualify himself as 'displaced person' must have had a permanent residence or such continuous habi­tation in that part of British India which now forms India with no immediate intention of leaving the same but for the reason given in the definition of the term displaced person. The Court proceeded to  observe that in the case of  persons   who   have their  permanent residences in that part of British India which now forms part of Pakistan, it would be a question of fact to be decided in the circums­tances and light of each case whether the resi­dence of these persons in that part of British India which now forms  part of Pakistan it would be a question of fact to be decided in the circumstances and light of each case whe­ther the residence of these persons in that part of British India which now forms part of India was of such a character and nature that they would not have abandoned the same but for the civil disturbances or the  fear of  such disturbances in that area. The Court also held that there was no contradistinction in the interpre­tation put by the learned Judges in the two cases, namely, <em><strong>Mahboob Elahi and others </strong></em>and that of <em><strong>Mrs. Keays Byrne.</strong></em><br/><br/>18. It is pertinent to mention here that this Court refused partition (No. 77 of 1963) for special leave to appeal from the order in the case of <em><strong>Mrs. Keays Byrne</strong></em> and thereby ap­proved the opinion of the learned Judges of the High Court in regard to the ingredients that are necessary to establish whether a person is or is not a displaced person within the meaning of the aforesaid Act. In our opinion, the aforesaid Full Bench case has clearly explained the meaning of the word “displaced person”  as contained in section 2, clause (3) of the said Act.<br/><br/>19. Neither the definition of "displaced person'' as given in the said Act nor the aforesaid judgments of the High Court of West Pa­kistan support the view that mere birth of a person within a place now included in Pakistan is the sole test for  determining whether a person is a "displaced person". Even the finding of fact was, therefore, based upon irrelevant considerations and was rightly set aside by the High Court.<br/><br/>20. We, accordingly, think that no reason­able ground has been made out to induce us to interfere with the impugned order of the High Court.<br/>The appeal is accordingly, dismissed but having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case we make no order as to costs;<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
