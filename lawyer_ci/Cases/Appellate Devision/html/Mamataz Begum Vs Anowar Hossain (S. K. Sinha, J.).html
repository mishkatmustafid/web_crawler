A presumption of consummation is raised from the retirement of the husband and wife, i.e. there should be no third person at the place and that the place should not be a public one, like a public bath, public road, a mosque etc. Where there has been prolonged and continuous cohabitation as husband and wife, in the absence of direct proof a presumption arises that there was a valid marriage. The law permits no specific ceremony for the contractual performance of a marriage: and no religions rites are necessary for contracting a valid marriage. There are even opinions that a marriage may be constituted without any ceremonial and even in the absence of direct proof, indirect proof might suffice. The High Court Division, in the premises, erred in holding that mere living together as husband and wife did not bring it within the bound of marriage. Apart from acknowledgment by either party, if there is continual cohabitation between a man and woman as husband and wife, there is presumptive marriage and legitimacy provided that the parties were not prohibited from intermarrying.</span></p><p class="MSGENFONTSTYLENAMETEMPLATEROLENUMBERMSGENFONTSTYLENAMEBYROLETEXT30" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 10.8pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; tab-stops: 167.75pt; background: transparent;"><span style="color: black;">The High Court Division based its decision on piecemeal consideration of Mulla’s Mohammedan Law and arrived at a decision which is not supported by any of the authors of Mohammedan Law.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">     </span>....

She claimed that though their marriage was solemnized according to Mohammedan Law, the Kabinnama was not registered. They lived as husband and wife together for a considerable time and the marriage was duly consummated. With the passage of time the respondent became more greedy and started demanding dowry from her and at one stage the respondent drove her away from his house. Respondent con-tested the suit denying the marriage and claimed that the appellant’s brother was an employee under him. He misappropriated a sum of taka thirty five thousand from his shop and to divert the said incident, the appellant instituted the suit by making wild allegations. Besides the evidence of the appellant, the Family Court on assessment of the evidence of Shadrul Islam (P.W.2), Madu Mia<br clear="all" style="page-break-before: always;"/>(P.W.3), Swapan (P.W.4) and Babul Mia (P.W.5) came to the definite finding that the respondent married the appellant and that they lived as husband and wife, and 3decreed the suit. The Court of appeal below affirmed the judgment. A single Bench of the High Court Division in exercise of revisional jurisdiction reversed the judgments of the courts below and dismissed the suit.</span></p><p class="MSGENFONTSTYLENAMETEMPLATEROLENUMBERMSGENFONTSTYLENAMEBYROLETEXT20" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 13.2pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.85pt; background: transparent; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="color: black;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">2.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="color: black;">It has been observed by the Family Court that the appellant examined independent witnesses who stated in unequivocal terms that there was marriage between the appellant and the respondent, that they lived together as husband and wife and that the respondent examined nearest relations who are not reliable witnesses. The Family Court inferred adverse presumption against the respondent on the reasonings that though the respondent denied the marriage, he being the eldest among seven siblings, the marriage of his two younger brothers is not unnatural but considering the surrounding facts coupl with the nature of the witnesses examined by him led to the inference that there was legal marriage between the appellant and the respondent. The Court of appeal below also evaluated the evidence on record afresh and arrived at the conclusion that the respondent failed to prove by adducing reliable evidence that he did not lead conjugal life with the appellant, that despite that there was no kabinnama, they lived as husband and wife which had been satisfactorily proved by the appellant by examining independent witnesses and that the Family Court was perfectly justified in decreeing the suit. The High Court Division held that in the absence of a registered kabinnama a special onus is cast upon the appellant to prove the fact about marriage, that there is no material to show that the marriage between the parties was solemnized after fulfillment of requirements laid down in paragraph 252 of the Mohammedan Law, that the appellant having failed to prove the marriage by examining competent witnesses her claim of marriage falls to the ground and that mere living together did not bring her within the bounds of marriage.</span></p><p class="MSGENFONTSTYLENAMETEMPLATEROLENUMBERMSGENFONTSTYLENAMEBYROLETEXT20" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 13.2pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.85pt; background: transparent; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="color: black;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="color: black;">Leave was granted to consider on three points, as to (1) whether non-registration of the marriage under Mohammedan Law makes the marriage illegal or irregular or non-existent, (2) whether continuous co-habitation by the appellant and the respondent over a period of three years as husband and wife coupled with their conduct infer a presumption as to the legal marriage, and (3) whether the High Court Division is justified in interfering with the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the Courts below on proper assessment of the evidence on record as to the solemnization of a legal marriage between the appellant and the respondent in exercise of revisional jurisdiction. Dr. Rabia Bhuiyan, learned counsel contended that the view of the High Court Division in drawing adverse presumption against the appellant merely on the ground of absence of kabinnama is based on misconception of law. According to the learned counsel, in view of the concurrent findings that the appellant and the respondent had lived together as husband and wife over a period of three years which suggested the presumption of legal marriage, the High Court Division erred in law in interfering with the said concurrent findings of fact.</span></p><p class="MSGENFONTSTYLENAMETEMPLATEROLENUMBERMSGENFONTSTYLENAMEBYROLETEXT20" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 13.2pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.1pt; background: transparent;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="color: black;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="color: black;">The courts below on a thorough sifting of the evidence on record came to a definite conclusion that the marriage was consummated. The High Court Division did not at all repel the findings arrived at by the courts below on the point of consummation of marriage. The High Court Division did not dislodge the findings of the courts below that the appellant and the respondent lived jointly for a considerable time as husband and wife but dismissed the suit mainly on the ground of the absence of registered kabinnama, and on the face of denial by the respondent, the appellant was required to prove solemnisation of marriage after observance of the requirements of paragraph 252 of the Mohammedan Law, the basic essentials of marriage, which she failed to prove by adducing reliable evidence. The High Court Division, however, believed the appellant’s claim that they lived together as husband and wife but castigated such living as unethical observing “Now-a-days the obnoxious alien culture of living together has made its in-road into our society and this slowly is spreading its tentacles undermining our social value and the institution of marriage”. It seems to me that the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division has failed to address the point in dispute between the parties in the light of the evidence and the principles of law applicable in the facts of the given case.</span></p><p class="MSGENFONTSTYLENAMETEMPLATEROLENUMBERMSGENFONTSTYLENAMEBYROLETEXT20" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 13.2pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.35pt; background: transparent; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="color: black;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">5.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="color: black;">Let us consider the concept of marriage under Mohammedan Law. Marriage under the Mohammedan Law is a civil contract requiring no ceremony or special formality. In Harvard Law Review, XXVII, 387 an article appears on ‘Requisites and Proof of Common Law Marriages’ explaining the concept of the common law marriage. F.B. Tyabji in his Mohammedan Law at page 101 said, the principles stated in the article may be helpful in the decision of similar questions arising under Mohammedan Law. The article reads thus: “From early times, it has not always been clear what acts were necessary to the validity of a marriage. According to early civil law the consent of the parties was sufficient; but it seems doubtful, whether under the early English common law a marriage without a minister was valid. In this country, however, many States have adopted the view that a marriage may be valid even without a ceremony before third parties. The rule is usually stated to be that an agreement to be married henceforth, followed by cohabitation, constitutes the so-called common law marriage. But both on principle and authority, it would seem that the agreement alone is sufficient to consummate a common law marriage, and that the subsequent cohabitation is important only as evidence of the agreement.” “Moreover, it is clear on the authorities, in the States where formal solemnization is not necessary, that although there is no proof of an actual written or oral contract, the agreement necessary to the formation of a common-law marriage may be inferred solely from the conduct of the parties.”</span></p><p class="MSGENFONTSTYLENAMETEMPLATEROLENUMBERMSGENFONTSTYLENAMEBYROLETEXT20" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 13.2pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.35pt; background: transparent; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="color: black;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">6.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="color: black;">The article then proceeds to refer to four situations which are said to be rather common: “(1) The only evidence of the agreement may be that the parties have lived together as husband and wife: from this a common law marriage is often inferred, even without proof of an express agreement: an implied agreement being sufficient. The parties may have purported to contract a marriage and lived together, but the agreement at the time it is entered into may be void because of some disability unknown to both parties. If, subsequently, the disability is removed, a new contract is in strictness.”</span></p><p class="MSGENFONTSTYLENAMETEMPLATEROLENUMBERMSGENFONTSTYLENAMEBYROLETEXT20" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 13.2pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.35pt; background: transparent;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="color: black;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">7.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="color: black;">There is no dispute that the Mohammedan marriage among muslims is not sacrament but purely civil contract.

Though generally solemnized with recitations from Koran, yet no positive service peculiar to the occasion is prescribed by law; writing not required; validity and operation of whole depends upon declaration or proposal and acceptance or consent of contracting parties before competent witnesses; (Bail.1.4). In Asha B.V. Kadir B., (1909) 33 Mad 22, it is stated, “marriage is contract between parties to live as husband and wife for term of their lives.” In Muhammadan Law by Faiz Badruddin Tyabji, Third Edition, marriage is defined in paragraph 17, and after considering different authorities the essentials of marriage are summed up as under:<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">  </span>“Marriage arises in Muhammadan Law</span></p><p class="MSGENFONTSTYLENAMETEMPLATEROLENUMBERMSGENFONTSTYLENAMEBYROLETEXT20" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 13.2pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; background: transparent;"><span style="color: black;">from a contract-(a) Providing for intercourse and the procreation of children; (b) commencing from the time of contract; (c) made for effectuating a marriage between a man and woman whose intermarriage is not prohibited by law; (d) entered into in accordance with the rules and forms laid down in s.17A to S.23, inclusive, and (e) by a person who has authority to contract in marriage the person purported to be married.” Quoting Fatawa Alamgiri in Abdul Kaidr V. Salina, (1886) 8 All. 149(155) it is stated, “also for the solace of life; one of the prime and original necessities of man. Therefore lawful in extreme old age after hope of offspring has ceased and even in the last or death illness.” The Mohammedan Law does not insist upon any particular form in which the contractual performance should be effected or that “the union should be evidenced by any writing, nor is the presence of witnesses essential for its validity”. In this connection Syed Ameer Ali in his Mohammedan Law, 6<sup>th</sup> Edition, following Fatawai Alamgiri, Vol.11 page 209 and Radd-ul-Muhtar, Vol. II page 429 opined, though among the Sunnis the presence of witnesses is considered necessary to the validity of a marriage their absence only renders it invalid which is ‘cured by consummation’. A marriage contract, it is stated, as a civil institution, rests on the same footing as other contracts. The parties retain their personal rights against each other as well as against strangers; and, according to the majority of the schools, have power to dissolve the marriage-tie, should circumstances render this desirable.</span></p><p class="MSGENFONTSTYLENAMETEMPLATEROLENUMBERMSGENFONTSTYLENAMEBYROLETEXT20" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 13.2pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.45pt; background: transparent; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="color: black;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">8.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="color: black;">To use the words of Baillie, marriage, like other contracts, “is constituted by ejab wa kabul or declaration and acceptance, but it confers no rights on either party over the property of the other. The legal capacity of the wife is not sunk in that of the husband; she retains the same powers of using and disposing of her property, of her entering into all contracts rendering it, of suing and being sued without his consent, as if she were unmarried. On the principle of contract of marriage, the author stated, in the language of the law, as in the common parlance, the formal conclusion of the contract is called ‘akd’ conveying the same meaning as the term ‘obligation’ in the Roman Law. In fact, akd is the completion of the contract which commences with the proposal or demand in marriage and ends with the consent.” Radd-ul-Muhtar, Vol. II, says “akd signified both proposal and assent, and that the word means the contract of marriage as well as co-habitation”.</span></p><p class="MSGENFONTSTYLENAMETEMPLATEROLENUMBERMSGENFONTSTYLENAMEBYROLETEXT20" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 13.2pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.45pt; background: transparent; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="color: black;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">9.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="color: black;">On the capacity of the parties to marry each other, Syed Ameer Ali says, “the validity of a marriage under the Mohommedan Law depends primarily on the capacity of the parties to marry each other. “The performance of the marriage according to the form prescribed in the place where the marriage is celebrated, or which would impress on the woman by the customary law of the Musalmans the status of a wife is a matter of secondary consideration”. Dicey on Domicile stated, it is recognized principle of law that the capacity of each of the parties to a marriage is to be judged of by their respective Lex domicilii.

Hidayatullah on Mulla’s principles of Mahomedan Law are based on the arguments made in Moung Kyi V. Ma Shwe Baw (1929) 7 Rang 777, 121 I.C. 718, Gagu Bibi V. Mesal Shaikh (1936) 63 cal 415 and 164 I.C. 957. In the absence of witnesses to the marriage, Mulla says in paragraph 254 “A marriage contracted without witnesses as required by sec.252 is irregular, but not void”. This rule has been upheld in Shahzada Begum V. Abdul Hamid (1950) Lah 773. As regards irregular marriage, Mulla following Baillie, 155 said in paragraph 264(3): “An irregular marriage is one which is not unlawful in itself, but unlawful ‘for something else’ as where the prohibition is temporary or relative, or when the irregularity arises from an accidental circumstances, such as the absence of witnesses.” It has been explained, the reason why certain marriages though irregular but not void that a marriage which is contracted without witnesses, the irregularity arises from an accidental circumstance. The effects of an irregular marriage may be terminated by either party, either before or after consummation, by words showing an intention to separate, as where either party says to the other about the intention of relinquishment. Even in respect of irregular marriage, if consummation has taken place, Mulla says, ‘the wife is entitled to dower, proper or specified, whichever is less (Paragraph 267(2)). The High Court Division, in the premises, on a superficial consideration of the principles of a legal marriage, termed the living of the appellant and the respondent together as husband and wife “adulterous relations”.</span></p><p class="MSGENFONTSTYLENAMETEMPLATEROLENUMBERMSGENFONTSTYLENAMEBYROLETEXT20" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 13.2pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.1pt; background: transparent;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="color: black;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">12.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="color: black;">Mr. Wadud Bhuiyan, learned counsel submitted that the plaint is totally silent as to the date, place and presence of witnesses of the marriage and the appellant having failed to prove the essentials of a marriage under Mohammedan Law, the High Court Division is perfectly justified in dismissing the suit.

Sona Kunwar, (1904) 36 Allahbad 295, Abdool Razack V. Aga Mahomed Jaffer Bindaneem, 21 Indian Appeal 56 and some other decisions. Under Hanafi and the Maliki Law, a presumption of marriage is inferred if the marriage is consummated from the retirement of the husband and the wife into the nuptial chamber, under circumstances which lead to the natural inference of matrimonial intercourse. Syed Ameer Ali stated that Muhammadan Law does not insist upon any particular form in which the contractual performance should be effected or that the union should be evidenced by any writing, nor is the presence of witnesses essential for its legality. For, though among the Sunnis the presence of witnesses is considered necessary to the validity of a marriage, their absence only renders it invalid which is cured by consummation. Therefore, according to the author, even if the person seeking a declaration of legal marriage failed to prove it in the absence of the witnesses, if he or she proves the consummation of marriage, it may be treated as valid marriage. “A marriage may be proved directly or presumptively; directly, by means of the oral testimony of the witnesses present at the marriage, or by documentary evidence in the shape of a deed of marriage; presumptively, by statement of parties or by evidence of conduct and reputation. As in many cases invalid marriages are rendered valid by consummations, and as the dower does not become due in its entirety until the marriage has been actually or constructively consummated, the question of consummation forms often an important element in the status of marriage”.</span></p><p class="MSGENFONTSTYLENAMETEMPLATEROLENUMBERMSGENFONTSTYLENAMEBYROLETEXT20" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 13.2pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.6pt; background: transparent;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="color: black;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">13.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="color: black;">Section 50 of the Evidence Act declares that "when the Court has to form an opinion as to the relationship of one person to another, the opinion expressed by conduct as to the existence of such relationship of any person, who as a member of family or otherwise, has special means of knowledge on the subject is a relevant fact". Illustration (a) to section 50 says; “the question is, whether A and B were married. The fact that they were usually received and treated as husband and wife, is relevant”. This section says when the question arises as to the presumption of marriage, the opinion that makes relevant is opinion expressed by conduct as to the existence of such relationship and not merely as to that relationship. It is for the Court to weigh such evidence and to come to its own opinion as to the relationship in question. When the Court has to form an opinion as to the relationship of one person to another, the opinion expressed by conduct, as to the existence of such relationship, of any person who, as a member of family or otherwise, has special means of knowledge on the subject, is a relevant fact. To narrow the ground by limiting it to "opinion expressed by conduct" so far an opinion expressed by conduct, i.e. by evidence of specific facts of the conduct mentioned in the illustration to section 50 of the Evidence Act. When a woman lives for a number of years in close association with a man and their children, who are acknowledged by the man as born to him; relations and persons of the village treated them as such, there is a presumption of legitimacy, if the witnesses prove the conduct of the man and the woman by their friends and neighbours from which the Court can draw this conclusion. It is not for the witness to draw the conclusion himself and to express a mere opinion about the very matter which the Court has to decide. Taylor in his Law of Evidence says, ‘general reputation’ is admissible to establish the fact of the parties being married.’ "When a person" says Fatawai Alamgiri, "has seen a man and woman living in the same house, and behaving familiarly towards each other as husband and wife, it is lawful to him to testify that the woman is the man's wife". Reference in this connection is the case of Khajah Hidayatoollah V. Raijan Khanum, (1844) 3 MIA 299 and Wise V. Sanduloonissia Chowodanee, (1867) 11 MIA 177. Faiz B. Tyabji in his Muhammadan Law, in Chapter ‘Proof and Presumption of Marriage’ in paragraph 81 stated: “when the question arises whether a marriage has been contracted in due form, the burden of is upon the person who affirms it; provided that unless the parties were prohibited from intermarrying it is in the following cases presumed that they were validly married, and the burden of proving that their cohabitation was illegal, shifts to the person who alleges it to be illegal; viz. where (1) it is proved that the parties cohabited together continuously and for a long period, as husband and wife, and were treated as such by their friends; or (2) either party has acknowledged that he or she was married to the other (and the other party has been confirmed, or acquiesced in, the acknowledgment.”</span></p><p class="MSGENFONTSTYLENAMETEMPLATEROLENUMBERMSGENFONTSTYLENAMEBYROLETEXT20" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 13.2pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.25pt; background: transparent; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="color: black;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">14.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="color: black;">There are exceptions to the presumption of cohabitation.

Their lordships were of the opinion that the term acknowledgment is used, say, a child born out of wedlock is illegitimate; if acknowledged, he acquires the status of legitimacy. When, therefore, a child really illegitimate by birth becomes legitimated, it is by force of an acknowledgment expressed or implied, directly proved or presumed. The facts are that Abdul Hadee left a will bequeathing everything to his brother Hadjee Hosain, in which he mentioned that he had offspring in Burma. According to one witness, the offspring is Abdool Razack and expressed a wish that his brother should give him something.

Ma Mya and others, 165 IC 232, a Division Bench of the Rangoon High Court argued that according to Mohammedan Law, where there had been continual cohabitation between a man and a woman, which is not a mere casual concubinage, but a more permanent connection and a child has been born, and where there is no insurmountable obstacle to such a marriage, then the presumption is in favour of such a marriage having taken place. It is further argued that where cohabitation between a man and a woman was continuous from the time when they first met, either through an elopement or in consequence of an ordinary marriage before a moulvi, and that that cohabitation was with repute, it must be held that a valid marriage existed between them. These views have been taken with the approval of the views taken in Khajah Hidayut Oolah V. Rai Jan Khanum, 3 MIA 295. In Bashir and others V.

The above views were taken from a passage of Tyabjee, Muhammadan Law, as under: “Legitimacy of a child may be presumed where there had been continuous cohabitation of the alleged parents, acknowledgement of the child by the father, treatment by the father of the mother and child, and repute and notoriety amongst members of the family, the community, or respectable members of the locality.”</span></p><p class="MSGENFONTSTYLENAMETEMPLATEROLENUMBERMSGENFONTSTYLENAMEBYROLETEXT20" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 12.0pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.25pt; background: transparent; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="color: black;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">20.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="color: black;">In Hamida Begum V.

Leave was granted to consider whether the principle of acknowledgement of sonship under the Muslim Law has been correctly considered by the High Court Division. In the said case, the question of marriage between Monwara Begum and Amir Ali Mia came under consideration. Khorshid Alam, the defendant, pleaded about the legal marriage. This Division though noticed that the defendant failed to prove marriage but taking consideration of the doctrine of acknowledgment of sonship held that there was legal marriage between Monwara Begum and Amir Ali Mia and that once acknowledgment of parentage is established, the marriage will be held proved. In that case this Division considered a decision of the Privy Council in 56 I.A.201 wherein it was argued that ‘until the claimant establishes his acknowledgment the onus is on him to prove marriage. Once he establishes an acknowledgment the onus is on those who deny a marriage to negative it in fact.’ The plaintiff denied the existence of the marriage and this Division shifted the onus upon the plaintiff to prove that there was no marriage. This Division concluded its opinion with the observation that “the person who deny it (marriage) will have to be established. In other words, it was for the plaintiff to prove that there was no marriage with Monwara Begum as alleged”.

The sources of presumptions of fact are, (i) the common course of natural events, (ii) the common course of human conduct, and (iii) the common course of public and private business. When a presumption operates in favour of a party, the burden of proof is on the opponent and when a burden of proof is on a party, there is a presumption operating in favour of the opponent. A presumption of fact is a rule of law that a fact otherwise doubtful may be inferred from a fact which is proved. The difference between Hanafi and Shia School is that in Hanafi law in regard to valid retirement has the same effect as consummation in respect of (1) the confirmation of Mahr; (2) the establishment of descent, or paternity; (3) the necessity for the wife observing iddat; (4) the wife’s right to maintenance and residence during iddat; and (5) the prohibition by conjunction against the husband marrying the wife’s sister or other four women with her.

A presumption of consummation is raised from the retirement of the husband and wife, i.e. there should be no third person at the place and that the place should not be a public one, like a public bath, public road, a mosque etc. Where there has been prolonged and continuous cohabitation as husband and wife, in the absence of direct proof a presumption arises that there was a valid marriage. The law permits no specific ceremony for the contractual performance of a marriage: and no religions rites are necessary for contracting a valid marriage. There are even opinions that a marriage may be constituted without any ceremonial and even in the absence of direct proof, indirect proof might suffice. The High Court Division, in the premises, erred in holding that mere living together as husband and wife did not bring it within the bound of marriage. Apart from acknowledgment by either party, if there is continual cohabitation between a man and woman as husband and wife, there is presumptive marriage and legitimacy provided that the parties were not prohibited from intermarrying.</span></p><p class="MSGENFONTSTYLENAMETEMPLATEROLENUMBERMSGENFONTSTYLENAMEBYROLETEXT20" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 12.0pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 26.9pt; background: transparent; margin: 0in 0in 6.3pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="color: black;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">26.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="color: black;">As regards the submission that the plaint is silent regarding the date, the place and the presence of witnesses of the marriage, it is too late in the day to examine and reopen the findings of fact arrived at by the Courts below on a fresh assessment of the pleadings and the evidence by this Division. As the ultimate Court in the land, this Division, as a rule, should give due weight and consideration to the opinions of the courts below, in particular, to the opinion of the trial Court which had the advantage of observing the veracity of the witnesses and watching their demeanour. We find that the High Court Division has totally overlooked the presumption of a muslim marriage and relying upon paragraph 252 of Mulla’s Mohammedan Law disbelieved the appellant’s claim of marriage. If the High Court Division had considered paragraphs 254 and 268 of Mulla’s Mohammedan Law, its decision would have been otherwise. The High Court Division based its decision on piecemeal consideration of Mulla’s Mohammedan Law and arrived at a decision which is not supported by any of the authors of Mohammedan Law. It has tried to apply a doctrine of Muslim Marriage against the established schools of Mohammedan Law. Therefore, the decision of the High Court Division is based on a misconception of the basic principles of Mohammedan Law and thus the interference of the judgments of the Courts below is an error of law apparent on the face of the record. The evidence on record sufficiently proved that there was existence of legal marriage between the appellant and respondent. The High Court Division, in the premises, exceeded its power in interfering with the concurrent findings of fact in the absence of any misreading or non-consideration of the evidence on record. Accordingly, we find merit in contention of Dr. Rabia Bhuiyan. The appeal is, therefore, allowed with costs of Tk.10,000/-.</span></p><p class="MSGENFONTSTYLENAMETEMPLATEROLENUMBERMSGENFONTSTYLENAMEBYROLETEXT20" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 11.6pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; background: transparent;"><span style="color: black;">Ed.</span></p></div></div>
