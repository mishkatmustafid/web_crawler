The acceptance of the respondent bid was communicated by Memo. dated 24-11-97. The respondent deposited Taka 6,78,000.00 as security money upon furnishing Bank guarantee. The respondent also executed the contract. But all on a sudden respondent No.9 by Memo. dated 4-12-97 cancelled the contract which the respondent challenged in the instant writ petition.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> The petitioner’s contention in their affidavit-in-opposition was that the offer of the respondent was found not to be tallying with the specification of the work as tendered by the petitioner, at the time of re-examination.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> As already noticed the High Court Division made the Rule Nisi absolute.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> Aminul Haque, learned Advocate for the petitioner, submits that the writ petition arises out of a contract and in case of its failure or breach the respondent’s remedy did not lie in a writ petition which the High Court Division erred in law in entertaining.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> Basically, the principle is that, a writ petition cannot be founded merely on contract, but when a contract is concluded, the contractor has a legitimate expectation that he will be dealt with fairly. The petitioner could have asked the respondent to supply the water tanks and generator according to specification and could have given him an opportunity to complete the work according to specification, taking the anomaly during re examination to be correct; but to cancel the contract unilaterally without regard to subsequent developments is a high feat of arbitrariness which rightly attracts the writ jurisdiction.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> Aminul Haque next submits that the High Court Division acted in excess of jurisdiction in awarding a high cost of Taka 10,000.00 to the respondent.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> In view of the highhandedness and arbitrariness of the impugned action we do not think that the High Court Division acted in excess of jurisdiction. The cost has been rightly given.<br/> <br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></span></div></div></div>
