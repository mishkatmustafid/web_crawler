The suit in which this question has arisen is Title Suit No. 842 of 1981 in the 1st Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka, filed by the appellant-plaintiff. It is a suit for ejectment of a monthly tenant, namely, the Government and for realisation of arrear rent along with mesne profits. The Military Estate Officer did not enter appearance or file any written state­ment; but a written statement was signed and verified by the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka and it was accepted by the trial Court upon rejecting the appellant's contention that the Deputy Commissioner got no <em>locus standi</em> to file any write statement on. behalf of the Government in the Ministry of Defence repre­sented by the Military Estate Officer, who is the only officer authorised by law to sign and verify written statement in a suit about a land lying within the Cantonment area.<br/><br/>2. Facts of the case, so far necessary for disposal of this appeal, are given below: The appellant's father Aminuddin took lease of a piece of land in Dhaka Cantonment Area for 99 years from the then President of Pakistan in 1966 and constructed a house thereon which was numbered as Premises No. 40. Mohakhali (New D.O.H.S), During the liberation war Aminuddin was stranded in Karachi where he died but his family including his son the plaintiff-appellant, a widow and two daughters was in Dhaka, In the. beginning of 1972, just after liberation, the house was included in the list of Abandoned Properties by the Can­tonment Board, but on a representation by the appellant and other heirs of the late Aminuddin, the Executive Officer, who is the authorised officer of the Cantonment Board, struck the house off the list of Abandoned Properties by an order dated 22 September 1972, and by a subsequent order dated 19 March 1974 mutated the names of the appellant and his mother and two sisters as owners of the proper­ty. Thereafter, a part of the house in the ground floor, was taken lease of under a Deed of Lease dated 9 August 1974 by the Government of Bangladesh represented by the Military Estate Officer at a monthly rent of Tk. 500/-which was later on raised to, Tk. 750/-. The Military Estate Officer allotted the house to two Naval Officers. The lease was renewed year by year upto June 1981 after which no further renewal was sought. Rent was paid upto April 1981 and since then no rent was paid. The appellant determined the tenancy with effect from 30 September 1981 by serving a notice under the Transfer of Property Act, but as the premises was not vacated the appellant filed the suit, The Mili­tary Estate Officer did not file any written statement; but after two years from the date of filing of the suit, a written statement was filed by the Government-Pleader, Dhaka, signed and verified by the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka, and later on, an additional written statement was filed by the Deputy Commiss­ioner through the Additional Government Pleader, Dhaka. The plaintiff raised objection to the acceptance of these written statements taking the ground that in this suit against the Government, in the Ministry of Defence, the Military Estate Officer is the only authorised person under Order XXVII Civil P.C. and the Cantonment Act, read along with Military Land Manual, and that Tie Deputy Commiss­ioner got no locus stem It to file written state­ment. The objection was overruled and the written statements were accepted by the trial Court by orders dated 28-3-85 and 5-5-85. The appellant challenged these orders by a revisional application before the High Court Division, and a learned Single Judge, by the impugned order dated 11 July 1985, refused to interfere in the matter observing that "when the defen­dant has filed a written statement signed and verified by the Deputy Commissioner it would be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that he had authority and instructions to file written statements".<br/><br/>3. Mr. T.H. Khan, learned Advocate for the appellant, contends that this observance of the learned Single Judge as quoted above, h totally erroneous, for m the face of clear provision of statutes there was no scope for the Court to draw any presumption in favour of the Deputy Commissioner to file written statement. The learned Counsel has gone straight to Order XXVII of the Civil P.C. and has submitted that rule 1 of that Order has made specific provisions as to who is authorised to sign and verify the plaint or written state­ment by or on behalf of the Government. For better appreciation of the question raised rule (1) of this Order is quoted below:<br/>"1. In any suit by or against the Government, the plaint or written statement shall be signed by such person as the Government may, by general or special order, appoint in this behalf, and shall be verified by any person whom the Government may so appoint and who is acquainted with the facts of the case"<br/><br/>4. Rule 1, as quoted above, provides that in any suit by or against the Government, the plaint or written statement shall be signed by such person as "the Govern­ment may, by general or special order ap­point". In pursuance of this rule of Order XXVII C.P.C. the Government by a Noti­fication dated the 14th December, 1955, authorised certain officers, as specified in the Schedule of the said Notification, to sign and verify the plaint or written state­ment in a suit by or against the Govern­ment. The Schedule enlists 20 Ministries, and for each Ministry, certain officers have been authorised to sign and verify the plaint-written statement on behalf of the Govern­ment. In respect of the Ministry of Defence, under sub-head "Military Lands and Canton­ment Service" as the Notification shows, the authorised person is "any Military Estate Officer". The suit in question relates to a premises in the Cantonment Area, and as such, the Military Estate Officer is the person who has been specifically appointed by the Government to sign and verify a plaint or written statement on behalf of the Government in the ''Ministry of Defence." Appointment of such an officer is all the more necessary because the plaint/written state­ment as referred to is required to be verified by a person "who is acquainted with the facts of the case''. In this suit relevant facts are within the personal knowledge of the officer who dealt with the matter all through; he is the Military Estate Officer. It is the Milit­ary Estate Officer who had signed the Lease Deed dated 22 September 1972 on behalf of the lessee, the Government of Bangladesh; it is he who made payment of rent of the premises to the lessor, the plaintiff, till default started, and it is he upon whom the notice for termination of the tenancy was served. The De­puty Commissioner was not in the picture at all and he is not acquainted with the facts of the case in any manner whatever. In view of these facts, it is obvious, the Government appointed the Military Estate Officer as the authorised person to sign and verify plaint and written statement on behalf of the Government, In respect of land in Canton­ment area no other person has been appointed for this purpose. This position of law as per Order XXVII C.P.C. has been simply reasserted in the relevant provisions of Rules and Manual made under the Cantonment Act, such as Rule 10 in Appendix-C of the Military Land Manual and sections 2(XXa) 280 and 281 of the Cantonment Act.<br/><br/>5. Mr. Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan, learned Additional Attorney General, does not dispute the Notification of the Government dated 14 December 1955, but he has made two sub­missions to show that notwithstanding anyth­ing in rule 1 of Order XXVII C.P.C., the Deputy Commissioner got authority to sign and verify the written statement in this case. One submission is that the Military Estate Officer requested the Deputy Commis­sioner and forwarded the relevant facts to him to sign and verify a written statement, and the other submission is that the Deputy Commissioner who is also Collector of the district, is the recognized agent of the Government in all judicial proceedings and as such he got power under rule 2 of Order XXVII, C.P.C. to sign and verify, plaint or written statement on behalf of the Government. For con­venience the second submission will be considered first. Rule 2 is quoted below:<br/>"2. Persons being ex officio or otherwise authorised to act for the Government in respect of any judicial proceedings shall be deemed to be the recognized agents by whom appearances, acts and applications under this Code may be made or done on behalf of the Government'<br/><br/>6. Rule 2 as quoted above has made a general provision authorising 'the recognized agent' who is said to be the Collector of a district, to act for the Government in any judicial proceeding. This general provision in rule 2 as clearly appears, is not applicable in a case in which specific provision has been made in pursuance of rule 1; the general provision, which is in fact a residuary provision, will come into operation in a field which has hot been covered by the specific provision made under rule 1. The Gazette Notification dated 14 December 1955 as referred to above has specifically enlisted certain persons in different Ministries of the Government who have been specifically "appointed to sign and verify" the plaint or written statement in respect of subjects which are specially within their respective Departments and Ministries. In view of this special provision in rule 1, the general and residuary provi­sion in rule 2 is not applicable. This provi­sion will also not be applicable in view of the special provisions made under the Cant­onment Act and the Military Land Manual which specifically authorise the Military Estate Officer for this purpose.<br/><br/>7. As to the submission that the Deputy Commissioner has been authorised by the Military Estate Officer to sign and verify the written statement, the appellant has challenged it and contended that the written statement has been filed malafide, at the instance of interested persons, who have been harassing him in all possible ways. Mr. T.H. Khan has contended firstly, that the Military Estate Officer got no power to request, authorise, or direct the Deputy Commissioner to sign and verify the written statement, for under rule 1 of Order XXVII, Civil P.C. it is only the government which has got power to authorise a person to sign and verify plaint/written statement on its behalf and that the Military Estate Officer himself being vested with a delegated power cannot redelegate it to some other person. Secondly, learned Counsel contends, in view of the trend of events concerning the house in question the Military Estate Officer or for that purpose the Cant­onment Board which is the proper authority to deal with such matter, did not and cannot authorise or advise the Deputy Commissioner to file a written statement which comes in direct conflict with their consistent stand in this matter. In the written state­ment verified by the Deputy Commis­sioner the defence taken in the suit for ejectment is that the plaintiff is not the land­lord as the premises is an "abandoned pro­perty". But the Military Estate Officer who took lease of the premises under the Lease Deed and paid rent to the plaintiff for 6 years is estopped from disputing landlord's title in the ejectment suit. The learned Counsel has referred to the Annexure filed by the appellant in this appeal, such an Annexure M, M(1),0, 0(1), 0(2), 0(3) and a copy of the judgment of the High Court Division in Cri­minal Revision No. 285 of 1982. Those pa­pers show that the Cantonment Board did not treat the premises as an abandoned property; rather the Board mutated the appellant as owner of the property; the Director, Military Lands and Cantonment, by letter dated 4 December 1981 addressed to the Naval Head Quarter, Banani, communicated that the pre­mises was never an abandoned property. In spite of these facts, the appellant was prosecu­ted at the instance of respondent 5, an officer of the Naval Head Quarter and others on charge of misappropriating Tk. 3 lacs and odd which he received as rent paid by the Government, lessee through the Military Estate Officer. The proceeding was quashed with a finding that no criminal offence was commit­ted by the appellant in accepting rent for his own house. Even thereafter, a certificate pro­ceeding was started against him for realisation of the money paid to the appellant by the Military Estate Officer as rent of the premises<br/><br/>8. Be that as it may, in a suit for ejectment of a monthly tenant it is the tenant who is the only person acquainted with the facts of the case to contest the suit, independent of any other question. In this suit the Military Es­tate Officer in view of the statutory provi­sions, is the only person authorised to sign and verify a written statement on behalf of the government and the Deputy Commissioner got no locus standi to sign and verify any writ­ten statement. The impugned written state­ments signed and verified by him are not written statements in the eye of law. The view taken by the High Court Division is erroneous.<br/>In the result, the appeal is allowed. The impugned orders of the High Court Division and the trial Court are set aside. No order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
