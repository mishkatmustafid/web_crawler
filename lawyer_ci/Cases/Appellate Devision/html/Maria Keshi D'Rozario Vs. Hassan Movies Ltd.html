Respon­dent-landlord filed the suit for ejectment, S.C.C. Suit No.12 of 1984, Dhaka, only on the ground of default on the part of the tenant in paying rent for the months of January and February 1984. Appellant contended that she did not make any default but de­posited the rent with the Rent Controller under the provisions of s.18 (5) and s.19 (1) of the Premises Rent Control Ordinance, 1963, briefly the Ordi­nance. Both the Courts below held that the rent was to be paid in terms of the Lease-Agreement of the parties, by the 5th of each current month and not un­der the provision of s. 18(5) of the Ordinance, by fif­teenth day of the next month and as such the deposit of the rent under s. 18(5) would not protect the tenant from ejectment for default.<br/><br/>2. Respondent landlord created a monthly tenancy in favour of the appellant by letting a shop room in the Balaka Building tinder an Agreement of Lease dated 1 September 1978 for the period ending by 31 December 1983 at a rent of Tk.600/- per month, which was later on, raised to Tk.750/- by mutual agreement. About three weeks before the expiration of this period, respondent addressed a letter dated 7 December 1983 to the tenant informing her that after the expiry of the period of the lease if she was will­ing to continue as a tenant, she would be required to pay enhanced rent of Tk. 4000/- per month and for that purpose to renew the lease on fresh terms and conditions. The appellant by a letter dated 21 Decem­ber 1983 informed the respondent that, when he (landlord) had agreed to accept enhancement of rent by 10% on the existing rates from all other tenants in the same Balaka Building, she was ready to pay the enhanced rent by 10%; no agreed rent was yet fixed but the appellant continued as a tenant. The re­spondent treated the appellant as a tenant holding over and found that the tenant did pay rent by the 5th of each current month in terms of the previous Agreement; he then served a notice dated 23 February 1984 under section 106, T.P.Act and terminated the tenancy with effect from 31 March 1984 on the ground that the rent of February and January was not paid by the 5th of the month concerned. He then filed the suit for ejectment of the appellant.<br/><br/>3. In a written objection the appellant contended that when the Lease Agreement expired and the re­spondent proposed renewal of the tenancy on fresh terms and conditions including enhanced rent, the old Agreement would not apply and consequently the date of payment of rent would be governed by s.18 (5) of the Ordinance which provides that in the ab­sence of any contract as to when rent is to be paid, the rent for every month is to be paid by the 15th of the month next following the month for which rent is due; accordingly she offered the rent of January which was refused by the respondent whereupon she sent it by postal Money Order dated 8 February 1984 and when it was returned as "refused" on 29 February 1984, she again sent the rent of January, February and March together by postal Money Order dated 5 March 1984. But without waiting for the acceptance of the Money Order by the landlord, the appellant filed House Rent Case No.54 of 1984 on 13 March 1984 and deposited the rent of January and February to the Kent Controller on 14 March 1984 and since then she has been continuously and regularly depos­iting the rent to the Rent Controller and as such she was not a defaulter. As already stated above, the trial Court as well as the revisional Court held the appel­lant 'defaulter' on the basis that the rent was to be, paid by the 5th of each current month in terms of the Agreement.<br/><br/>4. Leave was granted to consider whether the appellant was liable to pay rent in terms of the old Agreement or she was entitled to pay rent according to the provision of s. 18(5) of the Ordinance. At the outset I would make it clear that on the facts admit­ted or established in this case, if the terms of the expired Agreement apply in respect of the due date for payment of rent, then the appellant is a defaulter, but if s. 18(5) applies, she is not. Mr. Rafiq-ul-Huq, learned Counsel for the respondent, has made some efforts to show that even if s. 18(5) is applicable to this case still the appellant is a defaulter, for she paid three months' rent in lump at a time by the Postal Money Order dated 5 March 1984. He has sought re­liance from the decision of this Court in a number of cases of this point particularly in the case of <em><strong>Prafullah Kumar Chakraborty v. Anil Prosad Chowdhury, 33 DLR (AD) 55.</strong></em> In that case it has been held that the payment of rent in lump for several months does not save the tenant from the mischief of default. Yes, if the rents of several months 'paid in lump' are arrears rents wholly or partly, that is, the payment was made beyond the due dale in respect of each month, then the payment in lump would be of no avail and the tenant would not be protected from ejectment. But if the payment in lump was made by the due dale or in advance in respect of each month, then, this decision will not apply. In the instant case, the learned Counsel for the respondent argues, the rents for January, February and March were re­mitted by Money Order on 5 March 1984 but before this date, the rent for January already fell arrear, that is, it was not paid or remitted by 15th of February under s. 18(5), and because of this default for the month of January, the subsequent remittance of rent for February and March along with that of January will not take the tenant out of the mischief for de­fault.<br/><br/>5. This contention of the learned Counsel would have been accepted as correct but for the facts of this case. Before the Money Order dated 5 March there was another Money Order dated 8 February for the rent of January. That Money Order was returned undelivered as refused on 29 February 1984. The ap­pellant then deposited the rent of January, along with rent of February, on 14 March, that is, within a peri­od of fifteen days of return of the Money Order on 29.2.1984. The fact that the rents of January, Febru­ary and March were also sent together by Money Or­der dated 5 March 1984 is immaterial in view of the deposit with the Rent Controller made within the statutory period. This Money Order was not neces­sary when the earlier Money Order was returned and within 15 days from the date of return the rent was deposited with the Rent Controller under s. 19 of the Ordinance.<br/><br/>6. The provisions for remitting rent by postal Money Order and thereafter deposit of rent with the Rent Controller have been explained by this Court in the cases of <em><strong>Abu Leyes v. Anwara Khalun, 29 DLR, SC 13 and Ramjan Ali v. Hedayatullah, 31 DLR (AD) 183.</strong></em> The onus to bring a case within the ambit of s.19 as to deposit lies on the tenant and conditions for remittance by Money Order and depos­it with Rent Controller are to be fulfilled by him be­fore he makes deposit The tenant must offer the rent of a month within the period fixed in the contract, if any, or within the fifteenth day of the next month as referred to in s. 18(5). If the rent offered is refused the tenant shall remit it by Money Order within the peri­od fixed, and if the Money Order is returned undeliv­ered, then the tenant shall deposit it with the Rent Controller within fifteen days of return of the Money Order. All these conditions are found fulfilled in this case and as such the deposit made on 14 March 1984 is a valid deposit. Since that first deposit the appel­lant has been regularly depositing the rent for each month to the Rent Controller. In support of regular and uninterrupted deposits the appellant has filed an Affidavit along with the photo copies of month-wise deposits with the Rent Controller all through. As such, the appellant is not a defaulter if s. l8 (5) is ap­plicable to her case.<br/><br/>7. But the crucial question is whether the appel­lant is entitled to the benefit of s. 18(5) or is liable to pay rent under the terms and conditions of the Agree­ment. This Agreement requires that the rent be paid by the 5th of each current month, that is, rent of, say, January, is payable by 5th of January. Kh. Mahbubuddin Ahmed, learned Counsel for the appel­lant, contends that the period of tenancy created by the Agreement dated 1 September 1978 having ex­pired on 31.12.83 its terms are hot applicable to the case of the appellant after the expiration of the period mentioned in the Agreement, and as such, the appel­lant's case is automatically governed by s.18 of the Ordinance. Sub-section (1) of s.18 provides:<br/>"Notwithstanding anything contained in the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, or the Contract Act, 1872, no order or decree for the recovery of possession of any premises shall be made as long as the tenant pays rent to the full extent al­lowable by this Ordinance and performs the conditions of the tenancy."<br/>Sub-section (5) of s.18 provides:<br/>"No tenant shall be entitled to the benefit of this section in respect of any premises unless he pays the rent due by him in respect of such pre­mises to the full extent allowable by this Ordi­nance within the time fixed in the contract with his landlord or, in the absence of such contract, by the fifteenth day of the month next following that for which the rent is payable, * * * * * * * * * * *”<br/><br/>8. Mr. Rafiq-ul-Huq, learned Counsel for the re­spondent, however, contends that the terms and con­ditions of the old Agreement arc applicable to this case since the appellant on the expiration of the peri­od of the Agreement has been holding over under s.116 T.P. Act and since she has been holding over all the terms and conditions contained in the previ­ous Agreement arc binding upon her. s. 116 of-the T.P. Act reads thus:<br/>"116.If a lessee or under-lessee of property remains in possession thereof after the determi­nation of the lease granted to the lessee, and the lessor or his legal representative accepts rent from the lessee or under-lessee, or otherwise as­sents to his continuing in possession, the lease is, in the absence of an agreement to the con­trary, renewed from year to year, or from month to month, according to the purpose for which the property is leased, as specified in section 106."<br/><br/>9. Kh. Mahbubuddin Ahmed's contention is that the appellant was not holding over under s.116, T.P. Act, but she has been continuing as a tenant under her statutory right, that is, under section 2(8) of the Ordinance. This section defines a tenant and says that a "tenant means any person by whom, or on whose account, rent is payable for any premises and includes a ... person continuing in possession af­ter the termination of the tenancy in his favour." The learned Counsel contends that this provision of the Ordinance which is a special law vis-à-vis the Trans­fer of Property Act prevails over the latter and whether the appellant falls within the ambit of s. 116 of the T.P. Act or not she is a tenant by statutory provision of a special statute, namely section 2(8) of the Ordinance. As to the ingredients of a tenancy by 'holding over', the learned counsel contends that the main ingredients of a tenancy by holding over are ab­sent in the present case. He first argues that the te­nancy created by the Agreement dated 1.9.1978 was not 'determined' according to law by Notice under section 106, T.P. Act before 31 March 1984. He next contends that the landlord had not consented to the appellant continuing as a tenant under the terms of the previous Agreement when the landlord himself stated in his letter dated 7,12.83 that if the appellant wanted to continue she would have to pay rent of Tk.4000/- instead of Tk.750/-. Per month and further, she must renew the tenancy on fresh terms and con­ditions. Learned Counsel concludes that by the pro­posed renewal the landlord sought to create a new te­nancy, and as such application of terms and conditions of the old Agreement is out of question.<br/><br/>10. Mr. Rafiq-ul-Huq has, in support of his contention that on the expiry of the period of the Agreement of Lease dated 1.9.78 the appellant has become a tenant by holding over, relied upon a num­ber of decisions including some decisions from the Indian jurisdiction. In some of these cases tenancy was created by registered instruments and in some cases by unregistered instruments; and some of them were created for agricultural/manufacturing purposes and some for purposes other than agricultural or manufacturing purposes. But in all these cases tenan­cy by holding over was found established on the ex­piration of the period mentioned in the Agreement of Lease concerned. As to the period of a lease specific provision has been laid down in sections 106 and 107 of the T.P. Act. It is that in the absence of any registered instrument of lease, a lease for agricultural or manufacturing purposes will be treated as a lease from year to year, and a lease for any other purpose will be treated as a lease from month to month. A lease from month to month is terminable by 15 days' notice expiring with the end of the month concerned of the lease. Mr. Rafiq-ul-Huq has argued that since the Agreement of the parties was not registered her tenancy was in the eye of law for one year and on the expiry of one year the appellant was holding over. In the cases of <em><strong>Bashirullah v. East Pakistan, PLD 1962 (Dhaka), 127 and Sm. Lalita Roy and others v. Rafiqueullah Khan, 18 DLR 107,</strong></em> the erst­while Dhaka High Court held that an agreement to lease immovable property from year to year or for any term exceeding one year, accompanied by deliv­ery of possession, in the absence of a registered lease deed, is valid for one year, and if the lessee continues in possession with the consent of the lessor, the lessee becomes a tenant by holding over. This view has been approved by this Court in the case of <em><strong>Khodeja Begum v. Sagarmal Agarwalla, 1987 BLD (AD) 147.</strong></em> The Calcutta High Court also took a similar view in the case of <em><strong>Adhinath v. Krishna Chandra, 47 CWN 127.</strong></em> In all these cases it was held that for termination of a tenancy by 'holding over' valid no­tice under s.106 T.P. Act is necessary. The Indian Supreme Court also took the same view as to tenan­cy created by holding over under s. 116, T.P. Act, In <em><strong>"Satish Chandra v. Govardhan, AIR 1984, SC 143 and 'Burma Shell Oil v. Khawaja Midna Noor, AIR 1988, SC 1470,</strong></em> the Indian Supreme Court held the view that on the determination of a lease the tenant, if continues in possession with landlord's consent, becomes tenant by holding over. But original tenan­cies in these cases were created by registered instru­ments.<br/><br/>11. Mr. Rafiq-ul-Huq has given particular stress on the case of <em><strong>Nandalal Das v. Monmotha Nath Ghosh, AIR 1962 (Cal) 597.</strong></em> In that case, the monthly tenancy was created at the first instance by a registered instrument for a period of three years, which was renewed on several occasions, on the ex­piration of each previous period. It was held there that where the lessee after expiration of the period "fixed by the document" holds over, "it is the lease that is renewed with all the terms and conditions contained in the document of lease" which are not in­consistent with an annual tenancy. The learned counsel in the instant case argues that the period of lease expired on 31 December and the appellant continued with the tenancy thereafter; as such she is a tenant by holding over under s.116, T.P. Act and this being the actual position all the conditions of the previous Agreement including the condition for payment of rent by the 5th of each current month are applicable to her. But the learned Counsel must not be unmind­ful of the conduct of, and new conditions imposed, by die respondent for the purpose of continuation of the appellant's possession of the premises. It is the respondent who by his letter dated 7.12.83 informed the appellant that he was not ready to allow her to continue as a tenant on the existing rent but demand­ed higher rent of Tk. 4000/- as against Tk. 750/- under the Agreement, due to expire by 31.12.83. Secondly, in his letter the respondent advised the tenant for re­newal of the tenancy on "fresh terms and condi­tions." He has given in a subsequent letter the reason for demand of the high amount of rent mentioning that the tenant was consuming water for commercial purposes to run her restaurant. The appellant, by a letter dated 21.12.83, expressed her readiness to raise the rent by 10% as in the cases of other tenants of the respondent in the same building. No agreement between them was yet reached and the appellant was not certain about the rent and other conditions which might be fixed by mutual consent. In these circum­stances, the provisions of s.18 (5) and s.19 (1) of the Ordinance. In his notice under section 106 T.P. Act, the respondent, besides mentioning that rent for January and February was not paid in terms of the Agreement, alleged that the appellant becoming undesirable unless the tenant comes with­in the mischief of forfeiture under s. 111(g) of the T.P. Act. Under this section a tenancy may be deter­mined if the tenant violates any express condition of the tenancy stated in the Agreement for tenancy. There was no allegation of such nature against the appellant. Reading the letter dated 7.12.83 and the notice dated 23.2.84 of the respondent as against the appellant's letter dated 21.12.83 expressing her will­ingness to pay rent with moderate increase by 10% it is found that the respondent was in search of grounds for her ejectment. It is he who gave a go-by to the previous Agreement and demanded renewal of the te­nancy on fresh terms and conditions which were yet to be determined. In the circumstances, requirements of s.116, T.P. Act are not fulfilled so as to hold that the tenancy has been renewed with all its existing terms and conditions as referred to in the case of <em><strong>AIR 1962 Cal. 597</strong></em>, In all other cases also, on which learned Counsel for the respondent relies for support­ing a case of 'holding over', no enhancement of rent was demanded and no alteration in terms and condi­tions of the existing tenancies was made. Continua­tion of the appellant's possession of the premises on expiration of the period of the tenancy on 31.12.83 is not unauthorised, for the landlord consented to this possession, but on a condition for the fulfillment of which no time was set by him. The appellant is not holding over within the meaning of s. 116 T. P. Act nor is she a tenant by sufferance either. But she is a tenant under s.2(8) of the Premises Rent Control Or­dinance and subject to the fixation of rent and other terms and conditions for a fresh tenancy the appellant is entitled to the benefit of s. 18(5) of the Ordinance.<br/><br/>12. Lastly, Mr. Rafiq-ul-Huq has pointed out that the House Rent Case in which the appellant started depositing rent was itself dismissed for default on 18.1.88 and though it was restored on 7.7.88, the deposits made during this period were not depos­its in the eye of Law. We have perused the Order-sheet of the House Rent Case No. 54 of 1984 along with the copies of Receipts of monthly deposits all through upto date. Since the rent was deposited with the Rent Controller in favour of the landlord we do not think that these are not deposits in the eye of law.<br/>In the result, the appeal is allowed without, however, any order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
