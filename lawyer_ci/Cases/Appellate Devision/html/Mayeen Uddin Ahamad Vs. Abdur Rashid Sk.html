The facts, leading to the filing of this petition, in brief, are that the petitioners instituted a suit being Title Suit No. 385 of 1988 in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Second Court, Dhaka, praying for declara­tion of title and recovery of khas posses­sion of the suit land.<br/><br/>3. Defendant No. 1 contested the suit by filing a written statement denying the plaintiffs title, possession and also the contentions in respect of dispossession as alleged in the plaint.<br/><br/>4. The learned Subordinate Judge framed five issues including one on the question of dispossession of the plaintiff from the suit land. After hearing and on considera­tion of the evidence on record, the learned Subordinate Judge found that the plaintiff is entitled to only one decimal of land and decreed the suit. On appeal being Title Appeal No.89 of 2001, the   learned Additional District Judge, Fifth Court, Dhaka, allowed the appeal by his judg­ment and decree dated 27.02.2006 and decreed the suit in full, holding that Osman Miah and Osman Gani were not the same person.<br/><br/>5. Being aggrieved, the defendant pre­ferred a revisional application before the High Court Division, being Civil Revision No.2155 of 2006.<br/><br/>6. The High Court Division by its judg­ment and order dated 16.10.2006, set-aside the Judgment and decree passed in appeal and dismissed the suit.<br/><br/>7. Mr. Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the peti­tioners, submits that the lower Appellate Court which is the last Court of facts on consideration of evidence adduced on behalf of both the parties found that the owner of the suit-land was Osman Miah and not Osman Gani. This finding of the Appellate Court, he submits, was not properly reversed by the High Court Division, rather, the High Court Division exceeded its revisional jurisdiction in reversing the decision of the lower Appellate Court without consideration of the evidence on record. But the learned Advocate fails substantiate his such con­tention from the impugned judgment.<br/><br/>8. We have gone through the judgment passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division. It appears that in reversing the findings of fact arrived at by the appellate Court below, the learned Judge considered the depositions of each and every witness and came to a definite finding  that, firstly, Osman  Miah and Osman Gani are the same person; second­ly, the possession and title of the defen­dants are supported by documentary and oral evidence; thirdly, the deeds of the title of the defendants were remained unchal­lenged; fourthly, the plaintiff failed to prove his title and possession in the suit-land and also failed to prove his case of dispossession as alleged in the plaint; and finally, the learned Judge held that the plaintiffs suit, praying for a decree for declaration of title and recovery of khas possession is  not  maintainable without seeking a further declaration that the deeds of the defendants are all forged, void, inoperative and not acted upon.<br/><br/>9. The learned Advocate appearing for the petitioners failed to dislodge these find­ings of the learned Judge of the High Court Division. It appears that the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division correctly set aside the judgment and decree dated 27.02.2006 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Fifth Court, Dhaka, in Title Appeal No. 89 of 2001, and dismissed the suit, as such, this petition merits no consideration and accordingly, it is dismissed.<br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
