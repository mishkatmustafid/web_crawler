Short facts as placed before the High Court Division are that the plaintiff instituted Other Class Suit No.121 of 1974 in the Court of Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Pabna stating, <em>inter alia,</em> that the suit land appertaining to C.S. Khatian No.133/2 of Mouza Bhatpara under police station Sujanagar, District Pabna originally belonged to Mathura Nath Brahmo and Satish Chandra Brahmo in equal shares. Mathura Nath Brahmo gifted his share to Jogendra Nath Brahmo, Nagendra Nath Brahmo and Kedar Nath Brahmo Sons of Jadav Chandra Brahmo by a registered deed of gift dated 24th Agrahayan, 1330 B.S. Satish Chandra Brahmo sold his share to one Jaladhar by a registered deed dated 1.2.1931. Jaladhar in his turn sold that land to Jogendra Nath Brahmo, Nagendra Nath Brahmo and Kedar Nath Brahmo by a registered deed dated 13.1.1932. In this way, the three brothers became owners of 16 anas share of C.S. Khatian No.133/2. The land of C.S. Khatian No. 133/1 of that mouza belonged to Sashi Bhusan Brahmo, Janaki Nath Brahmo and Jadav Chandra Brahmo in equal shares. While owning 1/3rd share of the said land, Jadav died leaving behind 3 sons namely Jogendra Nath Brahmo, Nagendra Nath Brahmo and Kedar Nath Brahmo as his heirs who thus became the owners of 1/3rd share in Khatian No. 133/1. While in possession as such, Kedar Nath Brahmo and Nagendra Nath Brahmo settled their shares with Jogendra Nath Brahmo pur­suant to two amalnamas dated 10th Ashin, 1349 B.S. and 15th Ashin, 1351 B.S. respectively and delivered posses­sion thereof. Later Kedar Nath died leav­ing behind Jogendra Nath as his heir. Thus Jogendra Nath got the entire prop­erty of schedule 'Ka' to the plaint and being in possession thereof for more than 12 years he sold the same to the plaintiff by a registered deed dated 24.4.1970 on receipt of consideration money. The S.A. record in respect of suit properties was prepared in the names of 3 brothers Jogendra, Nagendra and Kedar. Because of wrong recording in the khatian, some unscrupulous persons have been trying to take lease of the shares of Nagendra and Kedar out of the property shown in schedule 'Ka' to the plaint from the defendant No.1 after declaring those properties as vested. The property shownin the schedule to the plaint cannot be declared vested and the plaintiff has got valid right, title, interest and possession in those properties. Therefore, the plaintiff was constrained to file the suit.         <br/><br/>3. The defendant No.1, i.e., the Assistant Custodian, vested property, Pabna contested the suit by filing a written statement. The defendant Nos. 4-25 is the lessees who also filed a separate written statement but they ultimately did not contest the suit. The common case of the above mentioned defendants are that the suit properties were declared vested and the S.A. khatian was correctly prepared. Their further case is that Kedar, Nagendra and Jogendra Nath were 3 brothers   but   Kedar and Nagendra migrated to India long ago. The S.A. record was prepared at the instance of Jogendra who all along knew the fact of the record and the plaintiff had also the knowledge about the record. The interest of Kedar and Nagendra vested in the Government and accordingly, in vested property Miscellaneous    Case No. 5(Suja)/1970-71, their interests were declared vested and the defendant No.1 has since leased out the same to the defendant Nos.4-25. Therefore, the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>4. The trial Court on consideration of the materials on record decreed the suit in part in respect of 1/3rd share and dismissed the suit in respect of 2/3rd share.<br/><br/>5. On appeal being Other Appeal No. 260 of 1986, the appellate Court dismissed the appeal.<br/><br/>6. The High Court Division upon hear­ing the parties discharged the Rule.<br/><br/>7. We have heard Mr. Muhammad Nawab Ali, the learned Advocate-on-Record for the petitioner and perused the impugned judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record.<br/><br/>8. The High Court Division held that the trial Court and the appellate Court concurrently found that the plaintiff could not prove the settlement from Keder Nath Brahma and Nagendra Nath Brahma to Jogendra Nath Brahma by amalnama of their 1349 B.S. and 1351 B.S. respectively as the execution of the amalnama by examining described and witnesses was not proved although sufficient time was allowed for the purpose. The High Court Division further held that the Courts below also concurrently found that Jugendra did not acquire the interest of Keder by inheritance as the death of the latter could not be proved.  The High Court Division also noticed that the Courts below held that the plaintiff could not prove that he acquired 16 anas share in the property by adverse possession.<br/><br/>9. The High Court Division further held that there was no misreading and non-consideration of the material evidence on record by the Courts below and there­fore declined to interfere with the judg­ment of the Courts below.<br/><br/>10. In the facts and circumstances of the case, we find that the High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials on record discharged the Rule. There is no cogent reason to interfere with the same.<br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
