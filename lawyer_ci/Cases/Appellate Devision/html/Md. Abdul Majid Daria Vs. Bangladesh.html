By the impugned judgment the High Court Division set aside the award made by the Subordinate judge, Arbitration Court, Dhaka, on 23 February 1995 in Arbitration Case No. 38 of 1993 brought by the appellant and dismissed the arbitration case.<br/><br/>2. Briefly stated the facts are these. In order to build the Kurmitola International Airport in Dhaka the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka initiated L.A. Case No. 110 of 1965-66 respecting 46.92 acres of land of Mouza Faydabad including the disputed plot Nos. 1311, 1312, 1313, 1314, 1315, 1323, 1326, 1330, 1345, 1362 and 1366 (measuring 6.97 acres). Notice under section 3 of the East Bengal (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act, 1948, hereinafter called the Act, was issued on 13 June 1967. The Requisitioning authority took over possession of the land on 20.6.1967, 2.8.1967 and 1.9.1967. Meanwhile notices under section 5(1) of the Act were duly issued signifying the intention of the Government to acquire the lands for the said purpose and the owners of the plots involved were paid initial compensation.<br/><br/>3. On 5 June 1979 the appellant made an application to the Additional Land Acquisition Officer, Dhaka claiming compensation in respect of the disputed plots excepting plot Nos. 1345, 1362 and 1366 on the ground that he was the owner in possession of the same by registered documents when the Government took over possession thereof. The Kanungo in his endorsement upon this application noted that the his endorsement upon this application noted that the appellant by virtue of registered kabala Nos. 22712, 22689, 22635 dated 31 October 1978 had purchased disputed lands and on the basis of such purchase he had prayed for compensation. But a long time ago the compensation money for the lands had got distributed.<br/><br/>4. On 21 June 1979 the appellant made yet another application to the Additional Land Acquisition Officer, Dhaka for compensation in respect of plot Nos. 1266, 1345 and 1362 alleging that although the real owners were in possession and enjoyment of the lands, they were not given any compensation as the officials of the Deptt. rejected their claim and the papers on which the claim was made. Subsequently the owners of the lands sold the same to the appellant who had entered into previous agreements for sale. As the kabalas were not registered in his favour he did not make any claim for compensation earlier.<br/><br/>5. Upon the said applications the Additional Land Acquisition Officer started Misc. Case No. 4 of 1979. He signed notices for service upon the persons who had already received provisional compensation and in whose presence the matter was necessary to be heard and disposed of. These notices appear to have been served upon 27 out of 31 persons concerned till 26.2.1980 when the Additional Land Acquisition Officer heard the matter <em>ex parte</em>. He observed:<br/>'It is found that Umed Ali and Yousuf are recorded purchasers of C.S. Plot No. 1266,1345 and 1362 of mouza Faidabad as in the C.S. Parcha No. 182 but heirs of the C.S. recorded tenants and others have received payment of advance compensation money in suppression of the facts that these plots were already purchased by Umed Ali and Yousuf. The petr. M.A Majid Dharaia who is a purchaser under regd. Deed No. 28034, 44714, 44713 dt. 28.11.79, deed No. 22712 dt. 31.10.78 and deed No. 37464 dt. 3.10.79 from the heirs of Umed Ali and Yousuf (Faraj enclosed). The petr. Filed petn. Claiming payment of compensation money of misc. plots. This is a simple case of wrong payment to the following persons.<br/>They are directed to refund the money immediately failing which the money will be recovered under P.D.R. Act.' <br/><br/>6. Two days thereafter on 28 February 1980 the Additional Land Acquisition Officer passed another order respecting plot No. 1311 in dispute. After a lengthy discourse without hearing any parties or examining documents or even service of notice upon all the persons affected passed an order that provisional compensation was wrongly awarded and that the appellant was the rightful owner by way of purchase from the purchasers from the heirs of the recorded tenants. The Additional Land Acquisition Officer, by the same order, directed that 'award' be prepared in the name of the appellant in respect of the plots in question and that if any body was aggrieved by the order might seek redress in the competent court of law within the statutory period of 6 weeks from the date of the order. All concerned were to be informed.<br/><br/>7. Accordingly, a provisional compensation was assessed at Tk. 4,47,214.90 on 6 March 1980. But before it was made final the appellant received almost the entire amount towards the compensation till 1 December 1984, leaving a balance of Tk. 1,064.90 only.<br/><br/>8. The acquisition proceeding was completed and notified in the Gazette under section 5(7) of the Act on II October 1990. Two years thereafter the 'final award' was signed on 20 October 1992.<br/><br/>9. On 11 December 1992 upon an application dated 6 December 1992 made by the appellant the Additional Land Acquisition Officer issued and made over a notice of the 'final award' in Form ‘J’ under clause (aa) of section 7 of the Act to the appellant on 24 January 1993. It does not appear that prior approval of the Government was obtained for the assessment as required under the said provision. None of the other notices of the assessment was served upon any other awardees.<br/><br/>10. On 6 March 1993 the appellant approached the Arbitrator under clause (aaa) of section 7 for an award expressing his grievance against the fairness of the assessment of the compensation as aforesaid.<br/><br/>11. The Arbitrator jumped to an award of Tk. 31,68,62,235.10 from Tk.  4,47,264.90 which was a phenomenal increase.<br/><br/>12. The Government and the appellant preferred F.M.A. No. 112 of 1995 and F.M.A. No. 60 of 1995 respectively. The High Court Division called for the records of the L.A. Case for examination and doubted the genuineness of the proceeding of assessment of compensation in favour of the appellant but ultimately set aside the award made by the Arbitrator on the ground that the appellant who was fully aware of the assessment of the compensation did not make his application under clause (aaa) of section 7 to the Arbitrator in time. Accordingly F.M.A. No. 60 of 1995 was dismissed and F.M.A. No. 112 of 1995 was allowed by the impugned judgment dated 14 August 1996.<br/><br/>13. Being aggrieved the appellant has preferred these two appeals. Leave was granted to consider whether the high Court Division erred in law in holding that the proceeding for arbitration was barred by limitation.<br/><br/>14. Mr. Khandker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, learned Counsel submits that the notice of the assessment of compensation under clause (aa) of section 7 was served upon the appellant on 24 January 1993 which was within the period of limitation according to the proviso to clause (aaa) (ii) of section 7 of the Act. He argues that the High Court Division misdirected itself in law in taking the view that prior knowledge of the assessment, will be a substitute for notice under clause (aa) of section 7.<br/><br/>15. Mr. Shahabuddin Ahmed, Deputy Attorney General, on the other hand, urged that the entire records of the proceeding would show that the appellant had fraudulently and collusively obtained the award on the basis of a procured notice under clause (aa) of section 7 of the Act.<br/><br/>16. Mr. Khandker Mahbubuddin Ahmed appears to be quite correct in his stand that the period of limitation for approaching the arbitrator under clause (aaa) of section 7 would be commuted from the date of receipt of the notice by the awardee and not from the date of knowledge derived otherwise. It cannot be gainsaid that knowledge cannot be a substitute for actual service of notice which is the requirement of the statute. Nevertheless we have to sustain the judgment of the High Court Division for the reasons stated hereafter.<br/><br/>17. We have access to the records of the L.A. proceedings based upon which an Additional paper book on behalf of the respondent was prepared and filed before us. We have set out the substance of the proceedings in the foregoing paragraphs. The entire proceedings beginning from the application dated 5 June 1979 made by the appellant before the Additional Land Acquisition Officer ending with the conclusion of the proceeding before the Arbitrator appears to be a product of fraud and collusion.<br/><br/>18. In the application dated 5 June 1979 the appellant alleged that he was the owner in possession of the disputed plots by purchase when those were taken over by the Government. The possession was taken over by the Government on 20 June 1967, 2 August 1967 and 1 September 1967. But the report of the Kanungo, as already indicated, shows that the kabalas in favour of the appellant were all dated 31 October 1978. This falsifies the appellant's initial claim. The appellant started with a claim, which was untrue. The falsity of the claim is further confirmed by the uncontroversial statements in the counter-affidavit filed by the respondent before the High Court Division namely, that the kabalas under which the appellant claims were all dated 28 November, 1979 except one which was dated 3 October, 1979. The four registered kabalas certified copies of which were made Annexure A-A(3) appear to have been the basis for the claim of the appellant. Annexure-A dated 28 November 1979 has in its schedule of sale 3.53 acres comprised within 37 plots including the disputed ones. The total price has been shown as Tk. 6000/- towards which Tk. 3000/- is stated to have been paid in the year 1968, Tk. 2000/- in 1977 and Tk. 1000/- on the date of execution of the deed. Annexure-A (1) dated same has in its schedule of sale 1.77 acres comprised within 14 plots including more or less the same plots in dispute. It is priced Tk. 8000/- towards which payment of Tk. 4000/- has been shown in the year 1968, Tk. 2000/- the year in 1977 and Tk. 2000/- on the date of execution. These Annexures also show that the appellant tried to relate his purchases to prior agreements of the Year 1968.Annexure-A(3) dated 3 October 1979 has in its schedule of sale 2.12 acres comprised within plot No.  1311. This kabala is priced Tk. 10.000/- which has been shown to have been paid on the date of execution of the kabala with a narration that an agreement for sale in respect of the same land was made on 19 January 1968. But we have already seen that possession of the plots were taken over by the Government in 1967.<br/><br/>19. Then again, the claim of the appellant was heard and decided in his favour in Miscellaneous Case No. 4 of 1979 before any notice could be served upon the necessary persons, although notices appear to have been signed and ordered to be served by 12 January 1980 positively. Strangely enough, the miscellaneous case was heard <em>ex parte</em> on 26 February 1980 and an order was passed by the Additional Land Acquisition Officer directing the persons who had drawn advance compensation money to refund the same. After a lengthy surmise without examining the necessary materials he further ordered that 'award' be prepared in the name of the appellant in respect of the plots in question.<br/><br/>20. It is not understandable from the order in what manner the Additional Land Acquisition Officer had traced the title of the appellant and came to his conclusion. The appellant, as seen above, had already drawn Tk. 4,46,200.00 i.e. almost the entire amount towards the compensation till 1 December 1984.<br/><br/>21. After finalisation of the proceeding for acquisition and notification thereof in the Gazette the Additional Land Acquisition Officer was required to obtain the approval of the Government before issuing the notice of the assessment of the compensation in Form-J under clause (aa) of section 7. But the records show that no step for obtaining the approval of the Government was taken in the case of appellant.<br/><br/>23. It is interesting to note that the notice of the assessment under section 7(aa) to the appellant was delivered post haste. The notice was signed on 24 January 1993 and it was served directly to him on the same date without observing the practice and procedure of the office. The situation becomes clearer when we consider that none of the notices of the other awardees has been yet served.<br/><br/>24. The sequence of events described here above would show that the appellant made application before the Additional Land Acquisition officer claiming compensation when he had no title or interest in the case lands. He came to the scene only in 1979-12 years after the notices under section 5(1) and 5(3) of Act were served. The manner in which his case was processed naturally leads one to believe that there was unfairness and collusion in the entire deal. Also the notice of the assessment on the appellant in Form ‘J’ was without any legal authority and obviously, it was collusively procured. This notice cannot be considered a notice under clause (aa) of section 7 of the Act. Such a notice could not entitle the appellant to file the arbitration case. The arbitration proceeding was, therefore, without jurisdiction.<br/>In these circumstances we uphold the decision of the High Court Division although on different reasonings. The appeals are dismissed without any order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
