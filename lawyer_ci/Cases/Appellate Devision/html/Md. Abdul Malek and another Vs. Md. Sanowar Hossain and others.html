Hassan Ameen J.-</strong> The pre-emptee-petitioners seek leave to appeal against the judgment and order dated 21-01-2007 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.3107 of 2003 discharging the Rule affirming the judgment and order dated 29-05-2003 passed in Miscellaneous Appeal No.56 of 2002 by the First Court of the learned Joint District Judge, Tangail, allowing the appeal setting aside the judgment and order dated 29-05- 2002 passed in Preemption Case No.93 of 1999 of the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Tangail, dismissing the same.<br/><br/>2. The respondent No.1 as preemptor filed Preemption Case No.93 of 1999 in the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Tangail, against the petitioner Nos.1 and 2 as pre-emptor opposite-party Nos. 1 and 2 and respondent Nos. 2 and 3 as Vendor-oppo­site-party Nos.3 and 4 respectively under Section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 (subsequently convert­ed under section 24 of the Non Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949).<br/><br/>3. The case of the preemptor-respondent No.1, in brief, is that old Plot No. 352 and present Plot No. 562 measuring 0.35 deci­mals under old S. A. Khatian No. 233 and new Khatian No. 113, Mouza-Shontosh, Police Station and District-Tangail belonged to Kangal Chandra Denagir. After the death of said Kangal Chandra Denagir, his only son, Roma Choron Dey became owner of the property by inheritance. On 28-05-1956 by deed No.4660 Roma Choron Dey transferred the same that is 0.35 decimals of land to Girish Chandra Sarker. On 04-04-1985 by deed No. 4166 Girish Chandra sold 0.20 acres from the eastern side of the case plot to his son Gopal Chandra Dey and on 30-12-1990, the said Girish Chandra Sarker transferred the remaining 10.15 acres of the case plot to one Md. Joshon Ali and Monowara Begum, on 30-06-1991 Gopal Chandra Dey sold the said 0.20 acres of to one Md. Abdul Hye and Noor Jahan Begum. Thereafter, on 09-06-1993, Abdul Hye and Noor Jahan Begum transferred the 0.20 acres to the preemptor Sanowar Hossain and as such the preemptor is a co- sharer in the case plot by way of purchase. The preemptor has been owning and possessing the 0.20 acres of land by erection house thereon. Be that as it may, on 20-12-1998, the opposite-party Nos.2 and 3 transferred the aforementioned 0.15 acres to the pre-emptee petitioners behind the back and without the knowledge of the preemptor. The preempte-petitioners are strangers to the case plot. They are not co-sharers in the land and no notice of sale was served upon the preemptor. The sale deed with reference to the land under pre-emption was entered in the volume of the deed on 12-07-1999 as per provision of section 60 of the Registration Act. The preemptor obtained the certified copy of the deed on 18-10-1999 and came to know about the sale and the preemption case was filed on 18-10-1999 within the statu­tory period of limitation.<br/><br/>4. The petitioner Nos.1 and 2 as pre-emptees contested the preemption case by filling written objection denying the aver­ment of the preemptor, contending, <em>inter-alia</em>, that the pre-emptees are owning and possessing the suit land by way of bainapatra dated 06-12-1995 within the knowl­edge of the preemptor, the pre-emptees erected houses in the suit land and got the sale deed executed and registered on 20-11-1998 and owning and possessing the same opening separate holding for the same. The preemptees have spent Tk.2, 50,000/- for development of the suit land.<br/><br/>5. The trial Court upon hearing the parties dismissed the aforesaid preemption case on 29-05-2002. Against which, the pre­emptor filed Miscellaneous Appeal No.56 of 2002 before the learned District Judge, Tangail. The appeal on transfer was heard by the learned Joint District Judge, First Court, Tangail, who by his judgment and order   dated 29-05-2003 allowed the appeal by setting aside the judgment and order of the trial Court. Being aggrieved and dissatisfied thereby, the pre-emptee petitioners filed Civil Revision No. 3170 of 2003 before the High Court Division and the learned Judge of the High Court Division after hearing the parties dis­charged the Rule issued therein upholding the judgment and order of the lower appel­late Court. The High Court Division observed that although the pre-emptees are in exclusive possession of the proper­ty but the same has not been partitioned by mets and bounds pursuant to a decree of partition suit and the joma has not been separated. Hence, this leave-petition.<br/><br/>6. Mr. Garib Newaz, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioners, submits that the High Court Division failed to consider that the pre-emption case was not main­tainable as there is no joint possession and enjoyment of the property and the pre-emptor and pre-emptees are in exclusive possession of their respective portion sep­arately from the time of their two succes­sive predecessor and for all practical pur­poses there is nothing common between them and the land is completely divided and separated from the time of their pred­ecessors. He submits that from the time of the predecessors the land is divided into separate entity or unit and not in joint pos­session and enjoyment and they are in exclusive possession of their respective part having their separate Municipal hold­ing and as such the pre-emption will make the land unfit for the purpose for which the land is being used and therefore the judgment of the High Court Division is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>7. We have heard the learned Advocate for the petitioner and perused the materials available in record and reasons to believe that the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner have got no merit and accordingly, the same is dis­missed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
