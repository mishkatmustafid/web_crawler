Abdul Matin J.- </strong>This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 12.03.2006 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 2832 of 1997 making the Rule absolute and thereby setting aside the judgment and decree dated 11.06.1997 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, 1st Court, Naogaon in Title Appeal No. 292 of 1993 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, 2nd Court, Naogaon in Other Suit No.115 of 1991 dismissing the suit.<br/><br/>2. The facts, in short, are that the present petitioner and others as plaintiffs institut­ed Other class Suit No.115 of 1991 impleading the present respondent Nos.1-8 as defendants in the 2nd Court of the then Subordinate Judge, 2nd Court, Naogaon for a declaration that the order dated 10.04.1986 passed by the Government purporting to shift the office of Shihara Union Parishad from it's pres­ent site under Amanta Mouza to a new site under Custobai Mouza was illegal, void and inoperative. The said suit was institut­ed in a representative capacity under order 1, Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure on behalf of the people of Shihara Union Parishad.<br/><br/>3. The case of the plaintiffs, in short, was that the office of the Shihara Union Parishad was established at Amanta Mouza in the year 1972 and the purported shifting of its office to its new site at Custobai Mouza runs counter to the inter­est of the people of the Union Parishad concerned. Over and above the purported shifting of the office of the Union Parishad will require huge amount of money from the public exchequer. The present office of the Union Parishad at Amanta Mouza is best suited for the local people. Regard being had to the convenience of the peo­ple, the purported shifting of the office of the Union Parishad to Custobai Mouza at its new site has violated the rights of the people of the locality. Hence the suit.<br/><br/>4. Present respondent Nos.1 and 2 as defendant Nos.5 and 6 contested the suit and the case of the defendants was that the purported transfer of the Union Parishad office from its present site at Amanta Mouza to its new site at Custobai Mouza is a demand of the time and before passing of the impugned order dated 10.04.1986 the Divisional Commissioner of Rajshahi held an inquiry into the matter and on the basis of the inquiry report of the Divisional Commissioner the impugned order was passed by the Government. It took all the relevant factors into consider­ation. Besides, the plaintiffs opposite par­ties have no legal right to sue under Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act. Since no legal right of the plaintiff opposite parties has been infringed by the impugned order dated 10.04.1986 they are not entitled to any relief under the law.<br/><br/>5. After hearing the parties and in the facts and circumstances of the case, the trial court dismissed the suit on the observa­tion, <em>inter-alia</em>, that the plaintiff opposite parties has no legal character or status contemplated in Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act.<br/><br/>6. The present petitioner preferred Title Appeal No. 292 of 1993 before the District Judge, Naogaon which was eventually heard by the learned Additional District Judge, 1st Court, Naogaon and the appel­late court took a contrary view and found that the plaintiff opposite parties succeed­ed in proving their case and accordingly the lower appellate court allowed the appeal and decreed the suit by reversing the judgment and decree of the trial court.<br/>7. The defendant then filed Civil Revision No.2832 of 1997 before the High Court Division and the High Court Division by the impugned judgment made the Rule absolute and set aside the judgment and decree passed by the appellate court below.<br/><br/>8. We have heard the learned Advocate and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/><br/>9. The learned Advocate appearing for the petitioners submits that the High Court Division totally misconceived the termi­nology any 'legal character' as used by the legislature in Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act in deciding the maintainability of the suit brought by the plaintiff petition­er inasmuch as legal character may not always arise or emanate on the basis of a particular statue but it may arise from enjoyment of a right for a long period by a group of persons in a particular given fact and thus  erred  in  law  in passing the impugned judgment and order dismissing the suit and as such the same calls for interference by the Court.<br/><br/>10. It appears that the subject matter of the suit is shifting of the office of Shihara Union Parishad from its present site and the plaintiff sought for declaration that the order dated 10.04.1986 passed by the Government shifting the same to the new site is illegal, void and inoperative.<br/><br/>11. It appears that the site selection is the business of the Government and relates to policy matter concerning the administra­tion and the petitioner as plaintiff had no <em>locus standi</em> to challenge such a policy decision of the Government.<br/><br/>12. Further more it appears that the decision was taken after thorough inquiry by the Divisional Commissioner. The High Court Division has rightly found that the petitioner could not prove his right to any legal character or to any property and rightly held that the suit as framed is not maintainable.<br/>We find no merit in this petition which is accordingly dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
