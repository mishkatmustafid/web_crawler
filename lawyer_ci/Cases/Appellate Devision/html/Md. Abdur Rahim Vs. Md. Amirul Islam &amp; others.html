Short facts are that the pre-emptor filed Miscellaneous Case No.109 of 1996 under section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act in the First Court of Subordinate Judge  (now Joint District Judge), Rajshahi claiming pre-emption of the case land stating, inter alia, that the pre-emptor is a co-sharer in the case land by purchase and the opposite party Nos. 2 and 3 sold the case land by kabala dated 30.07.1996 to opposite party No.1 (pre-emptee) who is a stranger and the pre­emption case was filed on 10.10.1996 that is within time.<br/><br/>3. The pre-emptee contested the case by filing written objection denying the material    allegations made in the miscellaneous application and contended that the pre-emptor did not deposit the total consideration money and the pre-emptee made improvement of the case land by investing huge money.<br/><br/>4. The trial court dismissed the case. Being aggrieved the pre-emptor filed Miscellaneous Appeal before the High Court Division and the appeal was allowed.<br/><br/>5. We have heard Mr. Abdus Salam Kha, the learned Counsel for the petitioner and perused the impugned judgment and other connected papers.<br/><br/>6. While disposing of the leave petition, we have given specific findings that undispuledly the pre-emptor is a co-sharer in the case land by purchase and the pre-emptee is a stranger purchaser and the pre-emption case is within time. The only point raised was that the preemption case was barred by the principle of waiver, estoppel and acquiescence but the High Court Division on consideration of the materials on record came to the definite findings that the pre-emption proceeding was not barred by the principle of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence. There was also no materials on record to show that the pre-emptor took any part in bringing about the transaction or assisted in any away the sellers in selling the land or induced the buyers to make the purchase or that the pre-emptor negotiated the price of the case land.<br/>Thus it is clear that considering all aspects of the matter the leave petition was dismissed,<br/>The learned Advocate could not point out any new materials for review of the impugned judgment.<br/>Accordingly, the review petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
