Abdur Rashid, who acceptedTk. 20,000/- and 5 tolas of gold as dowry. Conjugal life of Selina Begum wasnot happy. He demanded Tk. 20,000/- moreas dowry, which having been refused he pronounced one Talaq on Selina Khatoon. SelinaKhatoon was a teacher of a local R.D. High School. Troublecontinued between Abdur Rashid and Selina Khatoon. On 31.05.1995 at about 3:00 p.m. Abdur Rashid came to the houseof the informant, where Selina Khatoon used to stay and approached her to go tothe house of Md. Barik Munshi for mediation of their family problem. SelinaKhatoon along with her younger sister Rokeya Khatoon and younger brother Md.Abu Bakkar Siddique (Babul) started for the house of Barik Munshi at about 4:00 p.m. Previously, also on thedirection of Abdur Rashid, Selina Khatoon visited the house of Barik Munshi onseveral occasions.  The informant came toknow from Md. Nasir Hossain (P.W.10) that Selina Khatoon, Rokeya Khatoon andAbu Bakar Siddique had been lying senseless in the house of Barik Munshi. Dr.Md. Waheduzzaman had gone to the house of Barik Munshi and declared all threevictims dead. The informant thereafter came to know that Abdur Rashid, Md. BarikMunshi, Md. Dudumia, Abdus Salam Sarker, Abdus Samad Sarker, Motin Sarker andRaishuddin Sarkar killed Selina Khatoon, Rokeya Khatoon and Abu Bakker Siddiqueby giving them poison. </p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New";Times New Roman";'>TheInvestigating Officer visited the place of occurrence, prepared the sketch mapwith index, prepared inquest report, examined the witnesses and recorded theirstatements under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Aftercompletion of investigation he submitted Charge-sheet under sections 302/34 ofthe Penal Code against 7 (seven) accused persons. </p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New";Times New Roman";'>   <span style='Courier New";'>Duringtrial the prosecution examined as many as 19 P.Ws. including Dr. Abdul Quader(P.W.12) who held the autopsy of the three deceased.  </span></p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New";'>The defence case, as it transpires from the trend of cross-examinationwas that the accused persons were innocent and the accused did not claim any dowryand no trouble occurred in respect of dowry. The victims committed suicide forunknown reasons.  </p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New";'>The learned Additional Sessions Judge, Sirajgonj after hearing theparties and considering the evidence and materials on record convicted theappellant under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code and sentenced him to death byhis judgement and order dated 18.07.2001.

Leave was granted to considerwhether the High Court Division was in error in not considering important factssuch as: there was no occasion of the appellant to invite the deceased Selinato the house of Barik Munshi for reconciliation and it was not possible thatfor the purpose of reconciliation she would take with her a younger brother andsister instead of her father and older brother; that reconciliation would beheld in the house of Barik Munshi instead of holding the same before the localChairman to whom notice of divorce was given; and that there was no evidence atall as to who administered the poison to Selina, her younger brother and sisteror how it was done and the circumstantial evidence does not lead to thepresumption that the appellant administered the poison.  </p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New";'>Mrs. Sufia Khatun, learned Advocate-on-Record appearing on behalf of theappellant submitted that the judgement and order passed by the High CourtDivision is neither proper nor in accordance with law. She further submittedthat in view of the facts, the High Court Division did not follow the establishedprinciples of assessment of evidence hence there has occasioned a gross failureof justice. The learned Advocate further submitted that since there was no eyewitness in the said case as to who saw the accused administering poison to thedeceased, as such relying on the so called circumstantial evidence was notlawful to find the convict appellant guilty of the murder of the deceased. Shelastly submitted the High Court Division convicted the appellant totally onsuspicion, conjecture and moral conviction rather than legal evidence. </p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New";'>   Mr. Biswajit Deb Nath, learned D.A.G.appearing on behalf of the respondent made submissions in support of theimpugned judgement and order of conviction and sentence. He further submittedthat there is clear evidence from the prosecution witnesses, namely P.W. 9 and P.W.13 that the victims were called away by the accused and were last seen in thecompany of the accused and hence the accused has a special responsibility underthe criminal law to explain the death of the victims. He submitted that all thecircumstantial evidence led to the conclusion that the accused appellant calledaway the victims from their house, took them to the house of Barik Munshi wherethey died due to poison administered in their food. He pointed out that theevidence of P.W. 2 supports the prosecution case that when he went to the houseof Barik Munshi he saw the victims screaming and found the accused along withothers inside the house watching the victims screaming <span style='Courier New";'>""h¡yQ¡Jh¡yQ¡J''</span><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;Courier New"'>z </span></b><span style='Courier New";'></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;Courier New";'>Thereafter,he was chased away by the accused persons. </span></p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New";'>   We have considered thesubmissions of the learned Advocate-on-Record for the appellant and the learnedDeputy Attorney General for the Respondent and perused the impugned judgementof the High Court Division and other connected papers on record.  </p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New";Times New Roman";'>Uponscrutiny of the evidence we find that, according to the F.I.R. the occurrencetook place at 10:00 p.m.following 31.1.1995 and the F.I.R. was lodged at 9:30 a.m. on 01.02.1995. The informant stated in theF.I.R. that he heard from one Nabir Hossain that his sister Selina along withanother sister Rokeya and brother Abu Bakkar Siddique (Babul) were lying unconsciousin the house of Barik Munshi, he sent doctor Md. Wahiduzzaman, Serajul IslamHarmuj along with Lal Miah on a motorcycle to the place of occurrence. As P.W.1 the informant corroborated his statement as made in the F.I.R. We note thatthere was no mention by the informant that he informed his brother Helal Uddin(P.W.2) or that P.W.2 informed him about going to the house of Barik Munshi andfinding Selina, Rokeya and Abu Bakkar screaming for help and the accusedpersons watching them and, thereafter, chasing them. We cannot believe thatsuch an important fact and vivid description by P.W. 2 would not have beennarrated to his brother-the informant during the night of occurrence and wouldnot therefore be reflected in the F.I.R. If the informant is to be believedthen the first persons to reach the place of occurrence on his intimation wouldhave been Dr. Wahiduzzaman, Serajul Islam and Lal Miah who on their arrivalfound the victims dead. We also note that the prosecution has not examined Dr.Wahiduzzaman who in our view is a most relevant witness. P.W. 10 Nabir Hossainwho allegedly informed Jahangir, the informant (P.W.1) about the victims,stated in his deposition that having heard the news about someone beingpoisoned in Barik Munshi’s house he went to the place of occurrence and foundthe 3 persons lying in the Courtyard. Hence, it would appear that the victimshad already died even before Nabir Hossain reached the place of occurrence. Thefailure of the informant to mention anything about his brother P.W.2 HelalUddin, who claimed to have heard about the victims from his brother Jahangir(the informant), is clearly an embellishment. It is clear upon scrutiny of theevidence that Jahangir first heard about the occurrence from Nabir Hossain, whoreported the matter to the informant after visiting the place of occurrencewhere the victims had already died. Therefore, it is highly improbable thatupon hearing about the matter from Jahangir, Helal would go to the place ofoccurrence and find the victims alive and screaming for help. </p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New";Times New Roman";'>Withregard to the presence of the accused at the time of occurrence, P.W.5 BellalHossain stated that when he arrived on his motorcycle, the victims were alreadydead and upon hearing the sound of the motorcycle the accused persons fled.However from the cross-examination of the Investigating Officer( P.W.18) wefind that Bellal Hossain did not say to the Investigating Officer that theaccused persons escaped upon hearing the sound of the motorcycle. The presenceof Helal at the place of occurrence is introduced by Bellal Hossain (P.W.5) whostated in his deposition that Lal Miah (Lutfur Rahman Lal) (P.W.8) stated thatHelal is somewhere near and to search for him, but according to theInvestigating Officer, Lal Miah did not say so in his statement under section161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. </p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New";Times New Roman";'>Withregard to the application of the concept “last seen”, learned D.A.G. submittedthat the fact of calling and taking away by the accused appellant is proved bythe evidence of prosecution witnesses, we find from the evidence of the InvestigatingOfficer (P.W.17) that Sarmin (P.W. 9) did not tell him that the appellantcalled and took away the three victims. In any event even if it is proved thatthe appellant called the victims away and was seen in his company going towardsthe house of Barik Munshi, when he arrived there and is found in the presence ofothers in the house of Barik Munshi, which is admitted by the prosecution, hisexclusive responsibility to explain what happened to the victims ends. Thechain of circumstances is thus broken. What happened in the house of BarikMunshi where persons other than the appellant were also present is for BarikMunshi to explain. </p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New";Times New Roman";'>Inthe facts and circumstances discussed above, we find that the prosecution didnot prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and, accordingly, heis found not guilty of the offence as charged. </p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New";'><span style='Courier New";'>Accordingly,t</span><span style='Courier New";Arial Unicode MS"'>he criminal appeal is allowed.
