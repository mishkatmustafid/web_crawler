Aftab Hossain, Advocate-on-Record-For the Respondent No. 1.Not Rep­resented-Respondent No. 2.<br/><br/><strong>Civil Appeal No. 168 of 2002</strong><br/>(From the judgment and order dated 28th June, 1999 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 3737 of 1995).<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Judgment</strong></span><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mohammad Fazlul Karim J.</strong> - This Appeal, by leave, is directed against the impugned judgment and order dated 28.06.1999 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 3737 of 1995 making the Rule absolute setting aside the judgment and decree dated 23.05.1995 passed by the Subordinate Judge, 2nd Court of Zilla Rajbari in Title Appeal No. 57 of 1993 reversing those of the Assistant Judge, Pangsa, Rajbari, dated 28.04.1993 in Title Suit No. 44 of 1985 dismissing the same.<br/><br/>2. The leave petitioner filed the Title Suit No. 44 of 1985 before the Assistant Judge, Pangsa, Rajbari, seeking for a decree of specific performance of contract for sale of the land measuring,an area of 1.22 acres stating, inter alia, that the respondent (defendant No. 1) proposed to sell the land described in the schedule of the plaint for a consideration of Tk. 3,000.00 and there­upon executed a kabala in fabour of the petitioner on receiving the entire consider­ation money but the defendant-respon­dent  No. 1 on different pretexts delayed the registration of the kabala and finally on  30.07.1975  refused to register the same. Hence the suit was filed.<br/><br/>3. The defendant-respondent contested the suit by filing written statement denying all the averments made in the plaint stating, inter alia, that the suit is not maintainable. It is barred by limitation and also barred by the principles of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence. His specific case, in short, is that on account of urgent necessity (of) money, the defendant approached the plaintiff for loan of an amount of Tk. 3,000.00 in the month of Jaishstha, 1379 B.S. and the plaintiff agreed to give him loan on condition that the defendant would make over possession and give the title deeds of the suit land to him as secu­rity of loan. Accordingly an amount of Tk. 3,000.00 was received by the defendant in the month of Jaishstha, 1379 B.S. after making over possession of the suit land. There was no contract with the plaintiff that the defendant would sell the suit land as stated in the plaint. The defendant never received consideration as the price of the land nor the defendant executed any kabala deed in favour of the plaintiff on receipt of such consideration but the kabala deed as filed by the plaintiff is forged. There being no contract of sale between the plaintiff and defendant No. 1, question of specific performance dose not arises at all. In such circumstances the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>4. The leave was granted to consider the submissions of the learned Advocate of the petitioner that "the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division erred in law in discarding the evidence of the plaintiff in spite of clear proof of the facts regarding talk of sale of the suit land, delivery of possession, receipt of consid­eration money and the execution of the sale deed and thereby arrived at an erro­neous decision. In such view of the matter the impugned judgment of the High Court Division is liable to be set aside and the judgment and decree of the appellate Court should be restored. It is further con­tended that the High Court Division hav­ing misread the provision of Section 45 of the Evidence Act committed error of law in setting aside the judgment of the appel­late Court. Filing additional ground that the learned advocate submits that the High Court Division erred in law in not sending the case on remand to the appellate Court for writing proper judgment in accordance with law in view of the above facts and circumstance of the case."<br/><br/>5. Md. Serajul Huq, learned Advocate, appearing for the appellants submits that the High Court Division erred in law in discarding the evidence of the plaintiff in spite of clear proof of the facts as to talk of sale of the suit land, delivery of posses­sion, receipt of the consideration money and execution of the sale deed and arrived at an erroneous decision. The High Court Division as well erred in law in disbeliev­ing the evidence of P.W. 1 and P.W. 2 Mohammad Mollah in whose presence the sale deed was executed and also the evi­dence of P.W. 3, Bishnu Pada Saha, the scriber of the deed and the evidence of those P.Ws are admissible in Evidence Act and that the decree of the specific per­formance of contract allowed by the Subordinate Judge, after considering the material evidence on record.<br/><br/>6. The learned Advocate further submits that the High Court Division erred in law in ignoring the fact of the title deed of the suit land and the executed kabala for sale were produced from the custody of the plaintiff and admittedly the defendant No. 1   received Tk. 3,000.00 from the plaintiff and as such the findings of the High Court Division are erroneous and not tenable in law; that the High Court Division failed to consider that admittedly possession of the suit land was delivered to the plaintiff who has been in possession of the land in pursuance of the contract for sale and there is not a single piece of evi­dence that the defendant repaid the loan amount to the plaintiff and as not the finding of the High Court Division is contrary to the evidence and the materials on record and has committed a gross error of law in reversing the materials facts of the suit having been proved by cogent evidence.<br/><br/>7. Lastly, the learned Advocate submits that the High Court Division erred in law in not sending the case on remand to the appellate Court for writing a proper judgment after discussing the evidence of P.Ws in its proper prospective in spite of the fact that the plaintiff proved the payment of consideration money and delivery of title deeds and delivery of possession of the suit land and as such arrived at an erroneous decision.     <br/>                                    <br/>8. Mr. Md. Aftab Hossain, learned Advocate, appearing for the respondent No. 1 submits that the High Court Division has committed no error of law of fact in considering the evidence of the P.W.s and D.W.s while making the Rule absolute, He further submits that the High Court Division considered the scope of the suit for specific performance of contract and lawfully reverse of the learned Subordinate Judge and as such has committed no wrong in setting aside the decree passed by the learned Subordinate Judge while restoring those of the trial Court.<br/><br/>9. It appears from the record that the defendant has admitted receipt of Tk. 3,000.00 from the plaintiff as a loan and handed over the title deeds and made over possession of the land to the plaintiff as security of the loan so received by him but the plaintiff has failed to prove that he has received the said money on account of  sale though P.W.2 and 4 deposed in favour of the plaintiff case but they contradicted  P.W. 1 as regards the talk of sale drawing up of the deed of kabala and execution thereof. P.W. 4 as well conducted P.W. regarding payment of money on the date when the talk was held. The High Court Division noticed the contradictions hold­ing that the Court of Appeal below as the last (Court) of fact did not at all discuss the material evidence while reversing the judgment and decree of the trial Court on the view that defendant has failed to prove his case contrary to the established princi­ple of burden of proof that the plaintiff has to prove his own case. The Court of Appeal below has not reversed the finding regarding talk of sale, deposit of deed of kabala and execution thereof. But the trial Court arrived at a finding on consideration of the evidence on cogent ground has dis­believed the plaintiffs case of payment of sale money of the land after drawing of an execution kabala. It appears that the Court of Appeal below while decreeing approached the case on the wrong premis­es i.e. failure of the defendant to prove his case instead of whether the plaintiff has been able to prove his case or not. It appears that the trial Court dismissed the suit on assessment of the evidence of the parties and the High Court Division on proper appreciation of the evidence on record affirmed the judgment of the Court below while discarding the finding of the appellate Court which is neither based on any evidence nor on the established prin­ciple of proof.<br/><br/>10. In view of the above, we do not find any cogent reason to disagree with the impugned judgment of the High Court Division.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed without any order as to costs.<br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
