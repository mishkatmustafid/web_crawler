The suit was filed seeking declaration of title in the land in suit measuring 2.06 acres.<br/><br/>2. The suit was filed stating, inter alia, that the land in 'Ka' schedule belonged to Fuljan, that the land in 'Kha' schedule has been recorded in the name of Habil and others and he transferred his share in the 'Kha' schedule by a Heba-bil-Ewaz deed dated December 20,1956 to Kholsha Nessa Bibi and Fuljan Bibi, that Fuljan transferred 1.15 acres of land from 'Kha’ schedule and also transferred her entire share in ‘Ka’ schedule by deed of gift dated February 8, 1962 to the plaintiff, that pos­session was delivered to the plaintiff, that R.S. record in respect of 'Ka' schedule land was wrongly prepared in the name of Fuljan Bibi and that as regard the land of 'Kha' schedule R.S. record was wrongly prepared in the name of Habil and others, that Fuljan Bibi and Habil have no interest in the land of the said 'Ka' and 'Kha' sched­ule and that also they have no possession, that defendants having had denied the title of the plaintiff, he was constrained to file the suit.<br/><br/>3. The suit was contested by the defendant Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 5 by filing joint written statement denying the material averments made in the plaint and stating, inter alia, that Fuljan Bibi used to possess the land in suit through her husband Habil who died leaving brother's son, defendant Nos.4 and 5, that Fuljan Bibi was a pardanshin woman and she became ill in the middle of Magh, 1368 B.S. and the plaintiff visit­ed Fuljan Bibi at that time and proposed for her treatment and for that alleged pur­pose took Fuljan Bibi on 25th Magh, 1368 B.S.to Sailakupa and upon making repre­sentation that Fuljan Bibi's signature was necessary for her treatment took thumb impression on certain papers which were blank and upon using those papers the plaintiff had created the deed of gift, that Fuljan Bibi after death of her husband stayed with defendant Nos.4 and 5, that plaintiff has no title and possession in the land in suit, that the plaintiff disclosed about the deed on 8.2.1962 for the first time and thereupon claimed the land, that Fuljan Bibi cancelled the Heba-bil-Ewaz deed by another deed dated January 5, 1963, that Fuljan possessed the land through defendant Nos.4 and 5, that Fuljan transferred 91 decimals of land from plot No. 1596 by the kabala dated August 7,1965 to the defendant No. 1 and also transferred 1.79 acres of land from the 'Kha' schedule by the kabala dated March 28, 1967 to the defendant Nos.4 and 5, that the defendants are in posses­sion of the land in suit and as such the plaintiffs suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">4. The trial Court dismissed the suit on the finding that plaintiff miserably failed to establish his case and that he has no right, title, interest and possession in the land in suit.<br/><br/>5. On appeal the judgment and decree of the trial Court was affirmed on the finding that plaintiff failed to prove that on the basis of the Heba-bil-Ewaz deed dated February 10, 1962 he went into possession on the land in suit and that is in possession of the land in suit.<br/><br/>6. Thereupon the plaintiff moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction. The High Court Division discharged the Rule on the finding that the finding made by the Courts below as to that plaintiff has no title and possession in the land in suit is based on correct appreciation of the evi­dence on record and that finding so arrived at by the Courts below do not suf­fer from mis-reading or non-consideration of the evidence. It has been observed by the High Court Division that from the petitioner's side it was not pointed out that the findings and decisions of the Courts below were based on mis-reading or non-consideration of the evidence. The High Court Division has discharged the Rule on the finding that plaintiff being out of pos­session of the land in suit the suit framed was not maintainable and that in dismiss­ing the suit Courts below did not commit any error calling for interference by the High Court Division.<br/><br/>7. We have heard the learned Advocate and perused the materials in the record. It has concurrently been found by the appel­late Court as well as by the trial Court that plaintiff miserably failed to prove his pos­session in the land in suit. It may be men­tioned the suit was for mere declaration of title. Since the plaintiff failed to prove his possession in the land in Suit we are of the view High Court Division as well as the Courts below have correctly held that the suit was not maintainable. The learned Advocate for the petitioner could not point out that the finding so arrived at by the Court of facts suffers from any error or that the same has been made upon mis­reading or non-consideration of the evi­dence. Since the finding of fact arrived at by the Court of facts were based on cor­rect appreciation of the evidence or in other words was not bad for non-consider­ation or mis-reading of the evidence we are of the view the High Court Division has committed no error in not interfering with the judgment of the Court of appeal.<br/><br/>In that state of the matter we do not find any merit in the petition.<br/>Accordingly the petition is dismissed.</div>Ed.                       </div></div>
