Abdul Matin J.-</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 15.04.2008 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 477 of 2006 discharging the Rule aris­ing out of the judgment and decree dated 09.11.2005 passed by the learned District Judge, Meherpur in Title Appeal No.152 of 2001 allowing the appeal and reversing those dated 09.10.2001 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 1st Court, Meherpur in Title Suit No. 3 of 1999 decree­ing the suit on contest.<br/><br/>2. The facts, in short, are that the petitioner as plaintiff instituted a suit for specific per­formance of contract on 06.09.1999 against the respondent Nos.1 and 2 before the 1st Court of learned Joint District Judge, Meherpur being Title Suit No.3 of 1999 which was decreed on contest. Against that a Title Appeal No.152 of 2001 was pre­ferred by the opposite party No. 2 only and the learned appellate court allowed the appeal by judgment and decree dated 09.10.2005 by setting aside the aforesaid judgment and decree of the trial court.<br/><br/>3. The case of the plaintiff petitioner, in short, is that the suit land measuring about 23.50 decimals with other lands of total area 71 decimals situated within <em>mouza</em> Amjhupi P.S. and District-Meherpur, S.A. <em>Khatian </em>No. 158, dag No. 1796 owned and possessed by Niamat Uddin Sheikh, Zasimuddin Sheikh and Motahar Ali Sheikh and accord­ingly their names were duly recorded in S.A. <em>Khatian</em> No.158. The father of the defendant Nos.1 and 2 purchased the suit land from the heirs of the aforesaid Motaher Ali in favour of the defendant Nos.1 and 2 vide deed No.5572 dated 10.08.1994. As the defendant Nos.1 and 2 were minors so they were possessing the suit land through their father and guardian Shajahan. At one stage that Shajahan decided to sell the suit land for the purpose of sending the defen­dant No.1 abroad and other benefits of the minors.<br/><br/>4. The defendant Nos.1 and 2 through their father and natural guardian had to decide to sell the suit land as above and accordingly the plaintiff agreed to purchase the same. The consideration was fixed at Tk. 1,20,000/- and accordingly an agree­ment was signed on 29.12.1994. The father of the defendant Nos.1 and 2 Md. Shajahan signed the agreement on behalf of the minors for the benefit of the minor and received Tk. 30,000/- as advance money on the date of signing the agreement on 29.12.1984. There was a condition that the plaintiff might pay Tk.50,000/- from the rest of the amount within a week and the rest will be paid within 3 years from the date of signing the agreement. Subsequently on behalf of the minor defendants, their father Md. Shajahan took Tk. 50,000/- on 05.01.1995 and Tk. 40,000/- on 01.12.1997 endorsing the same on the back side of the<em> bainapatra</em>. Thus they received the entire amount of consideration money of Tk. 1,20,000/- and they also handed over the original deed to the plaintiff and also hand­ed over the major portion of the suit land. Thereafter the defendants did not execute the sale deed in time in spite of repeated requests and as such the plaintiff served a legal notice through regd. post on 13.05.1999 requesting them to execute the sale deed within 30.05.1999 but the defen­dants did not respond to the said notice. The plaintiff again served another notice on 01.08.1999 requesting them to execute the sale deed on or before 08.08.1999. But the said notice was refused by them and finally they refused to execute the sale deed. As a result, the plaintiff was compelled to file the aforesaid suit for specific performance of contract on 06.09.1999 with a prayer for execution and registration of sale deed and for the compensation at the rate of Tk. 1,000/- per day till the execution and registration of sale deed.<br/><br/>5. On receiving the notice the father of the defendant Nos.1 and 2 Md. Shajahan con­tested the suit on behalf of the defendant No.2 only by filing a written statement stat­ing, <em>inter alia</em>, that the defendant Nos.1 and 2 are the owners of the suit land by purchase through him. At one stage the defendant No.1 through his father Shajahan for the purpose of going abroad took loan of Tk. 25,000/- from the plaintiff on condition of giving him interest of Tk. 5,000/-. Subsequently he deposited the original deed on behalf of the plaintiff as surety of the loan amount. Thereafter he returned back the aforesaid Tk. 30,000/- to the plaintiff. He also claimed for dismissal of the suit etc.<br/><br/>6. The defendant No.1 neither contested the suit through his aforesaid father nor by him­self in spite of receiving the notice through his father and guardian during his minority and subsequently he attained majority dur­ing the pendency of the suit and the plaint was amended accordingly and in that situa­tion also he did not contest the suit knowing everything from his father and by himself.<br/><br/>7. The trial court decreed the suit and on appeal the appellate court set aside the judg­ment and decree of the trial court and in revision the High Court Division discharged the Rule.<br/><br/>8. As against the judgment and order of the High Court Division the petitioner has filed this petition for leave to appeal.<br/><br/>9. Heard Mr. Asad Hossain Chowdhury, the learned Advocate appearing for the petition­er and Mr. A. K. M. Shahidul Huq, the learned Advocate-on-Record appearing for the respondents and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/><br/>10. It appears that the High Court Division rightly found that the contract was against the interest of the minors and the same was not proved. The High Court Division fur­ther found that though the plaint was amended but no summons was served upon the defendant and in such circumstances the High Court Division rightly affirmed the judgment of the appellate court which was the last court of fact.<br/>We find no substance in this petition which is accordingly dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
