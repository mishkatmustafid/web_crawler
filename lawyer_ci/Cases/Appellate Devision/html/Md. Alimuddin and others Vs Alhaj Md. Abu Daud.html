Abdul Matin J.-</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 16.04.2009 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.4896 of 2007 discharging the Rule and affirming the judgment and decree dated 24.06.2007 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 1st Court, Gazipur in Title Appeal No.93 of 2004 dismissing the appeal and affirming the judgment and decree dated 29.04.2004 passed by the learned Senior Assistant Judge, 1st Court, Gazipur in Title Suit No. 230 of 2001 decreeing the suit.<br/><br/>2. The facts, in short, are that the respon­dent as plaintiff filed Title Suit No. 230 of 2001 against the petitioners as defendants before the learned Senior Assistant Judge, 1st Court, Gazipur praying for decree of permanent injunction. The defendant-peti­tioners appeared before the trial court and contested the suit by filing written state­ment.<br/> </div><div>3. The plaintiff’s case, in brief, is that Kefatullah and Esamuddin were the own­ers of the suit land including other lands. By amicable partition Esamuddin and Kefatullah got 1.32½ acres of land each. Kefatullah got 22 decimals of land from old plot No.247 and 132.50 acres from old plot No.246. Kefatullah constructed house in the land of plot No.247 and his name was correctly recorded in S.A. and R.S. <em>Khatian</em>. Thereafter Kefatullah died leav­ing behind 3 sons with plaintiff and daughter Joymon and one grandson. The plaintiff had been servicing in Natore District for a long time. Defendant's father Ramzan Ali was the elder brother of plaintiffs and Ramzan Ali was the caretaker of the plaintiffs land and all title documents of the plaintiffs land was with Ramzan Ali. After, the death of plaintiff’s father plaintiff came to suit land and constructed some shops and has been living there since 1990. The plaintiff gave a legal notice to his elder brother on 30.01.1998 and for this Ramzan Ali gave possession to plaintiff on 3 4¾ decimals of land. Thus the plaintiffs acquired possession of land measuring 11½ decimals of land in old plot No. 246 and are possessing the suit land constructing dwelling house and shops and the defendants with 5-6 persons tried to enter and dispossess the plaintiff on 05.09.2001. The defendants are law break­ers as well as powerful with sufficient manpower. They may dispossess the plaintiff from the suit land at any time.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">4. The defendant Nos. 1-4 (petitioner here­in) submitted a written statement denying all material allegations by the plaintiff made in the plaint and stated <em>inter-alia</em> that the suit is not maintainable in its pres­ent form and manner and there is no cause of action to file the suit. Kefatullah bought 2.65 acres of land including suit land in C.S. Plot Nos.246 and 247. Kefatullah has been living in some portion of land in plot No. 247 by constructing dwelling house. He also has been possessing the remaining land of plot No. 247 and also the land of plot No. 246 growing crops and enjoying them. Kefatullah executed a <em>heba-bil-ewaz</em> deed in favour of his grand sons named Shahidullah, Amanullah and Habibullah on 16.09.1997 bearing deed No. 9167 regarding .26 ½ acre of land in the middle of the C.S. Plot No.246 and he also transferred .66 acres of land in C.S. Plot No. 246 to his son Ramzan Ali on 16.09.1975 by executing a <em>heba-bil-ewaz </em>deed No.9168. As per that deed the vendees acquired possession over 921A acres of land in plot No.246. Kefatullah died leaving behind 3 sons named Ramzan Ali, Azam Ali and plaintiff Abu Daud and one daughter Joymannessa and 3 grand sons Shahidullah, Amanullah, Habibullah and 2 daughters Ahjiron and Latifa in the year 1976. Kefatullah's daughter Joyman Bibi sold her total land to Ramjan Ali on 28.07.1980 by executing a sale deed No.5660. Azam transferred his 12 deci­mals of land to his brother's sons named Alimuddin and Awlad Hossain on 18.02.1985 by executing a <em>heba-bil-ewaz</em> deed No. 2009. Thereafter Ramjan Ali exe­cuted 2 <em>heba</em> deeds in favour of his two sons named Abdul Baten and Osman Gani on 08.12.1996 bearing <em>hiba</em> deed Nos. 13623 and 19624 measuring 12 deci­mals of land. Thereafter Ramjan Ali died leaving behind 4 sons named Abdul Baten, Osman Gani, Awlad Hossain and Alimuddin on 17.04.2000. The plaintiff went to Natore of Rajshahi in the year 1952/53 and married there. The plaintiff Abu Daud tried to come back to his father's house in the year 1965. But his father prevented him from coming back. Thereafter Abu Daud proposed his brother Ramjan Ali to purchase some land in Rajshahi and Ramjan Ali sold .73 acre of land in plot No.231 and gave the sale pro­ceeds to his brother Abu Daud to purchase some land in Rajshahi in the name of Ramjan Ali but Abu Daud bought 1.61 acres of land in Natore Rajshahi or 11.06.1966 bearing sale deed No.6494 in the name of Ramjan Ali and Abu Daud instead of Ramjan Ali. Their names were recorded in the R.S. <em>Khatian</em> No.528 Ramjan Ali exchanged his land of Rajshahi with that of his brother Abu Daud by receiving 22 decimals of land from Mirpur mauja. Thereafter before executing partition deed or exchange deed the 3rd party dispossessed Ramjan Ali from 6½ decimals of land in plot No.246. So Ramjan Ali called Abu Daud to file suit regarding 6½ decimals of land and plain­tiff Abu Daud and Ramjan Ali filed Title Suit No. 18 of 1996 which was renum­bered as 99 of 1997 and got decree. For maintaining the suit Ramjan Ali gave ver­bal possession to plaintiff in his one house to live which was constructed by Kefatullah, Ramjan Ali died on 17.04.2000 without any title. The defen­dants obtained plan from 05.09.1989 and 22.03.1995 in .84 decimals of land from the Chairman of the Konabari Union <em>Parishad</em>. The defendants constructed Ranu Super Market on 84 decimals of land including suit land. The suit land is the part of 66 decimals of land which land was transferred by Kefatullah to Ramjan Ali by executing <em>hiba-bil-ewaz</em> deed No.9168. So plaintiff Abu Daud did not acquire any land in 66 decimals of land. The plaintiff has no title and possession over the suit land. So he has no <em>locus standi</em> to file a suit for permanent injunction. So the suit is liable to be dismissed with cost.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">5. The suit was decreed by the trial court and the appellate court also upheld the same and the High Court Division sitting on revision also discharged the Rule.<br/><br/>6. Having lost in all the courts the petition­ers have filed this petition for leave to appeal.<br/><br/>7. Heard Mr. A. S. M. Khalekuzzaman, the learned Advocate-on-Record appearing for the petitioners placed the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/><br/>8. It appears that both the trial court and the court of appeal below concurrently found that the plaintiff has been in posses­sion of the suit land and the defendant petitioners admitted his possession in the suit land and in view of such finding, the High Court Division rightly held that there was no illegality in decreeing the suit.<br/><br/>We find no substance in this petition which is accordingly dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
