Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 instituted Title Suit No. 87 of 2000 in the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Sundargonj, Gaibandha, for specific performance of contract in respect of the suit land. The plaintiffs case, inter alia, is that the defendant's father Obaidul Haque was the owner in possession in the suit property, who pro­posed to sell the said land the plaintiffs. On 15th April, 1995 said Obaidul Haque executed a deed of agreement on receipt of Tk. 25,000/-(Taka twenty five thousand) out of total consideration of Tk. 34,500/- (Taka thirty four thousand five hundred). It had been stipulated therein that he would execute a sale deed in favour of the plaintiffs on receipt of the balance amount after mutating the suit property. As per terms of the agreement the plaintiffs requested in January, 2000 to execute and register the sale deed but the defendant with some false pleas took time and finally on 1st April, 2009, the defendant refused to execute and register the sale deed.<br/><br/>3. The petitioner contested the suit by fil­ing a written statement denying the mate­rial allegations made in the plaint. His case is that he did not execute any agree­ment for sale of the suit land as alleged in the plaint and that the plaintiffs taking advantage of his illiteracy created a collu­sive deed. As a matter of fact, he executed a deed of mortgage at a consideration of Tk. 25,000/-. The suit is, therefore, liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>4.  The trial court on consideration of the evidence on record by judgment and order dated 26th February, 2003 dismissed the suit directing the defendant No. 2 to refund Tk. 25,000/- to the plaintiffs within 180 days from the date of judgment, in default of which, the suit stands decreed. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and decree, the respondent Nos.1 and 2 pre­ferred Other Class Appeal No. 50 of 2003 before the District Judge, Gaibandha which on transfer was heard by the learned Joint District Judge, 2nd Court, Gaibandha, who by judgment and order dated 17th July, 2004 allowed the appeal and decreed the suit with a direction upon the petitioner to execute and register a sale deed  within 60 days on receipt of Tk. 9,500/-. The petitioner thereupon moved the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 3710 of 2004. A Single Bench of the High Court Division by judgment and order dated 18th May, 2008 discharged the rule and affirmed those of the court of appeal below.<br/><br/>5. It is contended on behalf of the petition­er that the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division erred in law in maintaining the decree for specific perform­ance in failing to consider that the transac­tion between the parties is not an agree­ment for sale of the suit land, rather it is an out and out mortgage and thus the suit as framed is not legally maintainable.<br/><br/>6. The court of appeal below on a proper consideration of the agreement, exhibit 1, came to a specific finding that the defen­dant-petitioner's predecessor Md. Obaidul Huq executed the deed of agreement on receipt of Tk.25,000/- and thus the peti­tioner is bound to execute and register a sale deed. The learned Single Judge of the High Court Division affirmed this finding of fact.<br/><br/>7. The learned Advocate-on-Record appearing for the petitioner has failed to point out any error of law in judgment of the High Court Division in not interfering with the judgment of the court of appeal below. Considering the facts and circum­stances of the matter, we find no merit in this petition, which is accordingly dis­missed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
