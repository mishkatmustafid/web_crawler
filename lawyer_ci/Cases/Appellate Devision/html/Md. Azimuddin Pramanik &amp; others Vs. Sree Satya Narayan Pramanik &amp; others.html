This arises from Miscellaneous Case No.167 of 1978 in the Court of Munsif, Natore. The land in question was trans­ferred by a kabala dated 29 July, 1976 to the appellants Nos.1 to 4; they are co-sharers of the vendor (respondent No. 2) in the tenancy by purchase. Respondent No.1 is a tenant having land contiguous to the land transferred. He filed the Miscellaneous Case seeking pre-emption of the land under section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tena­ncy Act. His claim was resisted by the appellants-transferees on the ground that their claim being higher in order of preference than that of the contiguous land­holder, the latter is not entitled to pre-emption. This contention was accepted by the learned Munsif who refused pre-emption. But on appeal the learned District Judge took the view that the transfer to a co-sharer by purchase is pre-emptible and that as the transferees, though co-sharers by purchase, did not join in the application for pre-emption, the contiguous land-holder is entitled to pre-empt the land, and on this view allowed the pre-emption. His deci­sion was upheld by the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division at Rangpur by the impugned order dated 6 July 1983 in Civil Revision Case No. 22 of 1983. Leave was granted by us to consider whether the pre-emption has been allowed on correct interpretation of section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act.<br/><br/>3. There is no dispute that a transfer to a co-sharer by purchase is pre-emptible, but the question is whether it is pre-­emptible by a contiguous land holder. The learned Single Judge took the view that in this case the co-sharers by purchase namely, the appellants-transferees, did not join with the pre-emptor, contiguous land-holder, in the application for pre-emption, and as such, the latter is entitled to pre-empt the trans­fer made to the appellants-co-sharers. The learned Single Judge relied upon sub-section (4) of section 96 which provides for a co-sharer-transferee joining in an   application for pre-emption already filed. But this sub­section, must be read and considered along with other provisions of section 96 parti­cularly, sub-sections (2) and (5) Sub-section (2) Provides that in an application for pre­emption by a co-sharer tenant, all  other co-sharer tenants shall be made parties; a contiguous laud-holder is not a necessary party there. But if an application for pre­emption is made by a contiguous laud-holder, all the co-sharer-tenants (whether by inheri­tance or by   purchase) and also all other, tenants holding lauds contiguous to the, land transferred, shall be made parties. This distinction between a co-sharer tenant and a tenant having the contiguous land has been again pronounced in definite terms and   language in subjection (5). This sub section has set forth the prior rights to purchase under section 96 it is quoted below:<br/>‘‘(5) (a): If (i) a co-sharer tenant whose interest has accrued by inheritance and (ii) a co-sharer tenant whose interest has accrued by purchase and (iii) a tenant holding land contiguous to the land transferred apply under this section and comply with the provisions herein con­tained the applicant or applicants shall have the prior right to purchase under this section in the order in which they have been mentioned   above.”<br/>As appears clearly from sub-section 5 (i) (a), a co-sharer by inheritance gets the first priority and if he claims per-emption he will exclude all other claimants. If a co-sharer by purchase claims pre-emption, the claim of a contiguous land-holder stands superseded. Now in the instant case, the co-sharers by purchase already purchased the land, and no other co-sharer has come forward claiming pre-emption. The learned Single Judge obser­ved that these co-sharer-transferees were required to claim pre-emption by joining in the application of the contiguous land-holder, but the learned Single Judge did not notice that even if these transferees had joined in the application for pre-emption the claim of the contiguous land-holder would have fallen through straightaway. It appears that the appellants-transferees are the only co-sharers in the holding, and it is they who already pur­chased the land. Since there was no other co-sharer in the holding, transfer to the appellants is immune from pre-emption by a contiguous land-holder, by necessary implication.<br/><br/>4. In this connection sub-section (10) of section 96 should be referred to. This pro­vides that a transfer to a co-sharer in the tenancy whose interest has accrued otherwise than by purchase, such as, by inheritance, is not pre-emptible. This means, all other co-sharers by inheritance will be debarred from pre-emption by this sub-sec. (10). But in the case of transfer to a co-sharer by purchases, it is not so protected, from pre-emption and any other co-sharer, whether by purchase or by inheri­tance, may claim pre-emption. But it does not mean that pre-emption may be claimed by a contiguous land-holder when the laud has been transferred to a co- sharer by purchase.<br/>The appellants need not have joined the pre-emptor-respondent, because to join in the application for pre-emption filed by a conti­guous land-holder is unnecessary.<br/><br/>5. The learned Single Judge has relied upon the case of <strong><em>Yakub Ali Mondal V Akhter Ali Mandal 6 DLR 130 </em></strong>in which it was held that transfer to a co-sharer by purchase is pre­emptible. This proposition is not disputed; secondly, that case was-decided under section 26F of the Bengal Tenancy Act which limited pre-emption to co-sharers only, either by purchase or by inheritance; it did not  extend the right of pre-emption to a tenant having land contiguous to the land transferred. As such the decision relied upon is of no assistance to the instant case where the claim of a contiguous land-holder is involved. The contiguous land­holder comes to the picture only when the co-sharer-tenants neither purchased the land nor claimed it by way of pre-emption but the land is sold to a stranger. Had, in the instant case, pre-emption been sought by a co-sharer by purchase, it would have been incumbent upon the co-sharer-transferee to apply to join in the application for rateable pre-emption. Reading section 96 as a whole it is found that if a land has been transferred to a co-sharer and when no other co-sharer has claimed pre-emption, the transfer is immune, by necessary implica­tion, to a pre-emption, by a contiguous land­holder. The question raised is found to have been correctly answered by the learned Munsif. 6. In the result, the appeal is allowed. The impugned order of the High Court Divi­sion is set aside and that of the trial court is restored. No order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
