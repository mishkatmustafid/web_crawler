In the instant case the trial court passed an order of status-quo which the defendants disobeyed and raised construction on the suit land. The trial court upon an application and on the report of the Advocate commissioner passed the impugned order in the form of temporary mandatory injunction for demolition of the said structure and restore the suit property to its original position when the order of status-quo was passed. The Appellate Division upheld that the court is competent to pass such an order under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure. </strong></div> <br/><strong><em>Cases Referred To-</em></strong><br/>Babul Kanti Das and others Vs.

Appellant instituted Title Suit No.1 of 1996 against the respondents for partition of the suit lands and allotment of a saham of .50 acres of land out of .68 acres of land of plot No. 889 of <em>khatian</em> No. 326 under mouja Chandgram, Police Station Beanibazar, District Sylhet. Plaintiffs case in short, is that the suit lands are the<em> ejmali</em> property of the appellant and the respondents. After the institution of the suit the appellant filed an application for temporary injunction restraining the respondents No. 1 and 2 from making any construction and / or changing the nature and character of the suit lands or from cutting away trees from the suit lands. The respondents No. 1 and 2 resisted the prayer for temporary injunction by filing a written objection. The trial Court made an interim order of status quo on 6th January, 1996 and upon hearing the parties the trial Court by judgment and order dated 20th March, 1997 directed the respondents No.1 and 2 to maintain status-quo in respect of the suit lands. The respondents did not challenge the said order in the appellate forum. Thereafter the appellant filed an application under section 55 of the Specific Relief Act for mandatory injunction stating, <em>inter alia,</em> that after the order of <em>status quo</em> made by the trial Court on 6th January, 1996, the respondents hastily started construction of permanent and temporary houses. Over and above, they had also dug up a ditch measuring 7 ft. length 7 ft. breath and 3 ft. depth and thereby created obstruction in the movement of the plaintiff-appellant.<br/><br/>3. The respondents No.1 and 2 filed a written objection against the application for mandatory injunction claiming that the plaintiff has no possession in the suit lands, that the respondents having faced with acute shortage of accommodation in their house raised the constructions in an area of .04 acres of land and that they did not violate the order of the Court by raising such constructions.<br/><br/>4. The learned Subordinate Judge upon hearing the parties by judgment and order dated 29th April, 1997 allowed the application for mandatory injunction on the reasonings that a local inspection was held wherein the Advocate Commissioner reported that the respondents No.1 and 2 had started construction of a house towards 3 ft. west of the  appellant's  house,  and thereafter the Second Advocate Commissioner reported that the respondents had already completed the house and they had started a construction of a new one and they also dug up a ditch towards the north­western corner and thereby they made the constructions in utter violation of the Court's order and accordingly, directed the respondents to remove the said constructions within 15 days at their own cost, failing which, it was directed that the plaintiff-appellant would be able to remove the constructions through the process of the Court.<br/><br/>5. The respondents preferred an appeal being Miscellaneous Appeal No.35 of 1997 from the said judgment and order of the learned Subordinate Judge. The learned Additional District Judge, 3rd Court, Sylhet heard the said appeal and by judgment and order dated 16th March, 1997 maintained the order of the learned Subordinate Judge with clear observations that the respondents made the constructions by flouting the <em>status quo</em> order and that the learned Subordinate Judge  was perfectly justified in directing for the demolition of the constructions.<br/><br/>6. The respondents being aggrieved by the said order moved the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 1221 of 1999. A Single Bench of the High Court Division by judgment and order dated 24th March, 2002  made  the rule absolute and set aside those of the Courts below on the reasoning that admittedly the respondents raised two huts on the land over which they were in possession after the order of status-quo, that the Courts below did not find that such structures are obstructing the passage of the plaintiff-appellant in any way, that since the respondents being co-sharers in specific possession are equally entitled to enjoy the lands which they are in occupation in the manner they thought best till the disposal of the suit and that no co-sharer should be restrained by an order of injunction for making construction for accommodation when such co-sharer made such constructions at his own risk and peril.<br/><br/>7. It was urged on behalf of the appellant that the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division erred in law in interfering with the concurrent findings of the Courts below relying on the principle of doctrine of necessity in failing to notice that the respondent raised the constructions without prior permission of the Court in utter violation of the Court's order and thereby they had flouted the authority of the Court.<br/><br/>8. Admittedly the respondents raised the constructions after order of <em>status quo</em> passed by the learned Subordinate Judge. They did not prefer any appeal if they were at all aggrieved by the order of <em>status quo</em> being co-sharer of the suit lands. They also did not seek any permission from the Courts below to raise the constructions since they had been facing shortage of accommodation as claimed on giving undertaking to remove the structures if the suit was decreed. In the premises, the learned Judge of the High Court Division has committed a fundamental error in interfering with the order of the mandatory injunction on the reasoning as above. The observation of the learned Single Judge that none of the Courts below has found such constructions are obstructing the passage of the appellants in any way is based upon misconception of fact in that the appellants made specific allegation in their application that by reason of the constructions covering the vacant compound they had been facing inconvenience in the movement of the family members. On the prayer of the plaintiff the trial Court ascertained the violation of the order of status quo by appointing two Advocate Commissioners and made the order of demolition of the structures. No person to the litigation has any right or authority to flout the order of the Court and if such acts are allowed then the Courts authority will be undermined to the estimation of the public in general. What a Court of law is concerned with is that it should not permit anyone to poison the fountain of justice before it begins to flow.<br/><br/>9. The views of the learned Single Judge that no co-sharer should be restrained by an order of injunction from making any construction for accommodation if he makes such construction at his own risk and peril is based on misconception of law. It is now settled that a co-sharer in specific possession of his separate shares is entitled to seek protection from court to maintain his exclusive possession from the onslaught of the other co-sharer who got no possession in the particular share which is in plaintiff's exclusive possession. If the order of injunction is adversely affected, the respondents could have sought for permission to make the constructions at their risk and peril but they did not make such prayer before raising the constructors and despite passing of the order of <em>status quo</em>, they continued their illegal works which were found by two Advocate Commissioners in their local inspections.<br/><br/>10. Dr. Rafiqur Rahman argues that if the respondents have violated the order of injunction, the remedy of the appellant lies under Order 39 Rule 2(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure but the plaintiff-appellant instead of resorting to the said provision has filed the application under section 55 of the Specific Relief Act, and the courts below can not pass an order of demolition under section 55 of the Specific Relief Act.<br/><br/>11. True, disobedience of an order of injunction is a punishable offence under Rule 2(3) of Order 39 but this disobedience of an order of injunction or <em>status quo</em> is a civil contempt. Disobedience to an order of injunction or <em>status quo</em> made under Rule 1 or Rule 2 by doing something for a party's unadvantage entitles a Court under its inherent power to bring back that party to a position where it originally stood as if the order passed have not been contravened. Even if it is assumed that the Court made such order of restitution or restoration of the <em>status quo</em> <em>ante</em> as a consequence of the finding of guilt of disobedience, if there can be such a power, there can always be ancillary to it the power to make an interim order to the said effect subject to the final determination of the case. There are cases where a party raises constructions in violation of interim injunction and obstructs the right of way, the Court can order for demolishing the construction under section 151 C.P.C. In this case though the plaintiff-appellant filed the application under section 55 of the Specific Relief Act, the trial Court treated it as one under section 151 C.P.C. and rightly made the order of restoration of the status-quo ante as a consequence of the finding of guilt of disobedience. It was not the defendant's case that he had bonafide misconstrued the order and acted on that basis, could not be held to have wilfully and deliberately disobeyed the order; such a plea could obviously be urged only when it is proved that a party was in fact under a misapprehension as to the scope of the order, but this was never the plea of the defendant. Turning to the next point, we hold that though undoubtedly proceedings under order 39 rule 2(3) of the Code have a punitive effect, they are in substance designed to effect the enforcement of or to execute the order. This provision is in essence only the mode for the enforcement or effectuation of an order of injunction.<br/><br/>12. Almost similar fact arose in <em><strong>Babul Kanti Das and others Vs. Abul Hashem and others, 47 DLR (AD) = 14 BLD (AD) 242</strong></em>. In that case after filing the suit the plaintiff filed an application for temporary injunction to restrain the defendants from continuing constructions on the disputed land. The trial court issued a show cause notice and an order maintaining status quo till disposal of the application. On the prayers of the plaintiff three local inspections were held and the Advocate Commissioners reported that the defendant continued the constructions and casting roof was then complete. Thereafter on the application of the plaintiff the trial court ordered the defendant to pull off "within 20 days at their own costs that of the<em> pucca</em> constructions which they made from the stage at which the first Advocate Commissioner found". This order of the trial Court was maintained up to the Appellate Division. The Appellate Division while maintaining the order of mandatory injunction approved the views taken in <em><strong>Abdul Jalil Munshi Vs. Abu Bakar Siddique, 35 DLR (AD) 42</strong></em> as under:<br/>"if a party to a suit does an act to bring about a change in the state of things existing at the date of the suit or just prior to that date, in order to forestall a possible order of the court, the court may, in an appropriate case, in exercise of its inherent power, require the offending party, by issuing a temporary injunction in mandatory form to restore <em>status quo ante</em>."<br/><br/>13. The Appellate Division was further of the view that "this principle is in consonance with fair administration of justice and this power of making an order of mandatory injunction on an interlocutory application may be exercised irrespective of the merits of the main case as it is one of the main concerns of the Court of law to see that no one dares to interfere with the course of justice by presenting the Court with a <em>fait accompli</em>". Though this sort of dispute relates to private rights of the contending parties to the litigation but the higher courts termed it a new character and it turned into a matter concerning public policy relating to administration of justice.<br/><br/>14. Dr. Rafiqur Rahman finally submits that the constructions have in fact been made by the mother and sister of the appellant on their specific share of land against whom there is no order of <em>status quo</em>. Dr. Rahman is now trying to make out a third case before this Court which is nobody's case in the Courts below. The respondents in their written objection have admitted that they have raised constructions for their accommodation. In view of the above, we find no merit in the contention of Dr. Rahman. The learned Single Judge of the High Court Division fell in an error in interfering with the order of mandatory injunction despite the fact that the respondents  have made  the constructions and changed the nature and character of the suit lands in utter violation of the Court's order of <em>status quo</em> and such actions can not be encouraged.<br/><br/>15. The interference of the order of demolition by the High Court Division is unjustified and without jurisdiction.<br/><br/>16. The appeal is allowed with cost of Tk. 100/-. The judgment of the High Court Division is set aside and restored those of the Courts below.</div></div></div>
