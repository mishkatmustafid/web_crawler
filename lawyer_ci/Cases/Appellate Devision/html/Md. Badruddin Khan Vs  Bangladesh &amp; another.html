It was a suit for specific performance of contract and recovery of possession from the defendant No. 1 Aziza Bibi. The Govern­ment of Bangladesh and the Sub-Divisional Officer, Sadar (South), Mymensingh were impleaded as defendant Nos. 2 and 3. The plaintiff filed a suit contending that the suit land originally belonged to two sisters, namely Aziza Bibi and Hazera Bibi in equal shares and while they had been in possession of the same, Hazera Bibi sold her share of the suit land to Aziza Bibi by a registered sale deed dated 24.2.1970 and thus Aziza Bibi became 16 annas owner of the property. The said Aziza Bibi while in peaceful possession of the suit property contracted to sell the suit land, its building thereon to the plaintiff for a consideration, of Taka 12,000 and on receipt of the entire consideration money executed a Bainapatra in his favour on 15.1.71 and handed over the possession of the suit property to the plaintiff. It was stipulated that Aziza Bibi would execute the sale deed after obtaining Income Tax Clearance Certi­ficate. In early part of February, 1971 said Aziza Bibi left for Dhaka and she did not return to Mymensingh. As such the sale deed was not executed but the plaintiff continued to possess the suit land. Thereafter on 2.9.72 the Sub-Divisional Officer, Sadar (South), Mymensingh issued a notice upon the plaintiff to vacate the suit premises claim­ing it to be an abandoned property. His objection petition was rejected by the S.D.O. and the plaintiff brought Other Class Suit No. 103 of 1973 in the Court of Munsif, Mymensingh and filed an application for temporary injunction. The learned Munsif issued a show cause notice upon the respon­dents and the S.D.O. but notwithstanding the said show cause the plaintiff filed the suit for specific performance of contract and recovery of possession against the defendant.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">3. The Government of Bangladesh contested the suit contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the alleged Bainapatra was ante-dated and collusive and no consideration was passed that the suit property was abandoned pro­perty and that the same was declared as abandoned property under P.O. No. 16 of 1972.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">4. The Trial Court decreed the suit upon consideration of the evidence on record and directed defendant No. 1 Aziza Bibi to execute/register a kabala within 30 days failing which the plaintiff will be entitled to have a kabala through court upon filing of necessary certificate.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">5. The Government of Bangladesh preferr­ed First Appeal being F. A. No. 157 of 1976 before the High Court Division. In the meantime the plaintiff decree-holder filed execution case No. 30 of 1974 for execution and registration of the sale deed and accor­dingly the sale deed was executed and register­ed by the Court on 17.7.76 and delivery of possession of the property in suit was given by the Court on 9.11.76.<br/>Be it noted that the appellant, Govern­ment of Bangladesh did not obtain any stay order from the High Court Division after the said appeal.<br/><br/>6. The records show that no one appear­ed for the plaintiff respondent in the High Court Division. The reason for non-appea­rance is detailed in paragraph 7 of the leave petition. The High Court Division reassessed the evidence in F.A. and took the view that the suit ought not to have been decreed by the Trial Court and accordingly allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit.<br/><br/>7. Mr. T. H. Khan,  the learned Counsel appearing  for the plaintiff appellant contend­ed that the High Court Division erroneously reversed the judgment of the trial Court and found   fault with the plaintiff on certain points which could easily be clarified, had the petitioner been represented at the hearing by an advocate. For instance, the High Court Division questioned the genuineness of the Bainapatra and the signature thereof and concluded "so from the evidence adduced by the plaintiff nobody was a witness to the defendant No. 1 signing the document Ext. 1, the Bainapatra". Then High Court Division considered as to why the husband of defen­dant No. 1 was not a witness in the document. The High Court Division took exception as to why certified copy of the deed of purchase by Aziza Bibi, defendant No. 1 from her sister Hazera Bibi was produced and why the original kabala was not produced. Then the High Court Division considered that the Municipal Tax was paid by both Hazera Bibi and Aziza Bibi and Ext. 3 shows that tax was paid upto March, 1972. If Aziza Bibi pur­chased the entire property taxes should have been paid only by Aziza Bibi and not by her sister Hazera Bibi and the High Court Divi­sion further considered that the payment of Municipal taxes does not prove that the plaintiff was in possession asserting her own right. On the same reasoning the High Court Division Ignored the electric bills, etc. The High Court Division considered that Aziza Bibi signed her name in Urdu and no other document was produced to prove the signature in the Bainapatra as the signature of Aziza Bibi. Pointing to these circumstances Mr. T. H. Khan argued that the reassessment of evidence by the High Court Division was not in accordance with law and well-settled principles and the judgment of reversal suffers from defect which warrants close examination by this Court.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">8. Mr. T. H. Khan appearing for the appellant placed judgment of the Trial Court before us and drew our attention to the passage as under: </div><div style="text-align: justify;">"On the other hand, the contesting defendant No. 2 examined only one witness, who is D. W. 1, Md. Reazuddin, an assistant in the abandoned property section of Mymensingh Collectorate. He could not prove any fact re­lating to the contract. He, however, stated that the Government took over possession of the property after an enquiry by Circle Officer. But those papers and enquiry reports have not been called for by the contesting defen­dant in this case and we are still in dark about the finding of the enquiry by C.O. and the grounds under which the plaintiff was evicted from the suit premises". <br/><br/>9. It thus appears that the very conten­tion that the property has been declared as abandoned property was not substantiated. The admitted position is that the plaintiff appellant was in possession of the suit pro­perty althrough. Next, the relationship between the parties, namely, the two sisters have completed the transaction, amongst others, by, Bainapatra which was accepted by the trial court but disbelieved by the High Court Division in appeal. The trial court placed its reliance on a registered kabala, Ext. 2, by which Aziza Bibi purchased half share in the suit premises from her sister Hazera Bibi one year before the agreement in ques­tion for Tk. 6,000/- to come to the conclusion that the price of the suit properties cannot be termed as grossly inadequate. The High Court Division while assessing the evidence over-looked this broad feature of the case of the plaintiff. The conclusion of the High Court Division that the witnesses—P.Ws. 2, 3 and 4 could not be relied on to support the plaintiff's story of contract and payment of money pursuant thereto is rather unhappy. The plaintiff adduced 4 witnesses to prove his case of the execution of bainapatra. He himself deposed to say that the document had been executed by defendant No. 1. The learned Judges, however, took exception "because he did not say how defendant No. 1 signed it. Because she was behind the screen." It was considered that defendant No. 3 could not be relied on because in cross-examina­tion he stated that the husband of defendant No. 1 brought her signature in the bain­apatra nor reliance was placed on D. W. 4 who was an attesting witness because "he did not see the defendant No. 1 signing the deed of agreement, rather the husband of the defendant reported to the witness and others that defendant No. 1 signed the Bainapatra". P.W. 2 was the scribe. The High Court Division concluded: "So, from the evidence adduced by the plaintiff nobody was a wit­ness to the defendant No. 1 signing the document Ext. 1, the bainapatra". The learn­ed Judges expressed their doubt further because the husband of defendant No. 1 was not a witness to the document.<br/><br/>10. Now the view of the trial court may be noticed, Reliance was placed on the evidence of P.W. 3 Hayatullah. This witness was an employee of the plaintiff and defendant. No. 1's husband for last 20/21 years and acted as their motor driver. The trial court cautiously approached his eviden­ce and concluded "relationship of the parties may be interested in them but at the same time it cannot be denied that in normal cir­cumstances he would know about the contract and payment of consideration, as he was in confidence of both the parties from before." P.W. 4 Abdul Halim also stoutly denied the defence suggestion that the Bainapatra was collusive and ante-dated document. In con­sideration of evidence the trial court conclu­ded: <br/>"But here in this case, all the P. Ws. satisfactorily proved the execution of the same by defendant No. 1 and also the passing of consideration." <br/><br/>11. The trial court gave cogent reason for accepting the plaintiff's case because of their relationship and both parties migrated together from India soon after partition and jointly started a motor transport business and also resided together with their families in the same premises. There was no challen­ge that, the plaintiff and defendant No. 1 was living together. The suit was contes­ted by defendant No. 2 only, namely, the S.D.O., Sadar, Mymensingh. The defen­dant No. 3, Government of Bangladesh though filed a written statement did not file any vokalatnama and the written statement itself was not signed as required under Order 6 rule 14 C.P.C. which led the trial Court to believe that defendant No. 3 contested the suit "in a half hearted manner". When the plaintiff in support of his case adduced evidence and examined witnesses, it is not understood as to why comment was necessary by the learned Judges for not having examined the husband of defendant No. 1. The plaintiff brought the suit and defendant No. 1 was a party to the suit. The husband of defen­dant No. 1 could come and challenge if need be as to the authenticity or genuineness of the bainapatra, if the defendant was so intere­sted but she having not contested the suit, it does not appeal to reason as to why the non-examination of the husband of defendant No. 1 will operate against the plaintiff. Next, electric dues and the municipal taxes, Ext. 3 and 4 series, all show that the taxes were paid in the joint names of the two sisters namely, Hazera Bibi and Aziza Bibi. This has invoked the comment from the learned Judges that ''the Municipal receipt and ele­ctric bill, Ext. 3 and 4 did not prove the agreement or possession pursuant to the alleged agreement". How the Municipal receipt and the electric bills will prove the agreement is not clear. Ext. 3 is dated 23.3.72 and Ext. 4 Electric bill dated 10.5.72. Notice for eviction under P.O. No. 16 was issued on 2.9.72 Ext. 5. Whereupon the plain­tiff brought a suit for permanent injunction against defendant No. 2 in the Court of 1st Munsif in O. C. Suit No. 103 of 1972. That case was not even contested by the Govern­ment and by Ext. 7 the plaintiff filed an ob­jection in September, 1972 declaring the suit premises as an abandoned property though his prayer was rejected which prompted him to file this suit.<br/><br/>12. The trial court decreed the suit on evidence and the decision primarily rests on facts. In reversing the judgment of the trial Court, the High Court Division unfortunately could not give cogent reason for taking different view on the facts brought on record. The question in dispute is thus a pure question of fact whether the Bainapatra was executed by defendant No. 1. Now the question what should be the right appro­ach for a court of appeal in deciding a question of fact already decided one way by the Court of first instance has drawn atten­tion of higher courts. In the case of <strong><em>Radha Prasad Singh Vs. Gajadhar Singh and others, A.I.R. 1960, SC 115</em></strong> the Indian Supreme Court reviewed the authorities and came to the conclusion as under: <br/>"All the courts in all the cases have stressed the rule which the courts of appeal should observe for themselves: that a judge sitting on appeal not having had the opportunity of seeing and hearing the witnesses should think twice and more than twice before re­versing the findings of fact arrived at by the trial court who had had that opportunity." <br/><br/>13. To say that however is not to say that the court of appeal will never reverse a finding of fact of the Trial Court. <strong>Lindley, Master of the Rolls</strong> in the case of <strong><em>Coghlan Vs. Camberland, (1898), 1 Ch. 704</em></strong> has set out the limitation of the rule in the following manner: <br/>"Even where the appeal turns on a question of fact, the Court of appeal has to bear in mind that its duty is to rehear the case, and the Court must reconsider the materials before the Judge with such other materials as it may have decided to admit. The Court must then make up its own mind, not disregarding the judgment appealed from, but care­fully weighing and considering it; and not shrinking from overruling it if on full consideration the Court comes to the conclusion that the judgment is wrong. When, as often happens, much turns on the relative credibility of witnes­ses who have been examined and cross-examined before the Judge, the Court is sensible of the great, advantage he has had in seeing and hearing them. It is often very difficult to estimate correct­ly the relative credibility of witnesses from written depositions; and when the question arises which witness is to be believed rather than another, and that question turns on manner and demea­nour, the Court of appeal always is, and must be, guided by the impression made on the Judge who saw the witnes­ses. But there may obviously be other circumstances, quite apart from manner and demeanour, which may show whether a statement is credible or not, and these circumstances may warrant the court in differing from the Judge, even on a question of fact turning on the credibility of witnesses whom the Court has not seen". <br/>It is not profitable to multiply instances in support of the principle which is mentioned in the aforesaid paragraphs with which we are in respectful agreement. But this does not mean that the Court of appeal will never reverse the finding of fact of the trial court. In the case of <strong><em>Arju Perhad Vs. Jwaleshawari Pratap Narain Singh, A.I.R. 1951 (SC) 120</em></strong> the Supreme Court of India laid down rule: <br/>"The rule is and it is nothing more than a rule of practice—that when there is conflict of oral evidence of the parties on any matter in issue and the decision hinges upon the credibility of the witnesses, then unless there is some special feature about the evidence of a particular witness which has escaped the trial Judge's notice or there is a sufficient balance of improbability to displace his opinion as to where the credibility lies, the appellate Court should not interfere with the finding of the trial Judge on a question of fact." <br/><br/>14. This rule is a rule of prudence. In the given case the defendant though contested the suit to give challenge to the plaintiff's case by way of giving a superficial reason that the document is antedated and collusive without substantiating the case. When the plaintiff placed on record the registered kabala Ext. 2 the previous one which was executed between the parties, the reason for viewing that the document in question is antedated, does not lend much credence because the previous document is a registered kabala which was executed just before a year. It does not therefore appeal to reason as to why the bainapatra should be characterized as an antedated document. P. Ws. 1, 2, 3 and 4 were examined and cross examined and eva­luating their evidence the trial Judge cauti­ously approached the case and came to the conclusion that the plaintiff has proved his case and accordingly decreed the suit and directed the execution of kabala within 30 days faulting which the plaintiff shall be entitled to get the kabala executed through court. Then in Execution Case No. 30 of 1974 the sale deed was executed and regis­tered by court on 17.7.76 and delivery of possession of the suit property was given by the court on 9.11.76. No prayer was made for staying of the execution case at any stage nor was any prayer for stay made at the appellate stage. These circumstances show that the defendants had contested the suit to quote the trial court "in a half hearted manner". Reasonings that has been given by the High Court Division are not in accordance with the well-established principle for reversing a deci­sion of the trial Court and in this view of the matter this appeal must be allowed.<br/><br/>In the result therefore this appeal is allowed. No costs.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
