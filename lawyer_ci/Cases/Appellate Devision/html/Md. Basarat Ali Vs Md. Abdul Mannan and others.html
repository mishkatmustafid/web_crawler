Abdul Matin J.-</strong> This appeal by leave at the instance of defendant, is directed against the judgment and order dated 20.01.1997 passed by the High Court Division summarily rejecting revisional application filed against the judgment and decree dated 27.10.1996 in Title Appeal No.37 of 1990 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, 1st Court, Sylhet setting aside the judgment and decree dated 17.01.1990 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, 1st Court, Sylhet in Title Suit No.31 of 1986 dismiss­ing the suit.<br/><br/>2. Respondent Nos.1 to 14 instituted Title Suit No.31 of 1986 in the Court of the learned Subordinate Judge, Sylhet for dec­laration of their title to the land described in 2nd schedule which is part of 1st sched­ule land, by inheritance and by amicable partition with defendant Nos. 41 to 135.<br/><br/>3. Case of the plaintiff respondents, <em>inter alia</em>, is that the land of the 1st schedule appertaining to 2514/531. Thakur Das Taluk was recorded in chak No. 33 of Thak No. 3906 of Mouza Sandishail. The said schedule land was owned by Md. Kalim and possessed by Reza Mohammad and Md. Nazeem. By amicable partition Reza Mohammad became absolute owner in possession of land of Chak No.33 and after him, his successor-in-interest i.e. the plaintiffs and proforma defendant Nos.41 to 135 got the same. During the last settle­ment operation the said land was correctly recorded party in the names of the plain­tiffs, partly in the names of defendants and partly in the names of their predecessor-in-interest. On amicable partition 12 annas share of the 1st schedule land, described in the 2nd schedule, was given in the saham of the plaintiff and in the rest of the 1st schedule land pro forma defendant No.41 got saham. Other defendants got land of their share in other chaks. But in the first week of April, 1986 the plaintiffs were astonished to learn that the 2nd schedule land had been recorded in the names of some of the principal defendants and some of their predecessors along with pro forma defendant No.41. The plaintiffs obtained certified copy of the settlement record and came to know about the said wrong record for the first time on 11.05.1985. In fact, none of the principal defendants or their predecessor had or has any title to or possession in the 2nd schedule land. The wrong record as to 12 annas share of 2nd schedule in the names of defendants, as aforesaid, has cast cloud upon the title of the plaintiffs who have been constrained to institute the suit for declaration of their title thereto for removing such cloud.<br/><br/>4. Defendant Nos. 12 and 33 jointly filed a written statement to contest the suit. They denied the allegations of the plaintiffs and specifically pleaded that the plaintiffs are not the successors-in-interest of Reza Mohammad and pleaded bar of limitation, defect of party and maintainability against the plaintiffs suit. Case of the contesting defendant, inter-alia, is that the originally three brothers, namely, Bengal Mahmud, Didar Mahmud and Sheikh Illias had title to the land. In 1834, corresponding to 1244 B.S., settlement operations the said land was recorded in Chitta Dag Nos. 501 and 502 in the names of the said three brothers. Subsequently said land along with other land described in the schedule annexed to the written statement was par­titioned and the said land falls in the saham of Dengai Mahmud alone. After death of Dengai Mahmud his son Reza Mahmud alias Rejak Mahmud became the owner of the land and possessed the same. Thak Survey started at that time wherein the said land was recorded exclusively in the names of Rejak Mahmud in Chak No. 33 of Thak No. 3906 of the said survey oper­ation. While thus enjoying the said land Reja Mahmud sold more or less six kedars of vacant homestead land described in schedule annexed to the written statement to three brothers, Jan Mahmud, Ajir Mahmud and Fazir Mahmud in equal share and delivered possession to them and, ever since, they have been in posses­sion and, ever since, they have been possessing their said purchased land for more than 12 years exercising their right of pos­session in different ways. Said Jan Mahmud sold 1 kedar of land described in schedule to the written statement along with some other lands to his 2nd wife, Hariza Banu, in adjustment of part of demand of her prompt dower on 20th Jaishta, 1279 B.S. and delivered posses­sion to her. Subsequently on the death of said Ajir Mahmud and Fariz Mahmud their interest to four kedars of land devolved upon their brother Jan Mahmud by inheritance. Later, on the death of Hafiza Banu, one Kedar of land obtained by her by virtue of aforesaid kabid kabala was inherited by her husband Jan Mahmud and two sons Rajid Ali and Wahid Ali. After death of Jan Mahmud the said land devolved upon his two sons Hamid and Abdul Hamid by his first wife and Rajid Ali and Wahid Ali by his second wife, Hafiza Banu. After death of Rajid Ali his share was inherited by his brother Wahid Ali and after Wahid Ali's death his interest was inherited by his two daugh­ters, defendant No.39, Hawarunnessa and Mymunnesa. Maymunnesa sold her inter­est to her sister. Hawarunnessa by regis­tered kabala darted 19.11.1950 correspon­ding to 13 Agrahayan, 1357 B.S the remaining four annas share of the 2nd schedule was owned by A. Majid who sold to defendant No. 41 Hatem. After his death his seven sons, Motaher Ali, Wasir Ali, Kasir Ali, Majir Ali, Kahir Ali, Tamsir Ali and defendant No.39 owned the land. Said Motahir Ali and others used to pay rent of their land through father of plaintiff Nos.1-6<br/><br/>5. The said land has been correctly record­ed in the names of defendant Nos. 4-39 within the knowledge of plaintiffs and their predecessor-in-interest. The defendants Nos. 1-38 are heirs of said Motahir Ali and others. 12 annas share of the schedule land is owned and possessed by defendant Nos. 1-40 and the plaintiffs or their predecessor has or had no title to or possession therein and, as such, the con­testing defendants claimed for dismissal of the suit with costs.<br/><br/>6. The trial court dismissed the suit while the lower appellate court in the appeal at the instance of the plaintiffs decreed the suit. Defendant-leave petitioner then moved the High Court Division by an application under Section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure which was sum­marily rejected by a learned Single Judge with a cost of Tk. 3,000/-. Hence this leave petition.<br/><br/>7. It was submitted that in a slip shod man­ner without noticing that alleged genealo­gy in the plaint was incomplete as it was to cover a period over a century and that the impugned judgment of the lower appellate Court was not a proper judgment of rever­sal having regard to the trial court's find­ings upon consideration of the evidence on record both oral and documentary.<br/><br/>8. It was also submitted that awarding a heavy cost while disposing of the revisional application <em>ex parte</em> indicates that the impugned judgment was passed in a biased attitude.<br/><br/>9. Leave was granted to consider the above submissions.<br/><br/>10. Heard Mr. M. A. Azim, learned Advocate and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/><br/>11. The learned Advocate submits that the pleading in paragraph No.3 of the plaint and genealogy having not been stated to cover the period of over one hundred years from the time of Reza Mohammad or Reza Mahmud and contesting defen­dants in paragraph No. 8 of their written statement having categorically denied the plaintiffs  claim  of being successor-in-interest of Reza Mahmud and the plain­tiffs respondents having failed to adduce evidence on the point and the trial court upon consideration of evidence on record, including the kabala (Ext. 5 series) having concluded that plaintiff respondents failed to prove that they are successor-in-interest of Reza Mahmud which had been reversed by the court of appeal below, the High Court Division seriously erred in summar­ily rejecting the revisional  application without scrutinizing the point on merit on the basis of evidence on record.<br/><br/>12. Mr. Mahbubey Alam learned Counsel appearing for the respondents submits that the plaintiffs have been able to prove their case by adducing oral and documentary evidences. In that situation the plaintiffs cannot be satisfied with the only wrongful records of the defendants' names about the suit land. At this the title of the defendants cannot be claimed.<br/><br/>13. He further submits that the lower appellate court has not erred in allowing the appeal and thereby setting aide the judgment of the trial court and the High Court Division has not erred in law in affirming the judgment of the High Court Division and as such the civil appeal may kindly be dismissed.<br/><br/>14.  He lastly submits that summary rejec­tion of the application with cost of Tk.3, 000.00 by the High Court Division does not indicate that it was passed in a based attitude and as such the aforesaid civil appeal is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>15. It appears that Reza Mahmud was the admitted owner of the suit land and the plaintiffs are the admitted successors-in-interest of late Reza Mahmud. The present appellants claimed that Reza Mahmud transferred his interest in favour of Jan Mahmud, Azar Mahmud    and Fajir Mahmud the predecessor of the defen­dants. But they could not produce any evidence in support of such finding. Even the trial court though dismissed the suit held as under:-<br/>“ কিন্তু উত্তরাধিকারী বিবাদিগন তাহাদের কথিতমতে তাহাদের পূর্ববর্তী জান মাহমুদ, আজির মাহমুদ ও ফাজির মাহ মুদের উক্ত খরিদা কবলা দলিল দাখিলি ভূমি তাহাদের দাবীকৃত উক্ত খরিদ প্রমান স্বরুপ কোন প্রকার কাগজাত  আদালতে দাখিল করেন নাই। ইতিমধ্যে এই বিবাদীগন উক্ত জান মাহমুদের ক্রমিক উত্তরাধিকারী সম্পর্কে নির্দিষ্ট বংশ বৃত্তান্ত উত্তরাধিকারী বিবাদি পক্ষ উপস্থাপন করিতে সক্ষম হইয়াছেন। কিন্তু নালিশা সম্পত্তি স্বীকৃত সাবেক রেকর্ডিয় মালিক দখলকার রেজা মাহমুদ কর্তৃক উত্তরাধিকারী বিবাদিগনের পূর্ববর্তী জান মাহমুদ ও তাহার অপর ২ ভ্রাতা বরাবরে সম্পাদিত উত্তরাধিকারী বিবাদিপক্ষের দাবীকৃত কোন কোন কবলা দলিল ব্যাতিরেকে কোন অবস্থাতেই জান মাহমুদ কর্তৃকদের নালিশী সম্পত্তিতে স্বত্ত অর্জন সম্পর্কিত কোন সিদ্ধান্তে উপনীত হওয়া সম্ভবনায় নয়। যেখানে উত্তরাধিকারী বিবাদিগনের পুর্ববর্তী জান মাহমুদ গংদের নাঃ সম্পত্তিতে রেজা মাহমুদ হইতে অর্জনের বিষয়টি সম্পূর্ণ অস্পষ্ট ও অপ্রমানিত সে ক্ষেত্রে উত্তরাধিকারী বিবাদীগনের নাঃ সম্পত্তিতে সত্ব অর্জনের বিষয়টি সম্পর্কে সিদ্ধান্ত গ্রহন মোতেই সম্ভব নয়”।<br/><br/>16. As against these findings of the trial court the present petitioners did not file any appeal before superior court. The appellate court on consideration of the evidence on record particularly cxhibit-5 series and depositions of P.Ws and D.Ws particularly P.Ws.1, 2, 3 and 4 and D.Ws.1, 2 and 3 rightly held that the plain­tiffs proved their case and the defendants failed to prove their title or possession. It is pertinent to mention that exhibit-5 series are registered kabalas. The High Court Division rightly held that P.W.3 deposed that the plaintiffs arc in posses­sion of the dispute 2nd schedule of land. Such evidence has been corroborated by P.W.4.<br/><br/>17. It further appears that the High Court Division has rightly found that the court of appeal below correctly decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiffs.<br/><br/>We find no merit in this appeal which is accordingly dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
