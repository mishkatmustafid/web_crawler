The impugned order is dated 16 January, 1984 in Civil Revision No.121 of 1983 of the High Court Divi­sion at Rangpur.<br/><br/>2. Plaintiff-respondent filed S.C.C. Suit No.4 of 1981 in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Dinajpur, seeking ejectment of the appellant, a monthly tenant in respect of the premises in question, on the ground of default in the payment of rent. The suit was fixed for pre-emptory hearing, after two adjourn­ments, on 27 May 1982, but as the defendant was found absent the suit was decreed <em>ex ­parte.</em> Defendant filed an application on 31 May 1982 under Order IX, rule, 13 of the Civil Procedure Code for setting aside the <em>ex parte</em> decree on the ground that he could not attend the Court on the date fixed for hearing because of his illness. The plaintiff raised objection to the very maintainability of the application taking the ground that the provision of section 17 of the Small Causes Courts Act as to deposit of the decretal dues or furnishing of a bond, along with the filing of the application, was not, complied with. After the expiry of 8 months of this objection the defendant deposited the decretal amount. But the Court rejected the deposit holding that the deposit could have been made at the time of presentation of the application for setting aside the <em>ex-parte</em> decree under section 17(1) the provision of which is mandatory. This view of the learned Small Causes Court Judge has been maintained by the High Court Divi­sion which has also observed that facts of the instant case are quite distinguishable from those of the case of <strong><em>Benode Bepari Saha vs. Nitya Gopal Shaha, 33 DLR (AD), 131</em></strong> in which this Appellate Division observed that in appropriate cases the Court got power to allow time to a petitioner to deposit the decretal amount or to furnish necessary bond beyond the period of limitation.<br/><br/>3. Mr. K. Z. Alam, learned Advocate for the appellant, has argued  that  provision  of section  17(1) of the Small Causes Courts Act is not mandatory and that the deposit made by the appellant in this case should have been  accepted as  due compliance with the provision of this section. Mr. Jamiruddin Sircar, learned Advocate for the res­pondent, on the other hand, contended that the appellant willfully neglected to comply with the provision of section even after the respondent had pointed out to defect on two occasions and that in the circumstances the decision in the case of Benode Bepari Saha is not applicable to the instant case.<br/><br/>4. Section 17(1) of the Small Causes Courts Act provides that in the case of an applica­tion for an order to set aside decree passed <em>ex-parte</em> the applicant shall, at the time of presenting his application, either depo­sit in the court the amount due from him under the decree or in pursuance of the judg­ment, or give such security for the perfor­mance of the decree or compliance of the judg­ment as the Court may, on a previous application made by him in this behalf, have directed. In the case referred to above this Court considered the Question whether the provision of section 17 is mandatory and on review of various decisions of different courts in the subcontinent on this point, observed that the court got power to allow time to an applicant to make the deposit or furnish the bond even after expiry of the period of limita­tion if an application is made for this pur­pose. It was observed:<br/>''If the application for seeking Court's direction is filed along with the applica­tion for setting aside the <em>ex parte</em> decree and court passes necessary orders on the application directing the applicant either to deposit the decretal money or furnish security bond, and the applicant complied with the direction within the time given by the Court, this will be sufficient compliance of the requirement of the proviso. The direction must be complied with within the time given by the Court. All that the proviso to sec­tion 17 (1) requires is that the application for setting aside the <em>ex-parte</em> decree must be filed within the period of limitation on complying with the requirements thereof or obtain a direction from the Court by filing a separate application for compliance of the requirements.<br/>If an application for setting aside <em>ex-parte</em> decree is filed within the time along with an application for necessary direction of the Court and the Court gives the necessary direction in this behalf, which even if complied with beyond the period of limitation, the application for setting aside the <em>ex-parte</em> decree must be treated to have been validly presented as required under the proviso.”<br/><br/>5. It is to be seen whether the facts of the instant case are such as to attract our decision in the above mentioned case. The suit for ejectment was filed in 1981 and date for per-emptory hearing was fixed for 2-1-82, but on the appellant's prayer it was adjourned to 6-4-82 and again to 27-5-82. But on that day also the appellant was found absent by an application. The application was rejected and the <em>ex-parte</em> decree was passed. The application under Order IX, rule 13 C.P.C. was filed within 4 days on 31-5-82. But the necessary deposit was not made, nor any bond, was furnished at the time of filing of the application, nor any applica­tion was made seeking court's permission to make the deposit or furnish security at any subsequent time, and it is the plaintiff-respondent who by an objection dated 7-8-82 raided the question and pointed out that as the deposit was not made or bond was not furnished at the time of presentation of the application, the application was not maintainable. Still the appellant did not take any step to comply with, the requirements of law rather he took two more adjournments for hearing of the application and one of the ap­plications was for examining him on commis­sion at Dhaka. In the circumstances the respondent filed another application on 27-3-84 for dismissing the application for setting aside the decree on the ground of non compliance with the provision of section 17. It is then that the deposit was made on 3-5-83. But to make the deposit no permission or direction of the Court was sought. As such it is clearly found that the facts of this case are quite distinguishable from those of the case of Benode Bepari Saha. The appellant is found to have willfully neglected to comply with the provision of section 17 even when the defect was pointed out by the respondent. In the circumstances, the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division has rightly refused to interfere with the order of the trial court rejecting the application under Order IX, rule 13 C.P.C. The appeal is therefore dismissed. We however make no order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
