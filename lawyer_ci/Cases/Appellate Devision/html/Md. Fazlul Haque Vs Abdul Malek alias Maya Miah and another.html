Abdul Matin J. -</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 27.11.2008 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 1863 of 2007 discharging the Rule and affirming the judgment and order dated 19.03.2007 passed by the learned Senior Assistant Judge, Sadar, Sylhet in Miscellaneous Case No.18 of 2006 rejecting the application for setting aside the order dated 11.03.2007 dismissing the miscella­neous case.<br/><br/>2. The facts, in short, are that the respon­dents herein as plaintiffs instituted S.C.C Suit No.9 of 2005 in the Court of learned Senior Assistant Judge, Sadar, Sylhet impleading the petitioner herein as defen­dant for eviction of the defendant from the suit premises stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit Taluk No. 46687 of 1979 under mouza Chottrish of Upazila Fenchegonj and other land belonged to the predecessor of plain­tiff, Mohammad Asim and his 2 brothers namely Mohammad Asim and Mohammad Kosir though the same was recorded in the name of only Mohammad Asim in the <em>Thak Jorip</em> and while owning and possessing on amicable partition Mohammad Asim died leaving behind his only son Mohammad Farid who thereafter died leaving behind his only son Mohammad Abdul Latif. Mohammad Asim died leaving behind 3 sons namely Jabid Ali, Sunahor Ali and Ajob Ali. 0.70 acres of land was recorded in the name of Abdul Latif and in separate <em>khatian</em> rest 0.12 acres and 0.02 acres of land had been recorded in the name of Jabid Ali and Abdul Latif respectively. Jabid Ali died leaving behind 3 sons namely Mubid Ali, Tojomul Ali and Tofozzul Ali and 2 daugh­ters. Mubid Ali and Tojomul Ali on getting 2nd schedule land amicably in their share transferred the same in favour of Ijjad Ali vide registered kabala dated 16.10.1960 and delivered possessing thereof. Ijjad Ali trans­ferred the said 2nd schedule land on 06.12.1962 in favour of Abdul Latif the predecessor of the plaintiff and delivered possession but as he died before executing the <em>kabala</em> his heirs subsequently executed and registered the said kabala. His heirs subsequently executed and registered the said kabala on 01.12.1985 in favour of plaintiffs and <em>pro forma</em> defendant Nos.39-40. The defendant Nos.1 and 2 predecessor of defendant Nos.10-13, Mokrom Ali, pred­ecessor of defendant Nos.14-19, Mosoddor Ali and one Moiz Uddin and 6 persons mutated the suit land in their name against which plaintiff filed mutation appeal and then it was revealed that with the collusion of Mubid Ali the said 6 persons by creating a <em>"Muktipatra"</em> mutated their names. The suit land was finally recorded in the name of the plaintiffs and proforma defendant Nos.39-47. In the manner as stated the plaintiff and his co-sharer were owning and possessing the suit land. Defendant No.1 by claiming the suit land of his own gave threat to dispossess the plaintiff from the suit land which constrained the plaintiff to file a title suit being No.25 of 2000 and during pen­dency of that suit on 19.06.2000 defendants forcibly dispossessed the plaintiff from the suit land. The plaintiff had withdrawn the suit as there were some formal defects in framing the suit and then instituted the instant suit for declaration of title and recov­ery of <em>khas</em> possession of the second sched­ule land. The defendant No. 1 contested the suit by filing written statement contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that second schedule land belonged to Jabid Ali who while owing and possessing the suit land executed and regis­tered a lease deed on 02.12.1955 in favour of Joroi Ullah, the father of defendant Nos. 1 and 5 others. While Joroi Ullah and others were holding and possessing the suit land the same was recorded in the name of Jabid Ali and thereafter the heirs of Jabid Ali on 02.11.1982 executed and registered a <em>"Muktipatra" </em>in favour of the contesting defendant and thus the contesting defendant and their co-sharer mutated the suit land in their name and paid rent to the government. The plaintiff had preferred a mutation appeal and that was rejected on 15.03.1988. Moin Uddin and others sold out their share to the defendant No.1 by a registered deed dated 04.01.1997 and delivered possession thereof. The suit land was recorded in the name of the defendant No.1. The boundary as described in the plaint is incorrect and unspecified and without holding local inves­tigation the plaintiff can not get any relief. With a view to causing loss to the defendant the plaintiff by withdrawing earlier suit instituted the instant suit with false claim as such he prayed for dismissal of the suit.<br/><br/>3. The petitioner was defendant of the suit. No notice was served upon the defendant and as such upon <em>ex parte</em> hearing the learned Senior Assistant Judge, Sadar Sylhet decreed the suit by judgment and order dated 08.11.2005.<br/><br/>4. On coming to know about the <em>ex parte</em> order the petitioner filed Miscellaneous Case No.18 of 2006 in the Court of the learned Senior Assistant Judge, Sadar, Sylhet alleging non service of summons and prayed for restoration of the original suit upon setting aside the <em>ex parte</em> judgment and order.<br/><br/>5. After hearing the learned Senior Assistant Judge, Sadar, Sylhet by order dated 08.02.2007 allowed the miscellaneous Case by restoring the suit to its original file and number subject to payment of Tk. 1200/- to the plaintiffs of the suit.  But as there occurred delay in depositing cost learned Senior Assistant Judge upon the application of the opposite parties has been pleased to set aside the order dated 08.02.2007 and thereby dismissed the miscellaneous Case for not depositing the amount of cost.<br/><br/>6. Thereafter the petitioner filed an applica­tion under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure for restoration of the order dated 08.02.2007 upon setting said the order dated 11.03.2007.<br/><br/>7. The learned Senior Assistant Judge after hearing the application rejected the same by Order dated 19.03.2007 contending that the application is not maintainable in view of the facts and circumstances of the case.<br/><br/>8. Being aggrieved by the judgment and order dated  19.03.2007 the defendant as petitioner preferred civil revisional applica­tion under Section 25 of the Small Causes Courts Act being Civil Revision No. 1863 of 2007 wherein initially Rule was issued and stay was granted and the Rule was ultimate­ly heard by the High Court Division that discharged the Rule.<br/><br/>9. As against the judgment and order of the High Court Division the petitioner has pre­ferred this petition for leave to appeal.<br/><br/>10. Heard A. J. Mohammad Ali, the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner and   Mahbubey Alam, the learned Counsel appearing for the respondents and perused the petition and the impugned judg­ment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/><br/>11. It appears that for enlargement of time no case was made out before the Court and the deposit as directed by the Court was also not made and therefore the High Court Division committed no illegality in not interfering with the order of the Court reject­ing the prayer for enlargement of time.<br/><br/>We find no substance in this petition which is accordingly dismissed.<br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
