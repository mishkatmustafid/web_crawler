Leave was granted to consider the question whether the defendant-appellant was entitled to protection against eviction under section 18 of the Premises Rent Control Ordinance.<br/><br/>3. Facts are as follows: - Plaintiff-respondent brought S.C.C. Suit No. 23 of 1977 before the Subordinate Judge, 2nd Court, and S.C.C. Judge, Sylhet for eviction of the defendant appellant on the ground of default and irregularity in payment of rent. Plaintiff’s case was that the defendant was a tenant in the suit premises since 1966 at a rental of Tk. 25/- per month. He defaulted in paying rent since July, 1976 and accordingly the plaintiff served a notice on 5.3.77 terminating the tenancy under section 106 of the T.P.Act and to vacate the premises. The defendant received the notice on 12.3.77 but did not vacate. Hence the suit.<br/><br/>4. Defendant contested the suit on many grounds and challenge was given mainly on the principles of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence, the sum and substance of the defendant's case was that as, per the agreement the landlord would send his Karmachari to the suit shop for rent and in fact such rent used to be collected by the Karmachari even after accumulation of rent for many months and such practice was going on from the beginning of the tenancy.<br/><br/>5. The suit land originally belonged to the maternal-grand-father of the plaintiff's son from whom the defendant took lease of the premises. A chart showing the realisation of rents by the plaintiff and her predecessor-in-interest mostly through the Karmachari Jatindra Kumar Das (Exts. A to A (61) was filed by the defendant to prove his contention.<br/><br/>6. The trial Court dismissed the suit by observing:<br/>"The rent receipt Ext. A series support the above contention of the defendant ............<br/>As payment of rent for 2 months to 18 months together was considered by the plaintiff as regular payment of rent, it can not be said that the defendant became defaulter in depositing rent for 9 months together."<br/><br/>7. Being aggrieved the plaintiff preferred a revisional petition and upon hearing the parties in Civil Revision No. 116 of 1982 the learned Single Judge reversed the decision of the trial court and decreed the plaintiffs suit. It was observed that "such conduct could not constitute waiver of the respondent land-lords' right to receive rents by the 15th day of the month next following that for which the rent is payable."<br/><br/>8. The learned Judge observed:-<br/>"In the absence of any contract and also on the failure of the defendant appellants to prove the existence of an oral contract between the parties to the effect that the respondent would collect rents for several months at a time according to his convenience the defendant-appellants must be held to be defaulter within the meaning of the terms used in sub-section 5 of section 18 of the Ordinance."<br/><br/>9. Mr. H. Khondkar learned Counsel appealing for the defendant-appellant canvassed that the plea of waiver, acquiescence and estoppel was specifically taken by the defendant in his pleading. Evidence was given as to the oral contract that the plaintiff would collect rent through his Karmachari even in lump. Such evidence led the trial court to come to the finding that M. Ahmed Chowdhury, the original lessor and grand-father of P.W.1 realised rent through his Karmachari from the defendant for accumulated rents. Even at times the landlord used to collect rent in advance from the defendant vides Exts. A (59) and A (60). After the death of M. Ahmed Chowdhury, his son Sunnat Chowdhury, the maternal uncle of P.W.1 used to collect rent through his karmachari. Ext.A (49) shows that Sunnat Chowdhury through his Karmachari realised 12 months' rent together from Jahid Hossain, a son of defendant. Again the rent receipt Ext.A (45) shows that Sunnat Chowdhury realised-18 months' rent together from the defendant through his Karmachari. The trial court on consideration of evidence concluded:<br/>"It appears from the rent receipt Ext. A to A (44) that from the month of July, 1960 to May 1976 the plff. through her Karmachari realised only 16 months' rent on the month next following from the deft, and his son, and the rent from the remaining period was realised for 2-6 months together."<br/>Evidence was assessed and it was noticed that P.W.1 deposed "before May 1976 he had no grievance against the deft, as defaulter”. It was noticed that this was the manner of collecting rent upto 1976 and thereafter they did not send their Karmachari to the suit shop for realisation of rent and suddenly he got a notice from the plaintiff on 1.2.77 for which he was asked to quit the premises.<br/>The defendant tendered the rent but it was refused; even money order was not accepted by the plaintiff and thereafter he started depositing rent in Rent Deposit Case No. 78-77. Considering these facts and circumstances the trial Court dismissed the suit. The learned Single Judge also noticed this circumstance when it was observed: "that the tenant has become a victim of the circumstances, as he was allowed to pay rent in lump for many months together by the landlord for a long time", and then passed the judgment by observing:<br/>"nonetheless in view of the stringent provisions for payment of rent within 15 days of the month next following that for which the rent is payable, made in Section 18(5) of the Premises Rent Control Ordinance, in order to get the protection from eviction under Section 18(5) the decision made in the above BLD case is binding on the Court." (1984 BLD 298).<br/><br/>10. Reliance was placed on the case of <em><strong>M/s. A. Haque &amp; Co. vs. Zakir Hossain 1984 BLD 298.</strong></em><br/><br/>11. Mr. M.H. Khondkar, learned Counsel contended that the decision in <em><strong>Profulla Kumar Chakroborty's case 1981 BCR (AD) 41</strong></em><strong> was reiterated in 1984 BLD case.</strong> The ratio of two decisions clearly favours the contention of the defendant-appellant that he is entitled to the protection under section 18(5) of the Ordinance.<br/><br/>12<strong>. </strong><em><strong>In Profulla Kumar Chakraborty's case BCR 1981(AD) 41</strong></em><strong>,</strong> the tenant paid rent in lump sum. The question was whether he was a defaulter. It was held:<br/>"A tenant by making payment of rent in lump, shall ordinarily be treated as a defaulter in the payment of rent in terms of sections 18(1) and 18(5) of the Premises Rent Control Ordinance, 1963, unless there is a contract to the contrary of such payment is covered by waiver and acquiescence on the part of the landlord. However, this is a question of fact which is to be established in each particular case by the tenant desiring to raise this as a special plea in his defence."<br/>It was noticed in that decision that "he did not raise any plea of waiver, on the contrary he raised the plea of habitual payment of rent in lump which he failed to establish before the trial Court."<br/><br/>13. That it is a question of fact to be established in each particular case is so well established that it needs no reiteration.<br/><br/>14. This was also noticed in <strong><em>Ramjan Ali Mistry's case 31 DLR (AD) 183</em>.</strong> It was noticed in passing:<br/>"There may be a case of waiver or acquiescence or such supervening facts and circumstances as to make the compliance with the enactment beyond the control of the tenant. However, it will depend on the facts of a particular case to see whether there has been default in the payment of rent in terms of the statute but once the fact is established in terms of the Ordinance, legal consequence flowing there from cannot be averted."<br/><br/>15. Now the case of <em><strong>M/s. A. Haque &amp; Co. VS. Al-Haj Zakir Hossai</strong></em><strong>n</strong>. In that case the question was whether it was a case of waiver when the landlord withdraws the rents from the account of the House Rent Control Case during the pendency of the suit. Be it noted that in that case the landlord while granting receipt for the rent took care in giving such receipt month-wise. It was contended that though there has been lump sum payments and receipts the plaintiff-respondent never accepted such lump sum amounts by granting one receipt. Receipts issued by the landlord show that they were issued month wise that is one receipt for one month and the date of granting each receipt was put within the month before the 15th day of the following month. It was contended such acceptance of rents did not constitute a waiver. It was observed:<br/>"In the absence of any contract and also on the failure of the defendant-appellants to prove the existence of an oral contract between the parties to the effect that the respondent would collect rents for several months at a time according to his convenience the defendant-appellants must be held to be defaulters within the meaning of the terms used in sub-section (5) of section 18 of the Ordinance."<br/>In that decision also the whole emphasis was given on the facts proved in the case.<br/><br/>16. In the case of <em><strong>M/s. Binning &amp; Co. VS. M/s. Nasirabad Properties Ltd. 1986 BLD (AD) 354</strong></em> the question of waiver was considered in its fullness. In that case also it was noticed:<br/>"the plea of waiver has, therefore, to be taken at the earliest opportunity, that is, in the pleading an" evidence must be given at the trial to establish waiver."<br/>On consideration of Ramzan Ali Mistry's case it was held:<br/>"Evidence, as already observed, must be given to establish the plea of waiver. Quite necessarily, the tenant is required to take the plea of waiver at the earliest opportunity, that is, in his pleading and at the trial where it should be raised as an issue."<br/>The majority view has been quoted above and the minority view was that the waiver had been established as a fact in that case. It was focussed that where a party has two rights, the mere exercise of one right does not amount to waiver of the other, but if there are alternative rights, the exercise of one right might imply that the party had waived the exercise of the other.<br/><br/>17. In the present case the defendant had taken in the written-statement and it can be cited in extenso from the judgment of the trial Court:<br/>"His further case, is that he took settlement "of the suit shop from M. Ahmed Chowdhury about 20/22 years ago on monthly rental basis at a rent of Tk.15/- P.M. and at the time of settlement it was agreed upon between the parties that the answering dfdt. Would pay rent of the suit premises as and when the landlord would send his Karmachari to the suit shop to realise rent and accordingly the landlord used to send his karmachari to the suit shop to realise rent and the dfdt. used to pay rent as and when the karmachari used to go. As the amount of rent is very small the landlord used to send his karmachari sometimes after accumulation of the rent of some months according to his convenience and this practice is going on from the very beginning of the tenancy. Sometimes on the request of the landlord the answering dfdt. also paid rent of the suit premises in advance. On the request of the landlord the rent was increased from Tk. 15 to 20 P.M. and the dfdt. paid rent at that rate so long Mr. Ahmed Chowdhury, the father of the plff. was alive. After the death of Mr. Ahmed Chowdhury his son M. Sunnat Chowdhury used to realise rent of the suit premises from the shop through his karmachari as before and during his time rent was increased from TK.201 to Tk.151. Since July, 1966 the rent receipts were issued in the name of the plff. and on enquiry by the answering dfdt. the karmachari informed that by amicable arrangement among the heirs of M.Ahmed Chowdhury the suit premises fell in the Saham of the plff.<br/><br/>18. The plff. is of unsound mind and her husband late Soleman Chy. used to realise rent through Karmachari from the suit shop and after his death his son Hussain Mohammed Chowdhury has been realising rent by sending his Karmachari to the shop as before according to his convenience by accumulating the rent of some months and in this way 'the rent was realised up to May, 1976. But thereafter Hussain Mohammed Chy. did not send his Karmachari for some months. The answering dfdt. was in bonafide belief that the Karmachari of the plff. would come and realise rent from the suit premises according to the convenience as usual. All on a sudden the dfdt. got a quit notice on 1.2.77 and met Hussain Mohammed Chy. at his residence and tendered rent but he with ulterior motive refused to accept rent and as such the dfdt. has been compelled to file rent deposit case No. 78/77 in the court of Rent Controller, Sylhet and have been depositing rent u/s 19(1)(ca) of the Premises Rent Control Ordinance. Hence the dfdt prayed for dismissal of the suit.<br/><br/>19. Thus even on the ratio of <strong>the </strong><em><strong>case of M.A. Haque</strong></em> and the majority view <em>of </em><strong><em>Bunning &amp; Co. Ltd</em>.</strong> there is no escape from arriving at a conclusion that the defendant had made out a case of waiver and acquiescence in the facts and circumstances of the case at the earliest opportunity. Evidence that has been led shows that this was the arrangement between the landlord and the tenant that the Karmachari would come and collect the rent. This practice continued for 16 waiver and acquiescence in the facts and circumstances of the case at the earliest opportunity. Evidence that has been led shows that this was the arrangement between the landlord and the tenant that the Karmachari would come and collect the rent. This practice continued for 16 years. In the meantime the original lessor died and his son for some time managed the property and ultimately it devolved upon the plaintiff. It is the plaintiff's son who is now looking after the property. The trial Court noticed that the management of the property had been well established by the rent receipts Exts. A(1) to A(61) which were issued in lump and it was not granted in month wise receipt as was the case in the earlier decision e.g. M/s. M.A. Hoque.<br/>Then the oral evidence was considered and the trial court found that P.W.1 himself admitted that they had no grievance as to the mode of payment till 1976. The consistent view of this Court is that the waiver is a question of fact and is to be taken at earliest opportunity and must be established on evidence. The present case is an example of waiver and acquiescence. Mr. S.R. Pal, learned Counsel fairly submitted that if rent-receipts series are considered in the light of the oral evidence men the finding of the trial court that a case of waiver and acquiescence has been made out is difficult to assail.<br/><br/>20. Considering the facts of this case the opinion is that the defendant had made out a case of waiver and acquiescence and the judgment of the High Court Division is liable to be set aside and the trial Court was correct in dismissing the suit.<br/>21. In the result, therefore, this appeal is allowed. There will be no order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
