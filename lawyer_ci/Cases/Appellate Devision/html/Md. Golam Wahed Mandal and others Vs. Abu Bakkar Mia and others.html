Abdul Matin J. -</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 05.03.2006 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.344 of 1995 making the Rule absolute.<br/><br/>2.  The facts, in short, are that the predecessor-in-interest of the opposite party No.1(a) Gulam Wahed Mondal and the Opposite Party Nos. 2-3  instituted the Other Suit No.837 of 1984 in the court of learned Assistant Judge, Ulipur under Kurigram for declaration alleging, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit land was originally owned by Mahir, Jaher, Meharun Nessa, Joygun, Jahiran, Masiran under khatian No.817 with an area of 2.13 decimals of land out of said khatian which fell in the share of Masiran, Jahiran and Mohin by dint of a family partition. They settled the area of 2.12 acres of the land to Meharun Nessa by registered Pattan dated 07.12.1933 which land Meharun Nessa at first enjoyed through her father and letter on through her husband.<br/><br/>3. Meharun Nessa by a deed of heba-bil-ewaz dated 12.02.1982 transferred said land to the plaintiffs and delivered posses­sion to them. Since then the plaintiffs had been possessing the land. They entrusted the predecessor-in-interest of the defendant Mozharuddin for getting the same recorded in their name in R.S. record but he managed to get it recorded in his sole name fraudulently with malafide intention.<br/><br/>4. The defendant Nos.6-7 contested the suit by filing written statement denying the plaint case and stating, <em>inter alia,</em> that the suit land was under khatian No.817 Mahiruddin and others were tenant under Hemayetullah. The tenants became defaulter in paying rents, the owner brought the land under his khas khatian under the provision 48(Ga) of the B.T. Act and remained in possession thereof. Hemayetullah subsequently granted pattan of the suit land along with some other land to Muzaharuddin by the registered Pattan dated 15.01.1954. The land was recorded correctly in his name in khatian No.1155. The khatian remained uneffected even on the objection and hearing the parties. Muzharuddin during his possession of the suit land transferred an area of 48 deci­mals of land out of Plot No. 1106 of Kafiluddin, an area of 20 decimals to Azharuddin out of Plot No.1117, an area of 19 decimals to Yazutullah out of Plot No.1051 Yazutullah by a deed of sale dated 13.02.1963 sold an area of 19 deci­mals to Hakim. Hakim also transferred same land to Jamaluddin on 10.02.1970. Kafiluddin sold his 48 decimals of land Nabijan, Nabijan by haba-bil-ewaz trans­ferred same land to Golam Rabbani which land he later on transferred to Aziz who again transferred same land to Golam Rabbani who in his turn transferred the land to defendant Nos.5-6 and they have been possessing the land on payment of taxes in their name. Ashan sold the land measuring 29 decimals to Kader, Golam Rabbani and Golam Hossain sold 18 deci­mals of land to Jamaluddin on 05.09.1980. Golam Rabbanni, Golam Hossain and Gulam Wahed sold an area of 15 decimals to Aziz out of Plot No. 1063 on 10.09.1979. The defendants have been in possession of the suit land. Meharjan did never get pattan of the suit land nor did she transfer the land to the plaintiffs.<br/><br/>5. The trial court decreed the suit and on appeal the appellate court affirmed the judgment of the trial court but the High Court Division set aside the judgment and decree of the courts below.<br/><br/>6. We have heard the learned Advocate-on-record and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/><br/>7. It appears that the High Court Division considered   that   the   settlement   was obtained in the name of minor Meharun Nessa on 07.12.1933 and that there is no evidence that Meharun Nessa exercised her right of possession by asserting her title. The High Court Division also consid­ered that neither Meharun Nessa nor her husband deposed before the court about settlement or possession of Meharun Nessa.<br/><br/>8. The High Court Division further found that the suit on the basis of gift by Meharun Nessa is also time barred. The High Court Division has given reasons for setting aside the judgment and decree of the trial court and the court of appeal and we are not inclined to interfere with such finding of fact.<br/>We find no merit in this petition which is accordingly dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
