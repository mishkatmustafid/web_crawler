Tafazzul Islam J. -</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 21.6.2005 of the High Court Division passed in Writ Petition No.4504 of 2003 discharging the Rule obtained challenging the declaration as contained in S.R.O No. 137 Ain/2003 dated 26.5.2003 Annexure-D to the writ petition issued by the respondent No.1 bringing the rural areas of Palashbari Union Parishad including other five mouzas under urban area.<br/><br/>2. The petitioner filed the above writ peti­tion stating that he is the Chairman of No.3 Palashbari Union Parishad and about 70% of the population of the above Union belonged to agriculturist group as will be evident from the certificates issued by the Upazilla Statistics Officer, Palashbari, Gaibandha and the Upazilla Krishi Officer, Palashbari, Gaibandha, Annexures-G and I to the writ petition, and as such the above declaration dated 26.5.2003 bringing the rural areas of Palashbari Union Parishad under urban area is violative of section 3(2) of the Pourashava Ordinance 1977. The Government opposed the Rule by filing affidavit-in-opposition denying the claim of the writ petitioner. During hearing before the High Court Division the learned Attorney General submitted that in column with the heading "মন্তব্য”of Annexure-H, by mistake 70% of the pop­ulation was shown as অকৃষিজীবী and the correct word will be অকৃষিজীবী and further since the allegations made by the writ petitioner relate to disputed question of facts, the same can not be decided in writ jurisdic­tion as held in the case of <strong><em>Khalilur Rahman (Md) vs. Govt. of Bangladesh &amp; others, 25 MLR (AD) 80.</em></strong><br/><br/>3. The High Court Division, after hearing, discharged the Rule holding that the writ petition is not maintainable.<br/><br/>4. As it appears in <strong><em>25 MLR (AD) 80</em></strong> it has been held that the dispute regarding varia­tion of population cannot be resolved in a writ petition under Article 102 of the Constitution as it requires adjudication on facts on evidence.<br/><br/>5. Accordingly we are of the view that the High Court Division on proper considera­tion of materials on record and the law involved discharged the Rule and accord­ingly the above decision of the High Court Division does not call for any interference.<br/><br/>6. The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
