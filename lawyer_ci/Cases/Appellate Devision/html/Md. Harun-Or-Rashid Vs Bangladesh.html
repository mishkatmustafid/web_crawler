Hassan Ameen J. -</strong> This appeal upon leave is directed against the judgment and order of the High Court Division dated 05-11-1998 in Writ Petition 5629 of 1996 discharging the Rule holding that the peti­tioner failed to prove by adducing any material that the case property, is not an abandoned property.<br/>2. The appellant's case, in brief, is that the case land originally belonged to A. M. Nasiruddin, son of A. M.A. Wadud, who sold out the same to one S.M. Sami Alam son of Late Moulovi S.M. Hossain by registered kabala dated 28-12-1965 and handed over the possession of the said property to him. S.M. Sami Alam con­structed a tin-shed house on the case land, started living there with the members of his family and mutated it in his name in the Office of Bogra Pourashava and Circle Office (Revenue), Bogra Sadar and paid rents and taxes regularly and while in pos­session sold the same to the petitioner by kabala dated 04-04-1973 and delivered possession of the said property to him. The appellant having purchased the prop­erty mutated his name paid rents and taxes to the authority and inducted monthly ten­ant in the property in question and shifted to Dhaka with the members of his family and started living at 23/13 Block-F, Joint Quarter, P. S: Mohammadpur, Dhaka. Thereafter, the appellant was informed in 1976 by his relative Abdul Barek Howlader that one A.F.M. Abdul Jobbar, respondent No. 3 entered into the land in question by evicting his monthly tenant and took possession of the said property illegally. The appellant went to Bogra and made a complain to Bogra P. S. but it was revealed to the police that respondent No.3 took possession of the property in question by obtaining an allotment letter from District Management Board of Abandoned House, Bogra and Police expressed their inability to do anything. Thereafter, the petitioner applied to the Deputy Commissioner, Bogra on various dates to get possession of the property and asserted that the property was not aban­doned property within the meaning of President Order No. 16 of 1972.<br/>3. The appellant instituted Title Suit No.493 of 1983 in the First Court of Munsif, Dhaka against respondent Nos.1-2 and Executive Engineer and Sub-divi­sional Engineer, Abandoned Building Division, Bogra for declaration of his title in the case land and the suit was decreed <em>ex parte</em> on 17-03-1985. Thereafter, the appellant again applied to Deputy Commissioner, Bogra along with the cer­tified copy of the decree of Title Suit No.493 of 1983 for delivery of possession of the property in question but without any result. In the meantime, respondent No.1 published a list of abandoned building in the Bangladesh Gazette, extraordinary on 23-09-1986 but the petitioner's house was not included in the said list. Later on, the respondent No.1 also published so many lists of abandoned buildings in the Bangladesh Gazette but the appellant's house was not included in any of the said Gazette. The Deputy Commissioner, Bogra instead of handing over the posses­sion of the case land instituted Other Suit No.753 of 1987 in the Court of Assistant Judge, First Court, Bogra against the appellant and others for setting aside the <em>ex parte</em> decree passed in Title Suit No.793 of 1983. The learned Assistant Judge returned the plaint of the suit by order dated 12-06-1989. Then an appeal being Other Appeal No. 107 of 1989 was filed by the Deputy Commissioner before the Court of District Judge, Bogra, who upon hearing both sides dismissed the appeal by his judgment and order dated 10-06-1990. Thereafter, the appellant instituted a suit being Title Suit No.296 of 1989 in the Court of Assistant Judge, Bogra against the respondent No.1 and others for recovery of possession of the case land and same was transferred to the Court of Assistant Judge, Second Court, Bogra and renumbered as Title Suit No.119 of 1990, which was dismissed for default. Thereafter, the appellant filed Miscellaneous Case No.50 of 1990 under Order 9, Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure to set aside the dismissal order but the said Miscellaneous case was dis­missed for default. The petitioner then instituted Title Suit No.314 of 1991 in the Court of Assistant Judge, First Court, Bogra on the same cause of action and ultimately prayed for withdrawal of the same and the Court by order dated 13-11-1997 allowed the prayer for withdrawal of the suit. Thereafter, the appellant came to know on 01-12-1996 that the property has been sold by the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Bogra to respondent No.3 by the, registered sale deed and after obtaining certificate copy moved the High Court Division by filing aforesaid writ petition and obtained Rule. The learned Judges of the High Court Division thereafter on hearing both sides discharged the Rule holding that the appellant failed to prove by adducing any material evidence that the case property is not an abandoned property.<br/>4. Md. Alim Hussain, the learned Advocate appearing for the appellant, sub­mits that there were as many as two noti­fications regarding declaration of property as an abandoned   property by the Government but no where the suit land was included thereto as an abandoned property. He further contends that the same clearly led to hold that the suit property had not been declared as enemy prop­erty.<br/>5. We have gone through the impugned judgment passed by the learned Judges of the High Court Division in the matter of discharging the Rule and reasons to believe that the appellant never tried to prove that his vendor was within Bangladesh or that he managed or he supervised the suit property in any way after creation of Bangladesh. On the other hand, it appears from the record that the appellant from time to time filed petitions before the authority for release of the case land from the list of abandoned property admitting neither S. M. Sami Alam nor he was in possession of the property in ques­tion when it was taken over by the Government as enemy property. The rele­vant parts of his application runs as fol­lows:<br/>Text in Bengali<br/>6. It further appears from Annexure-'J' to the Writ Petition that Additional Deputy Commissioner also accepted the applica­tion filed by the appellant for releasing the property from the list of abandoned prop­erty and also directed the Executive Engineer to ascertain as to who is in pos­session on the basis of allotment of the same as an abandoned property. The Annexure-J is dated 07-04-1993 which appears that since P. 0. 16/72 coming into force the appellant did not try to locate at nor he was aware as to whether S.M. Sami was in Bangladesh and he seized to occupy, supervise or manage the property in person, which indicates that the respon­dent Nos. land 2 rightly treated the proper­ty as an abandoned property and leased out the same to the respondent No.3 and ultimately sold the same by registered document. The appellant having failed to discharge his onus that the property in question is not abandoned property inas­much as failed to discharge the onus by adducing any material before the authori­ty and in such view of the facts and cir­cumstances of the case, we find no mate­rial in the submissions of the impugned judgment so passed by the High Court Division in as much as all relevant facts appears to have been considered and we find no latches in the matter of discharging the Rule holding that the appellant hope­lessly failed to prove his case, so there being no substance the appeal is accord­ingly dismissed without any order as to cost.<br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
