The respondents instituted Miscellaneous Case No.9 of 1998 in the 1st Court of the learned Senior Assistant Judge, Gazipur for pre-emption of the case land claiming as co-sharers. The case of the pre-emptors, in short, is that the land in question apper­tained to C.S. <em>Khatian</em> No. 362 of S.A. <em>Khatian</em> No.651, Plot No.1432 measuring an area of 9.34 acres of which .67 acres of land appertained to '<em>Kha</em>' schedule out of which .05 acres of land is the disputed land. The pre-emptors are co-sharers by purchase in the said land. The said land originally owned and possessed by pre-emptee Nos. 3-4 by purchase and a deed of <em>Hiba-bil-Ewaz</em>. Pre-emptee No.4 was possessing and enjoy­ing .17 acres of land on the strength of <em>hiba</em> and he sold .08 acres of land out of .17 acres of land by sale deed No.7989 dated 7th August, 1995, in favour of pre-emptee No.1 on condition that he would transfer the rest portion of that property, delivered the total .17 acres. Thereafter the pre-emptee No.5 being owner of .44 acres of land by deed Nos.6131, 13163 and 4466 dated 9th August, 1982, 20th December, 1992 and 6th May of 1995 respectively sold the total land in favour of pre-emptee Nos.1 and 2. The pre-emptee No.3 purchased the land in question measuring an area of .05 acres of land by registered sale deed No.1094 dated 30th January, 1995, but the property was looked after by the pre-emptors on condi­tion that the pre-emptee No.3 would trans­fer the property subsequently. The pre-emptee No.3 thereupon transferred the same to the pre-emptee Nos.1 and 2 on 31st January, 1998, behind the knowledge of the pre-emptors which they came to know on 13th January, 1998. They proposed to trans­fer the land in question to them which was refused on 20th February, 1998 and the hence the case.<br/><br/>3. The pre-emptee Nos.1 and 2 contested the case by filing a written objection deny­ing all the material averments made in the petition alleging, <em>inter alia,</em> that the case is not maintainable and it is bad for defect par­ties. The vendor sold the land to them by registered kabala dated 31st January, 1998, and delivered possession to them on the same date. The pre-emptors are not co-shar­ers in the disputed holding because of sepa­ration of <em>Jama</em>. The case has been filed on the basis of some false allegations. After purchase they developed the case land by filling earth spending huge amount of money etc.<br/><br/>4. The learned Senior Assistant Judge, Gazipur allowed the pre-emption by the judgment and order dated 22nd February, 2001. Against the aforesaid judgment and order, the purchasers-pre-emptees preferred Miscellaneous Appeal No.6 of 2001 which was heard by the learned Additional District Judge, Gazipur, who by judgment and order dated 22nd August, 2006 dismissed the same. The purchaser-pre-emptees there­upon moved the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.5031 of 2006. A Single Bench of the High Court Division dis­charged the rule.<br/><br/>5. Mr. A. F. M Mesbahuddin, the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners argued that the pre-emptees having mutated their names and separated the holding after pur­chase, the pre-emptors are not entitled to pre-empt the case holding as they arc not the co-sharers by purchase and thus, the learned Judge of the High Court Division erred in law in maintaining the judgments of the Courts below allowing pre-emption. He further submitted that in a pre-emption pro­ceeding there is no scope to examine whether or not the notices of the mutation proceeding were served upon the co-sharers and as such, the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division erred in law in holding that the Pre-emptors are co-sharers in the holding. Learned Counsel lastly submitted that the Courts below as well as the High Court Division failed to appreciate that the pre-emptees-petitioners being co-sharers by purchase from Enamul Hoque by deed dated 11th January, 1998, in respect of .05 acres of the disputed plot, the pre-emptors are not legally entitled to pre-empt the case holding.<br/><br/>6. We have heard the learned Senior Counsel and perused the impugned judg­ment. The Courts below concurrently found that the pre-emptees-petitloners separated the <em>jama</em> without service of notice upon the other co-sharers and thus this mutation would not stand on the way in pre-empting the holding and that the pre-emptors are co-sharers. In view of these findings of fact the High Court Division upon correct assess­ment of the materials on record rightly affirmed the judgments of the Courts below. We, therefore, find no merit in this petition.<br/>The petition is accordingly dismissed.<br/>Ed.<br/> <br/> </div></div></div>
