He obtained an <em>ex parte </em>de­cree in Title Suit No.308 of 1980 and got delivery of possession of the land in suit in execution of the de­cree. But on an application filed by the defendant-respondent under Order IX, rule 13, Civil P.C., the decree was set aside and the suit was restored to file subject to payment of Tk. 500/- as adjournment cost to the plaintiff. He challenged this order by a revisional application, under section 115 of the Civil P.C, before the High Court Division, which was dismissed by a learned Single Judge of the High Court Division by order dated 6 April, 1986.<br/><br/>2. Leave was granted by us to consider the ques­tion whether the trial Court which, having been satisfied that the summons was duly served upon the defendant recorded a finding to this effect and passed the decree, has, thereafter, got power to go against its own finding and set aside the ex-parte decree when the defendant did not appear before the Court to de­pose on oath that the summons was not served upon him.<br/><br/>3. The suit was filed in the 3rd Court of the Subordinate Judge, Dhaka by the appellant for declar­ation of title to 'A' schedule land and recovery of possession in 'B' schedule land, which is a part of schedule 'A', as shown in his plaint. Case of the ap­pellant is that when the process server went to the house of the respondent to serve the summons the latter refused to accept it whereupon the Process-server served the summons by hanging it at the gate of the respondent in presence of witnesses and there-after he submitted his report with a declaration that he had served the notice upon the defendant. The learned Subordinate Judge on perusal of the service return, along with the declaration of the process-server, recorded a finding that he was satisfied that the summons was duly served and on the finding de­creed the suit ex-parte by an order dated 13 June 1984. Appellant put the decree into execution and got delivery of possession of the land through the court on 5th April 1985. Thereupon the respondent filed an application under Order IX, C.P.C. for set­ting aside the decree taking the ground that no sum­mons was served upon him, but it was fraudulently suppressed and that he came to know about the suit and the decree therein for the first time when the de­cree was executed through court. The appellant filed a written objection denying the allegation that the summons was fraudulently suppressed and asserted that it was duly served and, in support of his conten­tion he deposed as a witness in the court. He was cross-examined on behalf of the defendant but the defendant did not depose in the court in support of his contention that no summons was served upon him. The learned Subordinate Judge on these materi­als passed the impugned order on 25 April 1985 al­lowing the application for setting aside the ex-parte decree with an observation that in his opinion "summons was not duly served and that for ends of justice the defendant should be given a chance to contest the suit". This order was challenged in revi­sion - Civil Revision No. 652 of 1985 - but the rule issued thereon was discharged by the learned Single Judge.<br/><br/>4. Khondkar Mahbubuddin Ahmed, learned Counsel for the appellant, has seriously assailed the order setting aside the ex-parte decree. He has con­tended that there was no material whatever before the court to set aside the ex-parte decree by altering its own finding that the summons was duly served. In support of his contention the learned Counsel has re­lied upon a number of decisions. On the other hand, Mr. A J. Mohammad Ali, learned Advocate for the respondent has contended that the trial court which had passed the ex-pane decree got ample jurisdiction to reverse it if it was satisfied on consideration of the application of the defendant that no summons was served upon him in support of this contention the learned Advocate also cited a number of cases. Most of the decisions cited by both the learned Counsels arc found to have been referred to, in the judgment of the High Court Division.<br/><br/>5. It appears that the impugned decision of the learned Single Judge has been mainly based on a de­cision of this Court in the case of <em><strong>Deputy Com­missioner, Sylhet V. Israil Ali and others, 1981 BSCR, 222</strong>.</em> In that case this Court held that a court while passing an ex-parte decree must be satisfied that all requirements of law have been ful­filled and held that the decree passed in that case “neither satisfied the legal requirements, nor from such finding the alleged case of the plaintiff was proved." We are constrained to observe that this deci­sion as relied upon by the learned Single Judge has been misappreciated and misapplied in the instant case by him as this decision got no relevance in the instant case. Facts of that case are very much differ­ent from those of the instant case. Here, in the in­stant case, the question is non-service of summons upon the defendant, but in that case there was no such question as the defendant was admittedly served with the summons and he also entered appearance but did not file written statement on the date fixed for the purpose and nobody was present nor any steps taken when the suit was taken up for hearing. The plaintiff in that case was examined and some rent receipts were also admitted in evidence and on these materials the plaintiff’s claim of tenancy- right under the Government - defendant was declared. The defendant's application under Order IX, rule 13, C.P.C. was rejected by the trial Court as well as the revisional court whereupon the matter was brought before this Court by special leave. It was found that the plaintiff who was lessee of the Government till 1956 claimed tenancy right and filed the suit in 1968 for a declaration to this effect. In these circumstanc­es, this Court held that even in a case of ex-parte decree the court passing the decree must be satisfied that the legal requirement for passing a decree have been fulfilled. Secondly, this Court found that on the date the defendant was found absent the ex-parte decree was not passed by the trial Court as the court - fee paid by the plaintiff was found insufficient; to enable the plaintiff to put in the deficit court fee an ad­journment for one month was given to him by the trial Court; but when the defendant filed an applica­tion to submit written statement his application was refused and the <em>ex-parte</em> decree was passed. This deci­sion therefore does not help the respondent of the in­stant case.<br/><br/>6. The learned Single Judge has gone into the question as to onus of proof in the case of an appli­cation for setting aside an <em>ex parte</em> decree. It appears that the learned Single Judge accepted the, contention of the respondent that it was not for him (defendant) to adduce that the summons was not served upon him but it was for the plaintiff to, show that the summons was duly served. There is no dispute that the onus to prove that the summons was duly served upon the defendant is on the plaintiff. In this case this onus is found to have been fully discharged as the process-server submitted his report, along with a declaration, that he has served the summons by hanging it on the gale of the defendant when the lat­ter refused to accept it and thereafter the plaintiff ap­peared in the court and deposed on oath that the sum­mons was duly served. Thereupon the onus shifted upon the defendant to prove that the summons was not served as claimed by the plaintiff and it was in­cumbent upon the defendant to depose on oath that no summons was served upon him by the process-server as alleged. The process server was, of course, not examined as a witness as his examination is not mandatory in view of the provision of rule 19A of Order V, Civil P. C. Examination of the process-server is mandatory when he has simply submitted his report about the service of summons without any verification or declaration that he had served the sum­mons, but when he made a declaration to this effect then his examination as a witness is not mandatory, although the court may at its discretion call him as a witness. This question as to examination of the pro­cess - server when the summons is served under rules 17 and 19 of Order V, has been decided by this Court in the cases of <em><strong>Santosh Kumar Chakraborty and others v. Motaleb Hossain and others, 36 DLR (AD) 248=1985 BLD (AD) 59 </strong></em>and<em><strong> Khurshed Anwar v. Jamil Akhter, 1982 BLD (AD) 83.</strong></em><br/><br/>7. Mr. A. J. Mohammad Ali has tried to show us that when the trial court arrived at a finding that the summons was not; served duly, the High Court Division rightly refused to interfere therewith in re­vision. But the question is what is the basis of trial court's finding that the summons was not served. The basis, as appears from record, is the mere claim of the defendant made in his application under Order IX, rule 13 C.P.C. that no summons was served upon him. This claim was not backed by him by ad­ducing evidence in court as against the process -server's report and the evidence of the plaintiff; As such this claim is not sufficient for the trial court to alter its previous finding that the summons was duly served. In the circumstances the trial Court is found to have illegally set aside the <em>ex parte</em> decree the learned Single Judge did not direct his attention to this aspect of the matter.<br/><br/>8. In the result, the appeal is allowed; the impugned orders of the High Court Division and the trial Court are set aside and the application under Or­der IX, rule 13, C.P.C. is dismissed. No order as to costs.<br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
