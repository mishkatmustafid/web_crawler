The respondent No. 1 without perusal of the entire records, decision of the Union Parishad preferred feasibility report of the respondent accepting the report of Thana Nirbahi Officer who selected the Brahmpur Mouza defying the selected Sukhdeb Nagar site and feasible site of Brahampur Mouza near Baharampur Bazar for the construction of the proposed new Union Parishad Building without ascertaining any com­ment thereof.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> Mr. Md. Aftab Hossain, learned Advocate-on-Record, appearing for the petitioner submitted that the impugned order is bad in law not in conformity with the approved circular of respondent No.1; that the respondent No. 1 as the maker of the circular under the delegated authority of the Government violated itself by non-observing the directory instructions which were binding upon all the parties. Five major vital points are mandatory to select a site as stated in clause 2 of the circular. The impugned site is situated at the centre point of the Union territory except all other four requirements. The respondent No. 1 neither perused the circular nor fol­lowed the construction of the circular thereon. It made the administrative order as a matter of course instead of rule of pro­cedure arbitrarily and as such, violated the binding rights of the petitioner and no right to depart from the circular at its own motion or sweet will. The respondent No. 1 clearly violated the standard or norms of the circular; That the circular is modus operandi by which an objective decision in respect of a subject matter could be solved unjust and arbitrary process adopt­ed the recommendation of respondent No. 4 which was stained with objective stan­dard for determining the proper decision and barred by the principle of estoppel; the respondent No. 1 violated the rule of Business in taking decision without refer­ring the matter of the cabinet division or <em>suo motu</em> in its own motion inquire the matter under Section 63 of the Union Parishad Manual; that the respondent No. 1 approved Sukhdeb Nagar and Khalish Mouza under the representation of respon­dent No. 4 which is a ditch and low lying land and not at all eligible for selection in any way under the instruction of the circu­lar and eluded itself in approving the order which is unlawful from the administrative point of view that the respondent No.1 arbitrarily, irrationally and unfairly eluded itself the frame work of the circular which is the legal rights of the <em>pro bono</em> public under the representation of the petitioner and non-compliance of the instructions of the circular has caused no legal entity of the impugned order that the Dohakul Union Parishad is one of the administra­tive unit under the constitution and under Section 3A of the Union Parishad Manual and the local elected representative of the people are local bodies under the Government. The formal lawful decision by majority votes of the members of the Union Parishad has been withheld by an administrative order of respondent No.1 out of malafide and irrational representa­tion of respondent No. 4 in violating the Notification passed by the respondent No. 1, should be declared to have been passed by no lawful authority and the entry of the Union Parishad as local bodies would be violated as per provisions of the constitu­tion that the Dohakul Union Parishad selected the Baharampur Brahmpur Mouza site for the construction of new Union Parishad Building which is near the old Union Parishad Building by a resolu­tion which is passed by majority votes and the said formal decision has been approved by subsequent general meeting. An inhabitant of local Parishad gifted 0.50 acre instantly. The entire information has been communicated to the respondent No. 4 made an adverse remarks against the Dohakul Union Parishad behind the back of it and without formal inquiry about the matter under section 63 of the Union Parishad Manual and mislead the respon­dent No. 1; that the Government had over all control over activities of the Dohakul Union Parishad. If it has been selected the site of new Union Parishad Building in non-conformity with law or is in any way against the public interest, the Government may suspend the execution of resolution passed or order passed by the Union Parishad under Section 61 of the Union Parishad Manual Ordinance, 1983. But the Government neither suspended the execution of the resolution passed by the majority voter (Anncxure-G1, H1). The respondent No. 1 Violating the provision of lawful authority even over looking the objection made by the local people (Annexure-J), unfairly, unreasonably and arbitrarily approved the site for the con­struction of new Union Parishad Building at Sukhdeb Nagar recommended by respondent No. 1 (Annexure-K).<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> The learned Advocate further submitted that one of the interested inhabitants of the locality undertook to gift 0.50 acre proper­ty of the proposed new Union Parishad Building construction. The said site is the most suitable and feasible place. All the local people of the locality will be benefited. Their over all activities round by Bagarpara bazar. There is a bus running highway road from Jessore to Narail. There is a Government Primary School, a two storied High School, a Madrasa, a hospital, a Post Office, a registered former Club, Kazi Office, Mosque, Kali Mandir and renowned old and large hut and bazar as well as other private offices (Annexure-A1, C, and E). On the other hand, in Sukhdeb site, there is a primary school near the selected site and had no other public com­munication in respect of any matter (Annexure-K) in comparison with the two selected sites, the Brahmapur Mouza near Baharampur Bazar site got the preference and privilege over the impugned site.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> It appears from the record that the High Court Division held that since the site selection for construction of Union Parishad Bhaban is a matter of Government policy in accordance with law and the Authority has done the same. Accordingly, the High Court Division finding no substance in this application rejected the same summarily.<br/>In view of the, above we find no sub­stance in the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></span><br/> </div></div></div>
