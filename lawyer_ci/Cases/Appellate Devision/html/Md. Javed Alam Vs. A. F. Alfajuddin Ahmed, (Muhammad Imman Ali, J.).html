The plaintiff stated, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">inter alia,</em> that the suit land belonged to S.M. Rahmatullah and during Liberation War of 1971, he deserted the property and as such, the same was declared abandoned property under President’s Order 16 of 1972. The suit property was included in the ‘Ka’ list of the abandoned properties prepared on 23.09.1986. The present appellant filed an application under Ordinance No.54 of 1985 before the Court of Settlement for exclusion of the property from the abandoned properties list and the said application was registered as Case No.1019 of 1992 before the Court of Settlement and the case was heard by the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Court of Settlement, but the respondent-Government did not disclose the fact that the father of the applicant by practicing fraud made a claim that he got the property by way of auction purchase. Thereafter, the appellant on 10.12.1998 obtained an order from the Court of Settlement for excluding the <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">property </span>from the abandoned list. The appellant thereafter moved the High Court Division by filing writ petition for a direction upon the respondent-Government to restore the vacant possession of the suit property in his favour and obtained Rule <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Nisi</em> in Writ Petition No.5021 of 1999. The High Court Division by judgement and order dated 04.03.2001 made the Rule <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Nisi </em>absolute and directed the respondent-Government to hand over the vacant possession of the suit property to the appellant. Pursuant to the said judgement and order, the Government on 24.12.2001 directed the plaintiff respondent to hand over possession of the suit property within 7 days from the date of receipt of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">the said notice. </span>Subsequently, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">the </span>plaintiff-respondent herein was evicted <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">from </span>the suit property. </span></span></p><p class="Style2" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span class="FontStyle11"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong></span><!--[endif]--><span class="FontStyle11"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New';">The plaintiff-respondent stated that the Government took decision to <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">dispose of </span>abandoned properties and accordingly, the plaintiff applied for purchasing the suit property, and the appellant did not take any step to resist the sale of the suit property and the Government transferred the suit property to the plaintiff by a registered deed of sale dated 08.11.1990 for a consideration of Tk.1,01,091.00. Thereafter, the plaintiff took loan from respondent No.5, National Bank Limited and constructed a semi pucca structure on the suit land by spending about taka 20 Lac. The respondent-plaintiff on going through abandoned property list and records of the Court of Settlement discovered that by judgement and order dated 10.12.1998 it released the suit property from the abandoned properties list. In Writ Petition No.5021 of 1999, the High Court Division passed a direction upon the respondent-Government to hand over vacant possession of the suit property in favour of the appellant. The <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">Deputy Commissioner, </span>Mymensingh thereafter, on 24.12.2001 issued a notice upon the <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">plaintiff directing him to hand over vacant possession </span>and on receipt of the notice of eviction the plaintiff preferred Civil Petition for Leave to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Appeal </span>No.<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">226 </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">2002 </span>before this Division against the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">judgement and </span>order dated 04.03.2001 passed in Writ Petition No.5021 of 1999. The Government also preferred Civil Petition for leave to Appeal No.2186 of 2001 before this Division against the said judgement and order dated 04.03.2001. In addition the plaintiff-respondent filed Writ Petition No.3817 of 2002 challenging the decision of the Court of Settlement in Case No.1019 of 1992 which had declared the suit property as not abandoned. The Rule issued in the said writ petition was discharged on contest on 14.06.2003, against which the plaintiff filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.963 of 2003 before this Division. By its judgement and order dated 27.08.2003 this Division dismissed both the petitions. The Government, was made party in the case before the Court of Settlement as well as in the writ petition filed by the petitioner and the Government had taken all necessary steps in support of the plaintiff’s case, but the Court found that the property was not abandoned property and accordingly, released the same in favour of the appellant.</span></span></p><p class="Style2" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span class="FontStyle11"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong></span><!--[endif]--><span class="FontStyle11"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New';">The appellant herein, as defendant in the suit claimed that after disposal of the plaintiff’s leave petitions by this Division, the plaintiff-respondent lost all sorts of claim over the suit property and the present suit was barred by the aforesaid judgement and, as such, the plaint was liable to be rejected.</span></span></p><p class="Style2" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span class="FontStyle11"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">5.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong></span><!--[endif]--><span class="FontStyle11"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New';">The plaintiff-respondent filed written objection against the application for rejection of the plaint, stating that, the suit property was released illegally by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">Court </span>of Settlement in favour of appellant <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">as </span>he obtained the said order on the basis of some false and forged documents and that the Appellate Division did not dispose of the leave petitions on merit.

We find from the records that the Court of Settlement, being competent to decide the matter of the abandoned character of the property, after due consideration of all evidence and facts presented in the case decided that the property in question was not abandoned. The Government was the competent party to challenge that decision. Any occupier of the property as tenant under the Government, within the scheme authorising the Government to manage the said property, has no <em>locus standi</em> to challenge the decision of the Court of Settlement. If the Government succeeds in establishing that the property was lawfully included in the list of abandoned properties, then only the question of transferring the property to the occupier will become relevant. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 0in 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span class="FontStyle11"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Book Antiqua';">21.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></strong></span><!--[endif]--><span class="FontStyle11"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New';">The effect of the decision of the Court of Settlement that the property was not abandoned is that the inclusion of the property in the abandoned property list by gazette notification dated 23.9.1986 is negated and that decision that the property was not abandoned relates back to the date on which it was included in the gazette. In other words, the effect of the finding that it is not abandoned means that it was not abandoned on 23.9.1986. Hence, transfer of the property by way of sale dated 18.10.1990 to respondent No.1 is nullified since the property was not abandoned and, therefore, the Government had no authority to transfer the property. It is curious that the Government did not mention the sale of the property at any point in time during the proceedings before the Court of Settlement or indeed when the matter was pending before the High Court Division. When the Government came before this Division, only the direction of the High Court Division with regard to interest to be paid on the rental amount was challenged. In our view the decision of the Government to release the property from the “Ka” list of abandoned properties by Gazette dated 02.12.2004 has put a final seal on the matter. The abandoned character of the property having been established all the way to this Division and the challenges of the Government as well as the present respondent having been unsuccessful, there can be no doubt about the legality of the gazette notification dated 02.12.2004 and hence we find that the trial Court rightly rejected the plaint of writ-respondent No.1 under Order VII, Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 0in 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 8.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span class="FontStyle11"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Book Antiqua';">22.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></strong></span><!--[endif]--><span class="FontStyle11"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New';">In view of the above discussion, we find that the judgement and order of the High Court Division is not in accordance with law and accordingly the impugned judgement and order is set aside and the judgement and decree dated 24.03.2006 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, First Court, Mymensingh in Other Class Suit No.03 of 2004 is upheld. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 0in 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 8.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">23.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span class="FontStyle11"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New';">In the result the appeal is allowed, without however, any order as to costs.</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 31.5pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: Times-Roman;">           Ed. </span></strong></p><div style="mso-element: footnote-list;"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><br clear="all"/><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/><!--[endif]--><div id="ftn1" style="mso-element: footnote;"><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="file:///H:/article/Issue__March__19(1)/Issue__March_19__C.%20A.%20118%20of%2014__Muhammad%20Imman%20Ali,%20J___AD___5.doc#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1;" title=""><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">CIVIL<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>APPEAL<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>No. 118 OF<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>2014</span></u></strong></a><u> </u></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; color: black; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">(From the judgement and order dated 15th of March, 2010 passed by the High Court Division in First Appeal No.161 of 2006)</span></p></div></div></div></div>
