Muzammel Hossain J. -</strong> Delays of 129 days and 79 days in filing the Civil Petition Nos.83 of 2009 and 129 of 2009 respectively are hereby condoned.<br/>2. These petitions for leave to appeal aris­ing out of the same judgment and order are taken together for hearing analogously. These leave petitions are directed against the judgment and order dated 04.11.2008 passed a Division Bench of the High Court Division in First Miscellaneous Appeal No.37 of 2007 dismissing the appeal and thereby affirming the order No.25 dated 06.02.2007 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 3rd Court, Chittagong in Other Class Suit No. 346 of 2005 granting mandatory injunction directing the added defendant Nos.3 and 4 petitioners to deliver possession of Suit Shop No. 19 of Younusco City Center in favour of the proforma respondent Nos.2 and 3.<br/>3. The facts of the case, in short, are that the respondent No.1 as the plaintiff on 30.07.2005 instituted Other Class Suit No. 191 of 2005 against the defendant No.1 and 2 for a declaration that he is the legal allottee of the Shop No. 19 of the Younusco City Center and the defendants have no right to cancel the same and for some other reliefs. The Suit was filed in the First Court of Joint District Judge, Chittagong, which, on transfer, to the Court of Joint District Judge, Third Court, and Chittagong was renumbered as Other Class Suit No.346 of 2005.<br/>4. The plaintiffs case in short are that Shop No. 19 was allotted to him against his application for allotment dated 14.02.2004 fixing the consideration amount at Tk. 22,63,000/- for setting up a jewellery (gold) show room and accordingly an agreement was also made on 14.01.2004 and in terms of agreement down payment was made on 14.01.2004 and subsequent­ly the monthly installments were being paid and the formal allotment letter for the suit shop No. 19 was issued on 29.06.2004 and as per terms of the said agreement if the installment is not paid on dates, then delay charge @ 2% was required to be paid and if installments for 3(three) con­secutive months are not paid, then he would became a defaulter as per condition No.3 of the agreement and that the plain­tiff has paid and the defendant received the installments up to March 2005 against which receipts were granted but thereafter, inspite of efforts, the installments for the months of April, 2005 and May, 2005 could not be paid since refused by the defendants and faced with such situation the plaintiff sent the installments for the said two months together with delay charge through a pay order to the defen­dants by registered post on 07.06.2006 and which was received on 14.06.2005 and that the defendant Nos.1 and 2 issued the cancellation letter dated 16.06.2005 alleging amongst other, that the plaintiff failed to make the payment of installments on dates and that the defendants returned Tk. 10,00,000/- being the amount of the installments paid through a pay order along with the cancellation letter and that the pay order for the installments for the months of April,2005 and May,2005 sent through registered post was also returned and that the said cancellation of allotment of the shop being illegal and hence the suit.<br/>5. After filing of the suit on 30.07.2005 the plaintiff filed an application under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure praying for an order restraining the defendant Nos.1 and 2 from allotting the suit Shop No.19 to any other person and not to deliver possession of the said suit shop to any other person except the plaintiff.<br/>6. The trial Court on hearing the applica­tion issued an order asking the defendants to show cause within 5 days as to why the prayer for injunction should not be grant­ed. The defendant No.1 appeared on 03.08.2005 and prayed for time to file written objection and thereafter the defen­dant Nos.1 and 2 filed a written objection on 24.08.2005 against the said application for injunction. In the written objection the defendant Nos.1 and 2 stated that the allot­ment of the shop No. 19 in the name of the plaintiff has been cancelled in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agree­ments inasmuch as the plaintiff became a defaulter and that the said suit shop has been allotted in favour of one Md. Khorshed Alam against his application for allotment fixing the consideration amount at Tk.22,54,600/- and thereby the defen­dants suffered a loss of Tk.58,400/- and the prayer for injunction is liable to be rejected as the plaintiff has no prima-facie case and the balance of convenience, is also not in favour of the plaintiff.<br/>7. On 11.10.2005 the plaintiff filed an application for impleading the present petitioners as defendant Nos.3 and 4 and on the same date plaintiffs also filed an application under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure praying for restraining the defendant Nos.1 and 2 from delivering the possession of the suit shop in favour of the defendant Nos.3 and 4 and to restrain the respondent Nos.3 and 4 from forcefully entering into the suit shop and conducting any business therein. On 24.10.2005 defendant Nos.1 and 2 and the defendant Nos.3 and 4 filed written objection sepa­rately against the application for injunc­tion dated 11.10.2005 wherein the defen­dants stated about the cancellation of the allotment of the said shop and new allot­ment given in favour of the defendant Nos.3 and 4 and subsequently on 30.10.2006 the defendant Nos.1 and 2 filed an additional written objection stat­ing for the first time that the possession of the said shop was handed over to the defendant Nos.3 through his attorney defendant No.4 on 22.09.2006. Thereafter the plaintiff filed an application for mandatory injunction on 27.11.2006 for restoration of possession of the suit shop to the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 by the defen­dant Nos.3 and 4 alleging that the story of the delivery of possession on 22.09.2006 is concocted and fraudulent  and  the alleged delivery of possession of the suit shop by the defendant Nos.1 and 2 in favour of the defendant Nos.3 and 4 was made during pendency of the suit and too after  filing  of the  written  objections against the prayer for temporary injunc­tion and prayed that the suit shop should be restored by the defendant Nos.3 and 4 as it was delivered without permission from the Court during pendency of the suit and that the  action  of the defendants amounts to fraud upon the Court to frus­trate the case of the plaintiff. The learned Joint District Judge by order dated 06.02.2007 held that the alleged delivery of possession on 22.09.2006 is antedated inasmuch as by the order dated 22.10.2006 the defendants were restrained from handing over possession of the suit shop and as such the delivery of posses­sion is illegal.<br/>8. The defendant Nos. 3 and 4 petitioners being aggrieved by the aforesaid order dated 06.02.2007 passed by the learned Joint District Judge granting mandatory injunction preferred an appeal being First Miscellaneous Appeal No. 37 of 2007 before High Court Division. A Single Bench of the High Court Division by the impugned judgment and order dated 04.11.2008 upon hearing the parties dis­missed the appeals affirming those passed by the learned Joint District Judge and directed the defendants to handover and restore the possession as ordered or with­in 10(ten) days. Hence the Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.83 was filed by the defendant Nos. 3 and 4-petitioners and Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 129 of 2009 was filed by the defendant Nos.1 and 2-petitioners.<br/>9. Syed Amirul Islam, the learned Senior Advocate appearing for the peti­tioners In Civil Petition No 83 of 2009 and Mahbubey Alam, the learned Senior Advocate appearing for the petitioners in Civil Petition No. 129 of 2009 made identical sub­missions to the effect that the plaintiffs having entered into an agreement to pur­chase a shop which was under construc­tion and in view of his failure to pay the installments the landlord having cancelled his allotment and the plaintiff having not filed proper suit the High Court Division erred in affirming the order of mandatory injunction in favour of the plaintiffs and that the suit shop was under construction and the plaintiff having not been given delivery of possession of the suit shop and there being no case of dispossessing him from the suit shop the High Court Division erred in law in passing mandato­ry order of injunction in favour of the plaintiffs and as such the impugned judg­ment and order is liable to be set aside.<br/>10. In the instant case admittedly the suit shop was allotted by the defendant Nos.1 and 2-petitioners In Civil Petition No.129 of 2009 in favour of the defendant Nos.3 and 4-petitioners In Civil Petition No of 2009. The High Court Division having considered the materials on record rightly found that the defendant Nos.1 and 2 received the down payment and installment from the plaintiffs till March, 2005, granted receipts and accordingly the High Court Division rightly found that the cancellation of the allotment of the shop on the ground of default in making payment of installments and without issuance of any show cause appears to be not proper. The High Court Division on consideration of the materials on record rightly found that on 22.10.2006 an ad-interim order of injunction was passed by the trial Court restraining the defendants from handing over the posses­sion of the suit shop and thereafter on the plaintiffs application dated 27.11.2006 with a prayer for mandatory injunction the impugned order of mandatory injunction was passed on 06.02.2007. The High Court Division also found that during the pendency of the application for injunction, the defendant Nos.1 and 2 without taking any permission from the Court delivered possession of the shop in favour of the defendant Nos.3 and 4 though they had contested the injunction prayers. The High Court Division also found that the act of the defendant Nos.1 and 2 is not <em>bonafide</em> in giving delivery of possession of the suit shop without permission of the Court. The discloser of the alleged delivery of the possession was made by the defendants subsequent to the passing of an order of injunction restraining the defendants from giving delivery of the possession of the suit shop. Having considered all the mate­rials on record the High Court Division rightly observed: "The facts remains that on 22.10.2006 an ad-interim order of injunction was passed but the fact of the delivery of possession of the suit shop was not brought to the notice of the Court below till 30.10.2006." Accordingly the appeals were rightly dismissed by the High Court Division by upholding the order of temporary injunction and direct­ing to restore the possession.<br/>11. On perusal of the materials on record and the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division and having considered the submissions advanced on behalf of the parties we find that the High Court Division dismissed the appeals on proper consideration of materi­als on record. Accordingly it does not suf­fer from any legal infirmity which does not call for any interference by this Court. In consideration thereof we do not find any substance in the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioners in both of the leave petitions.<br/>Accordingly, both of the leave peti­tions are dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
