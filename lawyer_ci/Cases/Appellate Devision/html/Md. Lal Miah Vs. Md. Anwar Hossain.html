Section 3 of the Limitation Act provides for dismissal of a suit if filed beyond the period of limitation. Admittedly the suit having filed beyond the prescribed period of limitation there is no other alternative but to dismiss the suit as barred by limitation. The High Court Division on consideration of materials on record held that the learned Subordinate Judge committed an error in the decision occasioning a failure of justice in passing the impugned judgment and decree.                                                                                                                         … (8)</strong></div> <br/><strong><em>Lawyers Involved:</em></strong><br/><em>Mohammad Nawab Ali, Advocate-on-Record-For the petitioner.             </em><br/><em>Not represented- the Respondent.</em><br/><br/><strong>Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.211 of 2006</strong><br/>(From the judgment and order dated 25th July, 2005 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.2651 of 1999).<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Judgment</strong></span></div><strong>                </strong><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mohammad Fazlul Karim J.</strong> - This peti­tion for leave to appeal directed against the judgment and order dated 25.07.2005 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 2651 of 1999 making the Rule absolute challenging judgment and decree dated 28.04.1999 passed by the learned 5th Subordinate Judge, Artha Rin Adalat, Mymensingh in O.C. Appeal No.311 of 1997 allowing the appeal reversing those dated 04.09.1997 passed by the learned Senior Assistant Judge, Nandail, Ishwarganj, Mymensingh in Other Class Suit No. 27 of 1995 dismissing the Suit.<br/><br/>2. The petitioner as plaintiff instituted Other Class Suit No. 27 of 1995 in the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Nandail, Moymensingh for declaration against the defendant-respondent alleging, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit land belonged to Asar Ali and after death of Asar Ali his wife, son and daughter became sharer of the suit proper­ty and his wife would look after the prop­erty on her behalf and on behalf of her minor son and daughter. The plaintiff-peti­tioner's mother did not sell the suit proper­ty but defendant-respondent created a forged document which his mother did not sell and the plaintiff-petitioner was in pos­session of the suit land.<br/><br/>3. The defendant-respondent contested the suit contending, inter alia, that the suit is not maintainable in its present from and the plaintiff-petitioner's mother for neces­sity to maintain his family sold the suit property to the defendant-respondent by registered kabala and delivered possession of the same in the year, 1976.<br/><br/>4. The plaintiff-petitioner examined 3 wit­nesses including himself and filed docu­ments which are marked as exhibits and on the other hand defendant-respondent examined two witnesses including himself and filed documents which were marked exhibits.<br/><br/>5. Mr. Mohammad Nawab Ali, learned Advocate-on-Record, appearing for the petitioner submitted that the impugned judgment and order of the High court Division is neither proper nor in accordance with law; that the High Court Division committed an error of law result­ing in error in the decision of the case occasioning a failure of justice in misread­ing the pleadings of the parties as well as the evidence on record and in filling to consider the legal effect of the admitted fact and in basing his decision on mere surmise and conjecture and not on the legal evidence on record; that the High Court Division manifestly erred in law in failing to appreciate that the suit land is homestead land and the petitioner has been owning and possessing the suit land by making house thereon but the defen­dant-respondent never possess the suit land; that the defendant-respondent never got the possession of the suit land on the basis of the alleged deed of sale and as such, the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>6. It is apparent that the suit was filed on 06.05.1995 wherein the plaintiff made a prayer under Order 39 rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure for restraining the defendants. The plaintiff sworn in an affi­davit in support of the prayer for injunc­tion and disclosed that he was aged about 28 years on that date. The plaintiff was examined by the trial Court on 15.07.1996. The plaintiff in his cross examination has admitted প্রায় দশ বৎসর হয় বিবাহ করি। He future admitted that আমার বয়স সর্বোচ্চ ২৮ বৎসর Article 44 of the Limitation Act provides a limitation for filing any suit by a ward within 3 years on attaining majority or within 12 years from the date of execution or rejection of the deed. The plaintiff had to file his suit within 3 years from date of attaining majority in the 12 years from the date of execution or rejection of the deed in 1946. But in the instant case he has filed that suit long after 3 years of his attaining majority or beyond the period of 12 years of the execution or reg­istration of the deed. As per his admission he was aged about 28 years on 09.05.1995. So, in any view of the matter the suit is barred by limitation. But the appellate Court failed to consider the question of limitation as per law and hence the impugned judgment and decree are not sustainable in law and are liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>7. It appears that the plaintiff claimed this possession which is supported by the P.W.2 and P.W.3 on the contrary the defen­dant claimed possession in the suit land having placed   Ext-'Kha'; the recent Khatian has been prepared in the name of the defendant. This Ext-'Kha' has got its presumptive value of correctness unless the contrary is proved. The plaintiff did not adduced any single piece of evidence against the preparation of the recent record.<br/><br/>8. The High Court Division observed that the presumptive value of the exhibit-'Kha' has remained unshaken and goes against the plaintiffs; that the learned Assistant Judge has discussed and discussed and considered the evidence on record proper­ly and has come to a correct decision in deciding  the  question  in  controversy. Admittedly the plaintiff having failed to institute the suit within 3 years after attaining 21 of his age the suit is held to be barred by limitation.  Section 3 of the Limitation Act provides for dismissal of a suit if filed beyond the period of limita­tion. Admittedly the suit having field beyond the prescribed period of limitation there is no other alternative but to dismiss the suit as barred by limitation. The High Court Division on consideration of materi­als on record held that the learned Subordinate Judge committed an error in the decision occasioning a failure of justice in passing the impugned judgment and decree.<br/>In view of the above, the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner deserve no consideration.<br/>Accordingly, the petition dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
