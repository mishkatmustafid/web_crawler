He has been ordered to be ejected on the ground of the landlords' <em>bonafide </em>requirement of the premises for the purpose of re-building and re- construction of the building according to an approved plan of the Dhaka Improve­ment Trust. He is now challenging the High Court Division's order, in Civil Revision No. 1161 of 1982, refusing to interfere with the concurrent decision of the trial Court and the lower Appellate Court which decreed the suit for ejectment; the ground taken by the appellant is that the question of <em>bona­fide</em> requirement in this case has not been determined on correct construction of sec­tion 18 of the Premises Rent Control Ordi­nance and in accordance with the authorita­tive judicial decisions as laid down in the case of <strong><em>Jagadish Chandra Surker vs. Abdul Aziz, 7 DLR 314</em></strong> and <strong><em>Abdullah Bal vs. Adam Ali, 13 DLR SC 13</em></strong>.<br/><br/>2. The premises in question is No. 4. Asad Avenue, Mohammadpur, Dhaka. It consists of several rooms. The appellant has been occupying one such room as a monthly tenant and running a business there from the time of the previous owner, one Mrs. Amirunnessa. The respondent got title and possession of the entire premises by purchase from Mrs. Amirunnessa—a fact about which there is no dispute. The appellant has been paying rent to the new landlords, but the landlords have sought ejectment for re-building and re-construc­tion of the entire building according to the D.I.T. plan which prohibits the use of the premises for any commercial purposes. Both the trial Court and the lower Appel­late Court held that the appellant's shop room is required <em>bonafide</em> by the landlord for the purpose of rebuilding and recons­truction. The High Court declined to interfere with the concurrent decision on a revisional application.<br/><br/>3. Dr. Kamal Hossain, learned Counsel for the appellant, has criticized the observation of the High Court Division that the finding that the landlords <em>bonafide</em> required the shop-room is a finding of fact which can­not be gone into on a revisional application. Dr. Hossain contends that the revisional court has got jurisdiction to see whether the finding as to <em>bonafide</em> requirement has been based on proper  consideration of evidence on record  particularly on correct Interpretation of section 18 of the Pre­mises Rent Control Ordinance which re­fers to <em>'bonafide</em> requirement'. Relying upon the two decisions in the cases already referred to, Dr. Hossain contends that "<em>bonafide</em> requirement" is not a mere wish, whim or fancy of the landlord, but it means actual necessity of the premises by the landlord. In support of this contention the learned Counsel has referred to the Advocate Commissioner's Report, supported by a photograph of the premises, which shows that the shop-room in question has not been affected by the recons­truction of the building according to the approved plan. He has pointed out that in the original plan this shop-room stood outside the proposed reconstruction; but subse­quently the plan was revised and reconstruc­tion was made accordingly; but still the shop-room remained unaffected, and as such, the requirement of the shop-room is not <em>'bonafide'</em> within the meaning of section 18 of the Premises Rent Control Ordinance.<br/><br/>4. Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed, learned Counsel for the respondents has, on the other hand, submitted that the approved plan is in respect of the entire premises and that according to the plan the entire premises is meant for residential purposes only, leaving no scope for using any room or part of the premises to be used as a shop or for any other commer­cial purposes. Secondly, the learned Counsel contends, the lease-deed itself prohibits the use of the premises for any commercial purposes. The previous owner, it appears, in disregard of this specific term of the lease allowed the appellant-tenant to set up a shop there. It is argued that this being against the policy of the authority as well as in viola­tion of the lease-deed re-building and re-cons­truction has been taken up according to the approved plan which permits use of the promises only for residential purposes. Advocate Commissioner's report shows that the building, a three-storied one have been recons­tructed without touching or otherwise affect­ing the appellant's shop-room. But in the new scheme of things the entire premises consisting of several rooms is meant for residential purposes only. The shop room of the appellant is required to be demolished for constructing the under-ground sewerage line for the entire premises. It is further found that the tenants occupying other rooms of the building for commercial pur­poses have already been ejected or are under order of ejectment. Even this appellant has been evicted from another room adjacent to the room in question. In view of these circumstances, there is hardly any scope for using this particular room for commercial purposes. The finding that the shop room is bonafide required by the landlord is based on proper consideration of materials on record as well as on correct interpretation of section 18. We find no substance in the contention raised on behalf of the appellant.<br/><br/>The appeal is dismissed without how­ever any order as to costs.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
