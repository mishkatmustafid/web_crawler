No. 40 of 1974.)<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Judgment</strong></span><br/><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Badrul Haider Chowdhury J.— </strong>This appeal by, special, leave is directed against the jud­gment of the High Court Division, in Second Appeal No. 40 of 1974.<br/><br/>2. Defendant is the appellant. Plaintiff-respondent instituted a suit under section 77 of the Registration Act. Plaintiff’s case was that the defendant No.1 entered into a contract with the plaintiff to sell the disputed land and in pursuance of that contract defend­ant No.1 executed a sale deed in favour of the plaintiff on 24.4.67 on receipt of a consideration of Rs. 1000/-. Thereafter, defendant No.1, however, refused to adroit the execution of the deed when the Sub-Registrar visited her commission. An appeal was preferred Before the Registrar but the same was dismissed. Hence the plaintiffs brought the suit under section   77 of the Registration Act.<br/>The learned Munsif dismissed the suit holding that the plaintiff had failed to prove the execution of the document Ext.1 and the passing of consideration of the same and further found that Ext. 1 was a product of fraudulent act.                       <br/><br/>3. An appeal was filed before the learned Subordinate Judge. The appellate court below considered the evidence and found that the defendants  did not deny the execu­tion of the deed in their written statement but their case was that the L.T.Is of defen­dant No.1 were obtained on blank stamp papers for causing mutation of the Heba land. It may be mentioned that the defendant No.1, Gulshan Bibi gifted away the suit land to her sons by a deed of heba and also gifted away the other lands by another deed of heba to her daughter both dated 30.6.67, whereas the sale-deed in question was executed by her on 24.4.67 Hence the defence tried to make out a case that L.T. Is of defendant No. 1 had been taken on blank stamp papers on the plea of muta­ting the heba land and the sale-deed was created fraudulently. The appellate court below considered the scope of section 77 of the Act and concluded that the investigation in such suit should be confined to the question whether or not defendant No.1 had executed the sale-deed as alleged by the plaintiff. (Evidence disclosed that the defendant No.1 had executed the document. In this view of the matter the appellate, court below could not place any reliance on the defence and accordingly direc­ted the registration of the deed failing which the deed could be registered through court.) The appeal was, therefore, allowed.<br/><br/>4. In second appeals the High Court Divi­sion came to the conclusion that the appel­late court below was correct inasmuch as the scope of a suit under section 77 is very limited namely, only to the question of execution by the defendant. In this view of the matter the second appeal was dismissed.<br/>Mr. M. Gholam Rabbani appearing for the defendant-appellant contended that under, section 77 of the Registration Act, the question of the genuineness of the deed is a paramount question and whether a deed was obtained fraudulently and collusively can be raised and decided in a suit under section 77 of the Registration Act and the learned Single Judge was wrong in leaving this question for decision in a future suit by the aggrieved person.<br/><br/>5. Leave was granted to consider this question.<br/>It is well settled that in a suit under this section the court is only concerned whether the document is executed by the person by whom it is alleged to have been executed and not its validity. The question of its validity must be determined in a suit property framed for that purpose. The Court, therefore, will not go to deal with such question, namely, that it is void for want of consideration or that was fraudulently obtained. The decision in <strong><em>8 DLR, 648</em></strong> clinches the issue. The Dhaka High Court considered the decisions of various High Courts, namely, <strong><em>AIR 1932 Cal. 588. AIR 1921 Lahore 136, 14 C.W N.12</em></strong> and came to the conclusion that sec­tion 77 is so limited that it admits of no other defence than the consideration whether the document was executed by the person by whom it is alleged to be executed.<br/><br/>6. Section 77 is to be understood in the light of other provisions of this Act. Part XII deals with cases on refusal of registration. Section 72 provides for an appeal to the Registrar from orders of Sub-registrar refu­sing registration on a ground other than denial of execution and section 73 provides for an application to a Registrar where a Sub-registrar refuses to register on the ground o denial of execution. Section 76 applies to order of refusal by a Registrar made under section 72 as well as under section 75 Sec­tion 77 provides for a suit if the Registrar refused to order a document to be registered It is only when the Registrar refuses to regis­ter a document under section 72 or 76 that a suit can be filed within 30 days of order of refusal In this case Sub-registrar refused to register the document when appeal was filed which was also dismissed. Therefore, the question for, consideration is confined to the question of the execution of the document<br/><br/>7. The Court in a suit under section 77 merely confines it§ inquiry as to the question of execution of the deed. The decision in <strong><em>Rashiuddin Vs. Naresh 8 DLR Dhaka 648 </em></strong>made correct exposition of law and we have no hesitation in placing reliance on it<br/><br/>8. The argument of Mr. Gholam Rabbani that the fraudulent act or the non-payment of consideration is integral question of genuineness of the document is attractive but on scrutiny it does not hold good.<br/><br/>9. The rulings of the various High Courts are uniform on this point namely that the .question whether document is valid or forged or non-receipt of consideration, etc. are not within the scope of a suit under section 77. The only question is whether the document had been executed. In this case that was not denied. Reliance was placed on <strong><em>17 DLR, 476</em></strong>. That decision had no manner of appli­cation. An interesting feature of this case was that that sale-deed war registered in 1.3.84, in pursuant of the order of the High Court Division dated 5.12.83 and though the leave petition was filed on 4.2.82 no attempt was made, to stay the operation of the order of the High Court Division. In that context Mr. Rabbani cited <strong><em>17 DLR 476</em></strong>. Be that as it may, the plaintiffs are in possession in pursuance of the execution of the sale-deed in question and the same had been registered as has been noticed already. In this view of the matter the appeal is dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
