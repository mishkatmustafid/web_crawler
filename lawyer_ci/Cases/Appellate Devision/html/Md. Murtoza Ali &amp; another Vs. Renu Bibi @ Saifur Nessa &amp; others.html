Abdul Matin J.-</strong> These two petitions for leave to appeal Nos. 1055 and 1056 of 2006 are directed against the judgment and order dated 29.03.2006 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision Nos.1805 and 1806 of 1994 making the Rule absolute and reversing the judgment and order dated 14.02.1994 passed by the then learned Subordinate Judge, Artho Rin Adalat, Sylhet in Miscellaneous Appeal  No.31 of 1993 (heard analogously with Miscellaneous Appeal No. 32 of 1993) reversing the judgment and order dated 08.03.1993 passed by the learned Senior  Assistant Judge, Sadar Court, Sylhet in Miscellaneous Case No.19 of 1992 (heard  analogously with Miscellaneous Case No.20 of 1992).                                             <br/><br/>2. Both the petitions being disposed of by the same judgment and common questions of law and fact arising therein, the two leave petitions are disposed of by this sin­gle judgment.<br/><br/>3. The respondent No.1 as pre-emptor filed Miscellaneous Case being No.102 of 1980 in the Court of the then learned Munsif, Sadar Court, Sylhet and subse­quently the cases was transferred to the Court of learned Assistant Judge, Sylhet and renumbered as 19 of 1992. The pre-emptor filed another Miscellaneous Case being No. 103 of 1980 and subsequently the case was renumbered as 20 of 1992.<br/><br/>4. The case of the pre-emptor respondent, in short, is that he is the co-sharer of the case land and other lands by inheritance with opposite party Nos.3 to 6; opposite party Nos. 3 to 6 transferred 1.80 acres of land to pre-emptee opposite party Nos. 1 and 2 on 08.02.1977 and 03.02.1979 with­out serving any notice under Section 89 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act or without any knowledge of the petitioner. Petitioner filed 2 (two) separate case for each transfer as stated above; the petitioner is a married woman living with her hus­band; she came on Naiyor to her father's home and came to know about the disput­ed sale on 10.03.1980 and thereafter obtained certified copies of the kabalas and filed the pre-emption cases after mak­ing deposit of the value of the case land together with 10% compensation money.<br/><br/>5. The pre-emptee petitioners entered appearance wherein opposite party No.1 also represented opposite party No.2 on the strength of a power of attorney in his favour; they filed written objection deny­ing the allegations of preemptor petitioner and asserted that the pre-emptor claims for pre-emption is without any cause of action and barred by limitation; their specific case was that the case land originally belonged to Syed Ali who died leaving behind Rahima Bibi and two sons oppo­site party Nos. 3 and 4, two daughters opposite party Nos.5 and 6, the then minor Renu Bibi (respondent No.1 herein) the settlement record of the land belonging to Syed Ali was recorded in the name of all his above named heirs; thereafter on the death of Rahima Bibi pre-emptor petition­er opposite party Nos. 3 to 6 inherited the property of Syed Ali; the pre-emptor peti­tioner was given in marriage to one police officer by her brother opposite party Nos. 3 and 4, pre-emptee opposite parties came to know from opposite party No.3 on 25th Poush 1385 B.S. pre-emptor petitioner has gifted her share of the property to opposite party No.3 and on 1370 B.S. by oral gift, thereafter opposite party No.1 went to the house of opposite party Nos.3-4 and came to know definitely that the pre-emptor petitioner actually gifted her share of the property to opposite party Nos.3 and 4; the negotiation for sale of the case property was made by the pre-emptor and in her presence price of the case land was fixed at Tk. 30000/- that thereafter 2(two) kabalas each for 90 decimals of land one dated 03.02.1977 and other dated 08.02.1977 the opposite party Nos.1 and 2 got transfer of the case land from owner opposite party Nos. 3 to 4 and have been possessing the land since purchase; after purchase the pre-emptee filed Miscellaneous Case No.1920/79-80 and separated the khatian in their names and paid development cost and spent also Tk.10,560/- on improvement of land; due to increase of price of the land the oppo­site party Nos.3 and 4 managed to filed the pre-emption cases in the name of their sis­ter for wrongful gain. The case is hit by waiver estoppel and acquiescence. The pre-emption case is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>6. The learned Assistant Judge allowed the Miscellaneous Case Nos.19 and 20 of 1992 by the same judgment and the pre-emptee preferred Miscellaneous Appeal Nos.31 and 32 of 1993 and both the Miscellaneous appeals were allowed by the learned Special Judge and judgment and order of the trial court was set aside.<br/><br/>7. As against the judgment and order of the appellate court the pre-emptor filed Civil Revision Nos.1805 and 1806 of 1994 and the High Court Division after hearing made the Rules absolute in both civil revisions and set aside the judgment and order of the court of appeal below and restored those of the trial court. The pre-emptee petitioners have challenged the judgment of the High Court Division in both the leave petitions.<br/><br/>8. The learned Counsel for the petitioners submits that the finding of fact arrived at by the appellate court being the final court of facts, the High Court Division had no jurisdiction to disturb the final finding of facts without reversing the finding of the appellate court.<br/><br/>9. In this case admittedly the pre-emptor is a co-sharer. It is also not disputed that he filed the pre-emption case within four months of the date of knowledge of the transfer, but the court of appeal made out a case of waiver and acquiescence from the so called attending circumstances without reference to any evidence that the pre-emptor participated in the talk of sale or consented to the transfer.<br/><br/>10. It appears that both the trial court and the High Court Division rightly held that the pre-emptor being a co-sharer having filed the case within the statutory period of limitation is entitled to pre-emption as prayed for and committed no illegality in allowing the pre-emption in favour of the respondent pre-emptor.<br/>We find no merit in these petitions which are accordingly dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
