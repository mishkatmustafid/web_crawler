Abdul Matin J.-</strong> These review peti­tions for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 04.12.2007 passed by this Division dismissing the civil petition for leave to appeal No.1055 of 2006 and affirming the judgment and order dated 29.03.2006 of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.1805 of 1994 reversing the judgment and order dated 14.02.1994 of the then Subordinate Judge, Artha Rin Adalat, Sylhet in Miscellaneous Appeal No.31 of 1994 and affirming the judgment and order dated 08.03.1993 of the learned Assistant Judge, Additional Court, Sadar Sylhet in Miscellaneous Case (Pre-emption) No.19 of 1992.<br/><br/>2. The facts of the case are that respondent Nos. 2-5 sold 1,80 acres of land of the case plots to the petitioners by 2(two) deeds dated 03.02.1977 and 08.02.1977. The respondent No.1 claiming to be a co-shar­er by inheritance (being sister of respon­dent Nos. 2-5) filed two miscellaneous cases for pre-emption under Section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950. The Miscellaneous Case No.102 of 1980 was filed against sale under the deed dated 03.02.1977 and the Miscellaneous Case No.103 of 1980 was filed against sale under deed dated 08.02.1977 and the said Miscellaneous Case No. 102 of 1980 on transfer was renumbered as Miscellaneous Case No.19 of 1992 of the learned Assistant Judge, Additional Court, Sylhet and the other one was renumbered as Miscellaneous Case No. 20 of 1992 of the learned Assistant Judge, Additional Court, Sylhet and both were tried analo­gous and disposed of by a single judgment dated 08.03.1993 allowing both the Miscellaneous Cases.<br/><br/>3. The case of the respondent No.1 as pre-emptor, in short, is that she is the co-shar­er in the case land with the respondent Nos.2-5. The respondent Nos. 2-5 trans­ferred 1.80 acres of land of case plot Nos. 2630, 2631 and 2632 to the petition­ers by 2 (two) deeds dated 03.02.1977 and 08.02.1977 each for .90 acres without serving any notice under Section 89 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 and without her knowledge the petitioner being a married women lived with her husband and came to know about the sale when she on Nayor came to her paternal house on 10.03.1980 and thereafter defi­nitely learnt about it on obtaining certified copies of the deeds of sale and filed the pre-emption cases on making deposit of value of case land as per deed with 10% compensation as required by law and total quantity of land held by her would be far less than 100 bighas.<br/><br/>4. The petitioners as pre-emptees contest­ed the case by filing written objection denying the allegations and contending amongst others, that the claim for pre­emption is barred by limitation, that there is no cause of action, that on getting the proposal for sale of the case land the pre-emptee petitioners on query came to know from respondent Nos.2-3 that   they brought up the pre-emptor respondent from childhood on the death of their moth­er and gave her in marriage with a Police Officer, that the respondent No. 2 had also informed them on 1370 B.S. that the pre-emptor had gifted her inherited portion of land to respondent Nos.2-3, that after­wards the pre-emptee petitioners went to the house of respondent Nos. 2-3 wherein they learnt from the pre-emptor herself about the gift and that the price of the case land was fixed in her presence at Tk. 30,000/-and thereafter, deeds dated 03.02.1977 and 08.02.1977 were regis­tered that the petitioners had been possess­ing the same by mutating their names vide Miscellaneous Case No.1920 of 1979-80 and paying tax on opening a separate khatian and developing the land, that the price of the land had increased in the meantime and so the respondent Nos. 2-3 have collusively set up the pre-emptor respondent to file the Miscellaneous Cases to make wrongful gain and so the petitioners prayed for dismissal of the Miscellaneous Cases.<br/><br/>5. In the trial court of learned Assistant Judge both the Miscellaneous Cases were heard analogous and the pre-emptor respondent examined 2 (two) witnesses and exhibited the deeds and the pre-emptee petitioners examined 3 (three) wit­nesses and exhibited some documents. After hearing the learned Assistant Judge by a single judgment and order dated 08.03.1993 allowed both the Miscellaneous Cases on contest against the pre-emptee petitioners and <em>ex-parte</em> against the rest.<br/><br/>6. Being aggrieved by the judgment and order of the learned Assistant Judge the pre-emptee petitioners preferred two Miscellaneous Appeals Nos.31 of 1993 and 32 of 1993 and those were heard anal­ogously by the then Subordinate Judge and Artha Rin Adalat, Sylhet who allowed both the Miscellaneous Appeals by a sin­gle judgment and order dated 14,03.1994 and set aside the judgment and order of the learned Assistant Judge holding amongst others that the pre-emption was barred as there was sufficient evidence on record showing acquiescence and estoppel of the pre-emptor in respect of the sale of the case land and that the conduct of the respondent Nos. 2-3 lend support to the allegation of collusion with the pre-emp­tor in filing the case.<br/><br/>7. The pre-emptor respondent thereafter filed Civil Revision No. 1805  of 1994 against the   judgment and order in Miscellaneous Appeal No.31 of 1993 and Civil Revision No.1806 of 1994 against the judgment and order in Miscellaneous Appeal No.32 of 1993 in the High Court Division and the two revisional applica­tions were heard analogous by a single Judge who by a single judgment and order dated  29.03.2006  made  the Rules absolute, set aside the judgment of the appellate court and affirmed the judgment of the trial court.<br/><br/>8. Being aggrieved by the judgment and order of the High Court Division the pre-emptee petitioners preferred Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1055 of 2006 against the judgment and order in Civil Revision No. 805 of 1994 and Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1056 of 2006 against that in Civil Revision No.1806 of 1994 before this Division. This Division by a single judgment dated 04.12.2007 dismissed both the leave peti­tions holding that the court of appeal made out a case of waiver and acquiescence from so called attending circumstances without reference to any evidence that the pre-emptor participated in talk of sale or consented to sale.<br/><br/>9. These pre-emptee petitioners had pro­duced certified copy  of a deed dated 05.03.1980 whereby the respondent No.3 had sold .20 acres of land of Case Plot No.2630 to one Mahbub Elahi but the trial court did not mark it 'exhibit' as the pre-emptee allegedly could not legally prove the deed as is evident from the judgment of the trail court. The pre-emptee petition­ers have had certified copies of two other deeds being deed No.8204 dated 05.03.1980 whereby the respondent No.2 sold .20 acres of land of Case Plot No.2630 to Mahbub Elahi and deed No.8206 dated 05.03.1980 whereby respondent Nos.4 and 5 sold .20 acres of land of case plot Nos.2630 and 2632 to Mahbub Elahi and also the related khatian but being not advised by their advocates did not adduce those in evidence before the trial court. Though the aforesaid sales from the case plots were effected on 05.03.1980 immediately before the filing of the miscellaneous cases for pre-emp­tion on 16.04.1980 but the pre-emptor has not so far filed any case for pre-emption in respect of sale of those land by her sisters herein respondent Nos.4-5 rather had admitted in cross-examination that she had consented to the sales of her brothers. If the aforesaid three deeds and khatian were produced and considered by the courts the decisions might have been dif­ferent and in favour of these pre-emptee petitioners. The said deeds being certified copies, the court is to presume the deeds as genuine under Section 79 of the Evidence Act and that the execution of the deeds having not been denied by the respondent Nos. 2-5 the same need not be proved by attesting witness as per provi­sion of Section 68 of the Evidence Act. The learned Assistant Judge was wrong in not considering the certified copy of one of the said deeds on the ground of not being proved.<br/><br/>10. Heard the learned Counsel and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.It appears that question of limitation was correctly decided by the trial court and the High Court Division and this court approved of the finding of the High Court Division while dismissing the civil peti­tion for leave to appeal.<br/><br/>11. We find no ground for reviewing the judgment of this court and accordingly the review petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
