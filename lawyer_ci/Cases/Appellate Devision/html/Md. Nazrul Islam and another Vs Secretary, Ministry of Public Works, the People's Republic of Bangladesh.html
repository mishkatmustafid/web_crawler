Abdul Matin J.</strong>- This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 27.01.2009 passed by the High Court Division in First Appeal No. 114 of 1996 dismissing the appeal and affirming the judgment and decree dated 27.04.1996 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, 2nd Court, Dhaka in Title Suit No.309 of 1994 dismissing the suit.<br/><br/>2.  The petitioners as plaintiffs filed Title Suit No.309 of 1994 contending, <em>inter alia,</em> that the plaintiffs (the present petitioner) are entitled to a decree declaring their entitle­ment to get an offer from the defendants to sell the scheduled abandoned property under the Government circular/policy as being a valid allottee in possession.<br/><br/>3. The suit property originally belonged to the then Government of East Pakistan which was subsequently leased out to a Non-Bengali refugee. After 1971 the said Non-Bengali refugee was not found in the suit property known as 1/3, Noorjahan Road, Mohammadpur, Dhaka. Therefore by opera­tion of the President Order 16 of 1972 it was declared as an abandoned property and it was listed as an abandoned property. The suit property was then allotted to the father/husband of the plaintiffs, Sona Miah, a Police <em>Habilder</em> serving under the Government of Bangladesh, by allotment letter dated 03.02.1973 and handed over possession on 05.02.1973. The said allottee Sona Miah paid rent for suit property firstly 11/2 and then 5% of his salary as a Police Habilder as per the demand note dated 15.05.1975 issued by the defendants.<br/><br/>4. The said allottee, Sona Miah, had been living in the suit property with his family members including the plaintiffs only and he had been paying rent for the suit proper­ty regularly from his salary until he retired from the Government service on 1982. Thereafter, Sona Miah tried to pay the rent from the pension allowance he received from the Government but the defendants refused to take rent.<br/><br/>5. The predecessor of the plaintiffs, Sona Miah, made applications dated 29, 06.1994 to the abandoned property authority for an offer of sale of the suit property under the Government circular bearing memo No. Shakha-5/AP-1M-26/83 (ANG-SHA)/110 dated 02.03.1986 but the defen­dants delayed the offer for a long time with­out giving any answer at the investigation of some corrupt employees and some interest­ed persons who were conspiring to give offer letter to another person. On 30.11.1994 the predecessor of the plaintiffs, Sona Miah died leaving behind the plain­tiffs. Thereafter the defendants served notice to evict the plaintiffs from the suit property, hence the suit.<br/><br/>6. The defendant Nos.1 to 4 and defendant No.5 filed two separate written statements contending, <em>inter alia,</em> that the suit property was originally allotted to Sona Miah by the defendants and accordingly a demand note was also issued in his name. Sona Miah has been in possession with the plaintiffs.<br/><br/>7. Later on, one Maleka Begum in the name of Sona Miah filed a case in the Court of set­tlement claiming the ownership of the suit property being Settlement Case No.701 of 1988 which was rejected by the Court in the year of 1990 and then filed a writ petition being Writ Petition No.106 of 1994 in the High Court Division which was also reject­ed. Thereafter, she filed a Civil Appeal being Civil Petition No.181 of 1994 before the Appellate Division which was also rejected.<br/><br/>8. The suit has been filed by the plaintiff No.1 Nazrul Islam and the defendant No.2 Mrs. Feroza Begum but aforesaid Maleka Begum and the said Feroza Begum are the same person. When the said Maleka Begum failed to get the ownership then she again became Feroza Begum as the widow of the said Sona Miah.<br/><br/>9. The said suit property was offered for sale to the defendant No.5 as a Shaheed family.<br/><br/>10. After hearing both the parties, the learned Subordinate Judge, 2nd Court, Dhaka passed the judgment and decree dated 27.04.1996 in Title Suit No.309 of 1994 dismissing the petitioners' suit on con­test.<br/><br/>11. Being aggrieved by the above judgment and decree the petitioners preferred an appeal being First Appeal No.114 of 1996 before the High Court Division. After hear­ing the parties in the said appeal the High Court Division was pleased to pass judg­ment and order dated 27.01.2009 dismissing the First Appeal No. 114 of 1996.<br/><br/>12. As against the judgment and order of the High Court Division the petitioners have filed this petition for leave to appeal.<br/><br/>13. Heard Tafailur Rahman, the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioners and Mahmudul Islam, the learned Counsel appearing for the respondents and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/><br/>14. It appears that the High Court Division found that the trial Court rightly held that the petitioners had no right or interest in the suit property and therefore the very suit was not maintainable and the Government never made any offer or expressed its desire to sell the suit property in favour of the plaintiff. The plaintiff’s predecessor was only an allot­tee under the Government having no right or interest in the property itself.<br/><br/>In such circumstances the High Court Division committed no illegality in dismiss­ing the appeal.<br/>We find no substance in this petition which is accordingly dismissed.<br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
