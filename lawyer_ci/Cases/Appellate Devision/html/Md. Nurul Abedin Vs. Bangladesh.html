Abdul Matin J.-</strong> These petitions for leave to appeal are directed against the judgment and order dated 04.03.2009 passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No.4623 (heard analogously with Writ Petition No. 4913 of 2008) discharg­ing the Rule arising out of Auction pro­ceeding published in the Daily Jhanakantha on 25.04.2008 by writ respondent No. 4 for selling the property of the petitioner.<br/>2. The facts, in short, are that the petition­er filed Writ Petition No. 4623 of 2008 before the High Court Division against the publication of re-auction notice in the Daily Janakantha by respondent No.4 fix­ing a date on 12.05.2008 for selling the petitioners allotted plots, structure stand­ing thereon and some scrap machineries acquired by BSCIC.<br/><br/>3. The case of the writ petitioner was that he is the proprietor of M/S. Friends Chemical Industries and his business part­ner was Mr. Md. Liaquat Ali of 240/1, South Paikpara, Mirpur, Dhaka. The peti­tioner and his partner applied for allotment of an industrial plot in BSCIC Industrial Area, Norsingdi and the Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation considered the application and allotted plot being plot Nos.A-15 and 1-16 measuring more or less 9000 sq feet for the purpose of setting up of a chemical industry vide allotment letter dated 03.04.1990. Thereafter the petitioner and his partner as per allotment letter dated 03.04.1990 deposited 1,25,208.00 at a time in cash and thereafter paid all the installments and other payable premium without any default and they set up a chemical industry on the said allotted plots by constructing a factory building and importing machiner­ies and other sophisticated equipments from abroad by spending huge amount of money from their own source.<br/><br/>4. The petitioner and his partner entered into an agreement of hire purchase with the respondent No.2 on 16.09.1991 for avail­ing of Tk.9, 25,000.00 (nine lac twenty five thousand) payable with interest at the rate of 8.5% along with half yearly rent and the petitioner and his partner executed a prom­issory note to that effect. But neither the petitioner nor his partner executed any reg­istered or unregistered power of attorney or any other kind of authorization whatsoever empowering the respondents for selling out the machineries; laboratory equipments, factory building allotted plots and other properties  straight way without having decree from court. Even the hire purchase deed itself does not empower respondents to sell those valuable assets of the petition­er in a managed auction under Sections 12 and 33 of <em>Artha Rin Adalat Ain</em>, 2003.<br/><br/>5. The Managing partner of the petitioner Md. Liaquat Ali subsequently surrendered his portion of share in favour of the peti­tioner with the prior approval of respon­dent no.2 corporation.<br/><br/>6. The respondent No.2 without serving notice or giving any warning upon the petitioner behind his back published an auction notice in the Daily Janakantha on 25.04.2008 fixing the date on 14.05.2008 for auction for selling the petitioner's allot­ted plots, standing factory building along with machineries, apparatus, laboratory equipments violating the provisions of Sections 12(3), 69 of Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and also the relevant clause of agreement for hire purchase deed.<br/><br/>7. The High Court Division discharged the Rules and directed BSCIC to proceed with the auction sale of the properties in ques­tion in accordance with law.<br/><br/>8. As against the order of the High Court Division the petitioner has filed these peti­tions for leave to appeal.<br/><br/>9. Heard the learned Counsel and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/><br/>10. It appears that in the earlier writ peti­tion direction was given to the BSCIC to accept the entire outstanding dues from the petitioner if it was paid within 7 days and in the default to proceed with the mortgage sale and admittedly the petition­er defaulted and therefore the High Court Division committed no illegality in dis­charging the Rule with direction to pro­ceed with the auction sale.<br/><br/>11. However if the entire outstanding dues has been paid in the meantime by the peti­tioner then auction sale proceeding may be dropped.<br/>Accordingly both the leave petitions are dismissed with above observation.<br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
