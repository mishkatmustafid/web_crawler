Nurul Islam, Senior Advocate instructed by Mrs. Sufia Khatun, Advocate-on-Record-For Respondent.</em><br/><br/><strong>Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1534 of 2008.</strong><br/>(From the judgment and order dated the 5th day of June, 2008 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.1716 of 2006).<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Judgment</strong></span></div><strong>                </strong><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mohammad Fazlul Karim J.-</strong> This petition for Leave to Appeal is directed  against the judgment and order dated 05.06.2008 passed by the High Court  Division in Civil Revision No.1716 of 2006 discharging the Rule affirming the judgment and order dated 09.05.2006 passed by the Additional District Judge, Court No.5, Dhaka dismissing the Civil  Revision No.187 of 2006 affirming the order dated 10.04.2006 passed by the Assistant Judge, 6th Court Dhaka in Title Execution Case No.4 of 2004 rejected the Application for appointment of advocate Commissioner.<br/><br/>2. The facts of the case, in short, are that the plaintiff instituted the Title Suit No. 253 of 1998 in the 6th Court of Assistant Judge, Dhaka impleading the defendants praying for a decree for declaration of title and recovery of khas possession in the suit land alleging his prior posses­sion and subsequent dispossession by the contesting defendants.<br/><br/>3. The defendant Nos.1 and 2 contested the suit by filing written statement deny­ing the plaintiffs title and prior posses­sion in the suit land and asserting their own title and long possession in the suit land.<br/><br/>4. Mr. Mahbubey Alam learned Counsel, appearing for the petitioners submitted that the defendants have got their homestead on the suit land, as such it is necessary to ascertain the position of the structure by appointing an Advocate Commissioner, the Courts below erred in rejecting the prayer of the defendant in not allowing the prayer of the petitioners. The learned Counsel fur­ther submitted that since a decree having been passed in the suit in respect of some structure situated on the suit land this Division found that the defendants have got their homestead on the suit land and without ascertaining the same by appointing Advocate Commissioner, it will be very difficult to execute the decree, the High Court Division com­mitted and error in not allowing the application of the defendants  under Order XXVI rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure without considering the aforesaid aspect.  <br/><br/>5. It appears from the record that the suit land was specifically mentioned in the plaintiff of the suit and there was no uncertainty or vagueness in the land which has been decreed by the Court of Appeal below and maintained upto this Division. It further appears that the subject matter of the suit including the description of the property, as described in the schedule to the plaint, is sufficient to identify the suit land and the execut­ing Court cannot go beyond the decree by allowing a local .investigation to ascertain the suit land. During trial of the suit the contesting defendants could have raised the plea of identity of the suit land could have made a prayer for local investigation but such prayer can­not be entertainable by the executing Court, as the executing Court cannot go behind the decree.<br/><br/>6. In view of the above, we find no sub­stance in the submissions of the learned Counsel for the petitioner.<br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
