The appellant as plaintiff filed a suit for partition of the schedule property stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that Mangia Sk. had 6 annas 8 pies share in C.S. Khatian No. 264 and 269 des­cribed in Schedule Ka and Kha respectively and that he had 8 annas share in C.S. Khatian No. 267 and 271, the properties in Schedule "Ga" and "Gha" thereby claiming 2.34 acres of land to their share.<br/><br/>3. Defendants contested the suit stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit land belonged to Uli Fakir who died leaving behind two sons namely, Mangia Sk. and Bocha Sk. and two daughters   Kulsum and Alimunnessa that Mangia transferred 1.33 acres of land of Schedule Kha and also 91½ decimals of land out of Schedule Ka; that the plaintiffs are not entitled to get the lands as claimed by them.<br/><br/>4. The trial Court decreed the suit giving the plaintiff a share amounting to 2.82 acres. On appeal by the plaintiff the said Schedule was reduced to 2.01 acre by the learned Sub­ordinate Judge. The appellate Court below held that admittedly the property belonged entirely to Uli Fakir and on the basis of the admitted heirs left behind by the said Uli Fakir held that the plaintiff's predecessor Mangia Sk. had a share of 5 annas 4 pies according to Muslim Law of Inheritance and in that view of the matter the plaintiffs are entitled to 2.01 acres of land.<br/><br/>5. The plaintiffs moved a review applica­tion before the learned Subordinate Judge which, however, was rejected and thereafter plaintiffs moved the High Court Division in revision. The learned Single Judge repelled the contention that in the absence of any cross appeal or cross objection the appellate Court below could not reduce the plaintiffs' share in the property which was found by the trial Court. It was pointed out by the High Court Division that the plaintiff himself had preferred the appeal and the appellate Court after consideration of evidence on record found that the plaintiff was entitled to a re­duced share and on calculation the said share was reduced for which no objection could be taken. In this view of the matter the revisional application was rejected summarily.<br/><br/>6. Leave was granted to consider the question whether in the absence of any cross appeal filed by the defendants the appellate Court below could reduce thus share of the plaintiff-appellant on a misreading of evidence that the entire property consisting of four plots originally belonged to Uli Fakir and Mangai Fakir inherited one-third share in all the four plots.<br/><br/>7. The bone of contention is whether the property belonged to Uli Fakir entirely or whether Mangai Fakir had 8 annas share  in C.S. Khatian Nos. 261 and 271 as alleged by the plaintiff. Admittedly Uli Fakir left be­hind two sons Mangai Sk. and Bocha Sk and two daughters Kulsum and Alimunnessa so by law of Inheritance Mangai inherited 5 annas four pies i.e. one third share in the suit property. The finding of fact that the total quantum of suit property is 12.77 acre and consequently Mangai having inherited one third share inherited 4.26 acres. The next admitted position is that Mangai transferred 2.25 acres and therefore he was left with on 2.01 acres. This was found by the appellant Court below. The appellate Court below pointed out that the defendants in paragraph 5 the written statement challenged the contention of the plaintiff that he had 8 annas shares in C.S. 267 and 271.   It was asserted that Uli Fakir was the owner of this property<br/><br/>8. No evidence was led by the plaint as to how he acquired this property, 1 only contention of the plaintiff was that it was recorded in his name and his brother Bocha but to claim it as self-acquired property in a partition suit, some, more evidence was necessary for the plaintiff to prove the claim which was not done in this case. Appellate Court below rightly pointed out that the trial Court had taken into, consideration of the quantum of land and the claimant was the heir of the common ancestor but in calculating the share it was mistakenly incre­ased in favour of the plaintiff when by the law of Inheritance he could claim only one-third of the share left by his ancestor and on calculating his share it was reduced to 2.01 acre from 2.82.<br/><br/>9. Mr. B. N. Chowdhury appearing for the plaintiff appellant contended that this redu­ction was arbitrary and without jurisdiction. There is no force in the argument:<br/>Order 41 Rule 33 is in the following terms:<br/>''<strong>33. Power of Court of Appeal.— </strong>The Appellate Court shall have power to pass any decree and make any order which ought to have been passed or made and to pass or make such further or other decree or order as the case may require and this power may be exercised by the Court notwithstanding that the appeal is as to part only of the decree and may be exercised in favour of all or any of the respondents or parties, although such respondents or parties may not have filed any appeal or objec­tion:<br/>Provided that the Appellate Court shall not make any order under section 35A in pursuance of any objection on which the Court from whose decree the appeal is preferred has omitted or refused to make such order." <br/>The Appellate Court can pass any order as the case may require "notwithstanding that the appeal is as to part only of the decree and may be exercised in favour of all or any of the respondent or parties although such respondents or parties may not have filed any appeal   or objection." Illustration appended to the Rule highlights the point: <br/>"A claims a sum of money as due to him from X or Y, and in a suit against both obtains a decree against X, X app­eals and A and Y are respondents. The Appellate Court decides in favour of X. It has power to pass a decree against Y."  <br/>The wording of the rule shows that the appel­late Court may pass any order to do complete justice in disposing of the appeal. This power must be exercised in the interest of and to further ends of justice. Contention of Mr. Chowdhury is that the application of this rule would mean the re-adjustment of the rights of the parties when the matter had already been settled. This contention over-looks the rule that the appellate Court may pass such order although the respondents might not have filed any appeal or objection.<br/><br/>10. In the case of <strong><em>B. Iswarayya Versus Swarnam Iswarayya 35 Calcutta Weekly Notes page 1185</em></strong>, the Privy Council dismissed the contention that by way of application of Order 41, Rule 33 the appellate Court could not increase the allowance of the wife in an appeal by the husband and not filed by wife. In that case the Court made subsequent order increasing the amount of permanent alimony granted to wife on judicial separation on an application by the wife for increment of allo­wance of self and children which was partially granted. The wife did not file any appeal but the husband filed appeal against such order. The appellate Court took the view that the children had attained majority and therefore the provision of the children was cut out but by application of Order 41 rule 33 it increased further the personal allowance of the wife.<br/><br/>11. In the case of <strong><em>State of Bihar Vs. Dhukulal Das and others, AIR 1962 Patna page 140</em></strong>. The view was taken that the Court of appeal has got wide power under Order 41 rule 33 in order to do complete justice between the parties and it was pointed out that the illustration of the rule gives indication of the class of cases to which rule 33 would apply e.g. where as a result of interference in fa­vour of the appellant further interference of the decree is rendered necessary to adjust the right of the parties according to jus­tice, equity and good conscious.<br/><br/>12. In the case of <strong><em>Latchandhora Vs. Chinnavadu, AIR 1963 Andra Pradesh 31</em></strong> in a par­tition suit the trial Court decreed the suit holding that the items 3 and 4 as joint family property. On appeal by the defen­dants, though no objection was taken as to item 4, the appellate Court held that items 3 and 4 were self acquired property and exercising powers under Order 41, rule 33 Appe­llate Court gave direction to exclude items 3 and 4 from the property to be parti­tioned. It was observed: <br/>"defendants  10,11 and 42 have not preferred any appeal as to this item but in my view this is a fit case in which I should exercise my power as an appellate Court under order 41 Rule 33 C.P.C. and give a direction that these items should also be excluded from partition." <br/><br/>13. It is unnecessary to multiply instan­ces and it may be noted in passing that in the case of <strong><em>Hamijan Bibi versus Sk. Darog Ali and others, 15 DLR 225</em></strong> a Division Bench of the   Dhaka High Court took the view that the decree passed by the trial Court can be varied by the appellate Court even though there was no cross ap­peal or cross objection and this power is available in the interest of justice.<br/><br/>14. Mr. B.N.Chowdhury cited <strong><em>Farok Ahmed Meah and others versus Lalit Mohan Chowdhury and  others AIR, 1939 Calcutta 582 </em></strong><em>w</em>here it was held that  when the res­pondent has made it clear that he wanted to maintain the decree of the lower court and did not want it to be disturbed, he without preferring any appeal or filing a Memorandum of Cross-objection cannot challenge a finding the result of which would be to destroy in effect the foun­dation on which the part decree was made in favour of the appellant by the lower court rests. This case has no manner of application inasmuch as the defendants in this case at the earliest opportunity challenged the contention of the plaintiff that he was the owner to the extent of 8 annas share in the respective Khatian and their version was that it was an ejmali property belonging to Uli Fakir the common ancestor of the plaintiff. The plaintiff, on perusal of the written statement attempted to amend the plaint but no evidence was given by them to substantiate their contention that this property was not ejmali property.<br/><br/>15. Lastly Mr. Chowdhury submitted a de­cision in the case of <strong><em>Rameshwar Prasad and others Vs. Shambahan Lal Jagannath and ano­ther, AIR 1963 SC 1901</em></strong> where it was held that Order 41 rule 33 is of no greater help, to the contention of the appellants that their appeal should continue even though the appeal by one of them had abated. It was observed- <br/>"However where in a case the legal representatives of the deceased appellant and the surviving appellants are negli­gent in not taking steps for substitution, the Court is not to exercise its discretion in favour of such a party. The discreti­onary power cannot be exercised to nullify the effect of the abatement of the appeal safer as the deceased appellant is concerned''. <br/>This principle is based on law and there is no question about its soundness inasmuch as exercise of such power would lead to the instances of contradictory decrees between the heirs of the deceased appellant and a respon­dent, one passed by the appellate Court and another to the contrary effect by the Court below which has attained finality consequent on the abatement on the appeal itself. This decision, therefore, is of no help to the appellant in this case. On the other hand, in the case of <strong><em>Panna Lal Vs. State of Bombay </em></strong>reported in<strong><em> AIR 1963 SC 1516</em></strong>, Rule 33 was interpreted. It was held that if a party who could file a cross-objection under Order 41 rule 22 has not done so it cannot be said that the Appellate Court can under no circu­mstances give his relief under the provision of Order 41, rule 33. With respect, we are also of the same view and that is a complete answer to the contention raised by the appe­llant in this case. The rule comes into play when the question of doing complete justice between the parties arise. A litigant cannot claim undue advantage on a technicality of procedural law.<br/>In the result therefore this appeal is dis­missed but there will be no order to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
