M.

The nomination paper of the writ petitioner was declared invalid by the Returning Officer on the ground that he is a bank loan defaulter, as per papers submitted before the Returning Officer by the Manager, Rupali Bank Limited, Debuapur Branch, Patuakhali showing that an amount of Tk. 1,82.10,366/- was due to the bank by the writ petit inner.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> We have heard Mr. Musurul Hoque Chowdhury, the learned Counsel for the petitioner and Mr. Fida M. Kamal, the learned Additional Attorney General for the respondents and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> It is not disputed that Rupali Bank obtained a money decree for the amount claimed by them from the Court of Joint District Judge and Artha Rin Adalat, Patuakhali against the writ petitioner. The petitioner without preferring any appeal against the money decree passed against him filed a writ petition challenging the decree.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> The learned Counsel for the petitioner submits that since the writ petition is pending the petitioner should not be treated as a loan defaulter.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> The learned Additional Attorney General on the other hand submits that since no appeal has been preferred against the decree of the Artha Kin Adalat the money decree still stands and is binding upon the petitioner. He further submits that the election process once started should not be disturbed and the election scheduled to be held on 05.04.2006 should not be stayed on the prayer of the writ petitioner who is disqualified to be a candidate being a bank loan defaulter.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, we do not find any cogent reason to interfere with the judgment of the High Court Division.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> Accordingly the petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div></div></div>
