Ruhul Amin J. -</strong>This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment dated March 13, 2004 of a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 1862 of 1991 mak­ing absolute the Rule obtained against the judgment and decree dated March 6, 1991 of the Court of Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Sherpur in Other Appeal No. 77 of 1988 reversing the Judgment and decree dated July 31, 1988 of the Court of Assistant Judge, Sribordi, Sherpur in Other Class Suit No. 64 of 1985 decreeing the same.<br/><br/>2. The suit was filed seeking declaration of title and for recovery of khas posses­sion of the land in suit. It is the case of the plaintiffs that they have purchased the land in suit by the kabala dated January 19, 1980 from defendant No.4, Nahar Ali, who purchased the same from Pyar Mamud, father of defendant Nos. 1-3 by the kabala dated September 19, 1974, that since purchase plaintiffs were possessing the land till they were dispossessed by the principal defen­dants, that defendant No.1, son of Pyar Mamud filed an application before the local Circle Officer under the provision of Ordinance No. 28 of 1976 but the same was dismissed on April 22, 1981, that defendant No.1 in collusion with the personnel of the local Revenue Officer managed to procure a forged order showing allowing the application filed by defendant No.1 and on the basis thereof dispossessed the plaintiff on April 9, 1985, that defendant No.1 did not get any order in his favour from the office of the local Revenue office on the application filed under the provision of Ordinance No. 28 of 1976 and no order for dispossessing the plaintiffs from the land in suit was issued from the office of the local Revenue Office, that by the forged and fabricated order of the Officer of the local Revenue Office brought into existence by the defendant No.1 no title and interest was created in favour of the defendant No.1 in the land in suit, that by the said forged and fabri­cated order defendants have not acquired any title or interest in the land in suit, that in the proceeding initiated upon the application filed by the defendant No.1 in the office of the local Revenue Officer the plaintiffs were not made parties.<br/><br/>3. The suit was contested by the defen­dant Nos. 1-3 by filing written statement denying the material averments made in the plaint. The suit was also contested by defendant Nos.5 and 7 by filing separate sets of written statement upon denying the case of the plaintiffs. The case of the defendants is that Pyar Mamud, father of the defendant Nos. 1-3 was the owner of the land in suit and during economic dis­tress of the year 1974 he sold the land to defendant No.4, that after the death of Pyar Mamud the defendants as well as the heirs of Pyar Mamud filed a petition under the provision of Ordinance No. 28 of 1976 before the Revenue Officer and thereupon Revenue Case No. 809 (XIII) of 1976-77 was registered and the same was allowed by the order dated July 3, 1981, that in pursuant to the order of the Revenue Officer defendants paid Tk. 250/- on August 8, 1981 and obtained the receipt and on May 13, 1985 paid Tk. 250/- and obtained the receipt, that after the payment of first installment Revenue Officer passed order directing the relevant officer to hand over posses­sion of the land in suit to the defendants and the said personnel of the Revenue Office, Sribordi made over possession to the defendants on April 11, 1982 and thereupon filed report as to delivery of possession in the office of the Revenue Officer, that plaintiffs' father impleading defendant Nos. 1, 5 and others initiated a proceeding in the Court of Magistrate on March 7, 1983 under section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure but the same was rejected on September 4, 1983, that while the defendant Nos. 1-3 and other heirs of Pyar Mamud were in possession of the land the defendant No.3 sold 7½ decimals of land to defendant No. 5 on October 13, 1985 and defendant Nos.1 and 2 sold 15½  Decimals of land defendant No.5 on October 12, 1985, that defendant Nos. 1-3's mother and their full sister sold 12 decimals of land to defendant No.7 on October 12, 1985, that defendant Nos. 5 and 7 on the basis of their purchase are in possession of their purchased land.<br/><br/>4. The trial Court considered the Ext.3, the order of the Circle Office (Revenue) dismissing the petition filed by the defendant Nos.  1-3 and others in the light of the provision of Ordinance No. 28 of 1976 and the Ext. C i.e. order of the Circle Officer (Revenue) on the basis whereof it was claimed by the defen­dants that their petition filed under the provision of Ordinance No. 28 of 1976 was allowed and thereupon arrived at the finding that the said Ext. C is not gen­uine and thereupon observed as such what ever the papers filed by the defen­dants in support of their assertion that they did their part what was directed by the order of the Circle Officer (Revenue) can not be accepted and merits no con­sideration. The trial Court also held that from the materials on record it is seen that the defendants in collusion with the personnel of the Circle Office (Revenue) has obtained the order Ext. C and as the order Ext. C is collusive, the subsequent activities of the defendants are not legal and the said activities are the product of collusion between the defendants and the personnel of the Circle Office (Revenue) and that the plaintiffs have established their case. On the aforesaid findings the trial Court decreed the suit.<br/><br/>5. The defendants, in all 4, went on appeal. The appellate Court on consider­ation of the materials on record arrived at the finding that in the absence of the record of the case which was started on the application of the defendants filed under Ordinance No. 28 of 1976 it is dif­ficult to arrive at the finding as to which of the exhibits i.e. Exts.3 and c is gen­uine but as the defendants on the basis of Ext. c has gone into possession of the land in suit and as in pursuant to the Ext. C defendants have paid some of the installments and as such Ext. c carries much more weight than the Ext.3 that in case Ext. c is genuine in that case plain­tiffs' claim of title is not entertainable in law and as such plaintiffs are not entitled to the relief sought in the suit. On the aforesaid findings allowed the appeal and thereupon set aside the judgment and decree appealed.<br/><br/>6. Thereupon the plaintiffs move the High Court Division in revisional juris­diction. The High Court Division in the background of the materials on record did not accept the contention of the defendants that the Circle Officer (Revenue) allowed the petition filed under Ordinance No. 28 of 1976 and thereupon considered the Ext.c as not genuine. The High Court Division on consideration of the evidence of P.W.3 held that the Ext.3 is genuine and the Ext. C is not genuine and the same has been issued by an incompetent person and the Ext. c is product of forgery, that appellate Court while making its deci­sion as regard to the genuineness of the exts. 3 and c did not consider the evi­dence of P.W.3 and as such the finding of the appellate Court as to the genuineness of the Ext. C being contrary to the evi­dence of P.W.3 the same is not sustain­able, that there is no credible evidence from the side of the defendants in sup­port of their contention of paying install­ment on the basis of Ext. c, that the defendants have not filed any receipt showing payment of money on the basis of Ext. C, that defendants on the basis of fraudulent paper i.e. Ext. C entered into the land in suit upon dispossessing the plaintiffs, that since the defendants went into possession of the land in suit upon dispossessing the plaintiffs on the basis of forged and fabricated paper, their pos­session can not be considered to have been obtained legally or it can not be said that the defendants went into pos­session of the land in suit legally, that the Court of appeal below was in serious error in arriving at the finding as to the genuineness of Ext. C upon total disre­gard of the evidence of P.W.3 and other materials on record. On the aforesaid finding High Court Division made the Rule absolute.<br/><br/>7. We have heard the learned Advocate-on-Record and perused the materials in the paper book. It is seen from the judg­ment of the lower appellate Court that the said Court arrived at the finding as regard the genuineness of Ext. c upon surmise and conjecture and that in arriv­ing at the finding as to the genuineness of Ext. c the appellate Court did not at all consider the evidence of P.W.3 who has deposed that the signature appearing in Ext.3 is of the Circle Officer, Revenue, Sribordi and that Ext. C has been issued by an unauthorised person.<br/><br/>8. In the afore state of the matter we do not find any reason to interfere with the judgment of the High Court Division setting aside the judgment and decree of the appellate Court and thereby restoring the judgment and decree of the trial Court.<br/><br/>Accordingly the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
