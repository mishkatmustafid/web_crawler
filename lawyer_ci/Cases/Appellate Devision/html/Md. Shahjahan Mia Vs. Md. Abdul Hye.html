The appellant S.C. Suit No. 3 of 1997 in the Court of Assistant Judge, 2nd Court, Dhaka for eviction of the respondent from the suit shop stating that it was initially let out on 19.5.1981 to the respondent as a monthly tenant at a rental of Tk. 400/- and the lease was, however, renewed by a fresh agreement dated 13.4.1988 fixing the monthly rental at Tk. 700/-. The respondent for the month of December 1990 and for January 1991 to March 1991 paid rents on 24.3.1991 and rent for the month of January 1996 was paid on 24.3.1996 and thus the respondent was a defaulter. It was further sated that the appellant required the suit shop for the purpose of business of his eldest son who was unemployed. The petitioner in order to deter­mine the tenancy and for vacating the shop room served notice under section 106 of the Transfer of property Act.<br/><br/>3. Respondent contested the suit by filing written statement stating that the appellant on receipt of Tk. 3,00,000/- as value for possession the two shop rooms leased out by the agreement fixing the monthly rental at Tk. 700/-. It was further stated by him that when for the month of December 1990 and for month of January 1991 to March, 1991 he went to pay the rent, the appellant refused to accept the rents which was deposited by him on 24.3.1991. The respondent also denied that the appellant required the suit shops bonafide and also service of notice under section 106 of Transfer of property Act.<br/><br/>4. The learned S.S.C. Judge, on contest, decreed the suit on consideration of Ext. G-9, Challan, showing payment of rent by the respondent on the findings that the respondent defaulted in payment of rent and that the appel­lant required the suit shops bonafied.<br/><br/>5. The respondent against the judgment and decree of the learned S.C.C. Judge moved the High Court Division in revision by an applica­tion under Section 25 of the Small Causes Courts Act and obtained a Rule. The learned Single Judge of the High Court Division by a judgment dated 3.11.1998 made the Rule absolute, on contest, sending the suit on remand for fresh trial.<br/><br/>6. Leave was granted to consider whether the High Court Division was wrong in remand­ing the suit with the observation that more evi­dence is required to prove default in payment of rents by the respondent although the suit was filed both on the grounds of bonafide require­ment and default and decree was made on both the courts, and whether the High Court Division fell in error to rebind the suit on the face of admission by the respondent that he deposited rents  for the months in question    on 24.3.1991 and whether the High Court Division acted illegally in raising the question regarding genuineness of the Challan showing payment of rents although no issue was raised on this point before the S.C.C. Judge.<br/><br/>7. Mr. Md. Fazlul Karim, learned Advocate for the Appellant submits that the order of remand by the High Court Division has occa­sioned failure of justice as a long drawn process would be necessary to get the final decree to the prejudice of the appellant-landlord. He further submits that the respondent-tenants having had admitted deposit of rents for the month of November, 1990 and for the months of January, 1991 to March, 1991 on 24.3.1991 and which having been brought to the notice of the court below the learned Single Judge fell in error in sending the suit on remand for the issue on default only for payment of rent for the month of January 1996 without holding that already there was default for payment of rent for the months of December 1990 and January 1991 to March, 1991. He further submits that the dispute regarding genuineness of Challan Ext. G-9 having not been raised in any form before S.C.C. Judge, the learned Judge of the High Court Division was wrong to direct remand of the suit on the grounds of default without reversing the finding of bonafide requirement made by the learned S.C.C. Judge.<br/><br/>8. Mr. Mahmudul Islam, the learned Advocate for the respondent, on the other hand, submitted that on refusal by the appellant to accept the rent sent through money order for the months of December 1990 and January 1991 on 13.1.1991 the respondents were not defaulters because of regular deposit of rents of rents in the Court of Rent Controller with his permis­sion. He further submits that the learned Single Judge did not commit any wrong to send the suit on remand for determining default on fresh evidence and that without framing any issue in respect of bonafide requirement the learned S.C.C Judge wrongly found that the shop rooms required for bonafide purpose by the appellant although the appellant had other shop rooms in the suit holding which he let out after institution of the suit. Mr. Mahmudul Islam further sub­mits that the respondent being a bonafide pur­chaser of possession of the shop rooms the landlord is estopped from taking khas posses­sion of the same and the learned S.C.C. Judge erred in not considering this aspect.<br/><br/>9. The finding of a bonafide requirement is essentially a finding of fact to be arrived at on consideration of evidence on record. The expression "bonafide requirement" also includes requirement by a member of the fami­ly of the landlord. In the instant case the appel­lant wanted the shop rooms for the purpose of doing business through his son who was at the relevant time a member of his family. Merely because a tenant owns shop rooms other than those let out a suit for eviction cannot be defected on that ground alone. The choice of a partic­ular shop room or premises where a landlord has more than one premises is not with the ten­ant but with the landlord; In the event choice is left with the tenant it will lead to an absurd sit­uation and the landlord shall be at the mercy of the tenants. Such intention cannot be read into the provision of the premises Rent Control Ordinance. The submission on estoppels cannot be accepted for the simple reason that neither from the affidavit-in-opposition of the respon­dent filed in the High Court Division nor from its judgment such plea is fund to have been raised and decided. At this appellate stage we cannot allow such plea. Purchase of possession of a shop room cannot be equated with purchase of shop room to deprive a landlord of claiming title to the property which he has let out to a ten­ant. Nor it can’t be said that a landlord’s, suit for eviction of a tenant fails for taking money from a tenant against possession of premises let out to him. Such situations cannot be accepted. Therefore, the landlord is not estopped by prin­ciple of promissory estoppels from evicting a tenant from a premises let out to him on the ground that the landlord has taken money for delivering possession of the shop rooms in question. In the instant case as the suit was decreed on the finding of default and bonafide requirement the High Court Division was wrong in sending the suit on remand for dispos­al on fresh evidence to decide the issue on default. The High Court Division ought to have decreed the suit alone on the ground of <em>bonafide</em> requirement as found by the learned S.C.C Judge and without reversing such finding of fact arrived on due consideration of evidence on record by the learned S.C.C. Judge the High Court Division fell in error in sending the suit an remand.<br/><br/>10. For the aforesaid reasons, we are of the opinion that the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division was wrong in passing the impugned judgment and order. Accordingly, we set aside the same and restore that of the learned S.S.C. Judge decreeing the suit.<br/>In the result, the appeal is allowed with­out any order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
