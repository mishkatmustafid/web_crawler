The suit was, on trans­fer, renumbered as S.C.C. Suit No. 02 of 2002. In that suit the petitioner filed an application for accepting his written state­ment in substitution of the previous state­ment which was said to have been filed by the plaintiffs by using their names. The learned Senior Assistant Judge, rejected the said prayer. The petitioner thereafter unsuccessfully moved the learned District Judge, in revision and thereafter moved the High Court Division without success.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> As against the judgment and order of the High Court Division the petitioners have filed this petition for leave to appeal.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> Heard the learned Advocate-on-Record and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> It appears that in a suit instituted in 1996 a similar prayer for substitution of the written statement was filed and reject­ed by the trial court on 3rd October, 2002 which was affirmed by the High Court Division. Again a similar prayer was repeated and has been rejected up to the High Court Division with good reasons.<br/> <br/>We find no substance in this petition which is accordingly dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
