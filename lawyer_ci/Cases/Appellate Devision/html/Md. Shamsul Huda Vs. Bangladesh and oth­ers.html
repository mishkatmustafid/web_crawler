M. Mahmudur Rahman J. - </strong>This appeal by leave at the instance of defendant No. 1 - appellant is against the judgment and order dated 16.7.91 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in First Appeal No. 22 of 1981 allowing the appeal on setting aside the judgment and decree passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, First Court Mymensingh in O.C. Suit No. 102 of 1973.<br/><br/>2. The plaintiff- the People's Republic of Bangladesh - respondent instituted O.C. Suit No. 102 of 1973 against defendant No. 1, Md. Shamsul Huda and defendant No. 2 Benode Lai Roy for declaration that the <em>ex parte</em> decree passed in O.C. Suit No. 35 of 1969 for specific performance of contract and the deed of trans­fer obtained on the basis of the said decree are illegal null and void on the averments, <em>inter alia</em> , that the suit property belonged to one Lala Ram Sankar who died unmarried and sarna Kumari was a maid servant of Lala Ram. After the death of Lala Ram she used to look after his properties through her servant defendant No. 2 Ronade Lai Roy. On her death defendant No.2 in collusion with defendant No. 1 created a fraudulent and ante-dated bainapatra purported to have been executed by Sarna Kumari on 17.12.63 and after the death of Sarna Kumari defendant No. 1 filed O.C. suit No.35 of 1969 for specific performance of contract for the suit property snowing defendant No.2 as heir of Sarna Kumari and on the basis of the said bainapatra got an <em>ex parte</em> decree. The plaintiff was in possession of the suit properties through tenants and title of the plaintiff - Government to the property in Suit was clouded by the said decree and the sale deed. Hence the suit.<br/><br/>3. Defendant No. 1 contested the suit. His case was that the suit properties are self-acquired properties of Sarna Kumari Roy and she was in possession therein for more than 12 years. She entered into a contract on 17.12.63 for sale of the property in suit for Tk. 39,000/- with defendant No. 1 and on receipt Tk. 38,100/- She delivered possession of a portion of the property to him. It was stipulated in the bainapatra that Sarna Kumari would take clear­ance from Income Tax Authority for transfer­ring the property. In the meantime she died leaving behind defendant No. 2, her mother's sister's son as a sole heir. On refusal of defen­dant No.2 the aforesaid O.C suit No. 35 of 1969 was instituted impleading defendant No. 2 and the plaintiff obtained an <em>ex parte</em> decree which was sought to be set aside by the Government-respondent by filing O.C. Suit No. 102 of 1973. After obtaining the <em>ex parte </em>decree the plaintiff of O.C. Suit No. 35 of 1969 started other Execution Case No.22 of 1969 and obtained a kabala executed Through Court on 31.7.72 and also got his name mutated in the record of right and on payment of rent got dakilas and also realised rents from the tenants of the suit prop­erty.<br/><br/>4. Defendant Nos. 3 and 4 tenants of the suit property also filed a separate written state­ment stating that Lala Ram was the owner in possession of the property in suit and he mar­ried Sarna Kumari. Lala Ram permitted Sarna Kumari to adopt a son and Gour Sankar was the adopted son under a deed of adoption. Ext. A (1) executed on 29.7.46. Thus, Gour sankar became sole owner of the suit property. Gour Sankar migrated to India. But Sarna Kumari was living in Mymensingh and maintained her­self out of the income of the suit properties. Further case of the defendants was that the suit property vested in the Custodian as enemy property and 7 or abandoned property and Sarna Kumari had no authority to enter into a Contract for sale of the suit property with defendant No. 1 and the bainapatra was a fraud­ulent document and the decree passed in O. C. Suit No. 35 of 1969 for specific performance of contract was a forged and fraudulent one. Their further case was that they were in possession in a part of the property in suit for more than 12 years and acquired title by adverse possession.<br/><br/>5. The trial Court by its judgment and decree dated 31.3.1980 dismissed the suit with the findings that the suit property was the exclu­sive property of Sarna Kumari, that she entered into agreement for sale of the property  with defendant No. 1 and that defendant No.2 was the son of Sarna Kumari's mother's sister and he was her heir and that she did not adopt Gour Sankar and that the impugned decree passed in O.C. Suit No. 35 of 1969 was legal and defen­dant No. 1 acquired legal title to the property in suit and that he was in possession.<br/><br/>6. Against the judgment and decree of the trial Court the plaintiff-government preferred F.A. no 22 of 1991. Defendant No. 1 - appellant con­tested the appeal in the High Court Division.<br/><br/>7. The learned Judges of the High Court Division allowed the appeal and reversed the judgment and decree passed by the trial court on the findings that the suit property belonged to Gour Sankar Roy, the adopted son of Sarna Kumari and Sarna Kumari had no title to and possession in the suit property and that defen­dant No. 2 had no ownership in the property in suit and no right to transfer the same to defen­dant No. 1 the learned Judges also found that Gour Sankar migrated to India and became cit­izen of India and that the property vested in the custodian and that without impleading Gour Sankar Roy or the custodian of the enemy prop­erty in the suit the suit was bad for defect of par­ties and that the ex-parte decree and the kabala are null and void. The learned Judges revived O.C. Suit No. 35 of 1969 with the direction to implead Lala Gour Sankar Roy or his heirs, if he is not alive and the Government of Bangladesh as defendants.<br/><br/>8. Mr. S. R. Pal, learned Advocate for the appellant contends that none of the courts below having found that the property left by Lala Ram Sankar Roy escheated to the Government and the Government not being a party to O.C. Suit No. 35 of 1969 the learned Judges of the High Court Division fell into an error of law in not holding that the property in suit belonged to Sarna Kumari who executed the agreement for sale with defendant No. 1 and in that view of the legal position the learned Judges of the High Court Division seriously fell in an error of law in allowing the appeal and reviving O.C. Suit No. 35 of 1969 setting aside <em>ex parte</em> decree and declaring the kabala exe­cuted on the basis of the said <em>ex parte</em> decree void. He also submits that the learned Judges of the High Court Division were also wrong in directing defendant No. 1 to implead Lala Gour Sankar Roy or his heirs, as the case may be and the plaintiff-Government as defendants in that suit upon an erroneous view that the property in suit was a vested property which was not the case of the plaintiff-Government in O.C. Suit No. 102 of 1973 and the learned Judges of the High Court Division made out a third case upon an erroneous view that the property in suit is a vested one.<br/><br/>9. On reference to the averments made in the plaint in O.C. Suit No. 102 of 1973 we are unable to find that the plaintiff- respondent have stated that the property in suit is a vested one. From the averments made in this plaint we also find that defendant No.2 in collusion with defendant No.1 entered into a bainapatra on 17.12.63 showing defendant No. 2 an heir of Sarna Kumari and obtained a decree in O.C. Suit No. 35 of 1969 and pursuant to which defendant No.1 got the kabala executed and registered through the Court. The learned sub­ordinate Judge also found that Lala Ram Sankar and Gour Sankar had no right, title, interest and possession in the suit property and Sarna Kumari had absolute right, title interest and possession in the suit property and she entered into an agreement with defendant No. 1 for sale of the suit property on 17.12.1963 and delivered possession of the suit property to defendant No. 1 but before execution and registration of the kabala she died childless leaving Benode Lai Roy, her mother's sister's son, as her only heir. Neither from the averments made in the plaint we find that the plaintiff claimed the property in suit as a vested property nor we find that the learned Subordinate Judge held that the property is a vested property. But inspite of such averments made in the plaint and the find­ing of the learned Subordinate Judge the learned Judges of the High Court Division have made out a third case in holding that the prop­erty is a vested property. Mr. Pal rightly con­tended that the learned Judges of the High Court Division made out a third case in holding that the property in suit is a vested property. For the above reasons we are of the opinion that the learned Judges of the High Court Division wrongly held that the suit property is a vested property.<br/><br/>10. Being confronted with these con­tentions Mr. Fazlul Karim the learned Advocate for respondent Nos. 3(1) and 4(2) felt difficulty to repel the contentions of Mr. Pal. Mr. Shahidul Islam Chowdhury, learned Advocate for respondent No. 1, also felt similar difficulty.<br/><br/>11. Accordingly, we allow the appeal and set aside the impugned Judgment and decree dated 16,7.91 of the High Court Division with­out any order as to costs and restore those of the trial court.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
