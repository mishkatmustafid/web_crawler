The facts of the case, in short, are that the plaintiffs filed Title Suit No. 97 of 1985 in the Court of Assistant Judge, Mulladi, Barisal for partition of the land as described in the schedule-'Ka' to the plaint alleging, <em>inter alia,</em> that the suit land appertaining to Petty Settlement Khatian No. 70 covering and area of 9.02 acres originally belonged to three brothers namely Hamid Ali, Wahed Ali and Sabder Ali. The plaintiffs are the heirs of Hamid Ali and Wahed Ali. On the other hand, the defendants are the heirs of Sabder Ali. At the time of prepa­ration of R.S. subsequent to S.A. Khatian, more share then that of the defendants were entitled, was recorded in the name of the defendants. The plaintiffs were entitled to get 2/3rd share covering and area of 6.02 acres as heirs of Hamid Ali and Wahed Ali. On the other hand, the defendants were entitled to get <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>rd share covering an area of 3.01 acres as left by their predecessor-in-interest, Sabder Ali. As the suit land was not earlier partitioned by metes and bounds so the plaintiffs requested the defendants to make partition of the suit land amicably but they did not pay heed, hence the plaintiffs instituted the instant for partition.<br/><br/>3. The defendant No.1 contested the suit by filing written statement denying the entire material allegation contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit was not maintainable, it was barred by limitation and also barred waiver, estoppel and acquiescence. His specific case, in short, was i that the suit land appertaining to Petty Settlement Khatian No. 70 covering an area of 9.02 belonged to Hamid Ali, Wahed Ali and Sabder Ali in equal share. Hamid Ali, Wahed Ali and Sabder Ali sold 1/3rd share covering an area of 2.226  acres  of land from  the Petty Settlement Khatian No.70 to Rupjan Bibi, wife of Sabder Ali and mother of  the  defendants. Accordingly, Rupjan Bibi's name was recorded correctly in both R.S. and S.A. Khatians. The defendants have been possessing the said land. He prayed for dismissal of the suit.<br/><br/>4. Mr. Bivash Chandra Biswas learned Advocate-on-Record, appearing for the petitioner submitted that Rupjan Bibi, the predecessor-in-interest of the defendants, purchased 2.226 acres of land from the admitted owner and on the basis of that purchase R.S. and S.A. record of rights was prepared in her name and she took over possession to the said land and thereafter her successor-in-interest, the defendants, have been possessing the said land. In view of such categorical assertions and evidence as adduced by them onus squarely lies upon the plaintiffs to prove that the R.S. and S.A. record of rights were prepared erroneously in the name of Rupjan Bibi in order to rebut the title particularly to rebut the presumption attached thereto rights Rupjan Bibi but the plaintiffs hopelessly failed to prove so. The learned Advocate further submitted that the last Court of fact on consideration of the evidence of record particularly, the R.S. and S.A. record of rights and title came to the conclusion that Rupjan Bibi acquired title in 2.226 acres or land, thereby modified the judgment and decree of the trial Court.<br/><br/>5. On considering the evidence of record the High Court Division found that the findings of the Court below were based on non-consideration of the evidence of record inasmuch as the presumption of R.S. record of rights  has  not been rebutted resulting in as error of law in the decision occasioning failure of jus­tice.<br/><br/>6. In view of the above, we find no sub­stance in the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner.<br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
