The respondents as plaintiffs instituted a S.C.C. Suit No.13 of 1994 before the 2nd Court of Assistant Judge, Dhaka which was subsequently transferred to the 3rd Court of Senior Assistant Judge and renumbered as S.C.C. Suit No.4 of 2002; that in the said S.C.C. suit the petitioners were impleaded as defendants with a prayer for their eviction from the suit premise alleging, <em>inter alia</em>, that the defen­dants were inducted as tenants in the suit premise by the plaintiffs on the basis of a deed of agreement dated 26.10.1988 and that the defendants paid rents up to the months of August, 1993 and thereafter they did not pay the rent to the plaintiffs and became defaulters; that the plaintiffs issued a notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act upon the defen­dants on 11.07.1994 asking them to vacate the suit premise on 31.07.1994 and that the defendants after receiving the notice gave a reply dated 26.07.1994 denying the plaintiffs claim and hence the suit.<br/><br/>3. The present petitioners as defendants contested the suit by filing written state­ment denying the plaintiffs' case stating <em>inter alia</em>, that the plaintiffs though received the rents from the defendants in time but were in the habit of not issuing rent receipt and the plaintiffs took some money as loan from defendant No.2 and the defendant No. 2 used to write it in a account book and in terms of the account book the plaintiffs took a total amount of Tk. 8,462.00 between 13.04.1989 to 29.12.1991 and after adjustment of Tk.700.00 against rent for January,1992 the plaintiffs issued a receipt and the balance amount realizable form the plaintiffs stood at Tk. 7762.00and the plaintiffs adjusted Tk.200.00 against the rent for the month of February, 1992 and the balance amount realizable from the plaintiff till 13.06.1994 stood at Tk. 32,448.00 and in such situation the defendants took rent of one room from plaintiff No.3 on 15.06.1994 on payment of security for Tk. 20,000.00that the rest amount for Tk. 12,464.00 was adjusted against rent for 2 months and rent receipt was paid to the defendants on 22.06.1994; that defendant paid rents for the months from September, 1993 to January, 1995 but did not give any receipt for the said amount and the Bazar Committee could not settle the dispute between the parties and in view of the decision of the Bazar Committee the defendants remitted rent for the month of February, 1995 on 04.02.1995 by money order which was not received by the plain­tiffs and the money order was returned to the defendants on 15.02.1995 and that the defendants deposited the rent to the con­cerned rent controller on 19.02.1995 in rent deposit Case No.6 of 1995 and paid rent regularly in the said rent deposit case and prayed for dismissal of the suit.<br/><br/>4. Mr. T.H. Khan, learned Counsel, appearing for the petitioner submits that on 26.10.1988 the parties entered into an agreement exhibited as exhibit-1 contain­ing clause No. 1 wherein it was clearly stated that the plaintiffs transferred the possessory rights of the suit premise to the defendants petitioners for an amount of Tk. 3,00,000.00 (three lacs) and thereby the petitioners are not ejectable tenant on the  suit premise but the  High  Court Division without considering the  same illegally discharged the Rule and as such the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division cannot be sustained in law.<br/><br/>5. The learned Counsel further submits that the defendants are not monthly ejectable tenant; that the defendants pur­chased possessory right of the suit premise on 26.10.1988 at the cost of Tk. 3,00,000.00 and to that effect on the same date the agreement was entered into between the parties but the High Court Division without considering the above most illegally discharged the Rule with modification directing the plaintiffs to deposit Tk. 3,00,000.00.<br/><br/>6.The learned Counsel further submits that the plaintiffs took loan from the defendant No.2 on different dates balance of which lastly stood at Tk. 12,050.00 as on 07.07.1994 which was adjusted from rent of September, 1993 to January, 1995 for about 17 months amounting to Tk. 11,900.00 and that after said adjustment there was a balance of Tk. 150.00 due from the plaintiffs but the plaintiffs did not give any receipts about the said amount and that the Salish was held before the Ward Commissioner and decision was held on 18.09.1994 which was exhibit-'e'; that   as per decision of the Ward Commissioner the plaintiffs did not give receipts to the defendants and that as per decision of the Ward Commissioner the petitioners sent the rent for the month of February, 1995, on 04.02.1995 by money order which was not received by the plain­tiffs and the money order was returned to the petitioners on 15.02.1995 and that the petitioners deposited the rent to the rent controller on 19.02.1995 in rent deposit Case No. 6 of 1995 and that till today peti­tioners are regularly depositing the rent in the said rent deposit case but the trial Court without considering the exhibit and oral evidence illegally decreed the suit by misreading and non-consideration of the oral and documentary evidence on record and that the High Court Division, without considering the same passed-the impugned judgment and order which can not be sus­tained in law;<br/><br/>7.  Lastly, the leaned Counsel submits that the  agreements  dated 26.10.1988  was made between the parties for 5 years and it was agreed that after 5 years the rent would be enhanced after mutual discus­sion; that after the expiry of 5 years the plaintiffs- respondents sent a letter to the defendants- petitioners to fix the rent for the further period as per terms of previous agreement; that the said letter was exhibit­ed as exhibit-'Ga' before the trial Court without objection; that if the petitioners were really defaulters the question of fur­ther enhancement of rent could not arise but the Courts below ignoring the exhibit-'Ga' most illegally decreed the suit and discharged the Rule by illegally holding that the petitioners were defaulters.<br/><br/>8.  We have head Mr. Md. Ozair Farooq, leaned Counsel, appearing for respondent who supported the impugned judgment with reference to the evidence on record both oral and documentary.<br/><br/>9.  On consideration of the submissions of the parties and perusal of the materials on record and the obtaining circumstances, we are unable to persuade ourselves to agree with the submissions of the learned Counsel for the petitioners. The materials on record clearly show that the petitioners are defaulters and accordingly liable to be evicted.<br/><br/>In that view of the matter, we find no substance in the submissions of the learned Counsel for the petitioners in the facts and circumstances of the case.<br/>Accordingly, the application is dis­missed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
