The facts, in short, are that Badia Sheikh is the original owner of the schedule land measuring 2.27 decimals under C.S Khatian No. 354 correspon­ding to hal khatian No.479 and J.L. No. 225 and of survey settlement was prepared and finally published in his name and accordingly he was enjoying the schedule land peacefully without May hindrance from any quarter, that C.S. tenant Badia Sheikh died leaving behind one son, Bhula Sheikh, one wife, Nasiran and two daughters namely, Paglimai and Rahiman Nessa and there­after wife of Badia Sheikh died leaving behind her aforesaid son and daughters, who are the absolute sharers of the schedule property.<br/><br/>3.  Bhula Sheikh, son of Badia Sheikh sold out 90 decimals of land from C.S. Plot No. 1609, 1611 and 1624 of the schedule to the plaintiff and his sister-in-law Rahiman Nessa on 21.12.1953 being sale deed No. 23725 and delivered vacant possession to them on the same date and accordingly the father of the plaintiffs Dr. Moslemuddin acquired right, title and interest to the said 45 decimals of land from the aforesaid plot. Subsequently Bhula Sheikh sold out 29 decimals of land from C.S. Plot No. 1149 of the schedule to the aforesaid pur­chasers on 25.11.1954 by sale deed being 15314 and taking over delivery of possession of the aforesaid land they were enjoying the same jointly.<br/><br/>4. Thereafter Rahiman Nessa died leav­ing behind husband Asimuddin, two sons namely, Md. Tasimuddin and Md. Aziz and one daughter Most. Nurjahan Bibi. Md. Tazimuddin sold out 29 deci­mals of land from plot No. 1609 to Dr. Moslemuddin, predecessor of plaintiffs on 12.01.1968 by sale deed being No.1178 and delivered vacant posses­sion to him on the same day. It is stated that out of aforesaid 29 decimals land 23 ½ decimals of land stands as per saham of Bhula Sheikh.  From the above it appears that from Bhula Sheikh, son of C.S. tenant Dr. Moslehuddin and Rahiman Nessa jointly purchased in all 113½ decimals from plot No.1609, 1611, 1624 and 1149 by registered sale deeds being Nos. 23726 dated 23.12.1953 and 15314 dated 25.11.1954 out of which Dr. Moslemuddin is entitled half of 113 ½  decimals from only son of Rahiman Nessa from C.S. plot No. 1609 by regis­tered    sale  deed No. 1178 dated 12.11.1968 and accordingly he acquired right, title and interest of 80 1A decimals in all our of which 31 decimals of land were sold out and as such Dr. Moslemuddin predecessor of the plain­tiffs prayed for partition of his remain­ing portion, he was dispossessed from 11 decimals of land by defendant Nos. 16-20 who constructed pucca struc­ture thereon and as such he also prayed for recovery of khas possession.<br/><br/>5. The defendant Nos. 16-18 contested the suit by filing written statement to the effect that the suit is not maintainable in this form and defect of parties and barred by limitation and also stated that Bhula Sheikh was the original C.S. ten­ant who died leaving one wife, one son and two daughters and as such his son, Bhula Sheikh 1.13½ daughters 55 1A decimals of land got as sharer and accordingly record was prepared and published in their names and in the meantime Rahiman Nessa died leaving her husband (defendant No. 1) two sons (defendant Nos.2-3) and one daughter (defendant No. 4) and they amicable made partition among them. Defendant Nos.1-3 got half of the land from C.S. plot No. 1609. Asimuddin and defendant No.3 sold out 0.06 acre and 0.00 acre from plot Nb.1609 of disputed jote to the defendant Nos.16-18 on 10.12.1983 and 22.06.1982 by registered sale deed and subsequently the defendant Nos.16-18 purchased 0.03 acre of land from plaintiffs from plot No.609 which was purchased by the plaintiff from Bhula Sheikh and accordingly the defendants acquired right, title and interest to 0.10 acre of land from disputed plot No. 1609 and defendants have been enjoying the property for about 9 years. The plaintiffs sold out the land to the different persons including the defendants and as such the plaintiffs have no land of 58 ½ decimals in the suit plot. The other purchasers would be the necessary parties in the suit.<br/><br/>6. Defendant Nos. 19 and 20 contested the suit by filing written statement wherein they stated that plaintiff did not purchase 0.33 acre of land from Tajim Uddin or he did not take possession of the same and if so the deed will be the forged and without consideration and accordingly the plaintiff did not get the saham of 0.33 decimals of land. The plaintiff sold out the land to the different person and as such 0½ decimal of land of the disputed jote may be remained with him. On the other hand defendant No.29 contested the suit by filing writ­ten statements wherein he stated that from disputed jote Ehula Sheikh 1.13½ acre and Rahiman Nessa including Paglaimai each of the .56½ decimal of land got as saham and they enjoyed the same jointly and accordingly C.S. and S.A. records were rightly prepared as their saham. Rahiman Nessa sold out some portion of land and after death of Rahiman Nessa her husband Azimuddin got one anna, two sons, defendant Nos. 2-3 namely, Abdul Aziz and Tajimuddin each of them got /22/5 pai and one daughter, defendant No.4 Nurjahan got /21/5 pai as their saham. They possessed land of disputed jote and on amicable partition defendant, Abdul Aziz sold out 0.3 ½ acre from plot No. 1609 and ½ acre from plot No. 1612 to the defendant by registered sale deed being No.1791 dated 17.01.1983 and the defendant took pos­session and is enjoying the same. Lastly the defendant Nos.1-3 contested the suit by filing the written statement wherein it is stated that defendant Nos.1-3 were the heirs of Rahiman Nessa, out of them defendant No. 2 sold out his share of 0.24 decimals of land from plot Nos.1609, 1611and 1624 to one Zahura on 06.08.1978 who sold out the same to Sarwar Hussain, son of defendant No. 2 on 19.10.1978. Paglimai Bibi, mother of defendant No.5 transfers .23½ acre of land from disputed plot No.1149 and 1609 to Musammat Sarwan Nessa, wife of defendant No. 2 on 26.01.1981 by <em>heba bil ewaj</em> deed No.2356 and surren­dered the possession of the land. The defendant No. 2 had no right to sale the land and he did not sale 0.33 acre of land to the plaintiff by kabala No.1178 dated 12.01.1968 and if so, he created the said deed by applying fraud, beyond the knowledge of defendant No. 2.<br/><br/>7. The trial court dismissed the suit on appeal the judgment of the trial court was set aside and the suit was sent back  on remand to amend the plaint with prayer for recovery of khas possession in respect of 11 decimals of land from which the plaintiff was dispossessed and thereafter the plaintiff amended the plaint and ultimately after hearing the trial court decreed the suit and the defendant preferred appeal before the learned District Judge and again the appellate court allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment and decree of the trial court.<br/><br/>8. The plaintiff then preferred Civil Revision No. 1360 of 2001 before the High Court Division and the High Court Division after hearing parties made the Rule absolute and set aside the judgment of the appellate court.<br/><br/>9. As against the judgment of the High Court Division the defendant petitioners have filed this petitioner for leave to appeal.<br/><br/>10. Heard the learned Advocate and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/><br/>11. It appears that the High Court Division found that the appellate court did not consider the evidence on record while setting aside the judgment of the trial court and further held that the plain­tiffs kabala was earlier on the basis of which they took possession from the admitted co sharer and the defendants are subsequent purchaser from the plaintiff as well as the co- sharers and they cannot deny the title and possession of the plaintiff.<br/>We do not find any substance in this petition which is accordingly dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
