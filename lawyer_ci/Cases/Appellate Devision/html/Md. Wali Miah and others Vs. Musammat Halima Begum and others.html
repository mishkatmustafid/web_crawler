Short facts are that the plaintiffs proposed to mortgage 10 gondas of land of  Plot No. 53 of C.S. Khatian No. 75 of Mouza Korabari within P.S.Kosba, District-Brahmanbaria and the defendant No. 2 agreed to take the land in mortgage for his daughter, defendant No. 1 at a consideration of Tk. 5,000/-. It was agreed that the defendant No.1 would reconvey the land on payment of consideration money. Accordingly plaintiff was taken to Sub-Registrar's Office by the defendant No.3, brother of the defendant No.1. The defendant No. 3 purchased the stamp paper and got the deed scribed by a deed writer of his choice in the absence of the plaintiff. Thereafter, the defendant No.3 hurriedly approached the plaintiff to execute the deed as the Sub-Registrar Office was going to be closed for the day. The plaintiff on bonafide belief and trust executed and registered the deed on the same date. The further case of the plaintiff was that he never sold the suit land to the defendant No.1. The plaintiff remained in possession of the suit land as before.<br/><br/>3. The defendant No.1 contested the suit by filing written statement and contended, inter alia, that the plaintiff proposed to sell the suit land along with the shop hut standing on the suit land to the defendant No.1 who agreed to purchase the same at a consideration of Tk.5,000/- and on payment of the consideration money the plaintiff executed and registered the deed in question in favour of the defendant No.1. The further case is that it was settled between the parties that Wali Mia, son of the plaintiff would become a monthly tenant in the shop on the suit land under the defendant No.1 at a monthly rental of Tk.150/- and then handed over the possession to the defendant No.1.<br/><br/>4. We have heard Mr. Md. Amir Hossain, the learned Advocate-on-Record for the petitioner and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected paper.<br/><br/>5. It appears that the appellate court below disbelieved the evidence of P.W.2 Nannu   Mia as there were inherent contradictions in his evidence and no other witness was examined by the plaintiff in support of his case regarding talk and execution and registration of mortgage deed as claimed by him. The High Court Division on correct assessment and consideration of the material evidence on record rightly upheld the findings of the appellate court on this point. The learned Advocate-on-Record for the petitioner argued that .0<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> decimal of land of Brahmanbaria was included in the document to attract the jurisdiction of the Sub-Registrar's Office at Brahmanbaria for the purpose of registration of the document and this land is fictitious land and on this count also the document in question is liable to be declared void. It appears that in this connection the High Court Division considered the provisions of section 28(2) of Registration Act and came to the conclusion that the document in question is not affected by such inclusion of .0<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> decimal of land of Brahmanbaria.<br/><br/>6. It appears that the High Court Division on correct assessment and appreciation of the evidence and materials on record arrived at a correct finding that the plaintiff has not been able to prove his case and as such we find no reason to interfere with the same.<br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
