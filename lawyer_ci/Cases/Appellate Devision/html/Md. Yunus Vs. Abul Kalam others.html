Abdul Aziz J.- </strong>This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 10.12.2007 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division No. 42 of 2004 making the Rule absolute arising out of judgment and order dated 21.07.2003 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 1st Court, Chittagong, in Miscellaneous Appeal No.145 of 1998 allowing the appeal after setting aside the judgment and order dated 29.09.1998 passed by the Assistant Judge, Hathazari, Chittagong in Title Suit No.45 of 1996 granting an order of mandatory injunction.<br/><br/>2. Facts, in brief, are that one Abdur Rahman, father of respondent No.1-4 as plaintiffs instituted Title suit no. 45 of 1996 in the Court of Assistant Judge, hathazari, Chittagong for confirmation of possession and partition in respect of the suit land for 6 gondas, 2 karas, 1 kranti and share in 12 decimals of land out of 73 decimals appertaining to C. S. Plot No.1063 and 1068 under R. S. Khatian No. 878 corresponding to R. S. Plot No.722 measuring .55 decimals and R. S. Plot No.726 measuring  18  decimals as described in the schedule of the plaint. Thereafter, on 10.06.1996 the plain­tiffs also filed an application under Order 39, Rule and 2 read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure praying   for temporary injunction restraining the defendant No.1 and 6 from disturbing the peaceful possession of the homestead and from demolishing their latrine of breaking the fencing or cutting the trees in the suit property behind the western side of their house till disposal of the suit.    <br/><br/>3. The petitioner as defendant No.1 filed written objections against the petition for   temporary injunction denying the allegation, contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the plaintiff has got no <em>prima facie</em> and good arguable case as such he is not entitled to get any order of injunction. The suit plot is vague and not identifiable and that the balance of conveniences and inconvenience is in favour of the defendants since the defendant is in exclusive pos session of the suit land long before filing the suit as such this petition for injunction is not maintainable, etc.<br/><br/>4. The trial Court upon hearing the parties directed them for maintainable <em>status quo</em> by it's order dated 21.01.1997. On 19.02.1997 the plaintiff filed another application for granting mandatory injunction against the defendant No.1 and 6 for removing  bamboo fence closing the door of kitchen room and a room constructed in the vacant land of the back side and  unlocking the door of latrine etc. Two local inspections were held. The trial Court by the judgment and order dated 29.09.1998 allowed the prayer of mandatory injunction relying on the Advocate Commissioner's report. Being aggrieved thereby, defendant No.1 and 6 filed Miscellaneous Appeal before the District Judge, Chittagong, which was transferred to the Court of the Joint District Judge, First Court, Chittagong for disposal, who allowed the appeal by the judgment and order dated 21.07.2003 reversing the judgment and order of the trial Court.<br/><br/>5. Against the aforesaid judgment and order of reversal dated 21.07.2003, the plaintiff as petitioner preferred Civil Revision No.42 of 2004 before the High Court Division and the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division issued Rule and upon hearing both sides the Rule was made absolute. Hence this leave petition.<br/><br/>6. Mr. Md. Abdus Salam Khan, the learned Senior Advocate appearing for the petitioner, submits that the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division without arriving at any find­ing whether the plaintiffs has got any <em>prima facie</em> and a good arguable case and the balance of convenience and inconvenience  and  without  setting aside the judgment of the Court of appeal below granted an order of mandatory injunction as such its decision merit interference by this Court, He also submits that the trial Court by it's judgment and order dated 21.01.1997 found that in whose possession the suit plot is not ascertainable as such he directed the plaintiffs and the defendant to maintain <em>status quo</em> fixing 13.02.1997 for hearing of the written objection of on the report of local inspection of the Advocate  Commissioner but the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division without considering the identity of the suit land maintained the order of  mandatory injunction of the trial court  and as such its decision merit interference by the Court, etc.<br/><br/>7. We have heard the learned Advocate for the petitioner and perused the impugned judgment and order and those of the lower Courts available with the leave petition.    <br/><br/>8. On an application under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 filed by the plaintiff, trial Court passed an order directing the parties to maintain <em>status quo </em>in respect of possession and position of the suit property.  Thereafter on an application filed by the plaintiffs praying for an order of mandatory injunction on the allegation stated therein, trial Court allowed the same against the defendant-petitioner. Court of appeal below affirmed the same on the appeal filed by the petitioner and the High Court Division also affirmed the same.  <br/><br/>9. A learned Single Judge of the High Court Division in her well considered view found that the petitioner caused some mischief in the suit property causing serious prejudice to the plaintiff violating the order of <em>status quo </em>granted initially by the trial Court and as such trial court rightly granted mandatory injunction on the prayer of the plaintiff which has also been affirmed by the Court of appeal below.<br/><br/>10. In consideration of the above, we, therefore, find no substance in the sub-missions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner and find no merit in the leave petition. The leave petition is thus dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
