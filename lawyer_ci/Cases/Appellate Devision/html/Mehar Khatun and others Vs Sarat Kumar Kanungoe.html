Defendant is the appellant. Plaintiff respondent filed the suit being O. Suit No. 93 of 1964 in the Court of Munsif, Chittagong for ejectment of the defendant M. A. Sattar (predecessor of the appellant). His case was that the defendant was a friend of his and on his request the plaintiff gave the defen­dant and his family temporary accommodation in his premises in 1956 on clear understan­ding that they would vacate the same on securing alternative accommodation. The defendant was making delay in finding altern­ative accommodation and when the plaintiff told him to vacate the defendant gave out that he has already purchased a plot of land and would leave that the suit premises after construction of his house; even after const­ruction of the house the defendant let it out to other which made the plaintiff suspici­ous. So he pressed the defendant to vacate when the defendant said that he would be vacating on securing an alternative accommodation; the defendant did not do so, therefore, finally plaintiff served a registered notice on 6.4.64 asking the defendant to vacate the suit premises within 7 days, whereupon the defendant instead of vacating the house replied he was occupying the house on a contract for sale and hence the suit for ejectment.<br/><br/>3. The defendant Sled written statement and  his case  was that he approached the plaintiff for finding any suitable house for purchase when the plaintiff offered the suit house at a price of Tk. 1000/-; that the price has to be paid in installment of Tk. 5000/-; that on 14.8.56 the plaintiff accepted Tk. 1000/- as earnest money; that the plaintiff told the defen­dant to keep the transaction secret as his aunt Nalins kusim   was his co-sharer in the suit house; that the plaintiff had assured to exe­cute the kabala after obtaining a Nadabi from his aunt; that the defendant paid Tk. 7100/- in all upto February, 1963 and was willing to pay the balance and that he was in possession in part performance of the contract. On this averment the suit was contested.<br/><br/>4. The Trial Court dismissed the suit on ground that the contract for sale was more probable and the defendant was not a licen­see under the plaintiff. On appeal the appel­late Court below affirmed the decision and dismissed the appeal. Thereafter a Second Appeal was filed and the High Court Division remanded the appeal to the Appellate Court below for "rehearing on the ground that the First Appellate Court had not discussed the defence evidence and that the appellate Court had not given conceiving reason to the discard the evidence of the P. Ws.” This appeal being Other Appeal No. 310 of 1965 was disposed of on 15.8.70. The judgment and decree of the trial court below was again affirmed by the appellate Court below.<br/>On Second Appeal being S.A. No. 201 of 1972 the High Court Division formulated the point as under:<br/>''The question for decision in this appeal is whether the defendant in possession of the premises under an oral contract of sale as found by the Court of appeal below and inducted as such by the plaintiff in the premises, should be treated as a licences or not." <br/>The learned Single Judge on reviewing the evidence came to the conclusion that the defendant in the instant case having Ken in possession on the basis of an oral contract of sale, he has not acquired any interest in the premises. Thereafter the learned Judge considered the nature of the occupation of the defendant and came to the view that the defendant was a licensee under the plaintiff and in this view of the matter recorded the finding as under: <br/>''In my view as stated above the status of the defendant who has not acquired any title though in possession under oral agreement is a mere licensee and is liable to be evicted."  <br/>In this view of the matter the Second Ap­peal was allowed and the judgment and decree of both the courts below were set aside and the suit was decreed.<br/><br/>5. Leave was granted to consider the question "that the petitioners who are in possession of the suit premises in part performance of the oral agreement for sale on advance of Baina to the plaintiff respondent cannot be said to be in possession of the suit premises as a licensee under section 52 of the Ease­ment Act".<br/><br/>6. The defendant relied on oral contract and that was his case althrough. Though the trial court dismissed the suit of the plain­tiff, it expressed doubt as to the contract itself by recording the following observation: <br/>"I must say that the evidence adduced on defendant's behalf also is not satis­factory and worth reliance, and I must hold that the defendant also has failed to prove his case upto a reasonable satisfaction of the court". <br/>Then observed "In spite of the defendant's failure to prove his case, I have found from a discussion of the circumstances of the case that the defendant's story is the more prob­able".<br/><br/>7. The view of the High Court Division has been noticed above that it was an oral contract. Leave was granted to consider the question whether the oral contract could give rise to the doctrine of part performance which is embodied in section 53A of the Trans­fer of Property Act. Section 53A reads as under:<br/>"<strong>53A. </strong>Where any person contracts to transfer for consideration any immov­able property by writing signed by him or on his behalf from which the terms necessary to constitute the transfer can be ascertained with reasonable certainty, and the transferee has, in part perfor­mance of the contract, taken possession of the property or any part thereof, or the transferee, being already in possession, continues in possession in part perfor­mance of the contract and has done some act in furtherance of the con­tract, and the transferee has performed or is willing to perform his part of the contract, then, notwithstanding that the contracts, though required to be registered, has not, been registered, or, where there is no instrument of transfer, that the transfer has not been com­pleted in the manner prescribed therefore by the law for the time being in force, the transferor or any person claiming under him shall be debarred from enfor­cing against the transferee and persons claiming under him any right in respect of the property of which the transferee has taken or continued in possession, other than a right expressly provided by the terms of the contract:<br/>Provided that nothing is this section shall affect the rights of transferee for consideration who has no notice of the contract or of the part performance therefore.” <br/><br/>8. It is unnecessary to notice the history of the section which was enacted in 1929. It will be sufficient to note that the contract must be in writing as section itself opens up by saying “where any person contracts to transfer for consideration any immovable pro­perty by writing signed by him." The first requisite is the contract is to be written one unlike England where the Parol contract is admissible and by virtue of this section part performance does not give rise to an equity as in England but to a statutory right as give in section 53A. This right is more restricted than the English equity in two respects; (a) there must be a written contract and (2) it is only available as a defence. A formal least is not necessary to attract the application of section 53A. All that is required is that as agreement in writing signed by the transferor. In <strong><em>Maniklal Mansukhbhasi vs. Hormanji Jamshedji Ginwalla &amp; Sons, A.I.R. 1950 (SC) page 1</em></strong> in an action to eject a lessee on the ground that he had no registered deed of lease in his favour, the defendant lessee took the plea of part performance and proved that there was a written and signed contract in his favor and that he had taken possession in accor­dance with the terms of the agreement and he was paying rent to the plaintiff in accordance with the agreement. It was held that the de­fendant is entitled to retain possession in spite of absence of the registered deed. This is the relief that has been given by section 53A which is of doctrine of English part perfor­mance but the conditions precedent for attra­cting the section is the written agreement which in the present case is not to be found nor the defendant himself claimed that he had any written contract. His sole case was that it was an oral contract, in case of <strong><em>Krishna Sardar Vs. Sindhu Bala Dasi A.I.R. 1970 Cal. 444</em></strong> the plea of part performance was not available to the defendant when the defendant placed before the Court the Memorandum of recording fact of taking possession under agreement of exchange. It was held that such Memorandum is not a contract or deed of exchange which along on registration can pass title to the parties concerned. The Court observed “that the whole controversy between the parties rest on the fact of a me­morandum on the rights of the parties under section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act". The Court held that section 53A has no man­ner of application as it refers to a contract in writing which a memorandum is not. In this view of the matter there is no hesitation in saying that the learned Single Judge was correct in setting aside the judgment and decree of the courts below though the discus­sion is not to be found on section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act. The learned Single Judge was correct that the defendant was not better than a licensee and the appeal was correctly allowed in accordance with law.<br/><br/>In this view of the matter this appeal has no merit and therefore dismissed with costs and the judgment and decree of the High Court Division is maintained.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
