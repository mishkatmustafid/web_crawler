The petitioner instituted Title Suit No. 18 of 1990 in the 2nd Court of the learned Subordinate Judge, Sylhet for a declarations that the first schedule land is acquired land of the plaintiff and that the settlement in respect of second schedule land in favour of defendant No. 4 by defen­dant No.1 is illegal, void and collusive.<br/><br/>3. The case of the plaintiff, in short, is that the suit lands along with other lands orig­inally belonged to Cattle Breeding cum Diary Farm, Sylhet, which is now under the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestocks, Government of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh and the land was acquired in L.A. Case No. 235 of 1930-31 from differ­ent persons. The plaintiff had been in pos­session of the suit land and at the time of settlement operation, the suit second schedule land was wrongly recorded in favour of Government as <em>khas </em>land and defendant No.4 disclosed in the locality that he took lease of the land from govern­ment. The plaintiff came to know that the defendant No.4 took the alleged settle­ment from the Ministry of Lands with the help of Government's officer collusively. The record of right in favour of govern­ment is absolutely wrong and collusive and the defendant No.4 can not claim the suit property on the basis of alleged settle­ment and the defendant No. 1 has no right, title and interest in the second schedule land. The Government by Memo No.532 dated 21st May, 1986, cancelled the alleged lease deed in favour of defendant No.4 and thereafter the plaintiff came to know that the aforesaid cancellation order had already been set aside. The prepara­tion of record has created cloud in the plaintiff’s title.<br/><br/>4. The defendant Nos. 2, 3 and 5 filed joint written statement supporting the case of plaintiff and stated that they had no objec­tion if the suit is decreed in favour of the plaintiff. Defendant No. 4 Obaid Jaigirdar contested the suit by filing written state­ment denying the material allegations made in the plaint and contended, <em>inter alia</em>, that suit land is the government's <em>khas</em> land and accordingly the record was pre­pared. Defendant No.4 created a Trust for welfare and charitable purpose and the defendant No.4 being a trustee of the aforesaid trust wanted to develop a Housing Estate and to utilize income there from for the welfare and charitable pur­pose of the said trust. In view of that he prayed for settlement of the suit land in favour of O.J. trust on 16th January, 2008 and the Ministry of Lands settled by Memo No. 41-15/80 dated 19th February, 1980 and delivered possession in favour of the O.J. Trust. Defendant No. 4 built a mosque by the side of the Mazar with the help of the local people and established a bazar nearby for the facility of the Housing Estate and prepared the plan for the Housing Estate which became ready for construction but all on a sudden, the Government Cattle Breeding cum Diary Farm had been creating disturbance. The suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>5. The learned Joint District Judge, Sylhet dismissed the suit by the judgment and decree dated 13th April, 2003. Against the aforesaid judgment and decree, the plain­tiff preferred Title Appeal No.102 of 2003 before the learned District Judge, Sylhet, which was heard by the learned Additional District Judge, 1st Court, who by judg­ment and order dated 7th September, 2006 dismissed the same.<br/><br/>6. Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the aforesaid judgment and decree, the petitioner moved the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 2027 of 2007. A Single Bench of the High Court Division made the rule absolute.<br/><br/>7.  Mr. Goutum Kumar Roy, the Deputy Attorney General for the petitioner sub­mits that the learned Judge of the High Court Division erred in law in not interfer­ing with the judgment of the court of appeal below in failing to consider that the learned Additional District Judge being the last court of facts should have proper­ly considered the oral and documentary evidence on record and thereby committed error of law in dismissing the appeal with­out application of judicial mind. He fur­ther submitted that having regard to the fact that the suit land was acquired in L.A. Case No. 235 of 1930-33 from different persons and is being used as Cattle Breeding cum Diary Firm under the con­trol of the Ministry of Fisheries and live­stock's, which fact having been admitted by the defendant Nos. 2, 3 and 5, the learned Single Judge without considering the said admitted fact affirmed the judg­ment and thereby committed error of law occasioning failure of justice.<br/><br/>8. We have heard the learned Deputy Attorney General and perused the con­nected papers   including the impugned judgment. There are concurrent findings that the plaintiff has failed to prove its possession in the suit land and that the suit has not been instituted with the proper authority of the government and in that view of the matter, the learned Judge of the High Court Division has committed no error of law in not interfering with the judgment of the Court of appeal below. We do not find any substance on the points raised. The High Court Division upon cor­rect assessment of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision. We, there­fore, find no reason to interfere with the same.<br/><br/>The petition is accordingly dismissed.<br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
