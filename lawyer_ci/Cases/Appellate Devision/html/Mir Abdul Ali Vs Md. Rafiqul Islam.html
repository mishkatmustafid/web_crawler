Respondent filed Title Suit No. 355 of 1976 for mere declaration of his title to the suit land and by subsequent amendment of the plaint he prayed for permanent injunction.<br/><br/>3. The trial court dismissed the suit and found that the plaintiff never had got the possession of the suit land. It was noticed that the plaintiff claimed to have purchased the suit land at a consideration of Tk. 3,000/- on 8.7.1974 but on evidence it was established that the defendant entered into agreement to purchase it at a consideration of Tk. 8000/- on 30.12.72. It was observed: "that he got the delivery of possession of the suit land just after execution of the bainapatra in his favour in 1972". In this view of the matter the trial court dismissed the suit. On appeal the Appellate Court below noticed that the plaintiff introduced a new story that his father possessed the land before his purchase as borgather of Alauddin Bhuiyan. But the evidence shows “he was silent about his dispossession in the 1st petition for amendment of the plaint." Whereas from the evidence of the plaintiff it appeared "that he was dispossessed from the suit land on the date of filing of the suit." In view of the evidence, the Appellate Court dismissed the appeal.<br/><br/>4. In revision the Single Bench of the High Court Division set aside the judgment and decree of the courts below and decreed the plaintiff’s suit with direction to give him possession on eviction of the defendant appellant and accordingly, made the rule absolute.<br/><br/>5. Leave was granted to consider the question when the possession of the defendant is established and when the evidence was led to show that the plaintiff himself was present at the time of negotiation of sale to the defendant whether the High Court Division was correct in reversing the concurrent finding of fact, which showed that the defendant entered into possession after the execution of the baina-patra dated 30.12.1972. Whereas the plaintiff claimed by a document dated 8.7.1974 and the suit was brought in 1976. Incidentally the question was raised whether on the principle of section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act the defendant is protected.<br/><br/>6. Dr. Kamal Hossain, learned Counsel appearing for the defendant-appellant submitted that the High Court Division erroneously overlooked that the title of the defendant related back to 30.12.72 the date of execution of the deed of agreement for sale (bainapatra) followed by the delivery of possession on receipt of the earnest money as per terms of the agreement for sale. Dr. Kamal Hossain argued that it was not the question of competition of the sale deeds as to which one will prevail over the other as considered by the learned single Judge. It was submitted that the positive and consistent case of the defendant appellant was that his purchase being earlier on the basis of the bainapatra accompanied with the delivery of possession; right, title and interest in the suit land devolved upon him on the day of execution of the bainapatra and the plaintiff would not acquire any right, title, interest and possession by his subsequent and collusive deed of purchase.<br/><br/>7. It is true that the document of the defendant as registered later in 1975, but the finding of fact the two Courts below was that the defendant was in possession of the suit land since 30.12.72 in pursuance of the bainanama.<br/><br/>8. Dr. Kamal Hossain, learned Counsel next argued that the equitable principle as laid down in section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act is available to the appellant, in view of the fact that in part performance of the contract the appellant took the possession of the suit land and the contract was finally concluded by registration of the sale deed by the vendor on receipt of the balance consideration money.<br/><br/>9. Mr.Md. Nurul Huq, learned Counsel appearing for the plaintiff-respondent, attempted to argue that the bainapatra was created for the purpose of anticipated suit against the appellant and further I submitted that in the alleged agreement it was not mentioned that possession was delivered to the appellant on the execution of the agreement.<br/><br/>10. There is no substance in this contention. The agreement was found genuine by the two Courts below. Even the learned Single Judge did question it. As for the second part of the contention is not the requirement of law that the bainapatra must mention that possession was delivered in pursuance of the agreement.<br/><br/>11. Mr. Md. Nurul Huq further argued that equitable principle as can be found in section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act cannot have any application, in view of the fact that it is the Registration Act that determines the issue when there is competition between two contending parties on the basis of two deeds and since the plaintiffs document was registered earlier in point of time the deed of the plaintiff will prevail over that of the defendant.<br/><br/>12. On his own showing section 47 comes into play and that is the complete answer to the contention, namely, that though the plaintiff's document is earlier in point of time as because it was registered in 1974 and the defendant's document was registered later in 1975, but the defendant's document relates back to the bainapatra dated 30.12.72 and in pursuance of which the document of the defendant was registered by the vendor. Hence it is the defendant's document that will prevail of the plaintiff’s document and the defendant is in possession which was established on evidence.<br/><br/>13. It is well settled that in the case of successive transfers of the self-same property in favour of different persons by a common vendor by registered documents, the dispute as to the precedence of one document over the other is to be determined in accordance with the principle laid down in section 47 of the Registration Act. That section provides:<br/>"A registered document shall operate from the time from which it would have commenced to operate if no registration thereof had been required or made; and not from the time of its registration."<br/>It is clear that a document that has been registered relates back to the date of its execution and when the question of title as between the two contestants claiming on the basis of successive documents executed by the self-same vendor must be determined with reference to the title to the latter on the date of execution and not of registration.<br/><br/>14. In the case of <em><strong>Fazar Ali and another Vs. Afzal Mia and others 9 DLR 258</strong></em> <strong>Imam Hossain Chowdhury, J.,</strong> posed the question:<br/>"Suppose a man purchases a property 'A' on the 7th of a month and another man purchases the self-same property on the 9th of the month and the first man got the kabala registered on the 13th and the second man got that kabala registered on the 12th of the month. Now the question arises which document will prevail. There is no doubt the answer would be that the kabala which was executed earlier would prevail over the kabala executed later, though registered earlier. So, the date of registration is not a criterion for the purpose of determining when the sale takes effect though without registration certain transactions may be perfected."<br/><br/>15. The dictum of <strong>Imam Hossain Chowdhury, J, </strong>was doubted by a learned Single Judge and he felt that Fazar Ali's case should be re-examined by a larger Bench. On reference made by him the case was referred to a Division Bench <em><strong>(Jainullah and another Vs. Ami Mia and others 15 DLR 77)</strong></em> before <strong>Hasan and Ali, J.</strong> In that case it was contended that a purchaser who has perfected his title by his document registered acquires an indefeasible title as against anyone claiming under a document registered on a later date, even though that might have been executed earlier. This contention was repelled by the Division Bench and reliance was placed in the case of <em><strong>Jeo Narayan Matho vs. Budhan Matho and others AIR 1941 Pat 247</strong></em> when a Division Bench considered the same question and <strong>Harris, CJ.,</strong> observed:<br/>“Where a land is sold to A by executing a sale deed which is unregistered and subsequently the same land is sold to B by registered deed, and sale deed executed in favour of A is registered after sale in favour of B, the sale deed in favour of A operates not from the date of its registration but from the date of its execution. Hence sale in favour of B which is subsequent to execution of sale deed in favour of A does not give B good title against A."<br/><br/>16. The Division Bench came to the conclusion that section 47 is intended to safeguard the interest of a bona fide vendee under an instrument, which though only executed is waiting registration by ensuring that he is not deprived of the property in case of his vendor turns round to take advantage of the fact that the said instrument is still unregistered and executes a fresh kabala and gets it registered as well purporting to convey the self-same property in favour of another. It was observed that any contrary view would mean defeating the very purpose of section 47.<br/><br/>17. As it has been noticed already in the present case the defendant appellant entered into an agreement to purchase it on 30.12.72 and got the delivery' of possession of the suit land immediately after execution of the bainapatra in his favour in 1972 whereas the plaintiff claimed to have purchased at a much lower figure, namely, for Tk. 3,000/- the self same land on 8.7.74.The question was which of the two documents will prevail. Both the Courts below dismissed the suit. But in revision the learned Single Judge <strong>M. A. Hossain, J, </strong>set aside the judgments and decrees of the Courts below and the learned Judge considered that section 53A was not available to the defendant, inasmuch as no such case was made out in the written statement. It was overlooked by the learned Judge that on the showing of the plaintiff himself the defendant was in possession of the suit land in furtherance of his bainapatra. The equitable principle as given in section 53A can be invoked by the defendant for protecting his possession but since the defendant is protected by the provision of section 47 of the Registration Act, this point needs no further consideration.<br/><br/>18. In the result, the appeal is allowed. The judgment of the High Court Division is set aside and those of the Courts below are restored. There will be no order as to costs.<br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
