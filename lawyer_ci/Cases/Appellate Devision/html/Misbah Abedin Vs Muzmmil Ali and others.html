The case of the plaintiff is that the owner of the disputed plot Nos. 1642 and 1643 along with one Haji Abdur Raquib and they became the owner of the plot of Dag No. 1642 by way of jote settlement and of plot in Dag No.1643 by way of possessing the said land jointly in equal shares and subsequently Haji Abdur Raquib transferred his 8 annas share to the plaintiff in lieu of appropriate consideration money on 15.12.1960 and as there existed friendly relationship between the plaintiff and Haji Abdur Raquib, no kabala was executed or registered but subsequently in order to avoid any future complication, Haji Abdur Raquib by a registered deed dated 09.06.1989 admitted the sale of the said property in the year 1960 to the plaintiff and the plaintiff thus became the owner and possessor of disputed Dag Nos. 1642 and 1643 alongwith other land and by constructing houses thereon he started living  thereon where there is a pond and a vegetable garden also. The plaintiff and Haji Abdur Raquib were earlier possessing some portion of land under Indra Bhusan Deb and others by way of jote settlement and when the property was wrongly recorded in the name of the earlier joteder, the plaintiff and Haji Abdur Raquib on 06.01.1961 filed objection case No.190 which was allowed on 09.02.1961 in presence of both the parties and the names of the joteders were deleted and the order was passed for recording the names of the plaintiff and Haji Abdur Raquib in 1.35 decimals of land in Dag Nos.1646 and 1647 which was subsequently transferred on 18.07.1961 by the plain­tiff and Haji Abdur Raquib by way of kabala in favour of the predecessor of the     contesting defendant, Haji Siddique Ali, and the said Siddique Ali after the purchase was in possession in the land and on his death, his heirs were enjoying the suit land.<br/><br/>3. Defendant Nos. 6 and 7 before the institution of the suit spread the rumors that some land of the disputed Dag Nos.1642 and 1643 were gifted away to them by Abdus Satter, a son of Haji Siddique Ali and after knowing this, the plaintiff collected the certified copy of the said gift deed on 26.05.1988 and came to know that Abdus Satte, son of Haji Siddique Ali, claiming himself as the only heir of his wife Efatunnessa Khanam, claimed to be the owner of 0.10 decimals of land on the west-southern side of the disputed Dag No.1642 and 0.10 decimals of land on the western side of Dag No.1643 claiming that his wife Efatunnessa Khanam purchased on  29.01.1962 from her father-in-law, Siddique Ali, and then she gifted away the said property to defendant Nos.6 and 7. The plaintiff also came to know after obtaining the certified copy of the kabalas that Siddique Ali narrated in the kabala that he purchased the land from Haji Abdur Raquib and the plaintiff and thereafter, transferred the same to his daughter-in-law but in fact the plaintiff and Haji Abdur Raquib Ali never sold the plot of the disputed dag numbers to Siddique Ali and hence Efatunnessa never got any title by way of purchase from Siddique Ali by the 6 kabala deed on 29.01.1962 and defendant Nos.6 and 7 did not get any title by virtue of the deed of gift from Efatunnessa and in fact the plaintiff and Haji Abdur Raquib sold 0.85 decimals of Dag No.1646 and 0.50 decimals of Dag No.1647 in total 1.35 decimal of land to Haji Siddque Ali and they never sold any land of disputed  Dag No. 1642 and 1643 but since the  responsibility of writing the kabala was given to Haji Siddique Ali, he with ulterior motive changed the dag numbers from Dag Nos.1646 and 1647 to Dag Nos.1642 and 1643 and although Haji Siddique Ali changed the dag numbers in the kabala, he did not earn any title and possession by way of purchase on the disputed land and the plaintiff is in possession for a long time and is enjoying the suit land on which the defendants or their predecessors never had any title or possession and when the defendants created some kabalas in favour of defendant  Nos.6 and 7 relating to some portion of  the disputed land, the title of the plaintiff was clouded and furthermore, when the defendant threatened the plaintiff of dispossession from the suit land, the plaintiff was constrained to file the suit for declaration of title and for permanent injunction.<br/><br/>4. Defendant Nos.1-3 and 6 contested in the suit by filing written statement denying the material allegations made in the plaint and they claimed that their predecessor, Haji Siddique Ali, purchased the suit property from the plaintiff and Haji Abdur Raquib and thereafter the defendants are in possession of the suit land. Their case is that after the purchase, Haji Siddique Ali transferred the property in favour of his daughter-in-law by virtue of a kabala deed dated 24.01.1962 and subsequently Siddique Ali died and after some years his daughter-in-law also died and thereafter defendant No.1, Abdus Satter on returning from U.S.A. in 1988 started a Madrasha and when the local people requested him to give some land by way of gift for the Madrasha, he gifted some land on 08.02.1988 from the disputed dag numbers and in other portion of the land there were banana trees and other fruit trees which the defendants were in possession and the plaintiff being an influential person and a habitual litigant, taking the advantage of the absence of Abdus Satter, a resident of  U.S.A., in order to grab the property, instituted the present suit and the transfer deed dated 09.06.1989 is a collusive and a pre-planned one and Haji Abdur Raquib never transferred the disputed property in favour of the plaintiff either on 15.12.1960 or on 09.06.1989 and in fact the plaintiff and Haji Abdur Raquib on 18.07.1961 transferred the disputed land in favour  of the predecessor Haji Siddique Ali and subsequently for unlawful gain filed this suit claiming that in place of the disputed land, plots in Dage Nos.1646 and 1647 were sold to the predecessor of the defendants on 18.07.1961. One Mujahid Ali on 31.01.1961 purchased the land of Dag Nos.1646 and 1647 by a kabala from Kumud Chandra Chakroborty and was in possession of the same and the plaintiff filed a false objection case on the recording of the land in the name of Kumud Chandra Chakroborty and subsequently in collusion with the officer of the collectorate office recorded the land in his name and the settlement Case No.190 related to wrong recording of land of Dag Nos.1642 and 1643 have no connection with Dag Nos.1646 and 1647 and the plaintiff in order to grab the property filed the instant suit which is liable to be dismissed.                                                <br/><br/>5. Mr. Mahmudul Islam, learned Counsel, appearing for the petitioner submitted that the Courts below and the High Court Division committed error in not taking into consideration the schedule of exhibit-'Ka' dated 18.07.1961 by which the plaintiff and Abdur Raquib sold the property in favour Siddique Ali and the schedule of exhibit-3 dated 15.11.1960 by which the plaintiff and Abdur Raquib acquired the same property inasmuch as the comparison of the schedules of the said two deeds unmistakably shows that the plaintiff sold the same land to Siddique Ali which the plaintiff and Haji Abdur Raquib purchased by exihibit-3. The learned Counsel further submitted that none of the Courts con­sidered that no evidence was led to show that there was any fraudulent insertion of plot number in exhibit-'Ka' by Siddique Ali; that the suit for con­firmation of possession and permanent injunction was not maintainable with­out any relief against exhibit-'Ka’ dated 18.07.1961 and the suit filed after 28 years was misconceived and barred by limitation; that the High Court Division committed an error in not admitting into evidence the docu­ments which the petitioner produced as additional evidence which clearly reveals the case of the plaintiff-peti­tioner. The learned Counsel finally submitted that local investigation was redundant in the face of recital in exhibit-3 and exhibit-'Ka'; that plain­tiff-respondent refrained from depos­ing in the suit and kabala by Abdur Raquib in favour of the plaintiff two months before the sale on 09.06.1989 was collusive and fraudulent and Abdur Raquib had no saleable interest.<br/><br/>6. T.H.Khan learned Counsel with Dr.A.K.M. Ali, Advocate, appearing for the respondent No.1 submitted that the Courts below believed the case of the plaintiff and after elaborate discus­sion and assigning cogent reasonings arrived at certain findings and the High Court Division under revisional jurisdiction had no scope to interfere with it. The learned Counsel further submitted that the interference is not warranted when the concurrent find­ings of fact do not suffer from any legal infirmity as in the present case; that the main point to be looked into in this matter is whether Dag Nos.1642 and 1643 as mentioned in the impugned kabalas were sold to the defendant or to see whether it was the intention of the plaintiff to sell the plots in Dag Nos.1646 and 1647, which are disputed questions of fact and the Courts below after perusal of the khatians, mouza, map, the report of the Advocate Commissioner after local inspection and after taking into consid­eration the evidence of witnesses, came to concurrent findings. He point­ed out that the local inspection was held for the identification of the suit land and the deposition of the plaintiff and the defendant witnesses relates to the possession of the suit land and P.W.1-8 categorically supported the case of the plaintiff regarding his possession on the suit and but on the other had D.W.1 made no specific assertion about the possession, D.W.2 being a caretak­er of the defendant and interested wit­ness was not believed by the Courts below and D.W.3 also could not iden­tify the suit land.<br/><br/>7. The learned Counsel further submit­ted that it is not a case of adverse pos­session and the main point is whether the property which was sold to the defendant was   rightly or wrongly recorded in the kabala deed and whether the plaintiff is in possession of the suit land and the Courts after tak­ing into consideration the oral and documentary evidence found the plaintiff to be in possession of the suit land and also determined the identifi­cation of the land. That the application filed by the petitioner under Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure for admitting additional evidence on record cannot be entertained at this stage as it was not a case of the peti­tioner before the trial Court or the appellate Court and having failed to do so before the Courts below they arc submitting those at this stage before the  revisional  Court  and  moreover, some documents that have been annexed in the application for admit­ting as additional evidence, are dated long after the delivery of judgment by the Court of Appeal below.<br/><br/>8. The learned Counsel further submit­ted that a Court of law is always com­petent even in a declaratory suit to cor­rect a mistake if the plaintiff does not take separate action for the rectifica­tion of the instrument; that failure to rectify a sale deed does not extinguish the title of the property which was really sold but not properly described in the sale deed due to mistake inas­much as there is no misreading or non-consideration of the material evidence on record by the Courts below in order to disturb the concurrent findings of the Courts below.<br/><br/>9. It appears from the record that both the Courts below held that the plaintiff and Haji Abdur Raquib acquired a plot in Dag No.1642 by way of jote settle­ment from one Indu Bhushan Dhar and others and got their names recorded in the Khatian and got a plot in Dag No. 1643 by way of purchase and got their names recorded in Khatian by fil­ing the Objection Case No.416 of 1962 and both of them became owners to the extent of 8 annas share each and Abdur Raquib sold his 8 annas share of both the plots in Dag Nos.1642 and 1643 to the plaintiff verbally  on  15.12.1960 followed by delivery of possession and then executed a kabala on 09.06.1989 in support of the earlier sale and thus lost his interest in the suit land. The Court of appeal below specifically found that Haji Abdur Raquib's pres­ence was not necessary in the suit.<br/><br/>10. It also appears from the record that a local investigation was held for which notice was served upon the par­ties and their Advocates but none appeared from the defendant's side and the investigation took place and the report was duly submitted before the Court and the Advocate Commissioner who held the investigation was also examined as RW.2, although objection was raised against the said report by the defendant, thought it was not taken into consideration by the trial Court but against which no appeal or revi­sion was preferred before the higher Court. The Courts found that the suit land does not attract Dag Nos. 1646 and 1647 and the plaintiff by adducing oral and documentary evidence proved that the plaintiff is in possession of the plots in Dag Nos. 1642 and 1643 and these concurrent findings of the Courts below arrived at on consideration of the evidence on record could not be disturbed by this Court.<br/><br/>11. The High Court Division observed that the Courts below have committed no error of law in passing the judg­ments. After due consideration of the evidence, oral and documentary and the attending circumstances consid­ered by th6 Courts below this Court do not like to interfere with the impugned judgment as there is no illegality or impropriety in the decisions of the Courts below calling for any interfer­ence.<br/><br/>In view of the above, we find no substance in the submissions of the learned Counsel for the petitioner.<br/>Accordingly, the petition is dis­missed.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
