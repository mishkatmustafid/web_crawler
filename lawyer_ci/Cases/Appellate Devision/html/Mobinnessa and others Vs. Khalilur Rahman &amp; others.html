No. 213 of l973.)<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Judgment</strong></span><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Shahabuddin Ahmed J.—</strong>In this appeal by the plaintiffs the. question is whether the decree obtained by, them in their suit for setting .aside the decree of a previous parti­tion suit, namely, T.S. No.21 of 1965, has been reversed on correct appreciation of facts and proper application of law. The plaintiffs' suit, namely T.S.No.93 of 1966, was decided by the trial Court namely, the Second Court of Subordinate Judge, Barisal, on 8 July 1967. But on appeal the decree was reversed by the Additional District Judge on 28 April 1973 in Title Appeal No. 203 of 1967; this decision of the appel­late Court has been upheld by a learned Single Judge of the High Court Division on 18 November 1982 in Second Appeal No. 213 of 1976; both these Courts took the concurrent view that plaintiffs' suit is not maintainable as five of them were not parties to the partition suit but one of them was a party.<br/><br/>2. The suit property, as the appellants' case in T.S. No. 93 of 1966 shows, belonged to proforma-defendants Nos. 4 to 55 and plaintiffs Nos.5 and 6, and this property has been described in 'ka' schedule of the plaint. Respondent, defendant No.1, Shamsuddin (died since then and has been duly substituted) had filed the previous suit T.S. No.21 of 1965, claiming partition of his 8-annas share in the suit land against defend­ant Nos. 2 and 4 of the present suit who were principal defendants, Nos.1 to 3, in the previous suit alleging that those three defendants had also acquired, along with him, the remaining 8 annas share. The basis of their shares was slated to be a settlement in the year 1354 B.S., corresponding to 1948 A.D., from the ex-landlords, namely proforma defendants Nos. 4 to 55 and others as stated above. In the said partition suit which was filed on 29 March 1965 defend­ant Nos.1 to 3 (principal defendants), and proforma-defendants Nos. 4, 10, 19, 22 and 39 filed a compromise petition within 9 days, which is on 7 April 1965, admitting the plain­tiffs’ claim and on that compromise peti­tion the suit was decreed that very day in terms of the compromise petition.<br/><br/>3. The appellants filed the present suit for a declaration that the compromise decree in the partition suit is void, fraudulent and collusive and not binding upon them.  In support of their claim they set forth a number of grounds, such as ; they (appellants-plaintiffs 1 to 5) were not parties to the said partition suit but their lands were includ­ed in the suit property which was sought to be partitioned, that the respondent (plain­tiff of that suit) got no title or possession at all but his claim as to title by settlement was totally false, that he acted in collusion with the principal defendants of that suit who also claimed 8-annas share by a similar false claim to settlement, that the said  suit was filed as a partition suit to establish title by circumventing Ordinance No.1 of 1964 which put restriction on the filing of any declara­tory suit in respect of landed property of a member of minority-community, that sum­mons of that suit was fraudulently suppres­sed in that three of the defendants were already dead and most of the other defend­ants  had left Pakistan for India long before the filing of the  suit.<br/><br/>4. The allegations contained in these grounds were denied by the respondent, plaintiff of that partition suit. The trial Court on evidence decreed the appellants suit setting aside the decree of the partition suit, among other things, on the following grounds; that plaintiff of the partition suit totally failed to prove his prima facie title to the suit land by any settlement, that three of the defendants having died and others having left the country before the filing of the suit, the purported service of notice upon them was a clear fraud, that the plaintiffs of the present suit who got shares in the suit land having not been made parties to the partition suit, not only the decree passed in that suit is not bind­ing upon them, but the partition suit itself was not maintainable for want of necessary parties.<br/><br/>5. The lower Appellate Court as well as the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division concurrently held that since the plain­tiffs Nos.1 to 5 were not parties to the partition suit, the decree passed in that suit is not binding upon them, and as such, they need not worry about it, and in case they feel that their title has been clouded by the decree, they may file a suit for declaration of their title.  As to plaintiff   No. 6 who was a party to the partition suit, these courts held that he is debarred from filing the present, suit for setting aside the decree.<br/><br/>6. Judgment of the High Court Division shows that the suit of the appellants was held to be not maintainable for two op­posing reasons, and this has also been pointed out by Mr. B.N. Chowdhury learned Advocate for the appellants. One reason is that so far as plaintiffs 1-5 (appel­lants Nos.1-5) are concerned, the suit is not maintainable as they were not parties and their interest was not affected by the decree; and the other reason is that so far as plaintiff No.6 (appellant No. 6) is concerned, as he was a party thereto he cannot challenge the decree. We find it very difficult to get to the logic of this argument set forth by these courts particularly, the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division, in holding that the appellant's suit far setting aside the decree passed in the partition suit is not maintainable. The trial Court in an elaborate judgment arrived at a number of findings including the finding that three of the defendants having been dead and most of the other defendants having left the country before the filing of the suit, the decree was obtained by fraudulent suppression of summons and that by resorting to a partition suit the respondent (plaintiff in that suit) got his title established by avoiding the provisions of Ordinance No.I of 1964 which barred the filing of any declaratory suit in respect of property belonging to a member of the minority community. For the purpose of disposal of this appeal we need not refer to all these findings, but we shall concentrate on the finding as to defect of party. In the partition suit five of the appel­lants, namely, plainintiffs Nos.1-5 were not impleaded. In a partition suit, the established principle of Law is that all co-sharers shall be impleaded and that failure to implead any co-sharer shall render the suit liable for dismis­sal on the ground of maintainability. This principle of law was also accepted by the learned Single Judge of the High Court Divi­sion, but the learned Judge fell into an utter confusion as to which of the two suits before him this principle is to be applied in. The learned Single Judge, after agreeing with the appellants that defect of party is fatal to a partition suit, observed:<br/>"But in the present case it is not a partition suit but is a suit for declaration that the sale-decree passed in the parti­tion suit is not binding upon the plaintiff; moreover the plaintiffs could not show that in the present suit there is any defect of party."<br/>It should be kept in mind that it is not the Title Suit No. 93 of 1966, filed by the appel­lants themselves, which they are challenging on the ground of defect of parties; but it is the partition suit, T.S. No. 21 of 1965, whose decree has been challenged by them on the ground of defect of, party Admittedly T.S. No. 21 of 1965 was a partition suit in which five of the six appellants were not parties. As such the partition suit was liable to be dismissed on this ground alone the appellants filed their suit challenging the de­cree of the respondent's partition suit to challenge the decree of partition suit, it is not necessary that another partition suit is to be filed.<br/><br/>7. Mr. Md. Ayub, learned Advocate for the respondent-defendant No.1, has made strenuous efforts to defend the impugned Judgment of the High Court Division taking resort to a novel argument. It is that in every suit it is for the plaintiff to decide whom he will implead and against whom he will sect relief and according to the plaintiff of the Partition suit these appellants were not his co-sharers in the suit property and as such he is not required to implead in his suit the appellants who were mere strangers to him, So far as a stranger is concerned, the learned Advocate is perfectly correct in his argument, for a stranger need not be impleaded in a partition suitor for that master in any suit But when the stranger's property is included in a suit the "stranger" must be impleaded as a party, for a person having any interest or share in the disputed property cannot be avoided by simply branding him a stranger. Facts proved before the trial court are that Tarak Saha was a recorded co-sharer in the holding comprising R.S Khatian Nos. 60, 61 and 61 (3) of Mouza Takshar (vide Exts.5 to 5 (b) ) on whose death his son, Chitta Ranjan Shaha, inherited his share, and that it is this Chitta Ranjan from whom the appellants purchased his share by a registered kabala and that it is this share which  has been included in the suit land which was sought to be partitioned in T.S. No. 21 of 1965. On the face of record the plaintiff appellants were necessary parties to the partition suit but were left out. Contention of the learned Advocate is therefore devoid of any substance. The learned Advocate has made a last minute effort to salvage the impugned judgment of the High Court Division arguing that the appellants' suit for setting aside the decree of the partition suit is not maintainable without a prayer for establishment of their title. Evi­dence shows that they have got title as well as possession in their share of the suit holding. In these circumstances their suit for declara­tion of nullity of the decree of the partition suit to which they were not party is quite maintainable. On the ground of defect of party alone that suit fell through as a whole.<br/><br/>8. In the result, the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment of the High Court Division confirming that of the lower Appellate Court is set aside and that of the trial court is restored. No order as to costs.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
