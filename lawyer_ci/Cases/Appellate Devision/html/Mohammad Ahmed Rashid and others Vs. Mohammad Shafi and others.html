The facts of the case, in brief, are that respondent No.1 as plaintiff filed Other Class Suit No.42 of 1987 under section 14(2) of the Arbitration Act, 1940 in the Court of Assis­tant Judge, Chakaria under District Cox's Ba­zar stating, <em>inter-alia</em>, that, the land described in plaint belonged to Nur Ahmed and others. Accordingly P.R.R. and M.R.R. Khatians have been prepared and published. Nur Ah­med and others were in need of money and sold the same to the plaintiff who has pos­sessed the same by paying rent. The petitioner Nos.1-3 have no right, title, interest and pos­session in the suit land. That the suit land is far from the house of plaintiff and nearer to the house of petitioner Nos.1-3 also with ill motive claimed right, title and interest in the suit land and also threatened with disposses­sion. As a result, there was a dispute between the parties, and at the instance of local leaders both parties agreed to settle the dispute through arbitration. Proforma respondent Nos. 2-7 were appointed arbitrator in pursuance of a deed of Ekrar Nama dated 29.4.1985. Re­spondent Nos. 2-7 then served notice upon both parties who duly appeared and submitted their written statements and documents in support of their respective claims. Both par­ties also made their oral submission. Respondent Nos. 2-7 as Arbitrator after examining witnesses and considering necessary papers and documents passed the award on 30.8.1986. The award was executed and regis­tered and thereafter respondent No. 1 re­quested the Arbitrators to send the award along with necessary papers and documents to the Court for making the same a rule of the Court. Arbitrators failed and then plaintiff-respondent No. 1 filed the present suit. There­after, respondent No. 1 on 4.8.1988 filed an application before the Court of Assistant un­der section 17 of the Arbitration Act for pass­ing decree in terms of award dated 30.8.1986. Proforma -respondent Nos. 2-7 appeared be­fore the Court and filed joint written state­ment admitting the award. Their contention is that they have been appointed as Arbitrator by both parties and in pursuance of an Ekrar-nama dated 29.4.1985 they served notice upon both parties who duly appeared and submitted written statements and other necessary papers and documents in support of their respective claim. They have also adduced evidence and perusing the necessary papers they passed the award and executed and registered the same on 30.8.1986. They further contended that they have fairly and impartially conducted the arbitration and the arbitrators have not mis­conducted themselves.<br/><br/>3. The petitioner Nos.1-3 as defendant contested the suit by filing written statement stating, <em>inter-alia</em>, that the suit is not maintain­able as there was no cause of action. That Nur Ahmed and others did not sell the suit land to the respondent No.1 and that they did not threaten respondent with dispossession from the, suit land. Their contention is that they have got right, title, interest and possession in the suit land and that they never appointed proforma respondent Nos.4-9 as arbitrator on 29.4.1985. There had been no arbitration proceeding in the suit land and that they did never appear before the arbitration proceeding nor submitted any statement or document and the Arbitrators did not serve any notice and also did not pass any award.<br/><br/>4. The trial Court decreed the suit making the award a rule of the Court. The appeal there from however was allowed setting aside the same. The respondent thereafter success­fully moved the High Court Division.<br/><br/>5. Mrs. Sufia Khatun, the learned Advocate-on-Record appearing for the petitioners submitted that in view of the first schedule to the Arbitration Act which mandated that the Arbitrator/Arbitrators shall make the award within 6 months after entering on the refer­ence or within the time extended by the Court and admittedly the award has been passed beyond the period of time without any exten­sion from the Court, the arbitrators ceased to have jurisdiction in passing the award which is not award in the eye of law and referred to the case of <em>Md. Ismail Vs. Munshi Ali Hossain </em>reported in<em> 60 DLR 641</em> in support of the proposition.<br/><br/>6. The High Court Division, However, has relied upon a decision in the case of Govt. of Bangladesh represented by Director of Movement and Storage Department of <em>Food Vs. Jalaluddin Ahmed </em>reported in<em> 37 DLR (AD) 27</em> wherein this Court held that when the arbitration proceeding continued beyond 4 months with the parties raising no objection- conclusion is the party concerned has waived its right and accordingly even after the reflex of time the award passed was held to be valid.<br/><br/>7. Section 3 of the Arbitration Act pro­vides that unless a different intention is ex­pressed in the arbitration agreement if shall be deemed to include the provisions set put in the First Schedule which enacts that the arbitra­tors shall make their award within four months after entering on the reference or after having been called upon to act by notice in writing from any party to the arbitration agreement or within such extended time as the Court may allow. Thus where the arbitration agreement did not provide for the time within which Arbitrators shall make their award but made the award beyond four months from the date of entering on the reference the question arises as to whether the award before such period without any extension of time is valid or not.<br/><br/>8. In the case of <em>Md. Ismail Serang vs. Munshi Ali Hussain and others </em>reported in<em> 6 DLR 641</em> Ibrahim J. held:<br/>"In this case the learned Subordinate Judge was evidently wrong in the view that as there was no time fixed for submit­ting the award by the arbitrators under the terms of Ex.1, they had every right to deliver the award on such a date as might be suitable to them. Section 3 of the Arbi­tration Act provides that unless a different intention is expressed in the arbitration agreement, it shall be deemed to include the provisions set out in the First Sched­ule in so far as they are applicable to the reference. As no time was fixed by the reference in this case, the agreement must be deemed to include the provisions of section 3 of the First Schedule which en­acts that the arbitrators shall make their award within four months after entering on the reference or after having been called upon to act by notice in writing from any party to the arbitration agree­ment or within such extended time as the Court may allow. The arbitrators were bound to make the award if any within four months after entering on the reference. Admittedly, they did not make any award within four months from the 27 of April, 1945, when, according to the find­ing of the learned Munsif, they had en­tered on the reference. The learned Sub­ordinate Judge's view that section 3 of the First Schedule could not apply to the case, it being a case of arbitration without in­tervention of a Court, is thoroughly wrong. He has overlooked that section 3 is within chapter II of the Act, which deals with arbitration without intervention of a Court. When this section states that in the absence of any intention the arbitra­tion agreement shall be deemed to include the provisions of the First Schedule, it re­fers to arbitration without the intervention of a Court. In these circumstances it was not necessary to remand the case for the decision, of issue No. 2, Namely, whether the deed of reference was valid, for as­suming that the reference was valid, the award cannot be sustained inasmuch as it was made after the arbitrator had ceased to have jurisdiction."<br/><br/>9. But in the case of <em>Government of Bangladesh Vs. Jalaluddin Ahmed </em>reported in<em> 37DLR (AD) 27</em> refrred to by the High Court Division it has been held upon consideration of the case reported in <em>6 DLR 41</em> that:<br/>"From the conduct of the parties to the arbitration agreement, particularly the re­spondent, it appears that no objection was raised by either of the parties to the arbi­tration proceeding that the award could not be passed as the period mentioned in Article (3) had already expired, nor did the respondent inform the Arbitrator that he would not be bound by any award since the time for passing it had expired. This should be considered as waiver of the condition regarding limitation for passing the award. In support, the learned Additional Attorney-General cited a few decisions. In <em>Haji Ghulam Mohyuddin vs. Federation of Pakistan, PLD 1967 Lah. 204</em>, similar point was involved as to whether the award given four months af­ter the arbitrator entered upon the refer­ence was void being in violation of para­graph 3 of the First Schedule of the Arbi­tration Act. As already seen, its provi­sions were to be considered as implied terms of the Arbitration agreement as laid down in section 3 of the Act. In observing that the provisions of the first Schedule in so far as they were made the terms of the Arbitration agreement did not acquire a status higher than the other terms of the same, the Court observed:<br/>"The proposition is well-settled that if the terms of any agreement are not complied with in this respect, the consequence is not that the award be­comes invalid. If from the conduct of the parties concerned it can be in­ferred that they agreed to the proceed­ings being continued beyond the pe­riod stipulated, then the objection losses all the significance."<br/><br/>10. In view of the aforesaid decision of this Court on the subject the said cited decision reported in <em>6 DLR 641</em> stood overruled and as such there is no force in the submissions of the learned Advocate-on-Record for the petitioners.<br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.  </div></div></div>
