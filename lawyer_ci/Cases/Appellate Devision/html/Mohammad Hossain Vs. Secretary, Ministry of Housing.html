M. Ruhul Amin J. - </strong>This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 23.08.2005 passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 4503 of 2003 dis­charging the Rule.<br/><br/>2. Short facts are that the disputed land, Plot No. 39, Block-A of Firoz Shah Housing Estate Chittagong was allotted to Abu Mohammad Ejahar Hossain on 26.10.1961 and possession was handed over on 03.11.1967. He possessed and a lease deed was also executed in his favour. He died leaving only son the writ petitioner. After the death of the allottee, the writ petitioner went to the Housing and Settlement Office, Chittagong for mutation of his name but the authority refused on the ground that the property was enlisted as abandoned property and published in the Bangladesh Gazette dated 28.04.1996.<br/><br/>3. The respondent No.4 contested the Rule by filing affidavit-in-opposition and controverted the material allega­tions made in the writ petition and fur­ther contended that the disputed plot was allotted to one Abu Mohammad Ezahar Hossain and on 30.01.1962 a registered lease deed was executed between the parties. Md. Hossain has no relationship with Abu Mohammad Ezahar Hossain. He also failed to supply necessary documents in support of his claim. The disputed plot has rightly enlisted as abandoned property. The High Court Division discharged the Rule as aforesaid.<br/><br/>4. We have heard Md. Nazrul Islam Talukder, the learned Advocate who appeared with leave of the Court and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/><br/>5. It is not disputed that the plot in ques­tion was allotted to late Abu Mohammad Ejahar Hossain and lease deed also exe­cuted in his favour. It is also undisputed that the allottee died on 28.12.1979.<br/><br/>6. The writ petitioner's case is that he went to the Settlement Officer, Chittagong on 10.03.2003 to mutate his name after long 23 years of the death of his father. He could not produce any original document namely lease deed and other connected papers before the authority. He also did not approach the Court of Settlement for release of the property from the list of abandoned property.<br/><br/>7. In view of discussions made above, we are of the view that the High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision.<br/>The leave petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
