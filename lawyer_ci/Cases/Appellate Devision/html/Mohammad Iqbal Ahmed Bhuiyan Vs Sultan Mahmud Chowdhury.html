Tafazzul Islam J. - </strong>This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and decree dated 22.3.2004 of the High Court Division passed in First Appeal No.502 of 2001 allowing the appeal preferred against the judgment and decree dated 12.3.2001 of the learned Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge) and Arbitration Court Dhaka passed in Title Suit No. 3 of 2000 by which the suit was decreed.<br/><br/>2. The plaintiff respondent No.1 instituted the above suit seeking declaration that the Memo dated 12.10.1994 cancelling the lease of the suit plot which was allotted to him and the Memo dated 29.10.1994 allotting the suit plot to the defendant No.7 petitioner are illegal, collusive, malafide and those are not binding upon him on the averments that the Ministry of Works, the defendant respondent No.2, established an industrial estate at Mirpur, Dhaka and made many industrial plots therein and therefrom gave allotment of the suit plot measuring 412.33 square yards to him on 14.5.1980 at a premium of Tk.69,581/-; then a lease deed was executed and registered on 4.4.1984 leasing out the above plot to him for 99 years and the possession of the above plot was also delivered to him on that day; after obtaining necessary trade licence and getting his name necessary permission to mortgage the above plot for raising fund the respondent No.1 applied to Janata Bank for loan for establishing an iron and steel industry in the suit plot whereupon Janata Bank sanctioned a loan of Tk.13,00,000/-for the above purpose and by the same he raised sami pucca structures in the suit plot for establishing a factory therein; since the said amount was not sufficient to set up the industry as planned the respondent No.1 requested the above bank for sanctioning Tk.1,50,00,000/-and when the above request for sanction of further loan was under process he suddenly received notice dated 11.9.93 from the office of the defendant/ respondent No.4, to show-cause within 7 days as to why his lease should not be cancelled; he on 26.9.1993 gave reply to the said notice submitting that an iron and steel factory in the name of Mahmud Metal Corporation was set up in the suit plot and the same was already running and then he received Memo dated 12.10.1994 from the defendant-respondent No.4 cancelling his lease and subsequently he also came to know that by Memo dated 29.10.1994 the suit plot was allotted to the petitioner.<br/><br/>3. The defendant Nos. 2-5, the respondent Nos. 2-5 herein, contested the suit by filing joint written statement contending that the suit is not maintainable; the respondent No.1 having failed to set up an industry in the suit plot within two years as stipulated in clause 4 of the lease deed, notices were issued upon him on 11.8.1988 and 11.9.1993 to show cause as to why the lease should not be cancelled; on 26.9.1993 the respondent No.1  showed cause stating that an industry was set up in the suit plot and the same was running but on a survey conducted it was detected that the respondent No.1 did not set tip any industry in the suit plot and accordingly the lease was cancelled by Memo dated 12.10.1994  and then on the basis of the decision of the Ministry of Public Works the suit plot was leased out to the petitioner by Memo dated 29.10.1994 and then the petitioner paying the first instalment on 15.10.1995 claimed delivery of possession and the respondent No.1 having no longer any leasehold right on the suit plot is not entitled to get any relief as prayed for.<br/><br/>4. The defendant No.7, the petitioner herein, by filing a written statement supported the respondent Nos. 2-5.        <br/><br/>5. The trial court, after hearing, dismissed the suit holding that the respondent No.1, having committed breach of the terms and conditions of the lease deed, can not maintain the suit. The respondent No.1 then preferred First Appeal No.502 of 2001 before the High Court Division and after hearing the High Court Division on allowing the appeal decreed the suit.<br/><br/>6. The learned counsel for the defendant No.7/petitioner submitted that the High Court Division erred in law in granting declaratory decree simplicitor when the respondent No.1, in the facts and circumstances was required to seek further relief; the respondent No.1, having committed breach of the terms and conditions of the lease, deed he, by notice dated 11.8.1988 and 11.9.1993, was duly intimated about the breach and was asked to set up an industry in the suit plot according to the terms and conditions of the lease deed, but he failed and accordingly by Memo 12.10.1994 the lease of the suit plot was cancelled and then by Memo dated 29.10.1994 the suit plot was leased to the petitioner; the High Court Division, without reversing the finding of facts of the trial court that the respondent No.1 did not establish any factory on the suit plot in terms and conditions of the lease deed and that the respondent No.1 also failed to prove his case, allowed the appeal in a slipshod and perfunctory manner and the High Court Division also has misinterpreted the scope, object and purpose of section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 causing complete miscarriage of Justice.<br/><br/>7. High Court Division made the Rule absolute holding that in the lease deed the suit plot was described as an industrial one and the plot was leased to the respondent No. 1 for setting up a modern printing press and setting up of such modern printing press not being possible on such a small piece of land measuring 421.33 square yards, the respondent No.1 did set up therein a factory for making small iron and/or steel products and during the pendency of the suit, the Advocate Commissioner, DW.3, found the existence of 4 huts in the suit plot including one 27X27 feet sami-pucca structure and also found that the labourers were working there; the President on behalf of the Republic leased the suit plot to the respondent No.1 for 99 years and as per the Rule of Business, an authorized officer of the respondent No.4 executed and registered the above lease deed on behalf of the President and accordingly within the meaning of section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act 1882. The above lease must be deemed to be in perpetuity and accordingly the above lease could be determined or terminated only by six months notice under the provisions of section 106 of the above Act 1882 and in the above circumstances the respondent No.1 could only be evicted from the suit plot by a suit after due service of notice, but in the present case by the notice dated 11.9.1993 the respondent No.1 was provided merely seven days time before determining/terminating the lease and so the said notice as well as the Memo dated 12.10.94 cancelling on determining/ terminating the lease and giving thirty days notice to vacate the leased premises are not a valid notices within the meaning of section 106 of the Act; further the above memo dated 12.10.94 does not disclose that any enquiry was ever held before the cancellation of lease; though a survey report was submitted from the side of the respondents Nos. 2-5 but the author of the above survey report did not come forward in the suit to support, on oath, his report; the Memo dated 12.10.94 was issued without giving any hearing to the respondent No.1; the respondent No. 5 was also not empowered to cancel a permanent lease by such show of executive fiat; further exhibit Kha showed that there was a Board of Allotment in the Ministry of Public Works comprising of a Joint Secretary and other officials to deal with such government land and on the application of the petitioner dated 25.2.93 the above Board, in its decision dated 8.4.93, allowing the above application decided to allot a five khathas plot to the petitioner and then in consequence Memo dated 29.10.93 was issued by the respondent No.4 allotting the above plot to the petitioner which on the face of it shows that, before issuing Memo dated 11.9.93 regarding the cancellation of the lease of the suit plot, decision was already taken on 8.4.93 to give the above plot to the petitioner which shows absence of good faith and when any action is actuated not by good faith but otherwise, the same must be held to be malafide.<br/><br/>8. We are of the view that the High Court Division on proper consideration of the evidence and materials on record arrived at a correct decision. The learned counsel could not point at, any illegality or infirmity in the decision of the High Court Division so as to call for any interference.<br/><br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
