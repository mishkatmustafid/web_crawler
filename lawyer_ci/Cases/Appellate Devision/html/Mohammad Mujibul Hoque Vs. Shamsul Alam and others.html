Respondent Nos.1 and another institut­ed the case for preemption under section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 for pre-emption of the case land claiming as co-sharers as well as holding land contiguous to the land transferred. Short facts of the pre-emptors are that the case land belonged to Nabin Chandra and Mritunjoy. Mritunjoy died leaving his brother Nabin Chandra and subsequently Nabin Chandra also died leaving him behind four sons namely, Monindra Chandra, Rashik Chandra, Tejendra Lai and Fanindra Lai. Tejendra Lai transferred .081/2 acres of land to one Habibur Rahman by a registered deed dated 22nd April, 1964. Fanindra Lai transferred his .081/2 acres of land to Jayanta Kumar by a registered deed dated 23rd April, 1969. The respondent No.2 Zebal Ahmed Chowdhury purchased the share of Monindra Chandra and Rashik Lai. Jayanta died leaving him behind four sons namely Tushar, Shishir, Samir and Probir who sold their share to the pre-emptors by deed dated 19th August, 1999. Habibur Rahman died leaving one son Mozammel who in turn sold his share to the pre-emp­tors by a deed dated 31st May, 2000. Pre-emptors came to know that the respon­dent No.2 Zebal Ahmed Chowdhury trans­ferred the case land to the respondent No. 1 by a deed dated 6th December, 2003 with­out serving any notice to them and there­after, they instituted the case after obtain­ing the copy of the deed from the local Sub-Registrar Office.<br/><br/>3. The petitioner as well as the respondent No.2, the seller, contested the case by fil­ing two separate written objections. The case of the pre-emptee-petitioner is that the case land belonged to the respondent No.2 Zebal Ahmed Chowdhury who borrowed Taka 1,00,000/- from the pre-emptee-peti­tioner and in pursuance thereof, he entered into an agreement for purchasing the case land and accordingly, the respondent no.2 executed a sale deed in respect of the case land on 6th December, 2003 on condition that the respondent No.1 would reconvey the deed of sale in favour of the respon­dent No.2. The impugned deed is not an out and out sale but it is a deed of mort­gage and therefore, the pre-emption case is not maintainable which is liable to be dis­missed. The respondent no.2 also contest­ed the case by filing a written objection supporting the case of respondent No.1.<br/><br/>4. The learned Assistant Judge on consid­eration of the evidence on record by judg­ment and order dated 2nd May,2005 dis­missed the case holding that the pre-emptor failed to prove that he was a co-sharer or a tenant holding land contiguous to the land transferred and therefore, he was not entitled to pre-empt the case land. The learned Assistant Judge however did not consider the point as to whether the trans­action was an out and out sale or it was a deed of sale followed by a deed of agree­ment for reconveyance.  No point for determination was also formulated on that ground. On appeal by the pre-emptor, the Court of Appeal below by judgment and order dated 27th May, 2006 allowed the appeal and also allowed the preemption case by reversing those of the trial Court. The Court of Appeal below observed that Ext.11 proved that the preemptor was a tenant holding land contiguous to the land transferred, that the pre-emptee was a stranger - purchaser and that the impugned deed was an out and out sale and there­fore, the preemptor was entitled to pre­empt the case land.<br/><br/>5. The pre-emptee-petitioner moved a revi­sion petition before the High Court Division against the judgment and order of the Court of appeal below. A Single Bench of the High Court Division by judgment and order dated 25th January, 2009 discharged the rule and affirmed that of the Court of appeal below.<br/><br/>6. It is contended on behalf of the petition­er that the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division erred in law in main­taining the judgment and order of the lower appellate Court in failing to notice that the transaction in question is not an out and out sale but it is a mortgage and therefore, the case land is not legally pre­-emptible. The learned counsel further argued that the Court of appeal below without properly appreciating the evi­dence of the parties reversed the findings of the trial Court and therefore, the learned Judge of the High Court Division erred in law in maintaining the judgment of the Court of appeal below.<br/><br/>7. As regards the first point as to whether the transaction is an out and out sale or it is a mortgage, though the pre-emptee raised this point in his written objection but he did not press this point at the trial of the case and also failed to adduce suffi­cient evidence in support of this point and accordingly, the trial Court did not give any decision on that point. The Court of appeal below, however, on perusal of the alleged agreement, Ext.1, observed that if the parties really intended to create a deed of mortgage, the agreement ought to have been executed on the date of registration of the sale deed and that after the execu­tion of the sale deed, an unregistered agreement was created by the pre-emptee with a view to defeat the right of preemp­tion. The Court of appeal below therefore held that the transaction is an out and out sale. These findings of the Court of appeal below are based upon proper appreciation of the evidence on record.<br/><br/>8. As observed above, the trial Court did not give any finding with regard to the point as to whether the transaction was an out an out sale or a mortgage and natural­ly the High Court Division while affirm­ing the judgment of the lower appellate Court did not give any finding on this point since the pre-emptee-petitioner did not raise this point in the trial Court possi­bly because there was no legal evidence in support of his claim. As regards the point as to whether the pre-emptor holding land contiguous to the land transferred, the Court of Appeal below considered the doc­umentary evidence on record and found that the preemptor is a tenant holding land contiguous to the land transferred. The learned Judge of the High Court Division also observed that the Court of appeal below on proper consideration of ext. 11 rightly found that the preemptor is a tenant holding land contiguous to the land trans­ferred. These are concurrent findings of fact and the learned counsel has failed to point out any misreading or non-consider­ation of the evidence on record in arriving at such finding. In view of the above, find no merit in the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner. There is no merit in this petition.<br/><br/>The application is dismissed accordingly.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
