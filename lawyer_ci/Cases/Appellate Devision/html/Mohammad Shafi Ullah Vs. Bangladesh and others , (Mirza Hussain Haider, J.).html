As per Recruitment Rules, 1995, although the said respondents No. 5 and 6 had requisite qualifications and became eligible for promotion to the post of Director but the authority did not take any step in that respect. Hence they filed AT Cases No. 48 of 2006 and 49 of 2006 before the Administrative Tribunal for getting promotion with retrospective effect.

But though the petitioner attained the requisite length of service and seniority for being promoted to the post of Director much earlier than those of the said two respondents, his case was not considered by the authority. Hence the petitioner also obtained similar order from the Tribunal, upon coming to know about the favour in respect of the respondents No. 5 and 6, after more than two and half years of his retirement but his case has not been considered.
