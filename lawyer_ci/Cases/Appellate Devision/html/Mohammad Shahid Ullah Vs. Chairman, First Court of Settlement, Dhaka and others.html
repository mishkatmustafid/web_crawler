Abdul Matin J.-</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 22.05.2002 passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 265 of 1997 discharging the rule nisi on contest without any order as to costs.<br/><br/>2. The facts, in short, are that the disputed building was allotted to Syed Nazir Ahmed, son of late Syed Wasi Ahmed on 07.08.1953 as a refugee for his rehabilita­tion by an Indenture of Agreement con­cluded between the then Government of erstwhile East Pakistan on one part and aforesaid original allottee on the other part, vide Annexure 'A'. The aforesaid deed of agreement contained many condi­tions and after allotment of the aforesaid building the delivery of possession of the building was handed over by the Government to the original allottee Syed Nazir Ahmed on 07.08.1953 and after tak­ing over possession Syed Nazir Ahmed had been owning and living in the build­ing with his family member peacefully by paying rents, dues and taxes etc. While the original allottee Syed Nazir Ahmed had been owning and possessing the same sold out the building to the petitioner Mohammad Shahidullah by a registered sale deed dated 16.09.1982 and possession was accordingly delivered to him. Since purchase appellant has been living in the building with his family by paying rents, dues and taxes etc. He also mutated his name after purchase; the property was sur­veyed on many occasions by the Government Officials who noted down the particulars of the house and was satis­fied with the appellant's presence in the house and the relevant documents. The process server of the settlement court came to the aforesaid building on October, 1996 and asked the appellant about to ownership of the building who in reply said that he is the owner of the building. From that date appellant first time came to know that his house was declared as aban­doned property and one Abdul Faraj Molla filed a Case No.132 of 1996 and the prop­erty was enlisted in the "kha" list without sending any notice upon the appellant. The appellant then filed an application for being added as a party in Case No.132 of 1996 which is pending before the Court of Settlement but appellant's application was returned by the Court of Settlement. The appellant then proposed to file a petition under Section 7 of the P.O. No. LIV of 1985 for release of the property but the Court also did not agree to the proposal and advised him to go to the High Court Division as the matter was time barred before the Court of Settlement. The peti­tioner then moved the High Court Division.<br/><br/>3. The respondent Nos.2 and 3 contested the Rule by filing separate affidavits-in-opposition denying the material allega­tions made in the application. The case of the respondent No.2 is that one Syed Nazir Ahmed as refugee was allotted the disput­ed building and while he was in posses­sion of the said building left the house in December 1971 and took shelter in a camp. He also opted for Pakistan (Annexure-I) and as such the question of sale of the house by Syed Nazir Ahmed docs not arise at all and that the appellant has created false and forged documents to grab the property. His further case is that one Abu Faraj Molla (shown as respon­dent No.3 to the writ petition) also had a registered deed of sale dated 18.05.1979 in respect of the disputed house and also claimed the said property. He further alleged that a local survey took place in 1976 and found the house in possession of one Zamsher Ali and he was allotted the house on 21.06.1976 vide Memo No.67/filed U.Ka. She/Dhaka. Mr. Zamsher Ali paid Tk.60/- on 01.12.1976 and had lived therein till his death with his wife. Zamsher Ali had been in possession of the house who sub-let a room to the appellant. Zamsher Ali died in 1981 and his minor children and wife lived in the said house till 1985 when they were ousted by the appellant.<br/><br/>4. The case of the respondent No.3 is that he purchased the property in 1979 by a registered sale deed dated 18.05.1999 and got possession. He also got his name mutated vide mutation Case No.5839 (Mir)/80-81 and paid rent to the Government. Since purchase the respon­dent No.3 had been in possession of the house but in the meantime the property was enlisted in the 'Kha' list of the aban­doned property in Gazette date 22.09.1986 in  Bangladesh Gazette Extra-ordinary published under abandoned building (Supplementary  Provision)  Ordinance, 1985.<br/><br/>5. Being aggrieved the respondent No. 3 filed an application for release of the prop­erty from the list vide Settlement Case No.132 of 1996 pending in the Court of Settlement for disposal.<br/><br/>6. It was submitted on behalf of the appel­lant that in view of the fact that after the emergence of Bangladesh the original Syed Nazir Ahmed opted for Pakistan as evident from annexure-1 to show that the whereabouts of the owner was known and he was present in Bangladesh to manage, control and administer the building in question and as such the land of the origi­nal owner could not be declared as aban­doned property and as such the inclusion of the property in the 'Kha' list of aban­doned building has been done without any lawful authority and the same is of no legal effect and leave was granted to con­sider the submission.<br/><br/>7. We have heard Mr. Mahbubey Alam, learned Counsel and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/><br/>8. Mr. Md. Ali Akand, learned Deputy Attorney General appeared for the respon­dents.<br/><br/>9. It appears that the High Court Division held that the appellant could not prove that Syed Nazir Ahmed the original allottee was possessing the building in question from 1972-1982. The High Court Division further held that the whereabouts of the original allottee was not known and two contesting claimants were claiming the land and building on the basis of their sale deeds each contending the sale deed of other claimant as forged. The High Court Division held that these arc questions of facts and cannot be decided in writ juris­diction.<br/><br/>10. It appears that the appellant could not prove that Syed Nazir Ahmed was holding and possessing the building in question from 1972-82 and therefore, the property became an abandoned property as per operation of law and by discharging the Rule, and the High Court Division has not committed any error of law causing failure of justice.<br/><br/>We find no merit in this appeal and accordingly the appeal is dismissed with­out any order as to cost.<br/>Ed.</div><div style="text-align: center;"> </div></div></div>
