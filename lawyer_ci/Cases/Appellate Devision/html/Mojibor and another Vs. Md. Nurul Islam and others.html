The facts involved in the case, in short, are that the suit land originally belonged to <em>Zamindars</em> Babu Sunil Chandra Ghose, Kiron Chandra Ghose and others and while in khas possession through 3 <em>pattans</em> in 1351, 1352 and 1353 B.S. they gave the land under settlement to Sheikh Wahab Ali after receiving salami and issuing proper <em>dakhilas</em> and said Wahab Ali erect­ed dwelling house over plot No.784 and used to live there with family and in other plots used to cultivate and grow different crops and in this way S.A. and R.S. record were prepared in the name of Wahab Ali; that in the said records his name entered wrongly with the names of superior<em> Zaminders</em>; that Wahab Ali died leaving son Siddiqur Rahman, widow Sajan Bibi and daughter Sahatan who inherited the property and subsequently, the widow and daughter gifted their shares in favour of Siddiqur Rahman through registered instrument and delivered possession; that on 30.03.1985 corresponding to 16th <em>Chaitra </em>1391 B.S. Md. Siddiqur Rahman exchanged the property by registered instrument with the plaintiff and through that deed the plaintiff became owner and possessor of the scheduled land; that in the first part of <em>Falgun,</em> 1387 B.S. the defen­dant No.1 tried to dispossess the plaintiff on the plea of leave taken by him as vest­ed and non-resident property and said Md. Siddiqur Rahman and others filed Title Suit No.106 of 1981 before the Court of <em>Munsif,</em> Manikganj which subsequent­ly, renumbered as Title Suit No.215 of 1984 and on 30.06.1987 the decree was passed declaring the title of Md. Siddiqur Rahman and plaintiff and also declaring that the suit land is not vested and non-res­ident property.<br/><br/>3. The defendants contested the suit by fil­ing written statement denying the materi­als facts contending, <em>inter-alia</em>, that the suit land originally belonged to Ex-land­lords Kiron Chandra and others and he along with his brothers would <em>barga</em> culti­vate the suit land under the landlords and afterwards said landlords proposed to sell the suit land the defendant No.2 agreed to purchase the same and accordingly, they executed 2(two) <em>bainanamas</em> in favour of the defendant No.2 on 31.12.1962 and delivered the possession of the suit land in favour of the defendant No.2, but the deed of transfer could not be registered due to imposition of restrictions on the transfer for land of the Hindu Citizens; that Ex-landlord Shashi Bhusan Sana and others who left for India during the Indo-Pak war in 1965 and accordingly, it was enlisted as the enemy property and thereafter, as vest­ed and non-resident property and that the suit land has been lease out to the defen­dant No.2 vide VP Case No.1/Satu/81/ who has been possessing the same paying lease money to the Government and that all the papers of the plaintiff are false and as such, the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>4. Mr. A. J. Mohammad Ali, learned Counsel, appearing for the petitioners sub­mitted that the trial Court on consideration of evidence on record dismissed the suit in holding that after abolition of <em>Zamindary</em> system the suit property was lying aban­doned and taking that advantage both the plaintiff and contesting defendants are try­ing their best for garbing the suit property with all vague and fraudulent papers; that the plaintiff claimed title by way of regis­tered deed of exchange dated 30.03.1985 with one Md. Siddiqur Rahman who claimed himself as the son of Sheik Wahab Ali and from the pleading of the plaintiff the plaint and the oral evidence of P.W.'s same contradictions appears regard­ing acquisitions of title of Sheikh Wahab Ali by way of<em> pattan</em> from superior<em> Zamindar</em> the High Court Division in absence of proof of chain of title of the plaintiffs predecessor declared title of the plaintiff on the basis of judgment of earli­er suit being Title Suit No.215 of 1984 filed by Md. Siddiqur Rahman and Title Suit No. 106 of 1981 in the Court of the then 1st <em>Munsif</em> Court, Manikganj which was before the registered deed of exchange dated 30.03.1985; that the plain­tiffs predecessor got 3 <em>pattans</em> in 1351, 1352 and 1353 B.S. corresponding to 1944 A.D., 1945 A.D. and 1946 A.D. which was considered by the trial Court as exhitit-1, 1(a) and 1(b) of earlier Title Suit No.215 of 1984 in which the S.A. Khatian numbers were inserted although S.A. operation started after the abolition of <em>Zamindary </em>system and finally published in 1962 A.D. the High Court Division over­looked that in a document of 1944, 1945 and 1946 A.D. the number came in the year 1962 inserted upon fraudulent act and thus, committed error of law in decreeing the suit. The learned Counsel further submitted that upon fraudulent document no declaration of title cannot be declared by a competent Court, the High Court Division erred in law in decreeing the suit without formal proof of exhibit-6 shows 1st party's name Siddiqur Rahman who belonged 'Ka' scheduled property comprising plot Nos. 595, 455, 674 and 707 but exhibit Nos. <em>Kha</em>(7), <em>Kha</em>(4) and <em>Kha</em>(10) show that Nurul Islam was not owner in plot Nos. 155, 455, 495, 707 and 674 and thus plaintiff Nurul Islam was not owner of 16 <em>annas</em> share in 'Kha' schedule property of exhibit No.6 and thus the deed of exchange was executed by giving upon vague schedule of land and the plaintiff did not acquire title over 'Ka' schedule of property of exhibit-6; that the trial Court found the <em>pattans</em> in the name of Sheikh Wahab Ali a forged, fraudulent antedated and further no possession was delivered vide exhibit No.6, the High Court Division nowhere discussed those materi­al evidence but decreed the suit in holding that the plaintiffs title has been declared in earlier suit in which Md. Siddiqur Rahman was plaintiff and thus, the judg­ment is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>5. It appears that the trial Court, the Court of Appeal below and the High Court Division found the plaintiffs title and pos­session in the suit land. The plaintiff has been able to prove his title in the suit land. The plaintiff has also been able to prove that the defendant dispossessed him from the suit land in the last part of Shraban, 1395 B.S. It further appears that the Court below found that the plaintiff was able to prove the alleged fact of dispossession as narrated in the plaint. The witnesses of the plaintiff have also proved the alleged fact of dispossession as narrated in the plaint. The plaintiff has also been able to prove his title to the suit land by adducing reli­able oral and documentary evidence. It also appears that the statements of the defendants are contradictory and as such, not acceptable in the eye of law.<br/>In view of the above, we find no sub­stance in the submissions of the learned Counsel for the petitioners.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
