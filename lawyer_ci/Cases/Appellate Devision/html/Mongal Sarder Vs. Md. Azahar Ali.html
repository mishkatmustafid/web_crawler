Ruhul Amin J.-</strong> This petition for leave to appeal has been filed against the judgment dated March 14, 2005 of a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 2544 of 1993 discharging the Rule obtained against the judgment and decree dated August 22, 1993 of the Court of District Judge, Pabna in Appeal No. 255 of 1987 allowing the same and consequent thereupon dismissing the suit upon reversing the judgment and decree dated September 28, 1987 of the Court of Subordinate Judge, (now Joint District Judge) Pabna in Other Class Suit No. 79 of 1982 decreeing the same on contest against the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 and <em>ex-parte</em> against the rest. The suit was filed seeking declaration of title in respect of 5.43 acres of land out of 6.37 acres of land.<br/><br/>2. The suit was filed stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the land in suit listed in C.S. Khatian No. 141 corresponding to S.A. Khatian No. 301 belonged to Sabjan Nessa, that landlord filed rent suit and the same having been decreed, the land­lord started Rent Execution Case No.180 of 1943 and the land in suit along with the other land was put to auction and the same was purchased by the man­ager of the landlord Sree Jugal Kishore Mazumdar on April 20, 1943 and the sale was confirmed on August 6, 1943, that auction purchaser Jugal Kishore Mazumdar took possession of the auc­tion purchased property on behalf of the landlord, that the landlord settled the 'Ka' schedule land by amalnama along with the other land measuring 17.45 ½  acres of land to the plaintiff No. 28 on 24th Ashar, 1353 B.S., that 51 decimals of land of the suit jote was settled with Mullukjan Nessa, that S. A. record was prepared in the name of plaintiff No. 28 Abdul Majid Mia and Mullukjan Nessa, that defendant Nos. 1 and 2 upon mak­ing untrue statements filed Other Class Suit No. 171 of 1976 seeking declara­tion of title and the defendants of the said suit filed written statement and thereupon the plaintiffs of the said suit withdrew the suit on January 30, 1981, that at the time of R.S. survey defendant Nos.1 and 2 in collusion with the survey officials got attested Khatian prepared in their names and in the middle of the January 1982 the said defendants denied the title of the plaintiffs in the land in suit, hence the suit.<br/><br/>3. The suit was contested by the defen­dant Nos. 1 and 2 by filing written state­ment denying the material averments made in the plaint and stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit is barred by limitation and is also bad for defect of party and that land measuring 6.88 acres belonged to Sabjan Nessa and the S. A. record was prepared in her name, that she died childless leaving her nephews, defen­dant Nos. 1 and 2 and Wazuddin Pramanik and Moezuddin Pramanik as her heirs, that the answering defendants got the share of Wazuddin Pramanik and Moyezuddin Pramanik by amicable par­tition and thus is in possession of the land in suit upon assertion of the right, title and interest and also claiming title adversely against others for more than 12 years, that S. A. record having been wrongly prepared in the name of Abdul Majid (plaintiff No. 28) and Mullukjan Nessa the answering defendants filed a suit for declaration of their title and dur­ing the pendency of the suit S. A. record having been prepared in their names, the answering defendants withdrew the suit, that the plaintiffs filed Case No. 4047 of 1979 before the Settlement Department against the R.S. record and upon hearing the parties the same was dismissed or rejected, that plaintiff No. 28 has creat­ed collusive documents in the name of different persons without any considera­tion with a view to harass the defen­dants, that purchasers from Abdul Majid have not acquired any right, title and interest in the land in suit and they have also no possession in the land in suit and that as the plaintiffs are not in posses­sion of the land in suit, the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>4. The trial Court decreed the suit on the finding that plaintiffs have been able to prove their right, title and possession over the suit property.<br/><br/>5. The contesting defendants went on appeal. The appellate Court allowed the appeal on the finding that Abdul Majid, plaintiff No. 28 from whom plaintiffs purchased the land in suit deposed as P. W. 1 and has stated that he had neither read the plaint nor he 'signed the plaint, that Abdul Majid is claiming .70 acre of land, that from the evidence of P.W. 1 it is seen that at the time of pattan he was a boy of 6 years "and as such it is hard to believe that he took pattan of the suit land" and that he (P.W. 11) admitted "he did not pay any money on the day of pattan", that in the amalnama Ext. 2 "the names of the landlords have not been printed", that there is no evidence that Jugal Kisore Mazumder, the manager was the head employee of the Zamindar and that he had the authority to sign the papers of pattan and that no document had been produced to show that Jugal Kisore Mazumdar was an employee of the landlord, that scribe of the Ext. 3 series (Dakhilas) has not been examined, that plaintiffs failed to prove their possession in the land in suit, that no deed of delivery of possession was filed to establish the case that after auction purchase possession of the auction pur­chase land was taken by the auction pur­chaser or in other words purchase land was taken by the auction purchaser or in other words 'possession was delivered to the auction purchaser, that there is no evidence on record that Jugal Kisore Mozumdar ever collected any rent from Sabjan Nessa Bibi in respect of the land in suit as landlord. Finally the appellate Court held "Since the suit jote was cor­rectly recorded in the name of Sabjan Nessa Bibi, the pre predecessor of defendant Nos.1 and 2, in the C.S. Khatian and since the suit jote has been recorded in favour of defendant Nos.1 and 2 in the R.S. khatian and since there is no cogent evidence on record that the interest of Sabjan Nessa Bibi, the prede­cessor of the defendant Nos. 1 and 2, in the suit jote was legally extinguished and since the alleged pattan in favour of Abdul Mazid and the possession of plaintiffs in the suit have not been proved to the hilt and since the suit is bad for defect of parties, hold that the learned Subordinate Judge was not justi­fied in decreeing the suit and thereupon allowed the appeal.<br/><br/>6. The plaintiffs moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained the Rule. The High Court Division on consideration of the materi­als on record held that from the plain­tiffs side no material was brought on record to show that interest of Sabjan Nessa Bibi in the jote was extinguished in any manner either by auction pur­chase by the landlord or by settlement by the landlord as claimed by the plain­tiffs to Abdul Majid and that the plain­tiffs by reliable evidence also could not prove possession of the land in suit while the suit is for mere declaration of title. On the aforesaid findings the High Court Division discharged the Rule.<br/><br/>7. The learned Counsel for the petition­er could not assail the judgment of the High Court Division and the appellate Court that the same have been passed without non-application of the mind as regard the materials on record and with­out due consideration of the oral evi­dence as well as documentary evidence. On perusal of the judgment of the lower appellate Court we find that the said Court upon detailed discussions of the case of the parties and the evidence brought on record by the parties in sup­port of their respective case disposed of the appeal upon reversing the judgment and decree of the trial Court by which plaintiffs' suit was decreed. It is seen from the judgment of the High Court Division that the said Division consid­ered the materials on record and there­upon arrived at the finding that no mate­rial was brought on record to establish that interest of the C.S. recorded tenant whose heirs are the defendant Nos.1 and 2 was extinguished of in any manner either by auction purchase by the man­ager the landlord or in the manner as claimed by the plaintiffs. It may be men­tioned the suit was filed seeking declara­tion of title claiming possession in the land in suit. The last Court of fact on detailed discussions of the evidence, both oral as well as documentary, arrived at the finding that the plaintiffs failed to prove their possession in the land in suit. The learned Counsel for the petitioners could not point out any mis­reading or non-consideration of the evi­dence by the last Court of fact in arriv­ing at the finding on the question of pos­session of the plaintiffs. The High Court Division on consideration of the materi­als on record did not find any infirmity in the judgment of the Court of appeal below calling for interference.<br/>In the aforestate of the matter we do not find any ground to interfere with the judgment of the High Court Division.<br/><br/>Accordingly the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
