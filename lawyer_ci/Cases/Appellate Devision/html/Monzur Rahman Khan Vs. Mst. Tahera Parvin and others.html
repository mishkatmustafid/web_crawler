Fazlul Haque J.- </strong>This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 29th July, 1993 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 492 of 1986.<br/><br/>2. The appellant as petitioner filed an appli­cation under section 24 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949 being Misc. Case No. 116 of 1982 before the Subordinate Judge, Sirajgonj for pre-emption of two decimals of land. The respondent No. 1 opposed the said petition by filing a written objection. The appellant exam­ined 4 P. Ws. In support of his case whereas the respondent No. 1 examined one witness in sup­port of her case. The learned Subordinate Judge by his judgment and order dated 27.6.86 allowed the pre-emption case. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and order the respon­dent No. 1 preferred Misc. Appeal No. 51 of 1985. The learned District Judge, Sirajgonj by his judgment and order dated 24.8.88 dismissed the appeal. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid decision of the court of appeal below the respondent No. 1 as petitioner filed Civil Revision No. 492 of 1986 before the High Court Division, who by its judgment and order dated 29.7.93 made the Rule absolute.<br/><br/>3. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judg­ment and order dated 29.7.93 the present appel­lant as petitioner filed Civil Petition No. 517 of 1993 and obtained leave to consider whether the alleged Heba deed in favour of plaintiff respondent No. 1 was acted upon and the same was created to defeat the right of pre-emption of the appellant. Secondly, whether the pre-emtee was a co-sharer in the holding otherwise than by purchase, and the pre-emtion proceeding would fail as it sought for a partition of the holding in respect which pre-emtee happened to be co-sharer by heba.<br/><br/>4. Mr. Md. Ozair Farook, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant submits that the said deed of Heba was created for the purpose to defeat the claim of pre-emp­tion and the Heba deed was never acted upon inasmuch as no possession was handed over to the respondent No. 1. The learned Advocate further submits that since Heba deed was not acted upon, the respondent no. 1 was not a co-sharer by inheritance otherwise than purchase. Therefore, the High Court Division acted illegally in making the Ryle absolute and setting aside the judgment and order passed by the lower appellate court. Mr. Md. Ozair Farook, submits that the High Court Division without reversing the concurrent finding of fact illegal­ly made the Rule absolute.<br/><br/>5. There is no doubt that under Mohamadan Law there must be an offer, acceptance and delivery of possession of the property thought to be gifted to constitute valid gift. Let us exam­ine as to whether the mother of the respondent No. 1 had made the valid gift of the land in favour of her daughter, the respondent No. 1. It appears that in support of the gift the husband of the donor as S.W. 1 has categorically stated in chief as well as in cross that the mother of the respondent No. 1 had gifted 1 (one) decimal of land in favour of her daughter, and she (respon­dent No. 1) accepted the offer, and the donor had delivered possession of the land. Therefore, the respondent No. 1 became the co-sharer, other­wise than by purchase. Therefore, in view of section 24(11) (a) of the Act, 1949 the pre-emp­tion is not available; in fact the pre-emption is barred under section 24(11) (a) of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949, which pro­vides that nothing in this section shall apply to a transfer made to a co-sharer in the Tenancy whose existing interest has accrued otherwise than by purchase. It appears that the disputed transfer was by Heba and not by purchase. Therefore, the prayer of the appellant must fail. The pre-emptor appellant failed to prove that the Heba deed was not acted upon. Both the courts below namely, trial court as well as appellate court have wrongly found that the <em>Heba</em> was not completed inasmuch as no pos­session was delivered to the Donee (the respon­dent No. 1). This finding of fact though concur­rent but it is contrary to evidence on record; the perusal of evidence of D.W.1 will shown that the gift was validly made, and the respondent No. 1 became the co-sharer of land otherwise than by purchase and the courts bellow illegal­ly allowed the pre-emption at the instance of the appellant. The High Court Division thought made the Rule absolute but the High Court Division went to a wrong premises inasmuch as that the pre-emption proceeding in the instant case shall fail as the pre-emption was sought for a partition of the holding but the conclusion of the High Court Division is correct inasmuch as the pre-emptee is a co-sharer in the holding oth­erwise than by purchase; <em>Heba </em>though is a transfer but not a transfer by purchase and transfer of a portion of the holding in such man­ner is protected and pre-emption for such trans­fer does not lie against such transferee. Pre­-emption in case of such transfer by Heba is barred under section 24(11) (a) of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949.<br/><br/>6. Considering the facts and circumstance of the case we are of the view that the appellant has failed to prove although that the Heba was not acted upon and/or that the Heba was not complete. <em>Heba</em> was valid as the requirement of <em>Heba </em>was fully complied with. Therefore, we have no hesitation to hold that the pre-emtee became the co-sharer in holding otherwise than by purchase, and preemption is not maintain­able against her and the appeal must fail.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with­out any order as to costs.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
