The defendant No.1 and, Mariam Begum, the defendant No.41, contested the suit by filing separate written statements contending that Kali Ranjan had been in possession of the suit land which had two huts and a condemned building situated at plot No. 3365 and he, by pattan, settled the same to Nafez Ali Laskar, the defendant No.1, and Kashem Ali Munshi, the predecessor of defendant Nos. 2-5, in the first part of Chaitra 1349 BS and put them in possession and Nafez Ali Laskar and Kashem Ali Munshi paid rent for more than 12 years and then on amicable partition Nafez Ali Lasker got southern part of plot No. 3365; since the name of Nafez Ali Laskar and Kashem Ali Munshi were not recorded they filed the above Civil Suit No. 268 of 1971 challenging, the wrong recorded and the summons of the above suit, were duly served upon the defendants of the said suit and the suit was duly decreed on 20-1-72 and then Nafez Ali Laskar mutated his name and then a separate holding was prepared in his name and besides that a municipal holding was also prepared in his name and he also erected new huts after obtaining approval of plan from the municipal authority and then he made a gift of the suit land to his daughter Mariam Begum, the defendant No. 41, by registered deed of heba dated 25-5-1982; the aforesaid Kashem Ali Munshi also made a gift of his portion of the pattani land, described in Ka/Kha schedule to the plaint/ in favour of his daughter, the defendant No. 5, by a registered deed of heba dated 13-11-1983 who exchanged the same suit land with Keshabashan on 9-3-1987 and Keshabashan then sold the same to Khokan Kumar, Kartick Chandra and Tultul Mokherjee, the defendant Nos. 42, 43 and 44 respectively, and they are possessing the suit land and in the said exchange dated document Makhan Lal Chowdhury, member of the then Puja Committee of the plaintiff Bigraha, is an attesting witness; the suit land was released from VP List on 25-6-1984; the defendant No. 9, the daughter of Kali Ranjan, inherited nothing by way of inheritance and she also had no possession in the suit land but defend­ant Nos. 31 and 32 managed to have kabalas from her by way of false representation and then tried to mutate their names but due to objection raised by the defendant Nos. 7-8 they could not be successful and the defendant Nos. 31 and 32 also failed to obtain municipal plan in their favour and the defendant No. 9 also did not put them into possession and the so called solenama between the plaintiff and the defendant Nos. 31-32/42-44 is false and the defendant No. 41 is in possession of her part in assertion of her title and in exclusion of others for more than 12 years and the plaintiff Bigraha had no title and possession in the said land; further the suit, being a suit <em>simpliciter,</em> is barred under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act and the suit is also barred by limitation.<br/><br/>3. The defendant Nos.7-8 contested the suit by filing a joint written statement contend­ing that Boni Madhav, the recorded owner, on 1-2-1944 transferred part of the suit land to the defendant No. 6 and the record of right having not been prepared in his name, the defendant, No. 6 brought Civil Suit No. 94 of 1971 which was decreed on compromise and then the defendant No. 6 mutated his name in SA Khatian and Nidher Kumar Datta, the Pujari and the representative of plaintiff; was fully aware of the same and further on 29-6-1974 the defen­dant No. 6, with the knowledge of Nidher Kumar Datta, transferred the suit land the defendant Nos. 7 and 8 who are possessing their respective portions by mutating their names and on payment of rents and taxes: Subodh Chowdhury Dey, an Advocate of Barisal Bar, got an order of auction sale of the suit land in Execution Case No. 23 of 1973 but the defendants saved the property from auction by depositing decretal amount and then said Sobudh Chowdhury Dey took an attempt to take lease of the suit land from VP Authority in VP Case No.1220/68-69 but these defendants released the suit land on 29-12-1979 from Board of Revenue; the husband of defendant No. 8 transferred .033 acre of land to defendant No. 39 and the plaintiff Bigraha had or has no title and possession in the scheduled land. The defendant Nos. 31, 32 filed written state­ments contending that the plaintiff Bigraha has a temple over suit plot No. 3374 and part of land of plot No. 3365 and the Hindu Commu­nity is using it for the purpose of worshipping and the defendant No. 9, transferred 0.030 acre of land of plot No. 3365 to the defendant Nos. 31 and 32, registered sale deeds dated 6-8-1976 and 13-11-1986 respectively and put them in possession and they are possessing their pur­chased land. The defendant Nos.42 and 44 filed a joint written statement contending that Kali Ranjan dedicated his share in Suit Plot No. 3374 but did not make any dedication of his share in plot Nos. 3364 and 3365 and the defendant No. 9, the daughter of said Kali Ranjan, on mutation of her name in plot Nos. 3364 and 3365 transferred 0.03 acre of land of plot No. 3364 and 0.045 acre of land of plot No. 3365 to Sufia Begum, the defendant No. 5, who purchased the same in benami of her father Abdul Majid Sharif by a registered deed dated 6-8-1976 and subsequently said Abdul Majid Sharif executed a registered Nadabipattra on 13-11-1976 in ; favour of the defendant No. 5 and thereafter defendant No. 5 transferred the same to Keshabashan by a deed of exchange dated 9-3-1987 and Keshabashan transferred the said land to defendant Nos. 42 and 44 by a registered kabala dated 18-11-1987 and 9-10-19.91 and during pendency of the suit, the plaintiff Bigraha and defendant Nos. 31-32/44 filed compromise petition wherein the plaintiff admitted the claim of defendant Nos. 31-32/42 and 44.<br/><br/>4. The learned Senior Assistant Judge, after hearing, having found that the plaintiff Bigraha has the temple over the land of Plot No. 3374 and it has no possession over the part of the land of Plot No. 3365 declared title of plaintiff Bigraha to the land of plot No. 3374 only. On appeal the learned Additional Dis­trict Judge, after hearing, allowed the appeal holding that the defendant No.1 and Kashem Ali Munshi, the predecessor of the defendant Nos. 2 to 5, having obtained the decree by practicing fraud the subsequent transfer of portion of the suit land made by them on the basis of the said decree is illegal and that the solenama between the plaintiff and defendant Nos. 31, 32/42 and 44 declaring title of the plaintiff in the suit land has been duly made and that the earlier judgment and decree passed in Civil Suit Nos. 94 of 1971 as well as 286 of 1997 are illegal and not binding upon the plaintiff and that the plaintiffs are in pos­session of the suit land. As against that the defendant-petitioners moved the High Court Division and obtained Rule in Civil Revision No. 637 of 2002 and after hearing the High Court Division discharged the Rule holding that the appellate Court duly found that the plaintiff Bigraha is in possession of the suit land and further, the claim of alleged pattan by the defendants in the city of Barisal is hit by the provision under section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act and so the contesting defend­ant acquired no pattani right in the suit land on the basis of unregistered document. More­over, the Exhibits showing payment of rent do not show that those were paid in respect of the suit land.<br/><br/>5. We have heard the learned Advocate-on-Record, perused the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and also other connected papers.<br/><br/>6. As it appears, the High Court Division on proper consideration of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision and there is no illegality or infirmity in the above decision so as to call for any interference.<br/><br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
