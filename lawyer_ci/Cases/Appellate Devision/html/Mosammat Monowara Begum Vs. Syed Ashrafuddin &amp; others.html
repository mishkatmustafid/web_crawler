Rahman and Mr. Justice Syed Misbahuddin Hossain</strong>) on 2nd September 1984.<br/><br/>2. Appellant filed Title Suit No. 15 of 1984 in the 1st Court of Subordinate Judge, Barisal for declar­ation of title and confirmation of possession in the suit land. Appellant's case, <em>inter alia</em>, is that property "ka" Schedule land belonged to one Abdul Malek who sold it to Jahanara Begum, predecessor-in-interest of defendant-respondent Nos. 3-13 and respondent Nos. 14-15 in equal shares. Jahanara Begum and respondent Nos. 14 and 15 amicably parti­tioned 195 sahasrangsha out of suit plot Nos. 874 and 875 in three equal parts and Jahanara Begum got '065 sahasrangsha from extreme northern portion and the remaining portion was received by respondent Nos.14 and 15 keeping the land of suit plot No.873 ejmali along with other jointly purchased land. Jaha­nara Begum constructed pucca wall on three sides of her portion and while she had been possessing the suit land peacefully she transferred .065 lands to the appellant by a registered kabala for Tk. 50,000/- on 29th April 1981.<br/><br/>3. Since the purchase the appellant has been possessing the suit land through her tenant after rais­ing dwelling hut and other structures thereon and has mutated her name. She has been paying rents and taxes for the suit land.<br/><br/>4. Appellant has come to learn that respondent Nos. 14 and 15 transferred '144 land from plot Nos. 874 and 875 to respondent Nos. 1 and 2 by kabalas dated 15th June 1978,16th June 1978 and 23rd Sep­tember 1978. They claimed amicable possession in plot Nos. 874 and 875 including the land purchased by the appellant from Jahanara Begum. They insti­tuted Title Suit No. 141 of 1981 in the 1st Court of Subordinate Judge, Barisal for recovery of possession under section 9 of the Specific Relief Act on the al­legations that they have been forcibly dispossessed by the appellant on 29th April 1981. Appellant con­tested by filing written statement but lost the case. A revisional application was filed by the appellant before the High Court Division, Barisal Bench, be­ing Civil Revision No.19 of 1983. The Rule was, however, discharged on 29th November 1983. Re­spondent Nos. 1 and 2 filed Title Execution Case No.3 of 1983 in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Barisal for execution of the decree passed in Title Suit No. 141 of 1981 for eviction of the appellant. Appellant thereafter filed the aforesaid tide suit, namely, Title Suit No.15 of 1984. Appellant also filed an application under Order 39, Rules 1 and 2 and section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure for restraining defendant-respondents Nos. 1 and 2 from prosecuting the Title Execution Case No.3 of 1983 also for evicting the appellant’s monthly tenant and from disturbing the peaceful possession of the tenant till disposal of the suit.<br/><br/>5. Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 contested the appli­cation for temporary injunction by filing written ob­jection. They denied the right, title, interest and pos­session of Jahanara Begum, appellant's vendor, in the suit land. They contended that they had purchased the suit plot Nos. 873, 874 and 875 from respondent Nos. 14 and 15 by registered kabalas and were pos­sessing the same till they were forcibly dispossessed by the appellant on 29th April 1981. After dispos­session- respondent Nos. 1 and 2 filed Title Suit No.141 of 1981 for recovery of possession. They got decree which was confirmed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.19 of 1983. Thereaf­ter they filed Title Execution Case No.3 of 1983 for execution of the decree. Appellant filed Title Suit No.15 of 1984 only to frustrate the decree passed in Title Suit No.141 of 1981. It was asserted by them that as the suit was not maintainable the application for temporary injunction was, therefore, liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>6. By his judgment and order dated 22nd July 1984 the learned Subordinate Judge, Barisal rejected the prayer for temporary injunction. Appellant pre­ferred Miscellaneous Appeal No.94 of 1984 before the District Judge, Barisal. Appellant filed an appli­cation for temporary injunction under Order 39, Rules 1 and 2 and section 151, C.P.C. for restrain­ing respondent Nos. 1 and 2 from executing the de­cree. By his order dated 29th July 1984 the learned District Judge passed an ad interim order of stay till the disposal of the injunction matter. Subsequently, by his order dated 19th August 1984 the learned Dis­trict Judge rejected the prayer for temporary injunc­tion and vacated the order of stay. In doing so he placed reliance on a decision reported in <strong><em>AIR 1955 All. 64</em></strong> holding that temporary injunction cannot be granted against executing a decree passed in a suit under section 9 of the Specific Relief Act.<br/><br/>7. Appellant preferred an application under sec­tion 155 of the Code of Civil Procedure, being Civil Order No.177 of 1984, before the High Court Divi­sion, Barisal Bench. The learned Judges of the High Court Division who heard the application summarily rejected it on 2nd September 1984.<br/><br/>8. Being aggrieved appellant moved this Court and obtained special leave to appeal on 28th October 1984. Terms of special leave are:<br/>"Mr. Khan Saifur Rahman, the learned Counsel, appearing for the petitioner argues that the learned District Judge Rejected the petitioner's prayer for injunction on an erroneous view of law holding that the suit for declaration of title and confirmation of possession is not contem­plated in the back ground of a decree passed un­der section 9 of the Specific Relief Act. He has further argued that the learned District Judge in taking the aforesaid erroneous view relied on the decision reported in <strong><em>AIR 1955 (Allahabad) 64</em></strong>, which was over-ruled by another decision of the said court in the case reported in <strong><em>AIR 1972 (Al­lahabad) 418</em></strong>. The learned Counsel argues that the High Court Division did not apply its judicial mind in considering the point of law raised on behalf of the petitioner and committed an er­ror in summarily rejecting the petitioner."<br/><br/>9. The main contention in this appeal relates to whether the decree obtained by respondent Nos. 1 and 2 in Title Suit No.141 of 1981 which was filed un­der section 9 of the Specific Relief Act is executable. If it is found not executable in view of the appel­lant's application for temporary injunction she is en­titled to succeed, on the other hand if contrary con­clusions are reached as the Courts below Have done, the prayer for temporary injunction restraining re­spondent Nos. 1 and 2 from executing the decree ob­tained by them in the aforesaid suit under section 9 of the Specific Relief Act cannot be granted. Let us consider if a decree obtained in a suit under section 9 of the Specific Relief Act is enforceable or not. To determine this, relevant provisions of law and deci­sions cited by the learned Advocates need considera­tion. Section 9 of the Specific Relief Act provides as follows:<br/>"<strong>9.</strong> If any person is dispossessed without his consent of immovable property otherwise that in due course of law, he or any person claiming through him may, by suit 3 recov­er possession thereof, notwithstanding any other title that may be set up in such suit.<br/>Nothing in this section shall bar any person from suing to establish his title to such proper­ty and to recover possession thereof."<br/><br/>10. A person who has been dispossessed from his immovable property without his consent or ille­gally can institute a suit under the provisions of this section and obtain a decree on proof of his claim to possession of such property. The judgment-debtor in such a case may, if aggrieved, institute a suit to es­tablish his title and on obtaining a decree can recover possession of the property in question.<br/><br/>11. As already mentioned respondent Nos. 1 and 2 obtained a decree for recovery of possession in Title Suit No. 141 of 1981 and put the decree into execution in Title Execution Case No.3 of 1983. The aforesaid suit if may be mentioned, was con­tested by the appellant upto the High Court Division but with no effect. On her failure to get any relief against the decree obtained by respondent Nos. 1 and 2 she filed Title Suit No.15 of 1984 for declaration of title and confirmation of possession and also filed an application for temporary injunction restraining respondent Nos. 1 and 2 from prosecuting the Title Execution No.3 of 1983. From facts so far disclosed, it appears that the appellant's prayer for temporary injunction cannot be granted, the reason being that it would lead to interference with and ultimately frus­trate the order of the Court which was passed in the suit under section 9 of the Specific Relief Act ena­bling respondent Nos. 1 and 2 to recover possession of the land in question. The proposition that respon­dent Nos. 1 and 2 should be restrained by an injunc­tion from recovering possession of the suit land in execution of the decree obtained by them in the suit under section 9 of the Specific Relief Act cannot be accepted also for the following reason as appears from a reading of the judgments in this suit and pro­ceedings arising there from.<br/><br/>12. Though appellant has filed Title Suit No.15 of 1984 for establishing her title to the suit land which she is expressly empowered to do, the question of title to the same was also considered by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 19 of 1983 arising from Title Suit No. 141 of 1981. Find­ings on title to the suit land went against the appel­lant we are not dealing with the question how far those findings would be binding on the appellant in Title Suit No.15 of 1984, but for refusing relief to the appellant in the present case those findings are worth consideration.<br/><br/>13. So far as the decision reported in AIR 1955 All 64 is concerned, the principles laid down therein lend support to fee view that no injunction can be granted to a person against: whom a decree has been passed under section 9 of the Specific Relief Act re­straining the deem-holder from executing the decree, the reason being that if an injunction is granted on the prayer of the judgment-debtor the object and pur­pose of the suit under seem 9 of the Specific Re­lief Act will be frustrated. Section 9 enables a person to recover possession of his land from one who took the law in to his own law into his own hands and forcibly dispossessed him otherwise than in accordance with law. If the judgment-debtor against whom a decree has been passed under section 9 can establish his title in a suit subsequently filed by him, he can no doubt get relief on the basis of his title so found in such suit. In the aforesaid case it was held that the defendant in a suit under section 9 of the Specific Relief Act must first surrender possession to the decree-holder in execution of the decree obtained by him in such a suit. No in­junction can be granted on the plea of title to restrain the execution proceedings, because this tends to de­prive the decree-holder of the fruits of the decree ob­tained by him.<br/><br/>For the reasons stated above, the appeal is dis­missed without any order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
