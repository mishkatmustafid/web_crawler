Short facts are that one Mogol Bibi, an old lady of 90 years, instituted Title Suit No. 38 of 1988 and 39 of 1988 against the present petitioner and others. Both the suits were subsequently renumbered as Title Suit No. 101 of 1991 and 63 of 1992. Her case, in short, is that the suit land originally belonged to Panchanan Ghose who sold the same to one Mendi Mia by kabala deed dated 6th April, 1950. Mendi Mia, while owning and possessing the suit land executed and registered a deed of waqf on 16.02.1953 dedicating the property to the Almighty Allah and Rasul (S.M.) and for the benefit of a Mosque situated at Kader Box Ostagar Lane, Gandaria. The name of the Waqf Estate was Mendi Mia Waqf Estate and Mendi Mia was appointed as first Mutwalli of the said Estate. He transferred 1/3rd share of the land as described in the schedule of the deed of Waqf to his daughter Most. Sahera Khatun on 14th February 1954 and delivered possession. During S.A. operation rest 2/3rd share was recorded as Waqf property. There was stipulation in the Waqf deed that after the death of Waqif Mendi Mia his wife Mogol Bibi would be the Mutwalli of the Estate.  Accordingly, after the death of Mogol Bibi, the plaintiff became Mutwalli of the Waqf Estate. She maintained the property and incurred incidental expenditures of the Mosque. Some of the Monthly tenants of the Waqf properties defaulted in payment of rent. So suit was filed for eviction against those tenants from the Waqf property. She handed over the papers of the suit property to one Zahiruddin, her close relation. A few days after, Zahiruddin taking the plaintiff in an office, took her L.T.Is. in stamp papers saying that those signatures were necessary to file cases for eviction of the tenants. In month of Aswin, 1394 B.S. the plaintiff came to know that Mr. Golam Arshad, Advocate, the husband of the defendant No.1 Sultana Parvin had created kabala deeds in respect of Waqf property. She searched in the respective Sub-Registry Office and got particulars of those deeds. One of the deeds is in the name of Sultana Parvin, the defendant of Title Suit No. 38 of 1988 and another is in the name of Sawkat Ali. Those two kabala deeds are forged and fraudulent and without consideration. On the basis of those kabala deeds, the defendants did not take over the possession of the suit land. The plaintiff has been possessing the suit land on payment of rent and other taxes to the Government. She has been performing the functions of Mutwalli of the Waqf Estate. Hence is the suit.<br/><br/>3. The defendant No.1 of both the suits contested the suits by filing written statements contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suits were not maintainable and were barred by limitation and also barred by the provision of section 42 of the Specific Relief Act as the plaintiff is out of possession. The case of the defendant in both the suits is that the land covering an area of .768 acre of C.S. Plot No. 15 and C.S. Khatian No. 3320 correspon­ding to S.A. Khatian No. 2862 and S.A. Plot Nos. 5150 and 5550 belonged to the plaintiff and S.A. record was prepared in her name. In October, 1981, she expressed her desire to transfer the suit land through Shawkat Ali. Accordingly on receipt of Tk. 20,000/- through cheque. She executed an agreement on 01.11.1981. At the time of such execu­tion, her close relatives were present. Thereafter, on 09.02.1982 she executed the impugned kabala deeds on receipt of the balance consideration money through cheque and in cash. The defendant purchased the said land in her name by one deed and in the benami of Shawkat Ali by another deed. She took delivery of possession of the entire land, after her purchase. After registration of Waqf deed on 16.02.1953 in respect of the suit land and other lands the same was  not  enrolled  as   waqf property, Mendi Mia, the Waqif and first mutwalli of the Estate transferred 1/3rd share of the land to Sahera Khatun, daughter by his divorced wife. After the death of Mendi Mia, Mogol Bibi his second wife became the owner of rest 2/3rd share of the property. The plaintiff filed an application before the Waqf Administrator seeking permission to execute and register fresh deed in favour of defendant No. 1. The Waqf Administrator permitted the plaintiff to transfer the said land after re-fixing the price of the same but the plaintiff without re-fixing the price of the suit land, executed and registered another deed in respect of the suit land in favour of defendant No.1 on 29.05.1984. She also handed over the papers relating to her appointment as Mutwalli to defendant petitioner. The story of taking the signature of the plain­tiff fraudulently is false. One Zahiruddin was appointed as caretaker and licensee in respect of some of the premises but he did not perform his duty as per instruc­tions of the defendant petitioner. So, the petitioner instituted a suit for his evic­tion and got a decree and evicted Zahiruddin through Court on 21.04.1988 and Ansars were deputed to protect her possession. Sahera Khatun and her party men forcibly demolished the boundary wall constructed by the petitioner who filed Criminal Case No. 34(4) 88 which is pending. The plaintiff filed Miscellaneous Case No. 35 of 1988 seeking restoration of possessing of the suit land as per provision of Order 21 Rule 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the suit is dismissed. The petitioner instituted Title Suit No. 18 of 1988 against Waqf Administrator and heirs of Shawkat Ali for permanent injunction and got a decree. The petitioner paid gas bill, electricity bill, rent etc. On prayer of Sahera Khatun the name of Mogol Bibi was deleted and Sahera Khatun was added as plaintiff in the suit.<br/><br/>4. The trial court on consideration of the materials on record dismissed both the suits. On appeal the appellate court allowed both the appeals and set aside the judgment and decree passed by the; trial court and decreed both the suits. The present petitioner then moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained the Rules which after hearing were discharged.<br/><br/>5. We have heard Mr. Khandaker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, the learned Counsel for the petitioner in both the cases and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/><br/>6. It is undisputed that the suit land along with other land belonged to Mendi Mia who executed a registered deed of waqf on 16.02.1953 (Ext. Gha) and he became the first Mutwalli of the Waqf estate and after his death his wife Mdgol Bibi became the Mutwalli of the Estate. It is also not disputed that after the death of Mendi Mia and as per terms of the waqf deed, his wife Mogol Bibi became Mutwalli of the said Waqf Estate and the suit property is within the waqf estate.<br/><br/>7. The defendant's case is that after obtaining permission from the Administrator of Waqfs Mogol Bibi executed and registered the sale deed on 29.05.1984 for the second time in favour of defendant No.1 Sultana Parvin, the present petitioner.<br/><br/>8. The High Court Division on perusal and consideration of the order sheet of the Administrator of Waqfs in E.C. Case No. 16034 observed that on 27.08.1981 Mogol Bibi filed an application before the Waqf Administrator for enrolment of the suit land as waqf estate.  On 17.05.1983, the Administrator of Waqfs finding Mogol Bibi in possession of the suit property enrolled the same and Mogol Bibi was officially appointed as Mutwalli and she sought for permission to transfer the waqf land. The High Court Division further observed that from the order dated 11.10.1983, it appears that the said prayer was rejected by the Administrator of Waqfs. Thereafter, another application dated 25.11.1983 was filed for permission to sell suit land and inquiry was held by Inspector of Waqfs. The Inspector in his report stated that the  Mutwalli had already transferred .384 acres of land by way of gift to Sahera Khatun in 1954 and the Mutwalli before enrolment transferred the rest land to Sultana Parvin and Shawkat Hossain and thereafter filed application for permission to sell the same. The Inspector proposed to cancel the transfer as well as appointment of Mogol Bibi as Mutwalli. Thereafter, Most. Sahera Khatun filed an application for appointing her as Mutwalli. But the Waqf Administrator suggested that her prayer might only be considered after cancellation of her heba deed. The Administrator of Waqfs directed to take action under the provision of section 32 of the Waqf Ordinance. The High Court Division further held that the Administrator of Waqfs did not give any sanction/permission to transfer the suit land (waqf property). The High Court Division held that the statement of the present petitioner that the Waqf Administrator gave permission to transfer the suit land in her favour is not correct. The High Court Division considering a number of decisions, held that a Mutwalli of a Waqf Estate is mere manager and not ostensible owner.<br/><br/>9. Thus it is clear that Mutwalli has no authority to transfer waqf property which has been dedicated to almighty; Allah and as such transfer without legal sanction of the Administrator of Waqfs is invalid transfer and such alienation by the mutwalli has no binding force.<br/><br/>10. The High Court Division further held that Mogol Bibi instituted the present suit on 25.01.1988 not in the capacity of Mutwalli of the waqf Estate but in her private capacity and Mogol Bibi before institution of the suit resigned from the Mutwalliship on 15.08.1987 and the opposite party No.1 was appointed as Mutwalli and was authorized by the Administrator of Waqfs to conduct the present suit, after the death of Mogol Bibi on 19.09.1988, the opposite party No.1 filed an application under Order 1 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure for deleting the name of Mogol Bibi from the category of the plaintiff and for impleading her as plaintiff stating that she has been appointed as Mutwalli of the Waqf Estate. The prayer was allowed on 17.09.1990, impleading Sahera, as the Mutwalli deleting the name of Mogol Bibi. The High Court Division accordingly held that the present suit in fact became a suit instituted by new Mutwalli for cancellation of deeds executed by previous Mutwalli.<br/><br/>11. The High Court Division also held that since the transactions are vitiated by fraud, the suit would be governed by Article 134 of the Limitation Act and the starting point of limitation would be 12 years from the date when the transfer became known to the present plaintiff and the High Court Division also held that the  waqf Administrator and the plaintiff came to know about the impugned deeds in   1983, previous Mutwalli resigned from Mutwalliship in 1987 and died in 1988 and the new Mutwalli was appointed and impleaded in 1988.<br/><br/>12. The High Court Division held that the decree obtained by defendant No.1 in Title   Suit No. 18 of 1988 against Administrator of Waqfs within 20 days from the date of institution and the decree obtained in Title Suit No. 437 of 1984 against her alleged   licensee Jahiruddin within 7 days of institution of the said suit without impleading Mogol Bibi are not at all acceptable as those are attempts to grab the waqf property dedi­cated in the name of Almighty Allah.<br/><br/>13. It is on record that Mogol Bibi was an old lady of 90 years. The High Court Division held that it is the settled princi­ple of law that it is necessary to satisfy the court that she executed the docu­ments with full understanding of execu­tion and of the nature and effect of trans­action and in the instant case the defen­dant No.1 could not adduce any evi­dence to that effect.<br/><br/>14. In the facts and circumstances of the case and in view of the discussion above, we are of the view that the High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision. There is no cogent reason to interfere with the same.<br/><br/>Both the leave petitions are dis­missed.<br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
