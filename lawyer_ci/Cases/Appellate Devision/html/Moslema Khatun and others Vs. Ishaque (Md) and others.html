Afzal J.-</strong>The appellants are defen­dant Nos. 1-4 in Other Suit No. 245 of 1984 of the Court of Assistant Judge, Cox's Bazar. The Suit was filed by plaintiff-respondent No. 2 for declaration of title to and partition of the suit land. On the applica­tion of the appellants, an Advocate Commissioner was appointed for local inspection by order dated. 11.11.86. Respondent No.1 who is defendant No. 5 in the said suit filed an application tinker section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure complaining about certain part of the terms of local inspection. A Sin­gle Judge of the High Court Division, Dhaka heard the matter and by the impugned order dated 11 De­cember 1986 allowed the application without giving the appellants any chance to oppose the same.<br/><br/>2. Leave was granted to consider whether the High Court Division was right in passing the final order without issuing any rule giving opportunity to the appellants to represent their case.<br/><br/>3. It appears that the respondent No.1 com­plained in his revisional application that the local in­spection prayed for, inter alia, as to who had culti­vated the suit land at present, who they were and who had been presently residing there, were matters to be decided upon evidence in Court and could not be a subject-matter of local inspection. The learned Judge of the High Court Division having found substance in the contention deleted only those portions from the points referred to for local inspection.<br/><br/>4. It, however, appears from the copy of the ordersheet of the trial court that the report of the Advocate Commissioner was already before the Court on 30.11.86 which was kept with the record before the impugned order was passed. Evidently this fact was not brought to the notice of the learned Judge and a final order having been passed ex parte on the application of respondent No.1 the learned Judge has not had the occasion to know about the same. It has been held in an earlier decision of this Division that such ex parte final order should not be passed as it violates a principle of natural justice in that the ap­pellants are deprived of any opportunity to represent their case before the order is made; <em>vide</em> <em><strong>A.H. Chowdhury Vs. M. Hossain &amp; ors BCR 1984 (AD) 532.</strong></em> In an other case of <em><strong>Abu Ahmed A. Hafiz &amp; ors Vs. M.A. Hoque Shirajee 1983 BLD (AD) 193</strong></em> such order has been termed as illegal, unfair, unjust and improper and strong disapproval was recorded for disposal of revisional application in this manner. In the present case it has been noticed that respondent No.1 obtained an (impugned) order from the High Court Division which could not have been passed if a rule was issued and the appellants appeared and pointed out that the report of the Advocate Commis­sioner had already been submitted. This only empha­sises the necessity of always hearing the other side before an order touching the rights of the parties is passed. Indeed the learned Judge of the High Court Division will be put to embarrassment if he finds that he passed an order correcting an order of the trial Court which had already been executed.<br/><br/>5. In the circumstances of the case the proper order was to direct respondent No. 1 to file objec­tion, if any, to the Advocate Commissioner's report if he was so advised. It appears from the copy of the ordersheet that defendant Nos. 6 and 8-11 also object­ed to the local inspection but the learned Assistant Judge by his order dated 17.11.86 directed that the objection, would be considered at the time of trial and in the meantime the work of the Commission be completed. Now that the Advocate Commissioner's report was already there, it was all the more neces­sary for defendant No.5 (respondent No.1) to raise his objection against the report in the trial court than lake a revision against the order (terms) appointing the Advocate Commissioner. The trial Court is at liberty to accept or not to accept the Advocate Com­missioner's report or it may accept partly and reject partly or may require parties to adduce evidence on matters which can be decided better on evidence than on such report. If there is a question, particularly of possession of land, the parties are required to give evidence in that behalf and a party can only rely on a report of local inspection to its own peril if the ques­tion of possession is at issue inasmuch as" local inspection' connotes only visual perception and not hearing of witnesses.<br/><br/>6. For the reasons staled above the impugned order is set aside but there will be no order of remand to the High Court Division. The trial Court will consider the Advocate Commissioner's report in the light of objections taken or to be taken by the parties including defendant No. 5. The appeal is accord­ingly disposed of without any order as to Cost.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
