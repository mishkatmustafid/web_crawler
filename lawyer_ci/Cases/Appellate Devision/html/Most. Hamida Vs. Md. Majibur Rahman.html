Aftab Hossain, Advocate-on-record - For the appellant.</em><br/><em>Dr. Rafiqur Rahman, Senior Advocate, instructed by Serajur Rahman, Advocate-on-Record - For the respondent.</em><br/><br/><strong>Civil Appeal No. 21 of 1996.</strong><br/>(From Judgment and Decree dated 17.04.1985 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 842 of 1990)<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Judgment</strong></span><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abu Sayeed Ahammed J.- </strong>At the instance of the plaintiff this appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 17.04.1995 passed by a Single Judge of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 842 of 1990, under section 25 of the Small Cause Courts Act, making the Rule absolute and consequent thereupon setting aside the judgment and decree dated 14.04.90 passed by the Subordinate Judge, 1st Court and S.C.C. Judge, Tangail in S.C.C. Suit No. 2 of 1992 , decreeing the suit for ejectment of monthly tenant.<br/><br/>2. The respondent was inducted in the year 1965 as an ejectable monthly tenant of the appellant in the suit shop room at a monthly rent of Tk. 50/-, which was subsequently raised to Tk. 150/- only.<br/><br/>3. The case of the plaintiff-appellant <em>inter alia</em> is that the respondent was not only a habit­ual defaulter earlier but he also did not pay any rent from the month of Kartick, 1388 B.S. and since" the suit premises was also required bonafide for use of the plaintiff for rebuilding of the same the plaintiff served a notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act upon the tenant on 10.10.82 terminating the monthly tenancy of the defendant with the end of the month of Bhadra, 1389 B.S. requesting the defendant respondent to vacate from the suit shop. But he did not and hence the suit has been filed on the aforesaid two counts; that the defendant was a defaulter and that the premise was required bonafide for use and occupation of the plaintiff after rebuilding of the same.<br/><br/>4. The suit was contested by the tenant respondent by filing a written statement. His case inter alia is that the plaintiff had no cause of action in the suit because the tenant defen­dant had paid a sum of Tk. 5,000/- as security money vide Ext. Ka at the inception of creation of the tenancy on condition that at every month Tk. 25/- would be adjusted towards the month­ly rent from that amount and that still some money out of said paid amount was lying with the plaintiff, therefore the defendant is not a defaulter and that it is not correct that the plaintiff requires the suit premises for her personal use and occupation after rebuilding of the same.<br/><br/>5. Upon hearing the parties, the trial court decreed the suit. Defendant then took the revi­sion before the High Court Division. The High Court Division on contest made the Rule absolute and set aside the judgment and decree of the trial court finding inter alia that the plain­tiff could not prove that the defendant was a defaulter and it was doubtful that the plaintiff bonafide required the suit premises bonafide for rebuilding and thus dismissed the suit.<br/><br/>6. Against that judgment and order of the High Court Division, the leave petition being No. 586 of 1995 was preferred by the plaintiff before the Appellate Division. The Appellate Division upon hearing the plaintiff granted leave to consider that on the face of clear find­ing of the trial court that the defendant was a habitual defaulter and inasmuch as the claim of the plaintiff with regard to bonafide require­ment could be established by the plaintiff appel­lant, whether the Higher Court Division misconceived both the law and the fact in making the Rule absolute and dismissed the case of the plaintiff for ejectment and whether the High Court Division wrongly held that the bonafide requirement of the plaintiff was not proved and the allegation of the default in payment of rent also could not be proved by the plaintiff.<br/><br/>7. Mr. Mahmudul Islam, the learned Counsel appearing for the plaintiff appellant submits that the plaintiff could prove that the defendant did not pay any rent from 1388 B.S. and before that also rent was not paid regularly and this evidence could not be dislodged or dis­proved by the defendant. It is clear that even if according to the deed of agreement creating tenancy Tk. 25/- only would be adjusted towards the monthly rent for every month from the said deposited money, which is said to be the security money still the balance amount of the rent should have been paid by the tenant defendant. But the defendant having not paid any rent from 1388 B.S. It is undeniably proved that the defendant is a defaulter. Mr. Islam also submits that so far the bonfide requirement for personal use and occupation of the suit premis­es after rebuilding is concerned, it is amply proved by the plaintiff vide Ext. 5 series that the plan was obtained by the plaintiff from the local Pourshava authority which was approved by the Subdivisional Officer and was passed by the Chairman of the Pourshava who were the admitted legal authority for the purpose and as such the plaintiff also could prove bonafide requirement of the premises for the purpose rebuilding. Mr. Mahmudul Islam submits that on both these counts that is on the question of default in payment of monthly rent and bonafide requirement the High Court Division misconceived the law and fact in making the Rule absolute and in setting aside the judgment and decree of the trial court who decreed the suit.<br/><br/>8. We hold that either of the said two grounds is sufficient for ejectment of the monthly tenant, as envisaged under section 18(1) (e) of the Premises Rent Control Ordinance. The concept of bonafide require­ment differs from case to case according to the fact and circumstances of each case (<strong><em>42 DLR(AD) 119 and 35 DLR (AD) (388)</em></strong>.<br/><br/>9. Dr. Rafiqur Rahman, the learned Counsel appearing for the respondent tenant, on the other hand, submits that since the amount of money being Tk. 5000/- paid by the defendant to the plaintiff was not exhausted by way of adjustment of Tk. 25/-every month towards the rent as was agreed upon between the parties, although the defendant tenant did not pay any rent, as it is alleged by the plaintiff, he cannot be said to be a defaulter.<br/><br/>10. But from our reading of the provision of sections 18 of the Premises of Rent Control Ordinance it is very much clear that so long an ejectable monthly tenant continues to pa rent of the premises he can not be evicted but when the tenant fails to pay rent, he becomes a defaulter and he can be evicted after serving notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. In the instant case it is very much clear from the materials evidence on record placed before us that it is proved that the tenant is a defaulter since he did not pay any rent after 1388 B.S. and the bonafide requirement of the suit prem­ises was also proved by the Ext. 5 series by the plaintiff-appellant.<br/><br/>11. Dr. Rafiqur Rahman tries to submit that the plan for building was not approved by the authority. But we see that the plan was duly approved by the Sub-divisional Officer and then it was passed by the Chairman of the Pouroshava vide Ext. 5 series which have been proved by the P.Ws. 1, 2 and 3 and this docu­mentary evidence has been over looked by the High Court Division and in that view Dr. Rafiqur Rahman, the learned Counsel for the respondent tenant finds it difficult to deny the bonafide requirement of the landlady. Therefore, both these grounds namely, default and bonafide requirement the plaintiff could prove justifying ejectment of the tenant respon­dent from the suit premises. Mr. Islam relied upon the decision in the case of <strong><em>Mst. Rahman Khatum Vs. Abdur Rashid Bhuiyan and anoth­er</em></strong>, reported in <strong><em>1985 (AD) BLD 77</em></strong>, wherein it has been observed as follows:-<br/>"It shows that on the tenant's appli­cation which is to be made within six months from the date of payment of such deposit the House Rent Controller can order adjustment against rents if the tenant so desires. Such application does not appear to have been made by the respondent. No order, therefore, also exists adjusting the rents of the afore­said months against the security deposit of Tk. 1,000/-. This can not be made now after the plaintiff landlord institut­ed the suit for eviction of the tenants. Whether the security amount of Tk. 1,000/- deposited by the respondents can be considered to be premium, sala­mi, fine or other like imposition or as rent in advance, is a different question, which does not require any decision here. Since no such application under section 14 of the Ordinance was made praying for adjustment against the security money, it is not at all necessary to go into this question."<br/><br/>12. Mr. Islam cites another decision in the case of <strong><em>Md. Ayub Ali vs. Jahanara Shirin,</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>1986 BLD (HCD) P.93, </em></strong>it has been held as follows:<br/>'So, for claiming eviction all that is necessary for the plaintiff to prove is that the suit premises is bonafide required for her own occupation or for any such reasonable cause which is deemed satisfactory by the Court.'<br/><br/>13. In the instant case, the High Court Division erred in law and acted against the evi­dence on record both oral and documentary.<br/><br/>14. We are of the view that the High Court Division has committed illegality in making the Rule absolute and in dismissing the suit.<br/><br/>15. For the reasons and discussions made above, we find merits in this appeal. Accordingly the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division is set aside and the suit for eject­ment is decreed.<br/>No order is made as to costs.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
