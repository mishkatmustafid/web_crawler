This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 24.04.2004 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 4787 of 1997 discharging the Rule.<br/><br/>3. Short facts are that the plaintiffs insti­tuted Partition Suit No. 29 of 1986 in the Court of Munsif (now Assistant Judge), Ghatail, District-Tangail for partition of ejmali property. The suit was decreed ex-parte on 28.09.1989.Thereafter, and the defendant-petitioners filed an application under Order IX Rule XIII of the Code of Civil Procedure to set aside the ex-parte decree. On the ground that summons of the original suit was not served upon the defendant and the plaintiff managed a false report of the process server in respect of service of summons and by practicing fraud upon the Court obtained the ex-parte decree in question on 28.09.1989.The application was registered as Miscellaneous Case No. 57 of 1989.<br/><br/>4.The plaintiff opposite parties entered appearance in the case and filed written objection stating, inter alia, that the sum­mons upon the defendants was  duly served by the process server in presence of Mukabela witnesses and as such the petitioner was aware institution of the suit and he date of ex-parte decree. Both the parties’ adduced evidence in the miscellaneous case and the trial court dismissed the case. On appeal, being miscellaneous Appeal No.16 of 1994, the appellate court upon hearing also dismissed the miscellaneous appeal. Thereafter, the petitioner moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and the High Court division by the impugned judgment and) order discharged the Rule.<br/><br/>5. We have heard Mr. Abul Quasem, the earned Advocate-on-Record for the petitioner and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/><br/>6. It is not disputed that the Partition Suit Mo. 29 of 1986 brought by the plaintiff-respondents in the Court of Munsif (now Assistant Judge), Ghatail, District-Tangail was decreed ex-parte on 28.09.1989. It is also not disputed that Miscellaneous Case No. 51 of 1989 under Order IX Rule XIII of the Code of Civil Procedure was Drought by defendant-petitioners on the ground of non-service of summons and the same was dismissed by the trial court on the ground of limitation and also on the ground that the defendant-Petitioners failed to prove that non service of sum­mons of the original partition suit as alleged by them.<br/><br/>7. It is on record in the process server Afzal Hossain who was examined in the miscellaneous case, in his evidence stated that the summons of the original suit was duly served upon the defendant-petition­ers. It further appears that P.W.1 son of defendant No.4 who deposed in the mis­cellaneous case in his evidence stated that summons of the original suit was duly served upon his father that is defendant No.4 of the suit. The trial court and the appellate court concurrently found that the petitioners had failed to prove that sum­mons of the original suit was not served upon them and accordingly dismissed the case.<br/><br/>8. The High Court Division after assigning cogent reasons affirmed the concurrent findings of the trial court and the appellate court and the present petitioner before the High Court Division could not show any misreading or non-consideration of the material evidence by the courts below.<br/><br/>9. In the circumstances, we do not find any cogent reason to interfere with the judgment of the High Court Division.<br/><br/>10. The leave petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
