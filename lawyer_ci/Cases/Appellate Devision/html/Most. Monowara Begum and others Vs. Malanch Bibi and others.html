With these findings the Appellate Division set aside the judgments of the Courts below in part and sent back the suit on remand to the trial Court for allowing the plaintiff to amend his pleadings by adding the prayer for recovery of possession on payment of proper court fee with a direction that the trial Court shall decide the question of recovery of possession by the plaintiff and the ancillary question of adverse posses­sion of the defendant, if, so raised and also to afford the defendant to file additional written statement.

(4)</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The exercise of revisional jurisdiction is confined to question of jurisdiction. While in a first appeal the Court is free to decide all questions of law and fact which arise in the suit; in exercise of its revision­al jurisdiction the High Court Division is not entitled to reexamine or re-assess the evidence on record and substitute its own findings on facts for those of the subordi­nate Courts. Jurisdiction means "the enti­tlement to enter upon the enquiry in ques­tion." The word is a verbal cast of many colours. The jurisdiction of the High Court Division in revision is a limited one. The section is not directed against conclusions of law or fact in which the question of jurisdiction is not involved. Section 115 empowers to satisfy the High Court Division on matters that (a) the order of the Subordinate Court is within its juris­diction (b) the case is one in which the Court ought to exercise jurisdiction, and (c) in exercise of jurisdiction the Court has not acted illegally, that is, in breach of some provisions of law, or with material irregularity by committing some error of procedure in Course of the trial which is material in that it may have affected the ultimate decision.                                                                              ….

The certificate sale under Sub-Section (3), we have already observed, corresponds to rent decree in some cases, and the purchaser acquired in absolute right in the holding, except the protected interest described in the proviso to the sub-section (3), but with the right to annual the incumbrances in the manner prescribed under the Act. We are not con­cerned with any protected interest here. The defendant, no doubt, claimed an under rayati right by virtue of settlement from Nalini and his wife, the certificate debtors, but his claim is not succeeded." The Appellate Division further observed that "the certificate debtors being the sole tenants, and the plaintiff the sole purchas­er of the certificate sale, he, under S.20(l) of the Act acquired no right, title and interest of the certificate debtors, and in the present case the entire interest of the holding in question, and the holdings so passed in the plaintiff under section 20(3) with right to annual the incumbrances and that the true import of the Section (S.36) is that the sale in a certificate proceeding for non-service of notice under section 7 is valid against whole world for all times, and as against the certificate debtor, after a period of one year, from the date of deliv­ery of property to the purchaser, if no pro­ceeding for setting aside the sale has been started in the mean while."                                                                                               … (15)</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>That the amendment of the plaint is barred by limitation is based on misconception of law, inasmuch as, it is now settled that as to the question of limitation there are two ways in which the same may arise. "First, whether the claim to be included was barred on the date of the institution of the suit. Secondly, whether the claim is barred on the date of the prayer for amendment. On the first case, the prayer for amendment can not be allowed as it is barred on the date of insti­tution of the suit and on the second case, the prayer can be allowed." Reference in this connection is the case of <em>Nurun Nahar V. Mohd. Fazlur Rahman (1979) BSCR 135.</em> In this case the question of limitation does not arise since both the Courts below have concurrently found that the defen­dant has dispossessed the plaintiff during the pendency of the suit. The suit was instituted on 7th March, 1964 and though the amendment of the plaint was made on 19th April, 1977, as soon as the prayer for amendment was allowed, the said amend­ment related back to the date of institution of the suit, as if those statements in the amendment petition were made in the original plaint.

We do not dispute the observations made in the above cases. We fail to understand why the learned counsel has referred those decisions in view of the concurrent find­ings of the Courts below on the point of possession and dispossession. In the case of <em>Abdul Wadud</em> referred by the learned Counsel, the facts are as follows: in the appellate Court, the plaintiffs filed an application for amendment of the plaint stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the defendants no. 9-12 dispossessed them from part of the suit lands during the pendency of the suit. The appellate Court rejected the application on the reasoning that in the application the plaintiffs did not give specific date or month or any specific description of the incident to the alleged dispossession and that the application for amendment was barred by limitation.

Appellant instituted the suit for declara­tion of title to the suit lands and further declaration that the decree passed in Title Suit No.730 of 1962 to be void, fraudu­lent and not binding upon him.<br/><br/>3. Appellant's case in short is that the orig­inal maliks of the holding Nalini and his wife Sarola left this Country for India in 1962 and the suit holding measuring an area of 1.72 acres of land was sold in auc­tion for arrear of rents. The plaintiff auc­tion purchased the same on 22nd October, 1962 in 3 (three) certificate cases and got delivery of possession on 4th December, 1962. The record of right was however not prepared in the name of the plaintiff and it was recorded in the name of defendant on the basis of an <em>ex parte</em> decree passed in Title Suit No.730 of 1962, which clouded his title in the suit lands.<br/><br/>4. Defendant contested the suit contending inter alia that he got settlement of the suit lands in Baishak 1350 B.S. corresponding to 1943 A.D. from Nalini and Sarola on the basis of dakhilas and has since been possessing thereon. The defendant denied the plaintiffs title and claimed that the plaintiff did not acquire any title on the basis of certificate sale and he was not given possession of the suit property.<br/><br/>5. The trial Court on consideration of the evidence on record held that the sale was a nullity; the plaintiff acquired no right in the suit lands on the basis of auction pur­chase and that he was not in possession of the suit property. The lower appellate Court affirmed the finding of the trial Court. The plaintiff took a Second Appeal being Second Appeal No.1114 of 1967 which was also dismissed. Thereafter the plaintiff-appellant preferred Civil Appeal No. 26 of 1975 before this Court. This Court observed that the plaintiff had acquired a valid title in the suit lands by way of auction purchase, and the defen­dant could not challenge by way of defence the validity of the certificate sale on the ground of non-service of notice under section 7 of the Public Demands Recovery Act, that the findings of the Courts below that the defendant had failed to establish his settlement from Nalini and Sarola was correct and that the <em>ex parte</em> decree passed in Title Suit No.730 of 1962 was also fraudulent and void. With these findings the Appellate Division set aside the judgments of the Courts below in part and sent back the suit on remand to the trial Court for allowing the plaintiff to amend his pleadings by adding the prayer for recovery of possession on payment of proper court fee with a direction that the trial Court shall decide the question of recovery of possession by the plaintiff and the ancillary question of adverse posses­sion of the defendant, if, so raised and also to afford the defendant to file additional written statement. The Appellate Division also allowed the parties, if they prayed, to adduce additional evidence and the court thought fit to allow.<br/><br/>6. After the remand the plaintiff amended the plaint and the defendant also filed an additional written statement. The plaintiff thereupon re-examined Golam Hafiz Miah (P.W. 1) and also examined 3 other witness­es in support of recovery of possession. The defendant also examined 3 witnesses in support of his claim of adverse posses­sion. The learned Subordinate Judge thereupon by judgment and order dated 16th June, 1982 decreed the suit declaring plaintiffs title in 'Kha' schedule lands and also declared the <em>ex parte</em> decree passed in Title Suit No.732 of 1962 as fraudulent, void and not binding upon the plaintiff. The trial Court also decreed the suit for recovery of khas possession of the suit lands on removal on the structures thereon. On appeal by the defendant, the Court of appeal below by judgment and order dated 27th May, 1996 affirmed the judgment and decree of the trial Court. The defendant thereupon moved the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 2516 of 1996 and a Single Bench of the High Court Division by judgment and order dated 31st May 2001 and 3rd June, 2001 made the rule absolute and set aside those of the Courts below and dismissed the suit.<br/><br/>7. It was urged on behalf of the plaintiff-appellant that the High Court Division acted illegally in interfering with the con­current findings of fact arrived at by the Courts below that the defendant raised the constructions in 1967 by dispossess­ing the plaintiff, that the plaintiff got pos­session of the suit lands after auction pur­chase, that the defendant's failed to prove the   settlement of the suit lands and that the defendant fraudulently obtained the <em>ex parte</em> decree in title suit No. 730 of 1962. Learned Counsel has referred the cases of <em><strong>Shambhu Nath Poddar Vs. Bangladesh Railway and others 43 DLR (AD) 82</strong></em>, <em><strong>Government of Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary Ministry of Works Vs. Chand Mia and others 44 DLR (AD) 98, Shamser Ali (Md.) and others. Vs. Mosammat Kafizan Bibi, 44 DLR (AD) 231 </strong></em>and <em><strong>Hussain Ahmed Chowdhury@      Ahmed Hossain Chowdhury and others Vs Md. Nurul Amin and others 47 DLR (AD) 162.</strong></em><br/><br/>8. The High Court Division while revers­ing the concurrent findings of the Courts below reassessed the evidence on record as if it were hearing a first appeal. The High Court Division observed that the plaintiff examined PWs. 6, 7 and 8 with­out permission of the trial Court and that the claim of the plaintiff that he was dis­possessed by the defendant on the first part of 1967 was not a believable story. This finding of examination of witnesses without permission of the Court is base­less, inasmuch as, unless the parties prayed for examination of the witnesses, how the trial Court allowed each of the parties to examine 3 witnesses? Examination of witnesses presupposed that on the prayers of the parties, both the parties examined witnesses in support of their respective claims. The High Court Division observed that the plaintiff came out with a new cause of action without disclosing about the exact date of dispos­session and that the Courts below also did not consider some material evidence of D.Ws. 5, 6, and 7 and therefore, the judg­ment of the Court of appeal below is defective as it being based upon misread­ing and non-consideration of the material evidence on record. As regards the obser­vation of non-consideration of the evi­dence of D.Ws.5-7, we find that the learned judge of the High Court Division has not properly appreciated the Judgment of the Courts below. Learned Judge did not point out whose evidence the lower appeal Court misread and non-considered. The Courts below on proper appreciating the evidence on record arrived at the find­ing that the defendant dispossessed the plaintiff during the pendency of the suit. This finding is vague and indefinite.<br/><br/>9. In the application for amendment of the plaint the plaintiff claimed that after filing the appeal in the lower Appellate Court the defendant having realized that he would not get relief in the suit with a view to forestall the appeal raised some constructions in the suit lands taking advantage of the plaintiffs temporary absence in the suit lands in the first part of 1967 and dispossessed him. The trial Court on assessment of the evidence on record came to positive finding that the plaintiff acquire title of the suit lands on the basis of auction purchase on 21st September, 196 that he got delivery of possession on 4t December, 1962, and that the defendant had no possession before, 1962 and he had raised constructions during the pendency of the suit.<br/><br/>10. In view of the averments made in para­graph 9 of the written statement filed on 4th June, 1964 that the defendant con­verted the suit lands into null lands after taking settlement in 1350 B.S., the Court of appeal below disbelieved the defen­dant's claim of possession and observed that this statement of the defendant proved that he did not   raise construction in the suit lands after taking settlement. The Court of appeal below noticed that after the amendment of the plaint, the defendant filed an additional written state­ment on 12th August, 1977 and in para­graph 4  he stated that after the disposal of the suit on 12th September, 1966 he spent over Tk. 50,000/- and constructed a semi pucca house with corrugated sheets on the suit lands and in the western bhiti he constructed another permanent struc­ture by spending  over Tk. 40.,000/- and some other   permanent structures , sani­tary latrine and road at a cost of Tk. 65,000/-. In view of these claim of the defendant, the appellate Court came to the conclusion that the defendant raised the constructions after the disposal of the suit. In arriving  as such conclusion the Court of appeal below also noticed a statement of Khadem Ali (D.W.5) who did not say anything about the construction in the suit lands in his earlier statement but after recall on 20th March, 1980, he stated that the defendant raised construction in 1372 B.S. by spending of Tk. about 3,00,000/-. The lower appellate Court came to a defi­nite finding that the defendant made the constructions during the pendency of the suit and dispossessed the plaintiff.<br/><br/>11. The Court of appeal below also on consideration of the evidence of Golam Hafiz (P.W.1), Mofizuddin Sarder (P.W.2), Ashraf Ali Sarder (P.W.3) and Mohammad Ali (P.W.4) and the documentary evidence filed by the plaintiff held that the plaintiff got possession of the suit lands after auc­tion purchase and that he was dispos­sessed by the defendant in 1967. The Court of appeal below further observed that the defendant failed to prove that he took settlement of the suit lands from Sarala Sundari and Nalini and that the <em>ex parte</em> decree obtained in Title Suit No. 730 of 1962 was fraudulent and collusive and not binding upon the plaintiff. These findings of the Court of appeal below are based upon proper appreciation of the evi­dence on record and these findings of fact can not be disturbed by the High Court Division in exercise of revisional jurisdic­tion in the absence of misreading or non-consideration of the material evidence in arriving at such findings. The learned Judge of the High Court Division totally ignoring that he was hearing the revision petition against the concurrent findings of fact reassessed the evidence and interfered with the concurrent findings of fact.<br/><br/>12. The exercise of revisional jurisdiction is confined to question of jurisdiction. While in a first appeal the Court is free to decide all questions of law and fact which arise in the suit; in exercise of its revision­al jurisdiction the High Court Division is not entitled to reexamine or re-assess the evidence on record and substitute its own findings on facts for those of the subordi­nate Courts. Jurisdiction means "the enti­tlement to enter upon the enquiry in ques­tion." The word is a verbal cast of many colours. The jurisdiction of the High Court Division in revision is a limited one. The section is not directed against conclusions of law or fact in which the question of jurisdiction is not involved. Section 115 empowers to satisfy the High Court Division on matters that (a) the order of the Subordinate Court is within its juris­diction (b) the case is one in which the Court ought to exercise jurisdiction, and (c) in exercise of jurisdiction the Court has not acted illegally, that is, in breach of some provisions of law, or with material irregularity by committing some error of procedure in Course of the trial which is material in that it may have affected the ultimate decision.<br/><br/>13. In the case of <strong><em>Shambhu Nath Poddar</em></strong>, this Court observed that the revisional court acted beyond its' jurisdiction in set­ting aside the concurrent finding of fact, when there is no misreading and mis-appreciation of the evidence on record. In the case of Chand Mia, this Court held- "The lower appellate Court had given a finding that there was no service of sum­mons upon the appellant in that suit. It was no function of the High Court Division to sit in appeal over that finding of the lower appellate Court in the revisional jurisdic­tion." In the case of Hussain Ahmed Chowdhury it was observed that if there is misreading or non-consideration of mate­rial evidence then the High Court Division was within its competence to dispose of the matter on the materials on record.<br/><br/>14. Learned Counsel appearing for the defendant-respondent failed to point out any misreading or non-consideration of the evidence on record by the Courts below in arriving at those findings of fact. It is argued that in the earlier judgment the trial Court had clearly observed that the plaintiff was out of possession till 1966 and this finding was affirmed by the High Court Division in the second appeal, and this concurrent finding having not reversed by the Appellate Division is binding upon the plaintiff. It is further argued that the amendment of the plaint is barred by limitation. According to the Learned counsel, since the suit is for pos­session followed by dispossession, Article 142 of the Limitation Act is attracted and the plaintiff having failed to prove that he was dispossessed after the institution of the suit, the prayer for amendment of the plaint is barred by limitation. In support of his contention he has referred the cases of <em><strong>Abdul Wadud and others vs. Abdul Wahed and others, 14 MLR(AD)106; Ahmed Miaji and others Vs. Eakub Ali Munshi and others 12 DLR 708 </strong></em>and<em><strong> Munshi Dudhu Mia and others Vs Rahimuddin and others 16 DLR 56.</strong></em><br/><br/>15. We find no force in the submissions of the learned counsel in view of the findings of the Appellate Division that "the plain­tiff purchaser acquired a paramount title in the certificate sale. The certificate sale under Sub-Section (3), we have already observed, corresponds to rent decree in some cases, and the purchaser acquired in absolute right in the holding, except the protected interest described in the proviso to the sub-section (3), but with the right to annual the incumbrances in the manner prescribed under the Act. We are not con­cerned with any protected interest here. The defendant, no doubt, claimed an under rayati right by virtue of settlement from Nalini and his wife, the certificate debtors, but his claim is not succeeded." The Appellate Division further observed that "the certificate debtors being the sole tenants, and the plaintiff the sole purchas­er of the certificate sale, he, under S.20(l) of the Act acquired no right, title and interest of the certificate debtors, and in the present case the entire interest of the holding in question, and the holdings so passed in the plaintiff under section 20(3) with right to annual the incumbrances and that the true import of the Section (S.36) is that the sale in a certificate proceeding for non-service of notice under section 7 is valid against whole world for all times, and as against the certificate debtor, after a period of one year, from the date of deliv­ery of property to the purchaser, if no pro­ceeding for setting aside the sale has been started in the mean while."<br/><br/>16. The submission that the amendment of the plaint is barred by limitation is based on misconception of law, inasmuch as, it is now settled that as to the question of limitation there are two ways in which the same may arise. "First, whether the claim to be included was barred on the date of the institution of the suit. Secondly, whether the claim is barred on the date of the prayer for amendment. On the first case, the prayer for amendment can not be allowed as it is barred on the date of insti­tution of the suit and on the second case, the prayer can be allowed." Reference in this connection is the case of <em><strong>Nurun Nahar V. Mohd. Fazlur Rahman (1979) BSCR 135.</strong></em> In this case the question of limitation does not arise since both the Courts below have concurrently found that the defen­dant has dispossessed the plaintiff during the pendency of the suit. The suit was instituted on 7th March, 1964 and though the amendment of the plaint was made on 19th April, 1977, as soon as the prayer for amendment was allowed, the said amend­ment related back to the date of institution of the suit, as if those statements in the amendment petition were made in the original plaint. In that view of the matter the learned Counsel is absolutely wrong in his contention that the amendment is barred by limitation.<br/><br/>17. In the case of <em><strong>Ahmed Miaji</strong></em> referred by the learned counsel, it was observed that "the plaintiffs have set up a case of possession followed by dispossession. They must prove possession within 12 years of the suit. Plaintiffs have failed to prove their case." In the case of <em><strong>Munshi Dudhu Mia</strong></em>, it was observed that "Article 142 of the Limitation Act applies when a plaintiff set up a case of possession fol­lowed by dispossession. In such a case the onus is on the plaintiff to prove that he was in possession within 12 years from the date of the institution of the suit." We do not dispute the observations made in the above cases. We fail to understand why the learned counsel has referred those decisions in view of the concurrent find­ings of the Courts below on the point of possession and dispossession. In the case of <em><strong>Abdul Wadud</strong></em> referred by the learned Counsel, the facts are as follows: in the appellate Court, the plaintiffs filed an application for amendment of the plaint stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the defendants no. 9-12 dispossessed them from part of the suit lands during the pendency of the suit. The appellate Court rejected the application on the reasoning that in the application the plaintiffs did not give specific date or month or any specific description of the incident to the alleged dispossession and that the application for amendment was barred by limitation. This finding has been affirmed by the High Court Division and the Appellate Division maintained the order of the High Court Division. In the facts of the given case, this decision has no manner of application in view of the discussions made earlier.<br/><br/>18. The High Court Division failed to notice that there are limited campus to be resolved in this matter by the Courts below in view of the points formulated by the Appellate Division for decision to the effect that the plaintiff be afforded an opportunity "to amend his pleading by adding the prayer for recovery of posses­sion on payment of proper court fee. The Court shall decide the question of the recovery of possession by the plaintiff, and the ancillary question of adverse pos­session of the defendant, if, so raised."<br/><br/>19. The Courts below accordingly decided the issue in favour of the plaintiff on assessment of the evidence on record, and disbelieved  he defendant's claim of adverse possession on a clear finding that he had failed to substantiate his plea of adverse possession. The High Court Division has exceeded its jurisdiction in interfering with the judgments of the courts below.<br/><br/>The appeal is therefore allowed. The judgment of the High Court Division is set aside and restored those of the Courts below.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
