The plaintiffs’ case, in short, is that the suit property belonged to Haji Moniruddin Sarker.

Haji Moniruddin Sarker accordingly executed and registered three kabala deeds on 21.11.1982 transferring some property in favour of his second wife and her daughter, the plaintiff Nos.1 and 3. That Haji Moniruddin Sarker subsequently obtained signatures of plaintiff Nos.1 and 3 on blank papers on the plea that those would be necessary for other purposes, but subsequently it transpired that Haji Moniruddin Sarker converted the said signed blank papers into a ‘Nadabipatra’ dated 21.11.1982 showing that the plaintiff Nos.1 and 3 relinquished their shares in the property of Haji Moniruddin Sarker. That after the death of Haji Moniruddin Sarker, on 08.04.1988 the plaintiffs filed Succession Case No.55 of 1988 wherein the contesting defendants filed a written statement disclosing about the Wasiyatnama and on inquiry the plaintiffs came to know about the said forged and antedated document which was created after the death of Haji Moniruddin Sarker and thus the plaintiffs have been compelled to file the suit. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The defendant Nos.1 and 3, the first wife and grand son respectively of Haji Moniruddin Sarker contested the suit by filing written statement.

The learned Advocate has argued that the High Court Division though considered the relevant provisions of Mahomedan Law but has failed to interpret the same properly and consequently arrived at a wrong decision; that according to Mohamedan Law a bequest by a Mohamedan to a stranger, i.e., other than his heir, upto one-third of his property remains after payment of his funeral expenses and debts, does not require consent of the heirs of the testator to be valid; that admittedly the defendant No.3 of the original suit namely Md. Abdur Rakib Sarker, one of the present appellants, was not an heir of Haji Moniruddin Sarker at the time of his death since the mother of the defendant No.3, the daughter of Haji Moniruddin Sarker, was alive at that time. The learned Advocate has argued that this very important fact escaped the notice of the learned Judge of the High Court Division in declaring the impugned Wasiyatnama illegal and invalid. The learned Advocate has made submission to the effect also that in this Wasiyatnama Haji Moniruddin Sarker dedicated some money to a Mosque which also is not an heir of Haji Moniruddin Sarker. The learned Advocate has read out also the relevant provisions of Mahomedan Law and has argued that according to these provisions of Mahomedan Law any bequest of any quantum of property to an heir requires consent of other heirs of the testator after his death to be valid, but any bequest to any stranger i.e. not an heir, upto one-third of the surplus of the estate of the testator which remains after payment of his funeral expenses and debts, does not require consent of other heirs to be valid. The learned Advocate has submitted that in this case the defendant No.3 Md. Abdur Rakib Sarker was given much less than the legal one-third of the property of the testator Haji Moniruddin Sarker by this impugned Wasiyatnama and the Mosque also was given some cash money only by this Wasiyatnama which is also much less than the legal one-third of the testator’s property and therefore this impugned Wasiyatnama is valid at least to the extent of the property given to the defendant No.3 and the Mosque. In support of this argument Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud has furnished a written statement of the properties showing the total quantum of the property of the testator Haji Moniruddin Sarker and also the quantum of the properties bequeathed to two wives and 3 daughters of the testator Haji Moniruddin Sarker and also to the defendant No.3 Md. Abdur Rakib Sarker and has argued that this written statement of the properties clearly shows that Md.
