The plaintiff-appellant instituted Other Suit No.55 of 1972 in the Court of the then Munsif at North Raozan, Chittagong against the respondents praying for decla­ration of title and recovery of khas posses­sion of 'Ka' schedule land and also for dec­laration of title and confirmation of pos­session in the 'Kha' schedule land along with other reliefs stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that R.S. Plot Nos.4833 and 4831 originally belonged to Azimuddin Khalifa and both the plots comprised homestead and carti­lage. Azimuddin Khalifa sold the said suit plots along with other lands to one Siddique Ahmed Chowdhury by a regis­tered kabala dated 22.05.1904 vide Exhibit-3 and that Siddique Ahmed Chowdhury obtained possession and pos­sessed for 7 years and then sold to Sarfunnessa by a registered kabala dated 22.03.1911 Exhibit-2(c). But the suit property was mortgaged in favour of one Abdul Hoque by a registered deed of mortgage dated 08.01.1897 by Azimuddin Khalifa. For this the mortgage suit No. 148 of 1926 was filed and the said suit was decreed on 12.09.1928, put the decree into execution and the suit property was sold in auction on 12.02.1931 and the decree-holder purchased the suit property. The sale was confirmed on 25.04.1931 in the name of Tozimul Ali. That one Noor Ahmed claiming through Tozimul Ali filed Other Suit No. 13 of 1966 against the plaintiff-appellant but ultimately that suit was compromised admitting the title and possession of the plaintiff-appellant vide Annexure-'A'. That the defendant No.2 is the wife of defendant No.1 and defendant Nos.3 and 4 are their sons. That they are men of desperate and dangerous in nature and during the war of liberation they with help of Noor Ahmed and local Chairman Abdul Wadud Chowdhury forcibly dis­possessed the 'Ka' schedule land on 15.10.1971 and threatened to dispossess from the 'Kha' schedule land Hence the suit.<br/><br/>3. The defendant-respondent Nos.1 and 2 contested the suit upon filing the written statement by Sona Mia denying the averment of the plaint alleging, inter alia, that the Sarfunnessa, wife of Azimuddin Khaljfa brought Title Suit No. 241 of 1941 against one Hadisur Rahman and others claiming her title in the suit land but she died leaving only brother, Saleh Ahmed and a daughter, Mymuna Khatun and they were substituted in the suit and the suit was decreed. That deceased defendant No.1, Sona Mia was the sister's son of Saleh Ahmed and was reared up from his childhood and so he sold 0.07 acres of land from the Suit Plot No.4833 by a kabala dated 21.11.1945, the R.S. Plot No.4833 by a Kabala dated 21.11.1945. That Saleh Ahmed sold half of the suit land in favour of wife of Noor Ahmed and deceased defendant got the same by pur­chase. The defendant further contended that R.S. Plot No.3571 was acquired by oral gift. Hence, prayed for dismissed of the suit.<br/><br/>4. Leave was granted to consider the sub­mission of the learned Advocate for the leave petitioner that "the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division commit­ted an error of law in discharging the Rule as a whole wherein the respondent did not claim any title and possession in the 'Kha' schedule land therefore, suit should have been partly decreed and the Rule should have been made absolute in part and this important aspect of the case has neither been considered by the Courts below nor by the High Court Division thereby a fail­ure of justice has been caused."<br/><br/>5.   Mr.  Horendra Nath Nandi, learned Advocate, appearing for the appellant sub­mits that the Single Bench of the High Court Division erred in law in not consid­ering that the Court of appeal below failed to consider the documentary evidence exhibit Nos.6 and 7 and the cross exami­nation of the D.W 1 that he erected the structure before 8 years. So, the final Court of fact and the High Court Division did not consider that defendant No. 1 is the sister's son Saleh Ahmed, husband of the plaintiff, Rashida Khatun and the defen­dant No.1 was reared up by Saleh Ahmed; that neither the Court of appeal nor the High Court Division noticed that the defendant No.1 after marriage left the house of the appellant and lived at Dahua and then at Hathazari in the house of his father-in-law and thereafter, during the liberation war in collusion with Noor Ahmed and the Chairman, Abdul Wadud Chowdhury he was forcibly inducted into possession on 15.10.1971 and the suit was filed on 17.05.1972 just after liberation.<br/><br/>6. Lastly, the learned Advocate submits that the Single Judge of the High Court Division should have discussed the evi­dence on record because it is a judgment of reversal, moreover it should have con­sidered the delivery of possession (Exhibit-6) and the sale decree (Exhibit-7) and should have considered that Sal ah Ahmed accepted the sale and has allowed his wife to take hire upon monthly rental and ultimately his wife the appellant was obliged to purchase by sole decree. So, the deed of the respondent is sham and colourable and the evidence of D.W.1 remained uncorroborated and his docu­ment Exhibit-'A' and 'A(1)' has not been proved according to law and that view of evidence on record the appeal is liable to be allowed as a whole by modifying the leave granting order. The learned Advocate further submitted that the defen­dant admitted the possession of the plaintiff in the homestead at R.S. Plot No483T<br/><br/>7. Mr. Abu Siddique, learned Advocate-on-Record, appearing for the respondent Nos.1-2 and 5-10 submits that the so-called auction sale was never acted upon and the auction purchaser never obtained possession or entered into possession. The alleged kabala of the plaintiff claiming purchase of the land in 1958 which is later on point of the kabala of the defendant and thus the plaintiff has not acquired any title inasmuch as the plaintiff has failed to prove possession in 'Ka' schedule land. The defendant, however, admitted posses­sion of the plaintiff in R.S. Plot No. 4831 as the plaintiff’s husband Saleh Ahmed possessed the same on the basis of an oral gift constructing a muddy homestead and that barring the same the plaintiff does not have any possession in the land of R.S. Plot No. 4833.<br/><br/>8. Admittedly the parties have dwelt much regarding R.S. Plot No. 4833 and the Court of Appeal below found that the right, title and possession in schedule 'Ka' but has not disturbed the finding of the trial Court regarding schedule 'Kha'. The learned Advocate as well did not dispute regard­ing possession of the plaintiff in R. S. Plot No.3831 and the Court of Appeal below did not reverse the finding of the regard­ing R.S. Plot No.4831 belonging to plain­tiff while reversing the finding of the trial Court regarding R.S. Plot No. 4833.<br/><br/>9. The learned Advocates as well did not dispute regarding the ground on which decree was issued.<br/><br/>10. We also find substance in the point on which leave was granted. Accordingly, we hold that the plaintiff is entitled to relief in respect of R.S. Plot No.4831 having the homestead therein.<br/><br/>11. In view of the above discussion and reasoning, we find substance in the appeal.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the appeal is allowed in part and dismissed with regard to Plot No. 4833 without any order as to costs.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
