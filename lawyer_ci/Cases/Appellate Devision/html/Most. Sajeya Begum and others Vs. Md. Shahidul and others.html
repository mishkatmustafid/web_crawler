The facts involved in the case, in short, are that the suit property belonged to Bidya Nath Kunda and the said property was put to auction for arrear of rent in Certificate Case No.7(S) 60-61 on 25th July, 1962 and thereafter took possession through Court on 10th March, 1965 and the auction purchaser plaintiff and defen­dant No.3 has been in exclusive enjoy­ment and possession of the suit property and the pro-forma defendant No.3 trans­ferred his interest in favour of the plaintiff and the plaintiff has been in exclusive pos­session of the property by cultivation. The plaintiff who is a simple village folk was in expectation that the land will be record­ed in his name the plaintiff-respondent for the first time in 1378 B.S. equivalent to 1971 came to learn that the suit property has been wrongly recorded in the name of the predecessor of the defendant in <em>khatian</em> No. 181 and 466 and the defendant having threatened dispossession on the basis of wrong record the plaintiff filed the suit for declaration of title and for declara­tion that the khatian in the name of the defendant-petitioner is wrong. In the plaint it was alleged that in a fine in the house of the plaintiff the sale certificate and right of delivery of possession was almost burnt and it was recovered as such.<br/><br/>3. The predecessor of the petitioner con­tested case by filing written statement contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that Certificate Case No. 7(s) 60-61 is fake and Baidya Nath Kunda died long before filing of the alleged certificate in the name of Baidya Nath Kunda is false and Baidya Nath had no interest in the <em>khatain</em> the R.O.R. was wrong and there was delivery of posses­sion on 10.03.1965 is false and the khatian prepared in the name of the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 was correct and the land of C.S. <em>Khatian</em> Nos. 259, 261 was purchased by the landlord and leased out to Mahmud Ali Mondal and two others and as there was arrear of rent of the landlord Fatik Chandra who were the auction purchaser sold to Nirola Bibi and others on 16.03.1939 and the defendants are the pur­chasers from Nirola Bibi by kabala dated 09.09.1957 and their names have been recorded in the name of the defendants and they have been in enjoyment and pos­session.<br/><br/>4. Mr. Abdul Quayum, learned Counsel, appearing for the petitioners submitted that the High Court Division failed to con­sider that the suit was filed alleging pos­session in the suit land through Court hence the decree for <em>khas </em>possession with­out alleging dispossession is a mistake of law occasioning failure of justice. The learned Counsel further submitted that the High Court Division failed to consider that the plaintiff alleging exclusive pos­session in his favour was not entitled to decree for <em>khas</em> possession by mere asking thus, committed error of law occasioning failure of justice.<br/><br/>5. In view of the above, the submissions of the learned Counsel for the petitioners deserve consideration.<br/><br/>6. Accordingly, Leave is granted.<br/><br/>Security of TK. 1000.00 is to be deposit­ed within one month.<br/>The preparation of paper books is dis­pensed with as prayed for.<br/>The operation of the judgment an order dated 25.10.2008 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.6169 of 1991 is stayed till disposal of the appeal.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
