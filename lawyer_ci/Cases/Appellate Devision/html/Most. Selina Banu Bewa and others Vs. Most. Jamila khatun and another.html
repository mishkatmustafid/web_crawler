(6)</strong></div> <br/><strong>Lawyers Involved:</strong><br/><em>Majibar Rahman, Advocate-on-Record-For the petitioners.</em><br/><em>Not represented-the Respondent.</em><br/><br/><strong>Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1341 of 2008.</strong><br/>(From the judgment and order dated 3.3.2008 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Order No.1711 of 2008).<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Judgment</strong></span><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Md. Tafazzul Islam J.-</strong> This petition for leave, at the instance of the defendant/petitioners, is directed against the order dated 3.3.2008 of the High Court Division passed in Civil Order No. 1711 of 2008 summarily dismissing the revisional application filed impugning the judgment and decree dated 17.9.2007 of the learned Joint District Judge, 1st Court, Bogra passed in Other Appeal No.73 of 2002 affirming those of dated 13.2.2002 of the learned Senior Assistant Judge, 1st Court Bogra passed in Other Suit No. 75 of 1991 decreeing the suit.<br/><br/>2. The respondent No.1 filed the above suit seeking cancellation of partition Deed No.77 and also the Deed of Gift No.772 both dated 6.1.1985 registered at the Bogra District Registry on the averments that she is the owner of the suit land by purchase and that the defendant No.1, the predecessors of the present petitioners and the respondent No.2, along with one Abdus Samad, the brother of the defen­dant No.1, came to her house and request­ed her to give ½ decimal of land for the road and she having agreed went to the Registry Office and in good faith executed registered the deed of gift in favour of the petitioners and then on 4.1.1991 the defendant No.1 disclosed to her that the suit land has been partitioned and then on search she came to know about the afore­said deeds which were obtained by practicing fraud inasmuch as she intended to make a gift only ½ decimals of land in favour of defendant Nos. 1 and 2 for road but they, upon practicing fraud, concocted the said deed of partition.<br/><br/>3. The defendant petitioners contested the suit and filed written statement contending that on 6.1.1985 the petitioners and the defendants executed a deed of partition and the plaintiff also executed deed of gift and the defendant No.1 built a <em>pacca</em> house on the land he got by partition and he had been possessing the same and the suit is false.<br/><br/>4. The learned Senior Assistant Judge after hearing decreed the suit and on appeal the learned Joint District Judge, after hearing, dismissed the appeal. The defendants then filed a revisional application and the High Court Division summarily rejected the same.<br/><br/>5. We have heard the learned Advocate-on-Record, perused the records as well as the impugned judgment and order.<br/><br/>6. As it appears the High Court Division rejected the revisional application holding that the plaintiff filed the present suit for cancellation of the deeds on the ground of forgery and although the defendants adduced some witnesses in order to prove the execution and registration of the deeds in question both the Courts below found that the plaintiff was a <em>paradanshin</em> woman and the defendants could not pro­duce any evidence to prove that the said deeds were executed and registered by her with proper independent advise given to her as required under section 16 of the Contract Act and that admittedly the plain­tiff intended to transfer ½ decimal of land for the road in favour of the defendant Nosa.1-2 for the purpose of road and went to the sub-registry office and it was alleged that the defendants created a parti­tion deed along with the said deed of gift and admittedly the plaintiff went to the sub registry office alone and her husband did not accompany her at the sub registry office and the deeds in question were obtained from the plaintiff, a <em>pardanshin</em> illiterate woman and that though the learned advocate for the defendant peti­tioner during hearing drawing the atten­tion of the Court to the deposition of the D.Ws. submitted that by partition more land then she deserved was give to the plaintiff and accordingly the partition deed was not illegal but the present suit, being not a suit for partition, the question of obtaining more or less share of land does not arise at all and the question before the Court is to consider whether the deeds in question was executed by the executants on her good conscious with proper independent advise and consider­ing the evidence on record both the Courts below concurrently found that there was no independent advise to the plaintiffs while executing the deeds in question and further the decisions cited by the learned advocate of the petitioner in respect of section 92 of the Evidence Act has got no manner of application in the instant case inasmuch as the deeds were found to have been executed and registered in the absence of any independent advise and accordingly the provision of section 16 of the Contract Act, being not complied, the deeds were not valid documents in the eye of law.<br/>We are of the view that the High Court Division on proper consideration of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision and accordingly no interference call for.<br/><br/>The petition is dismissed.</div></div></div>
