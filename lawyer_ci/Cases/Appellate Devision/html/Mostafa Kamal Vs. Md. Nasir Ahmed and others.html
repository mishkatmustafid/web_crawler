The facts of the case, in short, are that the plaintiff-respondent Nos.1-3 filed Title Suit No. 53 of 1994 stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that 718 acre of land belonged to Abdul Hakim Hawlader, that there are 4 huts in the said land, that he died leaving three sons, six daughters and two widows. Joygun Bibi one of the widows died leaving son Mojibul Haque Hawlader and three daughters, that Manu Miah one of the sons of Abdul Hakim Hawlader exchanged his share in the Chandina Bhiti (the land in suit) with Mojibul Haque Hawlader, that one of the daughters of Abdul Hakim Hawlader, by name Morjina Khatun insti­tuted Partition Suit No.265 of 1959 in the Court of 1st Munsif and the same was pre­liminarily decreed on compromise and in terms of the preliminary decree Mojibul Haque got .505 acre of land in suit on the northern side with three huts, that Abdul Hakim Hawlader's son Md. Sadek Hawlader got 203 acre of land with the hut on the southern side, that Keramat Ali hus­band of Morjina Khatun (daughter of Abdul Hakim Hawlader) got .090 acre of land, that Sadek sold his share to the extent of .203 acre to the defendant Nos. 1 and 3-7 that while dispute arose between Keramat Ali and the plaintiffs, predeces­sor Mojibul Haque, Mojibul Haque filed a case in the Court of Sub-Divisional Magistrate with a prayer for demarcating his share to the extent of 0.505 acre and that in presence of the parties the surveyor measured the land and demarcated 0.505 acre of land on 2.10.1961 and since then Mojibul Haque and after him the plaintiffs are in possession and enjoyment of the land in suit; that Mojibul Haque inducted tenants in the three huts and the plaintiffs are in possession of the land through the tenants, the defendants, that defendant No.1 upon executing an agreement of ten­ancy for 5 years entered into the hut in holding No.1075 at a monthly rent of Tk.100.00, that defendant having not cleared the rent, a suit, being no.22 of 1975, was filed for realization of rent of Tk. 1200/- and the same was decreed, that the defen­dant went on appeal and the same was allowed, that Mojibul Haque gifted the property in suit to the plaintiffs by a regis­tered heba deed dated 24.07.1979, that defendants obtained order for opening separate khatian in their names for 0.303 acre of land and a khatian was opened in respect of part of the land claimed by the plaintiffs but plaintiffs having had object­ed to that the khatian was cancelled and thereby khatian prepared in the name of the plaintiffs in respect of 0.505 acre of land was maintained, that the defendants upon moving the partition entered into the southern side of holding No.213 and thereby possessing the land and hut of holding Nos.213 and 214, that defendants on 21.12.1991 started repairing of the huts of old holding Nos.213 and 214 (new hold­ing Nos.1075 and 1076) and thereby caused change in the structures which were standing on the said holding, that defendants Nos.3-9 are in collusion with defendant Nos.1 and 2 and the said defen­dants are rendering assistance to the defendant Nos.1 and 2 for unauthorized occupation of the land in suit.<br/><br/>3. The defendant Nos. 1 and 2 contested the suit by filing written statement deny­ing the material averments made in the plaint and stating, <em>inter alia,</em> that Morjina Khatun, daughter of Abdul Hakim Hawlader seeking partition of her ances­tral property filed partition Suit No.265 of 1959 in the 1st Court of Munsif and the suit as compromised amongst the parties. The quantity of land in suit was 0.808 acre, that defendant's predecessor Keramat Ali was the husband of Morjina Khatun, one of the daughters of Abdul Hakim Hawlader, that in the aforesaid par­tition suit plaintiffs, predecessor Mozibul Haque was defendant No.1 and Abdul Hakim Hawlader's son Md. Sadek was defendant No. 2; that Keramat Ali prede­cessor of the present defendants was defendant No.9; that Abdul Hakim Hawlader's daughter Sabeda Khatun was defendant No.8; that in the said partition suit plaintiffs predecessor got 0.505 acre of land; that Sadek Hawlader got 0.203 acre of land and Keramat Ali got 0.1 acre of land; that Sadek sold his share measur­ing 0.203 acre of land to Keramat Ali by the kabala dated 23.11.1960 and thus Keramat Ali acquired 0.303 acre of land; that in respect of the said and present Municipal holdings are 1075 and 1076 and 1079 at one time 213, 217, 216, later on 1176, 1179 and 1180; that to deprive the present defendants, Mojibul Haque predecessor of the plaintiff filed C.R. Case No. 1556 of the 1976 in the Court of Magistrate, Bhola; that Advocate Nasir Uddin, Tarikul Islam and Syed Ahmed were appointed Arbitrator and thereupon an application for with­drawal of the case was filed on 18.04.1977; that signed blank papers were kept in the custody of the Arbitrators and that plaintiffs predecessor collected the signed blank papers from the Arbitrators and manufactured the alleged tenancy agreement, that plaintiffs are enjoying their 0.505 acre of land, the plaintiffs predecessor Mozibul Haque again filed C.R. Case No.1946 of 1977 and the said case was decided against the defendants and thereupon the defendants filed Criminal Appeal No.11(2) of 1980; that plaintiffs predecessor filed suit in the Court of Munsif seeking eviction of the defendants stating that the defendants are his tenants and had defaulted in the pay­ment of rent and the said suit was dis­missed on 30.03.1978; that defendants got the land recorded in Khatian No. 483/1 and paying rent as against that Khatian; that the Keramat Ali died leaving seven sons and a widow, that defendant Nos. 3-5 and 7-9 had gifted their shares on 08.01.1991 to the defendant No.1; that when the defendant No.1 claimed his share to the extent of 0.303 acre of land plaintiff No.1 filed a case under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the Court of Magistrate against the defendants Nos. 1 and 2 thereupon M.P. Case No.28 of 1992 was registered and the same upon hearing the parties was closed by the order dated 23.02.1992; that the plaintiffs have filed the suit making untrue statement.<br/><br/>4. The Assistant Judge, Borhanduddin Upazila heard arguments from both the sides, discussed the evidence and believed that the plaintiffs have been able to prove their case. So, the trial Court decreed the suit for eviction of defendant Nos.1 and 2 from the suit property and for khas posses­sion and also for permanent injunction.<br/><br/>5. Leave was granted to consider the sub­mission of the learned Advocate for the appellant that "both the parties are co-sharers in the land in suit and the Title Suit No.265 of 1959 for partition between the same parties is pending before the learned Assistant Judge, Bhola and as such, the present suit for eviction against some of the co-sharers is not maintainable without the final decree in the said partition suit and as such, the judgment and order of the High Court Division is erroneous and liable to be set aside. The learned Advocate-on-Record also submitted that the High Court Division without consider­ing the law and facts has sent back the case on remand to the trial Court for re­hearing and thus, committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice."<br/><br/>6. It appears from the record that Margina Khatun, one of the daughters of Abdul Hakim Howlader filed Title Suit No.265 of 1959 for partition in the 1st Court of Munsif, Bhola and a solenama was filed in that suit, though in the solenama the suit Khatian was shown as 718 sahasra aungsha, in fact the area of the suit Khatian was 808 sahasra aungsha and the partition was effected on the basis of 808 sahasra aung­sha.<br/><br/>7. It appears that the proceedings in a par­tition suit subsist till passing of the final decree and that before making final decree the preliminary decree for partition on the basis of a solenama being an unstamped memorandum of a partition cannot be admitted in evidence even for any purpose. It appears that an Advocate Commissioner was appointed to submit a report and objection was filed against that report. But the report of Advocate Commissioner was not finally accepted; that the Advocate Commissioner men­tioned the area of the disputed Khatian as 709 sahasra aungsha when the plaintiffs do not admit this area as genuine and the plaintiffs claimed the area as 718 sahasra aungsha and the defendants claimed to be 808 sahasra aungsha. So it is apparent that the exact area of the suit Khatian was not ascertained. When the exact area of the suit property was not ascertained correctly and discrepancy is bound to appear, when the area of the suit Khatian is 718 sahasra aungsha as per exhibit- 1 but according to the report of the Advocate Commissioner the area of the suit Khatian is 709 sahasra aungsha.<br/><br/>8. The High Court Division made the Rule absolute in part directing trial Court to hear on the report of the Advocate Commissioner and the written objection against the report of the Advocate Commissioner for deciding the actual area of the suit Khatian and if the report of the commissioner is found to be acceptable it is to be admitted in evidence. The trial Court of Title Suit No. 265 of 1959 will re­allocate the sahams and shares to the par­ties in the preliminary decree afresh.<br/><br/>9. The High Court Division on through discussion remanded the case to the trial Court for rehearing on the Advocate Commissioner's report for deciding the actual area of the suit khatian and upon considering the report, if lawful, accept the same in evidence. That suit shall not abate for non-substitution of a dead party in appeal. Reference may be had to the case reported and<strong><em> 31 DLR (AD) 320</em></strong> and the trial Court shall allocate the saham of the parties to their respective entitlement. With aforesaid finding, <em>inter alia</em>, the revi­sion was disposed of.<br/><br/>In view of the above, we find no merit in the appeal.<br/>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed without any order as to costs.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
