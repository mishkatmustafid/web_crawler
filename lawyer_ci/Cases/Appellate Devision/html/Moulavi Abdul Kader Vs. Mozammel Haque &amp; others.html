Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1260 of 2004 has been filed by the aforesaid petitioner (the defendant) against the same judgment and order in Civil Revision No.774 of 2002.<br/><br/>3. The petitioner as plaintiff instituted Title Suit No. 97 of 1997 praying for partition of the land of Khatian No. 710 stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that 12 acres of land in C.S. Khatian No. 710 belonged to one Khabir Uddin after whose death his son Mofizul Hoque and two daughters and one wife inherited the property and in view of subsequent transfers Morium Bibi wife of Khabir Uddin inherited 70 decimals of land and that Morium died leaving his son Mofizul to inherits 35 decimals and Bibi Sekantar and Jaynob Banu inherited 17½ decimals each thereby Bibi Sekantar inherited 2.26½ acres of land from her father and 17½ decimals from her mother and while she was in possession of the property, by a deed of gift of 14.03.1973 she trans­ferred 1.78 acres of land to the plaintiff petitioner and through inheritance also he got some land which totalled 2.26½ acres and that the defendants being heirs of Nur Mohammad also inherited por­tion of the properties and the properties being in ejamli possession there being no partition by metes and bounds the plaintiff petitioner prayed partition of 2.26½ acres in his favour.<br/><br/>4. The suit was contested by the defen­dant respondents stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the claim of the plaintiff on the basis of deed of gift purported to have been exe­cuted by Bibi Sekantar is false and in fact the deed was a forged document never acted upon.<br/><br/>5. The learned Assistant Judge decreed the suit by judgment and decree dated 25.04.2000. The defendant preferred Title Appeal No. 67 of 2000 before the learned District Judge, Lakshmipur and the said appeal was heard by the learned Joint District Judge, 2nd Court, Lakshmipur who by the judgment and decree dated 26.11.2001 set aside the judgment and decree passed by the trial court and allowed shah am of 1.05 deci­mals of land in favour of the plaintiff petitioner.<br/><br/>6. The plaintiff petitioner being aggrieved moved the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 1414 of 2002. The learned Single Judge of the High Court Division by the impugned judgment and order discharged the rule.<br/><br/>7. The facts giving rise to Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 1260 of 2004 are that the Respondents Mozammel Haque and others filed Title Suit No. 114 of 1997 against the plaintiff peti­tioner praying to declare the deed of gift dated 14.03.1973 as illegal, void, forged and fraudulent document. The suit was contested by the petitioner filing a writ­ten statement. It was averred that Bibi Sekantar, mother of the petitioner gifted the property in his favour voluntarily and that the suit was liable to be dis­missed.<br/><br/>8. The learned Assistant Judge heard the suit along with Title suit No. 97 of 1997 and   by the same judgment dated 25.04.2000 dismissed the suit (i.e. Other Suit No. 114 of 1992).<br/><br/>9. Being aggrieved the respondent i.e. the defendant of the said suit preferred Title Appeal No. 68 of 2000 and the appeal being heard analogously by the learned Joint District Judge, 2nd Court, Lakshimpur with the aforesaid Title Appeal No. 67 of 2000, the said appel­late court by the same judgment and decree dated 26.11.2001 allowed the appeal, setting aside the judgment and decree of the trial court. The plaintiff being aggrieved moved the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 774 of 2002 and the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division heard the matter analogously and by the impugned judg­ment and order discharged the rule.<br/><br/>10. Being aggrieved by the judgment and order of the High Court Division this petition has been filed.<br/><br/>11. Mr. Md. Nawab Ali, learned Advocate-on-Record in support of the etition has   taken us through the impugned judgment and order and submits, <em>inter alia,</em> that the High Court Division committed error of law in not holding that the plaintiff petitioner's mother transferred the suit property by the executing and registering the deed of gift and as such interference is called for.<br/><br/>12. He further submits that the trial court being court of first instance considered the evidence and decreed Other Suit No. 97 of 1997 and dismissed Other suit No. 114 of 1997 but the lower appellate court with legally adverting to the findings arrived at by the trial court illegally reversed the same and the High Court Division in its turn committed error in affirming the aforesaid illegal judgment of the lower appellate court.<br/><br/>13. Mr. Shamsul Alam, learned Counsel on the other hand opposes the petition submitting, <em>inter alia</em>, that the alleged; deed of gift is said to have been executed in 1973 but the suit was filed in 1997 and during this long period the plaintiff petitioner did not produce the so called deed of gift anywhere nor disclosed the existence of the said deed at any time and thus the said deed did not see the light of the day and that the lower appellate court being the last court of fact considered the evidence and came to the decision that the deed of gift was not a genuine document and as such decided the case correctly. The High Court Division also, according to the learned Advocate, considered the facts and cir­cumstances and evidence on record and correctly affirmed the judgment of the lower appellate court.<br/><br/>14. We have considered the submissions made by the learned Advocates of the parties. It appears that the High Court Division after considering the facts and circumstances and evidence on record came to the finding that the plaintiff petitioner in support of the deed of gift in his favour failed to produce the scribe or any other attesting withness of the deed.<br/><br/>15. It further appears that one Golam Mostafa was produced who deposed as P.W.2. He deposed that they did not see the woman executing the deed of gift only her hands were seen by them at the time of putting thumb impressions nor any witness saw her. The plaintiff claims that P.W.2 Golam Mostafa attest­ed the thumb impressions of Bibi Sekandar before the Sub-registrar but the said witness disowned the claim and deposed that the signature appearing in the document purported to have been made by him is not that of him and his specimen signatures were taken by the trial court which being compared by the lower appellate court as different from those appearing in the deed as identifier of the LTI of the executant. It appears further that in connection with the suit property there was shalish by the local elite and there also the plaintiff did not produce the deed of gift. In the face of such materials we are of the view that production of the document after 24 years for the first time for the present case smells smear.<br/><br/>16. We have perused the judgment of the lower appellate court and it appears that the lower appellate court considered the evidence meticulously and arrived at correct decision. The lower appellate court being the last court of fact and making the findings on the basis of evi­dence on record, the High Court Division did not commit any error in affirming the aforesaid judgment of the lower appellate court. There is therefore no error in the said judgment.<br/><br/>In this view of the matter both the petitions are dismissed.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
