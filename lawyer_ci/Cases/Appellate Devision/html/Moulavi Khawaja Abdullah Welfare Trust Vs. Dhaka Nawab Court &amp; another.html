The High Court Division upon issuing the Rule as to why the delay of 419 days should not be condoned, condoned the delay in filling the appeal after hearing both the parties. The condonation of delay is a matter of discretion of the Court and the Court being satisfied, con­doned the  delay  and made the Rule absolute with cost of Tk. 1000/-.<br/><br/>3. We have heard Mr. Ahsanul Quayum, the learned Advocate appearing with the leave of the Court for the petitioner and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers. We do not find any illegality in the impugned judgment as after hearing the parties, the Court being satisfied made the Rule absolute.<br/><br/>The petition is dismissed.</div>Ed.                       </div></div>
