Tafazzul Islam J.-</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and decree dated 13.11.2007 of the High Court Division passed in Civil Revision No.348 of 1996 discharging the Rule and thereby affirming the judgment and decree dated 6.11.1995 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, 2nd Court, Feni, in Title Appeal (Civil Appeal) No.90 of 1991 allowing the appeal reversing those dated 30.10.1991 passed by the Senior Assistant Judge, Feni, in Title Suit No.11 of 1990 decreeing the suit.<br/><br/>2. Facts, in brief, are that the petitioner, as plaintiffs filed the above suit stating that Rani Harshamukhi Singha, land lady of Bhulua of the Pargan State under Touzi No.5, Noakhali Collectorate, police station Daganbhuiyan District-Feni was in possession of 168 decimal of land under Karimpur Mouza including 50 decimal of land in suit recorded previously in Khatian No.1 of Plot No.4237 under Jagatpur Mouza of the previously District Noakhali at present Feni and while as owner in khas leased out the same to one Nurul Huq Meah and Basirullah by registered kabuliyat dated 25.6.1951, Basirullah gifted his portion of land to his son Oziullah by a heba deed on 6.6.1963. Thereafter Oziullah and said Nurul Huq transferred the suit land to the plaintiff petitioner by a sale deed dated 16.7.1969 and gave possession to them. But during the past MROR survey the suit land was mistakenly recorded in the <em>khas</em> Khatian No.1. The plaintiff-petitioner first came to know about the wrong record of his land on 4.11.1990 when he went to the Tahsil Office for payment of the rent of the land, hence the suit he instituted on 30.1.1990. The defendant government contested the suit by filing a written statement denying the material allegations stating inter alia that the suit is not maintainable in the present from; the suit is barred by limitation and misjoinder of parties. The suit land accreted to the <em>khas</em> land of the land lady, that the suit land was under water for more than 20 years, the suit land recorded under plot Nos.4-37 measuring 50 decimal being the part and parcel of 208 decimal of land was, accreted land from the recess of the river, the land was covered by the river and government is the sole owner and possessor of the land. The predecessor of interest of the plaintiff paid no rent and were not recognized as tenant under the Government. The MROR khatian was correctly recorded in the name of the defendant and as such the suit should be dismissed. The suit land having accreted from recess of the river as addition to the <em>khas</em> land of the previous landlord the plaintiff created some forged deeds and filed the instant suit to grab the suit land. The trial Court after hearing, by judgment and decree dated 30.10.1991 decreed the suit. The defendant then preferred Civil Appeal No. 90 of 1991 before the District Judge, Feni and the learned Subordinate Judge, after hearing, allowed the appeal the petitioner then moved the High Court Division and obtained Rule in Civil Revision No.248 of 1996 and after hearing the High Court Division discharged the Rule.<br/><br/>3. We have heard the learned advocate and perused the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and also other connected papers.<br/><br/>4. As it appears the High Court Division considered the plaint, written statement, the evidence on record and the judgment and decree passed by the learned Assistant Judge    and the impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned Subordinate Judge and the relevant provisions of President's Order No.137 of 1972 and the relevant provision of sections 86 and 87 of the State Acquisition of Tenancy Act and the principle enunciated in the case of <em><strong>A. Mannan and others Vs. Kulada Ranjan Mowali and others 31 DLR (AD) 195.</strong></em> The Appellate Division held that as regards the accretions, which took place after the publication of the notifications under section 3 or section 43(2) of the Act but before the coming into force of part V of the Act, they are also, we have noticed above, beyond the scope of sub­sections (1) and (2) of section 87 and as such the rights which accrued to the riparian owner in respect of such accretions have not been affected in any way by the said provisions of section 87. The use of the word "Malik" shall be deemed to have been substituted for the word <em>rayiat</em> or "tenant". The use of the word <em>"raiyat</em>" or "tenant" in sub-section (2) of section 87 of the Act to denote a person whose right to hold the newly added land as accretion to his holding or tenancy might be recognized or declared by a competent authority or Court before the commencement of President's Order No.137 of 1972. Unmistakably points out that the legislative authority was contemplating a situation in sub­section (1) and sub-section (2) of section 87, which could arise only after the coming into force of part V of the Act in the area in which the accreting lands are situated. The retrospectivity of the provision of sub-section (2) of section 87 of the Act cannot, therefore, be pushed beyond the date of commencement of part V of the Act in the area where the accretion in question had taken place and it is only such accretion which took place after the coming into force of part V of the Act, to which sub-section (1) read with sub-section (2) of section 87, may apply.<br/><br/>5. This provision of law laid down by the Appellate Division cannot be disputed but the facts and circumstances of the instant case is different from those in the cited decision. On going through the plaint and the written statement and the impugned judgment it is evident that the plaintiff failed to prove the title to the ex-landlord that is the riparian owner in respect of the accreted land and no paper or rent receipt have been filed to show that the settlement on the basis of <em>kabuliyat</em> was acted upon and the plaintiff or his predecessor paid any rent to the landlords and  the  original  khatian showing  the ownership and possession of the landlord on the accreted land has not been filed. In this perspective the lower Appellate Court correctly held that the plaintiff failed to prove title to suit land on the basis of accretion of the land to the riparian owner i.e. the ex-landlord.<br/><br/>6. On the other hand it is undisputed from the plaint and written statement that suit land is the accreted char land of chota Feni River and it duly vested to the Government under the President's Order No.137 of 1972. Therefore there is no substance in the contention of the learned advocate that the accreted land has not been affected by the provision of President's Order No. 137 of 1972 and this suit is barred by sub-section (3) of section 87.<br/><br/>7. We are of the view that the High Court Division on proper consideration of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision and there is no illegality or infirmity in the above decision so as to call for any interference.<br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
