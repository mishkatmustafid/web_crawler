Nos. 513, 517 and 518, against the common judgment and order dated 5.12.2007, by which the Rules issued in Civil Revision Nos. 4634/97, 4633/97 and 4635/97 respectively, were disposed of discharging the rules issued calling in question the common judgment and order passed in disposing of three Miscellaneous Cases filed by the same petitioner under section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act for pre-emp­tion of lands sold out by the same vendor opposite party vide three separate sale deeds, duly registered under the Registration Act.<br/><br/>2. The facts relevant for the disposal of the cases in reference are that the opposite party No.2, being owner possessor of the lands described in the second schedule of the Misc. Case Nos. 76 of 1983, 77 of 1983 and 82 of 1983, sold out the same through three separate registered sale deeds dated 26.8.1982, and the consideration for each of the sale was fixed at Tk.1,000/- each, and the sale took place beyond the knowledge of the petitioner and that the petitioner is a recorded tenant of Khatian No.66, in which the case plot belongs, and further lie petitioner is also a co-sharer by pur­chase in the same khatian. The total lands sold vide said three sale deeds was 0.80 acres. The petitioner came to know about the sales definitely after obtaining the cer­tified copy of the sale deeds on 24.1.1983 and 13.1.1983. The plaintiff deposited Tk.1000/- for each case for pre-emption being the deed value plus the compensa­tion, in terms of Section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act.<br/><br/>3. The opposite party No.1, being the pur­chaser of the case land, and the opposite party No.2, being the seller of the case land, entered appearance in all the three Misc Cases being 77/83, 78/83 and 82/83 and contested the same by filing written objections contending, amongst others, that though the transfer of the respective case land were made through. registered sale deeds but in fact the opposite party No.2 gifted the said lands to the opposite party No.1 inasmuch as they are real brothers and that the transfers were made without payment of any consideration money and the transfers were made through registered sale deeds in place of gift deeds on the advice of the scribe to avoid technicalities pointed out by the scribe and that the applicant is the wife of the cousin of the opposite party Nos.1 and 2 and they live in houses constructed side by side arid that the sale deeds were exe­cuted on 26.8.1982, 12.9.1982 and 21.12.1982 and roistered on 26.8.1982. 12.9.1982 and 22.12.1982 respectively and possession of case lands were deliv­ered accordingly. The opposite party No. 1 being away from home, his employee Nur Ahammed Khan accepted the delivery of possession on his behalf, and that the market value of the lands covered by three sale deeds at the relevant time was around Tk.19,000/- but there was no payment of any consideration money against the sales and for the purpose of registration, the total value of the case land, covered by three sale deeds, has been shown at Tk. 3000/-, and that the opposite party No.1, on getting delivery of possession of the suit land invested Tk. 10,000/- in developing the case land in filling up with earth" and that the petitioner herself did not file the pre-emption cases voluntarily but filed the cases at the instance of her sons and that she herself did not deposited the required money in Court.<br/><br/>4. The learned Assistant Judge on consid­eration of the evidences and other materi­als on record and the submissions of learned advocates of the respective con­testing parties dismissed the cases disal­lowing the pre-emption having found three out of five issues framed in the cases in favour of the petitioner in accordance of law. The learned Assistant Judge found that the cases are not barred by limitation and the story of investment by the oppo­site party No.1, after purchase, was not proved and the cases were not bad for defect of parties, but the petitioner failed to prove her intention to preempt the case lands and that the petitioner neither in her pleadings nor in her deposition prayed for decree m respect of the case lands arid thus the issue No.1 being whether the cases as framed and filed are maintainable and the issue No.5, being whether the petitioner is entitled to get order for pre-emption as prayed for, were found against the peti­tioner and hence cases were dismissed.<br/><br/>5. Being aggrieved the petitioner preferred Misc. Appeal Nos. 117 of 1987, 118 of 1987 and 119 of 1987 in the Court of the District Judge, Comilla, which on transfer were heard together and disposed by a single judgment and order dated 2.9.1997 passed by the Additional District Judge, 3rd Court, Comilla, allowing the appeals and setting aside the judgments and orders dated 27.6.1984 of the Court below and allowed the preemptions. The opposite party as respondent No.1 moved the High Court Division against the aforesaid judg­ment and orders passed in T.A. Nos. 117/87, 118/87 and 119/87 in Civil Revision Nos. 4633/97, 4634/97 and 4635/97, wherein the rules were issued and were discharged, after hearing, against which the instant leave petitions have been filed.<br/><br/>6. The High Court Division heard the aforesaid three rules together and disposed of by a single judgment. The High Court Division on consideration of the materials on record and perusal of the judgments of the Courts below and the submissions of the learned Advocates held that the pre-emptor petitioner both in her examination-in-chief and cross examination stated that she filed the cases and paid the money and she wanted pre-emption of the land pos­sessed by the petitioner, being owner through the purchases as aforementioned. The High Court Division further found that the cases were filed within time and that the pre-emptor is a co-sharer in the suit jote and there was no defect of party and that the pre-emptee did not make any development of the case land and that the sale deeds executed by the opposite party No.2 in favour of the opposite party No.1 were not sift deeds but sale deeds. The High Court Division in detail discussed the depositions of the witnesses and quot­ed the relevant portions of the depositions in the body of the judgment and that the allegations that the preemptor is a name lender and her sons actually filed the cases using her name beyond her knowledge have not been proved and found to be false in view of the deposition given by the pre-emptor herself. The High Court Division observed that the trial Court came to erroneous findings since misread the deposition of the pre-emptor. The High Court Division also observed that the story of alleged gift being a question of fact has been concurrently found by the courts below to be not proved by the pre-emptee, and that the High Court Division in its revisional jurisdiction cannot over rule the said finding of fact. Further the learned advocate for the pre-emptee could not point out any misreading of the evi­dences or perverse findings as to said find­ings of fact. The opposite party No.2 sold the land to the opposite party No.1 of the miscellaneous cases beyond the knowl­edge of the pre-emptor.<br/><br/>7. The learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner in the leave petition submitted, amongst others, that the High Court Division did not advert to the depositions of the witnesses of the opposite party in the miscellaneous cases and thereby the impugned judgment and order suffers for non-consideration of evidences on record and that the High Court Division failed to appreciate the oral evidence of the pre-emptor, who deposed as P.W.1, and also misread the evidences on record arid thereby arrived at wrong decision but the learned Advocate could not show from the record as to which part of the deposition of the pre-emptor has not been considered and or misread by the appellate court or by the High Court Division. We have also gone through the depositions of the pre-emptor and found that both in the exami­nation-in-chief as well as in the cross-examination the preemptor, an aged women of about 80 years, has stated that she filed the suit for pre-emption of the land possessed by the opposite party No.1 of the miscellaneous cases and that she deposited the money for each of the cases and that the objection raised to the effect that at the bottom of the plaints of two miscellaneous cases the thumb impression of the pre-emptor has not been put in and it is on record that the pre-emptor has died in the meantime, and as such the irregular­ities as alleged could not be rectified but the pre-emptor petitioner having deposed before the Court herself such irregularity can not stand as a bar for the disposal of the cases on merit. Now putting of thumb impression or signature at the verification is an irregularity and not an illegality and the same could be corrected. Such verifi­cation is for the purpose of confirming that the statements made in the plaint are of the plaintiff/petitioner. In the instant case the petitioner having deposed in Court supporting the statements made in the respective plaints, which is in fact treated as evidences, the irregularity as aforementioned, not regularised, as the petitioner died in the meantime, cannot stand as a bar in the passing of favourable order in favour of the pre-emptor duly substituted in accordance with law. It also appears that the Courts below have found that the cases were filed in time and there was no defect of party as alleged and the story of gift alleged by the pre-emptee could not be proved and .that the pre-emptee did not make any development in the case land by filling earth.<br/><br/>8. In the facts and circumstances and observations made herein above, we do not find any illegality in the impugned judgment and order passed in the revision-al cases and as such no interference called for in the impugned judgments.<br/><br/>Accordingly, all the applications for leave to appeal being CPLA Nos. 513, 517 and 518 of 2008 are dismissed.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
