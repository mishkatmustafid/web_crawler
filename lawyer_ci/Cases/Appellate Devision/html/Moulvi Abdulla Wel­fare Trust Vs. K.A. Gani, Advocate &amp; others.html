The appellant Abdullah Welfare Trust got a decree against the Dhaka Nowab Court of Wards Estate on compromise in Title Suit No. 130 of 1957. The appellant started execution case for enforcement of the said decree and applied for delivery of possession of the decretal properties pen­ding registration of the deeds by the judgment debtor but that was rejected by the Execu­ting Court and the Executing Court appointed respondent No. 1 K. A. Gani as receiver of the properties. The receiver, it appears with court's permission started constructing a commercial building consisting of shop-rooms in the ground-floor in the land of Schedule A of the compromise decree but as he failed to render accounts of expenditures for the construction and of salami and rents received by way of disposal of the shop-rooms the Executing Court by its order No. 265 dated 6.5.76 observed: <br/>"Seen the accounts submitted by the receiver. I am not satisfied with the account. Apparently it transpires that the receiver appointed some persons for seeing the works without taking prior permission of the Court and he should pay out of salary against these persons. It is illegal Moreover it is apparent chat &amp; huge work of market construction investing several lacs has been taken up by the Receiver and in this respect a thorough supervision, maintenance of proper accounts, etc. are necessary." <br/>Thereafter the Executing Court appointed a joint receiver who however, could not perform his function as he died immediately thereafter. In the meantime a contractor pressed for his bill and by order No. 272 dated 25.5.76 the Court refused the prayer of the Contractor by observing: <br/>“This is a matter between the Recei­ver and contractor appointed by the Receiver. So Court will not entertain this petition. Receiver and the contrac­tor should settle the matter between themselves". <br/>The contractor, however, moved the High Court Division in C.R. No. 840 of 1976. A Division Bench disposed of the matter by observing that the contractor's claim is to be Inquired into and finalized by the Court and he should not be prejudiced if a bank guarantee to the tune of Tk. 3,50,000/- is fur­nished by the decree-holder and the Court passed the following direction: <br/>"It is accordingly directed that the learned Subordinate Judge should effect the delivery of possession of the pro­perties in question to the decree-holders, only after the decree-holders have fur­nished a bank guarantee to the tune of Tk. 3,50,000/-. It is further directed that the learned Subordinate Judge shall hear the application filed before him en 10.6.76 by the decree-holder on its merit after he has afforded opportunity to the parties concerned to represent before him". <br/>Thereafter numerous attempts were made by the decree-holder to secure the delivery of possession but to no avail and the decree holder filed number of petitions before the Executing Court to stop payment to the recei­ver. On 29.9.80 the receiver submitted bills and for passing accounts for the period 1976 to 1980 whereupon on 26.11.80 the decree-holder filed written objection to the passing of the accounts submitted by the receiver. The Executing Court, however, heard the petition of the decree-holder for delivery of possession and passed the order No. 430 dated 9.5.81 which is the impugned order. The Executing Court considered the conten­tion of the decree-holder that the High Court Division had already passed an order in C.R. No. 840 of 1976 dated 3.8.76 directing the court to deliver the possession of the property to the decree-holder. The Executing Court, however, took the view that the deci­sion of the High Court Division should be implemented by furnishing a bank guarantee for Tk. 3,50,000/- but the receiver "should also get at least his part bill money besides the Bank guarantee to be furnished by the Board of Trustees which they are willing to furnish now. Further it appears from the record that a sum of Taka 7,78,792/- was found to be payable to the receiver vide court's order No. 321 dated 29.1.77. This amount also as record speaks remains unpaid". The Exe­cuting Court, however, noticed the challenge that was giver to the receiver's action as being unauthorized and without approval of the Court. The Court took the view that the Sheristadar had checked the account and a total sum of Tk. 43,34,011/02 was recom­mended for passing but the Court disallowed the expenditure towards entertainment and conveyance and fixed amount at Tk. 41,12,365/23 as the expenditure of the cons­truction work undertaken by the receiver.<br/>In this circumstances the Executing Court passed the following order: <br/>"That the receiver do make over possession of the Trust properties to the D. Hrs. through their Chairman at once subject to furnishing the Bank Guarantee of Tk. 3,50,000/- as per order of the Hon'ble High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh and also payment of the amount of Tk. 7,78,692/- towards the outstanding bills of the Receiver pursuant to the Court's order dated 29.1.77. It is further ordered that the D. Hrs. do furnish an in­demnity Bond as well as Bank Guarantee in respect of the Receiver's balance bill money amounting to Tk. 41,12,365/27 within 60 days from date". <br/><br/>3. This order was challenged before the District Judge by way of revision. The learned District took the view that the recei­ver paid huge amount of money for construction of the market and the receiver acted himself in dual capacity because he was at the same time a beneficiary in the Trust Property. The learned District Judge did not find any illegality in the order of the Executing Court and in that view of the matter dismissed the revision petition. The other revision filed by the receiver for his entertainment and conveyance allowance was also dismissed.<br/><br/>4. The matter came up before the High Court Division in C.R. No. 692 of 1982. The learned Single Judge took the view that the decree-holder "have been setting contrivances to get out of the orders already passed for payment of the Receiver's lien." It was fur­ther viewed that the Receiver's lien was not liable to be frustrated and in that view of the matter the rule was discharged with costs.<br/><br/>5. Leave was granted to consider the question of imposition of the additional amount for payment of Tk. 7 lacs 78 thousand and odd and furnishing of a Bank guarantee for the balance of Tk. 51,12,365/27 paisa as illegal and unwarranted inasmuch as no such condition was imposed in C.R. Case No. 840 of 1976 when the Court Division directed delivery, of possession sub­ject to furnishing the Bank guarantee of Tk. 3,50,000/- only. The contention of the learned Counsel that the expenditures have never been audited and expenditure of over Taka 43,00,000/- by the Receiver had been consistently as being unauthorized unaudited and further contention of the appellant that the High Court Division erred in law in observing that the decree-holder appellant have been setting up "contrivances to get out of the court's order already passed for payment of the receiver's lien" was unwarranted which merited consideration and leave was accord­ingly granted.<br/><br/>6. Abdullah Welfare Trust was created for the welfare and benefit of the Dhaka Nowab family. As it has been mentioned the said Welfare Trust obtained a compromise decree against the Dhaka Nowab Courts of Wards Estate in Title Suit No. 130 of 1957 and the decree was passed on 3.9.59. The decree contemplated registration of certain registered deed of transfer and transfer of possession of the decretal property to the appellant. The appellant applied for delivery of possession but since the registration of the deeds was not complied the Executing Court by its order dated 20.7.73 appointed respondent as a receiver under section 41 (d) read with rule 1 of Order 40 of the Cede of Civil Procedure. It appears the receiver with Court's permission started constructing commercial building consisting of shop-room in the land of Schedule A of the decree. He disposed of some shops by receiving salami and rent but he did not ren­der any account of expenditure either for construction or of the receipt of  money by  way of salami and rent whereupon the Ex­ecuting Court expressed its dissatisfaction by order dated 6.5.76 It has already been mentioned Contractor N. Ahmed pressed for his due from the respondent and ultima­tely this matter came before the High Court Division in C R No. 840 of 1976 when the High Court Division in its judgment dated 3.8.76 directed the Executing Court to effect delivery of possession to the appellant on their furnishing bank guarantee of Tk. 3,50,000/-. This order was frustrated because in the meantime a move was made by the receiver for appointment of a joint receiver in the per­son of Khawja Mohiuddin who, however, co­uld not function as he died immediately there­after. Hence the sole receiver Khawja Abdul Gani continued to function as a receiver in 1979 the Board of Trustees were consti­tuted after duly held, election and in the meantime documents in question were also registered. Hence the appellant again prayed for delivery of possession in pursuance of the order of the High Court Division passed in C.R. No 840 of 1976 and prayed for direction upon the receiver to submit up-to-date statement of account on income and expenditure and further prayed for stopping payment to the receiver till the accounts were finally settled. The receiver resisted this petition for delivery of possession and he submitted his accounts for the period 1974 to 1980 on 29.9.80. The receiver gave a sum­mary of his account vide Annexure A. These accounts were, however, challenged by the app­ellants who had it audited by an accountant, which is also annexed as Annexure B to B (6). The Executing Court, however, it seems, passed order No. 419 dated 26.11.80: <br/>"D. Hr files written objection against the bills of the Receiver for the years 1974 to June, 1980 Copy not served. Let the petition be kept with the record D. Hr. also files extracts of connected order regarding accounts. Let the same be kept with the records to date for hearing the objection petition as well". <br/>Thereafter numerous orders were passed e.g. on 24.12.80, 26.12.80, 31.12.80, 1.1.81, 14.1.81, 10.2.81 and then on 11.3.81 the following order was passed: <br/>"Parties are ready. The receiver has filed some documents as <em>per firisti</em>. Let the same be kept with the record. Heard the Receiver and the learned Advocate at length over the petition of the D. Hr. dt. 2.9.80 and the objection against it. To 9.4.81 for order". <br/>Be it noted that in the petition of the decree-holder dated 2.9.80 the appellants prayed for delivery of possession and to stop payment to the receiver. On the date fixed 9.4.81 no order was passed as the Court was busy and the next date was 8.5.81 when the Court passed the impugned order as quoted above, e. g. order No. 430 dated 8.5.81. This order has been challenged by the appellant.<br/><br/>7. In sum, the Executing Court passed three orders namely (i) to furnish a bank guarantee for Tk. 3,50,000/- as directed by the High Court: (ii) a sum of Tk. 7,78,792/- was found payable to the receiver by the Court's order No. 321 dated 29.1.77, (iii) the Court noticed the objection regarding the accounts but considered that the previous bills of the receiver were accepted on the basis of Sheristadar’s report which was not opposed by the decree holder and in that view passed the account for an amount of Tk. 41,12, 365/23 for which a bank guarantee is to be given by the appellant.<br/><br/>8. It will be apparent that the objection petition against the account was never heard though the Court by its order No. 491 dated 26.11.80 decided to hear objection instead of hearing the parties the Court passed the aforesaid three directions by the impugned order dated 8.5.81.<br/>The District Judge in revision considered that there was no illegality on the face of re­cord and dismissed the revision by his order dated 26.2.82.<br/><br/>9. The High Court Division dismissed the revision (C. R. No. 692 of 1982) by holding that the "receiver's lien was not liable to be frustrated" and considered that there was no challenge to the accounts of receiver excepting the objection towards the conveyance and entertainment allowance and concluded by observing that the appellants were merely set­ting “contrivances to get out of the orders already passed" for payment of the receiver's lien.<br/><br/>10. To say the least, the matter was not correctly approached in accordance with law. The receiver is appointed under Order 40 rule 1(a) and Clause (c) and (d). The properties is given to his possession, custody and mana­gement and the Court confers such power as emphasised in clause (d). The receiver is therefore an officer of the Court, is a public officer. He is a custodian of the properties by the order of the Court and since he is an officer of the Court be cannot sue and be sued without leave of the Court appointing him. Rule 3 prescribes the duty of the receiver and he is obliged to render his account to the Court and rule 4 provides for enforcement of receiver's duty when he fails to submit his ac­counts or fails to pay the amount due from him as the Court direct. He being a statutory person the Court is obliged to see that he per­forms his function properly and for the bene­fit of trust.<br/><br/>11. Mr. Khondker Mahbubuddin Ahmed has taken us through the summary of accounts submitted by the receiver for the period 1974 to June, 1982. We are surprised to see that the receiver could deal with the Trust property in the manner that has been done in this case. In item 4 he has shown brokerage to indivi­dual without sanction of court. In all these years a sum of Tk. 3, 94, 012.00 were given to individuals without sanction of the Court. (Item 6). Huge amount of money were bor­rowed allegedly from private individual with­out any authority or sanction of the Court (Item 7). The breakup of which is as under: Clause (i) Shabnam Traders...Tk. 90,000,00 Clause (ii) Giasuddin...Tk. 80,000.00 Clause (iii) Nasiruddin Bhuiya...Tk. 18,53,913.00 Clause (iv) Mujibul Hoque...Tk. 7,86,402.26 Clause (v) Shabnam Traders ... Tk. 7, 60,000.00 Clause (vi) Habib Askari... Tk. 1,00,000/-Clause (vii) Azizullah...Tk. 35,000/-Then to cap it all item 8 showed loans from other individuals (without specifying their names) Tk. 2,96,000/; borrowing from Bank is only Tk. 40,000/- and lastly the legal expenses without sanction of court was shown at Tk. 80,000/-. All these expenses were incurred curing the period 1976 to 1980.<br/><br/>12. Mr. Khondker Mahbubuddin Ahmed argued that some of these expenses were not only unauthorised but shocking as it appears from the nature of transactions. Mr. S.R. Pal appearing for the respondent attempted to argue that those expenses done in connection with construction of the market as enviscized in the trust. Notwithstanding that some borrowing had been made without sanction of the court but these bills were checked by the sheristader and the accounts were passed as such it is contended by the respondents that no challenge could be given now to these accounts already passed.<br/><br/>13. We shall deal with the last submissi­ons made by Mr. Paul namely that the account had already been passed should not be reopened. In the case of <strong><em>Mohini Mohan Patra Vs. Ram Narain Patra 14 C.L.J. page 445</em></strong>, a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court considered the same question observing: <br/>''In the case before us, as we have already explained, and as is undisputable upon an examination of the record, the accounts of the Receiver have never been properly taken. In fact, a considerable portion of the accounts has not been submitted till quite recently; and it is not yet quite certain, whether all the accounts for the entire period of management have yet been submitted. Under such circumstances, there can, in our opinion, be no question that the Court should direct a thorough scrutiny into the accounts of the Receiver. It is, moreover, clear from the facts which have transpired in the Course of the arguments addressed to us, that even if the accounts had been more regularly submitted and examined, it would have incumbent on the court to reopen them. The principle is well-settled that a Receiver's accounts, which have been filed and vouched before an examiner, can be re-opened on the discovery of errors in them, notwithstanding that the Judge's certificate is attached and in <strong><em>re Brown (1887)19 ILR Ir. 423</em></strong> and indeed, a Receiver may be surcharged on his accounts, notwithstanding that he has been discharged. In <strong><em>re Edward (1892) 31 Ir. 242</em></strong>. In this respect, the Receiver does not enjoys a wider mea­sure of protection than is accorded to other accounting person in a fiduciary position. <strong><em>Daniel Vs. Sinclair (1881) 6 A.C. 181, Williams Vs. Barbour (1877) 9 Ch. D. 529 and Prasanna Kumar Vs. Burh &amp; Co. (1910) 13 C.L.J. 165</em></strong>".  <br/>With respect, we are in agreement with this principle of law and in this view we are of the opinion that the accounts of the Receiver must be re-checked and reopened by a quali­fied accountant notwithstanding that some of these accounts may have been passed by the Court after the so-called checking by Sheristader.<br/>14. Next as has been mentioned, Rule 3 of the Order 40 enjoins upon the Court to hold the receiver to correct strictness in rendering their accounts and thorough investigation of the accounts supported by voucher is proper. Mere submission of the accounts is not enough. It must be seen whether he has spent the money as per direction of the court. In <strong><em>Coomer Sattya Sankar Ghosal Vs. Ranee Golapmonee Debia 5 C.W.N. 223</em></strong> it was held that when a receiver had submitted his account it is the duty of the court to see, not merely whether, all the collections have been duly entered in the accounts and the expenses supported by vouchers but also whether all the disbursements and payments are properly made in respect of the estate. In <strong><em>Hooper vs. Winston</em></strong> the contention of the receiver that he had some discretionary power was negatived and it was held— <br/>"We hold, being an officer of the Court, he should have applied to the Court for leave to make these expenditures, and he is amenable to the Court for the exercise of all his powers. As Re­ceiver and trustee for parties’ litigant, it was his manifest duty to have kept regular accounts, item, by item, of all the expenses and of the receipts. His judgment was not the limit of the expen­diture, but the Court, he being one of its officers, has a supervisory power over his account, and he is amenable to its judgment as to the necessity of these expenditures. He should have applied to the Court setting out the facts and asking for a reference whether such expenditures would be for the benefit of the interested parties. No single act, calculated to diminish seriously the fund, could the receiver do on his own mere motion and in the exercise of his discretion". <br/><br/>14. That is the limit of his discretion. Though the courts have taken the view that when the receiver has spent out money with­out previous order of the Court and transac­tion by him appears to have been beneficial to the Trust he is entitled to be allowed to be credited in his account for the amount thus expended.<br/><br/>15. On his own showing the receiver has spent huge amounts of money giving broke­rage to the individuals and incurred debt by borrowing from private individuals without sanction of the Court. It is not suggested that some of the expenses was not necessary for the benefit of the Trust and as we have al­ready mentioned such expenditure will not be disallowed. That can also be done when a thorough examination of the account is made and scrutiny of the account supported by the expenditure vouchers are done by a competent accountant who will report his finding to the Court for the purpose of pass­ing account. The observation of the High Court Division that the appellant were unnecessarily setting up "contrivances" to get rid of the order of the court for payment to the receiver is unfortunate when the account was challenged repeatedly and number of petitions were filed to the Court praying for an enquiry into the account and when ulti­mately the Court passed the account in per­functory manner upon the report of the Sheristader and saddling the Trust with a huge amount of money to the extent of Tk. 41 lacs and another Tk. 7 lacs and odd. The least that can be said is that the obser­vation of the High Court Division  was not only unfortunate but the same have been passed, in  utter disregard of the well estab­lished principles in the matter of passing of account.<br/><br/>16. What does a Court do when passes account of Receiver? It means that the Court calls upon the receiver first to produce and file his account which are checked with proper vouchers and other proofs before the Accounting Officer and thereafter they are pressed before the Court which passes them, In passing   such account the court must be taken to approve and sanction both the credit and the debit entries made in that account. When the court gives authority to the receiver to advance money for the benefit of the estate of which he is the receiver and sanction such advance he is entitled to an indemnity out of the assets for that advance. In <strong><em>Boehm Vs Goodall (1911) 1 Ch. 155</em></strong> it was observed: <br/>"I think it is of the utmost impor­tance that receivers and managers in this position should know that they must look for their indemnity to the assets which are under the control of the Court. The Court itself cannot indemnify receivers but it can and will do so out of the assets so far as they extend for expenses properly incurred". <br/><br/>17. The question of defeating receiver's lien as has been observed by the High Court Division does not arise at all. The lien actu­ally belongs to the Court and the receiver being an officer of the court, that lien cannot be lost. If the Court passes the account on the basis of which receiver asked to be paid then the receiver can claim this amount with­out bringing any suit because as was said in <strong><em>Re Regent Canal Iron Works (1876) 3 Ch. D 411 and in Davy Vs. Scarth (1906) 1 Ch. D. 55 </em></strong>the honour of the Court is involved in seeing that the ex-receiver of the Court gets the money that is due on the passing of accounts of the Court. In <strong><em>Ali Ismail Vs. Momin Bibi, A.I.R. 1954 Calcutta 386</em></strong> it was observed: <br/>"It is true the applicant is no longer an officer of the Court and the right to apply which belongs to an officer dock no longer belongs to him as such. But then the fact remains that the claim put forward in the application arises out of the ad­ministration as receiver on the basis of his accounts as receiver duly passed by the Court. Even when third party rights are involved in the course of Court's management the Court allows such third party to initiate <em>pro intersee suo</em> proceed­ings, by application. In such a pro intersee suo application where no difficult question of fact or title arises court makes an order without a suit."  <br/>This principle is well settled and therefore the apprehension of the High Court Division that attempts by the appellant was mere contrivances to get rid of the order of the Court for payment to the receiver does not appear to be sound.<br/><br/>18. Mr. Khondker Mahbubuddin Ahmed has commented on various items of expendi­ture which are unauthorized and which had been made without any authority from the Court. In view of the order we propose to make we shall note in passing that huge amounts of money had been shown as legal expenses. These expenditures are to be veri­fied and   checked, no doubt, along with the borrowing made from private source which invited criticism from Mr. Ahmed.<br/><br/>19. In view of the aforesaid we are of the opinion that the case must be remitted to the Executing Court in order that the accounts of the receiver for the entire period of his mana­gement may be taken. A firm of Chartered Accountants must be appointed for this pur­pose and the said Firm will be authorised not only to verify whether the expenditure is sup­ported by proper vouchers but also to deter­mine whether sums received by the receiver have been properly credited to the Estate and spent for the legitimate purpose. The objec­tion to the account when submitted before the Court should be formulated with precision and for this purpose every facility will be afforded to the parties and their legal advisers to examine accounts, vouchers and all connec­ted papers so as to enable them to draw up their objection and the Executing Court upon consideration of this objection will draw a final order for adjusting the right and liability of the parties and the receiver. It is to be clearly understood that in the end, if it trans­pires that the claims of the creditors exhaus­ted the amount in respect of which the receiver is entitled to be reimbursed the liability must fall upon the receiver himself. In view of the above, we direct as under:<br/>(1) The order of the High Court Divi­sion in C.R. No. 840 of 1976 dated 3.8.76 is to be enforced by delivery of possession to the Chairman of the Board of Trustees within 10 days from today on furnishing the Bank guarantee of Tk. 3,50,000/-;<br/>(2) An indemnity bond for unascer­tained amount incurred by the receiver during his entire tenure i.e. from his appointment up to the date of delivery of possession will be furnished by the appel­lants;<br/>(3) The Account of the Trust during the entire tenure of the receiver will be audited by a firm of Chartered Accoun­tants, namely M/s Rahman Huq &amp; Co., 82 Motijheel C.A., Dhaka-2.<br/>(4) The Receiver is to submit the account for the purpose of auditing to the Executing Court within six weeks from today and the account so submitted to the Executing Court will be forwarded to the aforesaid firm of Chartered Ac­countants.<br/>(5) Thereafter the said firm will sub­mit the report for passing of the account by the Executing Court.<br/>(6) On examination of the said audit report the executing court will pass the account after hearing the parties and the receiver will be discharged.<br/>(7) Auditor’s fees will be borne by the Trust. <br/>In the result, therefore, appeal is allowed. No order as to costs. The impugned order is set aside and the orders of the courts below are also set aside.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
