We have heard the learned Advocate for the petitioner and perused materials on record. It appears that since there was nothing in writing before the trial Court about the fact that learned engaged Advocate for defendant Nos.1 and 2 agreed to the passing of the <em>status quo </em>order on both sides, the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 had legal scope to deny the said fact afterwards. The learned District Judge correctly observed that there was nothing before the Court about the fact that he orally agreed to the passing of <em>status quo </em>order before the trial Court. Accordingly, the learned District Judge allowed Miscellaneous Appeal setting aside status-quo order dated 01.03.2006 passed by the trial Court. If the petitioner has any reason to be aggrieved he could file a fresh application for redress of the same or make a prayer for modification of the order to cope with any eventuality. We do not find any cause to interfere with the impugned order.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
