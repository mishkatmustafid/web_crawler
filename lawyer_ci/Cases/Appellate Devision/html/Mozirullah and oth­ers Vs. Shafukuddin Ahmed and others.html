The plaintiff respondent filed the suit for declaration of title to acres of land (Schedule-ka) out of a total of .7 acres of land in khatian No. 5, plot No. 202 of Mouza 171 Dagan Bhuiyan (Schedule-kha) and for recovery of possession thereof. It is the case of the plaintiff that Hamid Ali and Azhar Ali, two brothers, by an amicable family partition arranged that Hamid Ali will get .7 acres of land in plot No.202, khatian No.5 (Schedule-kha) and other lands and that Azhar Ali will get .7 acres of land in plot No. 197, khatian No. 3 both of Mouza Dagan Bhuiyan. Accordingly Azhar Ali while in exclusive ownership and pos­session of his allotted share sold his entire share in khatian No. 3 to Sirajul Haque and divested himself of all interests therein. Hamid Ali sold the entire .7 acres of land in plot No. 202 to his son Bashirullah by a registered deed dated 23-3-53. Bashirullah in his turn sold .3½ acres out of .7 acres of land to his brother Hafizullah by a regis­tered deed dated 26-10-60. Thereafter both Bashirullah and Hafizullah sold the entire .7 acres of land to the plaintiff and his mother Hashmater Nessa by a registered deed dated 15-2-65. After the death of the plaintiff's mother the plaintiff has been owning and possessing the Schedule Kha land as her only heir. The Schedul kha land was originally a nal land which the plaintiff convert­ed into a bhiti land. He has constructed a kitchen in the bhiti and has stored some bricks and other house building materials. One Azizul Haque is occupying a portion thereof as a tenant under the plaintiff, the remaining land being in the khas possession of the plaintiff. On 16-12-78 defendant No. 1, a son of Azhar Ali, in the absence of the plaintiff, dispossessed him from the kutcha room in the north eastern portion of Schedule kha land measuring 1<sup>1</sup>/4 acres which is the suit land, the M. R. O. R. kha­tian has been prepared in the name of the plaintiff's vendor Bashirullah. The plaintiff has mutated his name and has been paying rent. The defendants have no right, title and interest in .7 acres of land of khatian No. 5. Hence the suit.<br/><br/>3. Defendant No.1 alone and defen­dant Nos.2 and 5-7 together filed separate written statements and denied the plaintiff's case. They admitted that there was an ami­cable partition between the two brothers Hamid Ali and Azhar Ali and that Azhar Ali got in his share .7 acres of land in plot No. 197 in khatian No.3, but it is their com­mon case that Hamid Ali was given .7 acres of land in plot No.192 of khatian No.46 of the same Mouza and Hamid Ali subse­quently transferred his entire share of .7 acres in khatian No.46 to one Abdul Gani who made a structure on that land and let out to the Sub-Registrar's office of Dagan Bhuiyan. Defendant No.1 stated in his written statement that his father Azahar Ali had .3<sup>1</sup>/2 acres of share in plot No.202 which he transferred to defendant No.1 and his 5 brothers by two deeds of Hiba-bil-Ewaz dated 14-11-60 and 17-11-60. The six brothers raised the land, constructed a kutcha house and have been conducting therein the business of selling pan and fire­wood's since long. The plaintiff has not constructed any kutcha house on the north eastern corner of the plot. He has not stored any bricks there. No person called Azizul Huq has any construction there. There has been a fraudulent and wrong recording of rights in the recent khatinas. It is stated by defendant Nos.2 and 5-7 in their written statement that .7 acres of land of plot No.202 of khatian No.5 (schedule kha) remained in the ejmali of Hamid Ali and Azhar Ali. Hamid Ali has no saleable inter­est in the land of khatian No. 5, plot No. 202 beyond his 8 annas interest i.e. .3½ acres. The plaintiff or his vendors Bashirullah and Hafizullah were never owners and possessors of more than .3<sup>1</sup>/2 acres of land in plot No. 202. The plaintiff is not entitled to any decree in the present suit. His remedy lies in a suit for partition seeking separate saham of his own portion of plot No. 202. The present suit is a test case to dislodge the defendants right, title and interest by way of making a foray into .1¼ acres out of .7 acres of land of plot No.202.<br/><br/>4. The plaintiff examined 8 witness­es and the defendants examined 7 witnesses and both sides exhibited various docu­ments.<br/><br/>The trial Court found title in favour of the plaintiff on consideration of Hamid Ali's document of sale to his son Bashirullah (Ext. 2(a) Bashiruilahs's trans­fer of .3 ½ acres of land to his brother Hafizullah (Ext.2) and Bashirullah and Hafizullah's transfer of .7 acres of land to the plaintiff and his mother Ext. 2(B). The trial Court also found that the S.A. khatian (Ext. B) stands in the name of the plaintiff's vendor Bashirullah. It also found that the plaintiff mutated his name and paid rent to the Government by rent receipts (Ext.3 series). Series of kabalas Ext. 5A to 5E show that Azhar Ali and his heirs sold away all the .7 acres of land which Azhar Ali obtained by way of partition in plot No.197 of khatian No.3. The trial Court also considered the case of the plaintiff's possession and subsequent dispossession and found that the plaintiff has been able to prove his case.<br/><br/>5. The appellant Court below found that there was no dispute between the par­ties that Azhar Ali got in his share .7 acres in plot No. 197, khatian No. 3. The dispute is whether Hamid Ali got .7 acres in plot No. 202, khatian No. 5, as claimed by the plaintiff or .7 acres of land in plot No. 192, No. 46, as clamied by the defendants. Khatian No.46 was exhibited by the plain­tiff. The appellate Court below found that the plaintiff could not give any personal knowledge of the amicable partition and P.W. 3 Hafizullah and P.W. 8 Bashirullah also could not give proper relevant answers relating to partition in their cross-examina­tion. The appellate Court below found that in khatian No.46 there are 2.58 acres of land and Azhar Ali is the owner by pur­chase in respect of .83 acres of land therein. In this khatian Hamid Ali had no owner­ship. The appellant Court below noted the case of the defendants that Hamid Ali obtained .7 acres of land from khatian No. 46, plot No. 192. P.W. 8 Bashirullah, son of Hamid Ali admitted in his cross-examina­tion that his father Hamid Ali used to pos­sess .7 acres of land of khatian No.46, plot No.192 and that the said land is now being possessed by Abdul Gani. That is precisely the case of the defendants and the appellate Court below found that this admission by P.W. 8 weakened the case of the plaintiff. The appellate Court below then considered Ext. 5 series, which were earlier considered by the trial Court and found that by Ext. 5 series the sons of Azhar Ali sold the land of plot No.197, khatian No. 3 and also other lands of khatian No. 46 to various persons. In view of the fact that the defendants admit Azhar Ali's share in plot No.197, khatian No. 3 and in view of the fact that Azhar Ali had independent title to .83 acres of land in khatian No.46 the appellate Court below, contrary to the finding of the trial Court, found that Ext .5 series do not support the plaintiff's case at all. The appellant Court below also held that since there was no par­tition by metes and bounds the recording of the land of khatian No. 5 in the name of Bashirullah and the mutation of it in favour of the plaintiff does not create any presump­tion. The defendant’s title thereto have not been injured thereby.<br/><br/>6. The appellant Court below also discussed the plaintiff's evidence on pos­session and dispossession and found that the plaintiff has not been able to prove his case in this respect as well. As such the trial Court's decree was interfered with and the suit was dismissed.<br/><br/>7. In revision the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division disposed of the judgment of the lower appellate Court in the following terms:- <br/>"The learned appellate Court as it appears from his judgment without considering the evidence either the documentary evidence or the oral evidence abruptly came to the con­clusion that the plaintiff failed to prove his title. The learned Judge also failed to consider the evidence as to possession and dispossession. The suit being a suit for declaration of title and recovery of possession, the learned Judge ought to have considered the evidence relating to title as well as possession and fur­ther the act of dispossession so as to pass a finding as to pass a decree or dismissing the suit. Non considera­tion of vital evidence relating to possession and dispossession affect­ed the decision of the learned Judge materially and this error has occa­sioned a failure of justice. The find­ing arrived at by the trial Court having not been adverted, the judgment complained of is not a proper judg­ment for reversal as such is liable to be set aside." <br/><br/>8. Leave was granted to consider the submission that the High Court Division interfered with the findings of fact of the Court of appeal below, the last Court of fact, without considering the evidence on record and erroneously held that the Court of appeal below abruptly came to the con­clusion that the plaintiff failed to prove his title.<br/><br/>9. Mr. Moksudur Rahman, learned Advocate for the appellants, has taken us through the judgment of the lower appellate Court and submitted that the court of appeal below has exhaustively considered both the oral and documentary evidence. The lower appellate Court's conclusion that the plain­tiff failed to prove his title was not abrupt at all rather it is the finding of the High Court Division which is abrupt. He also pointed out that the appellate Court below fully considered the evidence as to possession and dispossession.<br/><br/>10. Mr. Khandkher Mahbubuddin Ahmed, learned Advocate for the respon­dents has taken us through both the judg­ment of the trial Court and the appellate Court below. He could not show from the judgment of the trial Court and the appel­late court below. He could not show from the judgment of the trial Court that the find­ing of title in favour of the plaintiff has been arrived at after considering the plaintiff's case on khatian No.5 and the defendants case on khatian No.46. Also he could not show that the trial Court at all adverted to the bone of contention between the parties, namely, whether Hamid Ali obtained in his share land from khatian No.5 or from kha­tian No. 46. The trial Court seems to have decided the plaintiff's title in khatian No. 5 by finding that Azhar Ali and his heirs exhausted by sale his share in plot No.197 which does not establish that Hamid Ali received in his share land of khatian No.5. The trial Court has not considered the state of khatian No. 46 at al although it was exhibited by the plaintiff and has not dealt with the admission of P.W. 8 Bashirullah that his father used to possess .7 acres of land in khatian No. 46 and that the said land is now being possessed by Abdul Gani which is the defendants case. Mr. Ahmed also could not show that the lower appellate Court did not consider the oral and docu­mentary evidence and that its conclusion about the plaintiff's title was arrived at abruptly. Nor he could show that the appel­late Court below failed to consider the evi­dence as to possession and dispossession.<br/><br/>11. Mr. Khandker Mahbubddin Ahmed then submits ultimately that if the High Court Division was not correct in its criticism of the judgment of the Court of appeal below then the matter should be remanded to the High Court Division for hearing of the civil revision afresh.<br/><br/>12. We would have done so, had it not been for the fact that the trial Court completely missed the bone of contention between the parties and that the court of appeal below applied its mind to the real controversy between, the parties and has written out an exhaustive judgment dis­cussing both the oral and documentary evidence in details leaving no room for further improvement. It will therefore be a futile exercise to send the case back on remand to the High Court Division, particularly when Mr. Khankder Mahbubddin Ahmed could not point out any illegality occasioning fail­ure of justice in the judgment of the lower appellate court which merits a re-consideration.<br/><br/>13. We therefore find that the defen­dant appellants are rightly aggrieved by the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division.<br/><br/>14. The appeal is allowed with costs. The impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division are set aside and the judgment and decree dated 31-1-90 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, Feni in Title Appeal No. 27 of 1986 are affirmed.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
