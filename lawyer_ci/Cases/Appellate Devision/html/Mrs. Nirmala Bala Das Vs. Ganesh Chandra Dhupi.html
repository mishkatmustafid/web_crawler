The trial Court believed the plaintiffs settlement and dakilas Ext. 1 series upon assigning proper reasons. Plaintiff got the settlement as far back as on 15 Chaitra 1355 B.S. which corresponded to March, 1948 but the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949 came into force on 20<sup>th</sup> October, 1949. As such its application in respect of the suit property does not arise at all. Undisputedly Gopalganj Pourashava was created in the year 1972. Plaintiff filed the suit in 1948 on the basis of her taking settlement in 1948. Thus when both the trial court as well as the lower appellate court upon consideration of both oral and documentary evidence held that the plaintiff in 1355 B.S. took settlement of the suit land as an agricultural land, the learned Judge of the High Court Division appears to have acted illegally and without jurisdiction in reversing a concluded finding of fact in exercise of his revisional jurisdiction and thereby misdirected himself in holding that the suit land is a non-agricultural land and that the plaintiffs settlement of the suit land having not been made by a registered instrument she did not acquire any valid title thereto. Without even discussing the definition of non-agricultural land provided in section 2 (4) of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949 the learned Judge come to a new finding of fact. We have no hesitation to hold that the learned Judge was not filed in dismissing the suit.                        … (12)</strong></div> <br/><strong>Lawyers Involved:</strong><br/><em>Sharifuddin Chaklader, Advocate-on-Record </em>- <em>For the Appellant</em><br/><em>Kazi Shahadat Hossain, Advocate, instruct­ed by Md. Nawab Ali, Advocate-on-Record </em>- <em>For the Respondent</em><br/><br/><strong>Civil Appeal No. 57 of 1991.</strong><br/>(From the Judgment and Order dated 19.5.1991 passed by the High Court Division, Dhaka in Civil Revision No. 469 of 1985)<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Judgment</strong></span><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mohammad Abdur Rouf J.- </strong>This appeal by the plaintiffs, following leave, is from the judgment and order dated 5.12.91 passed by a learned single judge of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 469 of 1985 making the Rule absolute and setting aside thereby the judgment and decree of affirmance dated 31.5.85 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, Gopalgonj dismissing Title Appeal No. 265 of 1983 and affirming thereby the judg­ment and decree dated 31.1.83 passed by the learned Munsif, Gopalgonj decreeing Title suit No. 678 of 1968, a suit for declaration of title to suit land and partition.<br/><br/>2. Plaintiff's case in short is that the suit land originally belonged to 3 brothers, namely Nogendra Nath Dhupi, Banikanta Dhupi and Haren Chandra Dhupi in equal shares. Banikanta Dhupi sold out his share to his son defendant No. 1 Nogendra Nath was survived by his 2 sons Hardipada Dhupi and Habu Dhupi, who on 15 Chaitra, 1355 B.S. made settlement of their 1/3 share to the plaintiff at a rental of Rs. 1/- by granting dakila by Haripada as the Karta of the Hindu joint family and inducted the plaintiff into possession therein. Plaintiff demanded partition by metes and bounds but the defendant denied partition on 10.8.68.<br/><br/>3. Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 filed written statement for contesting the suit but subsequent­ly defendant No. 2 did not contest the suit rather by filing Solenama he compromised the suit with the plaintiff, admitting plaintiff's right, title and possession in the suit land.<br/><br/>4. Defendant No. 1 alone contested the suit contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit was not maintainable as framed and it was barred by limitation. He also denied right, title and interest of the plaintiff in the suit land. His further cases is that before partition of India, Nogendra, embraced Christianity and he along with his sons, daughter and  wife started living at Orakandi Mission. On the abolition of the said Mission, they left for India for good making an oral gift of the suit land in favour of defendant Nos. 1 and 2. The plaintiff is a monthly tenant of defendant No. 2 in respect of the suit proper­ty but she having refused to pay rent defendant No. 2 thereat ended to dispossess her from the suit land. As a result she filed an absolutely false suit upon creating some ante dated dakhilas.<br/><br/>5. The Trial Court decreed the suit believ­ing the evidence of P.Ws and Ext. 1 series, the dakhilas holding, <em>inter alia</em>, plaintiff’s right, title, interest and possession in the suit land the trial court further held that the contesting defendant could not prove his alleged oral gift of the suit land from Nogendra but in the written statement he stated that 4 sons of Nogendra had made the oral gift.<br/><br/>6.  The lower Appellant Court on appeal affirmed the decree of the trial court holding, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit land at the relevant time was not a non-agricultural land and as such the contention of the defendant that the suit is hit by section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act and by Section 23 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act does not hold good.<br/><br/>7. The High Court Division held that the Courts below upon a misinterpretation of the provisions of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act wrongly held that the suit land was not a non-agricultural land. The learned Judge further held that the suit land being a non-agricultural land, it could not be legally transferred by the heirs of Nogendra to the plaintiff by an unregis­tered instrument and as such the plaintiff is not entitled to declaration of title on the basis of the alleged lease.<br/><br/>8. Leave was granted to consider whether the learned judge of the High Court Division properly construed the definition of the word 'Non-agricultural Land' provided in section 2(4) of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949 keeping in view the fact that the S.A. Khatian, produced before the High Court Division was prepared long after the settlement of the suit land in favour of the plaintiff and  that Gopalgonj Pourashave was established in 1972 where as the dakhilas in question (Ext. 1) were granted in favour of the plaintiff as far back as in 1948 when registration of the transfer was not compulsory.<br/><br/>9. Mr. Sharifuddin Chaklader learned Advocate-on-record appearing for the appellant submits that the learned Judge of the High Court Division erred in taking into considera­tion the certified copy of the S.A. record sub­mitted for the first time before the High Court Division where the suit plot has been recorded to be a homestead land and thereby misdirected himself in holding that the suit land being non-agricultural land it was not legally settled with the plaintiff merely by executing dakhila. Mr. Chaklader also submits that the plaintiff got the settlement of the suit land in 1948 as an agricul­tural land which was concurrently found by the courts below on consideration of the evidence on record and that Gopalgonj Pourshava having been created long after making of settlement of the suit land with the plaintiff the learned Judge of the High Court Division erred in law in hold­ing that on the basis of the entry in the S.A. record as to the nature of the suit property as homestead on being situated within Gopalgonj municipality, the plaintiff's alleged settlement is hit by section 107 of the T.P. Act and by sec­tion 23 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1949. Mr. Chaklader further submits that the learned Judge of the High Court Division misconstrued the definition of non agricultural land provided in section 2(4) of the Non-agricultural Tenancy Act, so far as the instant case is con­cerned and that the learned Judge has also acted illegally in setting aside the concurrent findings of fact of the Court below that the suit land was not non- agricultural land.<br/><br/>10. Kazi Shahadat Hossain, learned Counsel appearing for defendant No. 1 respon­dent, on the other hand, submits that the suit land is situated at the heart of Gopalgonj town within the municipal area and the same was recorded correctly in the S.A. record as home­stead land. Mr. Hossain further submits that the learned Judge of the High Court Division on consideration of the evidence of P.W. 3, tenant of the plaintiff, living in the suit land, and the entry in the S.A. record was justified in holding that the courts below wrongly held that the suit land at the relevant time was agricultural land.<br/><br/>11. The courts below rejected the submis­sion made on behalf of contesting defendant No. 1 that in view of the provisions of Section 107 of the T.P. Act and section 23 of the Non-agricultural Tenancy Act, plaintiff did not acquire any right, title and interest by settle­ment of the suit land through dakilas. The courts below believed the plaintiffs story of set­tlement and granting of dakhilas Ext. 1 series and decreed the suit, The courts below further held that the contesting defendant could not substantiate by adducing any documentary evidence that the plaintiff is tenant under defen­dant No. 2 in the suit land, Rather defendant No. 2 by submitting a solenama admitted plaintiff's right, title interest and possession in the suit land.<br/><br/>12. It is true that at present the suit land is situated within Gopalgonj municipality and it is the case of the plaintiff that she along with her husband and other family members has been residing thereby erecting huts and that she has also let out some portion of the hut to P.W.3. The trial court believed the plaintiff's settle­ment and daklilas Ext. 1 series upon assigning proper reasons. Plaintiff got the settlement as far back as on 15 Chaitra 1355 B.S. which cor­responded to March, 1948 but the Non-agricul­tural Tenancy Act, 1949 came into force on 20th October, 1949. As such its application in respect of the suit property does not arise at all. Undisputedly Gopalgonj Pourashav was creat­ed in the year 1972. Plaintiff filed the suit in 1968 on the basis of her taking settlement in 1948, Thus when both the trial court as well as the lower appellate court upon consideration of both oral and documentary evidence held that the plaintiff in 1355 B.S. took settlement of the suit land as an agricultural land, the learned Judge of the High Court Division appears to have acted illegally and without jurisdiction in reversing a concluded finding of fact in exer­cise of his revisional jurisdiction and thereby misdirected himself in holding that the suit land is a non-agricultural land and that the plaintiff's settlement of the suit land having not been made by a registered instrument she did not acquire any valid title thereto. Without even discussing the definition of non-agricultural land provided in Section 2(4) of the Non agri­cultural Tenancy Act, 1949 the learned Judge come to a new finding of fact. We have no hes­itation to hold that the learned Judge was no justified in dismissing the suit.<br/>The appeal is allowed without any order as to cost. The impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division are set aside and the judgment and decree of the lower appellate court are restored.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
