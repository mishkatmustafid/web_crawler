Tafazzul Islam J.- </strong>Since both the appeals by leave arise out of the judgment and order dated 23.7.2000 passed by the High Court Division in Writ petition Nos.3002 and 3029 of 1999 and in both the appeals similar facts as well as point of law are involved, those were heard analogously and are disposed of by this single judgment.<br/><br/>2. In Writ petition Nos. 3002 and 3029 of 1999, out of which the present Civil Appeal Nos. 129 and 130 of 2001 respectively arose, the writ petitioners, the appellants herein, chal­lenged the Memo dated 29.7.99 issued by the respondent No. 2, Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Dhaka requesting the Deputy Commissioner of Police (West), Dhaka Metropolitan Police, to deploy 40 armed police so that the illegal trespassers who were in possession of 1.37 acres of land which has been leased to Mr. Habibur Rahman Khan and 31 others in V. P. Case No. 210 of 1980 could be evicted on 5.8.1999 at 11 A. M. and in the above Memo the Deputy Commissioner to Police (West) Dhaka was also informed that Mr. Badra Munir Ferdous Assistant Commissioner and magistrate, Dhaka Collect rate, was to carry out the above eviction.<br/><br/>3. In Writ Petition No. 3002 of 1991 the Writ petitioner stated inter alia that she, by reg­istered kabala Nos.1608 and 2131 dated 25.5.1978 and 10.7.1978 respectively, pur­chased 8 kathas of land from Mrs. Mahmuda Akhter Rashid and Mosammat Barkatannesa and received possession thereof and as required for mutation she sought clarification from the respondents No. 2 as to whether the above prop­erty was listed as vested property whereupon by certificate under Memo. No. 4818 V. P. dated 28.11.1978 addressed to the Circle Officer (Rev). P.S.- Tajgaon Dhaka the respondents No. 2 certified that the above property has not been listed as vested property and on the basis of the same her name was mutated and then she recording her name in the hal record of right had been in exclusive possession of 8 Kathas of land of Plot No. 24 (Hal No. 30) listed in C. S Khatian No. 209. S.A. Khatian No.171 and 117, DP Khatian No. 60, J L No. 237 (New) Mouza Paikpara petition through her represen­tatives but all on a sudden in the afternoon of 5.8.1999 she came to know that her representa­tives, who were in possession of the above property on her behalf were being forcibly evicted with the help of police force and local mustans without serving any notice whatsoever and later on Mr. Shah  Mohammad Abul Hossain, Member of Parliament and a relation of the appellant, succeeded in making contact with the respondent No. 2 over telephone who then informed Mr. Hossain that he passed the impugned order dated 29.7.99 as the land in question is vested property and the action of eviction was taken pursuant to his order and then Mr. Hossain by meeting the respondent No. 2 personally insisted for a copy of the order dated 29.7.1999 and then only a copy of the same was supplied to Mr. Hossain. In Writ Petition No. 3029 of 1999 the writ petitioners more or less stated similar facts except that by registered Deeds of Sale Nos. 7770, 7552, 7553, 7771 and 9607 dated 26.10.1995, 3.9.1981, 3.9.1981, 26.10.1995 and 25.11.1985 respec­tively they purchased 17 kathas of land from the same Plot No. 24 from the owners, namely Mrs. Abeba Banu, Mrs. Saju Begum and late Mrs. Saleka Majumder and since then they, through their representatives, were possession of the above 17 kathas of land till their eviction from there on 5.8.99.<br/><br/>4. In both the Writ Petitions the respondents filed affidavits in opposition on 2.5.2000, 3.5.2000 and on 2.4.2000 stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the case land is a vested property and the ven­dors of appellants had no title or saleable inter­est at all in the case land; the appellants did not acquire any right title and interest therein; 1.54 acre of viti land of the above mentioned Plot No. 24 originally belonged to Ramlochan Randa, the C.S. recorded tenant, and during S. A. Operation Chandra. Sarker and his wife Mrinalini Sarker and since they left for India long before 1965 without transferring their properties to any body the case land has been declared as enemy property and vested in the Custodian and subsequently in pursuance of Enemy, Property (Continuance and Emergency Provisions) Repeal Act, 1974 (Act XLV of 1974), the said property was declared as vested property and vested in the Government of Bangladesh, the case land has also duly been enlisted in the Census List as enemy/vested property after the above vesting the then Sub-Divisional Officer, on the prayer of Abdul Majid Dewan and 7 others, after starting V.P. Case No. 210 of 1980, leased out 1.37 acres to them under Memo No. 1117 (13) V.P. dated 18.7.80 who paid lease money for the year 1387 B.S. and subsequently Mr. Habibur Rahman Khan and 31 others, applied to the District Administration for taking lease of the above vested property and then on enquiry the said Mr. Habibur Rahman Khan and 31 others hav­ing been found to be deserving candidates and the earlier lessees having failed to pay lease money with effect from 1387 B.S. the District Administration sent proposal for granting lease of the case land to Habibur Rahman Khan and 31 others and the Dhaka Metropolitan Vested Property Allotment Committee headed by the Additional commissioner, Dhaka Division in its meeting on 24.3.1999 accepted the above pro­posal on the basis of which the respondent No. 2 vide Memo No. 349 (32) V. P. dated 4.5.1999 Dhaka issued order for lease of the case land in favour of Habibur Rahman Khan and 31 others and also ordered for eviction of the trespassers who subsequently trespassed in the case land and in order to deliver possession to the above leasees who paid lease money for the period from 1387 B.S. to 1406 B.S. under different D.C.R. after issuing possession within 7 (seven) days, the impugned Memo dated 29.7.1999 was issued and on 5.8.1999 trespassers were evicted and then above leasees were delivered physical possession in the case land and that the appel­lants and/or their representatives were not possessing the case property for the last 21 years and were not also using the property as registered office of a private limited company as alleged.<br/><br/>5. In Writ Petition No. 3002 of 1999 the Writ Petitioner on 8.5.2000 filed a supplemen­tary affidavit and in paragraph 7 of the same categorically stated that Circle office (Rev) Tejgaon, Dhaka disposed of the said V.P. Case No. 210 of 1980 stating that Plot No. 24 SA Khatian No. 171 with a total acre of 1.54 stands recorded in the name of (a) Jagesh Chandra Sarker (b) Begum Sultena Jahan (c) Anwara Hoque (d) Mirnalini Sarker and (e) Torap Ali and Josgesh Chandra and Mrinalini sold their entire shares to the appellants by virtue of dif­ferent deeds and bia deeds and then on the basis of the transfer deeds, clearance certificate being Memo No. 4818 V.P. dated 28.11.78 issued by the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) Dacca vide his memo No. 4818 V.P. dated 28.11.1978 and the appellants being found in physical possession of the case land, their names were mutated vide orders in different mutation cases and then in process R.S. Record have been prepared in their names and. or their predecessors. In the above supplemen­tary affidavit it was further stated that land rev­enue taxes were paid and Dakhilas are available with the writ petitioner and will be produced in court if so necessary and that in the Current Land Revenue Settlement, attestation of the land of the writ petitioner was done and Khatian Parchas were issued recognizing the right and title of the writ petitioner to the case land vide Attestation when some claimants wanted to contest the right title of the writ petitioner to the case land, the concerned Settlement Officer rejected their appeal and decided the matter in favour of the writ petitioner under section 30 of the Tenancy Act, 1950 vide his order dated 18.01.2000 and certified copy of the said order dated 18.01.2000 is available with the writ peti­tioner and would be produced in court of so necessary and that the R.S. Parcha under Khatian No. 60 Revenue Survey No. 763 for the period 1969-89 made it clear that Mr. Jogesh Chandra Sarkar and his wife were till then in Bangladesh as owner of the land in question i.e. C.S. and S.A. Plot No. 24 corresponding to R.S. Plot No. 30 and as such the land in question was not shown, enlisted as enemy and vested prop­erty and that accordingly the R.S. survey map of Mouza Paikpara No. 37 sheet no. 1 Revenue Survey No. 763 was prepared covering the peri­od 1969-89.<br/><br/>6. In Writ Petition No. 3029 of 1999 the respondent No.1 on 11.5.2000 filed another affidavit in opposition stating that according to the decision Dhaka Municipal vested Properties Allotment Committee, notice for surrendering possession were issued upon the trespassers under Memo No. 916(3) dated 15.07.1999.<br/><br/>7. As it appear the High Court Division dis­charged the Rules upon observing that "It is will settled that in a case where basic facts are disputed and the complicated questions of law and fact depending on evidence were involved the writ jurisdiction is not the proper forum for seeking relief. Affidavit evidence placed before us are not sufficient to decide the propriety of the foundation of the petitioners title and so on the strength of the possessory title claimed on that basis which is itself a disputed matter the petitioners cannot get the relief they have prayed for both the writ petition are liable to be dismissed on this preliminary ground".<br/><br/>8. Leave was granted to consider the sub­missions that "limited question raised in the writ petition being that whether in the facts and circumstances of the case the respondents par­ticularly respondent No. 2 acted lawfully in treating the property of the petitioners as vested property and leasing out the same to the out­sider, that the High Court Division was in error in discharging the Rule upon observing "the instant matter, we find is not so simple" and that in entering into the question of conflicting claim of title as in fact the persons named in V. P. Case No. 210 of 1980 were the original owners that the learned Judges of the High Court Division misdirected themselves and question of title and that raising "disputed facts" of their own as because the property in question even if declared as enemy property by the V. P. Case No. 210 of 1080, which in fact was not done, could not have been obviously said after repeal of the Enemy Property Ordinance, 1969 that the High Court Division was in error in discharging the Rule in spite of not finding the inquiry report in connection with V.P. Case No. 210 of 1980 as being conclusive as is apparent from the judgment of the High Court Division itself."<br/><br/>9. Mr. Mahmudul Islam, the learned coun­sel appearing for the appellants in both the appeals, submits that from the judgment of the High Court Division it is clear that although the said V.P. Case was started in the year 1980 but as is evident from the certificate dated 28.11.78 of C.O. Revenue, at that point of time it was not yet decided whether the case land was vested property and further from the contents of the report dated 8.2.84 on which the High Court Division relied, it is evident that admittedly till 1984 the lands in question was vested property and the High Court Division discharged the Rule without at all appreciating the position of law that after repeal of the Enemy Property (Continuance and Emergency Provisions) Ordinance, 1969 by the Enemy Property (Continuance of Emergency Provision) (Repeal) Act, 1974 there was no power or authority of the respondent No. 2 to declare any property vested newly if not vested earlier and that in their affidavits in opposition the respon­dents though categorically asserted that in the Census List the case land was duly enlisted it as enemy property but they did not annex the Census List in their affidavits in opposition and during hearing of the present appeals, the respondents prayed for adjournment to enable them to file the Census List but spite of allow­ing adjournment they failed to file the same. Mr. Islam next submits that the issues of "dis­puted facts" and "cloud over title" on the basis of which the High Court Division discharged the Rule were not required to be resolved for disposal of the Rules and farther before eviction no notice whatsoever was served upon the appellants and/or their representative and moreover they were also not given any opportu­nity of being heard before declaring the case land as enemy and or vested property and fur­ther the names of the appellants being mutated as back as 1978 and they having paid rents and their names being receded in the hal record of right the respondents  illegally  evicted them from the case land.<br/><br/>10. Mr. Abdur Razzak Khan, the learned Additional Attorney General appearing for the respondents submits that the case land in ques­tion vested in the Government long ago and the above V.P. Case No. 210 of 1980 was started only for the purpose of leasing out the case property to persons who applied for lease and the High Court Division correctly discharged the Rule as claims of title as well as disputed question of facts were very much involved in the writ petitioners.<br/><br/>11. Regarding vesting of the case land in the Government, the report dated 8.2.84 relying on which the High Court Division discharged the Rule and which has been reproduced in the impugned judgment at its end <em>the </em>following statement was made. In view of the above cir­cumstances the property left by Mr. Jogesh Chandra Sarker and Mrinalini Sarker may be brought under management and control of the V.P. organization evicting the unauthorized occupier.<br/><br/>12. So on the face the above statement what more facts are required to show that before 8.02.1984 the case land was not declared vested property.<br/><br/>13. Further in the above report dated 8.2.84 as reproduced in the impugned judgment it has been stated that "Since Jogesh, Mrinalini, Mrs. Anowara Haque and Gegum Sultana Jahan were the owners of 1.54 acres of land as per S.A. record, notices were served by the S.D. O, Dhaka Sadar upon Anwara Hoque and 6 others who were in occupation of the land as per report of the V.P. Tahsilder; the staff of the Office of SDO in verifying the R.O. R's of C.O. ( Rev) office Tejgaon have  also  found that Sajeda Begum and 14 others mutated their names in the records of office of the C.O.(Rev) Tejgaon and notices were served upon the persons who mutated their names", and as is evident from the contents of the supplementary affidavit dated 14.6.2000 filed in Writ petition No. 3002 of 1999 the above Sajeda Begum is Saju Hossain, the writ petitioner in Writ petition No. 3002 of 1999 and the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 129 of 2001 and thus according to the contents of the above report Saju Hossain and also 14 prayed for lease in the year 1980 and obviously at that time case land was not in the list of vest­ed property. Further thought in their affidavits in opposition the respondents stated that in the Census List the case land was enlisted as enemy property but they did not annex the Census List in their affidavits in opposition and during hear­ing of the appeals on the prayer of the respon­dents the hearing was adjourned to enable them to produce the Census List but inspite of the same they could not produce the Census List.<br/><br/>14. Moreover in the above report dated 08.02.84 as reproduced in the impugned judg­ment the respondents took the stand to the effect that before considering the prayer of A. Majid and 7 others for lease notices were served upon the persons who already mutated their names to show cause as to how they have mutated their names but only Khorshed Ali and Md. Mohsin showed cause stating <em>inter alia</em> that they became owners of a portion of the case land by purchase by registered kabalas and pro­duced documents showing purchase of 0.825 and 1650 acres of land and in the aforesaid cir­cumstances S.D.O Dhaka Sadar called for a report from the C.O. (Rev) Tajgaon about the nationality of Jogesh and Mrinalini and the nature of the land and it was reported that Jogesh and Mrinalini were not Bangladesh National at the time of transfer of the lands and that the nature of lands is vity and then S.D.O. Dhaka Sadar by order dated 9.7.1980 passed in V.P. Case No. 210/80 leased out balance area of 1.37 acres out of 1.54 acres of land in favour of A. Majid and 7 others for the year 1387 B.S. leasing an area of.09 acres each to A. Majid and 5 others and an area of 16 acres each in favour of Mrs. Ayesha Begum and 2 others and rest area of 17 acres in favour of Mrs. Rabeka Islam and then the above lessees having property and then Mr. A. Jalial Magistrate who was instructed to execute the eviction order fixed 28.11.1980 to evict the unauthorized persons form the vested property but in the meantime Mr. Rukunuddin Ahmed and others filed objection stating that they are the owners of the property by purchase from the S.A recorded owners Jogesh and Mrinalini and their power attorney holders. As clear at the end of the above report recommen­dation was made to bring the case under V. P Organization as Jogesh and Mrinalini left for India before 1965 and also that Jogesh and Mrinalini on 12.10.1976 vide deed No.19643 appointed Dr. Mahfuzul Hoque and Md. Forbad Khandaker and subsequently the same was can­celled vide deed NO. 133 dated 9.02.1978 but the above power of attorney holders sold out an area of .25 acres of lands from the said Plot No. 24 on 1.12. 1978 to one Mahmoda Begum wife of Md. Sona Mina Vide Deed No. 2573 i.e. after the cancellation of the power of attorney.<br/><br/>15. The writ petitioners claimed that on the strength of the transfer deeds, the clearance cer­tificate being Memo No. 4818 dated 28.11.1999 and the appellants being found on physical possession of the case land, their names were mutated vide orders in different mutation cases and in process subsequently R.S. records also have been prepared in their favour.<br/><br/>16. The contents of the above certificate dated 28.11.1999 which have been annexed as Annexure-B in both the writ petitioners are as follows:-<br/>Government of Bangladesh Office of the Deputy Commissioner, Dacca<br/>(Revenue Division)<br/>Memo No. 4818 V.P. Dated 28-11-78.<br/>To: The Circle Officer (Rev), Tejgaon, Dacca.<br/>Sub: - Clearance Certificate for Mutation and Separation.<br/>Ref: - His Memo No. 598 dated 19.10.78.<br/>The relevant registers and records have been consulted with land it was found that the property in question (S.A. Plot No. 24 under S.A. Khatian No. 171 of Mouza Paikpara under PS. Tejgaon, Dhaka covering area of .2640 acre of land) has neither been enlisted nor lease out to any body on vacated property.<br/>Sd-Illegible<br/>For Add. Deputy Commissioner, Dacca.<br/>28.11.78.<br/><br/>17. It further appears on 13.05.2004 the appellants filed an application praying for acceptance of supplementary paper book in the present appeals on the ground that the papers annexed there not being in the hands of the appellants at the time of preparation of paper books, could not be furnished in the paper books and in the above application it was stated that the Sub Division Officer, Sadar, Dhaka vide order dated 29.11.1980 directed the Office of the Circle Officer (Rev), Tejgaon Circle, Dhaka to hold enquiry and furnish report as to whether the property in question was vested and non resident property and then the Circle Officer (Rev) after holding local enquiry sub­mitted report vide his Memo No. 266/1107/81 dated 17.04.81 and the contents of the above report which was annexed with the above appli­cation are as follows.<br/>To the S.D.O Sadar Dacca.<br/>Memo No. 266/111-7/81 dated 17.04.81 Rukunuddin Ahmed and 7 others against Misc. Case No. 16/80 and V.P. case No. 210/80.<br/>Ref: His office Memo, No. 1166 (En) V.P. dated 3.12.1280.<br/>In compliance with the memo under refer­ence, I hold a local inquiry perused the docu­mentary evidence adduced by the party, exam­ined the relevant records of this office and found the fact in ut-in-fro:-<br/>The plot No. 24 with a total acre of 1.54 acres stands recorded in S.A. Khatian No. 171 of Mouza Paikpara, J.L 237 in the names of (a) Jogesh Chandra Sarker (b) Begum Sultana Jahan(C) Anwara Hoque (d) Mrinalini Sarker and (e) Torap Ali. Accordingly to share Jogesh Chandra Sarker and his wife Mrinalini Sarker were the owner of 1.04 acres of land of the aforesaid plot. Jogesh Chandra Sarker and Mrinalini Sarker sold their entire property to the petitioners by virtue of different deeds. On the strength of the transfer deeds, clearance certifi­cate issued by the Additional Deputy Commissioner (rev) Dacca vide his memo No. 4818 V.P. dated 28.11,78 and physical posses­sion of the lands in question the names of the petitioners have been mutated vide orders in different mutation cases. In process R.S. record appears to have been prepared in favour of the predecessors of the petitioners. The petitioners are in peaceful possession of the lands in ques­tion by constructing pucca and semi pucca buildings on the lands.<br/>In view of the above facts and circum­stances the question of enlisting the proper­ty in question as vested and non resident property does not arise V.P. Case No. 210 of 1980 may kindly be dropped if no legal bar.<br/>Sd. Illegible<br/>Circle Officer (Rev.) Tejgaon, Dhaka."<br/><br/>18. In the above application dated 13.05.2004 it was further stated that in pursuance to the aforementioned report the Superintendent V.P. and S.D.O. Sadar also rec­ommended for dropping the proceeding for enlisting the case land as vested and non resi­dent property and the contents of the above rec­ommendation, which was also annexed in the above application are as follows:-<br/>"2.5.81 as per order dt. 29.11.80. The C.O. (Rev) Tejgaon submitted report in a separate sheet vide his memo. No 266/111-7/81 dt. 17.4.81 may kindly be seen. It appears from the report that the property in question does not come under preview of vested property and the C.O. (Rev), has recommended dropping the case land from the proceedings.”<br/>Sd-/Illegible<br/><br/>19. However as it appears in the report dated 8.2.84 the earlier report dated 17.1.81 and recommendation given on 11.5.81 as quoted earlier were suppressed and recommendation was made to bring the property of Jogesh and Mrinalini under the control of V.P. organization taking the ground That Jogesh and Mrinalini left India before 1965 without transfer there property to any one and also taking the ground that they executed registered power of attorney on 12.10.76 in favour of Dr Mafizul Haque and Mr. Forhad Khondaker which was subsequent­ly cancelled on 9.2.78 but even after the above cancellation some transfer was made but in that case question may arises if Jogesh and Mrinalini went to India before 1965 how they would execute the power of attorney dated 12.10.76 and cancel it on 9.2.78.<br/><br/>20. Regarding service of notice before evic­tion on 5.8.99 as it appears by Circular No. 1A-1/77/156 R.L. dated 23<sup>rd</sup> May, 1977 instruc­tions were issued directing the concerned offi­cials that enemy properties in relation to lands and buildings vested in the Government under the Enemy Property (Continuance of emer­gency Provisions) (Repeal) Act, 1974 (XLV of 1974), as amended by the Enemy Property (Continuance of Emergency Provisions) (Repeal) Amendment) Ordinance, 1976 (Ordinance XIII of 1976) shall be adminis­tered, controlled, managed and disposed of in the manner as laid down therein and Instruction 7 provides as follows:-<br/>"If any Vested property is found in unlawful possession of any person, the Sub Divisional officer under whose jurisdiction such property is situated, shall issue notice on the person in unlawful possession to show cause within a period not exceeding 7 days as to why he will not be elected there from and after giving the person an opportu­nity of being heard, may enforce sur­render of such property. For this pur­pose the Sub-Divisional officer may use or cause to be used such force as may be necessary."<br/>21. But in their affidavits in opposition the respondents though stated that notices were served before eviction but<br/>no particulars what­soever of such notices were given and there is also no mention as to how and then and upon whom notices were issued or served. In the affi­davit in opposition dated 11.5.2000 filed in Writ Petition No. 3002 of 1999 the respondents how­ever stated that by Memo dated 15.7.99 notice of eviction was served but the said Memo was not annexed with the affidavit in opposition to show upon whom and when those were issued or served. Moreover in the impugned Memo dated 29.7.99 there is no mention at all of the fact that notices were issued upon the tres­passers and in spite of such notices they failed to vacate the case land and so they are to be evict­ed forcibly on 5.8.1999 at 11 A M.<br/><br/>22. However it appears the respondents in their affidavits in opposition though on the one hand took the stand that the appellants nor their representatives were in possession of the case land for last 21 years prior to eviction but at the same time stated that since the case land was declared as vested property, the appellants did not get any title on the basis of their purchases. But as it appears in the supplementary affidavit dated 8.5.2000 filed in Writ Petition No. 3002 of 1999 there are details regarding recording the name of the appellants in hal khatians title on the basis of their possession before eviction. Moreover in cause title of both the writ petitions, the writ petitioners showed that they were evicted from their land of Plot No. 24 (Hal No. 30) C.S. Khatian No. 209 S.A. Khatian No. 171 and 117. D.P. Khatian No. 60 J.L. No. 237 (New 98) Mouza- Paikpara PS Mirpur, District Dhaka covering 8 kathas and 17 kathas of land respectively and moreover in the supplementary affidavit dated 8.5.2000 filed given which tend to show that the appellants being found in possession of the case land on the basis of valid transfers the proceedings for enlisting the case land as vested property was dropped and subsequently the case land was declared as vested property on the basis of recommendation as made by report dated 8.2.84 in V.P. Case No. 210 of 1980 in which the earlier reports and rec­ommendation were not mentioned.<br/><br/>23. In the case of <strong><em>Nittya Gopal Roy Barman vs. Pran Gopal Nandi and others, 32 DLR 11</em></strong> it was held that "mere claim of the Assistant cus­todian that the property of the deceased testator is an enemy property in respect of which an enemy property case was started in 1978 is not sufficient for coming to a conclusion that the property is an enemy property."<br/><br/>24. In the case of <strong><em>Lazmi Kanta Roy vs. Upazila Nirbahi Officer and another 46 DLR 136</em></strong> question arose whether the institution of the VP Case No. 142 of 1980 was maintainable in the eye of law. The High Court Division consid­ering that the Defense of Pakistan Ordinance and Rules came in the year 1965 were repealed in the year 1969 but by Ordinance No. 1 of 1969 some of the provisions of the Defence of Pakistan Rules were kept alive and continued and thereafter by Act No. XLV of 1974. The Ordinance No. 1 of 1969 was repealed on 23.3.74 held that after the repeal of Ordinance No.1 of 1969 on 23.03.1974 the authority was not competent to start such vested property pro­ceeding in the eye of law and that the law on Enemy Property itself died with the repeal of Ordinance 1 of 1969 on 23.3.74 by Act XLV of 1974 and accordingly no further vested proper­ty case can be started thereafter on the basis of the law which is already dead and concluded in holding that the starting of the Vested Property Case No. 142 of 1980 is absolutely without jurisdiction and has no legal effect. In <strong><em>ADC (Revenue)</em></strong> <strong><em>Dhaka Vs Md. Mostafa Ali Mridha and others, 48 DLR 193</em></strong> the High Court Division took similar view holding that after the repeal of Vested and Non-Resident Property Ordinance vide Ordinances No. 92 of 1976 there was no scope for Starting any VP case under the provisions of the aforesaid law afresh and if any proceeding is started for treating a property as vested prop­erty, under law that will be absolutely without jurisdiction. In the case of <strong><em>Artoti Rani Paul Vs. Sudarshan Kumar Paul and others, 56 DLR (AD) 11</em></strong> this Division in the back ground of the law as regards Vested Property at different times held that since the law of enemy property itself died with the repeal of Ordinance No. 1 of 1969 on 23.3.1974 no further vested property case can be started thereafter on the basis of the law which is already dead. This Division in the above case approved the principle of law laid down in <strong><em>46 DLR 136</em></strong>.<br/><br/>25. Accordingly there is no basis at all to treat the case land as vested property upon starting V.P. Case No. 210 of 1980. As stated earlier in the affidavits in opposi­tion filed by the respondents and on the report dated 8.2.84 it was stated that A. Majid and 7 others were granted lease of the case land but there is nothing on record to show that A. Majid and 7 others got the possession of case land and paid the lease money and the fact of payment of lease money at a time for the peirod between 1387 upto 1406 by Mr. Habibur Rahman Khan and 31 others supports the case of the appellants that their names were mutated in the year 1978 and since then they had been in possession of the case land through their representatives and it is only on 5.8.1999 that they were forcibly evicted from the case land by police force in furtherance of the Memo dated 29.7.1999.<br/><br/>26. Accordingly even if for arguments sake it is conceded that notices were served, but even then in the facts and circumstances of the pres­ent case such forcible eviction can not be sus­tained.<br/><br/>27. In the case of <strong><em>M.M Ispahani Vs. Deputy Custodian, 20 DLR 493</em></strong> wherein the writ petitioner challenged the notice dated 31.5.1965 by which the Custodian, Enemy Property directed the Writ petitioner to surren­der the possession of holding No. 187, Imamgonj PS. Kotowali, Chittagong on the ground that he was an unauthorized occupant of the holding the High Court Division held that any person in occupation of a property which is declared to be an enemy property cannot, in general, be said to be in unlawful possession thereof only because the property has been declared to be enemy property and that the pos­session of an occupier of enemy property to be termed as unlawful will depend upon facts of each case and but upon a consideration of the facts pertaining to a case if it is found that the person in occupation of enemy property had no legal authority to inter into the same or that hav­ing entered lawfully into it his lawful posses­sion has been intervened by a lawful order which makes his subsequent possession i.e., the possession subsequent to such a lawful order, unauthorised, then and then alone the person occupying the enemy property can be said to be in unlawful possession thereof. The High Court Division further held that the Custodian, there­fore, if he does not want a person in occupation of a property to continue in possession which has vested in him on it being declared enemy property cannot ask him to  quit except in accordance with law. In the case of a person occupying an enemy property where in he entered legally and of which he is in legal pos­session cannot be notice under section 5 of the Order is contemplated in a case where there has been proof of the fact that the person occupying the enemy property is in fact unlawful possession thereof and can legitimately be termed as an unauthorised occupier and that if upon proof of the facts it is found that the occupier of the enemy property is in lawful possession thereof, and then if the Custodian wants him to quit, then he must follow the provisions of law that pertains to the subject.<br/><br/>28.  In the present appeals the appellants were in possession of the case land on the basis of registered kabala. In the case of <strong><em>Haji SK. Md. Lutfur Rahman Vs. Chairman, Court of Settlement Bangladesh Abandoned Buildings and another, 45 DLR (AD) 136</em></strong> the Writ peti­tioner in the Settlement Court challenged the enlistment of his house in "Kha" list of aban­doned buildings and the Court of Settlement dismissed the case holding that kabala dated 21.8.1987 was availed and the petitioner then moved the High Court Division in Writ jurisdic­tion but the same was dismissed summarily and the Appellate Division remanded the case back to the settlement court holding that a registered document carries with it a presumption of valid­ity and that such presumption is a rebuttable presumption.<br/><br/>29. It thus appears that the respondents at the instance of interested quotes going beyond all norms with the help of police force evicted the appellants from the case land in a high handed manner and as it appears the High Court Division on grounds of ‘'claims of title" and "disputed question of facts." which were not at all required to be resolved in the above writ petitioners, discharged the Rules and accord­ingly the decision of High Court division is liable, to be set aside.<br/>Accordingly the appeals are allowed with cost in all stages. The respondents are directed to comply the court's order within 4(four) months from receipt of the judgment<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
