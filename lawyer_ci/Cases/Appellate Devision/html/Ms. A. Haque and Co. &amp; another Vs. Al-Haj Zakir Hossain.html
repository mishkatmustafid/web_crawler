Plaintiff- respondent instituted Other Suit No. 3 of 1974 in the 1st court of Subordinate Judge Chittagong for recovery of arrear rents as monthly tenants in respect of the suit premises. The case of the plaintiff-respondent is that the appellants took rent of the premises at the rate of Tk. 350/- pay­able according to English calender month. As the ap­pellant stopped payment of rents on and from the month of April, 1973 and paid no heed to demands of the respondent and caused damage to the premises by removing water pipes, fittings, fixtures, etc. the respondent issued notice on November 3, 1973 termi­nating the appellant tenancy with the expiry of the last day of November, 1973. Notice was received by the appellants on November 7, 1973 but as the ap­pellants did not vacate the premises, respondent filed the present suit.<br/><br/>3. Defendant-appellants contested the suit by fil­ing a written statement. Their contentions were that they took lease of the premises in the month of June, 1971 and according to an oral agreement re­spondent used to collect rent of several months to­gether and grant receipts ante-dating them month wise. Defendant appellants never failed to pay rents to the respondents' representative who came to col­lect the same. Defendant-appellants never stopped payment of rents from April, 1973. It was not true that the respondent's rent collector went to the appel­lants during the later part of October, 1973 for col­lection of rents when defendant appellant No.2 showed him temper or said that rent should be paid when they desired. There was no talk on agreement for payment of rent every month. Plaintiff- respondent did not serve any notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act determining the tenancy or demanding rents. Defendant-appellants did not receive any notice from the plaintiff-respondent by registered post or under certificate of posting on November 7, 1973 or any other date.<br/><br/>4. Defendant-appellants' further case was that the plaintiff-respondent collected rents for 9 months, against August 1971 to April 1972, from the defendant- appellants who paid the same by one pay order. Plaintiff respondent granted receipts for the same. Similarly, plaintiff- respondent collected rents from May, 1972 to December, 1972 by one cheque dated 4.12.72. Plaintiff-respondent received the rent of April, 1973 by Cheque No.505173 dated 6.5.73 on Pubali Bank, College Branch which was received by plaintiff-respondent's son Nurul Islam who signed the counter foil. Thereafter none ap­proached the defendant-appellants for rent but to­wards the second week of July, 1973 plaintiff-respondent demanded enhancement of rent which the defendant-appellants did not accept.<br/><br/>5. Defendant-appellants offered rents for May and June, 1973 by pay Order No. A022932/26/ 2327 dated 12.7.73 on Rupali Bank, Khatunganj Branch, Chittagong which the plaintiff- respondent refused to accept. Defendant-appellants remitted rents of these two, months by postal money order on 19 July, 1973 which was returned back to him on 28 July, 1973. Defendant-appellants then deposited the rents with the House Rent Controller in H. R. C. Case No. 208 of 1973. Since then defendant-appellants have been regularly depositing the rents with the House Rent Controller and hence they are not defaul­ters and not liable to be evicted. The suit was decreed by the trial court but on appeal it was dismissed by the first appellate Court Plaintiff-respondent, how­ever, succeeded before the High Court Division which set aside the judgment of the first appellate court and restored that of the trial court.<br/><br/>6. Being aggrieved the defendant-appellants ob­tained leave from this Court to consider whether the High Court Division was wrong in not holding that the contract as mentioned in sub-section (5) of sec­tion 18 of the Premises Rent Control Ordinance may be oral or written and that the defendant-appellants proved the oral contract regarding collec­tion of rents by the plaintiff-respondent according to his convenience. Further, whether the withdrawal of rents by the plaintiff-respondent during the pendency of the suit from the account of the House Rent Con­trol case constituted a waiver of the plaintiff-respondent's alleged notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act.<br/><br/>7. Point involved for determination is whether the defendant-appellants being monthly tenants de­faulted in payment of rent as laid down in section 18(5) of the Premises Rent Control Ordinance, 1963. This sub-section, as will be seen, requires a monthly tenant to pay rent in the absence of any contract to the contrary by the 15th day of the month following the month for which rent has be­come due. Section 18(5) of the Ordinance runs as follows:<br/>"(5) No tenant shall be entitled to the benefit of this section in respect of any premises unless, he pays the rent due by him in respect of such premises to the full extent allowable by this Or­dinance within the time fixed in the contract with his landlord or, in the absence of such con­tract, by the fifteenth day of the month next fol­lowing that for which the rent is payable, or in the cases provided for in section 19, unless the tenant has deposited such rent or any subsequent. rent in respect of such premises as provided in that section together with, in the case men­tioned in clause (b) of sub-section(I) of that sec­tion, the cost of transmission referred to in that clause within the time specified in that section".<br/><br/>8. From the evidence it appears that the defendant-appellants have on various occasions paid rents for at a time. There is no controver­sy regarding such lump sum payments of rent. What is, however, important notice about such payments is that while granting receipts for them the plaintiff-respondent took care in giving such receipts month wise. A question is, do the facts constitute an evidence of a contract between the parties waiving the right to receive rent within the 15th day follow­ing the month for which rent has become due. Secondly, even if it does whether sub-section (5) of sec­tion 18 of the Ordinance contemplates this kind of contract or an oral agreement. On referring to the precise provisions of this sub-section it is seen that the expressions used therein are" within the time <u>fixed in the contract</u> or by the 15th day of the month next following that for which the rent is payable." The portions underlined by me refer to the existence of the contract between the landlord and the tenant. From the use of the preposition "in" before the ex­pressions “the contract," the intention of the legis­lature seems to be clear. There might have been some scope for controversy if the preposition 'by' was used instead of the preposition 'in'. As it is, the contract referred to here in this sub-section means a written counteract, and not an oral contract. The or­dinance lays down the deadline for rents to be paid by a tenant, that is," by the 15th day of the month next following that for which the rent is payable." If this time-limit has to be varied by a landlord and his ant, it obviously implies something in writing, which is not the case here. Moreover, defendant-appellants tried to establish the so called contract by referring to the practice of the parties of payment of rent in lump-sum amount and the acceptance of the one by the landlord at a time. It has been pointed by the respondent's Counsel that though there has been lump-sum payments and receipts, the plaintiff-respondent never accepted such lump-sum amounts by granting one receipt. Receipts issued by the plaintiff-respondent show that they were issued month wise, that is, one receipt for one month and tie date of granting each receipt was put within the month before the before the 15th day of the following month. The learned Counsel further submitted that the regular payment of lump-sum rents for several months at a time and the receipts thereof granted in the afore­said manner did not create any express or implied contract varying the deadline of payment of rents by a monthly tenant as provided in the Ordinance, nor did such conduct constitute a waiver of the respondent- landlords right to receive rents by the 15th day of the month next following that for which the rent is payable. In the absence of any contract and also on the failure of the defendant- appellants to prove the existence of an oral contract between the parties to the effect that the respondent would collect rents for several months at a time according to his con­venience the defendant-appellants must be held to be defaulters within the meaning of the terms used in sub-section (5) of section 18 of the Ordinance.<br/><br/>9. According to him, the deposit of rents for the months of May and June, 1973 with the House Rent Controller on August 7, 1973 after making an offer on July 19, 1973 by money order cannot save defendant-appellants from being defaulters within the meaning of the aforesaid sub-section.<br/><br/>10. The law as to when a tenant would become be deemed to be a defaulter as provided in the Ordinance has already been considered by us quite elab­orately in the following decisions, namely<em>, </em><strong><em>Ramjan Ali Mistry V. Md. Hedayetullah,(1979) 3 and Profulla Kumar Chakrovarty V. Anil Prasad Chowdhury, (1981) 33 DLR 55 AD.</em></strong> There is neither any vagueness in neither the law itself nor the interpretation put upon it by this Court. The consequence of a tenant becoming a defaulter has also been clearly laid down in our decisions. In the present case a question as to whether the time limit for payment of rents as fixed in the statute itself can be varied ex­cept in accordance with a written contract has been canvassed before us. Appellants' Counsel has tried here to establish that such variation can be made by an oral contract and secondly, an oral contract can be proved by the subsequent conduct of the landlord and tenant. Paying and receiving rent in the aforesaid manner, in the present case according to him, showed the existence of such an oral contract. On the other hand, respondent's Counsel has made pointed submissions as to the true interpretation of the aforesaid sub-section. His contentions are in line with the express language of the sub-section and the conduct of the plaintiff-respondent in granting month wise receipts show that he understood the provisions of the aforesaid sub-section in the right manner.<br/><br/>11. As to whether there was any oral contract between the plaintiff-respondent and the defendant-appellants for realising rents of several months at a time no evidence other than irregular payment of rents for several months at a time by the appellants and receipt of the same by the respondent was forth­coming. In his cross-examination P.W.1, categori­cally denied that there was ever any understanding with the defendant to such effect. The learned Coun­sel for the respondent submitted that it did not re­quire any mentioning as to the non-existence of any express contract varying the requirements as to the payment of rent as laid down in sub-section (5) of section 18 of the Act. No implied contract either can be said to have been created simply by the fact of payment and acceptance of rents for several months at a time. Such irregular payment did not also con­stitute a waiver of the right to receive rents as laid down in the aforesaid sub-section. In the absence of any contract as provided in sub-section (5) of section 18 of the Act which, in our opinion, must invaria­bly be a written contract, the date for the payment of rent, as fixed in sub-section (5) of section 18 of the Act is the 15th day of the month next following that for which the rent is payable. As the defendant- appellants have not succeeded in proving that there was such a written contract or that rents for the months of May and June were paid within such time as mentioned in the aforesaid sub-section they have become defaulters and cannot escape eviction. Any subsequent deposit of such rents with the House Rent Controller cannot enable them to overcome the mischief arising from their default<br/>For the reasons stated above, the appeal is dis­missed without any order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
