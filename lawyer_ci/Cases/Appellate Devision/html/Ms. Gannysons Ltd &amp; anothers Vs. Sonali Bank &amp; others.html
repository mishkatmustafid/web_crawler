In brief, the facts of the case are that the Sonali Bank, respondent No. 1, obtained a decree in Title Suit No. 249 of 1976 for foreclosure and sale of the mortgaged pro­perties belonging to the appellant company and put it into execution in Title Execution No. 46 of 1980. Appellant-company appeared before the Court and prayed for staying the execution of the decree on the grounds that since the Bank proceeded against the appel­lant Company's properties being treated as abandoned by the Government, the Directors pf the appellant Company were not properly served with notice and that had, therefore, no knowledge of the aforesaid title suit. As a result, they did not appear in the suit. Also the Government which was made a party did not take any steps. However, on the prayer of the appellant Company the proceeding in the execution case was stayed till October 20, 1981. In Writ Petition No. 720 of 1981 a Rule was issued at the instance of the appe­llant company on October 20, 1981. But it abated on 24 March 1982 after the Proclama­tion of Martial Law.<br/><br/>3.  In Miscellaneous Case No. 958 of 1981 which was filed by the appellant Company under section 47 of the Code of Civil  Pro­cedure its prayer against the execution of the decree obtained in Title Suit No. 249 of 1976 was disallowed by the Court. The appellant Company's appeal against this order was dis­missed by the High Court Division on 9 November 1982. The appellant Company, being aggrieved, moves this Court and succee­ded in having the appeal against the order of the trial Court rejecting their objection under section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure allowed.<br/><br/>4. Appellant's grievance is not against the tenor of the judgment in Civil Appeal No. 43 of 1983 which is in their favour but they raised objection against the concluding paragraph of the judgment which is as follows:<br/>"Decree dated 27-3-80 passed by the Subordinate Judge, 3rd Court, Dhaka in Title Suit No. 249 of 1976 be stayed for six months and the Miscellaneous Case No. 958 of 1981 pending in the 3rd court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka be struck down."<br/><br/>5. This order, according to them, is not in conformity with the judgment itself. The only ground taken by the appellant against the judgment is as follows:<br/>"For that consistently with the rea­sonings in the main body of the judgment and the decision allowing the appeal (C.A. No. 43 of 1983) arising out of Miscellaneous Case No. 958 of 1981 started under section 47 C.P.C. (at the instance of M/S. Gannysons Ltd. and another) the Title Execution Case No. 46 of 1980 pending in the 3rd Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka, needs to-be struck down and the said Miscella­neous Case No. 958 of 1981 of the same court allowed and that the order staying the decree dated 27.3.80  Title Suit No. 279 of 1976 of the 3rd Court of the Subordinate  Judge  needs to be deleted."<br/><br/>6. Mr. T.H, Khan, Counsel for the peti­tioners, submitted that the proper order should have been striking down of the Title Execution Case No. 6 of 1980 and allowing the Miscellaneous Case No. 958 of 1981, both pending in the 3rd Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka and that the last paragraph: of the judgment which has been quoted above should, therefore, be altogether deleted.<br/><br/>7. As against these submissions by the petitioners' Counsel, Mr. Asrarul Hossain, Counsel for the Bank, submitted that the operative part, staying the decree for 6 months was in order since time was given to the peti­tioners to get a release order from the Go­vernment. Since the debt is admitted there is no escape from repayment of the same. As the properties were treated as abandoned, Government had no objection in repaying the loan obtained by Gannysons Ltd. and even if the company and its properties are released by the Government, the Company which had obtained the loan before being treated as abandoned would have to pay up the decretal amount. In either case the Bank has nothing to lose, but the petitioners' stake will be very high if the decree in question is allowed to be put into execution.<br/><br/>8. The main contentions seem to be not so much over the liability to repay the debt obtained by Gannysons Ltd. before it was treated as abandoned, but over who is to repay the same, the Government of Gannysons Ltd. which is now claiming that it, being a company registered in Dhaka, neither itself nor its properties could have been treated as abandoned by the Government under the provisions of P.O. No.16 of 1982. On the settlement of this contention lies the solution and remedy of the appellant-petitioners.<br/><br/>9. On these contentions. Court granted leave to hear the petition for review against its judgment in Civil Appeal No. 43 of 1983 disposed of in August 1983. On 14 March, 1984 Civil Appeal No. 43 of 1983 along with Civil Review Petition No. 2 of 1984 came up for final hearing before this Court. The hearing of the appeal and the review petition was, however, adjourned   on that date for ten days and after two more adjournments on 27 March 1984 and 30 April, 1984 when the appeal came up for hearing on 20 June 1984 the Additional Attorney-General was directed to put in an affidavit within four weeks, stating as to how the property in question was declared an abandoned property and Mr. T.H. Khan, Counsel for the appe­llants was allowed to put in an affidavit-in-reply within one week thereafter. On 25 July 1984 the appellant was allowed further 7 (seven) days' time to file an affidavit in reply and the respondents were allowed to put in an affidavit-in-reply within three days thereafter. On 9 August 1984 the appeal was adjourned to 19 August 1984.<br/><br/>10.  When the review petition along with the appeal was being adjourned from time to time on the prayer of the Counsel of the appellants and respondents, the Court was surprised to know that the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 have, in order to satisfy the decretal dues of Tk. 11,32,752.52, given a cheque for the sum of Tk. 5,71,067 in favour of respondent No.1, the Sonali Bank, on 29 March 1984 and another cheque for payment of the remaining amount of Tk. 5,61,685.33 to the Sonali Bank on 20 April,1984. It is not understood how or why respondent Nos. 2 and 3 became so prompt in putting the decretal dues to the Bank all on a sudden when the entire dispute has been pending for final settlement before this Court. In its judgment in Civil Appeal No.43 of 1983 though this Court did not finally deter­mine the question whether the property in dispute belonging to the appellant as aban­doned property or not, there was clear indi­cation therein that the same could not be declared as abandoned property. It was also clearly stated in the judgment that even if the property could be treated by the Government as abandoned property under the provisions of P.O. No. 16 of 1972 respondent No. 1, Sonali Bank, had equally failed to show how the decree obtained in Title Suit No. 249 of 1976 could be executed in respect of such properties which had vested in the Govern­ment under the provisions of P.O. 16 of 1972.<br/>This Court also observed that—<br/>"It is also difficult to understand why, if the loan was obtained by M/S. Gannysons Ltd. before it was treated as aban­doned properties, the Bank, instead of proceeding against the Directors   of the company who continued till it was declared as abandoned, it proceeded against it when it came to be treated as aban­doned property by the Government. The Bank wanted to proceed against the properties which were offered as secu­rity against the loan obtained by the appellants before it was treated as aban­doned property but in all fairness the Bank should have, made them parties as well as the Government and should have sought relief against them, parti­cularly when the previous Directors were persistently pursuing their reme­dies for the release of the properties in question."<br/><br/>11. In view of the above circumstances the-payments in cheques as aforesaid stated to be in satisfaction of the decretal dues seem to be in disregard of the Court's judg­ment, particularly when the whole matter has been opened up by granting of leave by this Court in Civil Review Petition No. 2 of 1984 and this Court being in seisin of the matter.      <br/><br/>12. Mr. Asrarul Hossain, Counsel for the Sonali Bank, while realising the actual position which arose out of the payments by cheques of the decretal dues by respondent Nos. 2 and 3, submitted that the cheques were not cashed by the Bank but had been kept in the suspense account of the Bank pending final order by this Court. He further sub­mitted that the Bank will abide by whatever order or orders will be passed by this Court, as it has nothing to lose, it being immaterial whether the decretal dues are paid by res­pondent Nos. 2 and 3 or the appellant. What the Sonali Bunk is concerned with is the satisfaction of the decree obtained by it in the aforesaid suit in respect of the outstan­ding dues of the loan obtained by Gannysons Limited.<br/><br/>13. As regards the question whether the property in dispute in respect of which the decree has been obtained by the Bank is abandoned property or not the Court went through the affidavit-in-Reply put in by the appellant. Having gone through these affida­vits and after hearing the arguments of the learned Counsel for the appellant and the Additional Attorney-General, we are of the view that neither Gannysons Ltd. nor prop­erties belonging to it fall within the definition of abandoned property as given in Abandoned Property (Management, Control and Dis­posal) Order, 1972 (P.O. No 16 of 1972).<br/><br/>14. Appellant has already suffered and to compel itself to further litigation in the form of a suit for declaration that the pro­perties in question were not abandoned property would result not only in further harassment but as the settlement of the question in such an independent suit will take long years leading to swelling of the decretal dues as well as deprivation of the enjoyment of the properties in question we think that there should be an end to further litigation.<br/><br/>15. The definition of abandoned property as given in the Act itself (i.e. P.O. No. 16 of 1972) is as follows:<br/>"2. In this Order, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context,<br/>(1) "abandoned property" means any property owned by any person who is not present in Bangladesh or whose whereabouts are not known or who has ceased to occupy, supervise or manage in person his property including—<br/>(i) any property owned by any person who is a citizen of a State which a any time after the 25th day of March, 1971, was at war with or engaged in military operations against the People's Republic of Bangladesh;<br/>(ii) Any property taken over under the Bangladesh (Taking over of Control and Management of Industrial and Com­mercial Concerns) Order, 1972 (Acting President's Order No. 1 of 1972), but does not include-<br/>(a) Any property the owner of which is residing outside Bangladesh for any purpose which, in the opinion of the Government, is not prejudicial to the interest of Bangladesh;<br/>(b) Any property which is in the posse­ssion or under the control of the Govern­ment under any law for the time being in force.<br/><strong>Explanation.—</strong> "Person who is not present in Bangladesh" includes anybody of persons or company constituted or incorporated in. the territory or under the laws of a State which at any time after the 25th day of March, 1971, was at war with or engaged in military operations against the People's Republic of Bangladesh:<br/>(2) "Company" includes a banking com­pany and insurance company;<br/>(3) "Government" means the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh;<br/>(4) "Prescribed" means prescribed by any rule, order or direction made or given in pursuance of any of the provisions of this Order;<br/>(5) "Property" means property of any kind, movable or immovable and includes any right or interest in such property and any debt or an actionable claim, any security or negotiable instrument, any right under a contract and any indu­strial or commercial undertaking."<br/><br/>16. According to this definition, since Gannysons Limited Company under the provi­sions of the Company Act in the territory now comprising Bangladesh, it can, in no circumstances, be declared as an abandoned property, the presence of a such juristic person in Bangladesh at the relevant time or at any time thereafter cannot be nega­tived by any extraneous consideration.<br/>Moreover, as already seen, the Directors of Gannysons Limited has always been in Bangladesh, and even those who were temporarily outside the country returned to Bangladesh long ago. As regards invoking the provisions of the abandoned property Order (P.O. No. 16 of 1972) the appellants had been able to establish their sincere efforts to get back the release of their property which was unjustly declared as an abandoned property from the very beginning, but without any result so far.<br/><br/>17. In view of the circumstances above and in virtue of the power conferred upon this Court by the Constitution of Bangladesh, <em>vide</em> Article 104, to do complete justice in a case it is declared that Gannysons Limited is not an abandoned property, it should, therefore, be  immediately released. Along with the release of Gannysons Limited any of its pro­perties, assets and capital should also be released and returned to it.<br/><br/>18. The review is allowed. It is hereby declared that the property is not aban­doned property. Appellant will pay the de­cretal amount to Sonali Bank. Respondent-Government will release the property within 4 (four) weeks from today and thereafter within two weeks the appellant will pay the decretal amount to Sonali Bank directly and on pay­ment the Title Execution Case No. 46 of 1980 pending in she 3rd court of Subordinate Judge,  Dhaka will be struck down. The respondent Sonali Bank will return the amount held by them in the suspense account to the Government and the suit filed by the appellant being T.S. No. 508 of 1982 being infructuous will be withdrawn after release of the property within the aforesaid date. No costs.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
