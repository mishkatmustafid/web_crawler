Joynul Abedin J. - </strong>These four appeals by leave are directed against the common judgment and order dated 09.08.1999 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Writ Petition Nos.5392 of 1996 and 576 of 1998 making both the rules absolute.<br/><br/>2. The respondents as writ petitioners filed Writ Petition Nos. 5392 of 1996 and 576 of 1198 challenging the proceeding of Land Acquisition Case No.1 of 1990-91 in so far it relates to the acquisition of property of the writ petitioners of Mouza Ozar Bhanga, J.L.No.165, Police Station-Daudkandi, Comilla comprising 2.50 acres of Plot Nos. 342 and 381 being the subject matter of Writ Petition No.5392 of 1976 and Plot No. 380 being the subject matter of Writ Petition No.576 of 1998 hereinafter called the case land as without lawful authority and for a direction on the writ-respondent appellants to drop the said proceeding.<br/><br/>3. The Common case of the writ petitioners is that the Government has already acquired their other lands for the construction of Dhaka-Chittagong High Way and they are only left with the case land in the which they wanted to develop for the purpose of setting up of their own industry. If the case land is acquired they will be thrown out on to the street. The writ respondent No.5, M/s. Molla Industrial Estate, on the other hand has 3.49 acres of land in the vicinity of the case land on the other side of Dhaka-Chittagong High Way. Despite this the writ-respondent No.5 without setting up its aforesaid industry on its own land managed the case land to be acquired for setting up its industry by influencing the local administration. Although the case land is shown in paper to have been acquired by the Government and possession handed over to writ-respondent No.5 as the requiring body but in fact the writ petitioners are still in possession of the case land and the same are not taken over and utilised by the writ-respondent No.5. It is also stated that the acquisition of the case land is malafide as the same is caused to have been acquisitioned by the Government for the purpose of setting up of the industry of the writ-respondent No.5 although writ respondent has its own land across the Dhaka-Chittagong High Way within the vicinity of the case land.<br/><br/>4. The writ-respondent No.5 contested the rule issued in both the writ petitions contending that the case land was acquired by the Government to enable the writ-respondent No.5 to set up their export-oriented industry, which was for public purpose, by issuing notice under section 3 of the Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance, 1982 inviting objections from all concerned including the writ petitioners and the Deputy Commissioner, Comilla after due hearing of the objections submitted the record of the proceedings with his opinion to the Divisional Commissioner for his decision. The Divisional Commissioner thereafter on consideration of the said report of the Deputy Commissioner made a decision for acquisition of the case land and the Deputy Commissioner then issued a public notice under section 6 inviting claims for compensation informing all concerned that the Divisional Commissioner took a decision to acquire the case land and would take possession of the same followed by a notice under section 7 for awarding compensation. All concerned received payment of compensation except the writ petitioners who purposely refused to take compensation. Subsequently Gazette notification under section 11 of the Ordinance was published on 31.12.1992 vesting the case land in the Government and thereafter the possession thereof was handed over to the writ-respondent No.5 i.e. the requiring body on 31.12.1991.<br/><br/>5. The High Court Division thereafter on hearing the parties made the rules absolute on the grounds that the acquisition of the case land is not for public purpose, the case land in so far as it belonged to the writ petitioners has not been utilized by the requiring body i.e. the writ respondent No. 5 and the same is still in possession of the writ petitioners and that the acquisition is malafide inasmuch as the case land is managed to have been acquired leaving aside 3.49 acres of land of the writ-respondent No.5 in the vicinity and accordingly the delay in filing the writ petitions under reference shall not prejudicially affect the right of the writ petitioners to have the case land dropped from the said L.A. Case No.1/90-91.<br/><br/>6. Against this backdrop, leave was granted to consider whether the acquisition in question is for public purpose, whether the acquisition of the case land is malafide for procuring acquisition of the case land leaving aside the land of the writ-respondent No.5 situated in the vicinity and whether the delay in filing the aforesaid two writ petitions by the writ petitioners was inordinate and fatal for both the acquiring and the requiring body and thus rendering the writ petitions as not maintainable.<br/><br/>7. We have heard the learned lawyers for both the appellants and respondents in support of their contentions against and in favour of the impugned judgment of the High Court Division.<br/><br/>8. It is noted from the record that the writ respondent No. 5, Molla Industrial Estate, as the requiring body approached the Government and made a proposal for acquisition of land for them to the extent of 2.50 acres at the present site to enable them to set up export-oriented industry and entered into an agreement dated 14.2.1990 in this regard with the Government under section 15 of the Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance, 1982. Consequently the Deputy Commissioner, Comilla published a notice under section 3 proposing to acquire lands mentioned therein including the case land for public purpose to enable the writ respondent No.5 to set up an export-oriented industry inviting objections from the affected persons against such acquisition. The writ petitioners filed objection on 15.7.19990 to the Deputy Commissioner. The Deputy Commissioner thereafter on due hearing of the objections submitted the record of the proceedings held by him to the Divisional Commissioner, Chittagong along with his report for his decision. The Divisional Commissioner thereupon on due consideration of the report together with the objections of the writ petitioners gave his decision in favour of acquisition of the said land as contemplated under section 5 of the said Ordinance after rejecting the objections. The Deputy Commissioner thereafter issued a public notice under section 6 dated 2.3.1991 intimating the said decision of the Divisional Commissioner inviting claims for compensation from all concerned including the writ petitioners.<br/><br/>10. The writ petitioners in response thereto submitted their objection dated 22.10.1991 to the Ministry of Land pointing out for the first time that the writ-respondent No.5 had their own land measuring 3.49 acres across the Dhaka-Chittagong High Way close to the acquired land with a request not to acquire their land. Their objection was rejected on due enquiry. The writ-respondent No.5 thereupon deposited compensation money with the Government as per estimate furnished by the Government and thereafter the Deputy Commissioner arranged for payment of compensation to the affected persons. All concerned received compensation money for their land but the writ petitioners refused to receive compensation for the case land. Accordingly the compensation money has been kept in the public account of the Republic. The case land consequently finally stood acquired and vested in the Government and the Government thereafter handed over possession of the same to the writ-respondent No.5 on 2.12.1991 and the Deputy Commissioner then published a declaration of the acquisition of the case land and other land in the official Gazette on 31.12.1992. The writ petitioners then filed Writ Petition No.5392 of 1996 after 2 years and writ Petition No.576 of 1998 after 7 years of the final vesting of the case land in the Government on publication of the said official Gazette.<br/><br/>11. A property is said to be needed for public purpose or in the public interest when it is acquisitioned in furtherance of the general interest of the community as opposed to the particular interest of the individuals. When the Divisional Commissioner makes a decision for acquisition of a property under section 5(1) of the Ordinance such decision is conclusive evidence that the property is needed for a public purpose or in the public interest. In this view of the legal position and when it could not be established by the writ petitioners that payment of compensation was withheld by the Government after the decision of acquisition of the case land was made or taken by the Divisional Commissioner the proceedings of the said L.A. Case No.1 of 1990-91 shall not abate. The case of <strong><em>Alauddin Khanker (Md.) Vs. Secretary, Ministry of Land and others, 4 BLC (AD) 25</em></strong> may be profitably referred to in this regard.<br/><br/>12. Since in the present case, the case land was finally vested in the Government on publication of the official Gazette under section 11 the filing of the said two writ petitions challenging the acquisition proceeding in question was abortive, ineffectual and meaningless inasmuch as such inordinate delay in filing the writ petitions disentitled the writ petitioners the relief sought for. In fact the writ court erred in entertaining such delayed writ petitions inasmuch as the rights which accrued to the Government and the writ respondent No.5 by reason of such delay were not liable to be disturbed and interfered with case of <strong><em>Bangladesh</em></strong><strong><em> Vs. Golam Azam, 46 DLR (AD)</em> </strong>can be cited on the point.<br/><br/>13. Now the only pertinent question that falls for consideration is whether the acquisition under consideration is malafide. The answer to this question depends on whether the case land was acquisitioned despite the fact that the writ respondent No.5 has sufficient quantum of land in the neighbourhood of the case land. It is already noticed that the writ petitioners did not make this allegation in their written objection to the notices issued under section 3 as well as under section 6 by the Deputy Commissioner. They only made a belated objection on 22.10.1991 in this regard to the Ministry of Land much after the decision was taken by the Divisional Commissioner for acquisition of the case land. Moreover the writ petitioners could not establish the allegation about the existence of any land of the writ-respondent No.5 in or about the vicinity of the acquired land by producing any authentic and official document when the writ respondent No. 5 denied the same. It is therefore clear that the allegation of the malafide acquisition stands disproved. On the other hand, in the face of denial of this allegation by the writ respondent No.5 the writ petitions under reference could be said to have involved disputed question of fact making the writ petitions not maintainable.<br/><br/>14. It is already noticed that the acquisition proceeding in the present case already reached its finality with the case land vested in the Government long before the said writ petitions were filed. Now even after this if the writ respondent No. 5 is allegedly found to have failed to utilize or use the case land for the purpose it was acquired the court can not provide any relief by way of restoration of possession of the case land to the writ petitioners by setting aside the acquisition proceeding which acquisition was long complete and legally made. When any land is otherwise validly acquisitioned such acquisition can not be interfered with except on the ground that the acquisition was malafide and/or compensation for the land was not paid. No such case has been made out by the writ petitioners. In a case where it is established that the requiring body has failed to use or utilize the acquired land for the purpose it was acquired the Government can make the requiring body surrender such land to the Deputy Commissioner and in that case on the application made by the real owners of the land the Government in its discretion may restore possession of such land to them.<br/><br/>In view of the forgoing discussions the appeals are allowed without any order as to costs.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
