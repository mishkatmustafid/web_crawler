The appellant filed the case stating, inter-alia, that the appellant made written bainanama on 31.10.1963 with the original owners for purchase of 16.65 acres of chala land of C.S.Plot Nos.44, 45, 46, 49, 77, 80, 76, 75, 81, 40, 48 and 70 of Ranabhola Mouza presently under the Police Station Uttara at a consideration of TK.46,5000.00 and took over possession. On that basis a regular sale deed (Ext.56 Cha) was executed and registered on 09.05.1969 on receipt of the full consideration money. Thereafter, the appellants raised its entire purchased land and developed it and converted the same into bhiti land. The aforesaid bhiti land with an area of 11.5750 acres of C.S. Plot Nos.45, 46, 48, 49, 70 and 76 along with running 8 industrial units set up by the appellants at a huge cost was purportedly acquired by the respondents under Section 93A of the Town Improvement Act, 1953 in Special L.A. Case No.8 of 1964-65 for setting up a Rehabilitation Zone for rehabilitation of the persons affected by the Scheme of Uttara Model Town. No notice was served on the appellants. Possession of the land was taken over in 1972 after demolition of eight units of running industries thereon. The appellants were paid a amount of TK.1,34,177.00 for the land, TK.8,83,110.78 for the structures and TK.2,913.24 for the trees standing on a portion thereof on the basis of 'provisional estimate on rough and ready calculation as per provisions of Section 93(B) of the Town Improvement Act, 1953'. That the respondents while taking-over physical possession of such a big area of bhiti land after paying a very small amount of money on rough and ready calculation started delaying the process of acquisition for years together in spite of repeated written representations to complete the same and to pay the compensation according to law but in vain. Of late, the appellants were forced to file Writ Petition No.3828 of 1992 before the High Court Division for a direction either to release the land or to complete the process of acquisition early and to pay compensation. After hearing both sides, a direction was given on 02.08.1994 to the respondents to complete the process of acquisition within a period of six months from the date. Even the respondents did not comply with the aforesaid direction. Contempt Petition No.13 of 1995 was started and a proceeding was drawn up against the respondents. By this time the process of acquisition was completed hurriedly by publishing it in the official gazette on 31.08.2000 as contemplated under Section 93A(4)(h) of the Town Improvement Act, 1953 and final award was made on 09.10.2000 by the Deputy Commissioner after about 35 years for a total amount of TK.10,10,257.49 paisa per acre. Thereafter, three separate notices (Ext.46) under Section 7(aa) of the (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act, 1948 were issued asking the appellants to receive the balance amount. The appellants, not being satisfied with the amount of compensation offered on the basis of the aforesaid final award, filed an application before the learned Joint District Judge and Arbitrator, Dhaka as per provisions of Section 7(aaa) of the (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act, 1948. It may be mentioned that under the provisions of Section 93A(5)(b)(I) of the Town Improvement Act, 1953 an aggrieved person may also file similar application to the Arbitrator. In the instant case since the notices for receiving compensation were issued under Section 7(aa) of the (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act, 1948, so the appellants filed the aforesaid application under Section 7(aaa) of the (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act, 1948. Moreover, provisions of both the Acts are pari-materia applicable so far it relates to assessment and payment of compensation. Arbitration Case No.226 of 2000 was started on the said application in which the appellants claimed (a) TK.115,75,00,000.00 as compensation for 11.5750 acres of bhiti land (b) TK. 57,87,50,000.00 as statutory compensation of 50% (c) TK. 3,22,05,000.00 as recurring loss for permanent acquisition (d) TK.  50,00,000.00 for severance cost (e) TK. 80,000.00 for cost of structure (f) TK.2,00,000.00 for trees i.e. in all TK.178,50,16,000.00.<br/><br/>3. The respondent Nos.1 and 2 filed separate written objection denying the claim of the appellants asserting that the final assessment as has been done by the Deputy Commissioner is correct. By judgment and order dated 15.01.2003, the Joint District Judge and Arbitrator allowed TK.4,52,75,612.50 as compensation for 11.5750 bhiti land 15% statutory interest TK. 67,91,341.87 paisa i.e.total TK. 5,20,66,954.37 paisa minus previously taken TK. 1,39,768.12 paisa balance TK. 5,19,27,186.25 paisa. It was submitted before the High Court Division that the Joint District Judge, and Arbitrator while assessing compensation for the appellants' 11.5750 acres of bhiti land after due and proper appreciation of materials on record particularly Ext.53(Ka) by mistake referred chala land in some places and illegally rejected appellants' claim for potential earnings therefrom for the last 35 years amounting to TK. 32,28,000.00 at the rate of TK. 40,00,000.00 per year and (II) severance cost of TK. 50,00,000.00 on the basis of materials on record particularly Ext.56. Besides, the Joint District Judge and the Arbitrator in making final assessment erroneously considered the average value of lands of the period from 1972 to 2000 instead of the period from 1988 to 2000 from such gazette notification.<br/><br/>4. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and award the appellants filed First Miscellaneous Appeal No.229 of 2003 before the High Court Division on 20.04.2003. The respondent No.2 filed a Cross Miscellaneous Appeal No.294 of 2003 against the said judgment and award. Both the appeals were heard together. By judgment and order dated 03.04.2004 the High Court Division, after hearing, dismissed the First Miscellaneous Appeal No.229 of 2003 filed by the appellants and allowed Cross-Miscellaneous Appeal No.294 of 2003 filed by the respondent No.2 with cost and after setting aside the judgment and award of the Joint District Judge and Arbitrator, sent the case back on remand to the Joint District Judge and Arbitrator for assessment of compensation afresh on the basis of value of similar land with similar advantages during 24 months proceeding the date of service of notice on 30.10.1965.<br/><br/>5. Leave was granted to consider the submissions of the learned Counsel for the appellants that "the impugned judgment and order dismissing the appellants' appeals and allowing the respondent No.2's Cross-appeal with cost and sending the case back on remand for assessment of compensation afresh of the acquired land during twenty four months proceeding the date of service of notice on 30.10.1965, is not legal and the same is against the settled principles of law as laid down in the decision reported in <strong>23 DLR (SC) 25, 27 DLR(AD) 65 </strong>and<strong> 29 DLR (SC) 110</strong><em>; </em>that the High Court Division while observing that period of such requisitioned property shall end with the publication of notification in the official gazette under Section 93A (5) (h) of the (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act, 1948 and such requirement was mainly intended to bring to an end to the requisitioned proceedings and has got nothing to do with the mode and manner of determination of the price of acquired land, misinterpreted the relevant provisions of law and came to a decision contrary to the settled principles of law as enunciated by the by this Court reported in<em> <strong>23 DLR(SC) 25 </strong></em>and<strong><em> 29DLR(AD) 110;</em></strong> that the High Court Division failed to appreciate and consider properly that the Joint District Judge and the Arbitrator while assessing compensation of the appellants' 11.5750 acres of bhiti land at TK.5,20,66,954.37 paisa on the basis of materials on record particularly Exhibit 53(Ka) the registered deed dated 10.09.1999 has taken into consideration the proximity in between the average value of the land with similar description and similar advantages in the vicinity during 24 months proceeding the date of Gazette Notification dated 31.08.2000 and the service of notice dated 18.01.1966 under Section 5(la) of the (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act, 1948 at TK.10,50,000.00 per acre which is in conformity with the decision of reported in <strong><em>42 DLR(AD) 100.</em></strong>"<br/><br/>6. Mr. Rafiqul Islam, learned Counsel, appearing for the appellants submitted that the impugned judgment and order dismissing the appellants' appeals and allowing the respondent No.2's Cross-Miscellaneous Appeal with cost and sending the case back on remand for assessment of compensation afresh of the acquired land during twenty four months proceeding the date of service of notice on 30.10.1965 is not legal and the same is against the settled principles of law; that the period of such acquisitioned property shall end with the publication of notification in the official gazette under Section 93A(5)(h) of the Town Improvement Act, 1953 and under Section 5(7) of (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act, 1948 and such requirement was mainly intended to bring an end to the requisitioned proceedings and has got nothing to do with the mode and manner of determination of the price of acquired land, misinterpreted and mis-appreciated the relevant provisions of law and came to a decision contrary to the settled principles of law as enunciated by the highest Court; that the learned Joint District Judge and the Arbitrator while assessing compensation of the appellants' 11.5750 acres of bhiti land at TK.5,20,66,654.37 paisa on the basis of materials on record particularly Exhibit 53(Ka) the registered deed dated 10.09.1999 has taken into consideration the proximity in between the average value of the land with similar description and similar advantages in the vicinity during 24 months preceding the date of gazette notification dated 31.08.2000 and of the service of notice dated 18.01.1966 under Section 5(la) of the (Emergency) Requisition of the Property Act, 1948 at TK.10,50,000.00 per acre; that the appellants received the part amount of compensation money on the basis of rough and ready calculation with objection and in his deposition as P.W.1 categorically stated that he received the amount with objection, the High Court Division is not justified in taking evasive view on that point; that out of total 16.65 acres of appellants' land only 11.5750 acres was acquired in Special L.A. Case No.8 of 1964-65 and the fact was corroborated by evidence both oral documentary; that while deciding to sent the case back on remand to the learned Joint District Judge and the Arbitrator for assessment of compensation afresh as stated earlier the High Court Division failed to consider that the respondent took more than 35 years to complete the process of acquisition in the instant case.  <br/><br/>7. Mr. T.H. Khan, learned Counsel, appearing for the respondents submitted that the determination of compensation price on the date of publication of notice finally acquiring the land in 2000 is against the law; that the Deputy Commissioner correctly determined the price on the average of 24 month's price preceding the date of service of initial notice for acquisition whereas the learned Arbitrator erroneously determined the price prevailing in 2000 when the notification finally acquiring the land was published in the gazette on 31.08.2000; that acquisition and requisition in accordance with law is lawful even if payment of compensation is delayed; that the law requiring the Government to publish a notification in the official gazette that the Government has decided to acquire the requisitioned property and with such publication, the requisitioned property shall vest absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances; that the period of such requisition of such property shall and is the same as provided in Section 93A (5) (h) of the Town Improvement Act, 1953 and Section 5(7) of the (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act, 1948. Such notice was mainly intended to bring an end to the acquisition proceeding and has got nothing to do with the mode and manner of determination of the price of acquired land; that the perfection of requisition and acquisition of properties by the Government is not dependent upon payment of compensation as far as possession thereof is concerned with the publication of the requisition notices in the gazette, the land or properties so requisitioned or acquired become vested in the provincial Government and compensation is paid in terms of the law either at ordering the requisition of properties or thereafter, but the vesting of the properties in the Government is not contingent on payment or non-payment of the compensation. The learned Counsel further submitted that under Section 5(7) of the Act, 1948 the Provincial Government shall publish in the official gazette a notice to the effect that the Provincial Government has decided to acquire the requisitioned property; that determination of the price of the land by the learned Arbitrator was imaginary, baseless and against the law and such assessment could not be sustained in the facts and circumstances of the case; that the Deputy Commissioner determined the price of the land on the average of sales of similar land in the area. After the final award was given, very small amount was due to appellants for which the grievance of the appellants has got no basis. Finally, the learned Counsel submitted that the facts of the cases cited by the appellants are distinguishable and are not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the instant cases and the High Court Division acted lawfully and in accordance with law in dismissing the appeals while allowing the Cross-appeals with cost.<br/>7. It appears from the record that the Deputy Commissioner determined the price of land on the average of sales of similar land in the area from 1963 at TK.1,39,768.12 out of which the appellants already received TK.1,34,177.00. Price of the structures through a joint inventory was determined at TK.38,67,153.07 of which the appellants received TK.8,63,110.78 and price of trees etc was assessed at TK.3,336.42 of which the appellants received TK.2,913.24.After the final award was given, very small amount was due to appellant, for which grievance of the appellants has got no basis. It further appears that the Deputy Commissioner determined the price on the average of 24 months price preceding the date of service of initial notice for acquisition. The Arbitrator determined the price on the average of the same as determined by the Deputy Commissioner and that available in 2000 when the notification finally acquiring the land was published in the gazette. The appellants claim compensation at the rate of price on the date of publication of the notice finally acquiring the land in 2000. Under the <em>pari materia</em> of law for the purpose of acquisition, the price of the acquired land is to be calculated on the basis of the price of similar land an with similar advantage during twenty four months preceding the date of service of initial notice for acquisition.<br/><br/>8. At the present, the Rule is changed for determination of the price on the basis of twelve months average preceding the date of publication of initial notice for acquisition. Under all the provisions, the price of the land is to be determined with reference to the date of service and/or publication of the initial notice for acquisition. By Ordinance XIII of 1963, 'five years' average was substituted to 'twenty-four months'.<br/><br/>9. In the case of <strong><em>Bangladesh-vs-Abdul Khaleque and others, (1977) 29 DLR (SC) 110,</em></strong> the Arbitrator assessed the compensation applying the Rule of two years average available under the Ordinance III of 1965 promulgated on 22.03.1965 but made retrospective with effect from 15.08.1963.<br/>This Division frame the question for consideration as follow;<br/>"What will be the law for the assessment of compensation for lands acquired either under Section 93A of the Town Improvement Act, 1953 or under Section 5 of the (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act, 1948 in view of the amendment of the former Act by Ordinance III of 1965, and the latter by Ordinance, XIII of 1963 and both Ordinances came into operation of 15.08.1963, the former retrospectively and the latter prospectively." <br/>This Court held that<br/>"The sub-section clearly says that the step so taken and notice given is barely a proposal to acquire. Sub-section (6) provides for the decision of the Government to acquire, and sub-section (7) for the publication of the Government's decision, and the vesting of the property in the Government under the Act. Therefore, the property is acquired when the gazette notifications published under Section 5(7) of the Act and the law in force on that day regarding the principles and manner of payment of compensation shall be governing law."<br/><br/>10. From plain reading of Section 5(7) of the Emergency Requisition of Property Act, 1948 compensation is to be assessed when property is to be acquired under Section 5(7) or when the dispute about the compensation is referred to the Arbitrator in the case reported in <strong><em>23 DLR (AD) 25. </em></strong><br/><br/>11. A notice under Section 5(1) is only the first step in the acquisition of a property. The Government may decide not to acquire the property on the report of the authorized officer and accordingly, no right or obligation arises due to issuance of a notice declaring merely the intention of Government to acquire any requisitioned property and accordingly no right or obligation is created by issuance of such notice. Thus, forming definitely the intention of the Government to acquire the property upon issuance of a notice under Section 5(7) published in the official gazette definitely demonstrated that the property stood acquired and vested in the Government only when the question of assessment of compensation for the purpose arises. Thus, compensation should be assessed in accordance with state of law as it prevails when the property thus stands acquired.<br/>11. A requisitioned property before it stands acquired is to pass through various stages as set out in different sub-sections of Section 5 when the gazette notification is published under sub-section (7) of Section 5 of the Act and the law in force on that day is a date regarding the principles and manner of payment of compensation shall be the governing law. It has been held in the case <strong><em>of Bangladesh-vs-Abdul Khaleque and others</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>29 DLR (SC) 110</em></strong> that "We think, that on a true construction of the principal law of Section 7, the governing date will be when the property stands acquired. Section 7 clearly says that on the requisition or acquisition of the property, the compensation in the manner indicated in the section shall be paid." On 15.08.1963 Ordinance XIII of 1963 was promulgated introducing twenty-four months average in place of gazette notification dated 30.03.1914 under Section 5(7) of the Act was published on 09.04.1964 and the Supreme Court held that the value of compensation is to be assessed as the law stand when the property was acquired.<br/><br/>12. In the said decision it was held that "we, therefore, accept the decision of Sharafatullah's case to the extent it says that the compensation should be assessed in accordance with law as it prevails when the property stands acquired, but not the two other suggested dates." The said decision, thus, resolved the controversy as to the date which will govern the assessment of compensation.<br/><br/>13. In the case of <strong><em>Abdul Gafur Khan-vs-Bangladesh and others </em></strong>reported in <strong><em>42 DLR (AD) 99 </em></strong>by this judgment the compensation as awarded by the Arbitrator has challenged the enhancement which was made by the Arbitrator in accordance with law. Although they differ as to which is the appropriate law governing the subject. The fact of the case was an area of 9.09 acres of land including tank was requisitioned under Section 3 of the Emergency Requisition of Property Act and possession was taken on 08.03.1961 for construction WAPDA Colony. Subsequently, the said land was acquired on 1<sup>st</sup> November, 1968. The Deputy Commissioner, Rajshahi, assessed compensation at TK. 41,053.03 paisa, the rate of which comes about TK. 4,500.00 per acre. The land owners did not accept this assessment on the ground that it was very inadequate and brought the matter to the Arbitrator appointed under the Act. Before the Arbitrator, the Government, produced some sale deeds of years 1958-1961 in order to show that the average value similarly situated lands in the neighbourhood was TK.6,000.00 (six thousand) per acre; whereas the land owners produced some sale deeds of the year 1968 showing per acre value of land in the vicinity at TK. 60,000/- (sixty thousand). The Arbitrator did not accept either of the two widely divergent claims and fixed valuation at TK.20,000.00 (twenty thousand) per acre and on that basis made an award for TK. 2,52,361.00. The owners filed an F.M.A.T No. 242 of 1979 and the single judge of the High Court Division by the impugned judgment took the average value of land during the period between year 1961 in which the land was finally requisitioned, and the year 1968 in which the land was finally acquired and on that basis fixed compensation at TK.30,000.00 and on that basis fixed per acre. Accordingly, the learned single judge of the High Court Division raised the assessment from TK. 2,52,361.00 to 3,50,000.00.<br/><br/>14. In the appeal the learned Advocate for the appellant though submitted that the appellant who took leave to appeal was that the period of twenty-four months should precede the date of acquisition i.e. 1<sup>st </sup>November, 1968 but the Appellate Division held that this contention is palpably wrong being contrary to the statutory provision of law. In view of the law the Government in that case contended that the twenty-four months should precede the date of requisition but the land owners' contention was that twenty-four months should precede the date of acquisition. In the instant case though the notice for acquisition under Section 5(a) was served in 1962 the land was actually acquired in 1968 i.e. after the expiry of 6 years when the value of the land increased to a great extent. The Government did not explain why the notice was served in 1962 but acquisition was made in 1968. The said decision proceed to hold that "although there is no particular period within which a requisitioned land is to be acquired for the notice for acquisition has been served, yet when the value of the land was increasing but that of money was decreasing the compensation to be paid now on the valuation of the year, 1962 would cause substantially injury to the land owner. There should be same proximity between the date of notice for acquisition and that actual acquisition. Be that as it may, the point of law now taken during the hearing of the appeal before us was not raised. The learned single judge of the High Court Division missed the appropriate law for latches of the Government; but the valuation at TK.30,000.00 per acre is found to have met the ends of justice, fairness and equity in this case in the circumstances as shown above.<br/><br/>15. In the instant case the Deputy Commissioner determined the price of the land on the average of sale of similar land in the area from 1963 to 1965 at TK.1,39,768.12 for the total land acquired. Following the aforesaid decision particularly the decision in the case of <strong><em>Abdul Gafur Khan-vs-Bangladesh and others</em></strong> in<strong><em> 42 DLR (AD) 99</em></strong> we have noticed the gap between the notices of acquisition in 1963 and the final order of acquisition under Section 5(7) of the Emergency Requisition of Property Act, 2000.<br/><br/>16. Thus, we found that the amount assessed for compensation for the land was at shockingly low price according to the valuation of 2000 when the land stood acquired causing substantial injury to the land owner. The acquisition Authority lost sight of proximity both of the notices and the date of actual acquisition and even the High Court Division missed the appropriate part of laches of the Government in finally publishing the gazette acquiring the land in 2000 and the valuation of land in 1963 being negligible whereas the value of land unbelievably increased in 2000 than when the land in question is stood requisitioned.<br/><br/>17. It appears from the judgment of Arbitrator i.e. joint District Judge, Arbitration Court, Dhaka, fixed the value of the land at TK.78,12,500.00 adding 25% more than the 'chala' land for 'nal' land and arrived at a finding that per acre of 'chala' land at TK. (78,12,500.00+10,500.00) ÷ 2= 39,11,400.00 and accordingly fixed the schedule land of 11.5750 acres of TK.4,52,75,612.50 and together with 15% statutory compensation amounts to TK.67,91,341.87 totalling 5,20,66,954.37 out of which the petitioner has already withdrew TK.1,39,768.92 remaining of TK.5,19,27,185.45.<br/><br/>18. The High Court Division, however, held that the appeal of the appellant was dismissed allowing the cross appeal of the respondent-Government setting aside the impugned order of the Arbitrator and sending back the case on remand for assessment of compensation afresh of the land acquired on the basis of value of similar land and with similar advantage during twenty-four months in the light of its observations within a period of three months from the date of receipt of the copy of the judgment.<br/><br/>19. It appears that the initial notice of acquisition was issued in the case on 30.10.1965 and the Deputy Commissioner determined the price of the value on the average sale during twenty-four months preceding the date of service of notice for acquisition at TK.10,500.00, the total price of the land being at TK.1,39,768.12, out of which the appellant already received TK.1,34,177.00.<br/><br/>20. In the decision reported in <strong><em>42 DLR (AD) 99</em></strong> discussed above though the land was acquired under Section 5(1)(a) in 1963 but finally such acquisition under sub-section 7 of the Section 5 was published by the Government in 1967. <br/><br/>21. In the said cited decision, thus, the acquisition was made in 1963 but the final gazette notification was published in 1967, considering the proximity of the date and for the ends of justice the Court fixed TK.30,000.00 as the proper value for the acquired land. Following the principle decided in the said decision, in the instant case though the land was initially acquired in 1965 but the gazette notification under sub-section (7) of Section 5 was published in 2000 and rise the value and that the depreciation of the money value meanwhile and the deliberate laches of the Government to issue the final order, we are of the view that the valuation at TK. 80,000.00 (eighty thousand) per acre is found to meet the ends of justice, fairness and equity resulting in substantial justice in this case.<br/><br/>22. The amount of compensation regarding the trees, houses and structures taken over earlier were determined during the period of such take over and accordingly, paid and as such, no fresh assessment for the same as to the value of the trees, buildings and the structures at the relevant time do not arise in the fact and circumstances of the case. With this finding and observation we disposed of the appeal and sent the same to the Arbitrator for assessment of compensation in the light of our finding above for the land actually acquired in the case as early as possible. <br/><br/>23. Accordingly, the appeal is disposed of directed the Arbitrator to determine the trial involved in acquisition for assessment of compensation at TK.80,000.00 per acre without any order as to costs.<br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
