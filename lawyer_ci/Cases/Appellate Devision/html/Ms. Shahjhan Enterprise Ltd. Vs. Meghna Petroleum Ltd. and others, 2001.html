The short fact leading to this appeal is that defendant No. 3 Dhaka Nawab Waqf Estate is the owner of the suit land from which estate Nawab Khawja Habibullah Bahadur took lease of the suit property by lease deed dated 1.3.1952 for a period of 25 years and took pos­session of the same. While in possession of the suit property as a lessee under the Waqf Estate Nawab Khawja Habibullah Bahadur inducted defendant No. 1 M/s. James Finlay and Company Limited as a monthly tenant at a rental of Tk. 25/- per month. Defendant No. 1 started business of Petrol Pump and service sta­tion on the land as a Dealer of M/s. Burmah Oil Company and then Standard Vacuum Oil Company Limited. This company was acquired by Bangladesh Government and interest of the company was transferred to Meghna Petroleum Limited who is defendant No. 2 in the suit and M/s James Finlay and Company Limited defendant No. 1 continued dealership of Petroleum Products under defendant No. 2. It is also the case of the plaintiff that 25 years lease of Nawab Khawja Habubullah Bahadur ended on 1.3.1977 whereupon defendant No. 3 Dhaka Nawab Waqf Estate became absolute owner of the suit land and was legally entitled to rent payable by defendant Nos. 1 and 2 which was raised to Tk. 600/- per month in the meantime. It is also the case of the plaintiff that defendant No. 1 M/s. James Finaly and Company Limited did not pay rent to the Waqf Estate and then the Mutwalli of estate Nawab Khawja Abdul Gani asked defendant No. 1 to finalize the matter for fresh Bhara Bangladesh with the Dhaka Nawab Waqf estate but defendant Nos. 1 and 2 took no step in this regard. Thereafter defendant No. 3 Dhaka Nawab Waqf Estate through the Mutwalli Nawab Khawja Abdul Gani took per­mission from the Admisntrator of Waqf to grant long term lease of the suit land and lease out the same to the plaintiff for a period of 45 years and accordingly a deed of lease was registered on 4.3.1982 and by a letter of the same date requested defendant No. 2 Meghna Petroleum Ltd. To deliver vacant possession of the suit land in favour of the plaintiff lessee M/s Shahajahan enterprise Ltd. Who is the appellant before this court. A copy of this letter was also sent to defendant No. 1 M/s James Finlay and Company Limited but these two defendants did not respond to this letter whereupon a notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act was served upon defendant Nos. 1-2 on 10.3.1982 but in spite of that they did not deliv­er possession to the plaintiff. It is also the case of the plaintiff that subsequently these two defendants made payment of 33 months arrear rent at a time to the Waqf Estate. Then again defendant No. 2 made an advertisement in the daily Ittefaq on 30.6.1987 about installation of self servicing machine on the suit land which prompted the appellant to file the aforesaid suit for ejectment and compensation.<br/><br/>3. Before the trial Court defendant Nos. 1 and 2 entered appearance and filed two separate written statements denying the allegations made in the plaint. Case of defendant no. 1 is that they were dealer of defendant No. 2 which was can­celled with effect from 30.6.1987 and defendant No. 2 is now running the filling station in the suit land from 1.7.1987. His further case is that defendant No. 1 took monthly lease of the suit land by lease deed on 1.8.1953 as a dealer of defendant No. 2's predecessor and said lease expired before 1971. Their further case is that defendant No.2's predecessor ESSO Eastern Company took lease of the suit land from its owner and constructed structures thereon and when defendant No. 2 took over the manage­ment of ESSO Eastern Company they contin­ued with the business in the suit land.<br/><br/>4. Case of defendant No. 2 Meghna Petroleum Ltd, is that Standard Vacuum Oil Company Limited carried on business of petro­leum products for a long time and this company was subsequently named as ESSO Standard incorporation and lastly as ESSO Standard Incorporation. This new company took month­ly lease of the suit land from Nawab Begum Ayesha for a period of 10 years commencing from July 1969 with the provision of renewal for another 10 years for the purpose of petrol filling and servicing station thereon. When defendant No. 2 was running this filling station of ESSO Eastern Incorporation Government of Bangladesh acquired the ESSO undertaking with all its moveable and immovable properties and handed over the property to Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation under the provision of Petroleum corporation Ordinance, 1976 under which Meghna Petroleum Ltd. Was set up as an oil company having all the assets and tenancy rights of ESSO company. Thus defendant No.2 Meghna Petroleum Ltd. Became a tenant in the suit premises and they regularly paid rent. When lease of Nawab Ayesha Begum expired defendant No. 2 became a direct tenant under the Waqf Estate who accepted rent from them and by operation of law they became a tenant under defendant No. 3 Dhaka Nawab Waqf Estate. Their further case is that they are not defaulters and they have not received any notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act nor any letter as alleged in the plaint.<br/><br/>5. The learned Subordinate Judge framed 7 issues and then took evidence both oral and documentary in support of the case of the respective parties and thereafter vide judgment dated 12.4.1993 decreed the suit for eviction and compensation.<br/><br/>6. Being aggrieved by this Judgment and decree First Appeal No. 122 of 1993 was taken to the High Court Division. The High Court Division then by judgment dated 2<sup>nd</sup> June 1997 allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit. Thereafter the plaintiff moved this Division and leave was granted on the following terms: - <br/>"Khondaker Mahbubuddin Ahmed learned Counsel for the plaintiff peti­tioners submits that in view of the oral evidence of P.W.2 Nawabjada Khawja Abdul Ghani, Mutwalli of the Dhaka Nawab Waqf Estate at the relevant time supported by documentary evidence Ext. 7 (permission given) by the Waqf Administrator to give long term lease) the High Court Division misconstrued the evidence of P.W 2 and erred in holding that he was not Mutwalli of the Dhaka Nawab Waqf Estate at the relevant time. Secondly he submits that in view of oral and documentary evidence on record which was either misread or misconstrued the High Court Division erred in holding that no relationship of landlord and tenant existed between the plaintiff and defendant Nos. 1 and 2 in respect of the suit land although admit­tedly defendants 1 and 2 were monthly tenants first under the lessee of the Waqf Estate and thereafter under the plaintiff by operation of law and Mutwalli's notice to attornment the plaintiff as being lessee under the Dhaka Nawab Waqf Estate landlord. Thereby, he sub­mits that defendant Nos. 1 and 2 not being lessee under the Dhaka Nawab Waqf Estate and the Estate having not allowed the said defendants to make any construction as landlord, the provi­sion of section 7 (5) of Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act 1949 being not applicable to the case section 9 (1)(b) is not attracted to the ease and as such the High Court Division erred in holding that 6 months notice was necessary to terminate the tenancy. Next he submits that the High Court Division erred both in law and on fact in refusing to decree for compensation for illegal occupation and use of the suit land by defendant No. 1 after lawful determina­tion of monthly tenancy by notice Ext. 3 lastly he submits that the High Court Division wrongly held that the suit for eviction only is not maintainable." <br/><br/>7. From the perusal of the record it appears that this suit was filed by the plaintiff-appellant alleging that the suit land belonged to Dhaka Nawab Waqf Estate and the same was leased out initially to Nawab Khawja Habibullah Bahadur on 1.3.1952 for 25 years. It is also the case of the plaintiff that defendant No. 1 M.s James Finlay and Company Limited took 'Bhara' settlement of the suit plot from Nawab Khawja Habibullah Bahadur at monthly rental of Tk. 75/- who were dealing in petroleum products as a dealer of M/s Standard Vacuum Oil Company Limited in which Nawab Khawja Habibullah Bahadur had a share In the business. It is also the case of the plaintiff that M/s Standard Vacuum Oil Company Ltd. was acquired by the government who established Meghna Petroleum Limited and defendants No. 1 M/s. James finley and Company Limited was dealing with petroleum products supplied by defendant No. 2 Meghna Petroleum Limited. After 25 years of taking lease by Nawab Khawja Habibullah Bahadur on 1.3.1977 defen­dant No. 3 Waqf Estate became entitled to rent of the premises and at that time rent was Tk. 600/- per month. It is also the case of the plaintiff that when defendant Nos. 1-2 failed to pay rent to defendant No. 3 then Nawab Khawja Abdul Gani wrote a letter to defendant No. 2 and asked them to settle the matter with the Waqf Estate. Copy of this letter was also for­warded to defendant No. 1 Further case of the plaintiff is that defendant Nos. 1 and 2 are defaulters and as such they have no right to con­tinue with their possession. During continu­ance of such situation on 4.3.1982 with the per­mission of Administrator of Waqf Motwalli Nawab Khawja Abdul Gani settled the suit land with the plaintiff by a registered lease deed for a period of 45 years from 4.3.1982. There was a stipulation that the lessee would be entitled to evict defendant Nos. 1-2 from the suit property and on the same date defendant No. 3 i.e. Motwalli by a letter sent under registered post requested the defendants to hand over posses­sion to the present plaintiff and on 10.3.1982 on behalf of the plaintiff a notice was issued upon defendant No. 2 by Mr. Feda Kamal, Bar-At-Law asking defendant No. 2 to vacate the suit premises terminating the lease hold right of this defendant and asked them to hand over vacant possession. It is the further case of the plaintiff that since receipt of this notice when defendant Nos. 1-2 refused to vacate the premises the present suit had to be filed. This notice that was issued by the learned Advocate was a notice under section 1-6 of the Transfer of Property Act.<br/><br/>8. It is well settled that when tenancy is to be terminated a notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act must be issued and according to the plaintiff two notices have been issued, one by Motwali and the other by the learned Advocate Feda Kamal. It is the case of the plaintiff that Motwalli on 4.3.1982 informed the main defendants that the suit land has been leased out to the plaintiff and asked them to vacate the premises and also requested them to contact the plaintiff if they intend to take further lease. It is well settled that without issuing notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act no one can be evicted. Now let us see how far the notice issued by Feda Kamal Exhibit 3 can be construed as notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of the Transfer of Property Act. This exhibit 3 is dated 10.3.1982. It was issued to Meghna Petroleum Limited. We have gone through exhibit 3 where it has been stated that the suit property was taken lease by the plaintiff on 4th March 1982 from the Waqf Estate where in defendant No. 1 was doing business on behalf of defendant No.2 Meghna Petroleum Limited and in that notice it has been mentioned that the landlord i.e. Motwalli has already asked the defendants by their letter dated 4.31982 to hand over vacant possession to the plaintiff on the expiry of 31<sup>st </sup>March 1982. In this exhibit 3 there is no men­tion why the plaintiff wanted eviction of the defendants from the suit land. In the notice dated 4.3.1982 by Motwalli it has been men­tioned that the defendants became a trespasser after expiry of their period of lease and they are also defaulter in making payment of rent and here also Motwalli wanted defendants to vacate the suit premises. But admittedly on 4.3.1982 this Motwalli has leased out the suit premises to the plaintiff and consequently he divested him­self of any right over the suit property and in such circumstances this notice issued by Motwalli cannot be construed as a notice under Section 106 of the transfer of Property Act. This may at best be construed as a notice of attornment and a notice informing the defendants that from 4.3.1982 the plaintiff became a lessee of the suit property. The contents of this exhibit 2 indicate that this cannot be a notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act and in the notice exhibit 3 nothings has been men­tioned whey new lessee wanted the premises to be vacated by the contesting defendants.<br/><br/>9. Mr. Khanadker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant submits that this notice is a notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act where in there cannot be any ground for eviction of the contesting defendants. One peculiar aspect of the matter may be noted here that notice exhibit 2 issued by Motwalli cannot be constructed a notice of attornment not a notice under section 106 of the Transfer of property Act as the same was addressed to M/s. Burma Eastern Limited which is or was not a lessee under the Waqf Estate. The lease of the case property was taken by M/s. James Finlay and Company Limited from Nawab Khawja Habibullah Bahadur. As Burma Eastern Limited is not concerned with the lease this notice dated 4.3.1982 cannot be construed a notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. As regards notice dated 10<sup>th</sup> March 1982 Khankder Mahbubuddin Ahmed submits that this is a notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act issued to Meghna Petroleum Limited with a copy to M/s James Finlay and Company PLC. But in this notice there is no ground why the eviction is required. In this notice it has been mentioned in Paragraph 2 that the landlord has already issued notice dated 4.3.1982 asking defendant No.2 to hand over vacant possession to the plaintiff on the expiry of the month of March 1982 but from exhibit-2 it appears that no notice was issued to defendant No.2 Meghna Petroleum Limited. From paragraph 2 of exhibit 2 it appears that the Motwalli has not issued the notice upon defen­dant No.2 informing them that the suit land has been leased out to the plaintiff by the Waqf Estate who requested defendant No.2 to vacate the premises. The submissions made by Mr. Khandker that the Motwalli has issued a notice upon defendant No.2 has therefore no leg to stand upon.<br/><br/>10. Admittedly the suit property was leased out to defendant No. 1 M/s. James Finlay and Company Limited by Motwill Nawab Khawja Habibullah Bahadur for a period of 5 years on 1.3.1952 with a renewal clause. Admittedly the land which was leased out to defendant No. 1 was a vacant non-Agricultural land and the les­see 'defendant No. 1 M/s James Finaly and Company Limited was authorized to construct their own building, filling station, Underground tank etc. the lessor having no right, title or inter­est in those constructions. Defendant No. 1 started a filling station therein for the supply of petroleum products by M/s. Burma Petroleum and thereafter ESSO Inc. took over the business of supply of petroleum product in the filling sta­tion established in the suit premises. This ESSO Inc. was acquired by the Government under ESSO Undertaking Acquisition Act 1975 which is Act No. XVI of 1975 and it came into force on 14th day of March 1975. In section 4 of this Act it has been provided as follows:<br/><strong>Effect of acquisition.-</strong> (1) All deeds, bonds, agreements, power of attorney, grants of legal representation and other instrument of whatever nature in relation to ESSO undertaking subsisting and having effect immedi­ately before the appointed day to which ESSO is a party or which are in favour of ESSO shall be of as full force and effect against or in favour of the Government and may be enforced and acted upon as fully and effectually as if references In such deeds, bonds, con­tracts, agreements, powers, grants and instruments to ESSO were references to the Government:<br/>Provided that in the case of any contract for any service, sale or supply in Bangladesh, the Government may by order in writing terminate the contract or made such alteration or modification of its terms as it may deem fit.<br/>(2).....................................<br/>(3) Where any property is held by ESSO for the purpose of, or in relation to ISSUE undertakings under any lease or under any right to tenancy the Government shall, without prejudice to the provisions of section 3, be deemed to have become, on the appointed day, the lessee or the tenant, as the case may be, in respect of such property as if the lease or tenancy had been granted to the Government and thereupon all rights under such lease or tenancy, including the right of renewal thereof, shall be deemed to have been transferred to, and vested in, the Government:<br/>Provided that after the expiry of the term of any such lease or tenancy, the Government may continue to hold the property for such period as it may con­sider necessary on the same terms and conditions on which it was held immediately before such expiry as if the lease or tenancy had been renewed for such period.<br/>(4)............................. <br/><br/>11. From the perusal of the aforesaid provi­sion it appears that where any property is held by ESSO under any lease or under any right the Government shall without prejudice to the pro­vision of section 3 shall become a lessee or the tenant in respect of such property as if lease or tenancy has been granted to the Government, All rights under such lease or tenancy, including the right of renewal thereof, shall be deemed to have been transferred to, and vested in, the Government. It has been provided that after expiry of term of any lease or tenancy the Government may continue to hold the property for such period as it my consider necessary on the same terms and conditions on which it was held immediately before such expiry as if the leas or tenancy had been renewed for such peri­od. So after coming into force of Act XVI of 1975 the government became a lessee in the suit property and by operation of law renewal of the lease is at the option of the Government. So after coming into force of the law it cannot be said that the lease granted earlier to M/s. James Finlay and Company Limited or to ESSO Inc. expired on 1.3.1977. It further appears from Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation Ordinance 1976 (Ordinance 58 of 1976) that the Government established Petroleum Corporation of Bangladesh and assets of ESSO Eastern Inc. which vested "in the Government stood trans­ferred and vested in the Petroleum Corporation. So what the Government acquired stood transferred to the Petroleum Corporation. All rights, liabilities and obligations have been accepted by the Corporation. This Ordinance came into force on 13th November 1976. So from all these it appears that even before 1.3.1977 the Government became the absolute lessee of the suit land which they transferred initially to Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation who in turn established Meghna Petroleum Limited. All rights that had been with the Government now vested in the Petroleum Corporation and conse­quently to Meghna Petroleum Limited. The alleged notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act was admittedly not issued upon the Government to vacate the premises after 1.3.1977. Notice exhibit 3 is dated 10.3.1982 and by this time the Government acquired a right over the property. Petroleum Corporation also acquired a right over the property on 13rd November 1976 but none of them have been given any notice to vacate the suit premises. Issuance of notice upon the Subsidiary Company can not be construed a notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. So from the perusal of these materials on record we hold that no notice was issued upon the rightful occupant to vacate the premises and on the basis of exhibit-3 the defendants cannot be evicted from the suit property.<br/><br/>12. The High Court Division found that 15 days notice issued to vacate the premises is no notice as M/s. James Finlay and Company Limited was doing business of selling petrole­um products in the case premises which require a notice of six months as the land when taken lease by defendant No. 1 was a vacant non agri­cultural land and in the lease deed of defendant No. 1 the premises was given by the lessor to establish a filling station and when the land was a non-agricultural land the lessee may be evict­ed if the same is used against the purpose for which the lease was taken, It is not the case of the plaintiff that the lessee was using the land in the manner other then the purpose for which the lease was taken. Admittedly the lease was taken for establishing a filling station and actually the filling station was established and so when the land is non-agricultural land the High Court division found that notice of six month is required.<br/><br/>13. It appears that construction of building underground tank, installation of filling machine had the like were undertaken by the lessee by their own money which has been admitted by P.W 2 Nawab Khawja Abdul Gani. It is also an admitted fact the Motwalli of the Waqf Estate never became the owner of the aforesaid structure. The structure belong to defendant No. 1, it appears from the perusal of the materials on record that from 1.8.1953 to 30.6.1987 defendant No. 1 has been in undis­turbed possession of the suit property and car­ried on business with the consent of the land lord and from 1.7.1987 Meghna Petroleum Limited a 100% Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation subsidiary company took over business from defendant No. 1 company on the strength of ESSO Undertaking Acquisition Act, 1975 (Act XVI of 1975) repealing ESSO Undertaking Ordinance, 1975 (Ordinance XIV of 1975). We have already found that the com­pany undertaken is in the suit premises and when notice to them has not been issued and when the Government has opted to renew the lease at their desire a suit as filed cannot be decreed. By operation of law the Government as well as defendant No. 2 became tenant in the suit property and they may continue to remain as such at their option. But they are required to pay rent as fixed. In the notice exhibit-3 it has not been mentioned that as the defendants became defaulters or they were using the land otherwise then for the purpose it was taken they are liable to be evicted. Admittedly no notice was issued under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act to defendant No. 1 and the notice issued upon defendant No. 2 is also incompe­tent and is barred by law as aforesaid and in such a legal situation the plaintiff is not entitled to any decree as prayed for. The High Court Division thoroughly considered the case of the parties and rightly found that it is a non agricul­tural land the notice of eviction must be a notice of six months and not 15 days.<br/><br/>14. Mr. Khandker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant submits that the High Court Division was wrong in holding that when the lease was granted to the plaintiff by Mutwalli Nawab Khawja Abdu Gani he was not the Mutwalli and consequently had no right to grant any lease to the Mutwalli and consequently had no right to grant any lease to the plaintiff. He submits that the oral and documentary evidence clearly supported the plaintiff's contention that Nawab Khawja Abdul Gani was the Mutwalli at the time of granting of lease to the plaintiff. The High Court Division it appears considered the oral and documentary evidence of P.W.2 Nawab Khawja Abdul Gani and came to the finding that on the date of granting of the lease this Nawab Khawja Abdul Gani was not the Mutwalli. From the evidence of P.W.2 it appears that during cross-examination twice he admitted that he was not the Mutwalli. In such a situation the High Court Division has not committed any wrong and illegality in holding that at the time of granting of lease Nawab Khawja Abdul Gani was not a Mutwalli. In view of the oral evidence of P.W.2 we hold that the High Court Division has not committed any wrong and illegality in holding that Nawab Khawja Abdul Gani was not a Mutwalli at the relevant time and when he was not the Mutwalli he can not grant any lease to the plaintiff even though he has the permission from the Waqf Administrator to grant lease. It is submitted that immediately after grant of lease to the plaintiff Nawab Khawja Abdul Gani notified the tenant that lease has been granted to the plaintiff by the Mutwalli but it appears from the perusal of the record, that no such notice was issued to any of the defendants by the Mutwalli. The only docu­ment is Exhibit-2 which is a notice of attornment to Burma Eastern Limited who was not a tenant in the suit land. So it cannot be found that the notice was issued to the defendants by the Mutwalli after giving lease to the plaintiff. Further more it appears from the lease deed of the plaintiff that the defendants granted lease to the plaintiff of the suit land along with standing structures. But admittedly the structure was constructed by M/s. James Finlay and Company Limited defendant No. 1 of their own money who initially took the lease of the land from Nawab Khawja Habibullah Bahadur the lessee of the Waqf Estate. The Waqf Estate or the les­sor had or have no interest or claim over the structure constructed thereon in pursuance to the lease deed to defendant No. 1. In such a sit­uation the Mutwalli cannot lease out the land and structure standing thereon to anybody. So the granting of lease to the plaintiff is also defective on that count as well. Furthermore from the notice Exhibit 3 it appears that the plaintiff demanded the defendants to vacate the premises and in the schedul he also included the building and structure over which his lessor had no right. In such a situation also the suit cannot succeed.<br/><br/>15. Admittedly the suit land was a non-agri­cultural land and it was leased out by the Waqf Estate to Nawab Khawja Habibullh Bahudur who inducted defendant No. 1 as a tenant and as per section 4 of the Non-agricultural Tenancy Act a non-agricultural tenant may hold non-agricultural land for homestead or residential purpose, manufacturing or business purpose or religious or other purpose and here in the pres­ent case from the lease deed of defendant No. 1 it appears that they took lease for starting a petroleum products filling station and they were permitted to construct building and under­ground tank for that purpose. So the purpose of taking lease of non-agricultural land is for busi­ness purpose and defendant No. 1 is using the land in consonance with the provision of sec­tion 4(b) of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act and they have been permitted to erect structure and to install underground tank for selling petroleum products. Sub-Section (5) of Section 7 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act provided that if the landlord has allowed pucca structures to be erected on any non-agricultural land held under a lease in writing for a period specified therein then the tenant holding the non-agricul­tural land shall not be ejected by his landlord from such land except on the ground that he has used such land in a manner which renders it unfit for use for any of the purposes specified in section 4 and section 9 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act provides that such non agricultur­al tenant shall be liable to ejectment on one or more of the grounds mentioned in that section and the landlord is required to issue a notice of six months in writing terminating the tenancy. From Exhibit 'ka' dated 1.8.1953 Nawab Khawja Habibullah Bahadur inducted defen­dant No. 1 as a tenant for a period of 5 years commencing from 1.8.1953 with option of renewal for another 5 years but in spite of this clause defendant No. 1 continued to possess and enjoy the property as a tenant up to 1977 when the same was taken over by ESSO. So tenancy continued forever 12 years and in such a case as per provision of section 8 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy act the defendants are entitled to renewal of the lease for perpetuity. So in view of the aforesaid we hold that initial­ly the suit cannot succeed in view of the non-service of notice upon defendant No. 1 who ini­tially took lease and not also upon the Government who acquired interest of ESSO. It is evident that during continuance of the lease of Nawab Khawja Habibullah Bahadur he made an oral gift to his wife Nawab Begum Ayesha which has not been denied and this Nawab Begum Ayesha leased out the suit property to ESSO and ESSO was taken over by the Government. In such a situation notice ought to have been issued to the Government but instead of doing that notice to vacate was issued upon defendant No. 2 which is a 100% Government owned company. The High Court Division con­sidered every aspect of the matter and correctly found that the plaintiff cannot succeed in the suit without serving legal notice upon the prop­er parties and that too a notice to vacate after expiration of six months. Accordingly the High Court Division found 15 days notice is not legal and proper. The High Court Division found that the evidence of P. W 2 indicate that lease of the plaintiff is prime facie not a legal lease and in such a situation mere a suit for ejectment is not sufficient. The plaintiff in such a case had to establish his title and then pray for other relief.<br/><br/>16. Mr. Khandker Mahbubuddin Ahmed Submits that the High Court Division erred both in law and on fact in refusing to a ward a decree of compensation for illegal occupation and use of the suit land after lawful termination <em>vide</em> exhibit 3 but we have already found that the suit has been rightly dismissed by the High Court Division and when the same has been dis­missed question of giving compensation does not arise.<br/><br/>17. Having given our anxious consideration of the materials on record and considering the decision reported in <strong><em>11 DLR (SC) 401 (A.F.M. Kutubudowala Vs. Hafez Muhammad Sadeq)</em></strong> wherein it has been held that the ejectment suit against a monthly non-agricultural tenant hold­ing land for more than one year but less then 12 years the tenant is entitled to 6 months notice and that section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act must be read as being subject to section 9 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act which gives the same right to a monthly tenant as to other tenants we hold that the High Court Division has not committed any wrong and illegality in allowing the appeal and dismissing the suit.<br/><br/>There is therefore no merit in this appeal and the same is accordingly dismissed with cost.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
