Abdul Matin J. -</strong> These petitions for leave to appeal are directed against the judgment and order dated 24.04.2006 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision Nos. 3427, 3388, 3391 and 3389 of 1997 making the Rule absolute arising out of the judgment and decree dated  27.11.1996 passed by the learned  Subordinate Judge, 2nd Court, Feni allowing the Title Appeal No. 30 of 1992 and reversing the judgment and decree dated 01.03.1992 passed by the learned Upazila Assistant Judge, Dagunbhuiyan in decree­ing the Title Suit No. 59 of 1989.<br/><br/>2. The respondent No.1 as plaintiff insti­tuted Title Suit No. 59 of 1989 praying for specific performance of contract stating, <em>inter alia</em> that the defendant opposite parties proposed to sell the suit land and the petitioner wanted to purchase the same for the price of Tk.10, 000/- for which the plaintiff purchased necessary stamp from the Feni Treasury through a vendor on 12.12.1977. The seller defendants received the consideration money from the plaintiff on 01.10.1978, executed the kabala and delivered possession of the land in favour of the plaintiff on the same day. The defendant No.1 executed the kabala by putting her signature. The two defendants are sisters and the name of defendant No.1 was written under her thumb impression by the husband of defendant No. 2. The document could not be registered on the date of execution as it was a holy day. They gave words that they would effect registration later, but they started delaying the matter and on 01.09.1991 refused to effect the registra­tion. Then he was constrained to filed this suit.<br/><br/>3. The defendants contested the suit by fil­ing a written statement stating that they owned 1854 decimals of land including the suit land out of which they settled 5 acres with Ahmed Ali and others in 1952 A.D. orally and the remaining land was being possessed by the defendant No.1 through Bargadar, they never proposed to sell any land  to  the  plaintiff,  never received any consideration money, never executed any document for the purpose and the husband of defendant No.2 had never written the name of defendant No.1, they never delivered possession of the lands nor did they ask the writer to draw the deed nor asked the witnesses to attest the same, the plaintiff has fraudulently created the document.<br/><br/>4. It was stated that the respondent and other 3 more persons being plaintiffs instituted four Title Suit being No. 26 of 1990, 27 of 1990, 590 of 1989 and 60 of 1989 and all the suits were heard analogously and were decreed. Then four title appeals were preferred being Nos. 23 of 1992, 24 of 1992, 30 of 1992 and 31 of 1992 which were also heard analogously and all the appeals were allowed by the same judg­ment.<br/><br/>5. Both the parties adduced witnesses and exhibited documents to prove their respec­tive cases and upon hearing the parties the learned Assistant Judge was pleased to decree the suit against which the defen­dant preferred Title Appeal No. 31 of 1992 and upon hearing the learned appellate court was pleased to allow the appeal by the judgment  and decree dated 17.11.1997.<br/><br/>6. Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and decree dated 17.11.1997 passed by the then learned Subordinate Judge, 2nd Court, Feni plain­tiff preferred the Civil Revision No. 3388 before  the  High  Court  Division and obtained Rule and the Rule has been num­bered as Civil Revision No. 3427 of 1997.<br/><br/>7. The Civil Revision No. 3427 of 1997 has been heard finally and after hearing the parties the Rule has been made absolute and the judgment and order dated 17.11.1996 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge in Title Appeal Nos. 23, 24, 30 and 31 of 1992 have been set aside and those of the learned Assistant Judge passed in Title Suit Nos. 26 of 1990, 27 of 1990, 59 of 1989 and 60 of 1998 have been restored.<br/>8. As against the judgment and order of the High Court Division the petitioners have filed this petition for leave to appeal.<br/><br/>9. Heard the learned Advocate-on-Record and perused the Petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/><br/>10. It appears that the High Court Division believed the contract and found that the plaintiff was entitled to get the kabala in question and the trial court rightly decreed the suit since the contract has been believed the suit should have been decreed by the appellate court.<br/>We find no merit in these petitions which are accordingly dismissed.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
