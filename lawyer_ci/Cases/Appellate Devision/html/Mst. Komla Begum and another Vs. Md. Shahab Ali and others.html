Abdul Matin J. -</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 09.07.2008 passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No.2258 of 2004 making the Rule absolute in part directing to prepare the record of right of the case property in the name of the original owner and record the names of the writ petitioner respondents as forcible pos­sessors in the remark column.<br/><br/>2. The facts, in short, are that the respon­dent Nos.1-10 as petitioners filed Writ Petition No.2258 of 2004 in the High Court Division contending, <em>inter-alia</em>, that Abdul Malek, the predecessor of the petitioners as the plaintiff instituted Tile Suit No.199 of 1977 in the 1st Court of Munsif, Magura, which was subse­quently transferred to the<em> Munsif</em> Court of Sreepur Upazila and was renumbered as Title Suit No.425 of 1983 against Bangladesh and others. The suit was for declaration of title and confirmation of possession alleging that the land meas­uring 3.31 acres of D.S. <em>Khatian</em> Nos.687, 589, 10003, 678 of <em>mouza</em> Nohata, Police station-Sreepur, District-Jessore originally belonged to Kali Kanta Mukhopadhaya by way of amica­ble partition amongst the co-shares. On his death, the case land devolved upon his only son Girija Kanta Mukhopadhya. Abdul Malek, the pred­ecessor of the petitioners, took oral set­tlement of the said land from Girija Kanta Mukhopadhya in 1345 B.S. and got physical possession thereof Md. Yunus Ali Mollah, the predecessor-in-interest of the respondent Nos.5-9, also claimed title to the suit land on the basis of a settlement from Girija Kanta Mukhopadhaya and Chinta Haran Mukhopdhaya. In such circumstances, Abdul Malek instituted the aforesaid suit.<br/><br/>3. Md. Yunus All, the predecessor of the respondent Nos.5-9 and respondent Nis.10 to 13 contested the suit by filing written statements alleging, <em>inter alia,</em> that the case land originally belonged to Kali Kanta Mukhopadhaya and Chinta Haran Mukhopadhya in equal share. Md. Yunus Ali took settlement of the said land from the son of Kali Kanta Mukhopdhya, namely, Girija Kanta Mukhopadhya and from Chinta Haran Mukhopadhya and also got delivery of possession and had been in possession of the same. The case land was wrongly recorded in the name of the Girija Kanta Mukhopadhya in S.A. Khatian Nos.1699 and 1163. Md. Yunus Ali Molla filed Miscellaneous Case No.1185 of 1969 for correction of record of right and accordingly, got his name corrected and paid rent to the Government. After the death of Yunus Ali, the respondent Nos.5-9 as his heirs and successors have been in possession of the land.<br/><br/>4. The trial court after hearing dismissed the suit. The plaintiff Abdul Malek pre­ferred Title Appeal No.54 of 1984 before the learned District Judge, Magura. The then learned Subordinate Judge, Magura by judgment and decree dated 22.11.1987 allowed the appeal. Against the said judgment and decree of the court of appeal aforesaid Yunus Ali Molla filed Civil Revision No.83 of 1988 (Jessore) renumbered as Civil Revision No.6246 of 1991 (Dhaka). The High Court Division by the judgment and order dated 19.05.1999 made the Rule absolute and set aside the judgment and decree of the court of appeal. Thereafter the predecessor of the petitioners Abdul Malek filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 1096 of 1999 before the Appellate Division which dis­missed the petition on 13.03.2002.<br/><br/>5. During present field survey the case property was recorded in the name of Abdul Malek Molla. Against the said preparation of record, Md. Yunus Ali, the predecessor-in-interest of respon­dent Nos.10-13 filed objection case No.746 which was rejected by order dated 20.04.2003 sustaining the record. Against that order Md. Yunus Ali Molla preferred appeal before the appellate authority being Appeal No.61228 of 2003 and the appeal officer by the impugned decision dated 08.02.2004 allowed the appeal setting aside the record prepared in the name of the peti­tioners.<br/><br/>6. The respondent Nos.5-9 including the present petitioners filed affidavit-in-opposition denying all the allegations made in the petition. Their specific case is that the predecessor of respondents Md. Yunus Ali Molla got the case land by way of settlement in the first part of Bahshak 1351 B.S. from the original owner Girija Kanta Mukhopadhya and Chinta Haran Mukhopadhya. He had been in possession of the land. After his death these respondents as his heirs and successor have been in possession of the same. Their further case is that the pred­ecessor of the petitioner filed a suit for declaration and confirmation of posses­sion in respect of the case land. That suit was dismissed and thereafter on appeal the court of appeal allowed the appeal but the High Court Division in a Civil Revision filed by the predecessor of these respondents reversed the judgment of the court of appeal. Thereafter their petition for leave to appeal before the Appellate Division was also dismissed. The petitioners have no possession in any part of the case land. The survey authority prepared the record in the name of the petitioners against which Yunus Ali Molla preferred appeal before the appeal officer under Rule 31 of the Tenancy Rule, 1955. The appeal officer on the basis of the judgment passed by the civil court directed to prepare the record in the name of the respondents.<br/><br/>7. The High Court Division made the Rule absolute in part and directed to pre­pare the record of the case property in the name of the original owner and the name of the writ petitioner respondents to be recorded as forcible possessor in the remark column of the <em>khatian</em>.<br/><br/>8. Being aggrieved by the judgment and order of the High Court Division the petitioners have filed this petition for leave to appeal.<br/><br/>9. Heard the learned Advocate-on-Record appearing for the petitioners and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/><br/>10. The learned Advocate-on-Record submits that after the order of appeal under Section 31 of the Tenancy Rules 1955, the writ petitioners could file a case under Section 42A of the Rules but before exhausting the process under Section 42A of the Tenancy Rules, the instant writ petition was not maintain­able and as such the impugned decision is illegal.<br/><br/>11. The learned Advocate-on-Record further submits that the High Court Division in its special original jurisdic­tion cannot find out the possession of the parties but herein this case the High Court Division committed an error in finding that the writ petitioners succeed­ed in proving their possession in the case land and directing the authority to prepare the record in the name of the writ petitioner in the column of posses­sion.<br/>The above submissions made on behalf of the petitioners merit consider­ation.<br/>Leave is granted to consider the same upon condo nation of delay.<br/>Security of Tk. 1,000/- is to be deposited within 1 (one) month.<br/>Preparation of the paper book is dis­pensed with as prayed for.<br/>The petitioners are permitted to add additional grounds.<br/>Operation of the judgment and order dated 09.07.2008 passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No.2258 of 2004 be stayed till disposal of the appeal.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
