Ruhul Amin J. -</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 13.12.2005 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.2716 of 2001 making the Rule absolute.<br/><br/>2. The plaintiff instituted Other Class Suit No.6 of 1998 in the Court of Assistant Judge, Muktagacha, Mymensingh for declaration that the deed of sale described in the 2nd schedule of the plaint in respect of the property described in the first schedule of the plaint is forged, void, without con­sideration and not acted upon stating, <em>inter alia,</em> that defendant No. 2 was the owner of the 1st schedule property shortly the suit property by inheritance. He exchanged property with some property of the plain­tiff by a registered deed of exchange dated 22.09.1983. Since then the plaintiff has been in possession of the property. He also got his name mutated and has been paying rent for the property. The defendant No.2 with ill motive to grab the property creat­ed a sale deed dated 13.10.1997 with false personification of the plaintiff. The name of the plaintiff is Md. Abdul Rouf but it was mentioned in the deed as Md. Abdur Rouf. The deed was created in favour of defendant No.1, wife of defendant No. 2. The plaintiff neither sold the property on 30.10.1997 nor did any other date and he not receive any consideration money for the property from defendant No.1 The deed is forged, without consideration, void and not acted upon.<br/><br/>3. The defendant contested the suit by fil­ing a written statement contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the original owner of the proper­ty was the father-in-law of defendant No.1 and father of defendant No. 2. After the death of Abbas Ali Miah the father of the defendant No. 2 there was no guardian of the family and it was difficult for his minor children to look after the properties left by him. During that period some per­sons created some forged deed and grabbed some of the properties left by the father of defendant No.2. The property is a pond beside the homestead of Abbas Ali Miah. The plaintiff created a forged deed of exchange in order to grab the property although he was never in possession there­of. However, there was a local <em>salish</em> over the matter and accordingly the plaintiff executed and registered the sale deed in question in favour of the defendant No. 1.<br/><br/>4. The trial Court on consideration of the materials on record decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiff. On appeal being Title Appeal No. 115 of 2000 the appellate Court allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit. Being aggrieved, the plaintiffs moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained Rule which after hearing was made absolute.<br/><br/>5. We have heard Abdul Haque, the learned Advocate appearing with leave of the Court for the petitioner and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/><br/>6. The High Court Division held that the trial Court on consideration of the materi­als on record, examining and comparing the signatures of the plaintiff in the ques­tioned document with his admitted signa­tures came to the findings that the signa­tures appearing in the impugned document are not the signatures of the plaintiff and as such the document is a forged one. The High Court Division further held that the judgment of the Court of appeal is based on gross misreading and non-considera­tion of the material evidence on record and also on misconception of law. As a result there has been miscarriage of jus­tice. The High Court Division it further appears took into consideration the evi­dence of P.Ws.1 and 2 who stated that no consideration money for the questioned document was paid to the plaintiff but in the questioned document Exhibit 1 it was stated  that consideration money of Tk. 15,000/- was paid to the plaintiff. The High Court Division further noticed that defendant did not produce the identifier of the executant of the deed in question to prove the genuineness of the deed. The High Court Division accordingly held that the document in question is a forged one and it was created by the defendant by false personification.<br/><br/>7. In the above facts and circumstances of the case and in view of the discussion made above, we are of the view that the High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials or record arrived at a correct decision. There is no cogent rea­son to interfere with the same.<br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
