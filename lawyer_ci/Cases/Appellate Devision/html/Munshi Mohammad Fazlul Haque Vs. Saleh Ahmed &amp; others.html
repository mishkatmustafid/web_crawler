M. Ruhul Amin J. - </strong>Delay of 151 days is condoned.<br/>This petition for leave to appeal directed against the judgment and order dated 15.03.2005 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 3768 of 1995 making the rule absolute.<br/><br/>2. Short facts are that the present respondent as pre-emptor filed Miscellaneous Case No. 87 of 1988 under section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act in the Court of Assistant Judge, Lakshmipur for pre-emption of the case land transferred by a kabala deed dated 02.07.1988 in favour of the pre-emptee No. 1 who is a stranger purchaser and the pre-emptor is a co-sharer by inheritance and the case is within time.<br/><br/>3. The pre-emptee contested by filing written objection denying the material allegations made in the miscellaneous application and further contended that the pre-emptee is a co-sharer by purchase in the case holding.<br/><br/>4. The trial court allowed the pre-emption case. On appeal in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 24 of 1994 the appellate court allowed the appeal and reversed the judgment of the trial court. Being aggrieved, the pre-emptor moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained the Rule, which after hearing made the Rule absolute.<br/><br/>5.  We have heard Mr. Saleemullah, the learned Advocate for the petitioner and Mr. Nurul Islam Bhuiyan, the learned Advocate-on-Record for the respondent and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/><br/>6. It is not disputed that the pre-emptor is co-sharer by inheritance and the pre-emption case is within time and the pre-emptee is co-sharer by purchase.<br/><br/>7. The High Court Division accordingly held that the co-sharer by inheritance (pre-emptor) would exclude co-sharer by purchase (pre-emptee). The High Court Division further held that the appellate court on misappreciation of the fact and law allowed the appeal.<br/><br/>8. Since the pre-emptor is a co-sharer by inheritance and the pre-emption case is within time, and the pre-emptee is a co-sharer by purchase we are of the view that the High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials on record made the Rule absolute. There is no cogent reason to interfere with the same.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the leave petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
