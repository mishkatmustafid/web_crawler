The facts, in short, are that the petition­er as plaintiff instituted a suit being Title Suit No. 10 of 1998 in the Court of the learned Joint District Judge, 1st Court, Faridpur for a decree of partition in respect of .07 ½ acres of land with a tin shed house and 1/11 share of tin shed house, 29 Bandh and 35 Bandh each and also in respect of 4(four) annas share of a 1200 square feet building pressing into service basic contentions that Dr. Md. Yasin having being owner of 8(eight) annas share in Plot No.982 transferred the same in favour of Shamsuddin Mollah by a deed of conveyance dated 07.06.1962. Shamsuddin Molla, thereafter transferred the said land in favour of Delwara Khatoon by sale deed dated 07.06.1966. Plaintiff is daughter of Delwara Khatoon. Plaintiff is unmarried. Delwara Khatoon orally gifted .330 acres of land and tin shed house on 23.03.1972 to plaintiff. Plaintiff accepted gift and had been inducted into possession on gifted land. Delwara Khatoon being owner of rest .1367 acres of land and two houses breathed her last leaving behind 4(four) sons and 3(three) daughters including plaintiff. Plaintiff got .134 acres of land. Plaintiff and her elder brother jointly built a building wherein plaintiff spent Tk.55, 000.00 and plaintiff accordingly, got 4(four) annas share of building. Defendant No.3 gifted his .248 acres of land in favour of plaintiff by a registered deed of gift dated 26.11.1990 and placed plaintiff in possession of gifted land. Defendant No.1 died intestate leaving behind defendant No.7 as his wife, brothers and sisters. Plaintiff inherited .0022 acres of property from her deceased broth­er by way of inheritance. Plaintiff in the above way got .07 ½ acres of land and pucca and semi pucca structures by way of inheritance and gift and has been possess­ing the same. Plaintiff offered a request to defendants to effect partition but defen­dant having refused to bring about parti­tion on 01.02.1998; plaintiff had been con­strained to file the suit in the Court of learned Assistant Judge, Faridpur.<br/><br/>3. Defendant No.7 put up resistance to the claim of plaintiff on filing a written state­ment denying all material allegations made in plaint. Contentions advanced in written statement were that the suit as framed was not maintainable. Defendant No.1 got .308 acres of land by way of inheritance from his mother Delwara Khatoon and constructed a pucca building with his own money. Defendant No.1 gift­ed his share and building to his wife. Defendant No.7 by registered deed of gift dated 22.02.1998 and inducted wife defendant No.7 in possession of gifted land and the building standing thereon. Plaintiff got no right, title, interest and possession on the gifted land and the building which had been gifted to her by her husband, defendant No.1. Plaintiff is not at all entitled to the share of land and portion of building as claimed by her in the suit and no decree of partition can be awarded to plaintiff.<br/><br/>4. Plaintiff and defendant No.7 led evi­dences, both oral and documentary, in support of their respective claims. Four (4) witnesses were examined in proof of the case set forth by plaintiff and two (2) wit­nesses stood on witness box to lend assur­ance to the case tabled by defendant No.7.<br/><br/>5. Learned Joint District Judge as trial Judge took up issue Nos.1 and 3 together and decided those issues in favour of plaintiff. Learned trial Judge then took up issue Nos.4 and 5 together. In deciding those two issues learned trial Judge took into account pleadings of parties, evidence, both oral and documentary. Learned trial Judge considered two rent  receipts, Exhibits-2 and 2(ka) in respect of payment of rents and came to hold that plaintiff in respect of 462 shahasrangsha land paid rent on 14.12.1994 and 22.04.1997 and plaintiff thus paid rents in respect of her 462 shahasrangsha land. I Learned trial Judge also considered deed of gift dated 23.12.1990, Exhibits-3/1 and rendered decision that examination of deed of gift transpired that plaintiff from his brother Md. Shafiqul Hoque got 308 shasrangsha land by way of gift and in the event of any gift of 330 shahasrangsha land by mother of plaintiff during her life; time in favour of plaintiff, his brother could not have transferred 308 shahasrangsha land by way of deed of gift dated 23.12.1990 in favour of plaintiff. Learned trial Judge thereafter held that on catechism of papers of mutation, record of right, plan prepared by Pourashava and copy of petition to Pourashava demonstrated that each son as heir got 308 shahasrangsha land and each daughter got 154 shahasrangsha land. Learned trial Judge, thereafter, positively recorded decision that by rent receipts and deed of gift filed by plaintiff it had been proved that mother of plaintiff during her life time did not make any gift to plaintiff and plaintiff also did not get any property from her mother by way on any gift. Learned trial Judge thus came to hold that plaintiff failed to prove any written document evidencing that defendant No. 1 during course of construction of house received Tk. 55,000/- (Taka fifty five thousand) from plaintiff and as because defendant No. 1 constructed building on his 308 shahasrangsha land and plaintiff failed to pro­duce any paper in support of payment of money. Plaintiff is not entitled to get any share on the building constructed by defendant No.1. Learned trial Judge, thereafter, held that plaintiff got 154 shahasrangsha land from her mother by way of inheritance and got 308 shahasrangsha land from his brother Shafiqul Haque by way of deed of gift and in all plaintiff got 462 shahasrangsha land plaintiff got title and possession thereon and plaintiff got the right to have her share to that extent only. Learned trial Judge lastly held that defendant No.1 got 308 shahasrangsha land by way of gift from her husband and she got right, title and possession on that land and building standing thereon.<br/><br/>6. The learned trial Judge granted prelimi­nary decree in respect of 462 shahasrang­sha of land in favour of plaintiff by judg­ment and decree dated 16.09.2003.<br/><br/>7. Having felt aggrieved the plaintiff as appellant filed an Appeal being Title Appeal No. 106 of 2003 before the Court of learned District Judge, Faridpur. Learned Additional District Judge, Faridpur heard the appeal and allowed the same in part. Learned Appellate Judge modified judgment and decree recorded by learned trial Judge in the terms that plaintiff is entitled to a decree in prelimi­nary form in .134 acres of land by way of inheritance and .248 acres of land by way of gift vide the deed of gift dated 26.11.1990 by her brother co-sharer and in total .382 acres of land and 111 share in three houses of tin sheds as specified in schedule 'Ka'.<br/><br/>8. Being aggrieved by the judgment of this Court the petitioner has filed this petition for review.<br/><br/>9. Heard Mr. A. K. Badrul Huq, the learned Counsel appearing for the peti­tioner and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/><br/>10. It appears that this Court while dis­missing the leave petition found that the High Court Division rightly calculated the share of the parties and correctly held that the plaintiff is entitled to the extent of 732 ajutangsha and the share of the defendant No.7 is 268 ajutangsha. These are all ques­tions of facts finally decided by the High Court Division which call for no interfer­ence by the Court.<br/>We find no substance in this review petition which is accordingly dismissed.<br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
