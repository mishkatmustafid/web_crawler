Pursuant to this case Bangladesh Bank asked the petitioner to showcause why his money changer licence should not be cancelled and also suspended the said licence pending enquiry by two orders of the same date.   <br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> Being aggrieved thereby the petitioner preferred Writ Petition No.1776 of 1998 before a Writ Bench of the High Court Division which, by its judgment and order dated 12 July 1999, discharged the Rule Nisi issued thereon. <br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> The petitioner now seeks leave to appeal before us. <br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> It has been argued that the criminal case started against the petitioner and others has been pending for long and the petitioner is suffering huge financial loss on account of rent for the premises, salary of staff, etc. on account of the order of suspension. Furthermore, he argues that Bangladesh Bank, the principal, had no right to suspend the licence of its agent lawfully appointed. <br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> We find no substance in the submissions. The principal has always a right to take action against his agent for misdemeanour, especially when it is of criminal nature.  <br/> <br/>The petition is dismissed.  <br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></span></div></div></div>
