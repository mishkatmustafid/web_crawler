The facts, in short, are that Md. Yusuf, predecessor of the plaintiff-respondents, instituted Title Suit No. 69 of 1996 in the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, 3rd Court, Dhaka for declaration of title, recovery of khas posse­ssion and demarcation of the suit property stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that one Tusi Bewa along with other persons were owners of 1320 ajutangsha of property and that on the basis of amicable settlement amongst the CS tenants Tusi Bewa got 200 ajutangsha i.e. the suit property, and that she died leaving behind two daughters namely, Samiran Bibi and Akubi Bibi and that Samiran Bibi died leaving behind one son named Abdul Hamid and four daughters namely, Buri Bibi, Marium Bibi, Isami Bibi and Jaynab Bibi and that then Buri Bibi died leaving behind her husband, one daughter named Sahara Bibi, one brother and three sisters as legal heirs and that another daughter of Tusi namely, Akubi Bibi, died leaving behind one son Nuruddin Mia and one daughter Ozan <em>alias</em> Ozufa Bibi as her legal successors and that aforesaid Nuruddin Mia died leaving behind his sister. It was further stated that Ozan Bibi gifted her property to her daughter Mustari Bibi under a heba-bil-ewaj and Mustari Bibi in her turn sold out the property to Must. Shahani Bibi, the mother of the plaintiff-respondents under a registered deed of sale and that Abdul Hamid transferred his property to Shahani Bibi under a deed of exchange. It was further stated that Marium Bibi, Isani Bibi and Jaynab Bibi sold out their property to Shahani Bibi and thus Shahani Bibi became owner and possessor of the suit pro­perty and that she died leaving behind the plaintiff and that, all on a sudden, the defen­dants i.e. the petitioners, started construction in the khas land of the Government and also they tried to encroach upon the vacant space of the plaintiff's property and though the attempt failed but the attempt of the defendants to make the construction over the Government land created cloud over the right, title and interest of the plaintiff over the suit property and hence was the suit. It was further stated that during pendency of the suit the defendant-petitioners forcibly occupied the property mentioned in schedule-C of the plaint.<br/><br/>3. The present petitioners contested the suit filing written statement denying material allegation made in the plaint and stated, inter alia, that the suit property is in ejmali posses­sion and that no amicable settlement was held between the parties as alleged in the plaint and that Tusi Bewa did never get 200 decimals as alleged  who  was, in fact, owner of 165 decimals and that she as well as her daughters were never in physical possession of the suit property and that there was no vacant space in the suit land nor the defendants ever tried to dispossess the plaintiffs. It was further averred that the SA plots mentioned in the plaint were recorded in the SA Khatian No. 4093 in the name of Asia Khatun along with other persons and Asia Khatun, adopted daughter of Didu Ostagar, was predecessor-in-interest of the defendant-petitioners and  the  construction taken up by the defendants was legally done within the area of the inherited land from the predecessor of the defendants   and the defendants having title and  possession, municipal holding also stood in their name and the plaintiff's case being false the suit was liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>4. Six witnesses were examined on behalf of the plaintiff-respondents while the defen­dants examined four witnesses and the learned Senior Assistant Judge after hearing the suit decreed the same on 30-1-1997.<br/><br/>5. The defendants preferred Title Appeal No. 41 of 1997 which was heard by the learned Additional District Judge, 10th Court, Dhaka who by the judgment and decree dated 25-9-2000 dismissed the appeal thereby affirmed the judgment and decree of the trial Court.<br/><br/>6. The defendant-petitioners being aggrie­ved moved the High Court Division under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure in Civil Revision No. 908 of 2001 and a Single Bench of the High Court Division by the judgment and order dated 6-3-2005 discharged the Rule.<br/><br/>7. Hence is this petition.<br/><br/>8. Mr. AJ Mohammad Ali, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the defendant-petitioners, submits, <em>inter alia</em>, that the High Court Division committed error of law failing to consider that the predecessor of the defendant-petitioners filed Partition Suit No. 3 of 1953 before the 2nd Court of the Munsif against the predecessor of the plaintiff-respon­dents for the same property and the suit was decreed and more so, the said judgment was affirmed in Title Appeal No.96 of 1953 and that the defendant-petitioners enjoyed posse­ssion of the suit property according to the judgment and decree of the said partition suit and so the allegation in the present suit in respect of the dispossession of the respondents is not true and hence the Rule ought not to have been discharged.<br/><br/>9. He further  submits that the High Court Division failed to consider that SA Plot No. 1712 divided into 2(two) plots: one is 7/1, the other is 7/2 possessed by the plaintiff-respondents and SA Plot No. 7612 <em>prima facie</em> shows that it contained 200 ajutangsha of land but the  plaintiff-respondents claimed  the entire 200 ajutangsha land and that the High Court Division did not consider materials on record including the documents filed before the High Court Division and thus committed error of law.<br/><br/>10. We have considered the submissions.<br/><br/>11. It appears that the High Court Division after considering the materials on record observed:<br/>"An Advocate-Commissioner was appointed to ascertain the land of Plot No.7612. The learned Advocate-Commi­ssioner after holding physical measure­ment of the suit land stated in his report that 'C’ Schedule land is the part of Plot No.7612. The learned Advocate-Commi­ssioner also stated that 72 ajutangsha land out of 200 ajutangsha land of Plot No. 7612 are in possession of the defendants where they have started construction. All the PWs stated that the plaintiffs were in possession of entire land of Plot No. 7612 i.e. 200 ajutangsha land, and during pendency of the suit the defendants dispossessed them from 72 ajutangsha land and the courts below concurrently found that the plaintiffs were dispossessed by the defendants and the defendants were not in possession of the said 72 ajugantsha land owned by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs mutated their names and paid rents in respect of entire 200 ajutangsha land and the rent receipt also shows that entire 200 ajutangsha land is situated within muni­cipal holding No. 7/2, Samsabad.<br/>The defendants never paid any rents in respect of any portion of the land of Plot No. 7612 and the said Municipal holding No. 7/2, Samsabad opened long before preparation of S.A. record in the name of the plaintiffs-predecessor. But in the present case the plaintiffs succeeded in proving that their mother Shahani Bibi acquired 17 ajutangsha land by inheritance from her mother Buri Bibi and she also got 53 ajutangsha by purchase through registered deed dated 18-7-1979 and 30 ajutangsha land through exchange deed from Abdul Hamid and she got 100 ajutangsha land by deed from Mustari Bibi. So, in total she acquired 200 ajutangsha lands which is total claim of the plaintiffs.”<br/><br/>12. The main contention of the petitioners is that the decree of the previous Partition Suit No. 3 of 1953 being not legally considered by the courts below there has been error in the decision. But on our query the learned Counsel failed to substantiate that the moot point raised by him now before us was ever agitated before the trial Court or court of appeal below and even in the pleadings the defendant-petitioners refrained from raising the plea now raised before us.<br/><br/>13. In such view of the matter, the points raised before us not being raised in the courts below, cannot be entertained at this last stage at the end of the day. Moreover, there is no material to substantiate the grievance.<br/>In view of the discussion made above, the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
