Nawab Ali, Advocate-on-Record-For the Petitioners.</em><br/><em>Not represented - the Respondents.</em><br/><br/><strong>Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 285 of 2004.</strong><br/>(From the judgment and order dated 10.1.2004 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 1436 of 2002).<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Judgment</strong></span><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Md. Tafazzul Islam J. -</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order of the High Court Division dated 10.1.2004 passed in Civil Revision No.1436 of 2002 discharging the Rule obtained against the order dated 30.1.2002 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 2nd Court, Noakhali in Miscellaneous Case No. 39 of 2001 restor­ing Miscellaneous Case No. 5 of 1998 (Pre-emption) upon an application filed under Order 9 Rule 9 CPC.<br/><br/>2. Brief facts are that late Munshi Aminullah, the predecessor of the respon­dent Nos. 1-7, filed the above Miscellaneous Case No. 5 of 1998 (Pre-emption) under section 96 of State Acquisition and Tenancy Act 1950 pray­ing for pre-emption of the case land on the averments that he having purchased .19 acres of land became co-sharer by pur­chase; the residence of the preemptees is situated far off from the case land; the pre-emptor is a cultivator having only 10 bighas of land; The Respondent No.8, A co-sharer by purchase, sold .71 acres of land to the pre-emptee petitioners on 12.1.97 and he only on 16.2.1998 came to know about the same and he then on 24.2.98  obtained the certified copy of the kabala dated 12.1.97 and filed the miscel­laneous case on 4.3.1998. The pre-emptee petitioners by filing written objection opposed the above miscellaneous case. The miscellaneous case was then fixed on 2.8.2001 for peremptory hearing and on that date the pre-emptor respondent prayed for adjournment but the learned Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge) rejecting the said prayer directed the parties to get ready for hearing and then the above case was taken up for hear­ing and the learned Advocate of the pre-emptor-respondent having not been found on call, the learned Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge) dismissed the Miscellaneous Case No.05 of 1998 for default. Then on 23.8.2001 the pre-emptor filed Miscellaneous Case No. 39 of 2001 praying for restoration of the above Miscellaneous Case No.05 of 1998 and the learned Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge) after hearing and on exam­ining witnesses by judgment and order dated 30.1.2001 upon setting a side the order dated 2.8.2001 restored the above Miscellaneous Case No. 05 of 1998 to its original file and number. The pre-emptee petitioners then moved the High Court Division and obtained Rule and the High Court Division, after hearing, discharged the Rule.<br/><br/>3. The learned Advocate-on-Record for the pre-emptee petitioners submitted that the High Court Division was wrong in dis­charging the Rule without considering that State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 provides its own procedure in respect of appeal and revision independent of the provisions laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure  and the impugned dated 30.1.2002, in terms of the provision of section 96(13) of the said Act 1950 being an appellable order, the proceeding under Order 9 Rule CPC is not at all maintain­able and the High Court Division erred in law in observing that order 9 Rule 9 CPC is applicable in such proceeding.<br/><br/>4.  As it appears the High Court Division discharged the Rule holding that in the case of <strong><em>Kazi Mohammad Joyan Ali and another vs. Raja Pramanik and ors. </em></strong>report­ed in<strong><em> 53 C.W.N. (I DLR 61), Kafiluddin Chowdhury vs. Dr. Abdus Sattar, 20 DLR 1220, A. Jafar Vs. A. Hamid, 29 DLR 306 </em></strong>and<strong><em> Belayet Hossain and another vs. Md. Abu Taher and others, 32 DLR (AD) 231,</em></strong> against <em>exparte</em> order allowing miscella­neous case for pre-emption, applications under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC were filed and those being rejected appeals were filed on the grounds that applications under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC could be filed against exparte order allowing pre-emption and that it is only against order of refusal to restore the exparte order on appeal was maintainable under Order 43 rule 1(d) CPC and in those cases the Court took the view that the proceeding under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC was available against exparte order allowing pre-emption. The High Court Division, relying on the above decisions, held that in the instant case Order 9 Rule 9 CPC is available to the pre-emptor to set aside the order for dismissal for default and section 96(13) would not be a bar in such proceeding.<br/><br/>5. We are of the view that the High Court Division on proper consideration of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision. The learned counsel could not point at any illegality or infirmity in the decision of the High Court Division so as to call for any interference.<br/><br/>The petition is dismissed. <br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
