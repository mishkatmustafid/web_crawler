The company is aresident company, and as per section 2 (55) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1984any income earned by it is accumulated to its total income for computation oftax as per section 176 of the said Ordinance. The respondent company earnedsubstantial income from abroad which has been remitted to the country throughofficial channel, namely the financial institutions. The respondent companybeing well aware of the S.R.O. No. 216 of 2004 presumed that it is entitled toget the benefit of the said SRO as certain portion of its income accrued fromoutside Bangladesh by way of foreign currency. Accordingly the respondentsthrough its attorney requested the Board of Revenue (NBR) to clarify theexemption in respect of the respondents for the purpose of filing income taxreturn in accordance with law. The petitioners vide memo dated 31.12.2007, asevident in Annexure B, informed the respondent company that the income earned bythe company outside Bangladesh will be exempted for the purpose of computingincome tax for the respective income tax year. After getting the aforesaidmemorandum issued by the National Board of Revenue, the ultimate authority forthe purpose income tax assessment and determination, the respondent companysubmitted annual return as per section 82BB (self Assessment) of the Income taxOrdinance, 1984. </p><p style="text-align:justify">      Subsequently, the petitionersissued memo dated 5.6.2008 by which the petitioners cancelled the earlierexemption allowed to the respondents. Thereafter, by the memo impugned in thewrit petition the petitioners issued notice under section 173 of the Income TaxOrdinance, 1984 for correction of the order of assessment for the assessmentyear in question and ultimately issued demand notice as evident in Annexure-Gseries. </p><p style="text-align:justify">      Against the said demand noticethe respondents filed Writ Petition No. 5327 of 2008 before the High CourtDivision and obtained Rule. </p><p style="text-align:justify">Upon hearing, by the impugned judgement andorder dated 21.01.2010 the High Court Division made the Rule absolute.  </p><p style="text-align:justify">Beingaggrieved by the judgement and order of the High Court Division the NationalBoard of Revenue and others as petitioners have filed the instant civilpetition for leave to appeal. </p><p style="text-align:justify">      Mr. Mahbubey Alam, learnedAttorney General appearing on behalf of the petitioners submitted that theexemption in S.R.O. No. 216 dated 13.07.2004, applies to a ""e¡N¢lL''(citizen).  The word ‘person’ beingabsent in the S.R.O., the letter dated 31.12.2007 issued by the RevenueDepartment was mistaken in treating a company as ""e¡N¢lL'' forgranting tax exemption.  The petitionershave all power under section 173 of the Income Tax Ordinance to correct theaforesaid error and thus the subsequent order passed on 05.6.2008 cancellingthe earlier order dated 31.12.2007 is permissible under section 173 of theIncome tax Ordinance. Hence, the High Court Division committed an error inholding that there is no scope to correct the error.  The learned Attorney General furthersubmitted that the word ""e¡N¢lL'' (citizen) as mentioned in S.R.O.No. 216 dated 13.07.2004 does not include any juristic person namely thecompany and the Revenue Department erroneously included the company, i.e. thejuristic person as ""e¡N¢lL'' and that has been rightly corrected subsequentlyand there cannot be any right accrued to the assessee company due to theaforesaid erroneous interpretation of the provision of S.R.O. No. 216 dated13.07.2004, so far it relates to ""e¡N¢lL'' and the High CourtDivision has failed to take into consideration the said facts.</p><p style="text-align:justify">No one hasappeared for the respondents.</p><p style="text-align:justify">We haveconsidered the submissions of the learned Attorney General appearing for thepetitioners, perused the impugned judgement and order of the High CourtDivision and other connected papers on record.  </p><p style="text-align:justify">In view ofthe submissions made by the learned Attorney General for the petitioners, we findmerit in the civil petition for leave to appeal. </p><p style="text-align:justify">Accordingly,leave is granted. </p><p style="text-align:justify">      Preparation of paper book, asprayed for, is dispensed with. </p><p style="text-align:justify">      The order of stay grantedearlier by this Division shall continue till disposal of the appeal.</p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span> </div></div>
