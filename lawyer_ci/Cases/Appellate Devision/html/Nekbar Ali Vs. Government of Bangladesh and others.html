Zahangir, Advocate-on-Record-For the Petitioner.</em><br/><em>Zainul Abedin, Advocate-on-Record-For the Respondent.</em><br/><br/><strong>Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 693 of 2006.</strong><br/>(From the judgment and order dated the 19th April, 2006 passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 6298 of 2003)<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Judgment</strong></span><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mohammad Fazlul Karim J</strong>. - The Writ-Petitioner, Nekbar Ali, seeks Leave to Appeal against the judgment and order dated 19.04.2006 passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 6298 of 2003 discharging the Rule.<br/><br/>2. The case of the petitioner, in short, is that Mouzas namely Mohiran, Bagherpara and Payekpara originally belonged to Dorajhat Union Parished and Mouzas namely Mirpur, Talbaria and Dohakula belonged to Dohakula Union Parishad under Police Station- Bagharapara, District- Jessore; that the respondent No.1 vide notification being No. S.R.O. 214-Ain/2002 dated 3rd August, 2002 declared some portion of said mouzas as urban area and thereafter vide official Gazette dated 27.10.2007 included those are in Bangarapara Pourashava with effect from 30.10.2002; that those six mouzas are within Dorajhat Union Parishad and Dohakula Union Parishad. The aforesaid 2 union parishad are in existence for last hundred years and the inhabitable of those villages continued as voters of Union Parishads as a political unit. By the impugned order only a part of six villages have been included in the Pourashava leaving and keeping the remaining area as rural. Thus, the impugned order is dis­criminatory and it has affected the politi­cal unit and systems of the people of the left out area in respect of exercising their rights as voters of Pourashava; that the ter­ritorial and geographical location of those six villages of Dorajhat and Dohakula Union Parishad stand on the same footing and continued as a same political unit but by the impugned order a discrimination has been made and thus the impugned order is liable to be declared to have been made without any lawful authority and is of no legal effect; that the impugned noti­fication was issued with a malafide inten­tion illegally keeping some areas of those villages as rural. The inhabitants of the left out area repeatedly demanding for inclu­sion of those areas into the Pourashava and in the meantime the respondent No.3 has issued a notice for delimitation of the remaining area of those mouzas; that dur­ing the C.S. operation boundary of a mouza has been demarcated considering the various factors and each of the mouzas had been numbered in the jurisdiction list as J.L. number and without the process of State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, there is no provision to divide a mouza and in the instant case the respondents acted ille­gally and without lawful authority in dividing several mouzas without applying the provision of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act and thus the impugned order is liable to be declared to have been done without lawful authority and is of no legal effect.<br/><br/>3. The respondent did not file any affidavit-in-opposition in the aforesaid writ petition.<br/><br/>4. Mahbubey Alam, learned Counsel, appearing for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner having stated the part of his villages have not been included in the Pourashava and the petitioner having been deprived of being an inhabitant of a Pourashava due to exclusion of his area and the decision of the Government being discriminatory, the High Court Division is not correct in holding that there is no infringement of the fundamental right of the petitioner due to the action of respon­dents of the writ petition. The learned Counsel further submitted that the law does not empower the Government to include a portion of a mouza in the Pourashava by excluding other portion of the said mouza, the High Court Division failed to direct the Government as to the excluded portion of the to be included into the Pourashava.<br/><br/>5. It appears from the record that the deter­mination of the boundary of the Municipality or political unit is an admin­istrative act of the writ respondent under Pourashava Ordinance, 1977 and it is obviously a policy matter, as such the writ-petitioner has no <em>locus standi</em> to file the writ petition. In case of <strong><em>Nizamuddin and others Vs. Bangladesh</em></strong>, the Appellate Division held that alteration of boundary of the Municipality is a question of fact which cannot be decided in writ jurisdic­tion. The similar question was decided by the Appellate Division in the case reported <strong><em>5 BLC (AD) 150</em></strong> that the requirement of population is also a question of fact which could not be disturbed by the High Court Division and accordingly discharged the Rules as not maintainable.<br/><br/>6. In view of the above, we find no sub­stance in the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner.<br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
