Facts are that the plaintiff is the nephew, and the principal defendant is the uncle, and the dispute between them centres round the question whether the property in suit was the joint property of Rajani kanta, the father of the plaintiff, and the defendant. Plaintiffs case is that Rajani and Nishi Kanta, the defendant, were two brothers and they were separate in mess and property. The defendant being indigent was allowed by his affluent brother Rajani to live in the house as a licence. Defendant in collusion with the Municipal assessor has created a new holding No. 319 but the entire premises which is holding No. 328 belonged to Rajani, Plaintiff's attempt at the correction of the Municipal papers failed and so he filed the suit.<br/><br/>3. The defence was that the two brothers were joint in mess and property, and they separated only seven or eight years before the institution of the suit, and so the defendant was entitled to half of the  interest in the suit property. The other plaint allegation was denied.<br/><br/>4. The trial Court on consideration of oral and documentary evidence held that the brothers on the death of their father were joint in mess. Their father left property which remained joint, and in that state the brothers carried on business and acquired property. Rajani being the elder brother was the Karta and had the accounts of the business with him. It also found that the plaintiff withheld the account papers from the Court. It therefore held against the plaintiff and dismissed the suit.<br/><br/>5. On appeal, the Court of appeal below found that there was no documentary evidence to prove that the father of Rajani and Nishi left any property, which was possessed by the brothers jointly, nor was there anything to show that Rajani managed the property on behalf of his brother. It then considered the oral and documentary evidence called by the parties and came to a reverse finding to that of the trial Court.<br/><br/>6. On second appeal, the learned Single Judge of the High Court held that the issues were of fact and therefore concluded by the findings of the Court of appeal below. The second appeal and dismissed.<br/><br/>7. So far as the proposition of law goes, it is now well settled, that in a case where the question is between two or more brothers of a Hindu family living jointly having joint property, the initial onus is on the person who alleges jointness to show that there was a joint family and there was a nucleus of the joint family and the property was acquired during that state of jointness, and then the onus shifts on to the other side who asserts the contrary. The proposition gets support from the cases of <strong><em>Joy Kumar Dutta Vs. Sitanaih Dutt 4 DLR 400 and Appalaswami Vs. Surjanarayanmurti 52 CWN 505 (PC)</em></strong><em>.</em><br/><br/>8. It is to be noted that the trial Court found that the two brothers, namely, Rajani Kanta and Nishi Kanta belonged to a joint family, and they were joint in mess and property, and the property though acquired in the name of Rajani in 1924 (1331 BS) was treated as joint property by the two brothers. Trial Court also found that in the ancestral 4.00 annas share of the property purchased from their co‑sharer by Rajani in his name was blended in the Joint family property, and upon that view the trial Court held that the suit property was also the joint property.<br/><br/>9. The Court of appeal below did not property' place the onus of proof on the parties to prove their cases. The Court of appeal below proceeded on the basis that there were two brothers of a Hindu Dayabhaga School, and in the name of Rajani the property was acquired. It was for the other brother Nishi Kanta to show that there was a joint family and there was joint fund, and the property was acquired out of joint fund. Proceeding from that basis the lower Appellate Court found that the defendant failed to prove his case. On this finding the suit was decreed. The learned Judge of the High Court proceeded on the basis that the appeal was concluded by finding of fact, without examining whether there was proper allocation of onus of proof by the Court of appeal below. The Court of appeal below as well as the High Court found that the two brothers Rajani and Nishi separated themselves only 7/8 years before the death of Rajani which was in 1959. They also found that the brothers were in joint family. The Court of appeal below also found that Rajani and Nishi shifted to the present premises in 1924 (1331 BS) It has also been found that both the brothers sold their ancestral property in 1943. We find that both the learned Single Judge as well as the Court of appeal below were in error in placing the onus. The finding of the Court of appeal below was enough to establish a joint Hindu family with joint property, and therefore the initial onus on the defendant was discharged, and so the presumption drawn by the trial Court that the property acquired by Rajani in his name is to be presumed to have been acquired by or for the joint family cannot be said to be erroneous, since the contrary has not been shown by the plaintiff. The onus having shifted on to the plaintiff to show the contrary it is now to be seen whether the plaintiff, who is the son of Rajani, by evidence has proved satisfactorily, that nonetheless the family was joint and the property was acquired ­in the state of jointness, still the property was purchased by Rajani not only by his own name and out of his own fund, but was kept outside the joint property. There is no credible evidence or any finding to this effect, whereas the trial Court on a consideration of evidence held that the presumption has not been dislodged and we do not find any error in the findings of the trial Court. The Court of appeal below as well as learned Judge of the High Court both committed an error in law in allocating the onus of proof in the case.<br/><br/>10. In the result the appeal is allowed and the decision of the High Court and that of the Court of appeal below are set aside and that of the trial Court restored. There will be no order as to costs.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
