The facts of the case, in short, are that the land measuring 30 decimals in the C.S. Plot No. 883 of C.S. Khatian No. 211 under  mouza Jatrabari,  P. S. Demra, Dhaka, belonged to Rambramhan Tior and Ram Doyal Tior in equal share and their names were recorded in C.S. record; That on their death the defendant No.12-14 inherited their properties and proposed to sell 18 decimals out of the land and that the plaintiffs had agreed to purchase the same at highest market price of TK. 4,00,000.00 and that accordingly, the plaintiffs and the defen­dant No. 12-14 entered into an agree­ment for sale on 03.07.1998 on receipt of TK.2,00,000.00 as earnests money and that possession of land was handed over to the plaintiff-petitioners on the same day where the plaintiff-petitioners are living with their families. It was pro­vided in the  said agreement that on receipt  of balance  consideration  the defendant No.12-14 would execute and register the sale deed; that the defendant No. 12-14 received TK. 1,75,000.00 on different dates between 10.12.1991 and 30.12.2003 by signing on the back of the agreement; that on 03.04.2004 the defendant No.12-14 expressed that the value of the land has increased as such if the increased value is not paid they would not execute and register the sale deed; that on 10.06.2004 the plaintiff-petitioners  offered  balance TK.25,000.00 and requested for regis­tration of sale deed but the defendant No. 12-14 refused to receive the same execute the sale deed and hence the suit.<br/><br/>3. The defendant No.12-14 contested he suit by filing written statement admitting the execution of agreement for sale dated 03.07.1988, the price of the land and receipt of the earnest money of TK. 200,000, and handing over of possession and subsequent receipt of TK.1,75,000.00 and further contended that the plaintiff dragged them over long time causing loss to them and the price of land has increased and expressed their readiness to execute sale deed at a higher price; That the defendant No.15 contested the suit stat­ing that the suit land was included in the vested property list. The plaintiff-peti­tioners, thereafter, amended the plaint stating that in the judgment and decree dated 01.01.2005 in Title Appeal No. 449 of 2002 of the Additional District Judge, 6th Court, Dhaka arising out of Title Suit No. 12 of 1998 of the Additional Joint District Judge, Dhaka it be declared that the suit property was not vested property and the defendant No.12-14 have title in the suit land.<br/><br/>4. The plaintiffs examined 3(three) wit­nesses. On the other hand, the defendant examined none and accordingly, the evi­dence was closes and suit was fixed for judgment.<br/><br/>5. Mr. Md. Nawab Ali, learned Advocate-on-Record, appearing for the petitioner submitted that the Additional District Judge committed an error of land in not applying the settled principle of law that none but the contracting par­ties and the Government should be par­ties in the instant suit for specific per­formance of contract; that the Additional District Judge committed an error of law in allowing the civil revi­sion and application of the applicant No.1-11 for addition as defendant in the suit on the ground of avoiding multiplicity of suits or proceedings in the face of his own finding that already there were suits between the applicants and defendants and the applicants lost the suits and appeals arising therefrom and the appli­cants preferred civil revision against the appellate decree and in not considering that the applicants are not entitled in law to agitate the question of title against the defendants at the trial stage of the instant suit. The learned Advocate fur­ther submitted that the rejection of the application of the applicant No.1-11 for addition ad defendants in the suit occa­sioned miscarriage of justice without considering that the fate of the existing parties to the suit in respect of suit prop­erty would be subject to the result of the Civil Revision No.1362 of 2003 and hence the applicants would not be prej­udiced in any manner for not being par­ties in the present suit; that the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division is not proper judg­ment of affirmance inasmuch as the High Court Division has not controvert­ed the judgment of the Court of Appeal and trial court below on consideration of evidence on record. The learned Advocate finally submitted that in a suit for specific performance of contract a third party is not a necessary party whose presence before the Court is not necessary in order to enable the Court effectually and completely to adjudicate upon and settle all the question in the suit and the petitioner is claiming specif­ic performance for 0.18 acres of land whereas the applicants are claiming 22½ acres of land. The petitioners sub­mit that since the petitioners are not claiming any relief against the appli­cants, they have been illegally added as defendants in the suit.<br/><br/>6. It appears from the record that in the instant case though the petitioners have not enclosed the application under Order rule 10(2) of Code of Civil Procedure in course of hearing of the Rule the learned Advocate for the peti­tioners have frankly conceded that the 3rd party applicants are claiming title on the basis of registered deeds from the defendant No.12-14 and that their deeds are prior to the date of execution of plaintiffs; that the applicants' deeds are forged deeds and if they are allowed to implead as defendants in the suit the nature and character of the suit would be converted to one of title. The plaintiffs are claiming a decree for specific per­formance of contract against the defen­dant No.12-14 and the applicants are also claiming title from the said defendants in respect of the self-same land. If the plaintiffs get decree in the suit there would arise various complications and therefore, the High Court Division is of the view that though the applicants are not necessary parties but they are proper parties in the suit whose presence is nec­essary in order to enable the Court effec­tually and completely to adjudicate upon all questions involved in the suit. The Additional District Judge, in the premises, has committed no error of law in allowing the applicants' petition for addition of parties which has no occasioned failure of justice.<br/>In view of the above, we find no substance in the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioners.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed. </div></div></div>
