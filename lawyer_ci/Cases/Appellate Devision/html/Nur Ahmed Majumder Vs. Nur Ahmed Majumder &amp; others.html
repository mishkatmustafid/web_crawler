Afzal J.</strong> - In this appeal by leave Defendant No.1 is the appellant who has since died and been substituted by his heirs. The appeal is from judgment and order dated 4 July, 1985 passed by a Single Judge of the High Court Division (Comilla Bench) in revision refusing to interfere with the judgment and decree of the lower appellate court de­creeing the suit being O.C. Suit No. 6 of 1970 of the Second Court of Munsif, Feni.<br/><br/>2. Plaintiff-respondent brought the aforesaid suit for declaration of title to the suit land alleging that the suit land originally belonged to one Samad Ali who died leaving daughter Jaitun Bibi and son Ganu Miah; Ganu Mian died leaving son Abdur Rashid who died leaving son janu Miah and daughter Amena Khatun. Thus Jaitun Bibi, Janu Miah and Amena Khatun inherited the suit land and they sold the same to the plaintiff and defendant Nos. 2 and 3 by two registered kabalas died 193.63 and 233.63 respectively. Thereafter defendants 2 and 3 sold their interest to the plaintiffs by Kabala dated 11.2.65 and thus the plaintiffs became full owners of the suit property. In the M.R.R. Khatian No. 106 the suit land was recorded wrongly in the names of Raj Mo­han and others who created a fictitious Kabala in fa­vour of defendant No. 1 and against the said wrong khatian Misc. Case No. 247 of 1966-67 was filed before the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Feni who by his order dated 27.5.67 directed the parties to get their right established in civil court Hence the suit.<br/><br/>3. Defendant No.1 contested the suit by filing a written statement. He denied the plaintiffs case and asserted that the suit land originally belonged to one Mahesh Chandra Chakroborty who sold the same to Rani Sundar Saha. Rain Sundar Saha leased out the suit land to Jamiruddin, Golam Nabi and Minnat Ali who in their turn sold the same to Pitamber by kabala dated 26 Chaitra, 1304 B.S. Ext B(1). Pitamber died leaving 3 sons from whom the property de­volved upon Raj Mohan and others by inheritance. They exchanged their lands including the suit land with defendant No. 1 by a deed of exchange dated 22.2,64 (Ext.B) Defendant 1 is in possession of the suit land by virtue of the said exchange and asserted that the M.R.R. Khatian was correctly prepared in the names of his vendors.<br/>4. The suit was dismissed twice- once in the first trial and then again on remand.<br/><br/>The learned Munsif upon a consideration of the evidence (on remand) found that the plaintiffs failed to prove that defendants No. 4 to 6 are the heirs of Samad Ali, that they failed to adduce any material evidence to show that Samad All's tenancy was ever continued, that the plaintiffs created some documents in collusion with defendants 2-6 taking advantage of the entry in the khatian Ext. 3 when Samad Ali had no title and possession, that the Dakhilas Ext. 2(a)-2(c) were not genuine and thus the plaintiffs were not entitled to any relief. The learned Munsif, how­ever, found that Pitamber and after his death his heirs had been possessing the suit land and that there was no reason to disbelieve the defendant's case of ex­change based on documents Accordingly the suit was dismissed.<br/><br/>5. On appeal by the plaintiffs the learned Subor­dinate Judge, Additional Court, Noakhali allowed the appeal and decreed the suit holding that the plaintiffs sufficiently proved their title and possession in the suit land. As regards defendant's case it was found on the basis of Ext.3 and B(1) that Jamiruddin, Golam Nabi and Minnat Ali had taluki right in the suit properly and they sold their taluki interest by kabla Ext. B(1) to Pitambar, that the vendors of defendant No. 1 had accordingly inherited taluki right from Pi­tambar which was acquired by the Government under the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act since 1956 and consequently defendant No. 1 cannot claim rioyti right and Khas Possession in the suit land on the basis of exchange (Ext. B).<br/><br/>6. Defendant No.1 unsuccessfully moved the High Court Division in revision against the appellate judgment and decree and then came to this Division and obtained leave to appeal.<br/><br/>7. Leave was granted to consider two questions: (1) whether the tenancy of Samad Ali continued in the facts and circumstances of the case as found by the Subordinate Judge and (2) Whether the kabala Ext. B (1) has been properly construed by him.<br/><br/>8. Mr.M.H. Khondker, learned counsel for the appellants, argued that there being no evidence as to the existence of Samad Ali's tenancy beyond the lim­ited period as mentioned in the khatian Ext. 3 and the rent receipts Ext. 2 series belatedly produced by the plaintiffs having been found to be spurious by the trial court, the Subordinate Judge acted illegally in holding that in the absence of any evidence to the contrary it is presumed that Samad Ali Was tenant in respect of the suit property and his right continued Mr. Khandker upon placing the recitals of kabala Ext. B(1) submitted that it was abundantly clear that Jamir Ali and others did not only sell taluki interest in the suit land as wrongly held by the learned Sub­ordinate Judge but as a matter of fact they sold their khash right in the property. Mr. Khandker submitted that the learned Judge of the High Court Division also failed to appreciate correctly the documents Ext.<br/><br/>9. Mr. Nurul Hoque, learned Counsel for the plaintiff respondents while supporting the findings made by the learned Subordinate Judge, submitted with force that the plaintiffs having been found to be in possession of the suit land the possessory title of the plaintiffs' vendors in any case was there not­withstanding the entry as to the limited right of te­nancy of Samad Ali in Ext. 3.<br/><br/>10. Khatian (Ext. 3) was prepared in 1893-94 showing Samad Ali as the tenant and it was also re­corded (Dokholi shotto shunno 8 year). The learned Munsif found that the plaintiffs completely failed to adduce any material evidence to show that Samad Ali's tenancy continued. He also noticed that the plaintiff is silent as to landlord of Samad Ali. He observed that it was only after the remand of the suit that the plaintiffs filed some spurious dakhilas Ex. 2(a)-2(c) allegedly granted by Pitamber. Admittedly the M.R.R. Khatian (Ext. c) is in the name of the successors of Pitamber and the learned Munsif found from Ext. D that it was decided by A.S.O. in 1959 that the predecessors of the plaintiffs had no posses­sion in the suit land. Pitamber's heirs paid rent Ext. F to F (a). The learned Munsif noticed that P.W. 1 admitted that he did not ever see Samad Ali, that his evidence as to possession of Samad Ali could not, therefore be relied upon and no other P.Ws. said any­thing as regards possession of the suit land by Sam­ad Ali. Considering all these oral and documentary evidence and circumstances the learned Munsif found that Pitamber and after his death his heirs had been possessing the suit land. The learned Subordinate Judge, it is found, altogether ignored the aforesaid material facts &amp; documents and abruptly held with­out any basis that it is presumed that Samad Ali's tenancy right continued. Similarly his finding as to plaintiffs' possession suffers from non-consideration of aforesaid material documents &amp; the important fact that there is no evidence of possession of the plain­tiffs' predecessors’ right from the beginning of the present century upto 1963 when the plaintiffs alleg­edly purchased. Thus both the findings as to continu­ance of Samad Ali's tenancy and plaintiffs' posses­sion are open to question and cannot be legally sus­tained.<br/><br/>11. As regards the transfer under kabala Ext. B(1), It is found that Golam Nabi &amp; others (vendors) as­serted in the document that they are owners in pos­session of the suit land and the vendees being vested with Taluki right would possess the same by erect­ing building, raising gardens and digging tanks etc. Mr. Khondker submitted that it was not unusual for a rent-receiver to hold land in khash and to transfer such right as to khas. Possession and in the facts and circumstances of the case the learned Munsif rightly held that Pitamber and after him his heirs possessed the suit land. We think, having regard to the recitals in the document and the subsequent facts noticed by the learned Munsif and ignored by the learned Subor­dinate Judge that the court of appeal below wrongly construed Ext. B (1) to the effect that Jamiruddin and others sold their Taluki right to Pitamber and there­fore by exchange with Pitamber’s heirs defendant No.1 could not claim raiyati right and khas posses­sion in the suit land.<br/><br/>12. In course of the hearing it was found that the Subordinate Judge set aside another finding of the Munsif abruptly without adverting to his cogent reasonings which cuts at the root of the plaintiffs' case. Plaintiffs claimed suit land by purchase from Samad All's heirs. A specific issue was taken up in the trial on remand whether defendants 4-6 were the heirs of Samad Ali. The learned Munsif upon a thor­ough discussion of the circumstances and evidence came to the clear finding that the plaintiffs failed to prove that they are the heirs of Samad Ali. The Sub­ordinate Judge without considering them at all just in one sentence found that the plaintiffs have suffi­ciently proved that their vendors are heirs of Samad Ali. Such a finding ought not to have been allowed to stand in revision when the same was raised as the first ground. Unfortunately the learned Judge of the High Court Division also ignored every fact and doc­ument mat were relied upon by the Munsif (as no­ticed above) and merely endorsed the findings made by the Subordinate Judge without any scrutiny. If de­fendants 4-6 were not the heirs of Samad Ali, there was no question of plaintiffs' title in any case.<br/><br/>13. In view of the discussion above it must be said that the lower appellate court and the learned Judge of the High Court Division committed sub­stantial error in holding that tenancy of Samad Ali continued and that under Ext. B (1) the Taluki interest only was transferred to Pitamber and this error has resulted in wrong decision in the case. Furthermore, the important finding of the trial court, which seems to be correct, that defendants 4-6 are not the heirs of Samad Ali has not been properly reversed. Conse­quently, in any view of the matter, the soil could not be decreed.<br/>14. In the result, therefore, the appeal is allowed without any order as to cost. The judgment and de­cree passed by the Subordinate Judge are set aside and those of the Munsif restored.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
