Tafazzul Islam J.</strong> - This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 13.12.2006 of the High Court Division passed in Civil Revision No. 961 of 1998 making absolute the Rule obtained impugning the judgment and decree dated 25.9.1997 of the learned Additional District Judge, Firojpur passed in Title Appeal No.7 of 1995 reversing those of dated 30.1.1995 of the learned Senior Assistant Judge, Bhandaria passed in Title Suit No.12 of 1993 decreeing the suit.<br/><br/>2. Facts, in brief, are that the respondent Nos.1 and 2, as plaintiffs, instituted the above suit for declaration that the order dated 31.12.92 of Additional Divisional Commissioner, Khulna passed in Redemption Appeal No.26 of 1993 allowing redemption of the suit land is illegal and void on the averments that the suit land belonged to defendant No.1 petitioner who transferred the same to the defendant No.5, the respondent No.6 herein, by kabala dated 28.10.1977 and thus being  owner in possession of the suit land the defendant No.5 transferred same to the plaintiff by kabala dated 19.10.87 and also delivered possession of them and thereafter the petitioner created an Ekrarnama showing that the defendant No.5 executed  an agreement on the date of sale to reconvey the said land on receipt of the consideration and on the basis of the same filed  an application before the Revenue Court,  Bhandaria purportedly under section 95 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act and  got an <em>ex parte</em> order of redemption dated  9.10.1991 and then having come to know about the above <em>ex parte</em> order, the plain­tiffs filed an appeal before the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) Firojpur for  setting  aside  the  above  order of redemption and after hearing the parties the Additional  Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) allowed the appeal holding that the alleged Ekraranama was forged and the order of redemption was thus set aside. Then the petitioner filed an appeal before the Additional Divisional Commissioner, Khulna who by order dated 31.12.1992 allowed the appeal and restored the order of redemption.<br/><br/>3. The defendant No. 1/petitioner contest­ed the suit and filed written statement con­tending that he on 28.10.1977 transferred the suit land to defendant No.5 with condition of reconveyance and on same date the defendant No. 5 executed an Ekrarnama in his favour agreeing to recovery the suit land and the basis of said Ekraranama he on, 9.10.1991, got the order of redemption and also got delivery of possession.<br/><br/>4. The learned Senior Assistant Judge, after hearing, decreed the suit holding that the Ekraranama was concocted for the purpose of the suit. On appeal filed by the defendant No.1, the learned Additional District Judge allowed the appeal. As against that the plaintiffs moved the High Court Division and after hearing the High Court Division made the Rule absolute.<br/><br/>5. We have heard the learned Advocate and perused the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/><br/>6. As it appears the High Court Division made the Rule absolute holding that trial Court, having found that the Ekrarnama, Ext-Uma, was unregistered and the same was written by old ink but in some part of the same fresh ink was used for inserting some line and words including the date, held that Ext-Uma was concocted only for the purpose of the suit.<br/><br/>7. The High Court Division also found that the said 'Ekrarnama' appears to have been be written on a stamp paper of 25 paisa and was not registered and the date shown in the back page of the stamp shows that the stamp was bought on 25—77 A.D, corresponding to 8.7.84 B.S. and the English month in the stamp was delib­erately torn and further the signature of Amjad Ali, the defendant No.5 in the deed of sale dated 19.1.1987, exhibit-3, does not tally with that as made in exhibit-Uma  and in exhibit-3 and he signed his name  therein as AvgRv` Avjx nvIjv`vi and moreover defendant No.5, was not examined in  the suit and no explanation was also not furnished for his non-examination and though two witnesses of Ext Uma were examined but their deposition, after about fifteen years of the sale, appears to have been procured and/or obliging and in any view of the matter the said Ekrarnama does not inspire any confidence about its genuineness and so the trial Court was justified in holding the same was created for purpose of the suit and the appellate Court  did not give any consideration as to the genuineness of the said Ekrarnama. The High Court Division further held that the records show that in the redemption case the plaintiffs were never made party and the defendant No.1 after obtaining order of redemption against defendant No. 5 prayed for possession of the suit land from the Revenue Court and on 19.10.1991 notice in this regard was issued and the report of the process server dated 27. 10.1991 shows that he delivered the possession of the land to the defendant No.1 in  presence of witnesses and on 29.10.91 the case was recorded to be disposed of fully  satisfied but the process server or any witness to such delivery of possession was not examined by the defendant No.1 and  no explanation was ever furnished for his failure in proving delivery of possession  and moreover, when the plaintiffs were not parties to the case then how possession could be delivered from them to the defendant No.1 further no issue as to the possession was also raised in the suit and the consistent case of the plaintiffs is that they are in possession of the suit land since their purchase and defendant never got back possession of the same and they were only interested to get rid of the order of redemption and in the circumstances the plaintiffs are not required to ask for the relief of possession and therefore the appellate Court below fell in serious error in holding that the suit without seeking relief for a recovery of possession is not maintainable in law.<br/><br/>8. We are of the view that the High Court Division on proper consideration of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision and there is no illegality or infir­mity in the above decision so as to call for any interference.<br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
