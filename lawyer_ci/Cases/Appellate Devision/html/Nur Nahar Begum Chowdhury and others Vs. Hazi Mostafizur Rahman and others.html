Tafazzul Islam J. -</strong> This appeal, by way of leave, arises out of judgment and decree dated 10.3.1999 passed in Civil Revision No. 3538 of 1993 discharging the Rule affirming the judgment and decree dated 21.11.1993 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Cox's Bazar in Other Class Appeal No. 59 of1987 affirming those dated 3.8.1987 passed in Other Suit No.175 of 1978 by the learned Assistant Judge, Sadar, Cox's Bazar decreeing the suit.<br/><br/>2. The respondents, as plaintiffs, instituted the above suit praying for declaration of title and also recovery of possession of .07 acres of land, being part of land of R.S. Plot No.2543 appertaining to R.S. Khatian No.1109 at Mouza Cox's Bazar as described in the schedule of the plaint, stating inter alia that .14 acres of land of the above R.S. Plot No. 2543 along with other land belonged to Nilamber Chowdhury and he by patta dated 30.3.1936, settled .07 acres of land i.e. the suit land, from the above R. S. Plot No. 2543 along with other land of R.S. Plot Nos. 2537, 2538 and 2541 of the said khatian to Nalini Ranjan Dutta and that aforesaid R.S. plot No. 2543 was wrongly printed twice in the R. S. Map and further R.S. plot No. 2540 was also printed as R.S. plot No. 2543 and that the description as to boundary of the land attached to the schedule of the patta dated 30.4.36 was wrong and that since Nalini Ranjan Dutta was in possession of the suit land the same was recorded in M.R.R. Khatian No. 568 as plot No. 869 and the remaining .07 acres of the said R.S. Plot No. 2543 was recorded in the name of Nur Ali Chowdhury and others; Nalini Ranjan sold out the land of R. S. Plot Nos. 2538,2541 and the suit land to the plaintiff and Nur Ahmed in his turn sold his inter­est to Saleha Begum, wife of the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff mutated his name and the B.S. Khatian was prepared in his name in spite of the objection of the defendant who has no right, title or pos­session, in the suit land, in the month of April 1978 the plaintiff was in Dhaka and taking advantage of his absence the defen­dant forcibly erected structure on the suit land and thereby dispossessed the plaintiff from the suit land. The defendant appel­lant contested the suit and filed written statements denying the material allega­tions and contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the above R.S. Plot No.2543 comprising an area of .14 acres belonged to Nilambar Mahajan who settled .36 acre of land including .14 acres of land of plot No. 2543 to one Mosan Ali by registered patta dated 12.5.1936 and after death of Mosan Ali his heirs sold out their interest in favour of Hossain Ali Medbar, Hakim Ali Chowdhury, Yakub Ali Chowdhury, Noor Ali Chowdhury and Shahar Ali Chowdhury by registered kabala dated 08.10.1937, while the aforesaid Hossain Ali Medbar and others were in possession of the suit land, Hakim Ali Chowdhury and the heirs of Hossain Ali Matbar and Yakub Ali Chowdhury sold out their right, title and interest to the defendant No.1  by kabala dated 19.6.1961 and since then the defendant No. 1  have been in peaceful pos­session of the same and got a plan approved by Cox's Bazar Pourashava for construction, Nalini Ranjan Datta, was granted settlement of all the lands of the R. S. Plot Nos. 24377 25387 2541 measur­ing 0.26 acre of land and 3½ gondas, i.e. .07 acres of land, from the R.S. Plot No. 2540 and from the boundary of the above .07 acre of R. S. plot No. 2543 as given in the said patta it is clear that Nalini Ranjan Dutta took settlement from plot No. 2540 and not from plot No. 2543; Nalini Ranjan Dutta possessed the lands settled by said patta including .07 acre of R. S. plot No. 2540 situated within the boundary given in the patta more than thirty years and he never took settlement of the suit land and never possessed the same and Nilambar Mohajan never granted settlement of the suit land to Nalini Ranjan Dutta and the plaintiff to grab the suit land, has given a totally different boundary in the schedule of the plaint only to show that the suit land relates to the R.S. plot No. 2543 and not to the Khas Plot No. 2540 wrongly printed as plot No.2543 measuring 0.25 acre only. The learned Assistant Judge, Sadar, Cox's Bazar decreed the suit. On appeal the learned Additional District Judge, Cox's Bazar, after hearing, dismissed the appeal. The defendant then filed Civil Revision No. 3538 of 1993 and after hear­ing High Court Division discharged the Rule.<br/><br/>3. Leave was granted to consider as to whether in view of the evidence of the plaintiff, RW.2, that he has got a hotel named "Niribili" and since the hotel compound, hotel courtyard and the bridge con­necting the road as well as the hotel stands on the lands of Plot Nos. 2537, 2538, 2540 and 2541 it is clear that the plaintiff is in possession of the land leased out by Patta dated 30 April 1936 and not on the suit land which is Plot No. 2543 and the High Court Division has failed to consider the same.<br/><br/>4. The learned counsel appearing for the defendant appellant submits that the defendant appellants having made out a clear case in their written statement that they got lease of land of Plot No. 2540 as indicated by the boundary given in the patta dated 30.4.36, there should have been an issue as to identity of the land settled by the Patta dated 30.4.1936 but nei­ther such issue as to identity of the land attracted by the patta dated 30.4.36 was framed nor the plaintiff respondents took any step for local investigation to ascer­tain the identity of suit land and thereby the courts below and the High Court Division erred in law in deciding the title of the plaintiff in Plot No.2543 without at all ascertaining the identity of the land leased out to him by patta dated 30.4.1936 and further the courts below did not con­sider the map, Ext.4, which proves that the lease by patta dated 30.4.1936 was in respect of the land of Plot No.2540 and not 2543 and that P.W.2 in his deposition stated that he has a hotel named "Niribili" and the hotel compound, hotel courtyard, the bridge connecting the road and the hotel stands on the lands of Plot Nos.2537, 2538, 2540 and 2541 which shows that the plaintiff respondent is in possession of the land; leased out by patta dated 30.4.1936 i.e. .07 acres of plot No. 2540 and not the suit land which is Plot No. 2543.<br/><br/>5. The learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff respondent No. 1 on the other hand submits that R.S. Plot No. 2543 appertains to P.S. Khatian No.1109 belonged to Nilambor Mohajan who granted Dar Rayoti settlement of .36 acres land of plot No. 2543 to one Mohasen Ali by a registered patta dated 12.5.1936 and on the death of Mohasen Ali his heirs sold their interested to Hossan Ali Madbar and his brothers by registered deed of sale dated 08.10.1937 and from them the defendant No.1  purchased the land on 19.9.1961 by registered deed of sale and has been in possession since then and that the learned Assistant Judge decreed the suit on the finding that by the patta dated30.4.1936 executed by Nilambor Mahajan only .07 acres of land in R. S. Plot No. 2543 was settled with Nolini Ranjan Dutta on Dar Rayoti and thereafter the Nolini Ranjan Dutta by a registered kabala dated2.5.1969 sold the above property to the plaintiff and the said Nilambor Chowdhury "sold .07 acres of land to one Kali Komer Paul on 3.3.1937 by registered deed as such the total .14 acres of land appertaining to R.S. Plot No. 2543was sold out and Ext. 5 would show that by Mutation Case No.1044/69-70 the name of the plaintiff was recorded in the record of right and the plaintiff paid rent and had remained in possession of the land and Ext. 6 series show that the name of the plaintiff has been recorded in the R. S. khatian and it also appears that R. S. Plot No. 2540 is the khas land of the Government and the High Court Division in consideration of the materials on records rightly did not interfere with the concurrent findings of the courts below which are also based on the evidences and materials on record.<br/><br/>6. As it appears the learned Assistant Judge found that by patta of Nilambar Mahajan dated 30.4.1936 i.e. Ext.2, only .07 acres of land in R.S. Plot No. 2543 was settled with Nalini Ranjan Dutta on Dar Raioti and thereafter the vendee Nolini Ranjan Dutta by a registered kabala dated2.5.1969 sold the property in favour of the plaintiff and the said Nilambor Chowdhury sold the remaining .07 acres of land in favour and Kalikbmar Paul on3.3.1937 by registered deed as such the entire .14 acres of land appertaining to R.S. Plot No. 2543 was sold out and from the materials on record it is also evident that Mutation Case No. 1044/69-70, the suit land was mutated in the name of the plaintiff after disallowing the objection raised by the defendant appellant and thereafter the plaintiff paid rent against the suit land and remained in possession of the suit land and from Ext. 6 series it also transpired that the name of the plaintiff has been recorded in the B.S. khatian and that R.S. Plot No. 2540 is the khas land of the Government and further even the defendant No.2, who deposed as D.W.2, in his cross-examination admitted that the patta granted by Nilambar Mohajan in favour of Nolini Ranjan Dutta is a genuine one and in that patta the R.S. Plot No. 2543 has been mentioned and further D.W.2 in his cross-examination also admitted that the suit land has been recorded in the M.R.R. khatian No.586 in the name of the plaintiff and the defendant No. 1  has no claim in the said suit land appertaining to M.R.R. khatian No. 586.<br/><br/>7. It also appears that the learned Additional District Judge, who heard the appeal, considering the documentary evi­dence similarly found that Nilambar Mahajan, the original owner of the suit property settled the same in favour of Nolini Ranjan Dutta by registered patta, Ext.2, and the adjacent R.S. Plot No.2540 the nature of which is a nal land is a khas land of the Government and the suit land was recorded in the name Nolini Ranjan Dutta and the plaintiff purchased the suit land by kabala dated 1.5.1969, Exbt. 3, and his name was duly recorded in the records of right and though an objection was raised by the defendant against the muta­tion of the name of the plaintiff but the same was disallowed and D.W. 1, the scribe of the above sale deed, stated that the dag number was inserted in the kabala wrongly and he wrote it on the advice of the defendant and that D.W.2 has admitted that he has no right, title and interest in the suit land and the R.S. Plot No. 2543 has been wrongly crept in his sale deed and the land in M.R.R. Khatian No.586 belonged to the plaintiff and he has no claim therein and considering that the defendant have disclaimed their title in the suit land and that the defendant tres­passed into the land of the plaintiff as has been established by report of the pleader commissioner, affirmed the judgment and decree passed by the trial court. The High Court Division considering that the impugned judgment and decree dated 21.11.1993 are judgment and decree of affirmance and are based on materials on record, declined to interfere with the same.<br/>We are of the view that the High Court Division on correct appreciation of the materials on record discharged the Rule and accordingly no interference is called for.<br/>The appeal is dismissed with costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
