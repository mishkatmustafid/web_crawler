Respon­dent No. 10, Md. Helaluddin challenged the notice dated 9th April, 1988 (Annexure—C to the writ peti­tion) directing a re-poll at Rajanagar Primary School Centre, Simulkandi Union Parishad, Upazila Bhairab.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong> After considering the report of the Presiding Officer and that of the Returning Officer which gave an appearance that the election was held peacefully the High Court Division set aside the order of Elec­tion Commission for re-poll. Respondent No.1 was also directed to publish the result of the election that was submitted by the Returning Officer.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> The appellant contends that the High Court Division was misled by the alleged reports of the Presiding Officer and the Returning Officer. He reit­erates what he had asserted before the High Court Di­vision. His case is that the election could not be held in Rajanagar Primary School centre; that as there was serious obstructions and interruptions at the time of the election the Presiding Officer adjourned the poll under Rule 29 of the Election Rules and sent a report to the Returning Officer; that in due course that report of the Presiding Officer was sent to the Election Commission, and, thereafter, the di­rection for re-election was passed by the Election Commission. It is further contended by the appellant that as there were contradictory reports with regard to the disputed poll the High Court Division ought not to have interfered in the matter.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> We find substance in the contention of the appellant. In the facts and circumstances of the case and in view of this Court's decision dated 19th Feb­ruary, 1989 in Civil Appeal Nos. 40, 38 and 29 of 1988 with Civil Appeal Nos. 2,3,4,5,8 and 17 of 1989 we hold that the High Court Division acted il­legally in interfering with the Election Commis­sion's order for re-election.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> In the result, the appeal is allowed. The judgment and order of the High Court Division, passed in Writ Petition No. 1120 of 1988, is set aside and the writ is re-called. No costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></span></div></div></div>
