The order impugned is the order of a learned Single Judge of the High Court Division dated 8 August 1985 in Civil Revision No. 147 of 1984 (Comilla).<br/><br/>2. The suit, T. S. No. No. 301 of 1979 in the Second Court of Munsif, Chandpur, was filed by the appellant alleging the following facts: The suit land measuring .31 decimals of an acre, recorded in C.S. Khatian No. 51 and comprising Plots Nos. 427 and 429, originally belonged to three brothers, Jugal Chand, Kala Chand and Adhar Chand in equal share. One Radhaballav Pal, proprietor of a business firm, purchased the suit land in auction in Money Suit No. 273 of 1937 of the Second Court of Munsif, Chandpur. Jadhulal Banikya, son of Jugal Chand, purchased the land as benamdar of the plaintiff by a registered kabala dated 12 August 1947 and went into possession. The land was under requisition by the Government from 1949 to 1976; part of the requisitioned land was de-requisitioned in 1971 and its pos­session was delivered to the plaintiff, and the remain­ing part, on de-requisition, was also delivered to him in 1976. Plaintiff filed T.S. No. 314 of 1976 in the Second Court of Munsif, Chandpur, against the heirs of Jadhulal for a declaration that Jadhulal was his benamdar in respect of the suit land and obtained a compromise decree and in pursuance of the said de­cree the plaintiff mutated his name by filing Muta­tion Case No. 6 of 1970-71. But at the instance of some interested persons who made unsuccessful at­tempts to establish their claim to the land the Addi­tional Deputy Commissioner and other officers in-charge of Enemy Property (defendants Nos. 1, 2 and 3) started the Vested Property Case in 1979, as stated above, declaring the suit land an enemy and vested property and issued a notice upon the plaintiff asking him to vacate it. In these circumstances, the plaintiff filed the suit for declaration that the Vested Property case was collusive, void and also for a permanent in­junction restraining the defendants from disturbing his full possession.<br/><br/>3. Two sets of defendants contested the suit by filing separate written statements. Defendants Nos. 1-3 are Additional Deputy Commissioner, Assistant Custodian, Vested Property, Comilla and Sub-Divisional Officer; in this appeal they are respon­dent Nos. 7, 8 and 9. Their case is that in the auc­tion-sale m 1937 only 1/3rd share of the suit land was purchased by Radha Ballav which was the share of Jugal Chand, one of three original owners. This 1/3rd share was purchased back by Jugal Chandra's son Jadhulal himself by the registered kabala dated 12 August 1947 with his own money and for his own benefit; he was not a benamdar of the plaintiff who was never the real purchaser but he fraudulently put up this claim to grab the property taking advan­tage of the absence of the original owners and their heirs who migrated to India before 1965. The suit land being enemy property was rightly treated as such and the Vested Property Case No. 66 of 1978-79 was filed accordingly to take possession of the prop­erty. Case of the other set of the Defendants, Nos. 4-9, (who are respondents Nos. 1-6 in this appeal) is practically the same as that of defendants Nos. 1-3 ex­cept in respect of 7 decimals of the suit land. This small portion of the suit land defendants, 4-9, claimed to have purchased from the heirs of Kala Chand and Adhar Chand, two of the original owners; excepting this portion they supported the claim of the Vested Property officials that the suit land is an enemy property for the recovery of which, the Vested Property Case has been rightly filed.<br/><br/>4. The trial Court decreed the suit upon a finding that the plaintiff acquired title and also got possession in the suit land on the basis of benami purchase in the name of Jadhulal which was con­firmed by the decree in T.S. No. 314 of 1967 which remained unchallenged in any higher forum. The ap­pellate Court, namely the Subordinate Judge, re­versed this finding, found that only 1/3rd of the suit land out of .31 decimals representing Judgal Chand's share was purchased by the registered kabala dated 12 August 1947, Ext. 2 corresponding to Ext. B (1) which is its certified copy and that it was not a bena­mi purchase but Jadhulal himself purchased it with his own money and that the plaintiff was not his benamdar but his claim was false. As to the decree in favour of the plaintiff in T. S. No. 314 of 1967, the appellate Court held that it was not binding upon the defendants as they were not parties thereto. Further, the appellate Court found that by mutilating the registered kabala (Ext. 2) by tearing it off in selected places, with a view to establish his false claim to the entire suit land, the plaintiff practiced fraud upon the court. The Vested Property Case was held to have been rightly instituted as owners of the land left for India before 1965. In revision the High Court Division found nothing to interfere with these find­ings.<br/><br/>5. Mr. T. H. Khan, learned Counsel for the ap­pellant, does not seriously dispute the finding that only 1/3rd of .31 decimals of the suit-land, recorded in C. S. Khatian No. 51, was purchased by the auc­tion-purchaser Radhaballav in 1937 and that this very 1/3rd share was re-purchased in 1947 under the registered kabala, Ext. 2, of which Ext. B (1) is the certified copy. He, however, maintains that this por­tion was purchased by the appellant in the benami of Jadhulal and that since then the entire suit land has been in possession of the appellant in whose favour the suit land was de-requisitioned by the Govern­ment. Learned Counsel has argued that the appellant got his title to the suit land on the basis of benami purchase which was also established by the decree in his favour in T.S. No. 314 of 1967 by which Jadhulal's heirs are bound. He has pointed out that Jadhulal's son, Shaktipada was not only party to that de­cree but he is still in Bangladesh and is supporting the appellant's case of benami transaction. The learned Counsel contends that the appellant was enti­tled to a decree at least to the extent of 1/3rd share of the suit land and further that since the appellant has been in possession of the entire suit land, an ejmali property, the attempt to oust him without legal par­tition is unwarranted.<br/><br/>6. It appears that seven heirs of Jadhulal in­cluding Shaktipada were defendants in T.S. No. 314 of 1967 and the suit was decreed on compromise but in the compromise only Shaknipada was a party. He is of course bound by the decree, but he being only one of the seven heirs of Jadhulal, the compromise decree does not cover the whole 1/3rd share, as shown in kabala Ext. 2 Mr. Moksudur Rahman, learned counsel for respondents Nos. 7-9 namely, the Vested Property officials, has submitted that the im­pugned Vested Property Case is limited to about 20.4 decimals of the suit land representing 2/3rd share of the original .31 decimals of land and that this 2/3rd share became enemy/evacuee property by operation of law when heirs of the original owners migrated to India before 1965. The learned Counsel has submitted that the Vested Property Officials do not intend to disturb the appellant's possession in his share. But it is not ascertained what is the appel­lant's share nor is it clear whether the 1/3rd of the suit land representing original owner Jugal Chand's share, has been included in the Vested Property Case. Determination of the appellant's lawful share in the suit land is not an issue in this suit. It is a suit for declaration that the Vested Property Case is illegal, collusive and void. Now that the appellant is not found to have title to the entire suit land the greater part of which is in fact an enemy and vested property the appellant-plaintiff is not entitled to a decree he prayed for. He may seek remedy by way of partition in an appropriate forum. Decision of the High Court Division affirming that of the Appellate Court is perfectly correct.<br/>In the result, the appeal is dismissed without however any order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
