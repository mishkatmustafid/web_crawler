Joynul Abedin J. -</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 25.10.2005 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 243 of 1987 discharging the rule.<br/><br/>2. The case of the plaintiff, in short, is that the suit jama appertains 25 decimals of land originally belonged to Banomali Das to the extent of eight anas share, Ramesh Chandra Das to the extent of four annas share, Harendra Nath Das and Babu Ram Das to the extent of two anas each. Banomali Das died leaving behind three sons defendant No.1, Surendra Chandra. The defendant No. 2, Taruni Chandra and Ramesh Chandra. Ramesh Chandra died leaving behind his brother Surandra Chandra and Taruni Chandra as his heirs. The anoth­er co-sharer, recorded tenant Ramesh Chandra also died leaving behind his son Manoj Kumar Das, the defendant No.3; Babu Ram died leaving behind two sons, Manindra Nath Das, the defendant No.8, and Fanindra Nath Das. Fanindra died unmarried and as such his share devolved upon his full brother, the defendant No.8. Harandra Nath Das died leaving behind his widow Charubala Das who inherited his share. There exits a path way in the middle of the suit plot stretching north-south and is about 4 cubit in measurement in width. The defendant Nos.1-3 is pos­sessing the northern part of the suit plot for a period of more than 25-26 years. The defendant Nos.1-3 sold out some portion of their share to the defendant Nos. 4, 5 and 6 Charubala, the widow of Harendra Nath sold out her entire share to the defendant No.7 and delivered possession. The defendant No. 8, Manindra has sold out 4½ decimals of land to the plaintiff by a registered deed of kabala dated 25.2.1975 and delivered posses­sion. The plaintiff has been possessing the land since the date of kabala. But in the middle of Ashhin 1384 Bangla Shal, the defendant No.1 in collusion with the defendant Nos.2-3 and at the instance of the defendant No. 6 enclosed insider the land of the plaintiff and constructed a chala ghar and thus illegally dispos­sessed the plaintiff from the suit land and the defendants refused to remove those chala ghar from the suit land and hence the suit.<br/><br/>3. The defendant No.7 entered appear­ance and filed an application for sepa­rate saham contending, <em>inter alia,</em> that the recorded tenant Harendra Nath Das having his share to the extent of two anas, died leaving behind his only widow Charubala. And this defendant has purchased the entire two anas share measuring 5 decimals of land from Charubala, the said widow of Harendra Nath by registered deed of kabala dated 8.3.1975 at appropriate consideration. Charubala delivered possession to the defendant No. 7 who constructed dwelling house from south-west corner of the plot in question and has been pos­sessing by paying rent to the Government since purchase and as such the defendant No.7 is praying for sepa­rate saham in respect of the said land.<br/><br/>4. The defendant Nos.1-4 have contest­ed the suit by filing joint written state­ment denying all the material allegation as set forth in the plaint. The case of the defendant Nos.1-4, in short, is that Banamali was the owner to the extent of eight anas share, Ramesh Chandra Das was the owner to the extent of four anas share and Harendra Hath and Babu Ram Das were the owner to the extent of two anas share in each of the plot in question as it was stated in the plaint. There is a path way dividing the plot in the middle extending to north south for easy move­ment of the co-sharers. The defendant No.1 as the heir of Banomali is possess­ing the share of Banamali from the northern side of the plot, both sides of the path way. The defendant No.3 Monoj Kumar, the son of the recorded tenant Ramesh Chandra sold out his share to the defendant Nos. 5-6. The defendant No.6 sold out his purchased land to Faku Ram. The defendant No.8, the heir of the recorded tenant Babu Ram Das and the defendant No. 5 have been possessing their respective share. The defendant Banamali died leaving behind three sons, Surendra Nath Das, the defendant No.1, Taruni Chandra Das, the defendant No.2 and Ramesh Chandra Das. The recorded tenant Ramesh Chandra died leaving behind his son Manoj Kumar Das, the defendant No.3. The defendants Nos.1-3 have got right, title and possession to the extent of two anas eight pies. The recorded tenant Ramesh Chandra Das died his four anas share was inherited by the defendant Nos.1-3, Harendra Nath Das and Babu Ram Sas. The defendant Nos.1-3 have got share together to the extent of one ana four pies share from Ramesh Chandra while Harendra Nath and Babu Ram have got the share to the extent of one ana four pies from Ramesh Chandra. The defendant Nos.1-3 have got the share to the extent of one ana four pies from Ramesh Chandra while Harendra Nath and Babu Ram have got the share to the extent of 5 1/3 pies each from Ramesh Chandra. Harendra Nath Das became the owner of the share to the extent of 2 anas+1 ana 4 pies= 3 anas 4 pies. Harendra died leaving behind two paternal Uncle's son, the defendant Nos. 1-2 and one widow Charubala who has got life interest in the property left by her husband. Thereafter Charubala died and as such, the defendant Nos. 1-2 have inherited Harendra having share to the extent of 1 ana 8 pies each left by Harendra. Thus the defendant Nos. 1-2 have got the share to the extent of 2 anas 8 pies+5 1/3 pies+1 ana 8 pies= 4 anas 9 1/3 pies each from the said jama. Taruni Chandra Das, the defendant No.2 died leaving behind his full brother, the defendant No.1 to inherit him. Thus the defendant No.1 became the owner of 9 anas 62/3 pies. The defendant No.1 has sold out 2½ decimals of land through two deeds of kabala to the defendant No.4 and delivered possession. Thereafter surendra Nath died leaving behind three sons and one widow, the defendant Nos.1-1(Ga), who are the owner of 12 1/2 deci­mals of land deducting the sold property measuring 2 ½ decimals of land in favour of the defendant No. 4 and these defendants are praying for separate saham.<br/><br/>5. The defendant No.5 has prayed for separate saham contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the defendant No.3 sold out 1½ decimals of land to the defendant No.5 by registered deed of kabala dated 2.8.1975 and delivered possession. By constructing dwelling house, this defen­dant is residing therein.<br/><br/>6. The learned trial Judge while trying the suit framed as many as seven issues as to whether the suit is maintainable in its present form, whether the suit is barred by limitation and by principle of waiver, estoppels and acquiescence and by principle of adverse possession, whether the suit is valued and stamped properly; as to whether the plaintiff has got any right, title and interest over the suit land; whether the suit is bad for defect of parties; whether the plaintiff is entitled to get relief as prayed for and whether the plaintiff is entitled to get any other relief.<br/><br/>7. In course of trial, the plaintiff and the defendants have adduced witnesses in support of their respective claim. The learned trial judge upon careful consid­eration of all the evidence both oral and documentary and other materials on record passed the judgment and decree dated 23.2.1984 granting saham to all the parties including the plaintiff. The learned trial Judge found that the defen­dant No.7 has got right, title and posses­sion over 5 decimals of land as such he would get saham in respect of the same.<br/><br/>8. The defendant No.1 being dissatisfied preferred Title Appeal No.28 of 1985 before the learned District Judge, Bogra. On transfer, the same was heard by the learned Additional District Judge, Bogra who by taking erroneous view affirmed the judgment and decree as passed by the trial court in part, with modification. The lower appellate court found that the defendant No.7 has got no right, title and interest in the suit jama because he could not prove that Charubala due to her legal necessity transferred the prop­erty by the registered deed of kabala dated 8.3.1975 to defendant No.7 and as such he will not get any saham. It was also found that the defendant Nos. 3-8 will not be entitled to get any saham.<br/><br/>9. Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the aforesaid judgment and decree the defendant No.7 preferred Civil Revision No. 243 of 1987 in the High Court Division. After hearing the High Court Division discharged the rule. Thereafter being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the judgment and order of the High Court Division the petitioner filed this civil petition for leave to appeal.<br/><br/>10. Abdul Quayum, the learned Senior Advocate for the petitioner sub­mits that kabala deed dated 8.3.1975 duly executed and registered by Charubala, marked as exhibit A-1, the recital of which is the best evidence of legal necessity for alienation which clearly shows that for the purpose of Sraddhya and for offering pindi at Gaya of her deceased husband Harendra Chandra Das, such alienation took place, non-consideration of such factual and legal proposition led the single Judge of the High Court Division to commit error in law which resulted in miscarriage of justice. He lastly submits that admittedly the suit is brought for the relief for declaration of title, recovery of khas possession against the defendant Nos.1-3 and for partition. No allegation against the kabala dated 8.3.1975, the exhibit mark A-1, was raised by either party to the suit. And as such the alien­ation was made by Charubala on the ground of legal necessity as it is evident from the recital of exhibit A-1 and the same not being controverted the single Judge of the High Court Division erred in law in not granting saham in favour of the petitioner, the heirs of the defendant No.7, which has resulted in miscarriage of justice.<br/><br/>11. We have heard the learned Advocate and perused the connected papers including the impugned judgment. We do not find any substance in the points raised. The High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials on record has arrived at a correct decision. We therefore find no interference with the same.<br/>Accordingly, the petition is dis­missed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
