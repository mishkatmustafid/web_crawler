The facts leading to these appeals are that one MA Naser, a Film Producer and Distributor in the then East Pakistan, took a loan of Tk. 40,000/- from the House Building Finance Corporation, de­fendant No. 1, in 1964 and constructed a residential house on his plot No. 8, Block No. N/W(J) Gulshan Model Town, Dhaka (Property in suit). Defendant No. 1 filed Miscellaneous Case No. 88 of 1976 in the Court of District Judge, Dhaka under Article 27 of President's Order No. 7 of 1973 for the realisation of loan money against MA Naser, the loanee and 2 others i.e. Dhaka Improvement Trust (Defendant No. 3) and the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Public Works (defendant No. 2) and the said case was decreed <em>ex parte</em> on 21.9.1977. Thereafter, in pursuance of the said decree, Money Execution Case No.7 of 1978 was filed by the decree-holder (House Building Finance Corporation) and in the said Execu­tion case the mortgaged property (suit property) was sold in auction on 30.4.1985 by the District Judge, Dhaka at a price of Tk. 34,62,500/- and defendant No. 4 auction purchased the same. The auction sale has been confirmed on 27.12.1986 and the sale Cer­tificate has been issued by the District Judge, Dhaka on 18.1.1987 in favour of the auction purchaser who had to pay in total Tk. 41,13,750/00.<br/><br/>3. The plaintiffs filed Title Suit No. 555 of 1985 in the First Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka which was, on transfer, re-numbered as Title Suit No. 269 of 1987 in the 3rd Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka. There were three main prayers of the plaintiffs in the said suit which are as follows:<br/>(a) that a decree declaring that the plaintiffs are the sole legal heirs and successors of late MA Naser and as such they are the sixteen annas owners of the suit property.<br/>(b) that a decree declaring that the decree/ order passed in Miscellaneous Case No. 88 of 1976 on 21.9.1977 is illegal, null and void be­ing obtained against a dead man by practising fraud upon the court and by suppression of the process of the court may be passed.<br/>(c) that a decree declaring that the auction sale was irregularly and fraudulently held and as such it was null and void may be passed.<br/><br/>4. Plaintiffs' case, briefly, is that plaintiff No.1 is the wife, plaintiff No.2 is the son and plaintiff Nos.3-4 are the daughters of MA Naser who is untraceable since 16.11.71 and hence presumed to be dead. Naser was a Non-Bengali domiciled in erst­while East Pakistan after the creation of Pakistan in 1947 and had been living with the plaintiff No.1 af­ter his marriage with her on 16.1.1963 at 43, Rankin Street, PS Sutrapur, Dhaka. After the 25th March, 1971, Naser shifted from 43, Rankin Street to House No. 4/13 Humayun Road, Mohammadpur, Dhaka. On 16.11.1971 Naser started from the resi­dence towards his place of business at Gulshan as usual, but did not come back to his residence even late at night or at any time afterwards. Plaintiff No.1 searched for Naser at every probable place includ­ing the residences of his known friends and relatives but his whereabouts could not be known. It was con­cluded for certain that MA Naser must have been killed in the liberation struggle of Bangladesh.<br/><br/>5. After the liberation of Bangladesh on 16.12.71, plaintiff No. 1 with her children shifted from Mohammadpur area and started living at 643, Bara Maghbazar, Dhaka. Thereafter the plaintiffs shifted to plot No. 8, Block No. N/W(J), Gulshan Model Town, the suit house, where they have been residing till to-day. Naser never returned to his family.<br/><br/>6. MA Naser took permanent lease of the suit property from the erstwhile Dhaka Improvement Trust by a deed of lease. He partly constructed a building thereon with the loan taken from the House Building Finance Corporation, defendant No.1 but could not complete the building owing to the dis­turbed condition in the country in 1970. The build­ing remained in an unfinished condition.<br/><br/>7. After the disappearance of MA Naser the plaintiffs were put to financial hardship and as such a number of instalments due to the House Building Fi­nance Corporation fell due. Defendant No.1 pressed hard for repayment of the loan money whereupon plaintiff No.1 requested the said defendant to allow, sufficient time to the plaintiffs for repayment of the outstanding loan money and also requested the said defendant to consider the case favorably in view of the tragic disappearance of Naser.<br/><br/>8. Plaintiff No. 1 also approached the Govern­ment of Bangladesh to intervene in the matter and as a result the Ministry of Public Works and Urban De­velopment by Memo No. 29 dated 12.6.72 requested the Secretary of House Building Finance Corporation to consider the case of Plaintiff No.1 favorably. De­fendant No. 1 received Tk. 9,912.48 paisa on 22.5.74, Tk. 1,467.06 paisa on 28.2.75 and Tk. 1,467.06 paisa on 31.3.76 from Plaintiff No. 1 by way of payment of loan instalment, plaintiff No.1 also spent a sum of Tk. 24,046.77 towards the development of the land and construction of the building in 1972 and 1973.<br/><br/>9. In the meantime defendant No.1 without waiting for the repayment of loan money by the plaintiffs in reasonable instalments filed Miscellane­ous Case No.88 of 1976 before the District Judge, Dhaka without impleading either the plaintiffs who were known to defendant No.1 as the wife and chil­dren of MA Naser or the surety of Naser and obtained an <em>ex parte</em> order/decree by suppressing the process of the court at the instance of some motivated party who was after the property of Naser. Defendant No.1 then put the said decree to execution in Money Ex­ecution Case No.7 of 1978 in the Court of District Judge, Dhaka behind the back of the plaintiffs.<br/><br/>10. On 24.2.1980 the plaintiffs came to learn about the said fraudulent transactions of defendant No.1 when a sale proclamation of the suit property was published in the daily Bangladesh Observer. Af­ter inspecting the case records through Advocates the plaintiffs finally came to know about the Miscella­neous Case No.88 of 1976 and the Money Execu­tion Case No.7 of 1978. The decree had been passed against a dead man and without impleading the plain­tiffs. The suit property was sold in collusion with the auction purchaser-defendant No.4 and the staff of the Court. The present value of the suit property will be not less than Tk. 60,000/- but because of the collusion between the auction-purchaser and the staff of the Court it was sold at a much lower price.<br/><br/>11. Defendant Nos.1 and 4 i.e. respondent Nos.1 and 2 in CA 68/89 contested the suit by fil­ing separate written statements and denying com­pletely the averments of the plaintiffs. The case of both the contesting defendants, <em>inter alia,</em> is that the suit is barred by limitation both under Articles 11(1) and 95 of the First Schedule to the Limitation Act. It was denied that plaintiff No.1 was the legally married wife of MA Naser or that the plaintiff Nos. 2-4 were the children of said Naser. The Kabinnama relied upon by plaintiff No.1 is a false, fictitious and forged document. The signatures of MA Naser in the so-called Kabinnama differs from his admitted signatures in the mortgage document and other pa­pers lying with defendant No.1. The story of Nasser’s disappearance on 16.11.1971 was denied. It was em­phatically stated that the plaintiffs never applied to defendant No.1 to be substituted as the heirs and successors of Naser. The plaintiffs may have paid some loan instalments but it was contended that ac­ceptance of deposit of loan instalments did not con­stitute recognition of heirship and successorship. As the plaintiffs never applied to be substituted as heirs and successors of Naser defendant No.1 did not make them parties in Miscellaneous Case No. 88 of 1976.<br/><br/>12. It has been asserted by defendant No.1 that MA Naser is not dead but that he is alive, and defendant No.1 had come to know from a reliable source that MA Naser was living in Karachi with his wife, son and daughters and that he was doing his business there.<br/><br/>13. It has been alleged that the plaintiffs have created some documents in order to grab the suit property. Defendant No.4 claimed that she is the lawful owner of the suit property by way of auction purchase from the Court. On 31.12.87 defendant No.4 filed an application for adoption of the written statement of defendant No.1 which was allowed by the Court by Order No.58 dated 2.1.88.<br/><br/>14. The learned Subordinate Judge framed the following issues:<br/>1. Is the suit maintainable in its present form?<br/>2. Is the suit barred by limitation and hit by PO 7/73?<br/>3. Is the impugned order/decree passed by the learned District Judge in Miscellaneous Case No. 88/76 and the impugned auction sale in re­spect of the suit property illegal, fraudulent and were they passed and held against a dead man MA Naser?<br/>4. Are the plaintiffs entitled to get the de­cree of declaration for their sixteen annas ownership in the suit property and are they the legal heirs of Abu Naser?<br/>On the question of maintainability and limita­tion the learned Subordinate Judge found against the plaintiffs.<br/><br/>15. As to the other issues, the learned Subor­dinate Judge held that the plaintiffs have not succeed­ed in establishing their claim that Abu Naser is dead and on their (Plaintiffs) failure to prove the factum of death of Abu Naser, no ownership can accrue in favour of the plaintiffs as the legal heirs of Abu Nas­er inasmuch as defence side has shown that Abu Naser in question is still alive and in the legal heirship. So long as the said Abu Naser is alive, the presump­tive heirs or the heir apparent like the plaintiffs can­not have absolute ownership in respect of the suit property. Accordingly the suit was dismissed by judgment and decree dated 23.6.88.<br/><br/>16. Plaintiffs then took the appeal, FA. No 46/88, to the High Court Division, Dhaka against the said Judgment and decree.<br/><br/>17. From the impugned judgment it appears that the learned Judges of the High Court Division agreed with the findings of the trial Court that the suit was barred by limitation. Being confronted with this difficulty the learned Advocate for the plaintiff-appellants offered to forgo the main reliefs prayed for in the plaint (in order to get over the difficulty of limitation) and submitted an application for amend­ment of the plaint on the date of delivery of judg­ment (sworn by the appellants on the day before) praying that the words (a)" and as such they are the sixteen annas owners of the suit property" in para­graph 26(a) of the plaint be deleted (b) that the prayers as in paragraphs 26(b) and 26(c) shall be de­leted and (c) that the prayers as in paragraphs 26(d) and 26(e) shall be renumbered as paragraphs 26(b) and 26(c) respectively."<br/><br/>18. As amended the only prayer of the plain­tiff-appellants in the suit which survived was for a declaration that the plaintiffs are the sole legal heirs and successors of late MA Naser.<br/><br/>19. The contesting respondents neither opposed the amendment of the reliefs nor contested the only is­sue which fell for determination after amendment.<br/><br/>20. The learned judges held that the amended prayer was not barred by any law of limitation or by any special statute and proceeded to decide the same on merit. Referring to section 108 of the Evidence Act which provides that when the question is wheth­er a man is alive or dead, and it is proved that he has not been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of him if he had been alive, the burden of proving that he is alive is shifted to the person who affirms it, the learned Judges upon a consideration of the evidence adduced by the plain­tiffs held that it was satisfactorily proved that MA Naser has not been heard of for more than seven years by those who would naturally have heard of him if he had been alive. The burden of proving that MA Naser is alive, it was held, thus shifted to the defendants and on consideration of their evidence, it was found that they have not been able to prove the same and the presumption of death has not been rebutted.<br/><br/>21. It was ultimately found "that the plaintiffs have been able to prove that MA Naser married the plaintiff No. 1 in 1961 and plaintiff Nos. 2-4 were the legitimate children of MA Naser and plaintiff No.1. The plaintiffs have also proved that MA. Naser has not been heard of since 16.11.71. They have also proved that he has not been heard of for more than 7 years by those who would naturally have heard of him if he had been alive. We, there­fore, draw the legal presumption that MA. Naser is dead. "Accordingly the suit was decreed as amended, by the impugned judgment, in that it was declared that the plaintiffs are the sole legal heirs and succes­sors of late MA Naser. In the penultimate paragraph of the Judgment it has been observed thus: "From all accounts, the fate that the plaintiff appellants now suffer from this suit is, to say the least, unfortunate. They are now being driven out of a property which could have been legally theirs. For a paltry sum of Tk. 70/72 thousand, the valuable suit property has been auction sold for Tk. 34,62,500/-. The appel­lants are at least entitled to that amount minus the dues of the defendant No.1."<br/><br/>22. The plaintiffs obtained leave to appeal from the impugned judgment on 9 July, 1989 on the ground that having regard to the findings made by the High Court Division itself there was a patent il­legality in the said judgement in that a decree against a dead man without impleading his heirs which was a nullity has been ignored and allowed to remain val­id and that this court should interfere to undo the said wrong and do complete justice having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case.<br/><br/>23. Defendant No.4 (as also defendant No.1) who did not put up any contest to the amended prayer of the plaintiffs in the appeal having noticed the plaintiffs' move, which in the course of hearing has been described by her learned counsel" as an act of breach of faith", herself came up with a prayer for leave to appeal against the same judgement as a counter-measure which was granted on August 30 1989. Defendant No.4 now questioned the propriety of the finding made by the High Court Division that Naser was dead. It was also contended that in the ab­sence of any evidence that Naser had died at any lime before the decree was passed on 21.9.77 in Misc. Case No. 88/76 it could not be said in any case that the decree was a nullity.<br/><br/>24. Dr. Kamal Hossain, learned counsel for the plaintiff-appellants (in CA. 68/89), has submitted that in view of the clear finding of the High Court Division that MA Naser is dead and that the plain­tiffs are the legal heirs of said MA. Naser, the decree passed in Misc. Case No. 88/76 against MA. Naser without impleading the appellants is a nullity and of no legal effect. Dr. Kamal Hossain argued that even though the particular date as to the death of Naser could not be proved, it may be presumed having re­gard to the then prevailing circumstances that Naser, a non-Bengali, must have been killed on or about 16.11.71 since when he became untraceable. In this connection he referred to M. Monir's Law of Evi­dence (Pakistan Edition) Vol. 11 (1974) 1084 and Sarker's Law of Evidence 12th Edition 937. It has been argued that at any event the Money Execution Case No.7 of 1978 which was started on 1.12.78 af­ter the expiry of seven years of disappearance of Nas­er and without impleading his heirs was wholly ille­gal and void. He referred to section 50 of the Code of Civil Procedure and <em><strong>AIR 1936 (Madras) (FB) 205 </strong></em>and<em><strong> AIR 1945 (Patna) (FB) 1</strong></em> in support of his contention.<br/><br/>25. The learned counsel for respondent Nos. 1 &amp; 2 i.e. defendants Nos. 1 and 4 respectively (in CA. 68 of 1989) vehemently argued that the plain­tiffs having voluntarily relinquished all their claims made originally in the suit except praying for a sim­ple declaration that they are the sole legal heirs of MA Naser by agreeing to amend the plaint, they are estopped/precluded from filing any appeal against the decree which they have obtained by their own choice and on the basis of consent and understanding with the defendant respondents. If has been submitted that the appellate decree was the result of a package deal between the parties and so the findings made by the High Court Division were not contested then. As to the argument now made that the decree was a nullity, the learned counsel contended that in the absence of any evidence that Naser had died before 21.9.77 (when the decree was passed) it could not be said in any case that the decree was passed against a dead man because there is no presumption as to the date of death within the period of seven years under sec­tion 108 of the Evidence Act which is a matter of evidence. The learned counsel in support of their submission referred to <em><strong>AIR 1926 (PC) 9, PLD 1962 (WP) Lahore 137 </strong></em>and other decisions. It has been argued, in view of the present plea of the plaintiffs, with equal vigour in the other appeal (CA 72/89) that the finding that Naser was dead was itself wrong and based on gross misappreciation of the evidence on record. The evidence of the DWs that Naser is alive and doing business in Karachi has been illegal­ly discarded, it is submitted.<br/><br/>26. We have considered the facts and circum­stances of the case in the light of the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties. It ap­pears to us that the objection raised by the learned counsel for the defendant-respondents as to the com­petence and propriety of the appeal by the plaintiffs assumes fundamental importance’s in view of the manner and circumstances in which the impugned judgment and decree were passed by the High Court Division. It has been noticed that the High Court Division concurred with the findings of the Subordi­nate Judge that the suit was barred by limitation and there is no further challenge to the said finding. The suit was, therefore, liable to be dismissed on that ground alone but in order to avoid a complete ship­wreck the plaintiffs, it seems, elected to give up all the reliefs prayed for in the suit and to limit their prayer to a declaration that they are the sole legal heirs of MA Naser. The contesting defendants, evi­dently complacent at nothing to lose, neither op­posed the prayer for amendment of the plaint nor the issue which was to be decided on the basis of the said amendment. That this was brought about on the basis of understanding and consent of the parties will be evident from the fact that the prayer for amend­ment was made on the date of delivery of judgment. The observation made by the High Court Division in this connection is also significant. It says: Both Mr. Mahfuzur Rahman and TH Khan (learned Advo­cates for defendants 1 and 4 respectively) have sub­mitted that the suit and the appeal can very well protected with the only remaining aforesaid prayer. They have the instructions of their respective clients that they will not enter any contest in this appeal with the appellants if the appellants limit their prayer to a declaration that they are the sole legal heirs and suc­cessors of late MA Naser. Accordingly they have not advanced any argument in this appeal either in re­spect of the appellant's only remaining prayer or in support of the findings of the learned Subordinate Judge that the plaintiffs have not been able to prove the death of MA Naser.<br/><br/>27. It is abundantly clear from the above that the decree which was passed by the High Court Divi­sion was for all practical purposes a consent decree, the plaintiffs having consciously given up their claim to the ownership of the suit property and ob­jection as to the decree passed in Misc. Case No. 88 of 1976 and the proceedings of Money Execution Case No.7 of 1978. The learned counsel for the re­spondents have referred to section 96(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure which provides that no appeal shall lie from a decree passed by the Court with the consent of parties. They have also invoked in aid the principle of Order II, rule 2(2) of the said Code which provides that where a plaintiff omits to sue in respect of, or intentionally relinquishes any portion of his claim, he shall not afterwards sue in respect of the portion so omitted or relinquished.<br/><br/>28. Mr. Maksum-ul-Hakim referred to <em><strong>AIR 1931 (PC) 107</strong></em> for highlighting the abhorrence of the judicial committee to consent decrees. The judg­ment of the Judicial Commissioners in that case was by consent of the parties and a plea was taken later on that there had in fact been no consent to the judg­ment and that the statement to that effect by the Ju­dicial Commissioners was a mistake. Upon consider­ing the facts of the case it was observed that "Under these circumstances which their Lordships have char­acterized not without reason as peculiar, it is impos­sible for them to accept without further question the affirmation by the judgment of the Judicial Commis­sioners that the decree they were about to pass was a decree by consent of parties. If it was so in fact, it clearly could not be challenged by way of appeal, and the certificate should have been refused".<br/><br/>29. Mr. TH Khan, learned counsel, also ap­pearing for defendant No. 4, sought to conjure up vividly as to why no resistance was given to the plaintiffs' limited prayer in the High Court Division. He submitted that the defendants did not object to the plaintiffs' prayer because the question of validity of the marriage between MA Naser and plaintiff No.1 was involved and it was realized that the plaintiffs' only anxiety before the High Court Division (in the suit) was to obtain a declaration for a legal and social stamp of legitimacy and recognition to them and to remain satisfied with the excess sale proceeds lying in deposit with the Court. Mr. Khan resolutely argued that the plaintiffs could not be allowed to agi­tate the same cause/causes which they had voluntari­ly abandoned and in the bargain secured a favourable decree for themselves with the passive assistance of the defendants but for which it may not have been possible. The plaintiffs are debarred by the principle of estoppel, even to file the present appeal, he sub­mitted. Mr. Khan referred to <em><strong>Halsbury's Laws of Eng­land, Third Edition, Volume 15 p.171</strong></em> where it has been said that on the principle that a person may not approbate and reprobate, a species of estoppel has aris­en which seems to be intermediate between estoppel by record and estoppel in pais. The principle that a per­son may not approbate and reprobate expresses two propositions; first, that the person in question, having a choice between two courses of conduct, is to be treat­ed as having made an election from which he cannot resale, and, second, that he will not be regarded, in general at any rate, as having so elected unless he has tak­en a benefit under or arising out of the course of con­duct which he has first pursued and with which his subsequent conduct is inconsistent.<br/><br/>30. <em><strong>In AIR 1956(SC) 593(601)</strong></em> an observation of <strong>Scrutton, LJ</strong> in <em><strong>Verschures Creameries Ltd. V. Hull and Netherlands Steamship Co. Ltd. (1921) 2 KB 608</strong></em> has been referred to which is very instructive: "A plaintiff is not permitted to 'approbate and repro­bate'. The phrase is apparently borrowed from the Scottish law, where it is used to express the principle embodied in our Doctrine of Election—namely, that no party can accept and reject the same instrument: <em><strong>Ker Vs. Wauchope (1819) 1 Bligh 1 (21); Douglas Menzies Vs. Umphelby 1908 AC 224 (232).</strong></em> The Doctrine of Election is not however confined to in­struments. A person cannot say at one time that a transaction is valid and thereby obtain some advan­tage, to which he could only be entitled on the footing that it is valid, and then turn round and say it is void for the purpose of securing some other advantage. That is to approbate and reprobate the transaction."<br/><br/>31. The Supreme Court then observed that "It is clear from the above observations that the maxim that a person cannot 'approbate and reprobate' is only one application of the Doctrine of Election, and that its operation must be confined to reliefs claimed in respect of the same transaction and to the persons who are parties thereto".<br/><br/>32. On the question of estoppel Mr. Khan has also referred to <em><strong>PLD 1971 (SC) 376 (390-391) </strong></em>in which <strong>Hamoodur Rahman CJ. </strong>observed thus:<br/>"The Doctrine of Estoppel is not confined to the matters dealt with under section 115 of the Evidence Act, for, as pointed out by <strong>Garth, CJ </strong>in the case of <em><strong>Ganges Manufacturing Co. Vs. Sourajmull, ILR 5 (Cal) 669</strong></em> "estoppels in the sense in which the term is used in the Eng­lish legal phraseology arc matters of infinite va­riety and are by no means confined to the sub­jects dealt with in Chapter VIII of the Evidence Act". It has been defined in Halsbury's Laws of England (2nd Edn), Vol. 13," as a disability whereby a party is precluded from alleging or proving in legal proceedings that a fact is other­wise than it has been made to appear by the matter giving rise to that disability". It is in this sense that it has often been held that even as a rule of evidence or pleading a party should not be allowed to approbate and reprobate."<br/><br/>33. All these principles, as noticed above, are found to be clearly applicable in the facts of the present case. Since the plaintiffs elected to relinquish all the reliefs except the one as noticed above appar­ently for saving the suit from limitation and to secure some benefit for themselves, they are bound by the Principle of Estoppel and cannot be permitted to argue for the same reliefs which have been voluntarily abandoned by them. The decree that has been obtained by them being otherwise based on understanding and consent of the parties as will be evident from the facts noticed above, they are not permitted on principle and authority to take any appeal from such consent decree. On the same principle, more or less, defendant No.4 is also barred from preferring any appeal from the im­pugned judgment. She has not, admittedly, put up any contest to the issue which was decided by the High Court Division; therefore, she also cannot be permitted to open a fresh front in this appeal and chal­lenge the findings which were not opposed. It is, however, understandable that she was obliged to file her appeal only when the plaintiffs had filed theirs.<br/>Having regard to the rationale upon which we have considered the present appeals it is neither ne­cessary nor right to enter into the question whether in view of the presumption under section 108 of the Evidence Act and the finding made by the High Court Division that the presumption of death of Naser could not be rebutted, the decree in Misc. Case No.88/76 was a nullity or the proceeding in Money Execution Case No. 7 of 1978 was void and similarly whether the findings made by the High Court Di­vision as to the death of MA Naser are correct or not. The parties must be left to be governed by the impugned judgment and decree as they are.<br/>In view of the discussion above, both the ap­peals are dismissed without any order as to costs.<br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
