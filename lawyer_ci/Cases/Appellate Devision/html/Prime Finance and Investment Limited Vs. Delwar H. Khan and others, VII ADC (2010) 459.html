It is further stated that the IPDC has filed a suit before the Artha Rin Court No.2 being Artha Rin Suit No. 206 of 2006 against the company and its shareholders for realization of sum of TK. 19,50,00,000.00 (Taka Nineteen Crore Fifty Lac only). This does not include the Term Loan and the Equity Investment loan. In fact the Company is liable to pay IPDC the total sum of TK. 27,46,14,667.00 (Taka Twenty Seven Crore Forty Seven Lac Fourteen Thousand Six Hundred and Sixty seven) including the Term Loan and the Equity Investment loan.<br/> <br/><strong>34.</strong> Mr. Khan Saifur Rahman, learned Counsel, appearing for the petitioner sub­mitted that the High Court Division ought to have considered that the loans dis­bursed to the company were secured and further thereto, the directors of the compa­ny furnished personal guarantees to the lender institutions including the petitioner for repayment of the loans and in such premises, the winding up of the company is neither warranted nor can it be solution either for the company itself or on the question of paying off its creditors propor­tionately and as such, the winding up of the company which is being used as a shield by some delinquent persons to secure their pilferage has been unwarrant­ed and in that view of the matter the impugned judgment and order is liable to be set aside; that after deliberate and fraudulent acts and omissions of respon­dent No. 1 and his cohorts in the company pushing it at the verge of its legal death resulting in consecutive yearly financial losses, the purposes of taking loans from the petitioner and other financial institu­tions and failing to utilizes/invest the same for running a prospective business like that of the company are palpably to misap­propriate and pilfer the public money and evidently the farce to get the company wound up had been devised and aimed at clearly to meet that end a long time ago by respondent No.1 and his cohorts and as such, the High Court Division ought not to have allowed the winding up of the com­pany allowing respondent No.1 and others getting away with the misappropriation and pilferage of such a huge amount of public money and in that view of the mat­ter. The learned Counsel further submitted that the High Court Division missed to notice that the respondent No.1 filed the application for winding up of the pro-forma respondent No.2 company without complying with or fulfilling any of the conditions as laid down in Section 241 of the Companies Act, 1994; that the respon­dent No.1 Delwar H. Khan being 66% share holder of the pro-forma respondent No.2 company and having full control over the management of the said company ought not to have obtained loan of crores of taka from as many as eight companies by suppressing facts during the period when the said company carrying on a very prospective business was shown to have gone through financial loss; that the pro forma respondent No.2 company was actually a one man show where the respondent No.1, Delwar H. Khan was the pioneer with 66% share who from the very commencement of his so-called business proceeded in an unfair manner so as to misappropriate public money and the High Court Division having come to a finding that it is indeed outrageous that huge amounts of money had been borrowed by the company from various financial institutions and no reasonable steps were taken to liquidate the debts. Serious questions arise as to the compe­tence and/or integrity of the persons who were involved in the management of the affairs of the company, the High Court Division ought not have allowed the said application for winding up respondent No.2 company while it is transparent that the respondent No.1 who misappropriated such a huge amount of public money. The learned Counsel finally submitted that the respondent No.1 with mala fide intention staidly while the ISP license of the compa­ny required renewal on payment of renew­al fee which expired on 29.11.2006 for default to render the company dysfunc­tional and get the company wound up and run away after misappropriating such a huge amount of public money.<br/> <br/><strong>35.</strong> It appears that huge amounts of money had been borrowed by the Company from various financial institutions and no rea­sonable step was taken to liquidate the debts. Serious question arise as to the competence and/or integrity of the persons who were involved in the management of the affairs of the company. However, the fact remains that the loan liabilities of the Company is in excess of TK. 18,21,70,000.00 (Taka eighteen crore twenty One lac and seventy thousand only) and that the Company is unable to pay its debts. Further the nationwide ISP Licence of the company having expired on 29.01.2006 the company has been ren­dered dysfunctional. The High Court Division considering the admitted position that the Company is unable to pay its debts coupled with the fact that in the absence of the ISP Licence the Company cannot carry on its business.<br/> <br/><strong>36.</strong> The High Court Division was also very much conscious of the broad fact of huge loan liabilities of the Company and was of the view that the same has to be put at halt and also considering the provision of section 241(v) (vi) of the Companies Act deemed it just and equitable that the Company should be ordered to be wound up. Accordingly allowed the application for winding up of the Company and appointed official receiver as the liquida­tor and passed other incidental orders.<br/> <br/><strong>37.</strong> In view of the above, we find no sub­stance in the submissions of the learned Counsel for the petitioner.<br/> <br/><strong>38.</strong> Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
