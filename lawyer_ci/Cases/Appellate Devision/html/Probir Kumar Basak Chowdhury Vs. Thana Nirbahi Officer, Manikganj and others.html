Tafazzul Islam J. -</strong> This petition for leave to appeal arises out of the judgment dated 14.1.2004 of a Single Bench of the High Court Division passed in Civil Revision No. 675 of 1997 discharging the Rule obtained against the judgment and decree dated 23.7.1996 in Title Appeal No.3 of 1991 of the learned Joint District Judge, 1st Court, Manikganj affirming those of dated 29. 11.1990 of the Court of Assistant Judge, Manikganj Sadar in Title Suit No. 425 of 1977 dismissing the suit.<br/><br/>2. The petitioner along with Giriza Shaha filed the above suit for declaration that the suit property is a debottor property and not khas property of the government and that the notice for eviction under section 92 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 being No. 4 of 1976-77 dated 28.10.1977 is illegal on the averments that two brothers, Mohendra and Lalit were the original owners of suit plot No. 28 measuring .31 acres under C.S. Khatian No. 63 in equal shares and by amicable partition. Mahendra possessed the eastern half and Lalit possessed the western Half; Lalit sold his share to Shashi Bhusan Chokraborty who then sold the same on 30.6.1943 to Raj an Mohan Basak, the predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiff; Ranjan Mohan Basek having died intestate leaving two daughters namely Devi Basak and Mrinalini Basak their names were duly recorded in S.A. Khatian together with the names of three sons of Mohendra in their eight anna shares of the suit Plot No. 28; the above Devi Basak and Mrinalini Basak were entrusted with the duty of looking after the due performance of the Sheba Puja of the family idol as their father Rajan Mohan Basak, during his life time in the year 1980, orally dedicated the entire suit property along with other property to the Deity; sometime thereafter Devi Basak and Mrinalini Basak left for India by relinquishing charge of Sheba Puja in favour of Jogmaya who was the only daughter of Debi Basak; Devi Basak and Mrinalini Basak died in India; thereafter the said Jogmaya was killed by the Pak-Army during the war of Liberation and then her son, the plaintiff No.1 had been performing the Sheba Puja as the shebait of the idol and possessing the property of the said idol; but on 28.10.1977 the then Sub-Divisional Officer, Manikganj treating the suit property as Khas land, served a notice ordering for eviction of Girija Shaha, the plaintiff No. 2 and the father of proforma respondents 16-17 herein, who was monthly tenant under plaintiff No.1 and hence the suit.<br/><br/>3. The defendant Nos. 1-4, who are the respondents No. 1-4 herein, along with the defendant No. 5, the predecessor of respondents 5-15 herein, contested the suit by filing two sets of written statement denying the material allegations made in the plaint and contending, <em>into alia</em>, that the S. A. recorded tenants left the suit property without paying any rents and accordingly Abandoned Case No. 437 of 1966 was started under section 92 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act 1950 and then by Order No. 14110 dated 30.12.1966 the suit property was treated as Khas property of the Government and out of the same .16 acre land was settled to A.T.M. Ayub by Settlement Case No. 163 of 1966 and .15 acres of land was settled to Kalimuddin Mia by Settlement Case No. 184 of 1966 and the above leaseholders also executed kabuliyat in favour of defendant No. 2 and since then they have been possessing the suit property by paying rents to the Government and the suit property is not debottor property and the plaintiffs have no title and possession over the suit land.<br/><br/>4. The learned Assistant Judge, after hearing, dismissed the suit. As against that the plaintiffs preferred Title Appeal No.3 of 1991 in the Court of learned District Judge, Manikganj and the learned Joint District Judge, First Court, Manikganj, after hearing, dismissed the appeal. The plaintiffs then moved the High Court Division and obtained Rule in Civil Revision No. 675 of 1999 and after hearing the High Court Division discharged the Rule.<br/><br/>5. We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and perused the judgment and order materials on record.<br/><br/>6.  As it appears the High Court Division discharged  the Rule  holding  that  in  the plaint the plaintiff No.1 described himself as "¯^qs †mevBZ c‡¶ kªx kªx †m j¶x bvivqb weMÖn msNai cvwUª," but in the plaint no relationship was disclosed as to the attachment of the plaintiff No. 2 with the deity and he was a simple tenant under plaintiff No. 1 and so it remained unexplained as to why instead of the Deity, Sree Lakshmi Narayan Bigraha, why two private individuals instituted the suit; in the plaint there are some descriptions of plaintiff No.1 relating to the deity but in respect of plaintiff  No. 2   there  is  no description  as  to  how he became  a  co plaintiff to get a declaration that the declaration that the suit property as debottor property; it is the settled principal of law that the Deity has a legal character and accordingly it can sue and be sued and can also maintain a suit but the Deity cannot move from one place to another place as such the Deity has to do every thing through next friend and all the affairs of the Deity are looked after by a shebayet, who in fact, performs the duty of manager and moreover in the memorandum of appeal the plaintiff No. 2 has been left out from the category of the appellant and this discrepancy shows that the plaintiffs do not know what is heir actual cause of action and further the Deity did not file the suit and some unscrupulous persons of different status, in their individual capacity, filed the suit and accordingly since the suit having been filed by two private individuals instead of the Deity itself, the suit is not maintainable and that regarding the question of existence of a Deity the entire case of the plaintiffs rests on oral dedication and although plaintiffs examined witnesses to prove the existence of a private Deity but the evidence on record shows that the private Deity was in the Chila Kotha of the homestead and there is no credible evidence to show as to when the Deity stepped to the courtyard of the house and P.W. 2 in his deposition stated that the suit land is low land and D.W.5 in his deposition stated there is a biscuit factory oh the suit land; the evidence of the witnesses of the plaintiffs also show that the Deity was shifted from the Chilakotha of the Western Building of the plaintiff No. 1 to the suit land in 1980-81 and the plaintiff No. 1, after selling his property, having no other place to live, constructed a house with a pucca latrine and pucca bath in the suit land where he, along with his younger brother and other family members are living and a society in the name of Jobath Songha was also situated on the suit land; the deposition of kalidas Majumder P.W.3 shows that plaintiff No. 1 used this land for his own benefit; exhibit Cha, the certified copy of the judgment of Title Suit No. 126 of 1967, showed that the suit land has been declared as Khas land of the Government and further Mohanta Rishi, the D.W.3, of the above suit deposed to the effect that he, as a drum bitter (Dhuli) by beating of drum served notice; the above suit was relating to other half the original owner of the suit property but the records showed that none raised any objection when the suit property of the said suit was made khas of the government under section 92 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act 1950; although the plaintiff of this suit was not a party to that suit' but in the case of <strong><em>Robert penaru vs. Habibur Rahman</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>8 BLC (AD) 115</em></strong> it has been that a judgment, whether inter parties or not, may be conclusive evidence against all persons of its existence, date and legal effect as distinguished from the accuracy of the decision rendered and in the case <strong><em>Anil Kumar Sarkar and others vs. Sree Sree Kalimata Bigraha</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>36 DLR 47</em></strong> cited by the learned Advocate for the petitioner, it was held that if there is no oral evidence available for long lapse of time regarding dedication of property for worship of a Deity then some documentary evidence, if available, is enough to establish the dedication but in the instant suit, the plaintiffs save and except stating that the dedication was made orally failed to adduce any evidence to prove that the suit property was dedicated to Deity; it is the case of the plaintiffs that dedication was made in the year 1956 and so this dedication is not so old to suggest that no materials could be available; the decision made in <strong><em>16 DLR (SC) 457</em></strong> is relating as to how a dedication or endowment is made and there is no disagreement with the proposition laid down in the above decision but since the plaintiffs failed to prove the dedication itself by any legal evidence the dedications is also of no help to the plaintiffs.<br/><br/>7.  We are of the view that the High Court Division, on proper consideration of the evidence and the materials on record arrived at the correct decision. The learned counsel could not point out any illegality or infirmity in the decision of the High Court Division so as to call for interference.<br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
