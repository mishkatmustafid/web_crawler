Since no power to grant interim relief is conferred either under section 4 or 6, the Administrative Tribunal or the Administrative Appellate Tribunal  can not grant interim relief.<br/> <br/><strong>Case Referred To-</strong><br/>Kamml Hasan Vs.

The Administrative Appellate Tribunal on consideration of the materials on record rejected the prayer holding that there is no provision either in the enactment or Rule of the Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980 for stay of any proceedings of the inferior tribunal.<br/><br/>3. We have heard Mrs. Sufia Khatun, the learned Advocate-on-Record for the petitioners and Mr. Md. Bashir Uddin Zindigir, the learned Advocate (appearing with the leave of the Court) for the respondent No.1 and perused the impugned judgment and order of the Administrative Appellate Tribunal and the materials on record.<br/><br/>4. This Division in a number of cases held that the Administrative Tribunal is not a Court proper although it has all the trappings of the Court and as such cannot exercise all the judicial powers of the Court provided under the Code of Civil Procedure. In the case of Kamrul Hasan Vs. Bangladesh and others reported in 49 DLR (AD)(1997) 44 this Division held that sections 4 and 6 of the Administrative Tribunals Act do not provide jurisdiction to the Administrative Tribunal or the Appellate Tribunal to grant any interim relief in respect of a is pending before it for final adjudication.<br/><br/>5. In the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that the Administrative Appellate Tribunal on proper consideration of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision.<br/><br/>6. The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
