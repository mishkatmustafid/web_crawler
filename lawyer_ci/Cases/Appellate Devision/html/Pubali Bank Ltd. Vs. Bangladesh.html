Ruhul Amin J. - </strong>This petition has been filed seeking review of the judgment dated August 1, 2005 passed in Civil Appeal No.85 of 1997 dismissing the same. The appeal was filed against the judgment dated April 10, 1997 of the High Court Division in Writ Petition No.3396 of 1991 discharging the Rule obtained therein. The writ petition was filed challenging the legality of the Memo. No. 1221 (5) J, M, 60 dated 14.12.1991 of the Office of District Magistrate, Chittagong issued under the signature of the Magistrate, 1st Class, Sadar, Chittagong addressed to the Deputy Police Commissioner, Sadar Head Quarter, CMP Chittagong requesting him for placing police personnel for eviction of the appellant, herein petitioner, from the property of M/S. Lazaf Commercial Corporation Ltd. at 40, Shaheed Saifudding Khaled Road, Chittagong.<br/><br/>2. The property in question was taken over by the Government as abandoned property. The petitioner accepting the property in question as an abandoned property applied to the abandoned property authority for lease of part of the property in question and the abandoned property authority leased out the property (part) in question to the petitioner herein. The owner of the property challenged the action of the Government in treating the property in question as abandoned property and finally it was adjudicated that the property is not an abandoned property. The abandoned property authority while in compliance of the judgment passed declaring the property not an abandoned property took step for handing over possession thereof upon evicting the lessee of the abandoned property authority the petitioner challenged the action of the abandoned property authority taken for evicting him (petitioner) from the property in question. The petitioner challenged the action of the abandoned property authority before the High Court Division in writ jurisdiction but without any success.<br/><br/>3. As against the judgment of the High Court Division the petitioner filed appeal. This Court dismissed the appeal upon observing "In the background of the mate­rials on record the undenied position is that the property in question i.e. the prop­erty possessed by the appellant and the other properties of the Respondent No.3 at one point of time although was taken over as abandoned property and managed by the abandoned property authority by allot­ting the same to the different organizations and person(s) including the appellant but the action of the abandoned property authority having been challenged by the Respondent No.3 and another it has been declared that the properties of the Respondent No.3 are not abandoned prop­erty and thereupon direction was made to release the property from the list of aban­doned property. As such the moment it was held that the properties of the Respondent No.3 are not abandoned prop­erty, the abandoned property authority under the law is duty bound to return the property to the claimant upon removing the encumbrance created by it i.e. upon taking over possession from m€ person to whom the abandoned property authority allotted the property of the Respondent No.3 while managing the same as abandoned property and that in performance of the said legal duty the step taken by the abandoned property authority reflected in  Annexure-D to the writ petition i.e. Memo, of the office of the Deputy  Commissioner, Chittagong dated 14.12.1991 has quite correctly been held legal by the High Court Division.<br/>4. The appellant's claim to retain possession as mortgagee is not legally sustainable since the mortgage as claimed by the appellant is an equitable mortgage.<br/><br/>The admitted position is that at one time the bank, as claimed by it, went into possession of the property in ques­tion, of which it was not in possession as mortgagee, to save the same from being damaged keeping in view its interest therein as mortgagee. In the background of the nature of the mortgage, i.e. equi­table mortgage, when the property was taken over by the abandoned property authority the appellant stepped down from its previous position and approached the abandoned property authority to allot the property in question to it and on the basis of such allotment the appellant was pos­sessing the property in question, but the moment the property has been declared as not abandoned property and thereupon while it became legal obligation and duty on the part of the abandoned property authority to restore possession of the prop­erty to the claimant of the property and that steps having been taken as in Annexure-D for discharging the said obli­gation and duty, the same cannot be con­sidered to have been taken without juris­diction or that the steps taken should not have been the one but there should have been different one because of the fact stat­ed hereinbefore. The action as has been initiated by the abandoned property authority being for restoration of posses­sion of the property which was taken over as abandoned property but later on declared by the Court not abandoned property to the authoritatively declared claimant/owner; the action of the Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 is quite legal and lawful. The contention of the appellant that the Respondent No.3 owes huge dues to the bank is not material in the context of the matter involved in the case brought by the appellant before the Court and that the question of taking loan by the Respondent No. 3 and the liability thereof, if any, to the Bank are extraneous matter in the context of the subject matter of the writ petition out of which the appeal has arisen and as such is not an issue for determination in the writ petition. The only issue before the Court is whether the step taken for restora­tion of possession, as in Annexure-D to the writ petition, i.e. the impugned annexure, is legal or not. As regard the liability, if any, in connection with the mortgage, claimed by the appellant the same would be matter for decision in some other forum but not in writ jurisdiction. As such bank is not legally entitled to retain possession of the property of the Respondent No. 3 on the said ground i.e. Respondent No.3 owes to the bank in connection with the mort­gage since in the case of the kind of mort­gage as claimed by the appellant the mort­gagee is not supposed to be in occupation of the mortgagor’s property.<br/><br/>5. We have heard the learned Counsel for the petitioner. On perusal of the petition filed seeking review of the judgment as mentioned hereinbefore it is seen that the same has not been filed on the ground that there is apparent mistake in the judgment sought to be reviewed or that the review petition has been filed on the discovery of new fact which could not be placed before the Court at the time of hearing of the appeal inspite of best effort. In that view of the matter we find that there is no merit in the petition filed seeking review of the judgment of this Court in the aforemen­tioned appeal. The learned Counsel sub­mitted that as a case is pending before the High Court Division relating to the prop­erty in question between the parties in the review petition and as such the petition for review may be kept pending till disposal of the case before the High Court Division since that would resolve the dispute between the parties once for all. The sub­mission so made is of no merit since as it appears in the background of the submis­sion made by the learned Counsel the issue involved in the case before the High Court Division for adjudication is quite different and distinct from the issue as was in the writ petition and thereafter in the appeal judgment whereof is sought to be reviewed. It further appears that the judg­ment sought to be reviewed has hardly any bearing on the subject matter of the case as stated by the learned Counsel of the petitioner pending before the High Court Division.<br/>In the background of the discussions made hereinbefore we find no substance in the petition.<br/>Accordingly the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
