Abdul Matin J. -</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 08.05.2008 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.3149 of 1998 revers­ing the judgment and decree dated 28.05.1998 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, Bagerhat in Title Appeal No.264 of 1995 reversing the judgment and decree dated 30.09.1995 passed by the learned Senior Assistant Judge of Mongla Thana in Title Suit No.80 of 1994.<br/><br/>2. The facts, in short, are that the respon­dent No.1 instituted Title Suit No.80 of 1994 on 29.11.1994 before the learned Assistant Judge, Mongla within the District Bagerhat for declaration of title in kha schedule land against the present petitioners.<br/><br/>3. The disputed land and other khas lands measuring 38.12 acres and the under raiyates of C.S. Khatian No. 224, 226, 227, 228 and 229 measuring 55.52 acres and altogether 93.64 acres were recorded in the name of Ram Dhan Bairagee, Lakhmikanto Bairagee, Pachu Ram Bairagee, Rajoni Bairagee each one anna, six gandos, two karas and two krantis, Dharmo Mondal two annas, thirteen gandas one kara, one kranti, Darikanath Mondal one anna, six gandos, two karas and two krantis, Pancho Ram Mondal one anna, six gandos, two karas and two krantis and Darikanath Dakua five annas, six gandos, two karas and two krantis.<br/><br/>4. Darikanath Dakua died leaving three sons namely Monorhar Dakua, Kamal Dakua, the proforma defendant No.8 and the plaintiff Ananda Dakua and they inherited their fathers share of C.S. Khatian No. 223 and possessed the same jointly and then Monohar Dakua died leaving no wife, sons and daughters and accordingly his share was devolved upon the other two brothers namely the plaintiff and proforma defendant No. 8 Kamal Dakua and the plaintiff from his own share transferred 2.30 acres of land to others and retained 4. 05 acres and possessed the same jointly with other co-sharers and the plaintiff constructed houses and possessed the same and the plaintiff paid rents to the ex-land lords and possessed the same openly and adversely for more than 30 years.<br/><br/>5. There is no dispute about C.S. Plot No. 382 measuring 2850 acres home­stead land and by amicable partition the plaintiff possessed C.S. Plot No. 381 and S. A. Plot No. 680 and this plot 3.7650 acres have been possessing by the plaintiff including agricultural land and the plaintiff in total possessed 4. 05 acres but during the S.A. operation the entire land as aforesaid was not record­ed in the name of the plaintiff and only 1. 0825 acres was recorded in the name of the plaintiff and the rest 2. 6825 acres of land was wrongly recorded in the name of the defendants more than their shares and that record is illegal and the plaintiff possessed the disputed 'kha' schedule land separately and the plain­tiff came to know about the wrong recordings on 20.11.1994 when the defendants denied the plaintiffs title upon the 'kha' schedule land which clouded the tile of the plaintiff and hence the plaintiff filed the suit for dec­laration of title simplicitor of ‘kha’ sched­ule land measuring 2.6825 acres.<br/><br/>6. The defendant No.1. 2. 5. 6. 7 filed written statement, jointly and they claimed that the suit is not maintainable in its present form, suit is barred by Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act and the defendants denied the material alle­gations of the plaint claiming that the cause of action dated 20.11.1994 is false and the court fee paid the specific claims of the defendants are that the landlords of C S. Khatian No. 223 were Nag and Mitra Babus and the tenants defaulted in paying rents and the landlords filed rent suit and that suit and that suit was decreed and the decree holders put the decree into execution and auction pur­chased the land for areas of rent and then the aforesaid land lords settled the land of C.S. Plot No.381 measuring 8.10 acres and C.S. Plot No. 382 meas­uring .57 acres in totals 8.66 acres in the Year 1359 B. S. after settling rents in the names of Shetal Mondal, Kamal chandra Dakua, plaintiff Ananda Chandra Dakua and the defendant No.7 Kalicharan Bairagee and delivered pos­session to them and thereafter again the rents of the aforesaid two plots fell due and the landlords filed rent suit No.75/ 53/ 76/ 53 and 77/ 53 against Shitol Mondal, Kamal Chandra Dakua, plain­tiff Ananda Chandra and Kalicharan Bairagee and the aforesaid four tenants amicably settled the claims of the landlords and the aforesaid four tenants right and tile upon the C. S. plot No. 381 and 382 were confirmed and then the plain­tiff and his brother Kamal Chandra Dakua on 19.06.1954 with the help of registered patta No.831 made settle­ment of land measuring 2. 64 of plot No.381 in favour of Sushil father of the defendant No.2 and 3 and at that time the plaintiff Anandra Dakua as member of the joint family executed and regis­tered the aforesaid patta No. 831 dated 19.06.1954 and delivered possession to the aforesaid, tenants and the names of the aforesaid tenants Sushil, the father of the defendant No.2 and 3, pulin Bihari defendant No.1, Malati Bala the defendant No.4 were not recorded in the S.A. Khatian and they filed Title Suit No. 520 of 1957 before the Second Munsif Court, Bagerhat and that suit was decreed on and in that suit the plaintiff Ananda Chandra Dakua who attained majority in the Year 1957 was the defendant No. 2 and decree holders filed Miscellaneous Case No. 537 68-69 under Section 54 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 before the Revenue department and opened the S. A. Khatian as S.A Khatian No.229/1 and the C.S. Plot No. 381 and S.A. Plot No. 680 measuring 5.10 acres of which 3.77 acres were wrongly recorded in other khatians and the plaintiff Ananda, the aforsaid Kamal, kalicharan and Sarola the wife of Shetal file Title Suit No. 523 of 1957 before the 2nd Munsif Court, Bagerhat and the suit was decreed and they cor­rected their names by filing Miscellaneous Case No.1165 under Section 54 of the State Acquisition an Tenancy Act, 1950 and the plaintiff him­self form the disputed land sold 19 acres of land on 27.08.1974 with the help of registered sale deed No. 1839 in favour of the defendant No.1 and 4 i.e. Pulin Bihari Bairagee and kalicharan Bairagee and after the death of Sushil his share was inherited by his two sons the defen­dant No. 2 and 3 i.e. Narayan Mondal sold .44 acres of land from the disputed plot along with other lands on 24.06.1989 with the help of registered sale deed No. 834 in favour of the defendant No. 6 Taif ali and the defen­dant No.4 Maloti Bala sold .88 acres of land on 07.04.1993 with the help of reg­istered sale deed No.534 to Abul kazi and Yanunj kazi the sons of defendant No. 6 and after taking settlement and purchasing land by the defendant No.1 pulin Bihari Bairagee and kalicharan Bairagee the papers were with the cus­tody of the landlords Nag and Metras and the plaintiff himself admitted the same in Title Suit No.523 of 1957 and the plaintiff never challenged the patta dated 19.06.1954 within twelve years from the date of attaining majority in the year of 1957 and the plaintiff instituted a false suit which was liable to be dis­missed with cost.<br/><br/>7. The trial court decreed the suit and on appeal the appellate court set aside the judgment and decree of the trial court and dismissed the suit and on revision the High Court Division set aside the judgment and decree of the appellate court and restored those of the trial court.<br/><br/>8. Being aggrieved by the judgment and order of the High Court Division the petitioners have filed this petition for leave to appeal.<br/><br/>9. Heard the learned Advocate and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/><br/>10. It appears that the trial Court on proper assessment of evidence decreed the suit. But the appellate court without averting to those finding set aside the judgment and decree of the trial court and dismissed the suit.<br/><br/>11. The trial Court found that the exhibits of the defendants related to C.S. khatian No. 224 and not the suit land which is C.S. Khatian No.223. Since it was not a proper judgment of reversal the High Court Division rightly set aside the appellate judgment and decree.<br/><br/>12. In such view of the matter we find no substance in this petition which is accordingly dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
