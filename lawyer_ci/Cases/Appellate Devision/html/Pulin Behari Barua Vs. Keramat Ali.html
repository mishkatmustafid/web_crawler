One Keramat Ali Sowdagar, predece­ssor of respondents 1(a) to 1(e) instituted a Redemption Suit No. 16 of 1965 in the 1st Court of Munsif, Patiya for redemption of mortgage of the disputed lands which, as des­cribed in two schedules, originally belonging to one Abdus Samad who mortgaged the lands to Ananda Charan Barua defendant No. 1, by executing two deeds of usufructuary mort­gage on May 29, 1924. Since then defendant No. 1 has been possessing the lands. The disputed lands were put to auction in Execution Case No. 189 of 1933 which was filed against Abdus Samad and others. One Purna Chandra Sarkar auction purchased the lands on Decem­ber 14, 1933 and took delivery of possession on August 20, 1935 through Court. On De­cember 1, 1940 he sold the lands to Abul Bashar and his mother Umda Khatun. On her death Abul Bashar and her husband Jalal Ahmed sold the lands to plaintiff-respondent on September 15, 1945. Thus plaintiff by claiming to have acquired the right of redemption of the mort­gage lands, approached defendants No. 1 for redemption as well as possession. But the defendant did not agree. He, therefore, filed the suit.<br/><br/>3. In his written statement defendant stated that he purchased the lands from Abdus Samad on July 19, 1936 in the benami of one Jaga Bandhu Barua and went into possession of the lands. He then filed O.S. No. 9 of 1959 against Jatish Baura, Jaga Bandhu Barua's son, who filed a solenama stating that his father was a benamdar of defendant No. 1. Defendant No.1 further contended that the Miscella­neous Case No. 116 of 1942 was filed against the plaintiff and others for the separation of jama of the disputed holding. As the plaintiff did not claim the rent of the lands in his share the jama was divided. By virtue of his pur­chase by the kabala and adverse possession for over the period of limitation the mortgage had been extinguished and, therefore, the plain­tiff had got no right of redemption.<br/><br/>4. The trial court decreed the suit. De­fendant No. 1 preferred other Appeal No. 385 of 1968 before the Subordinate Judge, 3rd Court, Chittagong who dismissed it with the modification that there would be no need of accounting of the usufructs. The Second Appeal No. 532 of 1970 was filed be­fore the High Court Division which was dismissed.<br/><br/>5. Leave to appeal was obtained by the defendant-appellant to consider whether the  High Court Division has correctly construed the documentary evidence in ascertaining the nature and cha­racter of the lands in question and also whether the  High Court Division correctly applied the provisions of section 26G of the Bengal Tenancy Act in view of the amendment of this Act in 1928, the contention was that the lands in question being raiyati and not occu­pancy raiyati were transferred on May 29, 1924 long before the occupancy raiyati interest were made transferable by the amendment.<br/><br/>6. Mr. M.H. Khondker, Counsel for the appellant, submitted that the disputed lands being raiyati and not occupancy raiyati were transferred by usufructuary mortgages on May 29,1924 but since at this date such transfer could not be validly made the application of the pro­visions of section 26G of the Bengal Tenancy Act to cover such transfer has been erroneous. Such interests were made transferable by an amendment of the Bengal Tenancy Act in 1928. His further contention was that as the holding comprising the lands in question were put to auction for default in the payment of rents and Purna Chandra Sarkar who is a stranger-purchaser auction purchased the same in money execution case, the mortgagor's right to re­demption came to an end and the auction pur­chaser acquired only the right to recover khas possession of lands as an abandonment of the holding or by annulment of the encumbrances and as he had not done so the auction pur­chaser could only exercise the right to sue for possession. The learned Counsel, therefore, submitted that the plaintiff-respondent who purchased from the auction purchaser did not, therefore, acquire any right in the disputed lands. Moreover, such right, if any, had been lost due to the lapse of the statutory period of limitation. Hence no suit for redemption was maintainable.<br/><br/>7. In order to enable us to decide the ques­tion as to the application of section 26G of the Bengal Tenancy Act, the learned Counsel for the appellant cited a few decisions. Section 26G reads as follows: <br/>"<strong>26G.</strong> (1) An occupancy-raiyati may enter into a complete usufructuary mort­gage in respect of his holding or of a por­tion or share thereof for any period which does not and cannot, in any possible, event, by any agreement, express or im­plied, exceed fifteen years land notwith­standing anything contained in this Act or in any other law or in any contract, no other form of usufructuary mortgage so entered into after the commencement of the Bengal Tenancy (Amendment) Act, 1928, shall have any force or effect." <br/><br/>8. Facts of the cases cited by the learned Counsel for the appellant did, however, arise before the amendment of section 26G allowing transfer of occupancy holding. In <strong><em>Sarat Kumar Banerjee v. Munshi Abdul Bari, (1931-32) 36 CWN 844</em></strong>, it was held that "where the tenant of a non-transferable occupancy hold­ing gave a usufructuary mortgage thereof to a third person and subsequently, default, having been made in the payment of rent, the land­lord obtained a decree and putting up the holding to sale purchased it himself, the usu­fructuary mortgage by the tenant coupled with the subsequent rent-sale constituted an aban­donment by the tenant which gave the landlord a right to re-enter"<br/><br/>9. In <strong><em>Krishna</em></strong><strong><em> Chandra Datta Chowdhury vs. Khiran Bajania, (1905-6) 10, CWN 499,</em></strong> it was held that "by creating an usufructuary mortgage, an occupancy raiyat not authorised to transfer his holding makes himself liable to ejectment by the landlord."<br/><br/>10. In <strong><em>Ram Prashad Koeri vs Jawahir Roy, (1907-8) 12 CWN 899</em></strong>, it has been held that "when an occupancy raiyat mortgages his (non-transferable) holding and the mort­gagee enforces the mortgage, has the holding sold, and purchases it himself, the possession of the raiyat completely ceases and there is an abandonment of the holding by him".<br/><br/>11. In <strong><em>Jogendra Chandra Das vs. Debendra Nath Ghose, (1934-35) 39 CWN 428</em></strong>, it has been held that "between a landlord purchaser of a non-transferable occupancy holding at a rent sale and a third party purchaser, there is no distinction in respect of the duty to annul an existing encumbrance on the holding. Both have to annul the encumbrance before they can obtain khas possession from the holder of the encumbrance or any one holding under him, the reason being that in cases of transfers of an entire holding which are not by way of sale (e.g. as in this case, a usufructuary 'mortgage of the entire holding) the right of a landlord, as such, are the same as in cases of sale of a part of the holding, namely, he is not entitled to recover possession."<br/><br/>12. Whatever relevancy these cases might have in respect of the instant case before us, it must be seen to have been lost in view of the amendment of the section in 1928 which made an occupancy holding transferable. It, there­fore, follows that the usufructuary mortgage of the suit land by Abdus Samad is not hit by section 26G as now stands amended and the right of redemption continued even after the auction purchase of the suit land by Purna Chandra Sarkar on 14-12-33 which passed along with the transfer of the suit land to the plaintiff-respondent. The right of redemption could, therefore, be validly claimed by the plaintiff-respondent.<br/><br/>For reasons, stated above, the appeal is dismissed with costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
