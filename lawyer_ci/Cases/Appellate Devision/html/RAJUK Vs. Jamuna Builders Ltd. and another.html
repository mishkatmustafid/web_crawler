The facts, in short, are, that the respondents as writ petitioners moved the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution challenging the legality of Memo No.SEL/eAA/2cP-85/2002/599Oqix dated 17-11-2002 (Annexure A to the writ petition) and for directing the writ respondents to give sanction to the proposed plan of their project stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the respondent No. 1 is a private limited company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1994 with its objects, <em>inter alia</em>, to construct commercial and residential buildings, engaging in the real estate business and that the company finalised the infra­structure of a project for developing a shopping complex named "Jamuna Future Park" and that in order to make the construction the approval/sanction of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (in short RAJUK) is required under the provision of the Building Construc­tion Act, 1952 and that the writ petitioners sub­mitted plan for approval on 12-9-2001 but the writ respondents failed to accord approval. Rather they issued aforesaid memo dated 17-11-2002 directing the writ petitioners to dis­mantle the structures of the writ petitioners from the land in question. Under such circum­stances the writ petitioners felt constrained to file the writ petition.<br/><br/>3. The writ respondents contested the Rule filing affidavit-in-opposition denying the material allegations made in the writ petition contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that notice was served upon the writ petitioner company requesting to submit RAJUK approved plan but to no effect and that a report was published in the Daily Janakantha dated 10-8-2002 regarding unauthorised construction of the Jamuna Future Park, the project of the writ petitioners, and the writ petitioners did not produce any document nor give any explanation for nonfiling of the approved plan and, as such, the writ petitioner No.2 being the Managing Director of the writ petitioner No.1 company was served with another notice dated 12-8-2002 (Annexure IB to the writ petition) to which the writ petitioner No.2 gave a reply on 13-8-2002 from which it could not be considered whether the writ petitioner started construction with any prior approval of RAJUK and, as such, the writ petitioner was asked to stop construction and dismantle the unauthorised construction under the provision of the Building Construction Act, 1952.<br/><br/>4. After hearing the parties, the High Court Division by the impugned judgment and order made the Rule absolute directing the writ respondents to sanction and/or approve the plan on receiving 10 times fee of the amount prescribed.<br/><br/>5. Hence is this petition.<br/><br/>6. In support of the petition, Ms. Sigma Huda, learned Advocate for the petitioners, submits, <em>inter  alia</em>, that the High Court Division committed error in the decision in failing to consider that construction without obtaining sanction according to the provision of section 3 of the Building Construction Act, 1952 is unauthorised and, as such, the writ petitioners are bound to dismantle the unauthorised  construction and that there being violation of sub-rule (5) of Rule 7 of the Building Construction Rules,  1996 the writ petitioners ought not to have been given the relief sought for by them.<br/><br/>7. Mr. Rafique-ul Haque with Mr. Moudud Ahmed, learned Senior Counsels appearing for the respondents, opposed the petition.<br/><br/>8. We have considered the submissions and perused the materials on record. It is not denied that the writ petitioners filed applica­tion on 12-9-2001 before RAJUK for according approval for construction of their project. But, at least till 17-11-2002, the date of issuance of the impugned notice (Annexure-A to the writ petition) their plan was not approved nor it was refused.<br/><br/>9. In this connection, we have perused the provision of section 3B of the Building Construction Act, 1952 wherefrom it is clear that before issuance of the impugned notice dated 17-11-2002 the writ respondents ought to have issued prior show cause notice as required under section 3B(1)(b) of the Act.<br/><br/>10. The High Court Division after hearing the parties and on perusal of the materials produced by them observed:<br/>“It appears from the papers annexed to the writ petition and the affidavit-in-opposition that no such show cause notice as contemplated under section 3B (1) (b) of the Building Construction Act was ever served upon the petitioner asking him to explain within 7 days as to why the pro­posed construction of the building should not be dismantled or removed nor the petitioner had been given any opportunity of being heard. The respondents however, issued a notice dated 12-8-2002, Annexure-1(b) by which the respondent asked the petitioner to stop the construction work and further directed to remove the construction within 7 days and further warned the petitioner to the effect that since the construction is unauthorised proper action will be taken for removing the unauthorised construction under section (sic) of the Act. To what extent the construction was raised or made till then that was not ascertained. The petitioner replied to the notice dated 12-8-2002 by their letter dated 13-8-2002 [Annexure-1(c) to the affidavit-in-opposition] where it was stated that the petitioner submitted the plan on 12-9-2001 for commercial-cum-residential complex with the papers and also the clearance obtained from the RAJUK and since the approval was with­held at the instance of the Ministry of Works the petitioner was compelled to start the construction work with the information to the Authorised Officer of RAJUK. Admittedly, after submission of the plan, the petitioners have constructed the complex to certain extent till the notice dated 12-8-2002 served by RAJUK upon the petitioners and what action was taken subsequently with regard to the approval to the plan had not been communicated to the petitioner.”<br/><br/>11. The High Court Division after consi­dering the provision of sub-section 5 of section 3B found that the sanction if prayed for could be granted for the construction of the building if the petitioner complies with the provision of sub-section (5)(d)(i) and (iii) thereof of the Act. Considering the offer of the writ petitioners to pay maximum fine i.e. 10 times of the fees for sanction of the plan as per rules, the High Court Division passed the impugned order directing to give sanction/approval to the plan which has remained pending/unattended by RAJUK for a long time but directed payment of 10 times of the fees for the sanction.<br/><br/>12. The High Court Division appears to have considered the facts and circumstances and the provision of law elaborately and thus have given the direction.<br/><br/>13. We have perused the judgment and order. In view of what has been stated it appears to us that the High Court Division committed no error in the decision. Moreso, in the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division it has also been mentioned that the writ respondents i.e. present petitioners, may verify the plan in the context of the Building Construction Rules, 1996 at the time of giving approval.  On the face of it the impugned order on this score also appears to deserve no interference.<br/><br/>We, therefore, do not find any substance in the petition. In view of the discussion made above, the petition stands dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
