Appellant who is the plaintiff instituted Title Suit No. 62 of 1973 for declaration of his right, title and interest in the suit property as well as the cinema shall along with its struc­tures and business. Averments made in the plaint are as follows:<br/>(a) The appellant with proforma-respondents 3 and 4 started a firm at Chuadanga in the name of Mahabir Cinema Company, each having one-third share, mainly to deal in showing of films and cinematograph;<br/>(b) With the above purpose the firm acquired landed properties described in the schedule of the plaint for starting a cinema hall which was proposed to be named "Rupchhaya Cinema Hall" which was to be an associated firm of Mahabir Cinema Company. The landed pro­perties were acquired in the name of Hajarilal, Manager of Mahabir Cinema Company, and Jatindra Lai Biswas, an employee of Mahabir Cinema Company.<br/>(c) The cinema hall was constructed with the money of the appellant and respondents 3 and 4 and respondent 1 was taken in as working partner of Rupchhaya Cinema Hall and respondent 1 had no share in Mahabir Cinema Com­pany or its properties.<br/>(d) Taking advantage of temporary absence of the appellant, respondent 1 managed to create some false, forged and fabricated documents to deprive the appellant of his rights in suit properties and to usurp the same. Respondent 1 has only four annas share in the business of Rupchhaya Cinema Hall and has no interest in the suit properties.<br/>(e) Appellant never sold his interest to anyone. By creating false documents respondent 1 in collusion with local in­fluential persons is trying to dispossess the appellant and is not furnishing any accounts of the cinema business and of the income of other proper lies of Mahabir Cinema Company to the appe­llant since 28-8-73, and the appellant, therefore, filed the suit on 14-9-73. <br/>He prayed, among others, for the following relief: <br/>"(a) That the plaintiff's 4 annas title in the lands and structure as described below and in the cinema business be declared and the defendant be directed to furnish upto-date account of the cinema business since 28-8-1973."  <br/><br/>3. Respondents No. 1 and predecessor of respondent No. 2 denied the material allega­tions in the plaint, it was asserted by them that whatever interest the appellant had in the partnership business was transferred by him to respondent Nos. 1 on 2 October 1961. Thereafter respondent No. 1 entered into new partnership with the predecessor of respondent No 2. Though the partnership was not registered, no specific objection was raised in the written statement that the suit was not maintainable in view of the provisions of sec­tion 69 of the Partnership Act. Such objec­tion, when taken by respondent No. 1 after the evidence was closed and in course of the argument, was over-ruled by the trial Court. Findings of the trial Court were that the suit properties were acquired by the appellant and respondent Nos. 3 and 4 for the Mahabir Cinema Company of which they were partners; respondent No. 1 interpolated the deed of partnership dated 26-4-82 in order to prove his claim; respondent No. 1 created false document and the appellant did not transfer his interest in the firm in favour of respondent No. 1; and the appellant had existing interest in the suit properties including the Cinama hall and Cinama business. In First Appeal No. 6 of 1980 respondent Nos. 1 and 2 while challenging the finding in the trial court's judgment raised the bar of section 69 of the Partnership Act.<br/><br/>4. In order to over-come the bar of sec­tion 69 of the Partnership Act the appellant filed an application for amendment of the plaint by way of substituting the abovementioned relief quoted earlier in the judgment by the relief as follows: <br/>"(a) A decree for dissolution of part­nership firm "Mahabir Cinema Company" and "Rupchhaya Cinema Hall" be passed upon declaration of the plaintiff's one-fourth share in the said partnership firms and defendant No. 1 be directed to fur­nish upto-date account of the cinema business since 28-8-1973." <br/><br/>5. In the petition for amendment it was stated that the amendment was necessary to avoid multiplicity of proceedings, hardship of the parties and for complete adjudication of the dispute and determination of the real question in controversy. It was mentioned further that no new facts were being intro­duced but mere amendment of relief was be­ing prayed for which was solely directed to remove the objection regarding the maintaina­bility of the suit and that defendant-respon­dents would not in any way be prejudiced.<br/><br/>6. By their judgment dated 15-3-83 the learned Judges of the High Court Division rejected the application for amendment of the plaint, allowed the appeal and set  aside the judgment and decree of the trial Court. It was held that the partnership being not a registered one, the suit as framed was barred under section 69 of the Partnership Act.<br/><br/>7. Grounds for refusal to allow amend­ment were that the proposed amendment changed the nature and character of the suit requiring the framing of fresh issue and per­mission to produce evidence by both parties to the suit so as to enable the Court to decide whether the requirements of law as laid down in section 44 of the Partnership Act for dis­solution partnership were fulfilled or not.<br/><br/>8. Leave to appeal was granted by this Court on the contention of the plaintiff-appellant that the proposed amendment of the plaint for dissolution of partnership was con­sidered necessary by him for removing the objection as to maintainability of the suit which was initially for a declaration of the share and accounts and the nature and charac­ter of the suit would not be changed, and that the High Court Division was not correct in rejecting the application for amendment Further, it was contended that the proper and indeed the only remedy available to partner in an unregistered firm or whose name does not  appear on the Register of the Firms, to enforce his rights against the firm or any partner of the firm is by bringing a suit for the dissolution of the firm. Order 6, Rule 17, C.P.C. was relied upon in support of the contention. And   further, insofar as the amendment was merely in respect of relief sought, the question of changing the nature and character of the suit did not arise.<br/><br/>9. Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed, Counsel for the appellants, referred 10 principles enunciated in the following decisions as to when amendmend of the plaint may be allowed and asserted that having regard to those principles it could not be held that the proposed amendment of the plaint in the present suit was not covered by them. The learned Counsel submitted that since no new fact were introduced in the plaint excepting amend­ment of the prayer portion therein which would neither change the nature and character of the suit nor prejudice the defendant-res­pondents the amendment should have been allowed. Further, there was no point taken over the proposed amendment but on the ground that it was sought for the purpose of circum­venting the bar imposed by the provisions of section 69 of the Partnership Act. It was further pointed out by him that the pro­posed amendment praying for dissolution of the partnership firm was not in conflict with the prayer for declaration of the appellants' ¼th share in the firm. For, even when an order for dissolution is required to be made in a suit for dissolution, the declaration of partner's share therein and taking of ac­counts map be necessary, depending on the facts and circumstances of each case. He also mentioned that the findings arrived at by the trial court regarding the title and circumstances showing the respondents' con­duct by way of attempting to deprive the appellant of his share in the firm would show that dissolution was the only con­sequence arising therefrom.<br/><br/>10. In view of the submissions made by the learned Counsel for the appellants, it is necessary to consider the decisions cited by him in their support. As to when an amendment of the plaint may be allowed by the Court one of the earliest pronouncements was made in the case of <strong><em>Kasinath Das Vs. Sadasiv Patnaik, (1893) ILR 20 Cal. 805</em></strong> which is as follows: <br/>"an amendment, so long as it does not alter the character of the suit, may be allowed at any time before judgment. The restriction is only as to the nature of the suit; the law prohibits any such amendment as would charge the fundamental character of the suit; for exam­ple, a plaint cannot be so amended as convert a claim based on contract into an action on tort. But an alteration in the relief does not alter the character of a suit." <br/><br/>11. As regards when the Court will exercise the discretion conferred upon it by the provisions of the Order 6, Rule 17, C.P.C. the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council bad the occasion to consider the limits on the Court's powers to amend the case of <strong><em>Ma Shwe Mya Vs. Maung Mo Hnaung, AIR 922 PC 249</em></strong> corresponding to <strong><em>ILR 48 Cal. 832. </em></strong><br/>The relevant passage is as follows: <br/>"All rules of Court are nothing but provisions intended to secure the proper administration of justice, and it is therefore essential that they should be made to serve and be subordinate to that purpose, so that full powers of amendment must be enjoyed and should always be liberally exercised, but none­theless no power has yet been given to enable one distinct cause of action to be substituted for another, nor to change by means of amendment the subject matter of the suit." <br/><br/>12. The next case in which the extent of the Court's power to allow an amendment of the plaint was considered is the case <strong><em>E.K.S Chettyar Firm Vs. Maung Min Maung, AIR 1933 Rangoon 47.</em></strong> The learned Judge who delivered the judgment their in referred to the aforesaid cases and the observations quoted above and observed as follows: <br/>"the one thing which must not be altered by an amendment is the funda­mental character of the suit; and I understand that the fundamental cha­racter of a suit must refer to the foun­dation on which a suit is based and not the prayer in the plaint that deter­mines its fundamental character." <br/><br/>13. In the case of <strong><em>Golam Hafez Mia, Vs. Khadem Ali Meah (1977) 29 DLR SC 311</em></strong>, this Court while considering whether the High Court Division was justified in refusing the plaintiff appellant's prayer for amendment of the plaint placed reliance on <strong><em>Keramat Ali Vs. Muhammad Yunus, 15 DLR SC 20</em></strong> and observed: <br/>"It is the consistent view of judicial authorities that amendments of the pleadings are allowed, even when a legal right had accrued to the ether party, if special circumstances of the case out­weigh such consideration. In exercising this power, the Court would no doubt, be reluctant to allow such an amend­ment, which would have the effect of totally altering nature of the suit, or take sway a valuable right accrued by lapse of time, but where in the circums­tances of the particular case, it would be plainly inequitable to refuse such a relief, the court will not hesitate to act." <br/><br/>14. These views were reiterated by this Court in <strong><em>Mrs. Nurun Nahar Vs. Mohd. Fazlur Rahman, 1979 BSCR 135</em></strong>. In addition, while referring to the provisions of Order 6, Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure it was observed that "the Code has not set up any bar of limitation in allowing amendment of the pleadings. Nonetheless, it is now well set­tled that the question of delay is always con­sidered as an important consideration in allowing or refusing amendment of the plea­dings".<br/><br/>15. Mr. S. R. Pal, Counsel for the res­pondents, contended that the relief originally claimed by the appellant related to his claim of title in the partnership firm, but with the prayer made in the proposed amendment there would be change of relief. The proposed amendment would accordingly bring in the question of determining the existence or non-existence of the circumstances justifying the latter claim for the dissolution of the part­nership firm. Fresh issues would require to be framed and this would lead to taking fur­ther evidence to see whether a case under section 44 of the Partnership Act was made out. According to him, therefore, the grant­ing of the prayer for amendment of the plaint would change the nature and character of the suit. Thus the suit for declaration of title would be changed into a suit for dissolu­tion of partnership firm. Secondly, Mr. Pal, referred to the provisions of sec­tion 69 of the Partnership Act which im­pose the bar against such suit. Thirdly, the appellant will not in any way be prejudiced if the proposed amendment was not allowed, and he could bring in a suit for dissolution even after the suit for declaration of his share and for taking accounts was disposed of. Mr. Pal relied on two decisions, namely, <strong><em>Keramat Ali Vs. Muhammad Yunus Haji (1963) 15 DLR 120 SC</em></strong> and <strong><em>Golam Hafez Mia Vs. Khadem Ali Meah, (1977) 29 DLR 3J1 SC</em></strong>.<br/><br/>16. In the first of the above cases ment­ioned by Mr. Pal, namely, <strong><em>Keramat Ali Vs. Muhammad Yunus Haji</em></strong> it was observed by <strong>Hammoodur Rahman, J.</strong>, that "in exercising this power, on doubt, this Court would be relu­ctant to allow an amendment which would have the effect of totally altering the nature of the suit or of taking away a valuable right accrued by lapse of time, but where in the circumstances of a particular case it would be plainly inequitable to refuse such a relief this Court will not hesitate to do what the Judicial Committee did, in the case of <strong><em>Md. Zahoor Ali Khan Vs. Mst. Thakooranee Rutta Koer, 11 MIA 468. </em></strong><br/><br/>17. Quite rightly, whether the Court will allow amendment to the plaint or refuse to do so would depend upon the question whether the nature of the suit would be altered thereby. But when case is otherwise, such amendment would not be refused. The lea­rned Judge himself while referring to the obser­vations of the Judicial Committee said that "the Court had undoubtedly full power to allow such amendment even where a legal right had accrued by lapse of time if the spe­cial circumstances of the case out weigh such consideration". This case was con­sidered by us in the two cases mentioned above and was also relied upon by Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed, Counsel for the appellant, in support of his client's prayer for allowing amendment of the plaint.<br/><br/>18. As regards the second case relied upon by Mr. Pal. nothing new has been said therein excepting what has been observed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and the Supreme Court of Pakistan in respect of the amendment of the pleadings. Besides, this case has already been considered by us above and we did no find anything therein which is against allowing the prayer for amendment as made by the appellant in the present case.<br/><br/>19. The main controversy which has cropped up on the question of whether the proposed amendment would be allowed or not seems to be with regard to the interpre­tation of section 69 of the Partnership Act. Apparently, the proposed amendment of the plaint was necessary for avoiding multiplicity of proceedings and complete adjudication of the dispute between the parties on determina­tion of real question in controversy. Since no new relieves appear to have been prayed for in  the proposed amendment excepting the termination of the relationship of partners between the appellant and the respondents on declaration of the appellants share and taking of upto date accounts since the acqui­sition of the aforesaid share by the appellant, it is necessary to  examine  whether there is really any legal impediment against the prayer for dissolution of a partnership firm with a prayer for declaration for a partner's share therein and taking accounts. Provisions of section 69 which the respondents' Counsel referred to as offering such impediment may now, therefore, be considered. Section 69 of the Partnership Act runs as follows:<br/>"<strong>69. Effect of Non-registration.-</strong> (1) No suit to enforce a right arising from a contract or conferred by this Act shall be instituted in any Court by or on behalf of any person suing as a partner in a firm against the firm or any person alleged to be or to have been a partner in the firm unless the firm is registered and the person suing is or has been shown in the Register of Firms as a partner in the firm.<br/>(2) No suit to enforce a right arising from a contract shall be instituted in any Court by or on behalf a firm-against any third party unless the firm is registered and the persons suing are or have been shown in the Register of Firms as partners in the firm,<br/>(3) The provisions of sub-sections (1) and (2) shall apply also to a claim of set-off or other proceeding to enforce a right arising from a contract, but shall not affect—<br/>(a) the enforcement of any right to sue for dissolution of a firm or for accounts of a dissolved firm, or any right or power to realize the property of a dissolved firm, or<br/>(b) the powers of an official assignee, rece­iver or Court under the Insolvency (D) Act, 1909 or the Insolvency Act, 1920, realize the property of an insolvent partner." <br/><br/>20. There is no controversy that the partnership firm in the present case is a registered one. It would, therefore, follow that in view of the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 69 the suit would <em>prima facie</em> appear to be barred thereunder. But procee­ding to the provisions of sub-section (3) of section 69 such a suit does not seem to be affected by the bar imposed by sub-section (1) so as not be maintainable. The provisions of the said sub-section lay down the rule that sub-sections (1) and (2) "shall not affect (a) the enforcement of any right to sue for the dissolution of the firm or for accounts of a dissolved firm, or any right or power to realize the property of a dissolved firm". Appellant's suit was originally for declaration of the shares and accounts. By amending the prayer he now also seeks dissolu­tion of the firm. It is difficult to understand why the prayer for dissolution cannot pro­ceed in combination with the original prayer in the plaint. Neither logic nor the reality inherent in the situation can be advanced as a ground against combination of such prayers in a single suit. If a partner of an unregistered firm can maintain a suit for dissolution and account, his prayer for decla­ration of his share may as well be tried prior to dissolving the firm. Taking accounts of the firm is also a concomitant of the relief claimed by him for dissolution of the firm. Whatever bar was imposed by the provisions of sub-section (1) and (2) cannot stand in, the way of combining the prayers as made by the appellant in his petition for amend­ment. This will find support from the case of <strong><em>Abdul Rezzak Vs Nashiruddin Ahmed, (1958-59; 63 CWN 766.</em></strong> The Court, while concurring with the views of different High Courts expressed in a series of cases, observed as follows: <br/>"A suit for dissolution is obviously a comprehensive suit and the prayer for dissolution in such a suit is a com­pendious prayer, including within it, <em>inter alia</em>, also a prayer for accounts. That is clear from the nature of a suit for dissolution of a firm and also from the provisions of Order XX, rule 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure which pro­vides for a particular type of decree or the particular relieves which may be given or ought to be given by the Court in such a suit. Clearly, also, a suit for dissolution and accounts is, in substance a combination of two suits or a com­bination of two relieves, one after the other and the question of the relief as to accounts really arises after the dis­solution of that firm. Strictly speaking, therefore, the prayer for accounts in such a suit follows only on the disso­lution of the firm by the decree of the Court and it is, therefore, in effect, a prayer for accounts of a dissolved firm and so comes also within the second part of clause (a) of sub-section (3) of sec. 69. The only effect again, of taking the other view, limiting the saving provision in the first part of clause (a) to a suit for dissolution of a firm with­out a prayer for accounts, would be to drive the plaintiff in such a suit to a second suit for accounts. That will be encouraging and leading to multiplicity of proceedings which should be avoided, whenever possible." <br/><br/>In view of the facts and circumstances of the case the appeal is allowed. The suit is remanded to the trial court which may, upon taking such fresh evidence as may be neces­sary dispose of the suit on the amended plaint. There will be no order as to costs.<br/>Ed. .</div></div></div>
