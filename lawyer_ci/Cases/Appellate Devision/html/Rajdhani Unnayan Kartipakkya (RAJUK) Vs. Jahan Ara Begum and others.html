Nos. 73 and 74 of 2002 have been filed against the common judgment dated July 31, 2001 in Writ Petition Nos. 3407 and 4576 of 1996.<br/><br/>2. Facts of the petitions and the question of law involved being common the same have been taken up for hearing together. The writ petitions in the first bunch were filed impugning the notice of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartipakky (RAJUK) pub­lished in the 'Daily Ittafaq' on September 7, 1994 inviting application from the persons who were affected because of the acquisition of their land by the L.A. Case Nos. 138 of 1961-62, 91 of 1957-58 and 26 of 1959-60. The writ petitions as mentioned in the second bunch were filed impugning the notice issued by the Magistrate of the RAJUK, Dhaka, asking the persons to vacate the land in unauthorized occupa­tion and to remove the structures there­on by the 24th August, 1996.<br/><br/>3. Facts in all the appeals are more or less same. It was the case of the writ-petitioners that proceeding for the acquisition of the land was initiated and part of the compensation money was paid but later on Government decided to de-requisition their land along with the land of others and thereupon they were served with the notice to return the com­pensation money  received  earlier by them and accordingly they refunded the compensation money to the Deputy Commissioner but in spite of that the deputy commissioner did not complete the process of de-requisition. It was the case of the writ petitioners that they are in possession of the land and that they have exclusive right, title, interest and possession in the land in suit.<br/><br/>4. The Rule was opposed by the RAJUK. It was the case of the RAJUK that the land of the writ-petitioners along with other land was requisitioned in different L.A. cases for development of residential are and in due course com­pensation was paid to the owners of the land and the Deputy Commissioner delivered possession of the land to the DIT, now RAJUK in April, 1963. The Board of trustee of erstwhile DIT in its meeting held on July 27, 1965 decided to revise its scheme but never aban­doned the scheme. It was also the case of the RAJUK that Government after re-examining the scheme and considering the housing problem in the Dhaka city directed the DIT (now RAJUK) not to release any land already requisitioned and the Deputy Commissioner was directed not to accept any return of money from the awardees. It was also the case of the RAJUK that possession of the land as now claimed by the writ-petitioners was taken over on payment of substantial portion of the compensation money and that on taking over pos­session RAJUK proceeded with the development of the area. It was contend­ed on behalf of the RAJUK that since the writ-petitions being the persons said to have acquired interest subsequent to requisition they as such are not compe­tent to question legality of the proceed­ing of the requisition since their vendors or they have received compensation, that notice under Section 94A(1) of the Town Improvement Act, 1953 was served by the Deputy Commissioner upon the owners of the land requisi­tioned and as against the said notice nei­ther the owners nor the writ-petitioners raised any objection, that at no point of time any order was passed by the Government for de-requisition of the land under the Town Improvement Act.<br/><br/>5. It may be mentioned in some of the writ-petitions it was contended that the writ petitioners never received any com­pensation in respect of their land. As seen from the writ petitions of this cate­gory that the writ-petitioners have acquired their interest in the land subse­quent to the initiation of the L.A. case for the requisition of the land as now they are claiming.<br/><br/>6. At the time of hearing it was contended on behalf of the writ-petitioners that Government took decision to de-requisi­tion 1005 acres of land out of 2076 acres of land and thereupon issued notice to the writ-petitioners and in some cases to their predecessors-in-interest asking for refund of the compensation money ear­lier received by the persons whose land was requisitioned and that the petition­ers remained in possession of their respective land. It was also contended that some of the writ-petitioners were not paid any compensation in respect of the land so requisitioned. It was further contended that it was the legitimate expectation of the writ-petitioners that as their land would no longer be required by the requiring body they would be allowed to remain in posses­sion of their land or in the alternative they would be provided with alternative plot or that the would get compensation in respect of their land as per provision of the Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance, 1982. It was submitted on behalf of the writ-petitioner in refuting the question of non-maintainability of the writ petition that the writ-petitioners were not chal­lenging the acquisition proceeding but they have come before the Court to establish their claim of being entitled to be treated equally and in accordance with law in the matter of either by allot­ting to them alternative plots or by giv­ing them compensation as per the pres­ent market value and till then their pos­session in the land in question should not be disturbed.<br/><br/>7. On behalf of the RAJUK it was con­tended that L.A. Cases were duly initiat­ed after issuance of notice upon the owners of the land in question and that the land in question having been requisi­tioned upon initiation of the L.A. cases the same vested to the Government under Section 93A of the Town Improvement Act and hat their is no pro­vision for releasing the land so vested in the Government or in other words so requisitioned and that after requisition the land owners are only entitle to get compensation.<br/><br/>8. The High Court Division disposed of the writ petitions with the following observations and the directions:<br/>"We have heard learned lawyers of both the sides and considering the facts and circumstances of the case what we find is that the petitioners are not challenging the Acquisition proceeding but their grievance is that they are in possession of the lands in question, some of the petitioners also refunded the compensa­tion money received from the acquiring authority. In this regard we find sub­stance in the contention of Mr. Farid Ahmed the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioners that they had their legitimate expectation that they will be given alternative plots or will be given sufficient compensation as per provision of ordinance 1982.<br/><br/>9. Having regard to the facts and cir­cumstances of the case we find that the acquisition proceedings have not yet been completed and the petitioners are very much in possession of the lands in question.  We therefore hold that the petitioners are entitled to be equally treated and in accordance with law. In such view of the matter, we hold the petitioners must either be given and alternative plots or will be given suffi­cient compensation as per provision of Ordinance, 1982. We therefore direct that RAJUK to take all possible steps to complete the proceedings of the L.A. case in question preferably within 6 months from the date of receipt of this order.<br/><br/>10. The Respondents are also directed to prove   their title and ownership   in respect of the lands in question if the respondents by this time were given part compensation money they will get the balance amount of compensation as per provision of the said Ordinance or they may be given alternative plot if on com­pensation was given. In the meantime the acquiring authority shall finalise the L.A. case and till then the petitioners, shall not be disturbed of their peaceful possession in any manner".<br/><br/>11.  Leave was granted to consider the submission of  the learned Counsel appearing for the appellants in all the appeals that "the High Court Division erred in law in holding/directing that the writ petitioners be given compensation according to the present market value as provided in the Ordinance, 1982 and that the writ-petitioners will get balance amount of compensation as per provi­sion of the said Ordinance inasmuch as the requisition and acquisition was initi­ated and carried out under Section 93A of the Town Improvement Act, 1953 and that after repeal of the said provision the pending proceeding would continue in pursuance of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act and Section 73 (Uma) and 74(2) of the Town Improvement (Amendment) Act XXIX of 1987 and as such the provisions of Ordinance No. II of 1982 have no manner of application in the matter of assessment/payment of compensation. He further submits that the High Court Division erred in law in holding that the writ-petitioners may be given alternative plot if no compensa­tion was given inasmuch as the issue of alternative plot is not germane/related to requisition/acquisition of land under the Town Improvement Act, 1953 nor alter­native plot is linked with compensation nor the writ-petitioners have any funda­mental or legal right to allotment of plot as a necessary corollary to requisition of land and as such the direction of the High Court Division is beyond the scope of jurisdiction of the High Court Division under Article 102(2) (a) (i) of the Constitution of Bangladesh. He also submits that the High Court Division committed illegality in upholding the argument that the writ-petitioners had their legitimate expectation that they would be given alternative plot because the issue of alternative plot has no direct nexus and is not a necessary corollary to acquisition of land of the petitioner under the provisions of the Town Improvement Act, 1953 and further that the allotment of land is a distinct policy and procedure under distinct allotment rules having distinct specific criteria for such allotment which is not automatic with acquisition of land and that there is no legitimate expectation where there is element of chance and fulfillment of cri­teria as per process of evaluation. He also submits that the High Court Division committed illegality in enter­taining the writ petitioners' claim of title in the acquired property on the basis of transactions subsequent to the requisition process because the original owner/awardee, after requisition had no saleable/transferable title in the property and the writ petitioners had no legal right to make any grievance under Article 102(2) (a) (i) of the Constitution before the High Court Division. The learned Counsel further submits that the High Court Division committed illegali­ty in reopening the factual and procedur­al aspects of L.A. case No. 138 of 1961-62 inasmuch as those issues had been finally settled by the High Court Division in the case reported in <strong><em>46 DLR</em></strong> at page 205 and the said judgment had been affirmed by the Appellate Division, Supreme Court of Bangladesh in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos.117-119 of 1994, there was no scope to reagitate those issues. He fur­ther submits that the High Court Division in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 102(2)(a)(i) of the Constitution of Bangladesh traveled beyond the Rule Nisi in granting relief which is neither germane nor have any nexus with impugned public notice pub­lished in daily newspapers inviting application for allotment of land to per­son affected by the acquisition. The learned Counsel lastly submits that the High Court Division committed illegali­ty in failing to hold that the writ peti­tions as framed challenging a public notice published in national dailies were not maintainable under Article 102(2) (a) (i) of the Constitution (Mandamus) inasmuch as writ-petitioners have no fundamental or legal right in non-publi­cation of the public notice nor there is any corresponding statutory obligation upon the appellant (RAJUK-Respondent in writ petition) not to publish such public notice and that the said issue of non maintainability has been affirmatively held by the High Court Division in the judgment passed in the Writ Petition No. 4890 of 1996 dated 01/03/2001 by another Division Bench of the High Court Division."<br/><br/>12. Mr. T.H Khan, learned Counsel, appearing for the appellant submitted that the writ-petitioners be given com­pensation according to the present mar­ket value as provided in the Ordinance, 1982 and that the writ-petitioners will get balance amount of the compensation as per provision of the said Ordinance inasmuch as the requisition and acquisi­tion was initiated and carried out Section 93A of the Town Improvement Act, 1953 and that after repeal of the said provision the pending proceeding would continue in pursuance of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act and Section 73(Uma) and 74(2) of the Town Improvement (Amendment) Act, XXIX of 1987 and as such, the provisions of Ordinance No. II of 1982 have no man­ner of application in the matter of assessment/payment of compensation; that the writ-petitioners may be given alternative plot if no compensation was given inasmuch as the issue of alterna­tive plot is not germane/related to requi­sition/acquisition of land under the Town Improvement Act, 1953 nor alter­native plot is linked with compensation nor the writ petitioner has any funda­mental or legal right to allot of plot as a necessary corollary of requisition of land as such, the High Court Division is beyond the scope of jurisdiction under Article 102(2)(a)(i) of the constitution of Bangladesh; that the writ-petitioners  had their legitimate expectation that they would be given alternative plot because the issue of alternative plot has not direct nexus and is not a necessary corollary to acquisition of land of the petitioner under the provisions of Town Improvement Act, 1953 and further that the allotment of land is a direct policy and procedure under distinct specific criteria for such allotment which is not automatic with acquisition of land and that there is no legitimate expectation where there is element of chance and fulfillment of criteria as per process of evaluation; that the High Court Division committed illegality in entertaining the writ petitioner's claim of title in the acquired property on the basis of trans­actions subsequent to the requisition process because the original owner/awardee, after requisition had no saleable/transferable title in the property and the writ petitioners had no legal right to make any grievance under Article 102(2)(a)(i) of the Constitution; that the High Court Division committed illegality in reopening the factual and procedural aspects of L.A. Case No.138 of 1961-62 inasmuch as those issues had been finally settled by the High Court Division in the case reported in <strong><em>46 DLR 205</em></strong> and the said judgment had been affirmed by this Division. The learned Advocate further submitted that the writ-petition as framed challenging a public notice published in national dailies was not maintainable under Article 102(2) (b) (i) of the Constitution inasmuch as writ petitioner has no fun­damental or legal right in non-publica­tion of the public notice nor there is any corresponding statutory obligation upon the appellant not to publish notice and that the said notice of non-maintainabil­ity has been affirmatively held by the High Court Division; that if the compen­sation is not paid in full the balance of amount to be paid at the rate of present market value inasmuch as the compen­sation has already been paid to the actu­al owners and the same was paid as per relevant law/rule existing at the relevant time.<br/><br/>13. Under the Supreme Court (Appellate Division) Rules a party who has not filed any concise statement though is debarred from arguing for defendant-respondent but upon permission to argue on behalf of the respondent sought by the learned Counsel for the purpose, we have heard Dr. M. Zahir for the respon­dent in order to secure end of justice.<br/><br/>14. Dr. M. Zahir, learned  Counsel, appearing for respondent while support­ing the impugned judgment and order has, however, submitted that the High Court Division considering the facts and circumstances of the case as represented by the writ-petitioners held that the writ-petitioners are not challenging the acquisition proceeding but alleged to be in their possession of the land-in-question that the writ-petitioners had their legitimate expectation that they will get alternative plot or provided with suffi­cient compensation as per provision of Ordinance, 1982  referring  to  the impugned judgment of the High Court Division. The learned Counsel further submitted that as the writ-petitioner-respondents are very much in posses­sion in the land-in-question they are entitled to be treated equally in accor­dance with law and as such, the writ petitioners are entitled to either an alternative plot or be given sufficient compensation as per provision of Ordinance, 1982.<br/><br/>15. Admittedly, the land-in-question was acquired in L.A. Case No.138 of 1961-62 under the provision of Emergency Requisition of the Property Act, 1948 read with Sub-section (2) of Section 93 of the Town Improvement Act for public purpose that the petitioners though alleged non-receipt of certain amount of compensation for acquisition of land thereby the acquisition is not illegal or without lawful jurisdiction inasmuch as the said provision is not synonymous to Section 12 of  the Acquisition and Requisition Ordinance, 1982 and there is no provision in the Emergency Requisition of Property Act, 1947 for any enhanced compensation due to non-receipt of compensation in time. Since payment or non-receipt of compensation is no ground for challenging the acquisition proceeding, the alleged legitimate expectation of Ex-owner to get compensation as per provision of Ordinance, 1982 is of no avail.<br/><br/>16. That the requisition and acquisition having been completed as per the provision of Emergency Requisition of Property Act, 1948, even if the proceed­ing is pending that would continue thereunder pursuant to the provision of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, XXIX of 1987 and as such, the provi­sions of Ordinance II of 1982 have been illegally applied in the instant case in the matter of assessment/payment of com­pensation of the property acquired under the provision repealed Act.<br/><br/>17.  Upon the given facts in the instant case, the High Court Division has mis­conceived the principle of legitimate expectation of giving an alternative plot which the law under consideration has not provided for.<br/><br/>18. The High Court Division has also misconceived the provisions of law in applying the same in respect of the peti­tioner's case because the respondent's right, title and possession extinguished with the completion of the acquisition proceeding vesting right, title, interest and provision in the land under acquisi­tion to the Authority inasmuch as the ex<em>-</em>owner/ awardee has ceased to have any right, title and possession thereto upon acquisition of land.<br/><br/>19. In view of the above, we find merit in   the submissions of the   learned Counsel for the appellants and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division making the Rule disposed of with directions therein are, hereby, set aside.<br/>Accordingly, the appeals are allowed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
