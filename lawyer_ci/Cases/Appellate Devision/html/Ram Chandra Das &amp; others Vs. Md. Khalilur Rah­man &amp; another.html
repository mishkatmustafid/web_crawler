No. 55 of 1978.)<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Judgment</strong></span></div> <div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fazle Munim CJ.— </strong>This appeal arises from First Appeal No. 55 of 1978 passed by the High Court Division on 25 March 1982.<br/><br/>2. Plaintiff who is the respondent instituted Title Suit No.3 of 1976 in the 5th court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka for specific perfor­mance of contract to sell the suit lands. Plaintiff's case was that the defendants entered into an agreement with him on November 2, 1970 to sell the suit land being a tank with banks and adjoining agricultural lands at a consideration of Tk. 28,500/-. Defendants accepted Tk. 6,000/- as earnest money. Stipulations between them were that the plaintiff would offer the balance of the consideration money to the defendants within one month upon which they would execute and register .the sale deed. It was fur­ther agreed that if the plaintiff failed to do so-the earnest money would be forfeited but if the defendants refused to accept the balance amount and failed to execute and register the sale deed within the aforesaid period the plai­ntiff should be entitled to specific performance of the contract through Court. On November 25, 1970 the plaintiff offered the balance con­sideration money but the defendants refused to accept it on the plea of their failure to procure Income tax and gain tax clearance certificates and Nationality certificate but assured the plai­ntiff that they would complete the transaction after obtaining these certificates. Plaintiff made several offers since then but the defendants deferred the matter. Ultimately defendants refused to sell the land on October 7, 1973 unless the plaintiff agreed to pay 15,000/- in additions to the balance consideration money.<br/><br/>3. Defendant Nos.1-3 contested the suit by filing a joint written statement wherein it was contended that the suit was barred by limitation, that the time was the essence of the contract, that defendants agreed to sell the suit land situated at a distant village from the residence to raise money to purchase agricultural lands and also to invest capital in fish business, that they entered into an agreement with one Pagali Mondal for purchasing 2.94 acres of agricultural land, that as the plaintiff failed to pay the balance consideration the defendants could not purchase the said land and earnest money paid by them was forfeited, that defen­dants had no obligation to' obtain income tax clearance certificates etc. which was the responsibility of the plaintiff and that the price of land in the locality had increased in the mean time.<br/><br/>4. By its judgment on December 31, 1977 the trial Court decreed the suit holding <em>inter alia</em> that the suit was not barred by limitation, that the plaintiff tendered the balance consi­deration money to defendants who refused to accept the same and to execute and register the sale deed on the plea that they failed to Obtain the requisite certificates, that the agree to purchase land by defendants from Pagali Mondal was not genuine and that time was not the essence of the contract. Appeal preferred, by the defendants against the judg­ment and decree of the trial court was dis­missed by the High Court Division on 23 March 1982. It was held that in the absence of any contract to the contrary defendants had the responsibility to obtain the required certificates that the plaintiff was ready and willing to pay the balance consideration money, time was not of the essence of the contract as the parties did not intend it to be so and. that specific performance would not cause undue hardships to defendants.<br/><br/>5. Being aggrieved, defendants moved this Court and obtained leave to consider whether the findings of the trial Court as affirmed by the High Court Division that time was not the essence of the contract was justified by the evidence led in the case. Defendants' conten­tions were that one of the reasons for not accepting their case that time was the essence of the contract was that it was the responsibility of the defendants to procure the certificates etc. and since they failed to show that they have been duty procured by them within the stipulated time, it could not be held that time, was made the essence of the contract. Appellants were permitted to add the following grounds:             <br/>"For that in view of plaintiff's own case that "the cause of action for the suit arose at first on 1-12-70 when the stipu­lated period of the agreement for sale expired" (showing time was the essence of the contract) and thereafter lastly on 7-10-73 when the defendants ultimately refused to sell the schedule land to the plaintiff unless he agrees to pay the enhanced amount of Tk. 15,000/- in addition to the balance consideration money the learned Judges of the High Court Division misdirected themselves in not re­fusing specific performance of contract in exercising Court's discretion under Section 22 of the Special Relief Act as there has been a change in the status quo of the matters at the time, the suit was filed on 16-11-73 and the plaintiff is guilty of delay and latches.<br/>For that in the facts and circumstances of the case the claim of specific perfor­mance of the contract for sale ought to have been dismissed as the same would impose great hardship on the defendants who being illiterate and poor could not foresee the same." <br/><br/>6. Mr. M. H. Khondker, Counsel for the defendant-appellants, referred to the terms of the contract Ext. 1, to establish his con­tention that the parties intended that time should be of the essence of the contract. In support of the proposition that where time is made the essence of the contract it must be performed within the 'time stipu­lated in the contract failing which the Court will not grant specific performance of the contract, he cited a few decisions. Before considering the decisions, it would be better to have a look at the conditions embodied in the contract itself.<br/><br/>7. So far as the conditions as to the time limit for the performance of contract are concerned, there cannot be any doubt about the intention of the parties. There is no ambiguity whatsoever in the language employ­ed for indicating their true intention as to time within which the parties were to fulfill their respective obligation under the contract.<br/><br/>8. Mr. Khondker referred to the case of <strong><em>Jadu Nath Gupta Vs. Chandra Bhusan   Sur, (1931) 36 CWN 285</em></strong> in support of the pro­position that ''where  the plaintiff is guilty of laches,  the Court would  not grant any relief to him even though time may not be  of the essence of the contract". It is seen that the plaintiff did not pay the balance within the specified time though sometime later; he offered a sum of money to the defendant who refused to accept the same. Plaintiff did not do anything further. Facts of the case are distinguishable from the present case before us which rather finds support indirectly from the observations made in the judgment of the aforesaid decision:                <br/>''Absence of proof of plaintiff's readi­ness and earnestness to perform his part of the contract will entitle the Court to exercise its discretion and refuse relief to him." <br/>Further, it held that <br/>''the grant of specific performance of a contract is discretionary, but the discretion is to be exercised according the facts and circumstances of a particular case". <br/><br/>9.The next case cited by the appellants’ counsel is <strong><em>Protab Chandra Koyal vs. Kali charan Acharya, (1951) 55 CWN 557</em></strong> which does not relate to a contract for sale of land but concerning an option to repurchase contained in an agreement.  It was held that "the option must be exercised strictly within the time limited in the contract".<br/><br/>10. The point involved in <strong><em>Maharaj Bahadur Singh Vs. Suresh Chandra Roy, (1921) CLJ 364</em></strong> relates to delay in filing a suit for specific performance of a contract to grant to he plaintiff putni lease, though actually limitation was saved by filing the suit three days before the time specified under Article 113, Schedule I, of the Limitation Act, the delay caused a material alteration in the value of the property because  it led the tenants to hope that the lease would never be given and to agree to pay enhanced rent in order  to prevent it from ever being given. Facts here are distingui­shable from those in the case before us.<br/><br/>11. Referring to the case of <strong><em>Jogesh Chandra Das Vs. Farida Hasan 1983 BLD 225 (AD</em>)</strong> where it was observed that "under section 22 of the Specific Relief Act a decree for specific performance of contract is discretionary and the Court is not bound to grant such relief merely because it is lawful to do so. Specific performance of contract is not to be granted as a matter of course".<br/><br/>12. Mr. Khondker urged us to consider these principles for refusing to grant relief to the plaintiff-respondent. Facts of that case show that consideration money for the contract was quite low and it was executed at a time when there was a civil disturbance in the country and members of the minority community were con­templating to migrate from this country. Other facts and circumstances showing the plaintiff's conduct were also considered in refusing specific performance of the contract. This case is, therefore, distinguishable.<br/><br/>13. The question, however, arises that if time was intended to be the essence of the con­tract, for whose default to honour his obliga­tions under the contract the same could not be performed? When time is made the essence of the contract under which parties thereto agree mutually to undertake certain obligations, it would, therefore, be necessary to find whose failure to carry out his obligations Within the time mentioned in the contract the same could not be performed. Judging the conduct of the parties from this view-point it appears that the plaintiff-respondent had established his read­iness and willingness to perform his obligation within the time stipulated in the contract. Evidence shows that the plaintiff-respondent offered the balance consideration money to the defendant-appellants within one month as agreed under the contract. Defendant-appellants did not, however, perform their obligations in obtaining the required certificates in time, further, on the pretext of their failure to obtain the certificates they refused to accept the balance consideration money. Not only they failed to honour their commitment to obtain the cert­ificates in time and execute the sale deed on accepting the balance consideration money, the defendant-appellants expressed their inten­tion to execute the same after obtaining the necessary certificates though one month's time had already elapsed. It is further seen that the plaintiff-respondents went on repeating their offer to pay the balance consideration money and demanding the execution of the sale deed until the defendant-appellants finally expressed their refusal to perform their part of the cont­ract. Where in any contract time is intended to be of the essence of the contract, it is not sufficient to find whether there was such in­tention or not, but it is necessary to find whose unwillingness to perform his part of the obligation under the contract eventually led to the non-performance of the contract. In a suit for specific performance of the contract which makes time the essence of the contract, the plaintiff must succeed if his readiness and willingness to perform the obligations undertaken by him are proved. This proposition finds support from the following decision.<br/><br/>14. As to when time is to be considered the essence of contract, the case of <strong><em>Gomathinayagam Pillai Vs Palaniswami Nadar, AIR 1967 SC 868</em></strong> was cited by Mr. B.N. Chowdhury, Counsel for the plaintiff-respondent. Facts involved in this case show that A agreed to sell his land to R. Subsequently, A addres­sed a letter to R stating that the agreement of sale was subject to a specific undertaking that time was of the essence of the agreement and since R had failed to carry out the agree­ment, it stood cancelled. R subsequently in­stituted a suit against A for a decree for specific performance of the agreement, alleging that he was at all material times ready and willing to perform his part of the contract and to obtain the sale deed and. A had com­mitted breach of the contract. Trial Judge dismissed the suit holding that under the agreement time was of the essence that even if it be held otherwise R's default in not per­forming his part of the agreement within reasonable time after the date fixed in the agreement evidenced that R was never ready and willing to perform his part of the con­tract. On appeal the High Court held that time was not of the essence of the agreement, that there was no delay on part of R to per­form his part of the agreement and decreed the suit. The High Court did not consider the effect of trial court's finding that R was not ready and willing to perform his part of the agreement. It was held by the Sup­reme Court by a majority decision that mere default by R would not have entitled him to decree if he had proved that he was ready and willing to perform his part of the contract.<br/><br/>15. As the plaintiff-respondents have successfully proved their readiness and willingness to pay the balance of the consideration money within the stipulated period of time, there being no controversy regarding the failure of the defendant-appel­lants to perform their obligations within such period, the suit for specific performance cannot fail.<br/><br/>16. As there has been a time lapse -between the date of execution of the sale -deed and the date of the decree and it appears from evidence that one of the reasons of the defen­dant-appellants' refusal to execute the kabala unless Tk. 15.000/- is paid over and above the balance consideration money, some considera­tion may be made for ordering the payment of a reasonable sum of money to the defendant-appellants as solatium. The contention that it would cause hardship to the defendant-appellants if specific performance is ordered after the lapse of so many years, particularly when the prices of land have gone up considerably since the date of contract, cannot be accepted for the simple reason that the Court in such cases is to give effect to the bargain struck off between the parties. The intention of the parties to a contract cannot be nullified by holding to the contrary, because the sanctity of contract would then vanish. All formal transactions like a contract of sale of property are solemnly entered and cannot, therefore, be trifled with. Moreover, the contention that it was a part of the home­stead of the defendant-appellants could not be substantiated, as it was found that they resided in a different village in their homestead measuring .48 acres of land. Their purpose to sell the suit land was to do fish business and also to buy more profitable land with the money obtained by sales<br/><br/>17. For the reasons stated above, the appeal is dismissed. The judgment and decree of the High Court Division affirming those of the trial court are affirmed with following modification, that the plaintiff-respondent No. 1 will pay to the defendant-appellants a sum of Tk. 15,000/- as solatium in addition to the balance consideration money.<br/>There will be no order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
