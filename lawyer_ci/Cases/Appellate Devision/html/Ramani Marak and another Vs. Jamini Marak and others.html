Facts are that Respondents 1, 2 and 20 filed OC Suit No. 336 of 1975 in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Tangail for declaration of their title in the suit properties, claiming that the property originally belonged to one Ifrimoni Garoani and they were her great grand daughters through her daughter Midong. The suit was contested by the first appellant saying that the suit property was self-acquired properties of Ramjan Garo and it was so recorded in his name in CS Khatian. Ramjan Garo died leaving his wife (defendant No. 1) as the legal heir who has been enjoying the suit properties being in possession for more than 12 years. First appellant as plaint at filed OC Suit No. 66 of 1975 in the same Court for declaration in respect of the self same properties making the plaintiffs of the other suit as the defendants along (<em>sic</em>) with others. Both the suits were tried analogously and dismissed by the same judgment on December 31, 1976. Against the judgment and decree passed in OC Suit No. 335 of 1975 two plaintiffs, namely, Respondents I and 2 filed an appeal in the High Court Division being FAT No. 363 of 1977 and the same is still pending. In the said appeal Respondents 1 and 2 filed an application for temporary injunction restraining the appellant from interfering with their possession in the suit land. Prayer for injunction was opposed, saying that the respondents could not legally make a prayer for temporary injunction in the suit for declaration <em>simpliciter. </em>It was further contended that the respondents' possession in the suit property was not accepted by the learned Subordinate Judge. The learned Judges of the High Court Division, however, accepting the case of the respondents found it a fit case for restraining the appellants and so issued the order of temporary injunction.<br/><br/>3. Leave was granted to consider whether in view of the decision in the case of <strong><em>Kanti Ram Shil Vs.</em></strong><em> <strong>Sumitra Devi 16 DLR 272 </strong></em>and in the case of <strong><em>Mosharraf Hossain Vs. Bangladesh Jute Industries Corporation 29 DLR (SC) 168 </em></strong>the injunction granted by the High Court Division was done on correct principles.<br/><br/>4. So far as the case of Mosharraf Hossain is concerned, it is to be observed, that the matter related to service, and it was observed that where the question of smooth working of public administration or national economy is involved, the rule of balance of convenience is to refuse the prayer for temporary injunction. The relevance of this decision, though of importance, is not attracted to the distinguishing facts of this case.<br/><br/>5. Mr. Miah A Gafur, learned Advocate‑on­ Record, of course, gives emphasis on the authority of <strong><em>Kanti Ram Shil's </em></strong>case, where it has been held that in a suit for declaration of title to lands <em>simpliciter </em>without any prayer for consequential relief, the plaintiff is not entitled to ask for temporary injunction against the defendants restraining them from interfering with plaintiffs' alleged possession of the suit land. In that suit, it was found that the plaintiffs had not merely failed to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of title to and possession of the suit land, but on their own averment the prima facie case is in favour of the defendants. On such finding the temporary injunction was refused. The decision on the finding, therefore, was correct. It is to be observed that the principle is generally applicable to case where in a suit for title relating to immovable roperty is filed, and consequential prayer ought to have been made, but has not been made, and an injunction is sought for. Normally this rule is to be observed, but it cannot be taken as an absolute rule, because if the suit is otherwise maintainable, and if it is found that the defendant without being in possession, wants to disturb the possession, the Court cannot be powerless to grant temporary injunction in an appropriate case. The order granting injunction must be a speaking order.<br/><br/>6. The facts have already been set out earlier. If we now turn to the findings of the learned Judges of the High Court Division on the basis of which the injunction has been granted we find that it has  been clearly found by them by referring to the evidence of defendant that<br/>"She was not in possession of the suit land but the petitioners were in possession thereof. In the circumstances, we think it is a fit case for restraining the opposite parties from interfering with the petitioners' possession."<br/><br/>7. After making this finding the injunction was granted in the following terms:<br/>"The opposite parties are restrained by an order of temporary injunction from interfering with the petitioners' possession of the suit land excepting the homestead portion thereof till disposal of the appeal."<br/><br/>8. The finding of possession by the High Court Division and the consequential order of injunction made by it are fully consistent with the principle for the grant of temporary injunction, and also reveals the utmost care taken by them in making an order which calls for no interference.<br/>This appeal is, therefore, dismissed with costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
