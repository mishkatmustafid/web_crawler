Tafazzul Islam J.</strong>- This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 22.3.2007 of the High Court Division passed in Civil Revision No. 5361 of 1998 discharging the Rule obtained against the judgment and decree dated 30.9.98 of the learned Additional District Judge Jhalakati passed in Title Appeal No.10 of 93 dismissing the appeal filed against those of dated 31.10.92 of the learned Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Jhalakati passed in Title Suit No.49 of 1990 declar­ing that the plaintiffs have no right title and interest in the suit land.<br/><br/>2. Facts, in brief, are that the petitioners, as plaintiffs, filed the above suit for decla­ration of their title on 3.781½ acres of land described in schedule Ka of the plaint and also for declaration that the compro­mise decree dated 17.6.77 passed in Title Suit No.68 of 1997 in respect of the above Ka schedule property, being obtained  fraudulently, is not binding upon them on the averments that the Ram Ratan Bal, the defendant No. 2, was the original owner of the suit land and he on 9.10.71 sold the same to them at a consideration of Tk.3000/- and since then they had been in possession of the same by mutating their names and that the defendant No.1 is the son of Shamvu Nath Bal, a co-sharer of the suit land and due to insolvency they were not in a position to purchase the suit land or to file an application and during liberation war the defendant No.1 left for India and he then succeeded in obtaining the above compromise decree on 17.6.77 by showing that he obtained the suit land in the year 1354 B.S. by pattan but at that time the defendant No.1 was not born and in fact the alleged decree was obtained collusively by suppressing summons.<br/><br/>3. The defendant No.1 contested the suit and filed written statement denying all the material allegations and contending that the suit land originally belonged to Ram Ratan Bal and Sarada Charan Bal and he took pattan of the said land in 1354 B.S. at a rent of Tk.35/- and since then he is in possession in the suit land and he filed Title Suit No.68 of 1977 for declaration of his title in the suit land which was decreed on compromise on 17.6.1977.<br/><br/>4.  The learned Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), after hearing, decreed the suit in part reject the prayer for declaration of the title of the plaintiff in the suit property but setting aside the compromise decree dated 17.6.19977 passed in Title Suit No.68 of 1977. Being aggrieved, the plaintiffs filed Title Appeal No.10 of 1993 and the defendants filed Title Appeal No.202 of 1992 and the learned Additional District Judge, Jhalakati who heard both the appeals anal­ogously dismissed Title Appeal No.10 of 1993 and allowed Title Appeal No.202 of 1992. On revision the High Court Division discharged the Rule.<br/><br/>5. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the plaintiffs purchased the suit land on 9.10.1971 from Ramratan Bal and since then they are in possession by mutating their name and they also proved the true copy of kabala deed, Ext. 4, order for mutation Ext.1 and the concerned rent receipts Ext. 3 series and further the witnesses of the plaintiffs categorically stated that the plaintiffs are in possession of the suit land and defendant No.1 is not in possession of the same and that P.W.3 is the Head Master of Kathalia Pilot High School, who used to know the signature of defendant No.1 issued a certificate Ext.5 wherein the  date of birth of  Gopal Chandra the defendant No.1 was shown on 30.4.1950 and so the trial Court disbe­lieved the taking of pattan by the defen­dant No.1 in the year 1354 B.S, as in the year 1354 B.S, defendant No.1 was not even born and the High Court Division did not at all controvert the above findings of the learned Trial Court as to taking pattan of the suit land by the defendant No.1.<br/><br/>6. As it appears the High Court Division discharged the Rule holding that the plain­tiff No.1, who himself was examined as P.W.1, in his deposition admitted that Ram Ratan Bal went to India during liber­ation war and returned back after libera­tion of Bangladesh and P.W.2 also admit­ted the said fact that Ram Ratan Bal went to India during Pakistan Regime and returned back to Bangladesh after libera­tion and it is the case of the plaintiff that they purchased the suit land by a kabala dated 9.10.1971 and the evidence of P.Ws.1 and 2, transpires the said deed has not been executed and registered by the Ram Ratan Bal and moreover the witness­es of the defendants proved the possession of the defendants in the suit land and the courts below believing the same held that the plaintiff failed to prove his case and moreover so far the second declaration sought by the plaintiff there is no material on record by which the compromise decree passed in Title Suit No.68 of 1977 could be declared illegal or void.<br/><br/>7. We are of the view that the High Court Division on proper consideration of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision and there is no illegality or infir­mity in the above decision so as to call for any interference.<br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed. <br/><br/> </div></div></div>
