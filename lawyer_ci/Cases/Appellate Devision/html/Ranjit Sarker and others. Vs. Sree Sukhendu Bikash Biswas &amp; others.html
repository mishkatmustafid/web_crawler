No. 323 of 1991 (Dhaka).</div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"> <br/><strong>Judgment</strong></span><br/><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bimalendu Bikash Roy Choudhury J. - </strong>This appeal by leave has been preferred by defendant Nos. 6(ka) - 6 (uma) against the judgment and decree dated 27April 1994 of a Division Bench of the High Court Division in F.A. No. 11 of 1984 (Chittagong), subsequently renumbered 323 of 1991 (Dhaka), which, reversing those of the Subordinate Judge, Patiya, decreed the plaintiff's suit, Other Suit No. 163 of 1981 in part.<br/><br/>2. The patent facts are that the suit homestead with its adjuncts and adjoining thank, ditch etc. originally belonged to Kailash Dey. Kailash was survived by his two sons Krishna Chandra and Kshetra Mohan. Krishna Chandra at his death left behind his three sons, plaintiff Sudhendu, defendant No. 3 Nirmalendu, Ardhendu and Purnendu, besides his widow, defendant No. 4 Kiron Bala. Ardhendu and Purnendu died unmarried to be succeeded by his two surviving brothers- the plaintiff and defen­dant No. 3. Krishan died leaving behind one son defendant No. 2 Kanu and his widow. Defendant No. 5 Kanu executed a deed of sale (Ext.4) on 1 August 1979 which was registered on 12 September 1980 in favour of defendant No. 1 Chandra Shekhar Mallick who was a stranger to the holdings to which the suit property appertains for a consideration of Tk. 8,000/=. On 23 November 1979 when the deed of sale dated 1 August 1979 was presented for reg­istration a deed of agreement for recon­veyance of the property under sale (Ext. D) was executed by defendant No. 1 on stamp purchased by him on 19 October 1979 stip­ulating that he would recovery the proper­ty whenever he received back the consider­ation money. On 28 July 1980 defendant No.1 executed and registered two deeds of reconveyance in respect of the property in favour of defendant No.2 who in his turn on the same date executed and registered two deeds of sale in favour of defendant No.6 Suresh and his mother defendant No. 7.<br/>2. On 29 September 1980 the plaintiff brought the suit in the Court of Munsif at Patiya which was subsequently transferred to the Court of Subordinate Judge of that place for pre-empting the suit property and also for declaring that the two registered deeds of reconveyance executed by defen­dant No.1 in favour of defendant No.2 on 28 July 1980 as well as the two deeds of sale executed by defendant No. 2 in favour of defendant No.7 on the same date were colourable deeds without consideration. The plaintiff claimed that the deed of sale dated 1 August 1979 was a deed of out and out sale and that he was a co-sharer in the suit holdings and defendant No. 1 was a stranger thereto.<br/><br/>3. In course of the proceedings of the suit defendant No. 6 died and his heirs were substituted in his place as defendant Nos.6 (ka) 6(uma).<br/>Defendant No.1 filed a written state­ment supporting the case of the plaintiff while defendant No.2 and defendant Nos. 6 (ka) - 6(uma) and defendant No. 7 contested the suit. Their contention was that the deed of sale under pre-emption was in fact a deed of mortgage to secure a loan of Tk. 8,000/-on repayment of which defendant No.1 had reconveyed the suit property to defendant No.2 by the two deeds of reconveyance. Again defendant No. 2 sold the suit proper­ty to defendant No.6 (since deceased) and his mother defendant No.7 on receipt of the consideration of Tk.72,000/-. In substance the defence case was that the deeds assailed by the plaintiff were not colourable deeds but genuine deeds.<br/><br/>4. On consideration of the facts and cir­cumstances of the case and the evidence on record the trial court dismissed the suit. The unsuccessful plaintiff then took an appeal there form to the High Court Division which, by the impugned judgment, reversed the decision of the trial court and decreed the suit in part allowing preemption.<br/><br/>5. In terms of the leave granted by this Court the only question involved in the appeal is whether the judgement of the High Court Division is a proper judgment of reversal.<br/><br/>6. Appearing in support of the defen­dant-appellants Khandaker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, learned Counsel submits that the learned Judges of the High Court Division did not consider all the material facts and circumstances and the evidence taken into consideration by the trial Court and advert to its reasoning nor did they reverse all the material findings of the said Court. He also maintains that the recoveyance having already taken place before the institution of the suit by the plaintiff and there being no finding that the reconveyance to the vendor, defendant No.2 was sham the suit was to fail, and there was also no scope for passing a part decree.<br/><br/>7. In reply Mr. S.R. Pal, learned Counsel has attempted to argue that in view of section 47 of the Registration Act the agreement for reconveyance was subse­quent to the kabala under pre-emption and so the learned Judges of the High Court Division rightly decreed the suit allowing pre-emption.<br/><br/>8. It appears that the trial court came to the findings that agreement Ext. D dated 23.11.79 executed by defendant No.1 in favour of defendant No.2 was a genuine document, that the kabala dated 1.8.79 was subject to an agreement for reconveyance, that the said kabala was never an out and our sale deed and that the suit was not main­tainable. In coming to the above conclusion the said court took into consideration, besides the oral evidence of the witnesses and the attending circumstances, the utterly low price shown in the kabala under pre­emption and the execution of the deed of agreement on the date of presentation of the kabala in question as indicative that the kabala under pre-emption was in fact a deed of mortgage to secure a loan. With regard to the evidence of D. W.1 and D. W.2 the court observed: The evidence of D.W. 1 appears to be against the contents of Ext. 4 and D. It appears that the suit was instituted on 29.9.80 but defendant No.1 filed the written statement on 21.7.83 i.e. after fixa­tion of the peremptory hearing. I am of view that defendant No. 1 having been gained over by the plaintiff filed the written statement contending false and baseless allegations and that he has given perjured evidence'. The trial court further found that the two deeds of reconveyance as well as the two subsequent deeds of sale were gen­uine documents. In arriving at this finding as well the trial court considered the inter­nal evidence of the documents and also the oral evidence of the witnesses adduced by the parties. On consideration of the oral evi­dence the trial court found further that defendant Nos. 6 (ka) – 6 (uma) and defendant No.7 were in possession of the suit property by virtue of the aforesaid deeds of reconveyance and the deeds of sale dated 28 July 1980. The said court relied on the evidence of D. W. 2- D. W. 6 besides series of dakhilas (Ext. C. series) showing pay­ment of rent for the suit property and disbe­lieved the evidence of the P.Ws. in coming to its conclusion. Accordingly the trial Court came to the conclusion that the plaintiff failed to prove that the aforesaid deeds of reconveyance and the subsequent deeds of sale, all dated 28 July 1980, were collusive and colourable.<br/><br/>9. The appellate court set aside the judg­ment of the trial court and decreed the suit in part allowing pre-emption. In arriving at its decision the appellate court was of the view that since the deed of agreement for reconveyance was not contemporaneous to the execution of the kabala under pre-emp­tion, the deeds of reconveyance being sub­sequent to the said kabala could not defeat the right of pre-emption of the plaintiff. The said court referred to the agreement for reconveyance (Ext. D) and observed that there was a mention in the same about oral agreement for reconveyance from the date of execution of the said deed and that this would be treated as a subsequent agreement which could not take away the character of the deed of sale under pre-emption, but did not at all advert to the reasoning of the trial court in this respect. It is also patent that the appellate court did not reverse the finding of the trial court that the plaintiff failed to prove that the agreement for reconveyance (Ext. D), the disputed deeds of recon­veyance and subsequent sales were collu­sive, fraudulent etc. The appellate Court observed: It is not necessary, therefore, for us to decide whether other four sale deeds in question are sham or invalid deeds in view of the legal position that second, sixth and seventh defendants took the property with the infirmity attaching to the title of the first defendant's title so that from the date of pre-emption their title also would be destroyed".<br/><br/>10. The facts narrated here above clearly indicate that the appellate court failed to advert to the specific reasoning of the trial court nor has it discussed all the material evidence taken into consideration by the trial court. The gross omission made by the said court is in respect of the clear findings that the deed of agreement for reconveyance (Ext. D), the deeds of recon­veyance and the subsequent deeds of sale were genuine. This goes to the root of the merit of the case since no relief could be granted to the plaintiff without coming to any finding that any of the said deeds other than the deeds of sale under pre-emption were sham. In the circumstances the con­tention of the learned Counsel for the respondent fails.<br/><br/>11. In the result, the appeal be allowed, the judgment and decree of the High Court Division be set aside and the case be sent back to that court for fresh disposal in accordance with law and in the light of the observations made here in above. There will be no order as to costs. The appeal may be heard by any Division Bench of the High Court Division other than the one which heard the matter earlier.<br/>Ed.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div></div></div>
