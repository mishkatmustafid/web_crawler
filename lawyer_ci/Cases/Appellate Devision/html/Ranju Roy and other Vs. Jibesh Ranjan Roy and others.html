Tafazzul Islam J. -</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 24.1.2006 of the High Court Division passed in Civil Revision No. 3898 of 1997 discharging the Rule.<br/><br/>2. Facts, in brief, are that Mohen Bashi Roy, the predecessor of the petitioners, filed Title Suit No.36 of 1985 in the Court of the then Munsif (now Assistant Judge), Derai, Sunamganj for declaration of his right, title and interest in the suit land and for further declaration that the <em>ex parte</em> decree dated 27.5.1985 of the same very Court passed in Title Suit No. 30 of 1985 is illegal, void and not binding upon him on the averments that the suit land belonged to Raj Chandra who died leaving behind three sons namely Mukunda, Bipin and Manindra and after the death of Mukunda and Bipin the entire property devolved up Manindra; in the year 1972 Manindra who was ailing due to his old age brought the plaintiff to his own house and since then the plaintiff had been resid­ing with Manindra; Manindra having died without any issue, the entire property devolved upon Arun Chandra Shil, the heir of Manindra; the plaintiff continued his possession in the suit homestead with the permission of Arun Chandra Shil who on 23.6.1985, at a consideration of Tk.15,000/-, along with other lands, also sold the suit land to the plaintiff by a reg­istered kabala; the defendant No.1 in June 1985 for the first time, claimed the suit land on the basis of a managed <em>ex parte</em> judgment and decree dated 27.5.1985 passed in Title Suit No.30 of 1985 in which only the Government was impleaded as a party and further the averments made in the plaint of Title Suit No.30 of 1985 are not correct and that the alleged kabala dated 15.12.1936 as mentioned in the above plaint was an outcome of for­gery and the said kabala was never acted upon.<br/><br/>3. The defendant No.1 contested the suit by filing written statement contending that Jadhunath was the original owner of the suit land and Raj Chandra, who was his under raiyat, took a loan of Tk. 172/- from Jadhunath and being unable to the pay that loan Raj Chandra, by kabala dated 15.12.1936, sold the suit land along with other land to Jadhunath and after the above transfer Raj Chandra, having no other land of his own for his living, start­ed living in the suit land with his family members with the permission of Jadhunath and after the death of Raj Chandra, his three sons Mukunda, Bipin and Manindra, with the permission of Jadhunath, resided therein; Jadhunath having died leaving his son Jogesh Chandra the father of the defendant No.1 and then Mukunda, Bipin and Manindra with the permission of Jogesh Chandra, resided therein; Mukunda, Bipin and Manindra and Mukunda having died without leaving any issue, Jogesh Chandra transferred the suit land to the defendant No. 1 by a registered will on the basis of which he owned and possessed the suit land and since he had been possessing the suit land physically, the preparation of the S.A. record in the name of Bipin and oth­ers was wrong; the defendant No.1 after coming to know about the wrong record­ing of S.A. record, filed Title Suit No.30 of 1985 in Falgun 1391 which was decreed on 25.5.1985. The plaintiff having requested the defendant No.1 to accom­modate him in the suit premises for same period, he out of sympathy, allowed the plaintiff to stay in the suit premises and the alleged deed on the basis of which the 'plaintiff claimed title is fraudulent and the plaintiff had not title in the suit land.<br/><br/>4. The learned Assistant Judge, after hear­ing, decreed the suit. Being aggrieved the defendant No.1 preferred Title Appeal No.43 of 1986 and the learned Additional District Judge Sunamganj, after hearing, by judgment and decree dated 6.8.1997 allowed the appeal and thereby dismissed the suit. On revision the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.3839 of 1987, after hearing, discharged the Rule.<br/><br/>5. We have heard the learned advocate-on-record for the petitioner and perused the impugned judgment and order and the connected papers.<br/><br/>6. As it appears the High Court Division found that Mohan Bashi Roy, the plaintiff, without  filing the kabala deed  dated 23.6.1985 allegedly executed by Arun Chandra Shill in his favour which is the basic document of his title, merely submit­ted a certified copy of the same and also took no steps to prove the transfer of title in his favour and the records of the appel­late Court did not show that the original kabala deed dated 23.6.1985 was ever submitted before the learned Additional District Judge nor any prayer was made by the plaintiff to enable him to prove the fact of said transfer; further the trial Court decreed the suit assuming that the plaintiff having proved his possession in the suit land for more than the statutory period of limitation acquired title by adverse pos­session although the plaintiff, in 'the plaint, did not seek declaration of title in the suit land on the basis of adverse pos­session; moreover the plaintiff, who examined him as P.W.1, in his cross-examination admitted that he started to reside in the suit homestead as a licensee under Manindra; further the plaintiff had set up his claim of possession firstly as a licensee under Manindra and thereafter on the strength of the kabala deed dated 23.6.1985 executed by Arun Chandra Shil in his favour, the subsequent claim of the plaintiff on the basis  of kabala dated 23.6.1986 has  no basis  at all because admittedly the suit land is situated within the territorial jurisdiction of Derai Sub-registry Office but the plaintiffs kabala dated 23.06.86 allegedly executed by Arun Chandra Shil was registered at the Sunamganj Sub-registry Office on includ­ing fictitious land only to attract the juris­diction of Sunamganj Sub-registry Office and further the plaintiff had failed to pro­duce any document at the trial to show that the  land  included  in the kabala belonged to Arun Chandra Shil nor any evidence is available on recorded to show that the  said  land  belonged  to Arun Chandra Shil; in view of the above the kabala dated 23.06.85, if any, being regis­tered offending the provision of section 28 of the Registration Act is nothing but a void deed. Further in the case of <strong><em>Abdus Samad Mohammad vs. Deputy Commissioner and Custodian of Vested Property and others </em></strong>reported in<strong><em> 52 DLR (AD) 121</em></strong> it has "been held that posses­sion for more than the statutory period of limitation as a licensee does not create any title.<br/><br/>7. We are of the view that the High Court Division on proper consideration of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision. The learned counsel could not point at any illegality or infirmity in the decision of the High Court Division so as to call for any interference.<br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
