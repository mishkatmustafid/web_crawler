Abdul Matin J. - </strong>This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 02.08.2007 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 4795 of 2005 making the Rule absolute and setting aside the judg­ment and order dated 05.09.2005 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 3rd Court, Sylhet in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 84 of 2004 dismissing the appeal and affirming the judgment and order dated 21.08.2004 passed by the learned Senior Assistant Judge, Beanibazar, Sylhet in Title Suit No.51 of 2004 granting and order of temporary injunction under order 39 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/>2. The facts, in short, are that the plaintiff-petitioner Nos.1-4 filed Title Suit No. 51 of 2004 along with an application for tem­porary injunction against the defendant-respondent No.1 on 06.06.2004. The suit was for declaration that the judgment and order dated 06.09.1999 obtained by the defendant-respondent in Miscellaneous (Pre-emption) Case No. 21 of 1998 is ille­gal, null and void, inoperative, fraudulent, unexecutable and liable to be set aside and the plaintiffs-petitioner Nos.1-4 and pro-forma-respondent No.15 are not bound by that judgment  and also for permanent injunction restraining the defendant-resplendent No.1 from evicting the plain­tiff- petitioners from any part of suit land by putting the said judgment and order in execution.<br/><br/>3. The averments made in the plaint of the suit as well as the application for tempo­rary injunction in brief was that though the defendant-respondent No.1 is a stranger yet he obtained an <em>ex parte</em> judgment and order in Miscellaneous (Pre-emption) Case No.21 of 1998 on 06.09.1999 chal­lenging a deed of gift dated 04.01.1998 which was not maintainable under section 96(10) (a) of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950. When the plaintiff-petitioner Nos.1-4 and pro forma respon­dent No.15 came to learn about the said <em>ex parte</em> order they filed Miscellaneous Case No. 27 of 1999 under Order 9 Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure for set­ting aside the said order and to restore the case to its original file and number but the same was rejected. They pursued the matter upto the Appellate Division but could not succeed and the said order was upheld upto the Appellate Division by judgment and order dated 17.04.2004 passed in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1040 of 2003 and then the defendant respondent was taking step hurriedly to take over possession of suit land in execu­tion and as such the plaintiff-petitioners were constrained to file the application for granting temporary injunction to restrain the defendant-respondent No.1 from evicting the plaintiff-petitioners from any part of the suit land by putting the illegal ex-parte judgment and order in execution.<br/><br/>4. In the plaint it was stated, <em>inter alia</em>, that the <em>ex parte</em> judgment and order dated 06.09.1999 obtained by defendant No.1 in Misc. (Pre) Case No. 21 of 1998 in respect of the land described in the schedule to the plaint, which is situated in Mouza Kunagram, under P.S. Beanibazar, Dist.- Sylhet, is against the provision of the sec. 96(10) (a) of the E.B.S.A. and T. Act and as such illegal, null and void, inoperative, fraudulent unexecutable and liable to be set aside and the plaintiffs are not bound by the said illegal <em>ex parte</em> order. The plaintiffs also prayed for permanent injunction restraining defendant No.1 from evicting the plaintiffs from any part of the suit land by putting the illegal <em>ex parte </em>order in execution.<br/><br/>5. It was also stated that the land described in schedule to the plaint belonged to defendant No.2 Dr. Shafar Uddin Ahmed, his mother Mosina Bibi and Kamar Uddin (father of the plaintiffs and proforma-defendant No.16 Sufia Begum) on the basis of settlement, purchase and gifts. During the last survey settlement opera­tion the suit land was recorded in their names jointly and was finally published without any objection from any quarter. The item No.1 of the suit land i.e. S.S. Plot No.1121 comprises an area of 0.56 deci­mals of land which is the paternal home­stead of the plaintiff-proforma defendant Nos.2 and 16 and was recorded in the names of proforma-defendant No.2 Dr. Shafar Uddin Ahamed, his mother Mosina Bibi and Kamar Uddin in equal share in final khatian No.414 of Mouza Kunagram. Similarly item No.2 of the suit land i.e. S.S. plot No.1128 was recorded in their names in equal share as bagan (orchard land) in the final khatian No.200 of Mouza Kunagram. Thereafter Mosina Bibi died leaving son proforma-defendant No.2 and he became the owner of 2/3rd share and the remaining 1/3rd share belonged to Kamar Uddin, father of the plaintiffs and proforma-defendant No.16. Karam Uddin was the foster brother of defendant No.2 Dr. Shafar Uddin Ahmed and they were in joint mess and Kamar Uddin was managing the ejmali family property as proforma defendant No.2, Dr. Shafar Uddin Ahmed has been residing in Sylhet town by purchasing a Bashabari for the sake of his profession.<br/><br/>6. It was also stated that Dr. Safar Uddin Ahmed and Kamar Uddin were very much close and affectionate to each other, just like full brothers. Dr. Shafar Uddin Ahmed is permanently residing in Sylhet town and in case of any necessity and social functions he visits the village home. The entire homestead and all other family properties were under the control and management of Kamar Uddin and Dr. Shafar Uddin Ahmed was not at all con­versant with the family properties. Although Kamar Uddin was in specific possession of the suit land and other lands but after the death of their mother Mosina Bibi both the brothers decided to partition the suit land amicably for further conven­ience. Accordingly a registered partition deed was executed on 19.03.1988. As the share of Kamar Uddin in the homestead is only 0.18 decimals Dr. Shafar Uddin Ahmed out of love and affection gave another 0.06 decimals land from his share to Kamar Uddin for his convenience. Thus according to the partition deed the share of Dr. Shafar Uddin Ahmed is 0.32 decimals and that of Kamar Uddin is 0.24 decimal in the homestead land. Although a formal deed of partition was executed between the, two brothers but the suit land was never demarcated or divided on the spot according to the said partition deed and remained as it is and Kamar Uddin was is actual possession of the homestead land and other lands as before.<br/><br/>7. It was further stated that Kamar Uddin died in the year 1993 leaving one son Mostaqur Rahman and 5 daughters plain­tiffs and proforma-defendant No.16 as his legal heirs. After the death of Kamar Uddin his son and daughters have been possession the entire homestead like their father and Dr. Shafar Uddin Ahmed is residing in Sylhet town, Dr. Shafar Uddin Ahmed had no issue and he had no other near relatives except the heirs of Kamar Uddin. So he loved the plaintiffs and pro-forma-defendant No. 16 as his full broth­er's daughters and out of love and affec­tion Dr. Shafar Uddin Ahmed gifted the suit land to the plaintiffs and proforma-defendant No.16 by a registered deed of gift dated 21st Poush 1404 B.S. corre­sponding to 04.01.1998 and delivered for­mal possession of the suit land as the plaintiffs and proforma-defendant No. 16 and their brother Mostaqur Rahman were in physical possession of the suit land. As the Suit land was never demarcated and separated on the spot and as there was no specific boundary of the share of Dr. Shafar Uddin Ahmed, so in the deed of gift he described the boundaries of both the plots and identified the gifted land stating that excluding your share my share 0.32 decimal in plot No. 1121 and 0.12 decimal in plot No. 1128 is gifted.<br/><br/>8. It was also stated that the defendant No.1 is a stranger, he is not a co-sharer in the holding Nos. 414 or 200. But after execution and registration of the gift deed dated 14.01.1998, the defendant No.1 Md. Maruf Uddin Ahmed filed the aforesaid Misc. (Pre) Case No. 21 of 1998 falsely claiming that although the suit land was transferred by a deed of gift but actually it is a sale deed and as co-sharer he is enti­tled to pre-empt the suit land and by sup­pressing notice managed to obtain an <em>ex parte</em> judgment and order on 06.09.1999. But as a matter of fact defendant No. 1 is not a co-sharer in the khatians which stand in the names of Dr. Shafar Uddin Ahmed, Mosina Bibi and Kamar Uddin (father of the plaintiff and proforma-defendant No. 16). Moreover as the plaintiffs and profor­ma-defendant No.16 are co-sharers by inheritance in the tenancy the said pre­emption case No.21 of 1996 was barred under section 96(10) (a) of the E.B.S.A &amp; T. Act. But the defendant No.1 suppress­ing all those facts and making false state­ments in the court obtained the said ex-parte judgment and order. As the Misc. (Pre) Case No. 21 of 1998 was barred by law the said ex-pare judgment and order is illegal and liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>9. It was further stated that in the aforesaid Misc. (Per) No.21 of 1998 the defendant No.1 stated that once upon a time his grandfather Kanu Miah and his brothers Irfan Ali, Nasai Miah and his step broth­er's son Yakub AH purchased the suit land and other lands. So his grandfather Kanu Miah was a co-sharer in the land pur­chased by those 4 persons and as the pur­chasers did not partition their purchased land, so as successive heir of Kanu Miah he is a co-sharer in the suit land. It is beyond imagination that after 2 genera­tions the properties purchased by his grandfather Kanu Miah along with other persons are still joint properties. As a mat­ter of fact during the last survey settlement operation the land purchased by Kanu Miah was duly recorded in the name of his heirs i.e. Shajjad Ali (father of defendant No.1) and others in plot No. 1125 which is their homestead, in plot No.1126 and in D.P. Khatian No.23 of 1972 and final Khatian No. 236 and they have been pos­sessing those land specifically by paying rent to the Government separately and they have no connection with the land of Khatian Nos. 414 and 200 which are in the names of proforma-defendant No. 2 Dr. Shafar Uddin Ahmed, Mosina Bibi and Kamaruddin and they had been holding and possessing the same specifically by paying rent to the Government separately. According to the provision of sec. 96 (1) E.B.S.A. and T. Act, only co-sharer of the holding and not the previous owner whose name is not in the holding can claim pre­emption as co sharers. As the name of defendant No.1 or his father or grandfa­ther is not in the Khatian the defendant No.1 is not a co-sharer in the holding and he had no <em>locus standi</em> to file the aforesaid Misc. (Pre) Case No. 21 of 1998. Moreover the name of Kamar Uddin was duly recorded in Khatian Nos. 414 and 200. So the plaintiffs and proforma-defendant No.16 who are daughters of Kamar Uddin are co-sharers by inheritance in the tenancy and the aforesaid pre-case was not maintainable against them. But as ill lack would have it the plaintiffs and proforma-defendant No. 16 could not file any written objection in Misc. (Pre) Case No.21 of 1998 stating the actual facts and taking the advantage of the absence of the plaintiffs and proforma-defendant No.11 the defen­dant No.1 had obtained the ex-parte judg­ment and order dated 06.09.1999 by prac­ticing fraud upon the court.<br/><br/>10. The defendant-respondent contested the same by filing a written objection con­tending, inter-alia, that the suit as well as the application for temporary injunction is not maintainable and that the plaintiffs-petitioners is not maintainable and that the plaintiffs-petitioners are strangers in the suit jote and the defendant-respondent No.1 is a co-sharer by inheritance in the case jote, and that the deed in question dated 04.01.1998 is an not and out sale deed in the garb of deed of gift as there was no relation between the doner and donee. It was also stated that the predeces­sor of plaintiffs, Kamaruddin had no right, title and interest in the case land and that the defendant-respondent No.1 had filed Miscellaneous (Preemption) Case No. 21 of 1998 against the plaintiff-petitioners and the same allowed by judgment and order dated 06.09.1999 within their knowledge against which a Miscellaneous Case No. 27 of 1999 was filed under Order 9 Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure for setting aside the said order and to restore the pre-emption case in its original umber but the same was rejected on contest on 18.07.2001 against which the plaintiff-opposite parties preferred Miscellaneous Appeal No.47 of 2001 which was also disallowed on contest on 03.06.2002 and thereafter the plaintiffs-petitioners filed Civil Revision No. 3438 of 2002 in the High Court Division against the order dated 03.06.2002 and after hear­ing both the parties the Rule was dis­charged on 12.03.2003 upholding the judgments and orders given by the courts below. Thereafter, the present plaintiff-petitioners preferred Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 1040 of 2003 in the Appellate Division Against the judgment and order dated 12.03.2003 passed by the High Court Division and after hearing both the parties in contest the same was dismissed on 17.04.2004 upholding the <em>ex parte</em> judgment and order dated 06.09.1999 of the trial court. It was also stated that in that way when the plaintiff-petitioners have lost upto Appellate Division on contest then they filed the present suit for setting aside the judgment and order dated 06.09.1999 and to stop the execution process by was of temporary injunction only to deprive the defendant No.1 from getting the fruit of his case. It was further stated that the plaintiffs have no legal right to challenge the said judgment and order and no judicial proceeding can be stopped or restrain by was of temporary injunction when the same was upheld on contest by the apex court of the country and as such the application for temporary injunction is liable to be rejected.<br/><br/>11. The trial Court allowed the prayer for temporary injunction and the same was affirmed by the appellate court but on revision the High Court Division set aside the judgment and order of both the courts below and hence this petition for lave to appeal.<br/><br/>12. Heard the learned Counsel and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/><br/>13. It appears that the respondent filed a pre-emption case which was allowed <em>ex parte</em> against the present petitioners who fought upto Appellate Division and lost. Thereafter the present petitioners have filed the suit for declaration that the <em>ex parte</em> judgment and order dated 06.09.1999 obtained in the pre-emption case is illegal, null, void, inoperative, fraudulent and not binding upon them. In that suit they made the prayer for tempo­rary injunction. The petitioners are yet to get the declaration. Admittedly they chal­lenged the selfsame judgment and order earlier and lost upto the Appellate Division. Therefore, the High Court Division has rightly set aside the judgment and order of the courts below as the peti­tioners are not entitled to such and order in a suit so framed.<br/><br/>We find no merit in this petition which is accordingly dismissed.<br/>Ed.<br/> <br/> </div></div></div>
