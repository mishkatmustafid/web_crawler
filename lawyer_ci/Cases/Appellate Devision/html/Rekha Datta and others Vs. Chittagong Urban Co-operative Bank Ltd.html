The appellants are plaintiffs. They filed a suit being Other Suits No. 60 of 1959/20 of 1961 in the Court of Subordinate Judge, 2nd Court, Chittagong for declaration and confirmation of possession on the ground, <em>inter alia, </em>that the sale in question in mortgage execution case is fraudulent one and the plaintiffs were not made parties therein and, as such, the sale is a nullity and the minors were not represented in the said execution case and there is gross under-valuation and the sale was effected at the instance of one Suren Datta, a tenant of the building in question in collusion with the defendant‑bank. The defendant denied the allegation<br/>and contended that the suit is not maintainable in the present form; that the suit is barred under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act and the plaintiffs have no subsisting interest in the disputed property and that the plaintiffs were properly represented in the execution proceeding in question and all the processes were properly served.<br/><br/>3. The trial Court dismissed the suit and appeal that was filed was also dismissed by the High Court Division. A good number of points were raised before the High Court Division, namely, (a) that the heirs being minors were not represented in the Court according to the mandatory provision laid down in sub‑rule (4) of rule 3 of Order 32 of the Code of Civil Procedure and their interests were not protected by the Court guardian; (b) that the sale in question was held fraudulently by suppressing all sale processes; (c) that there had been gross under-valuation of the property; (d) that the legal heirs of the deceased judgment debtor were not brought on record, instead, some fictitious names were given. The last point was argued vehemently before the High Court Division that the heirs of Nanibala were not substituted in the execution case and the High Court Division has erred in law in holding that the heirs of Nanibala were duly substituted although there is no such proof.<br/><br/>4. Leave was granted to consider whether the heirs of Nanibala were substituted in the execution case and whether the High Court Division was right in holding that the heirs of Nanibala were duly substituted and whether the mis‑description of one of the heirs, namely, that Kironbala being substituted as daughter of Nanibala as Usha Rani and whether such mis‑description has caused any prejudice.<br/><br/>5. Facts briefly are as follows: The disputed property was sold in auction in Mortgage Execution Case. No. 37 of 1954 of the First Court of Subordinate Judge, Chittagong. This property belonged to Nanibala, mother of the appellants who died leaving the plaintiffs as her heirs and at the time of her death the plaintiffs were minors. The plaintiff's father borrowed some money from the defendant-respondent bank and their mother stood surety and the disputed property was kept as security. The plaintiffs' case was that they were not aware that the disputed property was sold in Mortgage Case No. 37 of 1954; that after inspection of the record the plaintiffs came to know that the defendant bank instituted a Mortgage Dispute Case No. 55 of 1948‑49 against the father of the plaintiffs and obtained an award on 20.6.49 and Mortgage Execution case No. 37 of 1954 was started to realise the awarded money; that after the death of Nanibala her three daughters, namely, Kironbala Ghose, Manju Bala and Hashu Bala were substituted and these minors were represented by the Court guardian Mr. Manir Ahmed, a pleader.<br/><br/>6. Plaintiffs' case is, that they are three sisters, Usha, Rekha and Sikha but in the execution case above named fictitious names have been mentioned.<br/><br/>7. Evidence was led by both the parties and the trial Court came to the conclusion that the sale certificate, Ext. N shows that Kironbala, Manju Bala and Hashu Bala were made parties in place of deceased Nanibala Ghose. The trial Court considered the version of the plaintiffs that they were never known by these names and they produced their documentary evidence to show that they are known as Rekha, Sikha and Usha. Certified copies of the school register, school certificate and Immigration Certificate have been produced in support of the contention of the plaintiffs. The trial Court, however, built up a third case by saying:<br/>"It is well known to everybody that in our country most of the persons have at least two names …..They must have pet names and I am inclined to hold that Kiron, Manju and Hasu were the nick names of the plaintiffs. I think description by nick names is not irregular in a proceeding where the father's name is given"<br/>The trial Court came to such conclusion while considering the evidence of PW 3 "who stated that he had to admit in his cross‑examination that his daughters have nick names but he, however, says that he does not know if the plaintiffs have any other names". Then the trial Court considered the evidence and observed:<br/>"One party says that the plaintiffs are known as Usha, Rekha and Shika while the other party says that they were known as Kiron, Hasu and7Manju. Neither party says that if it is their nick names or if they had two or more names".<br/>Notwithstanding such evidence the trial Court came to the conclusion "But I am convinced that the plaintiffs have nick names and they were also known as Kiron, Hasu and Manju". Reliance was placed on Exhibit (J) which is the copy of the application for substitution filed in the partition suit by DL Ghose, brother of Roy Bahadur TL Ghose, the father of the plaintiffs. In this application the daughters of Roy Bahadur TL Ghose have been mentioned as Usha Rani alias Chanchola, Rekha alias Manju and Shika alias Hasu. The trial Court considered that so far as Manju and Hasu are concerned they have been sufficiently identified by their other names, namely Rekha and Shika respectively but so far as Usha Rani is concerned, the difficulty is that she has a nick name like Chanchola, whereas, evidence was given that Usha was also known as Kiron and in this view of the evidence it came to conclusion that plaintiffs were known as Kiron, Hasu and Manju and in this view of the matter it was held that they were correctly represented in the execution case.<br/><br/>8. As to the fraud, the trial Court considered that mere allegation could not establish fraud and it did not find any evidence which would show that the bank in collusion with some persons had sold the house in auction. In this view of the matter the suit was dismissed.<br/><br/>9. The High Court Division considered the evidence and found that Roy Bahadur TL Ghose had 3 daughters by his wife Nanibala Ghose and these daughters were named as Usha, Rekha and Shika. The High Court Division noticed that the evidence disclosed that the difference in the name of Usha Rani as transpired from the evidence as Kironbala but from Exhibit (J) inference was drawn that she was also known as Chanchola and the High Court Division also inferred that the evidence of DW 2 shows that Kironbala was known as Chanchola.<br/><br/>10. Now the question comes actually what happened about the names of all these plaintiffs. They have given their names as Rekha, Shika and Usha. In execution case the names were substituted as Kironbala, Manjubala and Hasu Bala. In Exhibit (J) reference is made that Shika alias Hasu, Rekha alias Manju, whereas. Usha is alias Chanchola. In the written statement Usha has been mentioned as alias Kiron Bala. This uncertainty in the description of the substituted heirs whether had caused any prejudice to them. Be it noted that they were minors and they were represented by a court guardian Mr. Manir Ahmed Chowdhury. It at once comes for consideration whether the plaintiffs were duly represented in the execution proceeding by their court guardian. The High Court Division considered the evidence that the court guardian did not enquire as to what property was advertised for sale, nor as to whether he contacted the minors. He also did not contact any of the other guardians. He only perused the official records and submitted the report, Exhibit (A). The High Court Division concluded that in the absence of any allegation of fraud made in the plaint, the plaintiffs were not entitled to challenge that the court guardian did not represent the interest of the plaintiffs. In this view of the matter the appeal was stated: also dismissed.<br/><br/>11. Leave was granted to consider whether the misdescription caused any prejudice.<br/><br/>12. Mr. Ahamad Sobhan, the learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff‑appellants contended that the High Court Division has erred in saying that there was no allegation of fraud in the plaint. He quoted the plaint. Para 3(d) runs thus:<br/>"That said minors were represented by the Court guardian Pleader Mvi Manir Ahmed, who did not make any enquiry and submitted his report though the names of the plaintiffs are not Manju, Hasu and defendant No. 2's name is not Kiron Bala."<br/>Paragraph 5 says that:<br/>"The defendant No. 2, it appears, to keep the fraudulent sale concealed took away symbolical possession. The plaintiffs and the defendant No. 2 are still in actual possession."<br/>In paragraph 6 it is stated that:     <br/>"The defendant No. 1 being fully aware of the defective sale and purchase is trying to sell the property to Surabala Dutta, wife of Suresh Ch. Dutta who was a tenant of the premises in order to put indirect pressure and to disturb the peaceful possession of the plaintiffs and the defendant No. 2."<br/><br/>13. Mr. Sobhan argued that they in collusion with the Bank had prepared to sell the house in question and that the property was a valuable property and the property had been sold for a mortgage debt of Taka 7,667.00. Mr. Sobhan then argued that the report of the Court guardian, Exhibit (A), shows that he did not take any interest in the execution proceeding on behalf of the minors. In Exhibit (A) it was stated that:<br/>"I have the honour to state that issued registered Card with A/D which was duly received by the natural guardian of the minors but he could neither contact me personally nor through an agent. Further, I have gone through the records and do not find any <em>prima facie</em> case for the minor's interest. I, therefore, submit my final report."<br/>Then Mr. Subhan refers to his evidence when he stated:<br/>"I issued registered postcard to the natural guardian of the minors. It was received by one Manoranjan Das on behalf of Roy Bahadur."<br/>In cross‑examination he admitted that the price of land would be about Taka 30,000.00 or so. He stated:<br/>“I did not enquire what property was advertised for sale. I ascertained everything from the record. I did not bring before the notice of the court the true value of the building. I was not present when Monoranjan received my card. I say his name from the receipt. I cannot say who actually received the postcard. I do not know Roy Bahadur. I cannot say if Monoranjan had any authority to receive the postcard. I cannot re‑collect wherefrom I collected the data that there was no <em>prima facie</em> case to contest on behalf of the minors."<br/><br/>14. Mr. Ahmed Sobhan argued that the daughters of Roy Bahadur Tejendra, Lal Ghose were minors and after the death of their mother, Nanibala, the judgment-debtor, they were substituted but their names and particulars were not correctly recorded and therefore they never received any notice of the execution proceeding, etc. The Court guardian who was appointed was clearly negligent in performing his duties because he never looked after the interest of the plaintiffs. On his own admission he did not contact the minors, nor ascertained the valuation of the property that war, going to be sold, nor did he do anything to discharge his function as a guardian <em>ad litem. </em>He simply filed his report Exhibit (A) and when he was cross examined he could not say from whom he got the information that there was nothing for the minors to contest in this execution proceeding. Plaintiff Rekha stated in her evidence that their tenant Suren Dutta, his wife Sura Bala in collusion with the Urban Bank authority had caused the auction. She stated how they were neglected by their father and how her mother reared them up. She mentioned that her maternal uncle Monoranjan Das was responsible for the second marriage of her father against the will of her mother and this was only done to sell out the property of her father. This Monoranjan appeared to have played a prominent role in the auction case. The evidence of the Pleader‑Guardian is that he wrote a letter to Monoranjan Das which was received by him. It is unfortunate that the guardian <em><img src="file:///C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image002.gif" style="height:16px; width:16px"/>ad litem </em>had completely neglected his duty in spite of the evidence that the plaintiffs were not on good terms with Monoranjan Das. How could the Court guardian be satisfied when the registered postcard was received by Monoranjan Das, though in cross‑examination he stated that he could not say actually who received the postcard. He admitted that he could not say if Monoranjan had any authority to receive the postcard. Plaintiffs' allegation is borne by the deposition of Khagendra Chandra Das, DW 2<br/>when he said:<br/>"After our purchase we have contracted to sell the house of Surendra for Rs. 10,000.00. The bank is concerned with money".<br/>This witness stated that he conducted the case on behalf of the bank but he had no personal knowledge about the service of processes. Thus the position which emerges is that these plaintiffs were minors during the relevant period and a Court guardian who was appointed under Order XXXII of the Code of Civil Procedure was grossly negligent about his duties and in consequence a valuable property of the minors was sold in auction for a debt of Taka 7000.00 which, according to both the sides, would be over Taka 30,000.00. The evidence is that this property is located at Anderkilla and near the court hills which is the heart of the Chittagong Town.<br/><br/>15. In the case of <strong><em>Mst. Siraj Fatima Vs. Mahmood Ali AIR 1932 (All) 293</em></strong> the Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court observed that:<br/>"The real basis of the binding character of a decree against a minor is the fact of his having been duly represented by a proper person, and not the mere existence of any formal order appointing a guardian for him. Even when there be such an order, if the guardian does not properly represent him, the decree would not be binding."<br/>It was further observed that:<br/>"Even where a guardian has been formally appointed but he is grossly negligent in his duties, he ceases to represent the minor properly and effectively, and the result is the same as if no proper guardian had been in existence. It is the duty of the court to see that the guardian appointed is a proper person who would safeguard the interest of the minor. If therefore the guardian ceases to take any interest in the case or is grossly negligent so as to sacrifice the interest of the minor, it cannot be said that the minor is still properly represented in the litigation. Willful and wanton neglect on the part of the guardian disqualifies him. This also therefore appears to be a basis on which the avoidance of decree against the minor can be allowed".<br/>It was further stated that negligence in order to be good ground for the avoidance of a decree must be of such a nature as to justify the inference that the minors' interests were not at all protected and therefore he was not properly represented. It was further observed that:<br/>"Gross negligence includes inexcusable absence of such ordinary care which under the circumstances of the case a prudent man was bound to take to safeguard his interest or that of a person who was dependent upon him. Where the prudent man abandons his prudence without any excuse in the conduct of any affair affecting the interest of his wards he must be held to be guilty of negligence. Where negligence is established liability follows for all resultant consequences."<br/>In that decision the Full Bench surveyed the case laws on the subject and came to the conclusion that a decree against a minor could be avoided if it was proved that the Court guardian was negligent in the performance of his duties.<br/><br/>16. Mr. BB Roy Chowdhury, the learned Counsel appearing for the respondent, argued that the plaintiffs had failed to prove fraud in the execution proceeding and therefore the decree should not be set aside.<br/><br/>17. As has been mentioned in the plaint the plaintiffs had specifically stated about the fraudulent sale itself and that is why it was stated that the defendant No. 1 took only symbolical possession. The trial Court simply brushed aside the point by saying that the allegation of fraud was not taken  seriously in the plaint or in the evidence nor was it taken at the time of execution proceeding and therefore it did not consider that the sale was vitiated by fraud. The plaintiffs alleged that the house had been under‑valued and the real value was Taka 30,000.00 to Taka 40,000.00 and it was auction sold for Taka 7000.00 only and the Bank had purchased it in auction sale and they were trying to sell it to Surendra for Taka 10,000.00. The allegation of the plaintiffs is that Surendra was althrough behind the screen for getting the house sold on auction in collusion with the Bank and their mama Monoranjan Das who was hostile to them.<br/><br/>18. In the case of <strong><em>Iftekhar Hussain Vs. Beant </em></strong>Singh <strong><em>AIR 1946 (Lah) 233 </em></strong>the Full Bench of the Lahore High Court after discussing the case law came to the conclusion that a minor can avoid a decree against him on the ground of gross negligence on the part of his guardian <em>ad litem </em>even if he has not succeeded in proving fraud or collusion on the part of such guardian. <strong>Mahajan J,</strong> who was on the same Bench, went further and observed that to deny the minor the plea of gross negligence of his guardian in such cases is to deny him bare justice and is to handicap him to fight against his adversary who can always be compensated when the litigation is re‑opened by handsome Costs.<br/>It was observed that:<br/>"In some cases this rule has been sought to be justified on the ground that cases of gross negligence of guardian of a minor stand on the same footing as fraud and collusion and that gross negligence in instance similar to the one I have given amounts to fraud. I cannot subscribe to this view because gross negligence and fraud are in law two mutually exclusive concepts though the same facts may be evidence either of one or the other. In my view, therefore, apart from fraud, gross negligence of the guardian itself without more is a ground to vacate a judgment against a minor and is sufficient to re‑open the previous litigation."<br/><br/>19. This is a correct proposition of law and the terms of Order XXXII of the Code of Civil Procedure clearly show that this duty of the guardian <em>ad litem </em>continues throughout the execution proceeding also. By the gross negligent act of the guardian the minors in the present case had suffered substantial injury and a valuable property had been sold for a petty amount behind their back. They knew nothing about it and after the death of their mother though they were substituted in the execution proceeding even their names and particulars were not correctly given in the proceeding and notices of the execution proceeding were not served upon them. The Court guardian himself contended by saying that the letter was received by Monoranjan who already in evidence had figured as a person who was hostile to the minors. In this view of the matter the trial Court had taken a wrong view about the allegation of fraud and the High Court Division also did riot advert to this plea carefully. In this view of the matter the opinion is that this suit must be decreed.<br/><br/>20. In this connection it is also to be noticed that on 9.1.61 the plaintiff deposited Rs. 5000.00 and it was prayed that the defendants may be directed to accept the money in terms of conditional petition of compromise. Then an order was pissed on 17.1.61 allowing the petitioner-plaintiffs to deposit the money under chalan No. 915. Thus it is clear that. die plaintiffs were always willing to pay up the debt of their father which was only to the extent of Rs. 5000.00 or so and they actually deposited the amount but still the Bank intended to go for the sale of the property which obviously shows that it was for an ulterior purpose.<br/><br/>21. In the result, therefore, this appeal is allowed. The suit is decreed and it is held that the sale in the Mortgage Execution case No. 37 of 1954 held on 10.11.54 has not affected the right, title, interest and possession of the plaintiffs. The defendants, however, will be at liberty to withdraw the amount of Taka 5000.00 which was deposited in court vide Order No. 33 dated 17.1.61 and the balance amount to be paid within 6 months from the date.<br/>There will be no order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
