The petitioner filed Other Class Suit No. 72 of 1986 in the Court of Assistant Judge, Basail, Tangail, for declaration that the <em>ex parte </em>judgment and decree dated 26th November, 1977 obtained in Other Class Suit No. 142 of 1977 by practicing fraud upon the Court by showing false report as to service of summons and on the basis of a forged karfa created in the name of a dead person. The plaintiff claimed the suit land by inheritance and possession thereon.<br/><br/>3. The defendant No.1 contested the suit by filing written statement denying the claim made in the plaint and claiming the suit land by purchase and that he filed the Other Class Suit No. 142 of 1977 for cor­recting the record of right, since in the record the name of one Azim Munshi was shown as owner-possessor of 3.82 acres of land mistakenly, asserting, amongst oth­ers, that the plaintiff has no right, title and interest in the suit property.<br/><br/>4. The plaintiff adduced three witnesses and the defendant adduced four witnesses in support of their respective cases. The plaintiff produced documents, proved and marked as exhibits 1-4 and the defendant produced documents, proved and marked as exhibits 'K' to 'b'. The learned Assistant Judge set aside the <em>ex parte</em> decree observ­ing that the suit property originally belonged to C.S. recorded owner Azim Munshi, that the service of the summons was not made in accordance with law, that the heirs of Azim Munshi including Majom Ali were residents of Asam, India, and therefore their address shown in the plaint in Bangladesh, on which the sum­mons were alleged to have been served by hanging, were found to be not true and that there was no service of summons as per Order 5 Rule 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/><br/>5. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judg­ment and order the defendant No.1 pre­ferred Other Class Appeal No. 22 of 2001 in the Court of District Judge, Tangail, which on transfer was heard and disposed of by the learned Joint District Judge, 4th Court, Tangail.<br/><br/>6. The learned Subordinate Judge allowed the appeal holding that since the suit as framed involved serious question of title, the plaintiff was required to seek conse­quential relief. The suit is not maintain­able and as such, the decree passed is ille­gal and void <em><img src="file:///C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image002.gif" style="height:16px; width:16px"/>ab initio</em> and that though the point of limitation was not agitated yet it is an obligation on the part of the Court to decide the point of limitation and as the suit was filed on 29th September, 1986 for setting aside the judgment and decree passed on 20th December, 1977, the suit was hopelessly barred by limitation. The learned Subordinate Judge also observed that though the process server through whom the service of summons was made, being dead, his signature was proved by his colleague process server, who deposed as P.W.4, and therefore, the service of summons was in accordance with law.<br/><br/>7. Being aggrieved, the plaintiff-petitioner moved the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.152 of 2005 and the High Court Division discharged the Rule. In this backdrop, petitioner moved this court in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1733 of 2008 and this court on consid­eration of the material on record dismissed the leave petition by the impugned judg­ment and order dated 30th July, 2009.<br/><br/>8. Mr. A. J. Mohammad Ali, the learned Counsel for the petitioner submits that it is the admitted position of the petitioner that he lives in Asham, and thus the date of knowledge of the petitioner is corroborat­ed by documentary evidence, such as, the petitioner's passport showing the date of his arrival in Bangladesh, and the certified copy of the <em>ex parte</em> decree obtained by him prior to filing the Other Class Suit No.72 of 1986. Furthermore, from the time of petitioner's arrival to Bangladesh and the date of filing the suit it is very much within the limitation period and therefore, there is error of law apparent on the face of the record which is required to be reviewed for the ends of justice. He fur­ther submits that this court failed to appre­ciate the facts and circumstances of the case that if the <em>ex parte</em> decree is set aside, the respondent No.1's heirs will not be left without any remedy rather, they would be able to contest the suit on merit, on the contrary, the petitioner is left without any remedy and as such, an opportunity should be given to the petitioner for the sake of complete justice to safeguard his constitu­tional right to property.<br/><br/>9. We have heard the learned Counsel and perused the record. These points were raised and decided by this court. There is no new ground for consideration.<br/>In the premises, we do not find any substance in the Review Petition.<br/>Accordingly, the Review Petition is dismissed.<br/>End.</div></div></div>
