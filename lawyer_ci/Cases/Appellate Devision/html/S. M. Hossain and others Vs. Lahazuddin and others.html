In the case of <em>Hajee Abdus S attar Vs. Mahiuddin and others </em>reported in<em> 6 BCR (AD)</em> 71 where it is held that the ten­ants are <em>estopped</em> from raising their title of adverse possession against the land lord. In the instant case it appears that the Title Suit No.96 of 1996 is barred by law since admittedly the plaintiff-respondents are tenants of the defendant-appellant. In the case reported in <em>20 BLD (AD) 278</em> the Appellate Division while discussing on the rejection of the plaint observed that-</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>"The plaintiffs therefore can not now be allowed to proceed with the pres­ent suit simply because that in the kabala of defendant No.1 certain explanations have been given for inclusion of certain lands. It appears that on fraud has been practiced upon the Court by the defendants in the ear­lier suit. The onus of proving their title and possession rest with the plaintiffs which they filed to dis­charge in their earlier suit even upto the Appellate Division. When this is the position the present suit can not be allowed to be proceeded further. As the ultimate result of the suit is as clear as day light such a suit should be properly buried at its inception so that no further time is consumed in a fruitless litigation. When the ultimate result is clear, the plaintiffs can not be allowed to re-open the same matter afresh after loosing upto the Appellate Division. This is merely a gambling in litigation which can not be allowed. The High Court Division thoroughly considered very aspect of the matter and rightly found that the present suit is barred by law."

Muzammel Hossain J. - </strong>This special appeal by leave is granted against the judgment and order dated 16.08.2000 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.1586 of 1998 discharging the Rule and affirming the order dated 23.03.1998 passed by the Sub-Ordinate Judge, 1st Court, Chittagong in Other Class Suit No.96 of 1996 rejecting the application of the instant petitioner under Order-7, Rule-11 (d) of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/><br/>2. Facts involved in this case, in short, are that the respondent Nos. 1-6 as plaintiffs instituted a suit on 25.08.1996 being Other Class Suit No.96 of 1996 in the 1st Court of Sub-Ordinate Judge, Chittagong praying for declaration that the plaintiff respondent Nos. 1-6 have acquired a title by adverse possession in the suit property and also prayed for confirmation of their possession and the respondents also prayed for other consequential relieves as mentioned in the plaint.<br/><br/>3. The case of the respondent Nos.1 to 6 in brief is that the schedule-2 property (which is    suit property) originally belonged to defendant No. 1 (Probhabati Chatterjee) that   Mohammed Yousuf, Predecessor of respondent Nos. 1 to 6 and <em><strong>Md. Muzammel Hossain J</strong></em> VII ADC (2010) their uncle Abdul Matin Chowdhury hired the suit building at a monthly rent of Tk.707- in the year 1947 from defendant No.1 that plaintiffs/respondent uncle left Chittagong in the year 1972 handing over possession of the suit premises in favour of plaintiffs/respondents father, that Md. Solaiman Chowdhury filed a rent suit against defendant No.1 being S.C.C. Suit No. 516 of 1953 and obtained an expert decree on 04.03.1954; that the suit proper­ty was sold in auction on 14.03.1955 in Money Execution Case No 343 of 1954; that the property was auction purchased by defendant No.2 the instant petitioner, who obtained Sale Certificate and took delivery of possession on 10.05.1955; that the auction sale was fraudulent, benami and null and void; that defendant opposite party No. 1 (Probhabati Chatterjee) started Miscellaneous Case No. 69 of 1956 under Order 21 rule<em> 90</em> in the 1st, Court of Munsif, Sadar Chittagong for setting aside the sale, which was dismissed on 23.11.1959 on contested hearing against which Miscellaneous Appeal No.1 of 1960 was preferred in the Court of learned District Judge, Chittagong, which was also dismissed on contested hearing that Civil Revision No. 1225 of 1960 was pre­ferred against the judgment and other passed in Miscellaneous Appeal No.1 of 1960; that the Rule was discharged on contested hearing on 21.07.1996 by this Honorable Court and the auction sale was confirmed; that the defendant No. 1 (Probhabati Chatterjee) also instituted other class suit No 21 of 1956 in the 1st Court of Munsif; that the said suit was renumbered as other suit No. 52 of 1957 in the Second Court of Munsif on transfer, was also dismissed on 02.06.1966; the appeal against said judgment was disal­lowed and that the S.A. No. 939 of 1967 was allowed by the Honorable High Court by Judgment dated 02.06.1983 and the suit was sent back on remand to the trial Court, which is said to be pending; that during pendency of the other class suit No.21 of 1956, plaintiffs/respondents father entered into a sale agreement for purchasing the suit property at a sum of Tk. 15,000/- executed by the Constituted Attorney of defendant No.1 on 22.05.1957 and a sum of Tk. 4000/- was paid to him as earnest money, that Md. Yousuf would continue to pay rent till Kabala is registered; that thereafter, plain­tiffs/respondents father paid a further sum of Tk. 11,000/- in two installments to the said Attorney leaving a balance of Tk. 1000/- that balance amount was refused by the attorney on tender by the plaintiffs/respondents father; that said Attorney also refused to execute the kabala on 07.01.1972; since then the plaintiffs/respondent Nos.1 to 6 are con­tinuing in adverse possession by asserting their own title; that the plaintiffs/respon­dents have acquired title by adverse pos­session. The instant petitioner filed two Rent Suits against the plaintiffs/respon­dents father and uncle numbered as money suit No.92 of 1960 and Money Suit No.97 of 1066 in the 1st, Court of Munsif; that both the suits ware stayed in Civil Revision No.1142 of 1969 preferred by plaintiffs/respondents father Md. Yousuf and their uncle Abdul Matin; that both the Civil Revision No. 1225 of 1960 and Civil Revision No 1142 of 1969 were heard analogously and both the Rules were dis­charged on 21.07.1996 on contested hear­ing; that the petitioner and respondent Nos.2-27 are threatening the plaintiffs/respondent Nos.1 to 6 with dis­possession and trying to dispossess them by force, hence the suit.<br/><br/>4. The petitioner appeared in the suit and filed a petition under order 7 rule 11 of the Civil Procedure Code for rejecting the plaint contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the plaintiffs/respondent Nos. 1 to 6 being legal heirs of temporary monthly co-tenant late Md. Yousuf and respondent Nos. 28-35 legal heirs of Abdul Matin also a co-tenant of the suit premises, stepped into the shoes of the original monthly tenants at a monthly rent of Tk. 70/- under original landlady Sm. Provabati Charterjee (said to be dead) and the petitioner having acquired the right, title and interest of said Provabati Chaterjee by auction purchase on 14.03.1955, the plaintiffs/respondents are estopped by law under section 115 and 116 of Evidence Act from setting up any claim of title and/or denying the petitioners title in the said property; that the claim of the plaintiffs/respondent Nos.1-6 was also barred by law; that the plaintiffs/ respondent Nos.1-6 has on cause of action for the suit; that the suit was under valued and proper Court fee was not paid; that the suit is also barred by the judgment passed in Civil Revision No. 1225/60 and Civil Revision No. 1142/69, in which the petitioners auction purchased right was finally adjudicated and decided by the Honorable High Court by judgment dated 21. 07.1996, heard analogously on contested hearing; that the suit was fraudulent, harassing and intended to con­tinue in unauthorised occupation of the suit premises by litigation without pay­ment of any rent to the petitioner; that the suit was misconceived and was also barred by section 66 of the Civil Procedure Code and the petitioner prayed for rejection of the plaint.<br/><br/>5. The plaintiff-respondent Nos.1-6 filed a written objection against the application for rejection of plaint stating,<em> inter-alia</em>, that the title of the petitioner was still sub-judice in Other Suit No.21 of 1956 filed by the respondent No.7 which does not contain any substance and legal force. It is asserted that the respondent No.7 died long ago and the suit filed by her has abat­ed. The petitioner referred the orders passed in Civil Revision No. 1225 of 1960 with regard to death of respondent No.7 at the time of hearing of the Rule. The respondent No.36 tadbirkar of the respon­dent No.7 was directed to produce respon­dent No.7 before the High Court Division by order dated 31.07.1989.<br/><br/>6. The learned Sub-Ordinate Judge by the judgment and order dated 23.03.1998 rejected the application under Order 7 Rule 11 C.P.C<br/><br/>7. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid order dated 23.03.1998 passed by the learned Sub-Ordinate Judge the petitioner pre­ferred revisional application being Civil Revision No. 1586 of 1998 before the High Court Division and obtained Rule which was discharged by the judgment and order dated 16.08.2000 and thereby affirming the order dated 23.03.1998 rejecting the application under Order 7 Rule 11 C.P.C.<br/><br/>8. The defendant No.2-petitioner being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and order  dated 16.08.2000 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division preferred these civil appeal and leave petitions before this Appellate Division.<br/><br/>9. This Hon'ble Court was pleased to grant leave in Civil Appeal No.178 of 2002 in the following terms<br/>"The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that there is a clear admission in the plaint that the predecessor-in-interest of the plain­tiff-respondent Nos.1 to 6 and respon­dent Nos.28 to 36 were monthly ten­ants in respect of the suit premises and the High Court Division has failed to take into consideration and thus acted illegally and erroneously. He further submits that the High Court Division acted illegally and contrary to law in failing to appreciate the law of estoppel of tenants as laid down in sections 115 and 116 of the Evidence Act under which monthly tenants are estopped from denying the title of the owner without surrender­ing the premises and the plaintiff-respondents admittedly not having surrendered possession after judg­ment in Civil Revision No. 1142 of 1969 wherein the issue of tenancy has been decided, the suit is barred by law.<br/>The learned counsel further submits that the High Court Division acted illegally and contrary to law in failing to consider that the plaintiffs' suit was barred by Sections 11 and 66 of the Civil Procedure Code and as such committed error in law in rejecting the petition under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. He further submits that the plaintiff-respondents being heirs of the deceased defendants in Money Suit Nos. 92 of 1960 and 97 of 1966 filed by the defendant for recovery of arrear rent and the predecessor-in-interest having admitted their tenancy under the petitioner in respect of the same property, the High Court Division erred in law in not holding that the present suit claiming title by heirs of tenant is barred under Order XXII, Rule 4, Sub-Rule (2) of the Civil Procedure Code whereunder the heirs are estopped from raising a new case. The above submissions merit consid­eration. Leave is granted upon condonation of the delay."<br/><br/>10. Hassan Ariff, the learned Advocate appearing for the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 178 of 2002 and respon­dent No.1 in Civil Petition Nos. 94-95 of 2005 sub­mits that in view of the clear admission in the plaint that the predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiff-respondent Nos. 1 to 6 and respondent Nos. 28-36 were monthly tenants in respect of the suit premises and the High Court Division committed error in law in taking into consideration the same view. He then submits that the High Court Division acted illegally and con­trary to law in failing to appreciate the law of <em>estoppel</em> of tenants are laid down in Sections 115 and 116 of the Evidence Act under which monthly tenants are estopped from denying the title of the owner with­out surrendering the premises and the plaintiff-respondents admittedly not hav­ing surrendered possession after judgment in Civil Revision No. 1142 of 1969 where­in the issue of tenancy has been decided, the suit is barred by law. In support of his contention he has referred to the decisions reported in <em><strong>BCR 1986 AD 71; 1986 BLD (AD) 224(a); 48 DLR (AD) 205</strong></em>. Mr. Ariff submits that the High Court Division acted illegally in failing to consider that the plaintiffs' suit was barred by Sections 11 and 66 of the Civil Procedure Code and thus committed error of law in rejecting the application under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code. He has referred to the decision of the case of <em><strong>Guiness Peat (Trading) Limited Vs. Md. Fazlur Rahman </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> 12 BLD (AD) 247.</strong></em> He finally submits that the plaintiff-respondents being heirs of the deceased defendants in Money Suit Nos.92 of 1960 and 97 of 1966 filed by the defendants for recovery of arrear rent and the predecessor-in-interst having admitted their tenancy under the petition­er in respect of the same property, the High Court Division erred in law in not holding that the present suit claiming title by heirs of tenant is barred under Order XXII, Rule 4, Sub-Rule (2) of the Civil Procedure Code and as such they are estopped from raising any new case.<br/><br/>11. In this context he refers to the case of <em><strong>Abdul Jalil and others Vs. Islamic Bank Bangladesh Ltd. </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> 20 BLD (AD) 278.</strong></em><br/><br/>12. Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan, the learned Senior Advocate appearing for the respondents submits that there is no ille­gality in the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division. In view of the findings of the Court that the plaintiffs were their predecessors were not the tenants under the defendant-petitioner. He then submits that the High Court Division rightly found that without taking evidence and without considering the materials on record under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure can not be rejected. He then submits that the High Court Division rightly held that the plain­tiffs the plaintiffs predecessor-in-interest one Md. Yousuf was a monthly tenant of Provabati Chattarjee who appointed one Shaieswar Bhattacharjee as constituted Attorney in respect of the suit property. Md. Yousuf was a tenant under Provabati Chattarjee in the year 1956 the said Shaileswar Bhattacharjee being constituted attorney of Provabati Chattarjee entered into an agreement for sale of the suit property with Md. Yousuf and after his death his heirs namely the present plaintiffs have been possessing the suit property all through and as such the plaint is not barred by any provision of Order 7, Rule 11. He then submits that the High Court Division rightly held that from the plaint itself it was found that one Salaiman Chowdhury who claimed to be land Lord sold the suit property in auction for arrear of rents and in such auction sale the defendant No.1-S.M. Hossain purchased the suit property and against such auction sale the said Provabati Chatterjee through her constituted attorney Shaileswar Bhattacharjee instituted a suit for setting aside the exparte decree and that proceeding is still pending before another Court for disposal and the same is now <em>sub-judice</em> in Other Sit Nos. 21 of 1956 and 52 of 1957 and as such the High Court Division committed no error of law discharging the Rule and affirming the order of the learned Sub-Ordinate Judge,1<sup>st</sup> Court, Chittagong.  Referring to the decision reported in <em><strong>11 MLR (AD) 58 </strong></em>Mr. Bhuiyan submits that the rejection of plaint on ground of maintainability of the suit is not permissible before filing of written state­ment. He then refers to the decision of <em><strong>Abdul Jalil Miah (Md) Vs. Niropama Ritchil and others </strong></em>reported in <em><strong>49 DLR (AD) 61 at page 63, paragraph No.9 </strong></em>and submits that the plaintiff having been inducted in the suit property as tenant he cannot claim title by adverse possession which implies that it had commenced in wrong and is maintained against right and as such in the instant case the High Court Division rightly rejected the application for rejection of plaint under Order 7, Rule 11 of the C.P.C. as the plaintiff as the plaintiff in the instant suit land was not asserting his adverse possession rather he entered into the suit land as tenant so he is predecessor-in-interest. He then submits that the plaint is liable to be rejected being barred by law must be apparent from the statement made in the plaint itself and not from the written statement or any other material other than that has been put in the plaint. He then submits that both the Courts below rightly found that the plaint does not disclose any statement to be barred by any law. In support of his con­tention he has cited to the decision of the case of <em><strong>Abdul Malek Sawdagar Vs  Md. Mahbubey Alam and others </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> 57 DLR(AD) 18</strong></em> and <em><strong>Santipada Datta &amp; oth­ers Vs Satish Chandra Das and others </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> 54 DLR (AD)173 at page 175, paragraph Nos.9-11.</strong></em><br/><br/>13. We have heard the learned Counsels of both sides, perused the judgment and order passed by the trial Court, the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division and other con­nected papers on record. On perusal of the plaint it appears that admittedly the prede­cessor of plaintiff-respondent Nos.1-6-Provabati Chatterjee, Mohammed Yousuf and their uncle Abdul Matin Chowdhury rented the suit building at a monthly rent of Tk.70/- in the year 1947 from defendant No. 1-respondent No.7 (Provabati Chatterjee) was the owner of the suit prop­erty. One Md. Solaiman Chowdhury claiming to be the owner of the suit land got an <em>ex parte</em> decree in S.C.C. Suit No.516 of 1993 against the defendant No.1 Provabati Chatterjee and the suit property was sold in auction in Money Execution Case No.343 of 1954 to the defendant No.2-appellant. The defendant respondent No.7-Provabati Chatterjee filed Miscellaneous Case No.69 of 1956 for setting aside the auction sale but the case was dismissed against which Miscellaneous Appeal No.1 of 1960 was preferred which was also dismissed. Thereafter the respondent No.7 preferred Civil Revision No. 1225 of 1960 in which the Rule was discharged and the auction sale was affirmed. Thereafter the respondent No.7 filed Other Class Suit No.21 of 1956 renumbered as No.52 of 1957 which was dismissed and subsequently he pre­ferred an appeal against the judgment and order of dismissal which was also disal­lowed and the First Appeal No.939 of 1967 filed before the High Court Division was allowed and ultimately the suit No.52 of 1957 was sent back on remand to the trial Court. During the pendency of the aforesaid suit plaintiffs further entered into a sale agreement for purchasing the suit land through the constituted attorney of defendant No.1 and subsequently the attorney refused to execute the <em>kabala</em> on 07.01.1972 and since then the plaintiff-respondent Nos.1-6 are continuing in their adverse possession by asserting their own title. The defendant No.2-appellant filed two rent suits against the father of plaintiff No.1 respondent No.6 being Money Suit Nos.92 of 1960 and 97 of 1966 and against these two suits Civil Revision Nos.1225 of 1960 and 1142 of 1969 were preferred respectively and both these two revisions were heard analogously and Rules were discharged. Thereafter the respondent Nos.7-27 threatening with the respondent No.1-6 with their possession. The plaintiff-respondent Nos.1-6 institut­ed Other Class Suit No.96 of 1996 in the 1st Court of Subordinate Judge, Chittagong for a declaration that the plain­tiff-respondent Nos.1-6 had title by adverse possession in the suit property, for confirmation of their possession and for their consequential relief.<br/><br/>14. So it appears that the defendant-appel­lant is very much land lord of the plaintiff-respondent Nos.1-6. On the facts stated in the plaint it appears that the plaintiff-respondent Nos.1-6 are the tenant under the defendant No.2-appellant claiming to be the owner of the suit land having obtained decree in the S.C.C. Suit No.516 of 1993 and the defendant No.2-appellant purchased the suit land in auction in Money Execution Case No.343 of 1954 and the appeal filed by the respondent No.7 was also dismissed and C.R. Case No. 1225 of 1960 in which the Rule was discharged by the High Court Division and thereby trial Courts order was affirmed and confirmed the auction sale. So admit­tedly the defendant-appellant being owner of the suit land is the land lord of the plaintiffs. It is also appears that through a constituted attorney of defendant No.1 subsequently the plaintiff respondent Nos.1-6 entered into an agreement for sale for purchasing the suit land during the pendency of the Suit No.21 of 1956 but the constituted attorney refused to execute the kabala on 07.01.1972 and since then the plaintiff-respondent Nos.1-6 are con­tinuing in their adverse possession by asserting their title. This is the assertion of the plaintiff that they having acquired title by adverse possession though admittedly they are predecessor entered into the suit land as tenant and status of the tenancy is very much <em>sub-judice</em> in the Other Sui No.21 of 1956. The estoppel as describe in this section is known as tenant's estoppel or <em>estoppel</em> by contract. In the case of <em><strong>Hajee Abdus Sattar Vs. Mahiuddin &amp; ors </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> 38 DLR (AD) 97 </strong></em>where the Appellate Division held that "when a person enters into possession of immovable property as a tenant of another person there neither he nor anybody claiming throng him shall be permitted during the continu­ance of the tenancy to deny the landlord’s title however defective that title might be. This necessarily implies that in case the tenant sets up a claim of title in himself he shall first surrender possession to the per­son from whom he had taken it". The Appellate Division in the case of Haji Kasimuddin Mandal being dead his heirs <em><strong>Afroza Bewa and others Vs Md. Jalaluddin Pramanik reported in 48 DLR (AD) 205</strong></em> retreating the same principle holding that "A tenant cannot set up title to a property of which he is a monthly tenant without surrendering possession to his landlord."<br/><br/>15. In the instant case from the plain read­ing of the plaint it appears that the plain­tiff-respondent Nos.1-6 are admittedly inducted into the suit land as tenant but with the subsequent facts of entering into a contact of agreement for sale with the constituted attorney of the land lord who subsequently refused to execute the deed of sale would not take the tenant plaintiff-respondent Nos.1-6 owner of the suit property by adverse possession. In such a case plaintiff-respondent Nos.1-6 would be estopped from raising the plea of adverse possession as we have already noticed from the aforesaid decisions.<br/><br/>16. Under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure a plaint may be rejected on a plain reading of the plaint. But in an appropriate case,  while the proceeding itself is an abuse of the process of the Court, the Court having recourse  of Section 151 will be competent to reject the plaint or strike out part of the relief prayed for. In the case of <em><strong>Abdul Jalil and others Vs. Islamic Bank Bangladesh Ltd. </strong></em>report­ed in<em><strong> 20 BLD (AD) 278 </strong></em>and the case of<em><strong> Rasheda Begum Vs. M.M. Nurussafa and others </strong></em>reported in <em><strong>24 BLD (AD) 223 </strong></em>the Appellate Division decided to the same effect.<br/><br/>17.  In the instant case it appears that the plaint of the plaintiff-respondent's suit be rejected even under the inherent power of the Court under Section 116 of the Code since the plaintiff is <em>estopped </em>to claim from his adverse possession against the defendant-appellant before us.<br/><br/>18. We have already discussed above that during the pendency of Title Suit No.52 of 1957 and also in view of the Civil Revision No. 1225 of 1960 and Civil Revision No. 1142 of 1969 the status of the plaintiff respondent Nos.1-6 there is a <em>prima facie</em> case that the plaintiff respon­dent Nos.1-6 are the tenants under the defendant-appellant or his predecessor-in-interest. In the case of <em><strong>Hajee Abdus S attar Vs. Mahiuddin and others </strong></em>reported in<em><strong> 6 BCR (AD)</strong></em> 71 where it is held that the ten­ants are <em>estopped</em> from raising their title of adverse possession against the land lord. In the instant case it appears that the Title Suit No.96 of 1996 is barred by law since admittedly the plaintiff-respondents are tenants of the defendant-appellant. In the case reported in <em><strong>20 BLD (AD) 278</strong></em> the Appellate Division while discussing on the rejection of the plaint observed that-<br/>"The plaintiffs therefore can not now be allowed to proceed with the pres­ent suit simply because that in the kabala of defendant No.1 certain explanations have been given for inclusion of certain lands. It appears that on fraud has been practiced upon the Court by the defendants in the ear­lier suit. The onus of proving their title and possession rest with the plaintiffs which they filed to dis­charge in their earlier suit even upto the Appellate Division. When this is the position the present suit can not be allowed to be proceeded further. As the ultimate result of the suit is as clear as day light such a suit should be properly buried at its inception so that no further time is consumed in a fruitless litigation. When the ultimate result is clear, the plaintiffs can not be allowed to re-open the same matter afresh after loosing upto the Appellate Division. This is merely a gambling in litigation which can not be allowed. The High Court Division thoroughly considered very aspect of the matter and rightly found that the present suit is barred by law."<br/><br/>19. From the above discussions and find­ings we are of the view that the High Court Division committed an error of law in discharging the Rule. As we have already observed that a plaint may be rejected under Order 7, Rule 11 from the plain reading of the plaint. But in excep­tional cases a plaint may also be rejected under inherent power of the Court under Section 151 of the Code when the suit is barred by law as in the instant case. For the aforesaid reasons we find merit in the appeal.<br/><br/>20. In the result, the appeal is allowed without any order as to cost. The impugned judgment   and order dated 16.08.2000 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.1586 of 1998 is hereby set aside. The application under Order 7, Rule 11 is allowed rejection of the plaint of the plain­tiff.<br/>Accordingly, the Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos. 94-95 of 2005 are also disposed of in terms of the judgment in this civil appeal.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
