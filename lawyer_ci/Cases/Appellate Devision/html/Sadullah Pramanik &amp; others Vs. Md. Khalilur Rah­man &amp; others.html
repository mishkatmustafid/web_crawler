Defendants are the appellants Plaintiff respondent filed Title Suit No. 66 of 1966 in the Court of Munsif, 2nd Court, Serajganj for declaration of title and recovery of possession. His case was that the suit land described in the schedule ‘Ka’ and ‘Kha’ of the plaint appertaining to Khatian Nos. 123 and 125 respec­tively of mouza Bhangari originally belonged to landlords Girija Sannyal and Aswini Kumar Sannyal. Bassarat Akanda and Maidan Akanda used to cultivate the suit land in raiyati right as tenants paying half of the produce as rent. Maidan Akanda surrendered his land in favour of the landlords who in turn gave that land in borga to Bassarat Akanda. Bassarat Akanda died leaving two sons namely Mofiz Akanda and Mahim Akanda who by inheritance got the land of Khatian No. 123 of Schedule 'Ka' as raiyati tenant at a rental of half of the produce and also possessed the land of Khatian No. 125 of Schedule ‘Kha’ in borga like their father. Having difficulties in paying rent in crop Mafiz and Mahim prayed to the landlords for conversion of Khatian No. 123 into money rent and further prayed for leasing out the land of Khatian 125 to them by fixing a jama. Narayan Chandra Roy, Manager of the Estate leased out 3.91 acres of land of Khatian Nos. 123 and 125 to the plaintiff Mofiz and Mohim at a rental of Rs. 15/8/- annas on 15<sup>th</sup> Chaitra, 1348 B.S. after receiv­ing Nazarana and issued a Likhon in favour of Mahim and Mofiz who had been possess­ing the land as tenant on payment of rent to the Sanayal landlords. The present provisio­nal rent Roll Khatian has been finally pub­lished in the name of Mahim and Mofiz who have sold two plots out of their jote to the plaintiffs by registered kabala dated 28.1.65. His further case was that the defendants cut and took away jute grown by the plaintiffs for which the criminal case was started but the case was dismissed and being encouraged by an order of acquittal the defendants dis­possessed the plaintiffs from the suit land on 11.6.66.<br/><br/>3. The suit was resisted by the defendants who contended that Basarat Akanda and Maidan Akanda had no raiyati right in the suit land. Both of them were simple bargadars under the landlords namely Sannyals. Mohim and Mofiz never possessed the land in raiyati right. Therefore the plain­tiff's purchase of the suit land from Mofiz and Mohim did not confer any title on the plaintiff. Defendants, it was contended, were in possession and took pattan of the suit land by Amalnama. The trial Court on consideration of the evidence decreed the suit. Appellate Court, however, reversed the decision and allowed the appeal and found that the defendants are in possession by making reservation as under:<br/>"The PRR in my opinion has been correctly recorded in the names of Sannyals because they did not lease out to either party. It is their khas land. Neither plaintiff's vendor nor de­fendants was able to record their names in the PRR and they could not do so as they actually had no title and pos­session for the purpose of recording their names, defendants are found to be in possession, not known in what capacity".<br/>In that view of the matter the appeal was allowed. In Second Appeal the High Court Division on analysis of the evidence found that the plaintiff had proved the tenancy right of Mofiz and Mohim and their settle­ment by Ext. 3. This Ext. was not considered by the Court of appeal below in correct per­spective. Ext. 3 Likhon was issued in 1348 B.S. for the lease of the land of both the Khatians. Appellate Court below considered that there was no corroborative evidence and accordingly disbelieved this Likhon. The High Court Division rightly pointed that there was positive evidence of P.W. 3 to substan­tiate the genuineness of the Ext. 3. It is found to be genuine as it has been found by the trial court, the High Court Divi­sion inferred that the suit was filed within 12 years from 1363   B.S. and the same was not barred by limitation. Next the kabala Ext, 1 of the plaintiff had been admitted by both P. Ws. Mofiz and Mohim. It is clear that the lower appellate court below wrongly set aside the judgment of the Munsif inas­much as plaintiff’s title has been amply proved by the oral evidence as well whereas the appellate Court below had found the possession in favour of the defendant by saying "not known, what capacity".  When a dispute is brought before the Court for adjudication, it is necessary for the Court to come to conclusion this way or the other. The defendants have got no document of title. This was noticed by the appellate Court below as well. The defendants relied on an Amalnama Ext. C and C (1) and even the appellate Court below compared the sig­nature of Aswin Sannayal on Ext. C series with dakhilas Ext. D series and found that Ext. C series were not genuine. Notwith­standing this finding that the defendant had got no document of title yet the judgment and decree of the trial court was set aside.<br/>Mr. Pal appearing for the plaintiff res­pondents canvassed that the appellate Court below had reversed the decision of the trial court on misreading and disreading the posi­tive evidence on record.<br/><br/>4. Mr. B.N. Chowdhury appearing for the defendant-appellant contended that the plaintiffs' vendors were mere borgadar and their tenancy could not be proved. The position of the defendants is worse. In the Khatian it is mentioned that the right of Sannyal was ga¨¯eZ¡ wPi¯’vqx (illegible) and as such a lease holder under them would be tenant. But strangely enough in the Amalnama of the defendants Ext. C series, it shows that Korfa pattan. The trial Court concluded that the contention of the plaintiff that these were created after the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act when the Sannayal became raiyat by operation of law and on a mistaken notion thought that no lease could be granted to them and therefore korfa pattan was mentioned. This position shows that Ext. C series were created for the purpose of the suit the inference drawn from such document is a question of law and there is no escape from the conclusion that the trial court was correct in drawing the conclusion as it did. Now the question of status of the plaintiff's vendor. In the case of <strong><em>Abu Nasser Sayedullah Vs. Abdul Malik alias Mala and another 12 DLR 206</em></strong> a single Bench consi­dered section 3(17) proviso and held that a borgadar could become a tenant before the introduction of the provisio to clause (17) of section 3 but cannot be so after its introduc­tion unless the conditions in the exception are fulfilled. The decision was doubted in <strong><em>14 DLR 801</em></strong> in the case of <strong><em>Munir Mondal and others Vs. Paramatha Nath Chowdhury and others</em></strong> by a Division Bench and it was held that borgadar recorded in C.S. Khatian as tenant before introduction of the provision in 1928, can plead tenancy right after the introduction of the proviso. It was observed that the interpretation given in <strong><em>12 DLR</em></strong> would create anomalous position namely once a tenant, he could not be considered as tenant for the subsequent period. Reliance was placed on high authority, <strong><em>A.I.R. 1940 P.C. 124</em></strong> that such a construction so unreasonable and impractical ought not to have been preferred when another construction is open. Subse­quently, in the case of <strong><em>Krishna Chandra Paul Vs. Khoyar Sardar, 20 DLR 746</em></strong> another Single Bench took the view that a person who is holding land by giving a share of the crop must be doing so under the system known as Borga, Adhi or Bhag and, if the C.S. record show that before the amend­ment in 1928 the person was holding the land as a permanent raiyati and the rent was fixed at half the crop and that cess is included in the rent which has been fixed, then it must be held that the person was not holding the land under the system of Borga, or adhi but he was a tenant with occupancy right and the rent was fixed by which the cess was also included.<br/><br/>5. Proviso to section 3(17) may now be considered. It reads:<br/>"Provided that a person who, under the system generally khown as "Adhi", Borga" or "Bhag" cultivates the land of another person on condition of delivering a share of the produce to that per­son, is not a tenant, unless—<br/>(i) such person has been expressly admitteed to be a tenant by his landlord in any document executed by him or executed in his favour and accepted by him; or<br/>(ii) He has been or is held by a Civil Court to be a tenant."<br/><br/>6. Having considered these three decisions the opinion is that the <strong><em>14 DLR 801</em></strong> had correctly interpreted the law which was reiterated in <strong><em>20 DLR 746</em></strong> and in that view of the matter there is no hesitation in saying that the plain­tiffs' vendor was tenant of the landlords Sannyals and Ext. 3 is such document backed by Ext. 4 series and evidence of P. W.3. The plaintiff has filed the dakhilas Ext. 4 series and P. W.3 Narayan Chandra Roy admitted that these dakhilas were written by Provash Chandra who was the Tahsildar of the Estate. The Appellate Court below had discarded these evidence without any reason. Next, on the possession, the appellate court below took the view that the defendant's possession had bee proved. Mr. Pal has placed the evidence P. W.5 on whom the appellate court relied for coming to its conclusion. On scrutiny, it is found that the appellate Court had misread the evidence and no inference could be drawn as it did for finding possession of the defendant. Plaintiff purchased it by registered kabala from his vendors who were the tenants, therefore his title was rightly declared by the trial Court and the High Court Division took the correct view that the appellate Court below had drawn erroneous inference from the evidence and rightly set aside the judg­ment of the appellate Court below and restor­ed the trial court's decision.<br/><br/>In the result therefore this appeal is dismi­ssed with costs.                 <br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
