Joynul Abedin J.-</strong> This petition for leave to appeal at the instance of the defendant is directed against the judgment and order dated 10.3.2008 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 1079 of 2008 reject­ing the revisional application summarily affirming the judgment and decree dated 31.1.2004 passed by the Joint District Judge, 1st Court, Manikgonj in title Appeal No.133 of 2002 and also the judgment and decree dated 29.4.2002 passed by the learned Assistant Judge, Manikganj decreeing the suit in Title Suit No.128 of 2000.<br/><br/>2. The respondent as plaintiff instituted Title No.128 of 2000 in the court of the Assistant Judge, Manikganj against the defendant petitioner praying for a decree for permanent injection restraining the defendant petitioner from dispossessing him from the suit land claiming the suit land on the basis of a deed of exchange dated 22.8.1988 and also the exclusive possession therein.<br/><br/>3. The defendant petitioner contested the suit by filing written statement contend­ing, inter alia, that the plaintiff did not get the suit land on the basis of any deed of exchange and that the defendant was not aware of Title Suit No.317 of 1973, did not receive any summons of the said suit, did not know about the mutation of the plaintiffs name on the basis of the decree passed in the said suit. The defendant alleged that he has title and possession in the suit land and prayed dismissal of the suit.<br/><br/>4. The learned Assistant Judge decreed the suit on contest by the judgment and decree dated 29.4.2002 on the finding that the plaintiff proved his prima facie title and exclusive possession in the suit land. Against the aforesaid judgment and decree the defendant preferred Title Appeal No. 133 of 2002 before the learned District Judge, Manikganj, which was heard on transfer by the  learned Joint District Judge, 1st Court, Manikganj, who by the impugned judgment  and  decree dated 31.1.2004   dismissed   the   appeal   and affirmed the judgment and decree passed by the trial court.<br/><br/>5.  Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the aforesaid judgment and decree the defendant moved the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.1079 of 2008. A Single Bench of the High Court Division after hearing rejected the application sum­marily on the finding that the plaintiff by the evidence on record succeeded in prov­ing his title and possession in the suit land and the courts below did not commit any illegality in appreciating the evidence on record and that the question of identifica­tion of the suit land having not been raised in the courts below merited no considera­tion at the revisional stage. Hence this civil petition for leave to appeal by the petitioner.<br/><br/>6. Mr. Md. Aftab Hossain, the learned Advocate-on-record for the petitioner sub­mits that the Single Bench of the High Court Division overlooked that the deed dated 22.8.1988 does not correspondent to the land mentioned in the schedule of Title Suit No. 317 of 1973 and as such the plaintiff did not acquire any title in the suit land despite the <em>ex parte</em> decree in his favour in the said suit. He lastly submits that all the courts below including the High Court Division erred in failing to consider that the plaintiff failed to specifi­cally identity the suit land as set out in the schedule to the plaint and as such there has been a failure of justice warranting interference by this Court.<br/><br/>7. We have heard the learned Advocate-on-Record and perused the connected papers including the impugned judgment. We do not find any substance in the points raised. The High Court Division upon consideration of all the points raised and argued on behalf of the defendant arrived at a correct decision on the basis of the materials on record. We therefore find no reason to interfere with the same.<br/><br/>The petition is accordingly dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
