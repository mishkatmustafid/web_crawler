Joynul Abedin J.-</strong>This petition for leave to appeal by the plaintiff is directed against the judgment and order dated 2.3.2008 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Order No.1010 of 2008 discharging the rule affirming the judgment and decree dated 21.1.2008 and 7.9.2003 respectively passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Pabna, First Court, in Title Appeal No.256 of 2003 and the First Court of the Joint District Judge (the then Subordinate Judge), Pabna in Title Suit No.26 of 1995 dismissing the suit on the ground that "বাদীর মোকদ্দমা রক্ষনীয় নয় হেতু বাদীর আরজী এতদ্বারা নাকচ হয়।"<br/><br/>2. The petitioner as plaintiff instituted Title Suit No.26 of 1995 in the 1st Court of the Joint District Judge, Pabna for declaration of title in the suit land on the averments, <em>inter alia,</em> that the suit land originally belonged to one Zinnat Ali, grand father of the plaintiff. With the consent of the said Zinnat Ali plaintiffs mother Taklima Khatun constructed three-storied building in the suit land between 1969-1979 and the plaintiff with his father and mother has been residing therein. The said Zinnat Ali died leaving one widow, Hasimunnessa and two sons Jalal Uddin and Akkas Ali and thereafter Hasimunnessa died leaving the said two sons. The said Akkas Ali by registered kabala deed dated 13.12.1977 transferred his share in favour of Taklima Khatun (mother of the plaintiff) and on 12.3.1981 by a registered Hebanama Jalal Uddin transferred his share to his wife Taklima Khatun and in this way Taklima Khatun inherited the suit land and mutated her name and also paid government rent etc. Jalal Uddin died on 3.2.1992 and Taklima Khatun died on 18.12.1993 leaving her only son, the plaintiff and the plaintiff has been in possession of the suit land by inheritance. To grab the suit land, respondent created false loan case vide Loan Case No.HB-PAB-38(Multi) dated 25.11.1981 and started Miscellaneous Case No.43 of 1984 (H.B.) under the provision of President's Order No.27 of 1973 and on 26.6.1994 beyond the knowledge of the plaintiff petitioner obtained decree. Hence the title of the plaintiff petitioner in the suit land was clouded and hence the suit was filed.<br/><br/>3. The defendant-respondent contested the suit by filing written statement denying the material allegations made in the plaint to the effect that "বাদীর পিতা জালাল উদ্দিন খাঁ তাহার স্বত্ত দখলীয় ভুমির উপর ত্রিতল ইমারত নির্মানের অভিপ্রায়ে বাংলাদেশ হাউস বিল্ডিং ফাইনান্স  করপোরেশন রিজিনাল অফিস পাবনায় ঋণের আবেদন করিলে মামলাটি পাব ৩৮ নং ঋন কেস মুলে ও রেজিস্ট্রিকৃত মর্টগেজ দলিল মুলে ৩,২৭০০০/- টাকা ঋন মঞ্জুর এবং উক্ত ঋণের টাকা দ্বারা জালাল উদ্দিন খাঁ জেলা ও থানা পাবনা মৌজা দক্ষিণ রাঘবপুর সি,এস, খতিয়ান ৪৭১,৪৭৬ এস,এ খং নং-৪২৪,৪২৭ সি,এস, ও এস,এ দাগ ২২৩,২২৪ জমির পরিমান .০৪১৯ ডেসিমেল ভুমির উপর একটি ত্রিতল বাড়ি নির্মান করেন। পরবর্তীকালে জালাল ঊদ্দিন খাঁ কিস্তি পরিশোধ করিতে ব্যর্থ হইলে বিজ্ঞ জেলা জজ আদালতে তাহার বিরুদ্ধে ঋণের সূদে আসলে ৩,৮৮,৪০৬/৭২ টাকা আদায়ের জন্য মিস ৪৩/৮৪ মোকদ্দমা দায়ের করা হয় ।"<br/>It is further contended that the said case was allowed on 1.4.1987 and execution case being Decree Jari Case No.9 of 1988 was started which is now pending in the Artha Rin Adalat, Pabna, hence the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>4. The plaintiff petitioner thereafter filed an application under Order 11, Rule 14 read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure for production of certain documents    mentioned in the written statement. The learned Joint District Judge, 1st Court, Faridpur, thereafter on hearing both the parties by order dated 10.3.1998 directed    the defendant respondent to produce the documents but the defendant respondent   failed to do so. Hence the plaintiff petitioner filed an application under Order 11, Rule 21 to strike out the defence of the defendant respondent which was allowed by order dated 10.8.2002 and 16.9.2002 was fixed for peremptory hearing. But the trial court suddenly by order dated 7.9.2003 dismissed the suit as not maintainable.<br/><br/>5. Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the aforesaid order dated 7.9.2003 the plaintiff petitioner preferred Title Appeal No.256 of 2003 which was subsequently transferred to the First Court of Additional District Judge, Pabna who after hearing affirmed the order dated 7.9.2003 and dismissed the appeal. Thereafter being    dissatisfied with the aforesaid judgment and order the plaintiff petitioner moved the High Court Division in Civil Order No. 3796 of 2007. A Division Bench of the High Court Division after hearing rejected the application summarily by impugned judgment and order dated 2.3.2008.<br/><br/>6. In this backdrop, the petitioner filed civil petition for leave to appeal.<br/><br/>7. Mr. S.N. Goswami, the learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that the learned Judges of the High Court Division erred in law in not considering the facts and circumstances of the case that the trial court framed the issues on 18.9.1997 and subsequently the suit was posted for peremtory hearing but the suit was <em>Suo Moto </em>withdrawn from the peremtory hearing without giving effect to the applications under Order 11 Rule 14 and Order 11 Rule 21 of the Code of Civil Procedure filed by the plaintiff petitioner and also without considering the Order dated 10.8.2002 wherein it is noted “বিবাদী পক্ষ আদেশ থাকা স্বত্তেও কাগজ পত্র দাখিল করেন নাই। বাদী পক্ষ আইন মোতাবেক Benefit পাইবেন।" the learned Courts below committed error of law in passing the impugned judgment which is against the principle of natural justice and as such the same is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>8. We have heard the learned Advocate for the petitioner and perused the connected papers including the impugned judgment. We do not find any substance in the points   raised. The High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision. We therefore find no reason to interfere with the same.<br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
