After his death, his widow and son, while in possession of the suit land transferred the same to Rajib and his wife Sumoti Bala by a kabala regis­tered on 27.10.1952 and also to Suraja Kumar by kabalas dated 24.10.1972 and 10.09.1974 and also duly delivered pos­session of the transferred land in their favour.

There is a delay of 14 (fourteen) days in filing this petition. The delay is condoned.<br/><br/>3. The facts leading to the filing of this petition, in brief, are that this petitioner filed a suit being the Partition Suit No.25 of 1999 in the Court of Joint District Judge, Patiya, against the respondent Nos.1 to 8, praying for a decree for parti­tion of the property mentioned in the schedule to the plaint.<br/><br/>4. The case of the plaintiff, in brief, are that admittedly the  land described in schedule-I to the plaint belonged to Nolini Kumar Dey and the land described in Schedule-II belonged to Jogendra Lal in <em>raiyati </em>right. Nolini sold the lands described in schedule-I to Moni Bala Dey by a <em>kabala</em> dated 20.06.1947 while Jogendra Lal sold in total 0.09 acres of land to Moni Baloa by another registered kabala dated 22.05.1947. Jogendra Lal sold the remaining 0.08 acres of land to Rani Bala, the defendant No.1. Moni Bala being the owner of the said 0.09 acres of land by purchase and in possession, trans­ferred the same in favour of the plaintiff by a registered kabala dated 04.02.1970 and  also  delivered  possession  in her favour. In late 1988, she went to the land to erect a house thereon but the son of the defendant No.1 disclosed that the name of his parents had been recorded in the B.S. <em>Khatain</em>. Since the plaintiff and the defen­dant Nos.1 and 2 are in <em>ejmali</em> possession of the suit land she requested them to par­tition the property by meats and bounds but without any response, as such, was constrained to file the suit on 27.05.1999. The present petitioner, however, was added as the plaintiff No.2 by an order dated 26.06.2001.<br/><br/>5. The suit was contested by the defendant Nos.1 and 2 by filing a written statement, contending,<em> inter alia</em>, that the admitted owner of the properties described in schedule-I to the plaint was Nolini. He out of fear of Mohajan transferred his proper­ty in favour of Moni Bala Dey, his relative and the sister-in-law of Jogendra by a reg­istered kabala dated 19.03.1947 but as a matter of fact it was a mere sham transac­tion because Nolini did neither receive any consideration from Moni Bala nor delivered possession of the concerned land in her favour. After his death, his widow and son, while in possession of the suit land transferred the same to Rajib and his wife Sumoti Bala by a kabala regis­tered on 27.10.1952 and also to Suraja Kumar by kabalas dated 24.10.1972 and 10.09.1974 and also duly delivered pos­session of the transferred land in their favour. The B.S. Khatian was also cor­rectly prepared in the name of Surja Kumar and his wife Suniti Bala. After their death, the defendant No.2 became owner of the suit land. The admitted owner of the properties mentioned in schedule-II to the plaint was Jogendra Lal. He transferred 0.08 acre of land in R.S. Plot No.2319 in favour of the defendant No.1 by a kabala registered on 31.03.1967. After his death, his widow transferred the rest of the land in favour of the defendant No. 1 by a kabala registered on 16.07.1970. In this manner, the defen­dant No.1 became the owner of the entire suit land. Thereafter, he by a kabala regis­tered on 24.10.1972, transferred the suit land to Surja Kumar, the father of the defendant No.2 and he is in possession of the same.<br/><br/>6. The trial Court by its judgment and decree dated 16.10.2003 found that the <em>kabalas</em> executed registered by Nolini and Jogendra in favour of Moni Bala in 1947 were never acted upon and so also those in favour of the plaintiffs and they were never put into possession of the suit lands. Rather, found that the widow and the son of Nolini transferred the entire suit land in schedule-I in favour of Sumoti Bala and Rajib Kumar by 9 (nine) registered <em>kabalas</em> dated 24.10.1972 and 10.09.1974. The defendant No.1 also purchased 0.18 acres of land from Jogendra. The Trial Court also found on evidence that the defendants are in possession of the suit land. With these findings, the Trial Court dismissed the suit.<br/><br/>7. On appeal, the learned additional District Judge, First Court, Chittagong, affirmed the findings of the Trial Court and dismissed the appeal.<br/><br/>8. On revision, the High Court Division endorsed the findings of the Appellate Court and held that is was a case of total ouster of the plaintiffs claim as co-sharer in the suit land. On these findings the Rule was discharged.<br/><br/>9. Being aggrieved, this petition has been filed.<br/><br/>10. Mr. Abdul Momen Chowdhury, Advocate, appearing on behalf of the peti­tioner, submits that Moni Bala became owner of the suit properties from Nalini and Jogendra by registered deeds of sale but the Courts below without any cogent reasons, illegally held that those transac­tions were not acted upon which was also erroneously affirmed by the High Court Division, and upheld the dismissal of the suit for partition on the ground that the plaintiffs were not co-sharers in the suit-lands. The learned Advocate, however, fails to isolate any particular error which was not addressed to by the High Court Division.<br/><br/>11. It appears that the plaintiffs and the defendant Nos.1 and 2 set-up competing claims of right, title and possession in the suit-lands. The Courts below approached the dispute, on the face of the title deeds produced on behalf of the defendant Nos.1 and 2 and the evidence in support of their claim of possession in the suit-lands, that the plaintiffs must prove their own case that the <em>kabal</em>s in favour of Moni Bala were acted upon and they are in posses­sion of the suit-lands based on those kabalas and on the basis of their own evi­dence. The Trial Court found that the plaintiffs failed to prove their claims on the suit-lands on preponderance of evi­dence. The Appellate Court, on reassess­ment of evidence, agreed with the findings of the Trial Court. In revision, the High Court Division also considered the con­tentions raised on behalf of the plaintiffs but justifiably agreed with the findings of the Appellate Court.<br/>Under such circumstances, the con­tentions raised on behalf of the petitioner, has got no substance.<br/><br/>In the result, the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
