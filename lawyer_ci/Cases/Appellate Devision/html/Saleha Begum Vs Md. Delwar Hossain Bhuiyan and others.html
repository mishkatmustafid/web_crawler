Thesuit shop was allotted in favour of one Khandaker Liaquat Ali on 22.12.1983 anda lease deed was executed by the City Corporation on 11.4.1991. While KhandakerLiaquat Ali had been running his business at the said shop, he transferreed thepossession of the same to defendant No. 2 on 19.11.1991. After purchasedefendant No. 2 mutated his name with the Dhaka City Corporation and paid theCity Corporation Tax and other dues. Subsequently, defendant No. 2 sold out thepermanent possession of the suit shop in favour of the plaintiff</span><span style='Courier New";Times New Roman";'>on 02.09.1996 by executing document and also by swearing an affidavit beforethe Notary Public on 16.9.1996. The plaintiff duly took over possession of thesuit shop. Defendant No. 2 filed an application to the Chief Revenue Officer,Dhaka City Corporation, Dhaka for mutating thesuit shop in the name of the plaintiff. At the time of mutation proceedings theplaintiff came to know that defendant No.1 collusively created forged deed of gifton 02.1.1995 in respect of the suit shop though defendant No. 2 nevertransferred the same to her by way of gift. As defendant No. 1 created a falseand fraudulent deed of gift in respect of the suit shop and thus clouded plaintiff’stitle thereto he was compelled to file the suit for declaration of title to theshop and also declaration that the alleged deed of gift as described inschedule ‘Kha’ to the plaint and the affidavit were illegal, fraudulent, notregular and were not binding upon him. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-autospace:none"><span style='Courier New";Times New Roman";'>The suit was contested by defendant No. 1 by filinga written statement denying the material statements made in the plaint andcontending, <i>inter alia</i> that defendant No. 2, her husband transferred thesuit shop in her favour on 02.1.1995 in lieu of her dower and inducted her intopossession thereof. Defendant No. 2 also executed an undertaking on 08.02.1995in favour of defendant No. 1 in respect of the suit shop admitting the saidfact of transfer by way of gift and he paid rent of the suit shop on behalf ofdefendant No. 1 because of her other pre-occupation. Defendant No. 2 also sworean affidavit on 10.9.1996 before a Notary Public admitting the fact that he hadtransferred the suit shop to defendant No. 1. Defendant No. 1 being inpossession of the suit shop as its rightful owner applied to the Dhaka CityCorporation on 10.9.1996 for mutating her name. On the basis of the saidapplication the Dhaka City Corporation asked defendant No. 1 to submit papers,which fact being informed to defendant No. 2, he in turn executed anAngikarnama as per the proforma of Dhaka City Corporation and also executed adocument identifying the signature of the defendant before a Notary Public on 20.11.1996.In the said Angikarnama defendant No. 2 clearly mentioned that he had noobjection if the name of defendant No. 1 was mutated in his place. As theplaintiff also filed an application for mutating his name while the process formutating her name in respect of the suit shop was going on, some complicationarose. The defendant came to know about the said fact of filing of theapplication by the plaintiff to mutate his name and was surprised. Sheperceived that taking the advantage of the fact of looking after the suit shopon her behalf, her husband, defendant No. 2 in collusion with the plaintiffcreated an undated deed in favour of the plaintiff in respect of the suit shop.As doubt cropped up in the mind of the defendant No. 1 after coming to know of thesaid fact, she decided to realize rent of the suit shop from the tenant and tothat end went to the suit shop, but she did not find her tenant Shah Alam.After making query from the neighbouring shop owners the defendant No. 1 cameto know that defendant No. 2 evicted the said tenant forcibly. Defendant No. 2though evicted defendant’s tenant, yet he continued to pay her rent for thesuit shop for which she could not know the fact of eviction of her tenant.Subsequently, the defendant No. 1 took possession of the suit shop and again letout the same to her tenant and her tenant is currently continuing his businessin the shop under the name and style, “Shuapna Tailors and Cloth Store” andthus she is in possession of the suit shop through her tenant. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-autospace:none"><span style='Courier New";Times New Roman";'>Defendant No. 2 filed written statement admittingthe case of the plaintiff, asserting further the fact that he never transferredthe suit shop to defendant No. 1 by way of gift.

He furthersubmitted that the appellate Court found that the relationship of defendantNos. 1 and 2 became strained and deteriorated and as such out of grudge andvengeance defendant No. 2 in collusion with the plaintiff subsequently createdthe document of transfer in the name of the plaintiff on 16.09.1996. Thelearned Advocate further pointed out that the City Corporation, being the ownerof the shop admitted the possession of defendant No. 1 in their writtenstatement. The learned Advocate submitted that the High Court Division erred inlaw in setting aside the judgement and decree of the lower appellate court,which is the last court of facts. In this connection he referred to the decessionreported in 5 MLR (A.D.) 256 and 57 DLR (A.D.) 55. He finally submitted thatthe claim of defendant No. 1 that her husband transferred the suit shop to herby way of oral gift, which was supported by an affidavit and a deed of giftexecuted by her husband, which was proved by producing exhibits “A”, “B” and“C”, was not properly considered by the High Court Division.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-autospace:none"><span style='Courier New";'>  We notefrom the impugned judgement that the High Court Division meticulouslyscrutinised all the evidence and materials on record and came to a finding thatdefendant No. 1 failed to prove her possession in the suit shop. In particular,the High Court Division observed that the appellate court did not at allconsider the apparent fact that defendant No. 1 could not produce a singleoriginal document in respect of the suit shop, such as, letter of allotment,deed of agreement, rent receipt showing realisation of rents for the suit shop,whereas these original documents were produced by the plaintiff. The High CourtDivision also observed that the defendant No. 1 failed to prove that her tenantShah Alam was forcibly evicted by examining a witness from the market. The HighCourt Division also noted that the appellate court did not consider theevidentiary value of PWs 2, 3 and 4 who supported the plaintiff’s case thatafter purchase of the possessory right of the suit shop he got possessionthereof. The High Court Division highlighted the contradiction in the statementof defendant No. 1 in her written statement that her husband transferred thesuit shop to her by way of oral gift, whereas in evidence in court she produceda written deed of gift, and added that a written gift by a person must beregistered as provided in <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 0%; background-clip: border-box; background-origin: padding-box; background-size: auto auto;">section123 of the Transfer of Property Act and section 17 of the Registration Act</span></span>.The High Court Division observed that the production of the documents exhibits“A”, “B” and “C” falsified the testimony of DWs 2 and 5.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-autospace:none"><span style='Courier New";'>Having carefully considered the evidence andmaterials before us, we are of the view that the defendant No. 1 could notsatisfactorily prove the gift of the suit shop in her favour. She contradictedher own claim of an oral gift by producing in evidence written documents ofgift. On the other hand, she did not prove the written deed of gift byproducing any witness to the deed to support her claim. Moreover, as observedby the High Court Division, a written deed of gift of immovable property isrequired to be registered. It was the clear finding of the High Court Divisionthat the deed of gift having not been registered, the transfer is void.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-autospace:none"><span style='Courier New";'>In view of the above discussion, we do not findany illegality or infirmity in the judgement of the High Court Division.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-autospace:none"><span style='Courier New";'>Accordingly, the civil petition for leave to appealis dismissed, without, however, any order as to costs.</span><b><u><span style='Courier New"'> </span></u></b></p><span id="pastemarkerend"> </span> </div></div>
