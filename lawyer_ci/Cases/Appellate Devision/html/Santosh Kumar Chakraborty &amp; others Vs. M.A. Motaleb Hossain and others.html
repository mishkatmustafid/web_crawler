This appeal is directed against the High Court Division's order dated 4 March 1982 in Civil Division No. 495 of 1981 reversing an order of the Subordinate Judge by which an <em>ex parte </em>decree dated 28 September 1974 was set aside under Order IX Rule 13 of the Civil Procedure Code. This <em>ex parte</em> decree was passed in Title Suit No 8 of 1974 of the 1st Court of Subordinate Judge. Dhaka, filed by the plaintiff-respondent against the defendants-appellants for specific performance of contract for sale of a premise in Dhaka Municipal area. The suit was filed on 7 January 1974 and was decreed <em>ex parte </em>on 28 September 1974 when the defendants, though served with notice as the record shows, did not appear to contest. The defendants challenged the decree by filing an application on 24 October 1975 alleging that no summons was served upon them but the summons was suppressed fraudulently. The plaintiff con­tested the application stating that the summons was duly served by the process server by hanging it on their door when the defendants refused to receive the summons by signing acknowledgment and further that the applica­tion was barred by limitation of about thir­teen months as the defendants knew of the suit as early as on 10 May 1974 in connec­tion with a Mutation Case filed by them in which the plaintiff filed an objection stating that be had filed the suit for specific performance of contract in respect of the same property. The trial Court on consideration of evidence of 3 witnesses for the defendants and 10 witnesses for the plaintiff set aside the <em>ex parte</em> decree on a finding that "the defendants were sufficiently prevented from appearing in the Court when the suit was taken up for hearing" and that there was no declaration from the court that summons was duly served. On a revisional application the learned Judges of the High Court Division interfered with this decision of the trial Court holding that the trial Court on erroneous view of law and fact arrived at the finding that there was no declaration from the court that summons was duly served, whereas, in fact, there was such a declaration.<br/><br/>3. Mr. Rafiq-ul-Huq, learned Advocate for the appellants contends that the provisions of an enquiry by examining the process server in Court are mandatory under rule 19 of Order V of the Civil Procedure Code, but the learned Judges of the High Court Division erroneously held that these provi­sions are discretionary. On this point the learned Advocate is not found to be correct. The learned Judges have pointed out, and we find correctly, that two classes of cases are contemplated in rule 19, that in one class of cases, examination of the process server is mandatory, and in another class of cases it is discretionary. Where the serving officer has returned the summons and has also made a declaration to the effect that he served the summons by affixation under rule 17, then, examination of the process server as a witness in Court is not mandatory, particularly when the ''proviso" to this rule shows that a declaration of the serving offi­cer "shall be received as evidence of the facts as to the service or admitted service of the summons". In this case, admittedly the serving officer (O P.W. 6) made a declara­tion that he went to the defendants' house with the summons but the latter refused to receive the summons whereupon he served it by hanging it on the defendants' door in, presence of witness. But where there is no such declaration of the serving officer, exami­nation of the serving officer as a witness is mandatory. For better appreciation of this provision, rule 19 is quoted below: <br/>"19. Where a summons is returned under rule 17, the Court shall, if the return under that rule has not been verified by the declaration of the ser­ving officer, and may, if it has been so verified, examine the serving officer on oath, or cause him to be so examined by another court, touching his proceedings, and may make such fur­ther inquiry in the matter as it thinks fit; and shall either declare that the summons has been duly served or order such service as it thinks fit." <br/><br/>4. Mr. Rafiq-ul-Huq in this connection refers to sub-rule (2) of rule 91 of the Civil Rules and Orders which provides that where service has been effected under rule 17 of Order V, it is incumbent upon the Court to make an enquiry and to record a declara­tion of due service. Enquiry for the purpose of recording a declaration as referred to does not necessarily mean that the serving officer shall be examined in Court, even when his declaration is there in record along with the service return. Rule 91 (2) of the Civil Rules and Orders must be read and considered along with rule 19 Order V, C.P.C. We therefore find that non examination of the process ser­ver in this case as a witness in the trial Court which passed the <em>ex parte</em> decree could not be a ground for holding that provisions of rule 9 were not complied with.<br/><br/>5. The next question is whether the second provision of rule 19, i.e. regarding the Court's declaration as to due service of summons has been complied with. This provision is mandatory, whether the serving officer is or is not required to be examined as a witness. The learned Judges have cor­rectly construed this provision and observed that "again in both the cases it is mandatory on the Court to either declare that the sum­mons has been duly served or orders such service, as it thinks fit". Contention of the learned Advocate for the appellant that the High Court Division erroneously held this provision to be discretionary is not based on careful reading of the High Court Division's judgment. The real controversy in respect of this provision is in which '"manner" or "form" the Court shall record a declaration that summons has been duly served. Mr. Rafiq-ul-Huq has contended that a specific and separate declaration is required to be made by the court and that mere recording in the order-sheet that 'summons has been served' is not sufficient compliance of this mandatory provision In support of this contention he has relied upon a decision of a learned Single Judge of the High Court Division in the case of<strong><em> Zohora Begum Vs. Razaul Quader, 25 DLR 91</em></strong>. The learned Judges in the instant case perused that deci­sion and, disagreeing therewith, held that ''no particular form or manner has been prescribed in which a declaration under Ord­er V, rule 19 C.P.C. shall he made by the Court". The learned Judges took the view that the recording by the trial Court in the order-sheet of the suit that summons has been served is sufficient compliance of the provision as to court's declaration that su­mmons has been duly served, In fact when the service is returned with a declaration of the serving officer that he served the sum­mons by hanging it on a conspicuous part of the- defendants' house or his place of work in presence of witnesses and if the Court perused the declaration along with the ser­vice return containing names of witnesses in whose presence summons was purportedly served and records his satisfaction that su­mmons has duly served, then the mandatory provision of the rule as to declaration has been complied with. Leave   was granted by us upon the submission that the entire pro­visions of rule 19 were held to be discreti­onary by the High Court Division, but in fact, this has not been done; the High Co­urt Division in a well reasoned judgment exp­lained various aspects of the provisions of this rule and found that the learned Sub­ordinate Judge on misconception of law held that there was no declaration as to due service.<br/><br/>6. Khondkar Mahbubuddin Ahmed, le­arned Advocate for the respondents while defending the High Court Division's judgment contended that the very proceedings under Order IX, rule 13 C.P.C. became infructuous as the <em>ex parte </em>decree was fully satisfied through execution, that the necessary sale-deed was executed and registered by the court and possession of the land was also delivered as there was no order from the superior Court staying the Execution proceeding. Mr. Rafiq-ul-Huq however contends that the execution of an <em>ex parte</em> decree does not render the appli­cation for setting aside the <em>ex parte</em> decree infructuous, for, even after execution of the decree, the petitioner has got remedy by way of restitution under section 144 C P C; and in support of this contention, the learned Ad­vocate has referred to a number of decisions particularly the decision in the case of <strong><em>Keshab Chandra Vs. Baliganj Estate Pvt. Limited, 76 CWN 281</em></strong>. We find substance in this conten­tion and hold that the proceedings under Order IX, rule 13 did not become infructuous has earlier execution of the decree.<br/><br/>7. Khondkar Mahbuddin Ahmed has next referred to a number of glaring errors of law in the judgment of the learned Sub­ordinate Judge. He has pointed out that the ex-parte decree was challenged on the ground of non-service of summons and the learned Subordinate Judge arrived at a finding that summons, was in fact served, but ''not duly" as the process server did not give the defen­dants" reasonable time and opportunity to receive the summons" as required under rule 17. The learned Advocate contends that there is no requirement of law for giving such opportunity when the defendants refused to receive the summons. It is clear that the provision of rule 17 has been misconceived by the learned Subordinate Judge in that this rule provides that if the defendant cannot be found the serving officer should exercise due dili­gence to find him out before serving the summons by hanging, but this provision is not applicable when the defendant has been found but he has refused to receive the su­mmons. In such a case, no question of exer­cising due diligence arises and the summons may be served at once by affixation. The learned Advocate has next contended that the question of limitation was erroneously de­cided by the learned Subordinate Judge by omitting from consideration Ext. D, a written objection, filed by the respondent in Muta­tion Case No. 40 of 1973 between the same parties in respect of the same property. In that Mutation case, which was filed by the appellants themselves, the respondent filed the written objection on 10th May, 1974 stating that he had already filed a suit for specific performance of contract namely, the instant suit, whereupon his objection was heard on 28th May 1974. The <em>ex parte </em>decree was passed four months thereafter, and as such, the defendant had definite knowledge of the suit, the learned advocate further contends. The learned Subordinate Judge did not consider the impact of Ext. D but dismissed it as it referred to "a matter prior to the passing of the impugned decree’.<br/><br/>8. Mr. Rafiq ul-Huq contends that whether the summons was duly served or not is a ques­tion of fact and the finding arrived at by the trial Court on this question cannot be interfered with in revision. But this finding is found to have resulted from glaring misconception of law as well as non-consideration of material evidence, and as such is not immu­ne from interference in revision under section 115 C.P.C. The High Court Division in frit circumstance rightly interfered therewith. The appeal from this judgment must fail. In the result, the appeal is dismissed without how ever any cost.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
