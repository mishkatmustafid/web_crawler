Fazlul Karim J.-</strong> This appeal by leave is at the instance of plaintiff-appellant who filed the suit for ejectment, arrear of rents and compensation stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the defendant-respondent was a monthly tenant at a rental of Taka 300 per month as per agreement dated 15-8-1971. Although the tenancy commenced from 15th August 1971 by mutual agreement between the parties the monthly rent was paid according to English calendar month upto month of September 1973. The premises was also required for bonafide use of plaintiff who have served notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act on 18-1-1974 determining the monthly tenancy on the expiry of 28th day of February. 1974 by registered post which was refused by the defendant on 26-1-1974 whereupon the plaintiff was constrained to file the suit. Defendant respondent contested the suit asserting <em>inter alia</em>, no notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act was served on him and the same is also invalid and illegal. He was not a tenant under the plaintiff in respect of the suit premises and he was not a defaulter as he has been depositing monthly rent in HR Case No. 30 of 1974 and the plaintiff has no bonafide requirement of the premises in question.  <br/><br/>2. The trial Court decreed the suit and on appeal the same was affirmed. Thereafter the respondent moved the High Court Division in revision and the Rule was made absolute dismissing the suit disturbing the concurrent finding of fact as to notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act.  <br/><br/>3. On perusal of the impugned judgment it appears that the High Court Division arrived at the findings that:<br/>“I have considered the above submissions of the learned Counsel for the opposite party. From his submission it is clear that he wants to down gave (sic) Exhibit 1, which is a bilateral document between the parties. If the contention of the learned Counsel for the opposite party is accepted that payment of rent was made according to the English calendar month, then it is not understood what prevented the opposite party from serving the notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act terminating the tenancy with the expiry of the 15th day of the month. The learned Counsel for the opposite party has no possible explanation for this nor has he any explanation as to why Exhibit 2 was issued on 18-1-1974. In my opinion, the opposite party has been in a fix which path he will tread or which course he will follow in the matter of service of notice.”  <br/>“I am in full agreement what has been submitted by the learned Counsel for the petitioner. The opposite party is required to keep himself within the confines of Exhibit l. He cannot whimsically vary or alter its terms and conditions. He cannot work out a period of his own choice for termination of determination of the tenancy in utter violation of the terms as set further in Exhibit 1. So in my view. Exhibit 2 is not a valid and legal notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act in the matter of determination and termination of the tenancy of the petitioner. In view of the facts and circumstances of the case and for the reasons stated above, the judgment and decree complained of are not tenable in law. They, therefore, are set aside and the suit of the opposite party dismissed.”<br/><br/>4. Thereafter, leave was granted to consider that “Mr. Mustafa Niaz Muhammad, learned Advocate appearing for the appellant, submits that the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division erred in law in not finding that in either view of the matter i.e., terms of contract Exhibit I dated 15-8-1971 which speaks for 1 (one) month’s notice for terminating tenancy and provision of section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act regarding notice in the absence of contract, the requirement of law has been complied with. The notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property, Exhibit 2 having been issued on 18-1-1974 terminating the tenancy with the expiry of 28th day of February 1974 is legal and valid.”  <br/><br/>5. Mr. Mostafa Niaz Mohammad, the learned Advocate for the Appellant, has submitted that in view of the covenant in Exhibit 1 dated 15-8-71 providing one month’s notice for terminating tenancy, the notice under section 106 Transfer of Property Act Exhibit 2 having been issued on 18-1-74 terminating tenancy with the expiry of 28-2-74, the High Court Division erred in law in not holding the tenancy has been terminated with the service of notice under section 106 Transfer of Property Act.  <br/><br/>6. The respondent who has not filed any concise statement in the appeal is represented by Dr Rafiqur Rahman, the learned Counsel who though could not repeal the submission of the learned Advocate for the appellant but faintly sought to support the impugned Judgment submitting that if the tenancy commenced on 15th August, 1971 it has to be determined on service of notice for one month and such notice dated 18-1-74 determining tenancy with the expiry of 28th February, 1974 is not a proper and valid notice determining tenancy.  <br/><br/>7. Agreement between the parties provides, <em>inter alia</em>, in clause (4) that. “The tenancy of the 2nd party shall terminate with one month’s notice from the 1st party and similarly, the 2nd party also shall give one months notice to the 1st party in case he wants to vacate the premises close the 2nd party shall be liable to pay rent in lieu of notice.” The aforesaid clause speaks for one month’s notice in order to terminate the tenancy.  <br/><br/>8. In the instant case pursuant to clause (4) above a notice dated 18-1-1974 was served upon the respondent-tenant determining the tenancy with effect from 28th day of February 1974 and though the period of notice dated 18-1-1974 determining the tenancy with effect from 28-2-1984 was more than period of 30 days contemplated by Exhibit 1 the same do not in any way prejudice the petitioner or suffer from any illegality or infirmity in the service of notice determining the tenancy and is in consonance with the terms of Exhibit 1 and the provision of law in spite of the fact that the payment of rent was according to the English calendar month and only 15 days’ notice is required for determination and termination of the tenancy under the provision of section 106, Transfer to Property Act. In that view of the matter allowing more than one month’s notice to determine the tenancy has not contravened any of the provision of the Transfer of Property Act or the Premises Rent Control Ordinance or the terms of Exhibit 1 as there was no alteration or variation thereof and the same is valid compliance with the agreement between the parties and thus the notice determining the tenancy is also a valid one.  <br/><br/>9. The High Court Division in revision could interfere with the concurrent findings of fact the Courts below only on the ground of error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice. The findings of the Courts below based on consideration of the evidence on record is not liable to be interfered with in revision. The revisional power exercised by the High Court Division is discretionary and is to be exercised to prevent error of law occasioning failure of justice. But in the instant case the High Court Division wrongly construed the terms of Exhibit I in its finding that the notice under section 106, Transfer of Property Act is not a valid and legal notice. Thus, the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division suffers from illegality and infirmity.  <br/><br/>10. In view of the above, the impugned judgment of the High Court Division is not sustainable in law and accordingly, the same is liable to be set aside.  <br/>In the result, this appeal is allowed without costs setting aside the impugned judgment of the High Court Division and restoring those of the Courts below decreeing the suit.  <br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
