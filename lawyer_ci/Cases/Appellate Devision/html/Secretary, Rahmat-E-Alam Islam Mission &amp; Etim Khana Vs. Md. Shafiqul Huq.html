The High Court Division held that this will be sometimes after 1980 as the <em>ex parte </em>decree was passed on 05.06.1980 and the law on enemy proper­ty itself died with the repeal of Ordinance 1 of 1969 with effect from 23.03.1974 and no further vested property case could be started thereafter. Accordingly, the High Court Division held that the plaintiff hav­ing failed to prove that the S.A. recorded tenants left for India in 1965 and the suit land became enemy property, he has no <em>locus standi</em> to challenge the decree passed in Title Suit No.346 of 1977. The High Court Division further observed that P.W.1 admitted that the summons of Title Suit No.346 of 1977 was served upon the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka. There is no evidence of any fraud practised upon the party or upon the court in obtaining the decree in Title Suit No. 346 of 1977. Non-inclusion of Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) in charge of vested property is not a fraudulent act to turn down the earlier decree on the ground of fraud are rightly held by the lower appellate court that non-joinder of a party may not defeat the suit is all cases. ..

Ruhul Amin J. -</strong>These two petitions for leave to appeal are directed against the common judgment and order dated 23.02.2005 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision Nos. 3992 &amp; 2974 of 1999 discharging both the Rules.<br/><br/>2. Short facts are that the plaintiff institut­ed Title Suit No. 66 of 1991 in the Court of the Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Additional Court, Dhaka for declaration that the judgment and decree dated 05.06.1980 passed in Title Suit No. 346 of 1977 by the 1st Court of Subordinate Judge(now Joint District Judge), Dhaka is illegal, void and not binding upon the plaintiff stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit land originally belonged to Priaya Nath Basak, Nagendra Nath Basak, Bhupendra Nath Basak and Digendra Nath Basak who were owners of the suit land to the extent of 4 annas share each and their names were correctly recorded in the S.A. Khatian and that dur­ing 1965 war between India and Pakistan the aforesaid S.A. recorded owners left the country for India and the suit land was declared and treated as enemy property (now vested property). The suit land was leased out to one Abdul Baten in E.P. Case No.210 of 1967 and subsequently lease was granted to Rahmat-E-Alam Islam Mission who also paid lease money up 1385 B.S. The further allegation is that the defendant obtained an <em>ex parte </em>decree in Title Suit No.346 of 1977 on 06.05.1980 declaring that the suit land is not vested and non-resident property and it was their purchased land from Rathindra Nath Basak who was the adopted son of Debendra Nath Basak by registered kabala dated 21.07.1977. The Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka was impleaded as a party in the said suit land but the Assistant Custodian of the vested and non-resident property was not impleaded in the suit as a party in Title Suit No. 346 of 1977 and thus <em>ex parte </em> decree dated 05.06.1980 is, illegal, void and not binding upon the plaintiff.<br/><br/>3. The defendant No.1 contested the suit by filing a written statement contending, <em>inter alia,</em> that the suit land originally belonged to Debendra Nath Basak, Lal Mohan Basak and Promotha Nath Basak and by an amicable partition, the suit land fell in the saham of Debendra Nath Basak, one of the sons of Modon Mohan Basak who got 4 annas share in the suit land. Debendra Nath Basak died issueless leav­ing behind only a widow who adopted a son named Rathindra Nath Basak and the suit land was recorded in the name of Rathindra Nath Basak on mutation in the S.A. Khatian and the defendants pur­chased the suit land from Rathindra Nath Basak by two separate registered kabalas on 21.07.1977 and got their names mutat­ed in the Khatian. The defendant was compelled to file Title Suit No.346 of 1977 against the present plaintiff and oth­ers. The summons was duly served upon the plaintiff and others but none appeared to contest the suit and the suit was ulti­mately decreed <em>ex parte </em>on 05.06.1980. The defendants then filed an application for correction of the S.A. record before the Circle Officer (Revenue) on the basis of the decree passed in Title Suit No. 346 of 1977 and when the matter was, placed before the Circle Officer he refused the proposal for correction on the ground that the suit land was declared vested and non-vested property. It was further alleged that the suit land was leased out to one Monir Hossain and others and subsequently to defendant No.12 who was put in posses­sion in respect of 13.70 acres of land and has been possessing the same. The further allegation is that the defendant Nos.1-11 of Title Suit No.346 of 1977 obtained an <em>ex parte </em>decree though they were not own­ers of the suit land. It was further alleged that adoption Rathindra Nath Basak was illegal and invalid.<br/><br/>4. The trial court decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiff. The defendants then pre­ferred Title Suit No.357 of 1992. The appellate court allowed the appeal and dis­missed the plaintiff’s suit. Being aggrieved thereby the plaintiff being the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) in charge of the vested and non-resident property, Dhaka moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained the Rules. The defendant No. 12, Secretary, Rahmat-E-Alam Islam Mission and Etimkhana as petitioner has obtained another Rule being Civil Revision No.2974 of 1999. Since both the Rules arising out of self-same judgment of the appellate court, were heard together and disposed of by the impugned judgment. The High Court Division upon hearing the parties discharging the Rules as noticed earlier.<br/><br/>5. We have heard Mr. Fazlul Haque, the learned Advocate for the petitioner in both the cases and Mr. Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan, the learned Counsel for respondent Nos. 1-10 in both the cases and perused the judg­ment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/><br/>6. The High Court Division held that there is nothing on record to indicate that any vested property case was started in respect of the suit land but from the evidence on record it was found that the Title Suit No.346 of 1977 was decreed <em>ex parte </em>on 05.06.1980. The High Court Division held that this will be sometimes after 1980 as the <em>ex parte </em>decree was passed on 05.06.1980 and the law on enemy proper­ty itself died with the repeal of Ordinance 1 of 1969 with effect from 23.03.1974 and no further vested property case could be started thereafter. Accordingly, the High Court Division held that the plaintiff hav­ing failed to prove that the S.A. recorded tenants left for India in 1965 and the suit land became enemy property, he has no <em>locus standi</em> to challenge the decree passed in Title Suit No.346 of 1977. The High Court Division further observed that P.W.1 admitted that the summons of Title Suit No.346 of 1977 was served upon the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka. There is no evidence of any fraud practised upon the party or upon the court in obtaining the decree in Title Suit No. 346 of 1977. Non-inclusion of Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) in charge of vested property is not a fraudulent act to turn down the earlier decree on the ground of fraud are rightly held by the lower appellate court that non-joinder of a party may not defeat the suit is all cases. The High Court Division further held, "I have examined the documentary evidence and the oral evidence but I could not find out any materials indicating that any fraud was practiced upon the party or the court in obtaining the decree in Title Suit No. 346 of 1977. The learned Advocate for the petitioners could not point out any evi­dence indicating fraud committed by the plaintiffs of the earlier suit in obtaining the earlier <em>ex parte </em>decree, I do not therefore, find any error of law committed by the lower appellate court in dismissing the plaintiffs suit. The trial court made a total­ly wrong approach to the pleading of the parties and the evidence on record." The High Court Division further held that non-inclusion of a party cannot be construed as a fraud.<br/><br/>7. The learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Dhaka who was in charge of vested and non-resident prop­erty was not a party in Title Suit No.346 of 1977 and as such the decree is not binding on him. Therefore, the decree is liable to be set aside. In this connection it may be stated that since the petitioner was not party to the decree, the same is not auto­matically binding on him. A void decree needs to be avoided by a decree of a com­petent court but a voidable decree need be avoided by a decree of the court of compe­tent jurisdiction. Therefore no suit is maintainable at the instance of such a party for declaration that the decree passed in such a suit is not binding on him.<br/><br/>8. In the case of <strong><em>Munsur Ali Mallik Vs. Md. Nurul Haque Mallik and others</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>BCR 1986 (AD) 56</em></strong> the plaintiff challenged the decree obtained in Title Suit No.69 of 1961 by one Lakshman Chandra Dhupi, predecessor of the defen­dant. In the suit, the plaintiff was not a party. In the second appeal, the High Court Division considered the submission exhaustively and it was noticed that in the suit of Lakshman Chandra Dhupi, the plaintiff, was not a party. Hence the suit for declaration that the decree passed in Title Suit No.69 of 1961 at the instance of Lakshman Chandra Dhupi could not be entertained. In this view of the matter, the appeal was dismissed.<br/><br/>9. In the facts and circumstances of the case and in view of the discussions made above, we are of the view that the High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision. There is no cogent reason to interfere with the impugned judgment.<br/>Both the civil petitions accordingly are dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
