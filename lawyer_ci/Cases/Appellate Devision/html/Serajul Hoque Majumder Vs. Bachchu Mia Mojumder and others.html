Ruhul Amin J. - </strong>This petition for leave to appeal is against the judgment dated January  13, 2004 of a single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 744 of 1997 mak­ing  the  Rule  absolute upon setting aside the judgment and decree dated July 6, 1996 of the 3rd Court of Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge) Comilla, in Title Appeal No. 76 of 1994 dismissing the same and there­by affirming the judgment and decree; dated February 28, 1994 of the Court of Assistant judge, Nangalkot, Comilla in Title Suit No. 24 of 1991 decreeing the same. The suit was filed seeking declaration that the judgment and order dated June 29, 1987 passed in Miscellaneous Case (pre-emption) No. 6 of 1984 of the Court of ssistant Judge, Nangalkot was fraudulent and as such liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>2. It was the case of the plaintiffs that certain Elahi Baksha had interest to the extent of 8 annas 6 gondas and 2 karas in the property described in the schedule 1 by inheritance from his mother and Elahi Baksha died leaving 2 daughters, by name, Syedennessa and Jobeda Khatun and 2 sons, Hasanuzzaman and Joynal Abedin and a widow by name Khatijan Bibi who died leaving 2 sons, defendant No.1 and another and 2 daughters, that Hasanuzzaman died leaving 3 sons and 3 daughters, that defendant No. 10, daughter of Ellahi Baksha transferred the schedule land to her co-sharer defendant No.9 and he is possessing the same, that defendant No. 9 transferred 26 decimals of land from the land of schedule No.1 to defendant No. 69 by the kabala dated March 4, 1984 and also transferred 12 decimals of land from the land of schedule No.1 by the kabala of the same date to the plaintiffs, that plaintiffs and the defendant No. 69 purchased 38 decimals of land and developed the same by earth; filling and constructed homestead and are possessing the same. Defendant No.1, now deceased, was aware of the purchase, development and possession of the land, that defendant No. 9 is a co-sharer by inheritance. Defendant No.1 since deceased (survived by defendant Nos. 2-8) filed Miscellaneous Case No. 6 of 1984 under Section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act on February 26, 1984. Defendant No.9, vendor of the plaintiffs, contested the said case. The Miscellaneous Case was allowed on June 29, 1987 and as against that defendant No.9 filed Appeal being Miscellaneous Appeal No. 88 of 1987 but the defendant No. 9 withdrew the same on being influenced by the defendant Nos.2-8, that the plaintiffs after having had knowledge about the judgment of the Miscellaneous Case filed the suit seeking the relief as stated hereinbefore.<br/><br/>3. The suit was contested by the defendant Nos. 1-8 by filing written statement denying the material averments made in the plaint. It was the case of the defendants that the suit so filed was barred by limitation and the suit as framed is not maintainable. It was also the case of the defendants that the kabalas on the basis of which defen­dant No.96 is claiming the land are ante-dated kabalas and the same have been brought into existence during the pendency of the pre-emption case, that defendant No.9 who contested the case did not disclose about the transfer to the plaintiffs, that plaintiffs were not necessary parties in the re-emption case, that no fraud was committed in obtaining the order in the Miscellaneous case and that the judg­ment and order passed in the Miscellaneous case is quite legal.<br/><br/>4. The trial Court decreed the suit on the finding that the plaintiffs have been able to establish their case and the suit is quite maintainable and the same is not barred by limitation. The trial Court also held that the plaintiffs are in possession of the land in suit and they have their homestead in the land in suit that defendants failed to dislodge the evidence of P.W. 2 who have deposed that the plaintiffs are in posession of the land in suit.<br/><br/>5. It may be mentioned the Miscellaneous Case No. 6 of 1984 was filed on Februay 26, 1984 to pre-empt the transfer that took place on February 20, 1982 and the prayer for pre-emption was allowed on June 29, 1987.<br/><br/>6. The suit was filed stating that the plaintiffs came to know about the order of pre-emption initially on December 8, 1990 and that become definite about the order allowing the Miscellaneous Case on obtaining certi­fied copy on February 5, 1991. The plaintiffs claim is based on Ext.1 i.e. the kabala executed on November 7, 1983 and registered on March 4, 1984 and also based on Ext. 2 i.e. a kabala executed on Februay 14, 1984 and reg­istered on March 4, 1984.<br/><br/>7. The defendant went on appeal. The appellate Court dismissed the appeal on the finding that from the evidence on record it is seen that the plaintiffs and defendant No. 9 have title in the land of item No. 1 of schedule 1 and they are in possessing of the said land and that order of pre-emption was obtained in Miscellaneous Case No.6 of 1984 without impleading the plaintiffs and the defendant No. 69 and as such the  order of pre-emption so obtained is fraudulent and liable to be set aside and that if the same is not set aside the plaintiffs and the defendant No. 69 would be prejudiced, that the suit is not barred by limitation and as  such plaintiffs are entitled to the relief  sought in  the  suit  and  the  suit  as  framed is quite maintainable.             <br/><br/>8. The defendants moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction. The High Court Division in the facts of the case, particularly because of the Exts. 1 and 2 on the basis of which the plaintiffs and the defendant No. 69 claimed title, held that plaintiffs and defendant No.69 were not necessary parties in the Miscellaneous Case and as such order obtained in the Miscellaneous Case without impleading the plaintiffs and the defendant No. 69 cannot be said to have been obtained fraudulently. The High Court Division also held that plaintiffs and defendant No. 69's vendor contested the Miscellaneous case and he lost in the same and that although he filed appeal but ultimately withdrew the same. The High Court Division finally held that the courts below in mis-con­struction of the document Exts. 1 and 2 decreed the suit on the finding that plaintiffs were necessary parties in the miscellaneous Case and that order of the Miscellaneous Case as was obtained without impleading the plain­tiffs the same was fraudulent.<br/><br/>9. We have heard the learned Counsel for the petitioner and perused the materials on record. The Miscellaneous Case No. 6 of 1984 (filed on February 26, 1984) was filed seeking pre-emption of the transfer for pre-emption was allowed by the order dated June 29, 1987. The plaintiffs are claiming title in the land of item No.1 of schedule 1 on the basis of their pur­chase by Exts.1 and 2. It is seen from the materials on record that Ext.1 was executed on November7, 1983 and was registered on March 4, 1984 and that Ext. 2 was executed on February 14, 1984 and the same was registered on March 4, 1984. It is evident that he transfer sought to be pre-empted in Miscellaneous Case No.6 of 1984 took place at a time when the plaintiffs did not acquire any interest in the land of the holding. In that view of the matter we are of the view High Court Division was not in error in dismissing the suit. The learned Counsel for the petitioner although argued that on the registration of the document on March 4, 1984 title of the plaintiffs in view of the provision of section 47 of the Registration Act become perfect on and from the date of the documents so executed and in the instant case execu­tion of the Exts.1 and 2 being prior to the filling of the Miscellaneous case, the plaintiffs were very much neces­sary party in the Miscellaneous Case. The contention so made is not legally well conceived since in the Miscellaneous Case No. 6 of 1984 pre­emption was sought in respect of the transfer that took place on February 20, 1982 and as such the pre-emptor was required to implead in the Miscellaneous Case those who were the co-sharers on February 20, 1982 and not the person who have acquired interest in the land of the holding subsequent to the transfer sought to be pre-empted and as such the High Court Division has quite correctly held that the plaintiffs were not necessary parties in the Miscellaneous Case and consequent thereupon order of pre­-emption obtained therein without impleading the plaintiffs was not a fraudulent one.<br/><br/>10. In the light of the discussions made hereinbefore we find no substance in the petition.<br/>Accordingly the petition if, dis­missed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
