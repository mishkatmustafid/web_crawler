It is a pre-emption case. Pre-emption Mis­cellaneous Case No. 160 of 1974 was instituted un­der section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act in the Court of Munsif, 1st Court, Dhaka. Later it was transferred to the Court of Munsif, Gazipur and it was renumbered as Pre-emption Miscellaneous Case No. 109 of 1983. Pre-emption was sought with regard to .70 acres of land out of 3.22 acres and the pre-emptor deposited Taka 4000/- with compen­sation at the rate of 10% while filing the pre­emption case. The pre-emptees contended that the proportionate value of the pre-empted land would come to Tk. 8,680/- and since the deposit is short the application for pre-emption must fail.<br/><br/>3. It appears that on 16.11.83 the pre-emptor made an application before the trial Court for leave to deposit the balance consideration money with stat­utory compensation. This was objected to by the pre-emptees. The learned Munsif, however, allowed the application. Being aggrieved by this order the pre-emptee filed a Civil Revision and obtained the rule. It was contended that the application for pre­emption was filed with short deposit and as such it was an incompetent application. Facts may be noted Kabala under pre-emption is dated 8.4.74. Pre-­emption case was filed on 2.5.74. Written objection was filed on 30.11.74. It was contended that the pre-emptor opposite party No. 1 had no opportunity in deposit the balance consideration with statutory compensation within four months of the dale of sale, be­cause the petitioners themselves filed their written objection much later. It was contended before the learned Judge that the trial Court did not give the petitioners an opportunity of being heard nor did hold any enquiry as to the actual amount of the considera­tion money. The learned Single Judge considered sec­tion 96(3)(b) of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act and noticed the circumstances when the Court may hold an enquiry after giving all the parties an opportunity of being heard for direction to deposit further sum if necessary within specified period. The learned Judge then observed:<br/>"In the present case the pre-emptee petitioners cannot really complain of not gelling an opportunity of being heard and of not holding any enquiry, because the pre-emptor opposite party No. 1 and the Court accepted the proportionate valuation of the land under pre-emption as ob­jected to by the petitioners themselves and if an enquiry was made, the proportionate value could not have been raised beyond the amount slated by the petitioners in their written objection. Surely the petitioners cannot assail the im­pugned order as without jurisdiction. It was passed very much within jurisdiction. The ab­sence of any opportunity to the petitioners to show cause and the absence of any enquiry have not prejudiced the petitioners at all because both the pre-emptor and the Court have accepted the amount as given in the petitioners' written ob­jection."<br/><br/>4. Leave was granted to consider the question whether a prayer for deposit of balance consideration beyond four months was accepted illegally.<br/><br/>5. Mr. M. Nurullah, the learned counsel ap­pearing for the appellants, canvassed that, it was a statutory obligation on the part of the pre-emptor to deposit the balance consideration within the period and since he failed to do so the prayer was illegally granted. This point has no substance. The learned Single Judge of the High Court Division noticed that the present Miscellaneous Case No. 109 of 1983 was stayed at the instance of the opposite party No. 1 till the disposal of another Civil Revision case although the parties in that civil revision were differ­ent and that civil revision case was disposed of by the High Court Division on 24.5.81. Then when the pre-emptor respondent prayed for leave to deposit the balance consideration money with statutory compen­sation the appellants opposed that application. That clearly shows that the appellants were trying to achieve something indirectly namely, frustrating the very pre-emption proceeding. The learned Munsif rightly granted the prayer. The High Court Division was correct in taking the view.<br/>In the result, this appeal is dismissed without any order as to cost.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
