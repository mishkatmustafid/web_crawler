Tafazzul Islam J. -</strong> Both the civil petitions for leave to appeal arise out of the common judgment and order dated 13-3-2004 passed by the High Court Division discharging both the Rules obtained in Writ Petition Nos.2996 and 2997 of 2001 calling in question the common judgment and order dated 24.11.2004 passed by the First Court of Settlement in Case Nos.251 and 252 of 1995 dismissing both the cases.<br/><br/>2. The petitioner filed the above cases before the First Court of Settlement contending, inter alia, that the RAJUK, the respondent No.3, by allotment letter dated 12.2.1962 allotted Plot No.4 situated at Block No. SE(B), Gulshan Model Town, Dhaka, measuring 17 Khathas 13 Chattaks of land in favour of Mohammad Abdus Sattar, the  respondent No.4, and then on 15.10.1963 ; RAJUK duly executed lease deed for 99  years in his  favour which was duly  registered on  16.10.1963; then the  respondent No. 4 duly paid the premium and after getting the building plan approved constructed a two storied residential building on the eastern side of  the above plot; in terms of an agreement for sale between him and the petitioner, the respondent No. 4, in the month of December 1981, handed over the vacant possession of the first floor of the aforesaid two storied residential building situated at the eastern side to the petitioner; then on obtaining necessary permission from the respondent No. 3 the respondent No.4 transferred the above Plot No.4 to the petitioner by a registered sale deed executed and registered on 30.4.1982 at a consideration of the Tk.38,00,000.00 and on 3.5.1982 also delivered vacant possession of the entire premises to the petitioner then the respondent No.3 vide Memo No.DIT/Ed/1933-1 dated 15.6.1982 mutated the name of the petitioner in the said plot; the petitioner then on getting the building plan approved constructed a new independent two storied building on the western side of the above plot which is used as the residence of the Managing Director of the petitioner; the old building situated on the eastern side of the plot is used for the residence of two General Managers of the petitioner, one in the ground floor and the other in the first floor; while the petitioner was thus in lawful possession of the above plot as well as the buildings, Notification dated 28.4.1986 containing "Ka" and "Kha" list were published and at page No.6840 of Kha list both the buildings of the above Plot No.4 belonging to the petitioner were listed as abandoned properties at serial Nos.15 and 16 and hence the cases. The First Court of Settlement, Dhaka, after hearing, dismissed the above cases. Being aggrieved the petitioner filed the above writ petition and the High Court Division, after hearing, discharged the Rules.<br/><br/>3. The learned Counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner, a statutory corporation, complied with all the necessary formalities before purchase of the above Plot No.4 and there being no laches on their part it would be unjust and inequitable if they are deprived of their lawful right, title and interest in the said plot; RAJUK having mutated the name of the respondent No.4 in the above plot and having given him the permission to transfer the above plot in favour of the petitioner and then RAJUK also having mutated the name of this petitioner, there was no scope at all for the petitioner to know that the  above plot was an abandoned property; the acts and omissions of the government  agencies as well as that of RAJUK led the petitioner to purchase the property treating the same as free from all encumbrances and legal defects as to the title and no apparent steps having been taken by the concerned authorities within the span of 10 years after the coining into force of the laws relating to abandoned properties, the petitioner, a statutory corporation having no knowledge about the contents of the files referred to in the judgments under consideration and being not a party to the alleged irregularities and being a bonafide purchaser for value without notice, cannot be denied of their title and interest in the above plot.<br/><br/>4. As it appears the Court of Settlement found that neither of the parties adduced any evidence in support of their claims but the files of the Ministry of Works, which were made available to the court, showed that notice was issued upon the occupant of the above plot to ascertain the basis of their occupation and then the respondent No.4, having claimed to be the allottee/owner of the plot, was asked to submit the original papers of title to the Ministry of Works and also to produce Income Tax payment certificate but he failed to submit those; the file of RAJUK which were made available to the Court, showed certain anomalies in the page numbering; the files of the Government, which were also made available to the court, also showed that there are 8 letters in the file from 25.9.1973 to 17.11.1975 asking the occupants of the above plot No.4 to submit original papers and in a letter dated 4 February 1975 the respondent No.4 enclosed attested copy of the lease deed, copy of the municipal tax bill and a copy of the urban property tax demand notice but none of those were the originals and particularly the lease deed was also not the original one; there was no further correspondence from 17.11.1975 to 22.5.2000; there are also some interpolations in the numbering of the pages following from page 20 in the file which raised the suspicion that some pages have been inserted and in all likelihood some pages have been removed from the file. Considering the above the Court of Settlement dismissed the cases. The High Court Division taking the above facts into consideration particularly the fact that correspondence after 17.1.11.1975 is missing and that the records having been tampered with and noticing that the signatures of the original allottee appearing in the record up to 1969 are different from those appearing since 1974 which is clearly visible in the naked eyes and some difference is also apparent when the signature of M. A. Sattar the respondent No.4, appearing in Annexure-A of the writ petitions is compared with his signature appearing in Annexure-B of the writ petition became satisfied that in the course of their official duties the concerned officers of the Ministry of Works duly issued notices to the then occupiers of the above plot No.4 and before enlisting the said plot in the 'Kha' list of the abandoned property.<br/><br/>5. The High Court Division in its judgment referring to the decision reported in <strong><em>48 DLR (AD) 1</em></strong> took the view that the duty is upon the person, who claims that the property is not abandoned, to show that at the relevant time, i.e. when President's Order 16 of 1972 came into force, the owner of the property was in Bangladesh and was in possession of the property.<br/><br/>6.The High Court Division, also referred to the case of <strong><em>Rasheda Begum Vs. Government of Bangladesh and another, </em></strong>reported in<strong><em> 2 BLC (AD) 158</em></strong> where the Appellate Division held as follows:-<br/>Thus it is clear that the Settlement Court, irrespective of the enlistment of any property either in 'Ka' and 'Kha' list contemplated in section 5 of the Ordinance, is to adjudicate whether the building is an abandoned property and same has vested in the Government as such or that the petitioners purchase of the property has not been affected by the provision of Presidents Order No.16 of 1972.<br/>Admittedly, the property has been listed as an abandoned property. Thus onus lies upon the petitioner to rebut the presumption, provided in subs-section (2) of section 5 that the same was not an abandoned property. No oral evidence has been adduced before the Settlement Court to prove that on 22.2.1972 when President's Order No. 16 of 1972 was promulgated the original lessee, Naimuddin had been present in Bangladesh or his whereabouts were known or that he did not cease to occupy, supervise or manage in person the house in question."<br/><br/>7. The High Court Division also referred to the case of <strong><em>Rahima Begum and others Vs. Court of Settlement </em></strong>reported in<strong><em> 2 BLC (AD) 108</em></strong> where the Appellate Division held as follows:-<br/>"Once a building is included in either list of abandoned properties it is conclusive evidence that the building in questions is an abandoned property which means that the original owner was either not preset in Bangladesh or his whereabouts were not known or he ceased to manage or occupy the property in question at the time President's Order No.16 of 1972 was promulgated that is on 16.2.1972. This is a rebuttal presumption attached to the publication in the Gazette and it is for the claimant who files an application for releasing the property from the list of abandoned property to show that the original owner was present in Bangladesh or his whereabouts were known or he did not cease to occupy or manage the property in question at the time President's Order No.16 of 1972 was promulgated. If the building in question carries a presumption of being an abandoned property it is exempt from any legal process. Be it an auction sale by the Government itself or through court. The petitioners carried the onus to prove the presence or whereabouts or management of the building in question by the original non-Bengali owner when President's Order No.16 of 1972 was promulgated and this burden of proof having not been discharged by them before the Court of Settlement, no case for releasing the holding in question from the list of abandoned property has been made out and the High Court Division rightly discharged the Rule."<br/><br/>8. The High Court Division found that in the instant cases neither the original owner nor the original leasee were present before Court of Settlement and that the Court of Settlement, having considered all the materials placed before it, came to a positive finding that the above plot No.4 has been legally enlisted in the list of abandoned properties and that the Court of Settlement has given cogent reasons in support of its finding.<br/><br/>9. However the fact remains that the petitioner, a statutory corporation, complied with all the necessary formalities before purchasing of the above plot and the acts and omissions of the government agencies as well as of RAJUK, the lessor of the above plot No.4, led the petitioner to treat the above plot as free from all encumbrances and any legal defect as to the title and further RAJUK after mutating the name of the respondent No.4 the original leasee also gave him permission to transfer the above plot in favour of the petitioner and after transfer RAJUK also mutated the name of the petitioner. Further, no apparent steps were also taken by the concerned authorities in respect of the above plot within the span of 10 years after the coming into force of the. laws relating to abandoned properties  and  the  petitioner,  a  statutory corporation, had also no knowledge about the contents of the files referred to in the judgment of the Court of Settlement and is also not a party to the alleged irregularities as shown in the files and the petitioner is also a bonafide purchaser for value without notice and accordingly the petitioner deserves sympathetic and preferential treatment from the concerned authority and so in case of transfer of the above Plot No. 4, the authority concerned should give the petitioner preferable treatment and in the meantime the possession of the petitioner in the above plot No.4, through their tenant, should not also be disturbed till transfer of the same.<br/><br/>With the above observations both the petitions are dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
