This arises from Title Suit No. 110 of 1958, renumbered as Title Suit No. 64 of 1959, again renumbered as Title Suit No.15 of 1962, in the Second Court of Subordinate Judge, Comilla. It was a suit, among other things, for declaration of plain­tiffs' raiyati right, confirmation of possession and injunction and also for declaration that the relevant C.S. Khatians in favour of the defendants are wrong and without any basis. The suit was decreed by the trial Court by its judgment dated 30 September 1963; on appeal by the defendants, the trial Court's decree was modified and the suit was decreed in part by the impugned judgment of the High Court Division dated 24 November 1981 against which this appeal has been filed by the plaintiffs on special leave granted by us.</div> <div style="text-align: justify;">2. Case of the plaintiffs is that the suit land measuring 7.33 acres was an occupancy raiyati which was originally held by Mohar Ali and Rahimuddin. It was under a Howla-interest known as Howla Karimuddin which was held by Ahmad ullah Dewanji. This Howla was under a Sikimi Taluk known as "Taluk Akber Chowdhury" which was recor­ded as Touzi No.302 of Pargana Tora of the Comilla Collcctorate. At a later stage the Touzi was renumbered, because of an arran­gement between the co-sharers landlords, as Touzi No.3414. Plaintiffs are the heirs of Golam Rahman, one of the three sons of the Howlader, Ahmadullah Dewanji. Golam Rahman purchased the entire raiyati interest from Mohar Ali and Rahimuddin by a regis­tered kabala, Ext.7, dated 22 Poush 1311 B.S., corresponding to 5 January 1905 AD and held it as a raiyat under his father who held the superior Howla-interest, and after the death of his father, he held the raiyati right under the Howladers, namely, heirs of Ahmadullah Dewanji including himself and these facts were duly recorded in the C.S. Khatian No.140 (Ext. 21) which was prepared at a later date. Under this Khatian No.140, there were five khatians namely, Khatians Nos.141 to 145 in which the names of some bargaders of Golam Rahman were recorded. Plaintiffs' case is that by eight barga-kabuliyats those bargaders cultivated the lands for fixed periods and then handed over possession to Golam Rahman, Abdul Gani Mir, predecessor-in-interest of defendants Nos. 2 to 13, was one such bargader and he cultivated the land of C.S. Khatians Nos.141 and 142 under kabuliyat Ext. 1(b); Ahmadullah Munshi, predecessor-in-interest of defendants Nos. 13 to 14, and Jalaluddin, predecessor-in-interest of defendants Nos.37 to 41 barga-cultivated the land of C.S. Khatian No.143 under barga kabuliyats Exts. 1(c), 1(d), 1(e) and 1(f); Maniruddin, predecessor-in-interest of defen­dants Nos.29 to 34 cultivated the land in C.S. Khatian No.145 under barga kabuliyat Ext.1 (g). The area of Khatian No.140 which is the parent Khatian is 2.69 acres and it was mainly is khas possession of Golam Rahman while the area of the other four khatians is 4.64 acres. As to Khatian No.144, though it is not included in the suit land, it is relevant in this case since it was also given in barga by and returned to, Golam Rahman in the same manner. Case of the plaintiffs is that on the expiry of the terms of these Barga-kabuliyats, the bargaders surrendered their respective professions to Golam Rahman who then cultivated the land as khas, along with the land in parent Khatian No.140.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">3. Abdul Gani Mir, four years after he had surrendered his barga land, took an Osat settlement (under-raiyati) of two plots of land, Plot No.199, under Khatian No.140 and Plot No.199/1073 of Khatian No.141, from Golam Rahman by executing an Osat Raiyati kabuliyat dated 25 Sraban 1338 B.S. corres­ponding to 14 August 1931 AD for a total area of 1.08 acres at a rental of Tk. 10/- per year. He also took the land recorded in Plot No. 870 of Khatian No.141 for the purpose of cultivation on receipt of labour charge of Tk.15/- per year under a kabuliyat dated 9 Sraban 1338 B.S. corresponding to 18 August 1931 AD. Plaintiffs claimed that the lands un­der both these Kabuliyats were also surrender­ed on the expiry of their respective terms and then held in khas by Golam Rahman. As to the previous raiyats, Mohar Ali and Rahimuddin, as they had no place of residence after the sale of their occupancy raiyati by the sale-deed, Ext.7, they were permitted by Golam Rahman to reside temporarily in Plot No.365 of Khatian No.140 by raising a kutcha struc­ture; in due course Mohar Ali and Rahimuddin vacated the land.<br/><br/>4. The Touzi recording the Sikimi Taluk "Akbar Chowdhury" was put to sale in 1951 for arrears of revenue due thereupon and was purchased by the Collector in a Revenue-sale under the Bengal Land Revenue Sales Act-Act XI of 1859. The interest of Golam Rahman, an occupancy-raiyati, which was a protected interest, was not subject to annulment under section 37 of the said Act XI of 1859. But some of the defendants, namely, heirs of Ahmadullah Munshi, by fraud and collusion, got fresh settlement of the entire raiyati of Golam Rahman from the Khas Mohal Office some time in 1952 AD. These interests were, also again put to sale in auction under the Public Demands Recovery Act, 1913, and were purchased by one Makram Ali (defen­dant No.25) in 1954 and immediately after the purchase, were sold to different persons including the heirs of Ahmadullah Munshi. Case of the plaintiffs is that by the Revenue-sale their raiyati interest was not affected, that the Jamabandi on the basis of the annul­ment is void and consequently, all subsequent proceedings and actions, such as the Certifi­cate sale, followed by series of transfers from these purchasers are void. Plaintiffs claimed to have been in possession of the entire land all-through, but taking advantage of the wrong entry in the C.S. Khatians Nos.14 to 145 which had shown the bargaders as “raiyats", the defendants threatened them with dispossession. Hence they filed the suit claiming the relief’s as stated above.<br/><br/>5. The suit was contested by the heirs of two of the bargaders, namely, Abdul Gani Mir and Ahmadullah Munshi. They are defen­dants Nos. 3 and 4, sons of Abdul Gani Mir and Defendants Nos.14 to 24, heirs of Ahma­dullah Munshi; defendants Nos.26(ka) and 26(kha), who also contested the suit, are trans­ferees of defendant No.14. They filed sepa­rate written statements which are, however, mostly identical. Their case is that;<br/>(a) Their predecessors, namely, Abdul Gani Mir and Ahmadullah Munshi, were not bargaders of Golam Rahman but they were actual raiyats holding the land in raiyati interest on payment of fixed rent in kind, such as jute and paddy, and as such the C.S, khatians are correct ;<br/>(b) The purchase of the raiyati by Golam Rahman, son of Ahmadullah Dewanji in 1905 AD., was a benami transaction in that the raiyati was purchased by Ahmadullah Dewanji in the benami of his son Golam Rahman, and as such, the Howla-interest and the raiyati in­terest merged into Howla interest under section 32(1) of the Bengal Tenancy Act and consequently, it was riot a protected interest;<br/>(c) On the sale of the Touzi, the Howla-interest of Ahmadullah Dewanji from whom Golam Rahman and others inheri­ted it was annulled under section 37 of the Revenue Sales Act;<br/>(d) That the subsequent settlement (Jama-bandi) from the Government in favour of the defendants and others was per­fectly lawful and valid;<br/>(e) The auction-sale in favour of Makram Ali for arrears of rent was valid and the transfers from the auction purchaser and other connected transfers are lawful and valid;<br/>(f) They have been in possession all along.<br/><br/>6. Heirs of the other two bargaders, namely, Jalaluddin and Maniruddin, did not contest the suit or file any written statement; but an heir of Ahmadullah Munshi (Defendant No.14) claimed that the interests of Jalaluddin and Maniruddin were surrendered to him.<br/><br/>7. A number of issues were framed in the suit and were considered by the trial Court which, after hearing the parties and consider­ing evidence, both oral and documentary, decreed the suit granting all the remedies asked for except in Plot No.199 of Khatian No.140 and Plot No.199/1072 of Khatian No.141 for an area of 1.08 acres. In this area of the suit land the trial court found that the under-raiyati which was created by Golam Rahman under the Osat kabuliyat dated 8 August 1931 AD ripened into raiyati-interest on the State acquisition of rent-receiving interests. In respect of other lands, the suit was decreed by the trial court on the following findings:<br/>(i) The kabuliyats exts.1(b) to 1(f) on the basis of which the lands in khatians Nos.141, 142, 143 and 145 were posses­sed by the defendants  predecessors for fixed periods were barga-kabuliyats and that in terms of the kabuliyats the lands were surrendered on the expiry of the barga-periods to the raiyat namely, Golam Rahman;<br/>(ii) These C.S. khatians (Nos.141, 142, 143 and 145) recording the bargaders as occupancy raiyats (Raiyat-Stithiban) are palpably wrong having no basis;<br/>(iii) Golam Rahman after re-entering into these lands cultivated them in khas, brought about some changes in their character, such as some of the Nal lands were converted into homestead and a big tank was excavated in one plot;<br/>(iv) The transaction under Ext.7 that is, purchase of the occupancy-raiyati from Mohar Ali by Golam Rahman was not a benami transaction but the raiyati was purchased by Golam Rahman himself with his own money and for his own benefits and consequently, he held the land as a raiyat under the Explanation of section 22 of the Bengal Tenancy Act;<br/>(v) Consequently, Golam Rahman's interest being an occupancy-raiyati was a prote­cted interest and was not affected by the revenue sale of the Touzi in the year 1950;<br/>(vi) All subsequent proceedings taken and actions done including the Jama-bandi, Certificate-sale and transfers by She pur­chaser are null and void;<br/>(vii) In respect of Plot No. 365 of Khatian No.140, the plaintiffs were disposed by defendant No. 14 after filing of the suit but before the filing of the written statement and as such they are entitled to recovery of khas possession in respect of this plot;<br/>(viii) In the rest of the land, the plaintiffs were found in possession.<br/><br/>8. As stated in paragraph 1, the conte­sting defendants preferred an appeal before the High Court Division, and a Division Bench of the High Court Division allowed the appeal in part, reversed the decision of the trial court on some points and decreed the suit only in respect of two plots, Plots Nos. 882 and 368, though in the finding portion of the judgment they held that the plaintiffs are entitled to a decree in respect of the entire suit land "excepting khatians Nos.142 and 143". Findings of the High Court Division are the following:<br/>(i) The kabuliyats Exts, 1(b)-1(f) on the basis of which the defendant's predecessors claimed raiyati interest by settlement from Golam Rahman are in fact barga kabuliyats;<br/>(ii) that the lands were surrendered on the expiry of the terms of these kabuliyats;<br/>(iii) that the C.S. khatians are wrong and without any basis;<br/>(iv) that Golam Rahman possessed the lands in khas;<br/>(v) that Certificate sale of 195.2 is valid in respect of Khatian Nos.142 and 143 only in that in respect of Khatian Nos.140 and 145 the arrears of rent were deposited by the plaintiffs and accepted by the Certificate Officer before the sale was confirmed.<br/><br/>9. As it appears clearly, findings Nos. (i) to (iv) are concurrent and in total agree­ment with those of the trial court. But in respect of the nature of Golam Rahman's interest, whether it was a raiyati interest or a howla interest, and whether by the revenue sale of the Touzi his interest was annulled, there is no finding of the appellate Court which went straight to the subsequent certificate-sale under the Public Demands Recovery Act and held that it was valid in respect of two khatians. This impliedly shows that the appellate Court proceeded on the assumption that the revenue sale was valid. Be that as it may, in this appeal before us filed by the plaintiffs, no cross-appeal has been filed by the defendants either in respect of the concurrent findings which went against them or in respect of possession of the plaintiffs on and after the surrender.<br/><br/>10. Mr. Kh. Mahbubuddin Ahmed, learned Advocate for the appellants, has concen­trated his whole arguments on the question as to annulment of the interest of the appellants in consequence of the sale of the Touzi. He has contended that Golam Rahman, through whom the plaintiffs-appel­lants claim, by purchasing the occupancy raiyati of Meher Ali and Rahimuddin, held it as a raiyat and he did not lose this raiyati interest by subsequently inheriting his father's Howla-interest. His raiyati interest being a protected interest under section 37 of the Revenue Sales Act was not affected by the sale of the Touzi; and consequently all actions subsequent to the alleged annulment are void. In support of this argument the learned Advocate has invoked the "Explanation" to section 22(1) of the Bengal Tenancy Act. Mr. T. H. Khan, learned Advocate for the respondents, on the other hand, contends that Golam Rahman purchased the raiyati after the death of his father and as such at the time of this purchase he was a tenure-holder, that is, Howlader, having inherited his father's superior interest; consequently, the two interests were united "in the same person" whereupon he lost the raiyati and held only the Howla-interest which is not protected from annulment in the event of sale of the Touzi under section 37 of the Sales Act. The learned advocate has made strenuous efforts to make, out a case of merger of the tenure and the occupancy rai­yati within the meaning and ambit of Sub-section, (1) of section 22 of the B.T. Act, 1885. To appreciate the points involved in these two contentions section 22, B.T. Act as it stood before amendments of 1907 and 1928 is quoted below:<br/><strong>Original section (Act VIII of 1885). </strong><br/>"22. (1) When the immediate land­lord of an occupancy-holding is a pro­prietor or permanent tenure-holder, and the entire interests of the landlord and the raiyat in the holding become united in the same person by transfer, succession or otherwise, the occupancy right shall cease to exist but nothing in this sub-section shall prejudicially affect the rights of any third person.<br/>(2) If the occupancy-light inland is trans­ferred to a person jointly interested in the land as proprietor or permanent tenure-holder, it shall cease to exist; but nothing in this sub-section shall prejudicially affect the rights of any third person.<br/>(3) A person holding land as an ijaradar or farmer of rents shall not, while so holding acquire a right of occupancy in any land comprised in his ijara or farm.<br/>Explanation-A person having a right of occupancy in land does not lose it by subsequently becoming jointly inter­ested in the land as proprietor or permanent tenure-holder, or by subsequently holding the land in ijara or farm.<br/>Sale of a revenue paying estate for the recovery of arrear of revenue is governed by the Bengal Laud Revenue Sales Act XI of 1859 and section 37 thereof provides the right of the   purchaser of such an estate including the right to annul all encumbrances. Section 37 is, therefore, quoted below for appreciation of the consequences of a revenue sale.<br/>"37. The purchaser of an entire estate in the permanently-settled districts of Bengal, (Bihar and Orissa), sold under this Act for the recovery of arrears due on account of the same shall acquire the estate free from all encumbrances which may have been imposed upon it after the time of settlement; and shall be entitled to avoid and annul all under-tenures and forthwith to eject all under-­tenants, with the following exceptions:-<br/>First —Istimrari or mukarrari tenures which have been held at a fixed rent from the time of the permanent settlement.<br/>Secondly.—Tenures existing at the time of settlement which have not been held at a fixed rent:<br/>Thirdly.—Talukdari and other similar tenures created since the time of settlement and held immediately by the proprietors of estates and farms for terms of years held, when such tenures and farms have been duly registered under the provi­sions of this Act.<br/>Fourthly.- Leases of lands whereon dwelling-houses, manufactories or other perma­nent buildings have been erected, or whereon gardens, plantations, tanks, wells, cabals, places of worship or bur­ning or burying grounds have been made wherein mines have been, sunk.<br/>Provided always that nothing in this section contained, shall be construed to entitle any such purchaser as aforesaid to eject any raiyat having a right of occupancy at a fixed rent or at a rent assessable according to fixed rules under the laws in force or to enhance the rent of any such raiyat otherwise than in the manner prescribed by such laws, or otherwise than the former proprietor irrespective of all engagements made since the time of settlement, may have been entitled to do,"<br/><br/>11. As it appears clearly an occupancy right is not an encumbrance but is a protected interest and remains unaffected by the sale of its superior interest. Now the question is whether the occupancy-raiyati purchased by Golam Rahman, the appellants' predecessor, was merged in the Howla interest under sub-section (1) of section 22, B.T. Act or it continued in existence as raiyati under the Explanation to that section 22 particularly, sub-section (1) introduces the "doctrine of merger” of an estate or tenure with a raiyati interest in the same person resulting in total extinguish­ment of the raiyati. Here complete merger is effected as the entire interest of the proprietor/permanent tenure-holder and the entire inter­est of the raiyati unite in the same person. Sub-section (2) provides for partial merger which takes place if a co-sharer landlord ac­quires the raiyati interest under him and his other co-sharer landlords. As to sub-section (3), it prohibits an ijaradar or revenue farmer from acquiring any occupancy right and as such it is not attracted in the instant case. But the “Explanation” to this section is of fundamental importance in that it operates as an exception to the general principle of merger in sub-sections (1) and (2). It provides that if an occupancy raiyat acquires a share in the superior interest, that is, an estate or a per­manent tenure, he shall not lose the raiyati" interest. The doctrine of merger, under which the occupancy right disappears, is based on the common-sense principle that a person cannot be, at the same time, both landlord and tenant of the same premises. This has been explained in Woodfall's Landlord and Tenant, page 326 in the following words:<br/>"Whenever the particular estate and that immediately in reversion are both legal and both equitable, and by any act or event subsequent to the creation of the particular estate, becomes, for the first time, vested in one person in the same right, separate existence will cease, and a merger will take place."<br/>In the case of a merger, it is clear, the land­lord holds only the superior interest; he cannot possess the land in khas. To give a co-sharer landlord right to hold the land in khas as well this section was amended first in 1907 and then in 1928. By the amendment of 1907, in sub-section (1) the phrase "the occupancy right shall cease to exist" was replaced by the phrase "such person shall have no right to hold the land as raiyat but shall hold it as a proprietor or permanent tenure-holder". And as to sub-section (2), it was so amended as to enable a co-sharer landlord, if he acquires the occupancy right, to hold the land in khas on payment of rent to his co-sharer-landlords "for use and occupation of the same". But so far as the Exception is concerned, it has remained unaltered all through as a result, a person holding occu­pancy right in a land does not lose it by sub­sequently becoming jointly interested in the land as proprietor or permanent tenure-holder. The difference between sub-section (1) and the Explanation is that in the former the landlord acquires the raiyati but the raiyat holding disappears and in the latter a raiyat acquires a share in the superior interest but retains his raiyati interest.<br/><br/>12. Mr. T.H. Khan learned Advocate for the respondents, in order to bring the case within sub-section (1) of section 22 contends that the occupancy raiyat was purchased by Golam Rahman after the death of his father Ahmadullah Dewanji; that is to say, when Golam Rahman already inherited his father's Howla interest and became a tenure-holder. But the date of death of Golam Rahman's father was never an issue in this suit, on the contrary, the whole case of the defendants was built upon their contention raised in then written statement that Golam Rahman's father had purchased the raiyati in the benami of his son. Evidence was led by them in support of the contention that the transaction was a benami purchase by Ahmadullah Dewanji in the name of his son Golam Rahman. But this contention was rejected and it was held that the transaction was not a benami tran­saction but the raiyati was purchased by Golam Rahman with his own money and for his own interest. The best among the evidence led in this connection by the plaintiffs was the deposition of Ahmadullah Dewanji himself in another suit—T.S. No. 240 of 1907, (Ext.18). In that suit also the question of benami nature of this sale under the kabala, Ext.7, was raised and in that suit Ahmadullah Dewanji deposed as a witness stating that his son had purchased the raiyati. Now at the fag end of the day, the new contention has been raised that Golam Rahman's father was dead when the raiyati was purchased. This contention is inconsistent with the earlier contention taken in the trial court that Ahmadullah Dewanji purchased the land in benami of his son. We have no hesitation to reject this contention and we accept as correct the finding that the acquisition of the occupancy raiyati under Ext.7 in the year 1905 fell into the Explanation to section 2 before its amendment.<br/><br/>13. Mr. T.H. Khan has next made feeble attempts to reopen the question as to the Barga kabuliyats Exts.1 (b) to 1(f) contending that though they are styled Barga kabuliyats, their contents show that occupancy rights or raiyati interests were created in favour of the respondent's predecessors. It has already been pointed out that this is a con­current finding of both the trial court and the appellate Court that these kabuliyats were barga kabuliyats and not kabuliyats creating any tenancy right and that on the expiry of the terms of these kabuliyats the lands were surrendered to the owner. We have considered the evidence in this connection and we find that the kabuliyats were for fixed per­iods of time varying from 4 years to nine years; in three cases, kabuliyats Exts.1(c) 1(g), 1(j), the first terms of four years were extended for further periods of five years. In all these kabuliyats it was stipulated that on the expiry of the terms of the kabuliyats the executants would be bound to hand over possession to the owner, Golam Rahman. We also find evidence of overt acts of possession of Golam Rahman after the surrender, such as conver­sion of two Nal lands into homestead land and excavation of a big tank in one plot of land in respect of which both oral and docu­mentary evidence including payment of labour cost has been led. Above all, in the two subsequent kabuliyats Ext.1 dated 14-8-31 AD and Ext. 2 dated 18-8-31 AD, Abul Gani Mir while taking Osat settlement under the former and right of cultivation against receipt of labour charge under the latter, clearly and unequivocally admitted Golam Rahman as owner in raiyati right. In respect of the Osat kabuliyat, Mr. T.H. Khan has tried to argue that the land thereunder relates to the khas land of Golam Rahman in Khatian No.140 This contention is correct only in the case of Plot No.199 measuring 53 acres of Khatian No.140, but it is not correct in the case of Plot No.199/073 of Khatian No.141 which was covered by Abdul Gani Mir's previous barga kabuliyats Ext. 1(b). If the land under the kabuliyat Fxt.1  (b) had been already settled to him in raiyati right in the year 1916 why he would again take Osat settlement (under raiyati) in the year 1931 AD? Mr. T.H. Khan contends that mere title “barga” of the kabuliyat is not sufficient to draw an inference in favour of a barga settlement, and that determination of the issue depends on proper construction of the document. We have considered this contention and find that excepting the stipulation for payment of fixed quantities of paddy and jute for use and occupation of the land all other ingredients indicate a barga settlement. As to the position of a bargader, he has been excluded from the Definition of a tenant under section 3(17) of the Bengal Tenancy Act, 1885. This definition has remained unaltered all-through. Under this section the bargader or Adhiar is not a tenant, but he acquires the status of a tenant only in two circumstances; if he is admitted as a tenant by the landlord in any document executed by him or exected in his favour and accepted by him, or if he has been held by a civil court to be a tenant. Neither of these two requirements has been fulfilled in the case of the respondent's predecessors. Moreover, these kabuliyats were executed aro­und 1320 B.S. corresponding to 1914 AD. Had occupancy rights been created thereunder, these rights would not have been annulled in consequence of the sale of the Touzi in 1950. Taking fresh settlement by the respon­dents from the Government in the wake of the revenue-sale goes to show that the kabuli­yats did not give them any occupancy right.<br/><br/>14.
