No. 2 19 of 2002).<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"> <br/><strong>Judgment</strong></span></div><strong>                 </strong><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mohammad Fazlul Karim J.-</strong> This Appeal, by leave, is directed against the judgment and order dated 03.08.2004 passed by the High Court Division in First Appeal No.219 of 2003 allowing the appeal setting aside the judgment and decree dated 20.02.2003 passed by the Joint District Judge, 1st Court, Dhaka in Title Suit No. 99 of 1999 decreeing the same.<br/><br/>2. The facts of the case, in short, are that the plaintiff appellant instituted Title Suit No.99 of 1999 for declaration that the suit property is his personal property and that the suit property is not a play ground or an open field or a water reservior/river and also for declaring memo dated 06.04.1999 issued by the defendant No.1 Rajdhani Unnayan Katripakkhya in short RAJUK as illegal, without jurisdiction and not binding upon the plaintiff.<br/><br/>3. In the plaint it was asserted, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit land belonged to Israt Reba Mohammad Zunaid and  Shamim Ara Rafique who proposed to sell the property to   the plaintiff and accordingly on 05.10.1991 an agreement was executed between the parties and subsequently, the executors refusing to executed the deed of sale the plaintiff appellant filed Title Suit No.46 of 1997 for Specific Performance of Contract and the suit being decreed, in Execution Case No.1 of 1998 a deed of sale was executed and registered in favour of the plaintiff who thereafter mutated his name in the Government sheresta and paid rents to the Government and in order to construct a multi-storied building on the suit land applied to the RAJUK and RAJUK by memo dated 25.03.1998 approved the plan and erected boundary wall, raised earth and made pilling works and got electricity connection and stored construction materials in the suit property and advanced huge amount for supplying construction materials and the plaintiff on 24.01.1999 entered into an agreement with the Entrium Real Estate for making construction on the suit land and in terms of the agreement the Real Estate invested TK.30,00,000.00 for making the construc­tion and while the plaintiff through devel­oper was starting construction he was sur­prised to receive memo, dated 06:04.1999 from RAJUK withdrawing the approval of the plan and directing him to take the amount deposited by him for approval of the plan alleging that the suit property was open field, water reservoir and river. The plaintiff then requested the defendant No.1 RAJUK to revoke the aforesaid memo dated 06.04.1999 but to no effect and hence filed the suit and that during pendency of the suit the defendant No.1 dispossessed the plaintiff and took forcible possession and as such, the plaint was amended adding a prayer for recovery of khas possession of the suit land.<br/><br/>4. The defendant No.1 contested the suit filing written-statement contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit plot was acquired in L.A. Case Nos. 55 of 58-59 and 10 of 63-64 and is part of Gulshan Lake and that Bangladesh Environment Ainjibi Samity filed Writ Petition No.2482 of 1998 wherein an ad-interim order was passed putting restriction on filing the lake by raising earth and the Manager of the plain­tiff appellant was shown the aforesaid order of the Court and was requested not to proceed with the filling works and the Manager gave an undertaking not to pro­ceed with any further work and that the land being acquired land of RAJUK the plaintiff had no right, title and interest therein and thus, had no locus standi to file the suit.<br/><br/>5. The learned trial Court after hearing the parties decreed the suit making, amongst others, the following findings; that after de-requisition, the original owner of the suit land got back the same; that the suit land is private property of the plaintiff and had never been part of lake; that the defen­dant approved the plan in due course but subsequently, without giving any notice withdraw the same which is violative of the principle of natural justice; that as the suit land not being the part of the lake the order passed in Writ Petition No. 2482 of 1998 is not enforceable in respect of the suit land and accordingly, decreed the suit by judgment and decreed dated 20.02.2003.<br/>6. Against the aforesaid judgment and decree the defendant respondent No.1 preferred First Appeal No.219 of 2003 before the High Court Division and the High Court Division by the impugned judgment and order allowed the appeal as already mentioned above.<br/><br/>7. Hence, is this appeal.<br/><br/>8. Leave was granted to consider the sub­mission of the learned Counsel for the appellant that "In view of the Sections 15, 17 of the Building Construction Act, 1952 and Section 169 of the Town Improvement Act, 1953 we find that the impugned judg­ment and decree passed by the trial Court suffers from gross illegality and not sustainable in the eye of law; that the issuance of impugned memo dated 06.04.1999 being not an act done under the provision of Town Improvement Act, 1953 or any rules or regulations made thereunder the notice as contemplated in Section 169 of the said Act is not required to be served before filling suit against RAJUK and as such, the High Court Division erred in dismissing the suit hold­ing that the suit is bad for lack of notice under Section 169 of the Town Improvement Act, 1953; that withdrawal of the sanction by the impugned memo not for breach of any terms or condition or for making incorrect statement but the same was issued in compliance of direction of the office of the Prime Minister which cannot be held to be an exercise of Power under Section 9 of the Building Construction Act, and as such, the mis­chief of Section 14 of the Building Construction Act, 1952 does not attract the instant suit land therefore, the High Court Division erred in law in setting aside the decree of the trial Court holding the suit as not maintainable; that impugned memo dated 06.04.1999 is <em>ex facie</em>, illegal and without jurisdiction and has not been issued in exercise of power under Section 9 of the Building Construction Act, and the same is violation of principle of natu­ral justice as held by the trial Court, the High Court Division erred in law in allow­ing the appeal; that having found title of the plaintiff to the suit land and admitted­ly, the defendant took forcible possession of the suit land, the High Court Division erred in law in not maintaining the decree so far as it relates to declaration of title and recovery of possession."<br/><br/>9. Khondker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, learned Counsel, appearing for the appellant submitted that issuance of impugned memo dated 06.04.1999 being not an act done under the provision of Town Improvement Act, 1953 or any rules or regulations made thereunder, notice as contemplated in Section 169 of the said Act is not required to be served before fill­ing suit against RAJUK and, as such, the High Court Division erred in dismissing the suit holding that the suit is bad for want of notice under Section 169 of the Town Improvement Act, 1953; that with­drawal of sanction of plan by the impugned memo not for breach of any terms and conditions nor for making incorrect statement but in compliance of direction of the office of the Prime Minister cannot be held to be an exercise of power under Section 9 of the Building Construction Act, 1952 and as such, the suit does not fall within the mischief of Section 14 of the Building Construction Act, 7952 and the High Court Division erred in law in setting aside the decree of the trial Court holding the suit as not maintainable; that the impugned memo dated 06.04.1999 being <em>ex-facie</em>, illegal and without jurisdiction as not issued in exercise of power under Section 9 of the Building Construction Act, 1952 and the same being in violation of principle of nat­ural justice, the High Court Division erred in law in allowing the appeal. The learned Counsel finally submitted that having found title of the plaintiff to the suit land and the defendant having admittedly taken forcible possession of the suit land, the High Court Division erred in law in not maintaining the decree passed by the trial Court.<br/><br/>10. A.K.M. Nazrul Islam, learned Advocate, appearing for the respondent No.1 submitted that admittedly the suit land was acquired in L.A. Case No.55 of 7958-59 and L.A. Case No.10 of 1963-64 as part of Gulshan Lake and the respon­dent No.1 was empowered in law to can­cel the plan of the plaintiff appellant under Section 9 of the Building Construction Act, 1952 inasmuch as that is the only pro­vision that has been provided in the Act enabling the cancellation only on the ground provided therein, <em>inter alia</em>, for any civil or non-compliance of the provision of the Act. The learned Advocate further submitted that Section 3 of the Building Construction Act, 1952 empowered RAJUK to allow plan to construct or re­construct or to make addition or alteration to any building or excavate or re-excavate providing mandatory provision for such purpose sanctioned of the authorized offi­cer inasmuch as the said authority had also power to cancel or otherwise. The learned Advocate further submitted that the Section 14 of the Building Construction Act, 1952 read with Sections 3, 3A, 3B, 4, 5, 6 and 9 thereof bars civil suit against any order passed by the authority under the Act inasmuch as the selfsame con­tained for the purpose has provided the forum of appeal which the appellant has not availed. The learned Advocate lastly submitted that in a series of decisions by the High Court Division particularly in C.P.L.A. No. 588 of 2000 this Court has directed RAJUK to preserved the lake thereto maintained road and walk way with a reasonable slop around the lake for the use of the public and should also acquire in the public interest land if required for the purpose for maintenance and preserve the lake with road and walk way etc and not to approve any plan what­soever covered by lake.<br/><br/>11. Admittedly the suit land was acquired in L.A. Case No. 55 of 1958-59 and 10 of 1963-64 forming a part of Gulshan Lake and the said lake has also been shown in the said plan of the Gulshan area which is required to be preserved and protected in the public interest. Furthermore, any devi­ation of the said acquired land by way of any construction on plan allegedly sanc­tioned by the authority is liable to be can­celled under the provision of Section 9 of the Building Construction Act, 1952 inas­much as even if the grounds may not be covered by the said provision the said pro­vision is only enabling providing for can­cellation of any sanction plan on any cogent ground apart from them mentioned in the sanction.<br/><br/>12. The Act has provided an ouster of jurisdiction of the Civil Court under the provision of Section 14 of the Building Construction Act, which is bar to main­tain any suit against the order passed by RAJUK under the Act providing provision for an appeal therein. In the instant case the appellant has not availed the said pro­vision of appeal instead filed the suit which is not maintainable as the special provision provides a special remedy for the purpose and the person being the satis­fied with any order of RAJUK could pre­fer appeal in the special forum for the pur­pose.<br/><br/>13. In spite of the fact that the disputed land is apart of Gulshan lake but the writ petitioner applied for approval of a plan in order to make building but RAJUK though inadvertence approved the plan and subsequently realizing the same, RAJUK   cancelled  the  plan. RAJUK, accordingly dispossessed the writ peti­tioner from the suit land upon issuance of the impugned notice cancelling the approval of the plan; that later on the plaintiff filed a petition to the appellant for restoration of the plan. The appellant filed the suit in the Civil Court in spite of the provision of appeal under the Building Construction Act, 1952 which the appel­lant did not avail. In his cross examination the appellant has admitted that he did not prefer any appeal. Further in sub-section 2 of Section 17 of the Act it has been clear­ly enacted that no such, prosecution or legal proceeding shall lie against any per­son in respect of anything which in good faith done or intended to be done under this Act. By this enactment, the legislature has ousted the jurisdiction of the Civil Court from interfering or calling in ques­tion of any order passed by the appellant under the aforesaid Act. Thus, the Civil Court's Jurisdiction has been specifically ousted by the concerned Act governing the subject.<br/><br/>14. The Building Construction Act, 1952 provides in Section 3 authorizing RAJUK to allow plan for construction or re-con­struction, addition or alteration to any building or excavate or re-excavate pro­vides sanction for the purpose by the authorized officer and under the provision of General Clauses Act as well a person who is empowered to grant would in its inherent power revoke or withdraw the same.<br/><br/>15. This Court considering the public interest and the convenience and incon­venience of the people in the vicinity has long before pronounced in unequivocal terms in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 386 of 2000 is the case of <strong><em>Prof. Dr. Niaz  Zaman Vs. Rajdhani Unnayan Kartipakkhya and others</em></strong> directing RAJUK to preserve the lake maintaining road and walkway with reasonable slop around the lake for the purpose and directed RAJUK as well, to acquire any land in the vicinity in the public interest for maintaining and preserving the lake, road and walk way with reasonable slop to the water and further directed not to approve any building plan in the area covered by lake.<br/><br/>16. In the said decisions this Court further held that "In order to prevent private encroachment in the lake area a direction is required to be made upon RAJUK not to approve any building plan in the area covered by lake including the area proposed to be acquired for preserving the lake. That a layout plan has already been prepared by RAJUK for the existing Gulshan, Baridhara lake and the plots and lands adjacent to the lake. In the said layout plan all the existing and proposed roads and walkway alignments have been delineated and depicted using different colours. The cross section of the lake has been shown also in the said layout. It has been proposed that the slanted space (greenery) in between the lake and the walkway will be used for preserving the navigability and depth of the lake and the proposed road and walkway will be constructed on the boundary wall of the duly allotted plots. That the area marked under red hatching in the layout plan of Gulshan Baridhara lake and its side land is not in existence as part of the lake and is intended to be acquired and preserved as part of the lake, The signed statements dated 14tn January, 2003 and 25th January, 2003 and the layout plan No.TP/RLT/234/APRIL-3 (53) dated 4<sup>th</sup> April, 1994 have been made Annexure-A, B and C respectively and prayed for forming part of the additional paper book filed in this Court.<br/>Annexure- A as referred to above is quoted below as under;<br/>“বিষয়ঃ গুলশান ও বারিধারা লেক ও পার্শ্বব্ররতী ভুমির লে- আউট প্ল্যন প্রসঙ্গে ।<br/>গুলশান ও বারিধারার বিদ্যমান লেক পার্শ্ববর্তী প্লট ও জমি সহ একটি লে-আউত প্ল্যান প্রনয়ন করা হইয়াছে ।<br/>০১। লে-আউট এ বিদ্যমান ও প্রস্তাবিত সড়ক এবং walkway এলাইমেন্ট ভিন্ন ভিন্ন রঙ দ্বারা চিহ্নিত করা হইয়াছে ।<br/>০২। লে-আউট প্ল্যানে লেকের cross section দেখান হইয়াছে ।<br/>০৩। Walk Way  and  Open  Space (Greenery) এর পর থেকে লেকের পার্শ্ববর্তী ভুমির Slops ১:২ অনুপাতে লেকের নাব্যতা সংরক্ষন করার ব্যবস্থা গ্রহন করা হইবে। প্রস্তাবিত সড়ক ও walkway বরাদ্দকৃত প্লট বাউন্ডারী পার্শ্ব দিয়া নিরমানের প্রস্তাব করা হইয়াছে । <br/>Annexure- B as referred to above is quoted below as under;<br/>বিষয়ঃ গুলশান ও বারিধারা লেক ও পার্শ্বব্ররতী ভুমির লে- আউট প্ল্যন প্রসঙ্গে ।<br/>নকশায় চিহ্নিত Red hatching বরতমানে লেকের অংশ হিসাবে সরেজমিনে আছে । <br/><br/>17. Annexure-C as referred to above is the layout plan of lake and side-land in between Gulshan and Baridhara being drawing No.TP/RLT/234 /APRIL-3(53) dated 4th April, 1994." <br/>"But since this petition is also by way of public interest litigation and accordingly, this Division gave direc­tions to RAJUK to clarify the status of the land proposed to be acquired and for preparing a layout plan depicting the proposed road around the Gulshan and Baridhara lake and walkway with slops which must be constructed and maintained by the side of the bound­ary wall of the adjacent allottees. RAJUK has stated the land within the red hatching in the layout plan of Gulshan Baridhara lake filed by RAJUK in its additional paper book together with the layout plan etc. showing its side land now in existence as part of the lake is intended to be acquired expeditiously and preserved as part of the lake. Preservation of the lake and to maintain a road and walk­way with reasonable slop around the lake is a public purpose and accord­ingly, this Division directs that with that end in view the land inside the periphery of the lake should be acquired in the public interest as early as possible and the same should be maintained in a similar manner for preserving the lake with a road and walkway with reasonable slop towards water. This Division, accord­ingly, further gives the direction to the RAJUK for implementation of its aforesaid directions as soon as possi­ble."<br/><br/>18. In view of the above, we find no merit in the submissions of the learned Counsel for the appellant.<br/>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed without any order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
