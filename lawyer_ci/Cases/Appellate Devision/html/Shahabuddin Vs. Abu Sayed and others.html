Application for amendment of the plaint having been rejected the plaintiff obtained a Rule from the High Court Division in civil revision. The Rule was made absolute on 14.8.84 allowing the plaintiff's prayer. The records of the case reached the trial Court on 25.1.86, but the plaintiff failed to file any <em>hajira</em> nor took any steps. On 16.3.86 the plaintiff was directed to file deficit court fee by 4.4.86. The plaintiff having failed to do so the plaint was rejected by order dated 5.4.86.<br/><br/>2. On 18.4.87 the plaintiff filed an application under section 151 CPC for vacating the order dated 5.4.86 and for restoring the suit to file on the ground that owing to the LC records being misplaced and owing to the plaintiff's own indisposition, he could not take steps after 25.1.86 and the order of rejection of the plaint was passed without his knowledge. By order dated 11.5.87, the trial Court, although unable to take any firm decision as to the plaintiff s pleas, vacated the order dated 5.4.86 and restored the suit to its file on payment of Tk. 1000.00 as costs to defendant No, 1.<br/><br/>3. Defendant No. 1 unsuccessfully took a revision before the High Court Division, which took the view that the prayer of the plaintiff was allowed on proper appreciation of the matter on record.<br/><br/>4. Defendant No. 1 now seeks leave to appeal from the Judgment of the High Court Division.<br/><br/>5. Mr. Sultan Ahmad, learned Advocate for the petitioner, submits that the learned Subordinate Judge as well as the High Court Division erred in law in not considering that rejection of the plaint being a decree, an appeal was available to the plaintiff and that the application under section 151 CPC did not lie.<br/><br/>6. The suit was filed on 13.11.74 and it had a chequered career. When the case records reached the trial Court on 25.1.86, the plaintiff was not available and it appears that all subsequent orders were passed by the court in the absence of the plaintiff including the order of rejection of the plaint dated 5.4.86. The trial Court did not reject the plaintiff’s plea that the case records remained untraced for some time. In these circumstances the restoration of the suit in exercise of the Court's inherent power under section 151 CPC was not unjustified.<br/><br/>7. Mr. Zakir Hossain, learned Advocate entering <em>caveat </em>on behalf of the plaintiff respondents, has filed a certified copy of the entire order sheet of the trial Court. We find therein that the suit has again been dismissed for default of the plaintiff and the defendants by order dated 17.3.91.<br/><br/>8. This Judgment will have no bearing on the trial Courts latest order dated 17.3.91.            <br/><br/>As, however, we find no ground for interference with the judgment of the High Court Division, the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
