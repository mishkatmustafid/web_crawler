Ruhul Amin J. -</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the Judgment and order dated 05.03.2005 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.3195 of 1998 making the Rule absolute. <br/>2. Short facts are that the plaintiffs instituted Title Suit No. 269 of 1966 in the Court of Munsif(now Assistant Judge), Borolekha, Moulvibazar impleading one Abdul Huque the predecessor in interest of the present petitioners as defendants and opposite party Nos.3-27 and others raying for a decree for declaration of title and recovery of khas possession in the suit land as described in the schedule to the plaint stating,  <em>inter alia</em>, that two full mothers, namely, Firoz Ali and Hasan Ali were owners of the suit land. Hasan Ali transferred his share in favour of his brother Firoz Ali by a registered kabala dated 8th Sraban, 1330 B.S. and shifted to his father-in-law's house at Shafarpur and died there leaving behind two sons as heirs through his two wives. The defen­dant No.1 who is son of Hasan Ali through his first wife, finding himself in difficulty in living with his step brothers and sisters obtained permission from Firoj Ali to live with him as a licensee and accordingly defendant No.1 by erecting a hut has been residing in Plot No.2 of the suit land as a licensee. The further case of the plaintiff is that the defendant No.1 used to look after all the affairs of Firoj Ali and taking advantage there of the defendant No.1 got his name recorded in the Khatian and sub­sequently when the plaintiffs who are sons of Firoj Ali directed the defendant No.1 to vacate the suit land, the latter refused and hence is the suit.<br/>3. The defendants contested the suit by fil­ing written statement denying the material allegations made in the plaint. Their case is that the defendant No.1 was never a licensee in the suit land under Firoj Ali but he had been possessing the suit land for long over 35 years and acquired title by adverse possession. Their further case is that the suit land originally belonged to two brothers, namely, Hamid Ali and Maidar Ali and by amicable partition Hamid Ali was residing on the southern half portion and Hamid Ali died leaving behind three sons in Joyed Ali, Khorshed Ali and Wasid Ali. Hasan Ali transferred his share in favour of the Firoj Ali in 1330 B.S. Firoj Ali subsequently purchased the share of Joyed Ali and he is residing on his purchased property for over 40 years. The further case is that due to good relation­ship no formal kabala was executed by Joyed Ali and others in favour of Hasan Ali and record of right was correctly pre­pared. So the suit is liable to fail.<br/>4. The trial court decreed the suit. On appeal in Title Appeal No.125 of 1986, the court of appeal dismissed the appeal and affirmed the judgment and decree of the trial court. Being aggrieved the defendants moved the High Court Division and obtained the Rule which was made absolute.<br/>5. We have heard Mahbubey Alam, the learned Counsel for the petitioner and Abdur Razzak, the learned Counsel for the respondent Nos.1 and 3 and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/>6. The High Court Division held that from the evidence on record it is clear that defendant Abdul Haque resided in the suit land for over 35 years and he was brought up by Firoj Ali from his boyhood and was given in marriage by Firoz Ali and after his death his heirs, the present defendants have been residing in the suit land and that Abdul Haque constructed dwelling hut in the suit homestead. The High Court Division further held that it has not been proved that Abdul Haque was a licensee under Firoj Ali. The High Court Division also held that it is the case of plaintiff that the defendant No.1 raised hut on the suit land and on local inspection by the Advocate Commissioner he also found so and no objection was raised by the plain­tiff against such construction of hut by the defendants.<br/>7. Therefore, the findings  of the High Court Division that the nature of license was not proved by the plaintiff and in the facts and circumstances of the case, the defendant No.1, if a licensee at all, could not be asked to vacate the suit land with­out revoking the license.<br/>8. In view of the discussions made above, we are of view that the High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision. There is no cogent reason to interfere with the same.<br/>Accordingly, the leave petition is dis­missed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
