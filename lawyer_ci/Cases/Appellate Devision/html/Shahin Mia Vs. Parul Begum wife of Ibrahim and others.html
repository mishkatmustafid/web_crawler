K. Das J. -</strong> This application for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 11.5.09 of a learned Single Judge of the High Court Division making the rule being Civil Revision No. 157 of 2003 absolute and thereby setting aside the judgment and decree of the courts below and decreeing the suit in favour of the plaintiff.<br/><br/>2. The respondent Nos.1-8 as plaintiffs instituted Title Suit No. 18 of 1997 in the court of Senior Assistant Judge, Kasba, Brahmanbaria, impleading the present petitioner as defendants and respondent Nos.9-22 as other defendant and respon­dent No.23 as Proforma defendant, pray­ing for declaration of title to the suit land and for recovery of <em>Khas</em> possession there­in alleging, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit plot No. 638 and 639 along with on non suited plot no. 643 measuring 39 decimals of land originally belonged to Samena Bibi which was finally published in her name in C.S. Khatian and that the said Samena Bibi died leaving behind her only daughter Amena Khatun and thereafter Amena Khatun died leaving behind her daughter Malekernessa alias Melaka. While Melaka was owning and possessing the said plots she transferred the entire land of plot No. 643 by executing and registering deed of sale No.3219 dated 26.4.62 and 07 deci­mals of land from the suit plots by execut­ing and registering another deed of sale bearing No. 4967 dated 6.12.72 to the plaintiff No. 4 Abdul Sobhan alias Sobhan Miah. After purchase he mutated his name and got <em>Jama</em> separated in separation case No. 22483-84 by creating a separate <em>Khatian</em> No. 982 and took a loan from the Janata Bank, Brahmanbaria branch by mortgaging the said 07 decimals of land. Thereafter  Maleka Begum died leaving behind one son Abdul Hossain, father of plaintiff No. 5, who died leaving behind plaintiff Nos. 3-5 as his sons and daughter and thus the plaintiff Nos. 1-4 became the owners of .27 decimals of land in the suit plot by way of purchase and by inheri­tance. It is further stated that in S.A. oper­ation the suit property along with the property of plot No.643 has been wrongly recorded in the name of one Aderjaman and other, predecessors of the defendants in khatian No.117. The plaintiff learnt about the wrong record in the S.A. khat­ian on the basis of so-called partition suit No.172 of 1929. The defendant no. 5 with the help of other defendants forcibly entered into the land of plot No. 638 on 30.9.96 and constructed two <em>dochala</em> tin shed and 3 <em>chouchala</em> tin shed defying the objection raised by plaintiff No.3.<br/><br/>3. The defendant no. 5 contested the suit by filing a written statement contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit is barred by limita­tion and that the suit plot no. 638 and 639 along with non suited plot no. 643 meas­uring an area of .39 decimals of land belonged to Samena Bibi and her name was rightly recorded in C.S. Khatian. Samena Khatun subsequently defaulted to pay rents and the Talukder was going to file a suit for realization of rent when Samena Bibi executed Istafanama deed dated 06.06.1920 and surrendered the property in favour of the landlord who set­tled the property to Munshi Mia son of Nawaj Ali on 10.09.1921 and thus Munshi Sheikh became the sole owner of the land of the said 3 plots and has been in posses­sion of the said land and prayed for dis­missal of the suit.<br/><br/>4. The Trial Court took necessary evi­dence both oral and documentary and on hearing the parties by the impugned judg­ment and decree dated 19.04.49 dismissed the suit.<br/><br/>5. Being aggrieved thereby the plaintiff preferred Title Appeal No. 74 of 1999 before the learned District Judge, Brahmanbaria, and that the 1st Court of the Additional District Judge, Brahmanbaria by judgment and decree dated 23.7.2002 dismissed the appeal and affirmed the decision of the trial Court.<br/><br/>6. Being aggrieved thereby the plaintiff as petitioner moved the High Court Division in Civil Revision no. 57 of 2003 and the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division upon hearing the parties made the rule absolute, set aside the judgment and decree of the courts below and decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiff.<br/><br/>7. Being aggrieved thereby the defendant as petitioner filed the instant petition seeking leave to appeal before the Appellate Division, Mr. Sharder Abul Hossain, the learned Advocate appears with the leave of the court for the petitioner while Mr. Mazibur Rahman, the learned-on-record appears on behalf the of respondent nos. 1-4 and 7.<br/><br/>8. We have heard the submissions of the learned Advocates for both the parties and perused the impugned judgment and all other evidence on record. The learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that the High Court Division committed an error of law in disturbing the findings of facts arrived at by both the Courts below and on misreading of the evidence on record committed an error of law in hold­ing that the plaintiffs did not mention the date of cause of action and the date of dis­possession and also gave perverse finding upon non-consideration of the findings of facts recorded by the lower appellate Court. The learned Advocate further sub­mits that the learned judge of the High Court Division committed an error of law in holding that the suit is barred by limita­tion and also in finding that the plaintiffs did not adduce any direct evidence to prove alleged dispossession.<br/><br/>9. The grounds and submissions appear to have merit.<br/>Accordingly, leave is granted.<br/>Security of Tk.1,000/- is to be deposit­ed within 1 (one) month.<br/>The petitioners are permitted to pre­pare the paper book out of court in accor­dance with the Rules.<br/>The order of stay granted earlier by this Division shall continue till disposal of the appeal.<br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
