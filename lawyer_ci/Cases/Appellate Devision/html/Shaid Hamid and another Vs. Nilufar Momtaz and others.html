In such situation, after rejection of the plaint, the writ-petitioner had no efficacious remedy to protect her possession in the flat and accordingly, she had to move the High Court Division and obtained the Rule. The High Court Division held that in the circumstance, writ petition cannot be said to be not maintainable in order to determine the legality of the impugned letter dated 06.06.2006. For the reasons aforesaid, the impugned letter dated 06.06.2006 must be held to have been issued in excess of the powers of the writ-respondent No.6 and therefore, cannot be sustained in law and accordingly, declared to have been issued without any lawful authority and of no legal effect. ..(6)</strong></div> <br/><em><strong>Lawyers Involved:</strong></em><br/><em>Rafique-ul  Huq, Senior Advocate instructed by Mrs. Sufia Khatun, Advocate-on-Record- For the Petitioners.</em><br/><em>Abul Kalam Mainuddin, Advocate, instructed by Chowdhury Md.

The facts of the case, in short, are that the respondent No.1 and the petitioner, Shaid Hamid, were married on 19.02.1999. During the subsistence of marriage, petitioner on 11.03.2005 made oral gift of flat A-4(4th Floor) of House No.188, Road No.2 at DOHS at Mohakhali in Dhaka in favour of the respondent No.1 and on 21.03.2005 also made a declaration on such oral gift, which was duly notarized. The present petitioner handed over possession of the flat to the respondent No.1 on the date of gift. Having accepted the gift,   the respondent No.1 possessed the same. The respondent No.1 then rented out the flat to one Rezanul Kabir by a monthly deed of agreement executed on 01.04.2005. Thereafter, the present petitioner on 30.04.2005 made an application to the office of respondent No.6, the Military Estate Officer, for mutation of the flat in the name of the respondent No.1. The Respondent No.1 also on the same date made an application for mutation of the said flat on the basis of gift in her name.<br/><br/>3. Upon receipt of the application, respondent No.6 wrote a letter asking the petitioner for furnishing certain information to which the petitioner did not respond. On 16.02.2006 the respondent No.1 filed another application for mutation. Thereafter, the said respondent No.6 by his letter dated 26.02.2006 informed the respondent No.1, <em>inter alia, </em>that as there was existence of two gifts of the same property and an affidavit was filed canceling the gift in faovur of the respondent No.1 that in view of the objection of the donor and that in the absence of proof of absolute title thereon, it was not possible to order mutation. The office has got no jurisdiction to prove or declare title of the demised property which is a matter of decision by a Civil Court. On 07.04.2006 both the respondent No.2 and the petitioner appeared for counseling before the president of the reconciliation committee, who, however, expressed his opinion in their presence, evidenced by a letter issued in the month of April, 2006, that reconciliation for restoration of the family life failed and they were requested to settle their disputes in the family Court. He also asked to settle their dispute over the flat in Court. He, however, requested them to maintain law and order in Mohakhali DOHS area and take care to see that no unpleasant occurrence should take place. Then, the respondent No.1 on 02.07.2006 was constrained to institute Title Suit No.10 of 2006 in the 2nd Court of Joint District Judge at Dhaka for declaration of her title in the flat and also obtained an <em>ad interim </em>order for maintaining <em>status quo</em> pending disposal of the suit.<br/><br/>4. The present petitioner contested the suit by filing affidavit-in-opposition stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that he already gifted the aforesaid flat by virtue of a notarized affidavit dated 24 February, 2005 to his only daughter respondent No.9, Shahreen Shahid. He found the document of oral gift in favour of the respondent No.1 from the Military Executive Officer, which was false. He cancelled the said gift by an affidavit dated 5th January, 2006. He informed respondent No.7 that he already divorced the respondent No.1 and also requested him to mutate the flat in faovur of respondent No.9.<br/><br/>5. Mr. Rafique-ul Huq, learned Counsel, appearing for the petitioner submitted that the writ-respondent No.8 having made a gift of the flat on 24.02.2005 in favour of his only daughter, the alleged oral gift of the same flat on a later date on 11.03.2005  by the writ-respondent No.8 in favour of the writ-petitioner was invalid and did not create any right, title or interest of the writ-petitioner in the said flat and hence, the writ petitioner not having any legal right the writ petition is not maintainable; that the writ petition having involved a disputed questions of fact and of title as to whether there was a gift of the flat in question in faovur of the writ respondent No.9 the writ-respondent No.8 and whether writ-respondent No.9 or writ-petitioner has, the title to the said flat, the questions involved cannot be decided in a summary proceeding under writ jurisdiction; that there having been a gift by writ-respondent No.8 in faovur of his daughter earlier in point of time, which was acted upon, the alleged oral gift in favour of his wife on 21.03.2005 which is later on point of time did not confer any right on the writ-petitioner in respect of the case flat and hence the writ-petitioner has no right to protect her possession in the case flat in the absence of declaration of her title by a competent Court of law and as such, the impugned letter dated 06.06.2006 issued by the writ respondent No.6 directing the writ-petitioner to vacate the case flat was issued with lawful authority; that according to Annexure-2(b) of the affidavit-in-opposition filed by the writ-respondent No.8 he is the owner of the suit property and being a citizen of Bangladesh he has constitutional right to protect his property by contesting in the writ petition; that according to the observation of the High Court Division the owner of the suit property is writ-respondent No.9, daughter of the writ-respondent No.8 who is a minor girl who has been staying abroad for her studies and the writ-respondent No.8 being the natural guardian of writ-respondent No.9 has legal right to protect his daughter's property and as such, the impugned judgment and order dated 07.08.2008 passed by the High Court Division and the cost imposed against the writ-respondent No.8 by the High Court Division are not sustainable in law. The learned Counsel further submitted that the High Court Division wrongly observed that 'which empowers or authorizes respondent No.6 to issue the kind of letter dated 19.03.2006 or the other impugned letter dated 06.06.2006' though the writ-respondent No.6 is lawfully empowered by the Government through a notification vide Memo. No. Shama/Ja-4/29/2001-190 dated 31.04.2003 of the affidavit-in-opposition filed by the writ-respondent No.8 and that the writ-respondent No.6 wrote a letter on 19.03.2006 to the writ-respondent No.8 and informed him that both the oral gift cannot be sustained in law and the writ-petitioner never raised any objection anywhere and did not challenge in the Court of law and according to Section 53 of the Arbitration Act the writ petition is not sustainable in law and the impugned letter dated 06.06.2006 is the continuation process of the Conciliation Committee and as such, the judgment and order dated 078.08.2008 making the Rule absolute and imposing cost on the writ-respondent No.8 is liable to be set aside for the ends of justice.<br/><br/>6. It appears from the record that writ-respondent No.5, Military Estate Officer already expressed by his letter dated 26.02.2006 that he could not prove or decide the title of the parties in the flat and he asked the parties to settle their disputes in Civil Court. Thus, from their own letter it is apparent that the question of title is now to be settled by a Court of competent jurisdiction, hence how the writ-respondent No.6 Cantonment Executive Officer could issue the impugned letter asking the writ-petitioner to vacate the flat is not understood. In such situation, after rejection of the plaint, the writ-petitioner had no efficacious remedy to protect her possession in the flat and accordingly, she had to move the High Court Division and obtained the Rule. The High Court Division held that in the circumstance, writ petition cannot be said to be not maintainable in order to determine the legality of the impugned letter dated 06.06.2006. For the reasons aforesaid, the impugned letter dated 06.06.2006 must be held to have been issued in excess of the powers of the writ-respondent No.6 and therefore, cannot be sustained in law and accordingly, declared to have been issued without any lawful authority and of no legal effect.<br/>In view of the above, we find no substance in the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner.<br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
