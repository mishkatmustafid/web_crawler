The Courts below failed to consider that in a suit for perma­nent injuction, the plaintiff must prove his <em>prima-faice</em> title in the suit land and the plaintiff must be in possession of the suit land but in this case the plaintiff neither could prove his <em>prima-facie</em> title nor pos­session in the suit land.

R. Mudassir Husain CJ. -</strong> This appeal by leave is directed against the judgment and order dated 10-06-1997 by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 376 of 1991 making the Rule absolute by set­ting aside the judgment and decree dated 20-09-1999 passed in Title Appeal No. 244 of 1989 by the learned Subordinate Judge (Artha Rin Adalat), Jessore, who affirmed those dated 20-07-1989 passed by the learned Assistant Judge, Jessore in Title Suit No. 195 of 1986 decreeing the same.<br/><br/>2. The appellant herein as the plaintiff instituted above title suit for permanent injunction against the respondent in the 3rd Court of Munsif, Jessore, in respect of the suit land restraining the respon­dent from disturbing the appellant there­fore or interfering in any way with the peaceful possession of the appellant therein. The case of the appellant was that the land in suit was government khas land. And government granted long term lease of the same to one Alizan on 17-08-1960, who was in possession therein by constructing home­stead. Alizan on obtaining permission in writing from the Government trans­ferred the suit land to the appellant by a registered kabala dated 17-03-1985. Subsequently, the appellant mutated his name in the records of right and had been in peaceful possession by con­structing house in the land in suit and also paid rent to contiguous east of the suit land there was a standing house of the respondent. The respondent with the help of some unruly persons on 13-06-1986 attempted to dispossess the appel­lant from the land in suit. Although the attempt was unsuccessful due to inter­vention of the local people yet the respondent continued to threat to dis­possess the petitioner from the land.<br/><br/>3. Respondent contested the suit by fil­ing a written statement denying the material allegations made by the peti­tioner. His case was that the suit was barred by limitation and was bad for defect of parties. His further case was that the suit property orginally belonged to Kalidas Mukherjee and C.S. khatian No. 82 stood in his name. Kalidas Mukherjee transferred the land to Mirza Fazlul Karim by a patta dated 22-06-1931. Fazlul Karim by a deed of trust dated 30-05-1932 created a trust in respect of .03 l/2 acre of the land of Plot No. 106 and .22 decimals of C.S. Plot No. 105 of Mouja Jessore. On the trust land a Lilla boarding, an Orphanage and a Muslim Library and a Madrasha were also established. And respondent is run­ning the same. As the trust land was ille­gally recorded in the name of the Government, the respondent filed Suit No. 26 of 1985 for correction of the record, which is pending. The respon­dent's futher case was that the petitioner neither had title nor possession in the land in suit.<br/><br/>4. Leave was granted to consider the following ground:<br/>"Because the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division erred in law in reversing the concurrent find­ings of the learned trial Court as well as the appellate Court, based on due consideration of the evi­dence on record and free from any error of law occasioning a failure of justice."<br/><br/>5. Mr. Shaikh Razzaque Ali, the learned counsel appearing the for appellant, having raised the only point as noted above, argued that the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division erred in law in reversing the concurrent find­ing of the learned trial Court as well as the appellate Court based on the consid­eration of evidence on record and free from any error of law occasioning fail­ure of justice.<br/><br/>6. In elaborating his above point, the learned Counsel further argued that the High Court Division in revisional juris­diction  failed  to exercise  its  discre­tionary power in not considering that the findings and decisions arrived at by the lower appellate Court as a final Court are binding upon the High Court Division in the absence of any misread­ing of evidence and misconstruction of any documentary evidence and as such the High Coujt Division committed an error of law in setting aside the judg­ment and decree of Courts below on concurrent findings of fact.<br/><br/>7. Mr. Nawab Ali, the learned Advocate-on-Record, appearing for the respondent No.1 (a), on the other hand, contended that the suit land recorded in C.S. khatian No. 82 originally belonged to Kalidas Mukherjee while he was in possessing having had the right, title interest transferred the same by a regis­tered patta dated 22-06-1931 in favour of Mirza Fazlul Karim, who later on established a Trust namely 'Muslim Trust' by registered trust deed dated 30-05-1932 in respect of 3½ decimals of land of C.S. Plot No. 106 and 22 deci­mals of C.S. Plot No. 105 of Mouza-Jessore wherein the said Fazlul Karim established a Lillah Boarding, an Orphanage and a Muslim Library in the suit land. Subsequently, the Madrasha was also established therein. He further pointed out the suit land has been recorded in S.A. Plot No. 105 under Khatian No.1 in the name of Government of which the defendant-respondents already filed Title Suit No. 26 of 1985 for correction of his alleged wrong record. Mr. Nawab Ali has, how­ever, empathically argued that the afore­said two registered deeds clearly proved that the defendant-respondent is very much in possession of the suit land and for wrong record, he has already filed the above-mentioned Title Suit for cor­rection of said record in the name of the Government. In the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, the plaintiff could neither challenge the aforesaid two registered deeds by properly framed suit in any Court of law, rather posses­sion was very much in favour of said Fazlul Karim. He submits that the High Court Division having considered the registered documents as well as other evidence on record rightly set aside the impugned judgments and decrees of the Courts below.<br/><br/>8. We have perused the impugned judg­ment of the High Court Division as well as the judgments of the Courts below. Having regard to the facts, circum­stances and evidence on record, we are of the view that the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division having applied its judicial mind came to follow­ing findings:<br/>"In this case the defendant-petition­er in support of his contention filed his basic document i.e. the regis­tered patta dated 22-06-1931 marked as Exhibit-'A' and also the trust deed dated 30-5-1932 as Exhibit A/1, showing that the prop­erty was taken by Fazlul Karim from the original owner Kalidash Mukharjee through registered patta and there after the same was perma­nently dedicated by creating trust. Thus, the defendant prayed his title by these two exhibited documents namely Exhibit-A and A/1. These two registered documents being about 60 years of old before filing the suit have got presumption of correctness but the courts below failed to consider this aspect. On the other hand, the plaintiff could not produce any document both oral and documentary challenging the legali­ty of these two documents Exhibit-A and A/1. The Courts below failed to consider that in a suit for perma­nent injuction, the plaintiff must prove his <em>prima-faice</em> title in the suit land and the plaintiff must be in possession of the suit land but in this case the plaintiff neither could prove his <em>prima-facie</em> title nor pos­session in the suit land. Thereafter, the suit ought to have been dis­missed by the Courts below."<br/><br/>9. It is settled law that the plaintiff must prove his case to the effect that he pur­chased the suit land from Alizan who got the land on the basis of lease taken from the Government though the record of right have been made in the name of the Government is the S.A. record. But the correctness of the S.A. record is under challege by the defendant in Title Suit No. 26 of 1985. Therefore, we find that the plaintiff-respondent failed to establish his prima-faice title and pos­session in the suit land and such both the courts below committed an error of law resulting in an error in their decisions causing failure of justice.<br/>10. In consideration of the facts and cir­cumstances, we are of the view that the learned Single Judge committed no ille­gality in passing the impugned judg­ment. We are fully in agreement with the findings and decisions arrived at by the High Court Division. In the result, we find no merit in this appeal. Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed without any order as to cost.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
