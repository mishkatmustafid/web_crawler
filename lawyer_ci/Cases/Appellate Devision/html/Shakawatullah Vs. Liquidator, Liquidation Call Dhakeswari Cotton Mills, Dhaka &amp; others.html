Ruhul Amin J. -</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 09.04.2005 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 2906 of 1999 discharging the Rule.<br/><br/>2. The petitioner filed House Rent Deposit Case No. 8 of 1998 in the 6th Court of Assistant Judge and House Rent Controller, Dhaka for permission to deposit the monthly rent with the Rent Controller under section 19(2) of the Premises Rent Control ordinance, 1983 stating<em>, inter alia</em>, that the suit premises originally belonged to Dhakeshwari Cotton Mills Ltd. and the petitioner being an employee of Dhakeshwari Cotton Mills Ltd. was a monthly tenant at a monthly rental of Tk. 150/- under the Dhakeshwari Cotton Mills Ltd. which was subjected to winding up process under the control and management of the Official Liquidator and ultimately the property vested in the Government and the liquidator has been taking steps to sell the suit property to B.T.M.C and in such circumstances a dis­pute arose with regard to the ownership of the suit property and the petitioner has a doubt as to the <em>bona fide</em> landlord of suit property and intended to deposit the rent with the House Rent Controller till the dispute is resolved. It was further stated that the petitioner sent the rent of Tk. 150/- by a money order to the Liquidator, Government of Bangladesh on 31.12.1987 but the same was returned back to the peti­tioner as undelivered on 03.01.1988. Accordingly the petitioner intended to deposit the monthly rent with the Rent Controller under section 19(2) of the Premises Rent Control Ordinance.<br/><br/>3. The opposite parties contested the case by filing a written objection contending that the petitioner ceased to be a tenant in the suit premises and the property vested in the Government and the present pro­ceeding is barred under Article 23(4) of the Bangladesh Industrial Enterprises (Nationalisation) Order, 1972 and the rent were not deposited with the House Rent Controller in accordance with law. The further case is that the petitioner has defaulted in making deposit of the month­ly rent with the House Rent Controller in accordance with Premises House Rent Ordinance, 1983.<br/><br/>4. We have heard Mrs. Sufia Khatun, the learned Advocate-on-Record for the petitioner and Mr. Md. Nawab Ali, the learned Advocate-on-Record for respondent No.1 and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/><br/>5. The trial court found that the money order containing the monthly rent was returned to the petitioner on 03.01.1988 and the rent deposit case was started on 09.03.1988 and as such the rent deposit case was not legally and validly started. The trial court further found that the peti­tioner deposited the rent for the month of January and February, 1981 at a time and then the rent for June-July, 1988 on 23.08.1988, rent for September and October, 1988 was deposited on 22.11.1988, rent for August and September, 1988 was deposited in the month of November and the rent for November and December 1991 was deposited on 14.01.1992 and the rent for November and December, 1992 was deposited on 30.11.1992. The trial court further found that the petitioner submitted a chalan for the month of August and September, 1993 on 23.10.1993 which was not acceptable. The trial court further found under Article 23(4) of the Bangladesh Industrial Enterprises (Nationalisation) Order, 1972 (P.O. No. 27 of 1972) when a winding up order has been made, no suit or other legal proceed­ing shall be proceeded with or com­menced against a scheduled industrial enterprise or any industrial enterprise placed under a Corporation by an order under clause (1) of Article 10 and all suits and order legal proceedings pending against such an enterprise on the date of winding up order shall abate. The trial court noticed that the winding up proceed­ing of the opposite party No.1 was started on 23.01.1982 and published in Bangladesh Gazette on 04.02.1982 and thereby rent deposit proceeding could not commence and shall not proceed with. The trial court further noticed that both the parties admitted that the suit property had already been transferred to Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation (B.T. M.C.) and the petitioner by operation of law ceased to be a tenant in the suit property. Accordingly the trial court disallowed the case. The petitioner being aggrieved pre­ferred Miscellaneous Appeal No. 290 of 1997 and the appellate court by judgment and order dated 29.06.1999 dismissed the appeal and affirmed the judgment by the trial court, Being aggrieved the petitioner moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and the Rule obtained was discharged.<br/><br/>6. The High Court Division on considera­tion of the materials on record found that the rent was not deposited in accordance with law and the petitioner became a defaulter. The High Court Division further held that no suit or proceeding can start in respect of the opposite party No.1 who went under winding up process. The High Court Division further held that the peti­tioner had already retired from the employment of Dhakeshwari Cotton Mills Ltd. and therefore ceased to be employee of the Mill and thereby ceased to be a ten­ant as tenant and landlord relationship also ceased to exist.<br/><br/>7. In our view, the High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision. There is no cogent reason to interfere with the judgment of the High Court Division.<br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
