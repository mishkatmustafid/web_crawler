The respondent Nos.1 to 5 as plaintiffs instituted Title Suit No. 86 of 1992 for declaration of title and khas possession which was renumbered as Title Suit No. 21 of 1994.<br/><br/>3. The plaintiff's case, in short, is that Sheikh Jabbar Ali, Abed Ali and 4 others were recorded tenants in C.S. Khatian No.96 containing 19 plots including Plot No.800 measuring .70 acres, that Sheikh Jabbar Ali's share was ½ and Abed Ali's share was 1/12 in the said khatian and that .52 acres of land as P.S. and S.A Plot No. 979 had been in exclusive possession of Sheikh Jabbar Ali and P.S. Khatian No.138 was recorded accordingly and   that Sheikh Jabbar Ali died leaving two sons, namely, Abdus Sattar, Fazu Mia and two daughters, namely, Amironnessa and Samirunnessa one son and one daughter of the previous owner, namely, Abdus Sattar and Amirunnessa sold .22 acres of land out of .52 acres of land to Chini Mia on 26.08.1961 and   the name of the purchaser was accordingly recorded in S.A. Khatian and R.S. Khatian. Chini Mia transferred .473 acres (mentioned in 'Ka' schedule) to the plaintiffs by a registered kabala dated 26.06.1979 who possessed the property through cultivation of vegetable in some portion and also erected a tin shed room in part of the suit land and that in 1991 the defendant No. 2 dispossessed the plaintiffs by force from the Kha schedule land measuring .0330 acres and also dismantled the dwelling structure of the plaintiffs and hence the plaintiff felt constrained to institute the suit.<br/><br/>4. The defendant Nos. 1 and 2 contested the suit contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit Plot No. 979 belonged to Abed Ali who died leaving his wife Fulmati and three sons, namely, Abdul Hai, Afzal and Taher Ali and two daughters Suratunessa and Arafatunessa and that Abed Ali transferred 10 kathas of land to Ashraf Bepari and Hossain Bepari in the year 1987 and 3 kathas of land to Nasima Begurn and Manik Fakir and again 4 kathas of land to the predecessor of the defendant No.1 and thereafter transferred 3 kathas of land to Abdul Aziz Master and that the defendant No.1 by kabala dated  30.04.1991 purchased 2½ kathas of land from Ashraf Uddin and that the defendant No.1 has been residing in the suit land and the plaintiffs having no right, title and possession the suit was liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>5. The trial court after recording evidence of six witnesses of the plaintiff and four witnesses from the defendant and considering the same decreed the suit.<br/><br/>6. The defendant petitioners preferred Title Appeal No.253 of 1993. The lower appellate court reversed the judgment and decree of the trial court and dismissed the suit whereupon the plaintiff respondents moved the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.5399 of 1998 and a learned Single Judge of the High Court Division made the rule absolute and thereby decreed the suit.<br/><br/>7. Being aggrieved the defendant petitioner moved this Court in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 1196 of 2003. This Court after hearing the petitioner dismissed the petition. Hence is this petition.<br/><br/>8. In support of the petition Mr. Abdus Salam Khan, learned Counsel submits that the defendant's title deed was marked as exhibit "kha"; S.A. khatian and rent receipt as "C" series so as to prove collateral evidence of title and possession in the suit land but the High Court Division by non-reading of evidence was wrong to hold that the defendant has no document of possession and the Appellate Division in turn maintained the finding that plaintiffs acquired title and possession by earlier purchase and thus there is an  error apparent on the face of the record.<br/><br/>9. On perusal of the judgment of this Court it appears that this Court considered the facts and circumstances of the case and the submissions made by the learned Counsel and finding no ground for interference the Civil Petition has been dismissed. The point now urged by the learned Counsel has therefore no leg to stand. A review does not mean rehearing of the same matter already heard and disposed of on merit.<br/><br/>In view of the discussion made above, the review petition is dismissed.   <br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
