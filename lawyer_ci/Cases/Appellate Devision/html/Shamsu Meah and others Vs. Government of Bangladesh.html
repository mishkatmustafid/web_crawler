Tafazzul Islam J. -</strong> These petition for leave to appeal are directed against the judgment and order dated 04.09.2004 of the High Court Division passed in Writ Petition No.5756, 5757, 5758, 5759, 5795, 5796, 5797, 5799, 5800, 5801, 5802, 5803 of 2000 discharging the Rules obtained challenging the Memo dated 16.11.2000 under the signature of the Assistant Commissioner of Land, the respondent No.9, canceling the allotment of rehabilitation Plot No.24/2, Block E, Mohammadpur Housing Estate.<br/><br/>2. The petitioners of Civil Petition No.431 of 2005 filed Writ Petition No. 5756 of 2000 on the averments that their home­steads being acquired by the Government, the Land Allotment Committee, Ministry of Works, in terms of the decision taken in the year 1993, subsequently, in the year 1999 allotted 12 rehabilitation plots to them as affected persons for a period of 99 years on payment of considerations and on 10.10.2000 the possession of the respec­tive plots were handed over to the respec­tive constituted attornies of the petitioners and they were possessing the said plots by constructing houses and living therein with their family members; the Ministry of Works, in pursuance of its scheme to construct 500 flats for government offi­cials in different Housing Estates under the project initiated by the National Housing Authority, initially decided not to include the above rehabilitation plots allotted to the petitioners in Mohammadpur Housing Estates but sub­sequently, all on a sudden, by the impugned Memo dated 16.11.2000 can­celled the allotment of the plots in their favour and also cancelled the approval of the Ministry as regard the Powers of Attorney in respect of the said lands; con­struction of 500 flats as proposed will not in any way fall within the site plan of aforesaid 12 plots and as such the order of cancellation of the said plots is arbitrary and malafide; the petitioners, having taken possession of their plots from the Government invested huge amount of money for raising boundary wall and con­struction of semi pucca structures in their respective plots and in such situation the Government is bound by the principles of promissory estoppel and the Ministry of Works cannot be allowed to retrieve their steps and cancel the allotments.<br/><br/>3. The respondent No.1 opposed the Rules and filed affidavit-in-opposition as well as supplementary affidavits categori­cally denying that possession of the plots in question had been handed over to the petitioners and/or that any construction has been made on the said plots by the petitioners and/or the petitioners are living therein and contended that a section of influential plot grabbers influencing the lower grade officials of the Ministry of Works fraudulently created a so call plan and also the letters showing allotments and delivery of possession which were anti dated and manufactured for the pur­pose of these writ petitions; the area con­cerned is reserved for construction of 500 flats for the Government officials and the said decisions was made in the year 1996 and ECNEC on 26.04.1998 approved the plan and proposal and as such the question of delivery of possession of the concerned lands to the petitioners did not arise at all; the instant Rules and the order of tempo­rary injunction from this Court has been obtained by making false statements; there has been no delivery of possession and no deeds have been executed in favour of the petitioners in respect of the concerned plots and so the question of construction of the houses and living therein does not arise.<br/><br/>4. By a supplementary affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent No.1 it has been stated that no physical possession of any land the alleged as per sketch map was handed over to the constituted attornies of the petitioners and the petitioners are not in possession of the concerned lands on constructing houses therein; the docu­ments submitted by the petitioners in sup­port of their claims are fraudulent and col­lusive and procured through unfair and illegal means and the signatures of the concerned officials therein and also the sketch map are forged and that the Anti-Corruption Bureau has been investigating into the matter under B.A.C. Case No.114-2000/T.F.3; the allotment letter annexed in the writ petition as Annexure-X contains the date 23.03.1999 but the copies of the same which were sent to the Superintending Engineer and to the Executive Engineer contains the date 09.10.2000 and the time of difference of 19 months between the letters creates seri­ous doubt as to the genuineness of the allotment letters and further the plots men­tioned in the allotment letter, Annexure-X, does not appear in any other map pre­served in any other office of the Government and further Annexure X also contains no Memo number and also con­spicuously divulges the absence of the sig­nature of the Executive Engineer and sim­ilarly Annexure-E is also a fraudulent and collusive document where the signature of the Executive Engineer is not shown; the concerned lands are still vacant and empty without any structures standing thereon; attempt has been made by the petitioners to construct boundary walls which became the subject matter of a G.D. Entry with the Mohammadpur police Station; the respon­dent No.1 filed another supplementary affidavit stating that the affidavit sworn by Sakander Hay at, the then Executive Engineer, Public Works Department, and Md. Golam Murtoza Assistant Engineer, Public Works Department another Alauddin Ahmed, a retired government officer before Notary Public, clearly shows that Annexure-X(4) purportedly bearing their signatures is a fraudulent document in that their respective signatures therein haven been forged and fur­ther the sketch map, Annexure-X(4), never originated from the Ministry of Works the Executive Engineer Sub-division-II, Mohammadpur Housing Estate, the respondent No.6, also filed affidavit-in-opposition stating that the powers of attorney are benami transactions and between the two, the attornies are the real beneficiary and the owner of the plots.<br/><br/>5. The High Court Division, after hearing, discharged the Rules holding that the cases of the petitioners are based on letters of allotment and subsequent documents allegedly issued by the office of the respondent No.1 and 6 and the petitioners on the basis of those tried to show that they were allotted different plots as affect­ed persons and subsequent to such allot­ments they were given possession of the concerned plots and they also made pay­ment to the Government but notwithstand­ing that the Government most illegally and with malafide intention cancelled the said allotments; the Government as well as the Executive Engineer, Mohammadpur Housing Estate on the other hand categor­ically asserted that the documents relied upon by the petitioners starting from the letters of allotment, passing of challans, delivery of possession sketch map show­ing creation of plots etc. are all spurious; the statement made in the affidavit sworn before the Notary Public by the concerned Senior Government officials namely Eskander Hayat the then Executive Engineer, Public Works Department, Md. Golam Murtoza, Assistant Engineer, Public Works Department and another Alauddin Ahmed a retired government officer show that their respective signa­tures allegedly appearing in a sketch map of showing the allotment of concerned plots, have been forged; furthermore, in the writ petition it has been stated that the petitioners were given possession of the concerned plots and they are living there­in constructing house therein whereas in their affidavits-in-opposition the Government contended that the concerned plots are still vacant and possession of the same was never handed over to any body and thus disputed questions of facts hav­ing been raised, the Court sitting in writ jurisdiction, will not take evidence and adjudicate on such matter; further the sub­mission made by the petitioners to the effect that supplementary affidavits hav­ing been filed by the respondents during the hearing stage should not be considered by the Court has no substance since the records show that no objection was made on behalf of the petitioners when the doc­ument as annexed with made on behalf of the petitioners when the document, as annexed with the above affidavits, were submitted and as such it will be presumed that those documents were submitted with their approval or at least with the leave of the court; moreover for obtaining relief the petitioners are required to show that they have come before this Court with Clean hands, all the writ petitions were filed by the Attornies of the petitioners as is evident from the cause title of the writ petitions and possession of the lands are also alleged to have been received by their Attornies and as it appears, the Power of Attorney executed by the allottees in favour of the Attornies indicated transfer of the concerned lands in favour of the Attornies in violation of Clause 7 of the allotment letters and accordingly the peti­tioners, who have been allegedly evicted from their homesteads, have nothing to be aggrieved even if the plots are not allotted to them because in any event their interest in the said plots has already been given to their respective Attornies and that is why the alleged allottees themselves have not signed the vokalatnama and filed the writ petitions not they received the possession of the respective plots and thus the peti­tioners having nor come with clean hand, the writ petitions are not maintainable.<br/><br/>6.  Accordingly there is no illegality or infirmity in the decision of the High Court Division so as to call for any interference.<br/><br/>7. The petitions are dismissed but however the observation of the High Court Division on the merit, of the case will have no bearing while deciding the dispute by any civil Court.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
