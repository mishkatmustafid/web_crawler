The suit was filed seeking declaration that the orders described in schedule 'Ka' and 'Kha' and the proceedings initiated on the basis of the said orders are illegal, void, without jurisdiction and as such not bind­ing upon the plaintiffs.<br/><br/>2. It appears that the plaintiffs are claim­ing the land measuring 115.71 acres of Touzi Nos. 1763 and 1764 of the Bakerganj Collectorate and upon making claim on the land of the said Touzis in respect of which suit has been filed. It is the case of the plaintiffs that the land of the said Touzis dilluviated and that after alluvion they as the tenants of the land of the said Touzis approached the authority for allotment of the land so alluviated and the authority allowed the prayer so made and that as against the said order the Government moved the Board of Revenue by way of appeal and the same was dis­missed, that Title Suit No.90 of 1994 was also dismissed and thus the permanent set­tlement holder Raja Rajesh Kanta Roy got the land and said Raja Rajesh Kanta Roy executed a Power of Attorney appointing Kamaluddin Chowdhury as the Attorney and the said Attorney settled the land of the aforementioned Touzis to plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs obtained settlement from said Kamaluddin Chowdhury and that while the plaintiffs were in possession of their land there was a dispute as to whether the land claimed by them is with­in the District of Noakhali and in that con­nection Title Suit No.159 of 190 was filed in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Barisal and therein plaintiffs' title was declared, that the plaintiffs approached the authority to accept rent from them but the defendants claimed half of the paddy pro­duced and also refused to accept rent and .that ultimately the Authority started cer­tificate cases and thereupon the plaintiffs are constrained to file the suit challenging legality of the certificate cases as well as the order described in schedule 'Ka'<br/><br/>3. The suit was contested by the defendant Nos. 1-4 as well as by the defendant No.5 by filing separate sets of written statement denying the material averments made in the plaint and contending, inter alia, that the suit is not maintainable and the same is barred by limitation and that the land in suit is the khas land of the Government1 and that the plaintiffs on the basis of their pattan said to have been obtained from Kamal Uddin Chowdhury did not pay rent and as such certificate case has been started. It was the case of the defendant No. 5 that the land shown in 'Ga' schedule went under water and as such the plaintiffs have no right, title and possession.<br/><br/>4. The trial Court dismissed the suit on the finding that the suit filed challenging the legality of the certificate case is not main­tainable. The plaintiffs went on appeal but without any success. Thereupon the plain­tiffs moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained Rule.<br/><br/>5. The High Court Division discharged the Rule on the finding that plaintiffs failed to establish their claim as regard the land in suit and that also failed to prove their pos­session in the land in suit. The High Court Division while discharging the Rule has observed that plaintiffs did not seek the relief as to their title in the land in suit and that the plaintiffs did not establish their claim as regard the land in suit by adduc­ing evidence.<br/><br/>6. It is seen that plaintiffs have filed the suit seeking declaration the proceedings initiated for realization of rent are illegal and void and not binding upon them. The plaintiffs could not establish their title in the land in suit and that they being in pos­session of the land which belongs to the Government and they having not paid rent required to be filed by the kind of person as the plaintiffs are the relevant authority has initiated the proceedings in question. In the said state of the matter we are of the view the High Court Division as well as courts below were not in error in holding that the suit filed by the plaintiffs is not maintainable.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate-on-record could not point out error of the kind in the judg­ment of the High Court Division calling for interference.<br/>Accordingly the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
