It further appears that the defendant though raised a plea of maintainability of partition suit for non-impleading of concerned co-sharers and for not bringing the entire properties of deceased owner Haji Bilat Ali Mondal in the hotchpotch of the suit but utterly failed to bring to record as to who are co-sharers who have been left out of the suit and which properties have not been brought to the hotchpotch of the suit. The lower appellate court being the final court of facts considered the evidence and held "On an analyses of the evidence on record, it appears to me that the above observation of the Court of appeal below is not only being based upon gross misreading of evi­dence on record also being based on mis­interpretation of material evidences on record. I, therefore, find that there is a good deal of substance in the contentions raised by Mr. Abul Quasem and the view taken by the appellate Court below cannot be legally sustained." It therefore appears that the High Court Division noticed that the lower appellate court reversed the decision of the trial court on consideration of the evidence upon assigning cogent rea­son. The learned Judge of the High Court Division came to the finding "On consid­eration of the materials adduced by the parties, I find sufficient reasons to hold that Fakimon Nesssa, the mother of the plaintiff-petitioners having been put into possession over 1.32 acres of land by Haji Bilat Ali on the strength of kabala dated 11.02.61.                                                                                          … (8)</strong></div> <br/><strong>Lawyers Involved:</strong><br/><em>Dr. M.

The respondents as plaintiffs instituted other class Suit No.38 of 1987 in the Court of Assistant Judge, Gomestapur, Nawabgonj for declaration that the <em>Heba-Bil-Ewaz</em> deed dated 13.1.1974 allegedly given by the predecessor of the plaintiffs in favour of the defendant Nos.1-6 is forged, collusive, illegal and created by false personification and as such the same is ineffective and not binding upon the plaintiffs and also for partition of the prop­erty as given in ka, kha, and Ga schedule of the plaint stating, <em>inter-alia</em>, that the suit land, as given in schedule ka, kha, and Ga of the plaint, originally belonged to Bilat Ali Mondal, the predecessor of the plain­tiffs and the defendants; that Bilat Ali Mondal married seven times, who died leaving behind his last wife Fakimon Bibi, the mother of the plaintiffs; that before his death he transferred some properties measuring 1.23 acres of land on 12.01.1961 in favour of the mother of the plaintiffs in lieu of her dower, besides this he did not transfer any land to any body; that the defendants claimed land by two <em>Heba-Bil-Ewaz</em> deeds were created after the death of their father Bilat Ali Mondal by false personification. Hence the suit.<br/><br/>3. The present petitioner as defendants contested the suit by filing written state­ment denying the case of the plaintiffs stating, <em>inter alia,</em>that the suit of the plain­tiffs is not maintainable inasmuch as there was no cause of action to institute the suit; that the suit is barred by limitation and bad for defect of parties; that the defendants case is  that the  suit  land originally belonged to Bilat Ali Mondal, who trans­ferred the suit land to defendant Nos.1-6 by executing two <em>Heba-Bil-Ewaz</em> deeds; that the alleged deed dated 12.1.1961 in favour of the mother of the plaintiffs is false, forged and fabricated and as such the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>4. The trial Court upon taking evidence and on hearing the parties decreed the suit by judgment and decree dated 26.10.1998 in preliminary form.  Being aggrieved thereby the defendant Nos. 1-6 as appellants filed Title Appeal No.188 of 1998 before the learned District Judge, Nawabganj. The learned Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), 1st Court, Nawabganj by judgment and decree dated 27.01.2000 reversed the decision of the trial Court, allowed the appeal and dismissed the plaintiffs suit.<br/><br/>5. Against the aforesaid judgment and decree the plaintiffs as petitioners moved the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.1776 of 2000 and a learned Single Judge upon hearing the parties made the rule absolute, set aside the judgment and decree of the appellate Court and restored those of the trial Court.<br/><br/>6. Being aggrieved thereby the defendants as petitioners filed the instant petition seeking leave to appeal.<br/><br/>7. Dr. M. Zahir, the learned Senior Advocate appears on behalf of the peti­tioners while Mr. Abul Kashem, Advocate-on-record appears on behalf of the respon­dent Nos.1-3.<br/><br/>8. We have heard the lengthy submissions of the learned Senior Counsel Dr. M. Zahir for the petitioners and also Mr. Abul Kashem, Advocate on record for the respondent. Dr. M. Zahir submits that the High Court Division committed serious error of law in failing to consider the facts that Haji Bilat Ali Mondal during his life time partitioned his properties amongst his legal heirs amicably and as a result of amicable partition plaintiffs got 5.23 acres of land of R. S. Khatians 400 and 108 and 0.3188 acres was given to his wife Faki Bibi and defendants got their share by reg­istered deeds No.75/46 and 75/47  and received their respective possession which shows that the partition was complete. Dr. M. Zahir then submits that a partition suit is not maintainable because the <em>ejmali</em> properties of co-sharers was not brought to hotchpotch and the High Court Division accordingly committed gross error in decreeing the suit. Mr. Abul Kashem, the learned Advocate-on-record supported the decision of the High Court Division. It appears that there is no evidence to con­clude that there was any partition by metes and bounds between the parties. It further appears that the defendant though raised a plea of maintainability of partition suit for non-impleading of concerned co-sharers and for not bringing the entire properties of deceased owner Haji Bilat Ali Mondal in the hotchpotch of the suit but utterly failed to bring to record as to who are co-sharers who have been left out of the suit and which properties have not been brought to the hotchpotch of the suit. The lower appellate court being the final court of facts considered the evidence and held "On an analyses of the evidence on record, it appears to me that the above observation of the Court of appeal below is not only being based upon gross misreading of evi­dence on record also being based on mis­interpretation of material evidences on record. I, therefore, find that there is a good deal of substance in the contentions raised by Mr. Abul Quasem and the view taken by the appellate Court below cannot be legally sustained." It therefore appears that the High Court Division noticed that the lower appellate court reversed the decision of the trial court on consideration of the evidence upon assigning cogent rea­son. The learned Judge of the High Court Division came to the finding "On consid­eration of the materials adduced by the parties, I find sufficient reasons to hold that Fakimon Nesssa, the mother of the plaintiff-petitioners having been put into possession over 1.32 acres of land by Haji Bilat Ali on the strength of kabala dated 11.02.61.<br/><br/>9. Having given my best consideration the materials on record both oral and docu­mentary, I hold that the impugned judg­ment and decree of the appellate Court below suffers from illegalities in many folds, it cannot be sustained in law and is liable to be set aside and the findings arrived at by the trial Court below have been rested upon consideration and dis­cussion of legal evidences and materials of the legal aspect involved in the suit."<br/><br/>10. Thus, it appears that the impugned judgment of the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division considered all the aspects of the case and found no illegality or irregularity committed by the appellate Court being the final Court of fact in grant­ing a decree in favour of the plaintiff. We do not therefore find any substance in any of the submissions of the   learned Advocate for the petitioners.<br/>Accordingly this leave petition is dis­missed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
