Ruhul Amin J. -</strong> This petition for leave to appeal has been filed against the judgment dated July 22, 2003 of a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 1595 of 1996 discharging the Rule obtained against the judgment and decree dated March 3, 1996 of the Court of Subordinate Judge (now Court of Joint District Judge) and Artha Rin Adalat, Faridpur in Title Appeal No. 172 of 1991 allowing the same and thereby setting aside the judgment and decree dated May 21, 1991 of the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Madhukhali, Faridpur in Title Suit No. 5 of 1989 dismissing the same.<br/><br/>2. The suit was filed seeking declaration of title and khas possession and for the further relief that the auction sale in cer­tificate case No. 615 BK of 1981-82 is fraudulent and void. The appellate Court upon allowing the appeal decreed the suit and thereupon directed the defendant Nos. 1-3 to vacate the land in suit within 30 days failing which plaintiff would be enti­tled to take delivery of possession through Court.<br/><br/>3. The suit was filed stating<em>, inter alia</em>, that the land in suit belonged to Dharani Dhor and he had 2 sons, Khokan Chandra Malo and Dasharath Chandra Malo by his first wife, that Dharani Dhor's first wife and Khokan Chandra Malo died before Dharani Dhor and Dasharath, that Dharani Dhor has a daughter by name Shoshti Rani through his second wife, Kudi Shandari, that Dharani Dhor gifted 3.63 acres of land to Dasharath Chandra Malo and plaintiffs mother Kudi Shundari, that land measuring 1.82½ acres is the 'Stree Dhan' of Kudi Shundari. Dasharath sold his property to different persons, that Kudi Shundari sold 36 decimals of land to Kalipada Shaha who sold the same to Manu Chowdhury. Kudi Shundari died leaving the plaintiff, that plaintiffs hus­band and minor son died leaving her, that plaintiff is staying in the land in suit and that on 5th Aswin, 1392 BS defendants threatened her to dispossess and thereupon he making query came to know that defen­dant No. 1 has auction purchased the land although no notice of the proceeding in which auction sale held was served on the plaintiff, that the auction was held beyond the knowledge of the plaintiff, that land in suit is not the land of her father and that the land in suit is the 'Stree Dhan' of her mother, that defendant No. 6 forcibly entered on the land on 6th Bhadra, 1397 BS and has erected a hut on 13 decimals of land and that defendant Nos. 1-3 had dis­possessed the plaintiff, that plaintiff filed a case before the certificate officer for set­ting aside the auction sale but the same was dismissed.<br/><br/>4. The suit was contested by the defendant Nos. 1-3 denying the material averments made in the plaint and stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the land of the khatian No.4 belonged to Dharani Dhar Malo and that plaintiff is the daughter of Dharani Dhar's second wife, that while plaintiff was in possession of Dharani Dhar's property she sold some property to Abul Hossain, Rustom Ali and Manu Chowdhury, that the rest of the land has been recorded in the name of Dharani Dhar Malo, that rent having not been paid certificate case was started and in the cer­tificate case land in suit was put to auction and the defendants have purchased the land in suit, that notice of the certificate case as well as the notice of the auction proceeding was duly served and the auc­tion was held within the knowledge of the plaintiff, that the defendants got posses­sion within the knowledge of the plaintiff, that defendants have erected hut in some portion of the land and that rest of the land was possessed by them upon cultivating the same, that defendants upon mutation of their names paying rent, that plaintiff filed Miscellaneous case before the certifi­cate officer for setting aside of the auction sale but the same was dismissed.<br/><br/>5. The trial Court dismissed the suit on the finding that plaintiff failed to prove his case. The plaintiff went on appeal. The appellate Court allowed the appeal on the finding that the certificate case was fraud­ulent and collusive one.<br/><br/>6. The defendants moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained Rule. The High Court Division discharged the Rule on the finding that certificate case was filed in the name of dead person and as such the certificate case so filed was illegal and that there was "material irregularity in the certificate pro­ceedings.”<br/><br/>7. It is seen from the materials on record that the lower appellate Court on consideration of the evidence arrived at the finding that certificate case in respect of the land in suit was initiated in the name of dead person and as such the certificate case so started was illegal and consequent there­upon auction sale held without service of the notice as per sections 7 and 43 and Rule 46 of the Public Demands Recovery Act on the claimant of the land the certifi­cate sale was illegal.<br/><br/>8. The learned Advocate-on-record could not point out that the High Court Division and the lower appellate Court were in error in holding that the certificate case in which plaintiffs land was sold was started in the name of dead person. In that view of the matter we are of the view that High Court Division has committed no error in affirming the judgment of the appellate Court decreeing the suit on the finding and decision as stated hereinbefore and as such no interference is called for with the judgment sought to be appealed by this Division.<br/>Accordingly the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
