Ruhul Amin CJ.-</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order 13th March, 2007 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 3460 of 2001 discharging the Rule.<br/><br/>2.  Short facts as placed  before the High Court Division are that the plaintiff instituted Title Suit No.72 of 1991 in the Court of learned Senior Assistant Judge, Sirajganj praying for declaration of title and for partition and also for permanent injunction restraining the defendant Nos.1 and 2 from transferring the suit land contending, <em>inter alia,</em> that the suit land belonged to Munju Sundari, Shashanka Mohan Saha Chowdhury and others and Krishna Mohan Saha Schedule 'Ka' land was purchased by Serajul Huq and Azizul Huq alias Tafazal Haque and Sardar Ali.  They constructed some structures covering 4 plots of land under parti­tion. Thereafter, there took place amicable par­tition among them. As per that amicable parti­tion 1/3rd share of structures (shop) was obtained by Serajul Huq, 1/3 rd portion from the middle was allotted to the saham of the defendant No. 5 Sadar Ali and Azizul Huq got the rest from the southern part. Thereafter, Serajul Huq sold his share by a Kabala deed dated 27-2-1967 in favour of the defendant Nos. 1-4. The defendant No. 1 is the husband and the defendant No. 2 is the wife of the defendant No.1, the defendant Nos. 3 and 4 are the full brothers of the defendant No.1. The defendant Nos. 3 and 4 sold their share measuring an area of 0.0150 acres of land including 1/6th portions of the shop by a kabala deed dated 17-9-1990 in favour of the plaintiff who demanded partition and that was refused. Hence, was the suit.<br/><br/>3. The defendant No.1 contested the suit by filing written statement denying the materials made in the plaint contending, <em>inter alia,</em> that the defendant Nos. 3 and 4 were his benamder and he was the real owner. It was his further case that as benami was not proved, he was entitled to get back the transferred land under section 4 of the Partition Act.<br/><br/>4. The trial Court by the impugned judgment and decree dated 20-3-1994 decreed the suit on condition that the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 would get the privilege of getting pre­empted the plaintiff's share under section 4 of the Partition Act if Taka 90,000 was deposited within 90 (ninety) days of the date of decree failing which the decree for partition was to be maintained.<br/><br/>5. On appeal being Title Appeal No.53 of 1994, the appellate Court upon consideration of the evidence on record refused the claim of the benami as raised by the defendant Nos.1 and 2 and held that the aid of section 4 of the Partition Act was not available in favour of the defend­ant Nos.1 and 2 and decreed the suit reversing the judgment of the trial Court.<br/><br/>6. Being aggrieved, the defendants moved the High Court Division and obtained Rule which after hearing was discharged as noticed earlier.<br/><br/>7. We have heard AKM Shahidul Huq, the learned Advocate-on-Record for the peti­tioners and Mr. Md. Azizul Huq, the learned Counsel for the respondent No.1 and perused the impugned judgment of the High Court Divi­sion and other connected papers on record.<br/><br/>8. The High Court Division found that the suit land under partition was not a dwelling house and, as such, section 4 of the Partition Act was not applicable in the case as claimed by the defendant Nos.1 and 2 of the suit. The High Court Division also found that the trial Court rightly decided the matter in controversy and hence did not commit any error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice in passing the judgment and decree.<br/><br/>9. Considering the facts and circumstan­ces of the case we are of the view that the High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision.<br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
