Afzal J.—</strong>This appeal following leave is from judgment and order dated 4th June 1982 passed by a Single Judge of the High Court Divi­sion, Dhaka in Civil Revision No. 869 of 1979 set­ting aside the concurrent decision of the courts below and dismissing the suit being Title Suit No. 272 of 1975 of the Second Court of Munsif, Chandpur. 12. The original plaintiff No. 1 Kabil Miah Mesteri (since deceased), who was the father of Re­spondent No. 1 and 3 (defendants 1 and 2), and the Respondent No. 4 (Plaintiff No. 2) instituted the aforesaid suit for declaration that the <em>Hiba-Bil-Ewaz</em> deed dated 22.1.75 (Ext.1 A1) in favour of his (Plain­tiff No. 1’s) daughters (defendants 1 and 2) was frau­dulent, void, illegal and not binding upon the plain­tiffs.<br/><br/>3. Plaintiffs' case was that plaintiff No. 1 be­ing in need of money decided to mortgage. 20 decimals of land to defendant Nos. 3 and 4 (his son-in-laws) for a consideration of Tk. 500/-. Accordingly plaintiff No. 1 went to Faridgonj S.R. Office on 22.1.75 where the said defendants in collusion with the deed-writer got a deed of <em>Hiba-bil-Ewaz</em> executed in favour of defendants 1 and 2. Plaintiff No. 1 was not aware of the contents of the said deed and he came to know about it on the following day when he demanded the money.<br/><br/>4. Defendants 1 and 3 (Respondents 1 and 2) contested the suit by filing a joint written state­ment. It was asserted, inter alia, that plaintiff No. 1 being satisfied with the services of his daughters (de­fendants 1 and 2) made a gift of the suit land to them by executing the <em>Hiba-bil-Ewaz</em> deed on 22.1.75, that the daughters presented a piece of Holy Koran to their father in exchange of the suit land and that they have been in possession of the land since the gift was made to them.<br/><br/>5. The learned Munsif decreed the suit upon finding that plaintiff No. 1 had no bonafide intention to execute the alleged deed and the genuineness of the same was doubtful as the other daughter (defendant No. 2) did not come to contest the suit.<br/><br/>6. The learned Subordinate Judge, Second Court, Comilla, on appeal, agreed with the findings of the learned Munsif and affirmed the judgment and decree by his order dated 19.4.79.<br/><br/>7. Respondents 1 and 2 preferred a revision against the appellate judgment and decree in which the impugned judgment and order have been passed.<br/><br/>8. In dismissing the suit the learned Judge of the High Court Division admitted into evidence a certified copy of the kabala dated 23.7.75 marking the same Ext. B' and found on the basis thereof that Sona Miah (appellate No. 1 and brother of Kabil Miah, plaintiff no. 1) having purchased some portion of the suit land from alleged donee of the Hiba-bil-Ewaz was now estopped from challenging the said deed. The other findings made by the learned judge need not be, referred to in view of the limited ques­tion on which leave was granted and the appeal heard and particularly in view of the order which is pro­posed to be passed in this appeal.<br/><br/>9. The appellants in their application (8.11.79) for being added as parties in the High Court Division stated that plaintiff No. 1 after ob­taining decree in the trial court transferred out of the suit property .60 decimals of land by two registered sale deeds in their favour in consideration of Tk. 6000/-, Tk. 3000/- for each kabala, and that the ap­pellants have been in possession of the said land to the knowledge of the defendants. It appears from the impugned judgment that the learned Judge rejected this application on the ground that they were not ne­cessary or proper parties by virtue of their purchase. At the same time it was noticed that Sona Miah (ap­pellant No.1) was already on record on his own peti­tion as one of the heirs and successors of plaintiff No. 1 and thus he was fully represented in the revi­sion case. Be it mentioned that plaintiff No.1 who was opposite party No.1 in the said revision case died during the pendency of the said case and was substituted by his heirs, the daughters (who were al­ready on record) and appellant No.1.<br/><br/>10. In the petition for leave to appeal the ap­pellants stated that the defendants without the knowledge and consent of appellant No.l Sona Miah created a deed of sale for 02-1/2 decimals of land in his favour though as a matter of fact he did not pur­chase the said land from the defendants at any time. This has been reiterated by the appellants in their concise statement. In the concise statement filed by respondent Nos. 1 and 2, there is no denial of the said assertion made by the appellants.<br/><br/>11. Leave was granted to consider whether the learned Judge of the High Court Division acted cor­rectly in admitting additional evidence (certified copy of the kabala dated 23.7.75 produced by the defen­dants) in the revision case and further whether he ought to have remanded the case for rehearing after admitting the kabala.<br/><br/>12. At the hearing of the appeal the learned Advocate for the appellants pressed the second part of the aforesaid submission. He submitted that the al­leged kabala which the appellants deny was relied upon by the High Court Division without consider­ing the, genuineness of the said document and this has led to a miscarriage of justice. He also submitted that it was absolutely necessary to make an order of remand if the disputed kabala was to be considered as evidence in the case giving the parties an opportu­nity for proving and disproving the kabala in accordance with law.<br/><br/>13. It is true that the defendants stated in their written statement that defendants 1 and 2 had sold 0.2-1/2 decimals of land out of the disputed land to appellant No. 1, Sona Miah in Sraban, 1382 B.S. and delivered possession of the same. Sona Miah was a witness (P.W.2) for the plaintiffs but the aforesaid transaction between him and the defendants was not an issue in the suit. It does not appear from the judg­ments either of the trial court or of the appellate court that the defendants wanted to prove the kabala of the aforesaid transaction. The learned Judge of the High Court Division has observed that the document was not challenged by the plaintiffs. We do not find any reference in the judgments of the courts below that the said document was either brought on record or admitted by the plaintiffs or was at all a matter of controversy between the contesting parties. The al­leged kabala has assumed importance because of Sona Miah's stepping into the shoes of plaintiff No. 1, firstly, as a purchaser of the disputed land and secondly, as an heir and successor of Kabil Miah. Although the kabala was allowed to be admitted in evidence, it does not appear from the High Court Judgment as to what position Sona Miah took or, what argument was advanced on his behalf with re­gard to the said document. Since he has disputed the said transaction, we think the elementary principles of fairness demand that he should get an opportunity to contest the said document before it can be used against him. In the circumstances of the case we think an order of remand-was necessary for allowing the additional evidence to be produced and proved in accordance with law. The learned Advocate for the re­spondents has fairly submitted that he does not ob­ject to an order of remand for the said purpose.<br/><br/>14. In the result, therefore, the appeal is al­lowed and the case remanded to the trial court for re­hearing upon allowing the parties to adduce further evidence in respect of the alleged sale of .02-1/2 deci­mals of land to Sona Miah in Sraban, 1382 B.S.<br/>There will be no order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
