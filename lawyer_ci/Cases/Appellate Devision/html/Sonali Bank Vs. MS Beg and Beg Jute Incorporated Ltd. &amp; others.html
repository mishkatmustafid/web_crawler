A. No. 91 of 1987)<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size:20px">Judgment</span></strong><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mustafa Kamal J.- </strong>The question raised in this appeal by leave by the plaintiff appellant Sonali Bank is, whether in the instant mortgage suit for sale the plaintiff is also entitled as of law to a decree for interest both <em>pendente lite</em> and till realization of the decretal amount.<br/><br/>2. The appellant Bank instituted Title Suit No, 31 of 1983 (later re-numbered as Title Suit No. 131 of 1984) originally in the 3<sup>rd</sup> Courts and Commercial Court No. 2, Dhaka which was a suit for recovery of money by sale of mort­gaged property for a preliminary decree for Tk. 14,00,000/- with interest at 20% till realisation with a direction that the Schedule property be sold on failure to pay the decretal amount and to make the preliminary decree final on failure to pay as aforesaid and also praying for a personal decree against the defendants for the said amount. The Commercial Court Decreed that suit for an amount of Tk. 8,85,485.39 payable in quarterly instalments of Tk. 50,000/- but allowed no interest as prayed for, by judgment and decree dated 24-12-86. The appellant Bank took an appeal to the High Court Division, F.A. No. 91 of 1987, against the said decree on the ground that interest on the decretal amount <em>pendente lite</em> and till realization was wrongly refused by the trial Court. By the impugned judgment dated 1-4-90 a Division Bench of the High Court Division dismissed the said appeal holding that the commercial Court had exer­cised its discretion in refusing interest to the plaintiff on the decretal amount on valid ground.<br/><br/>3. Leave was granted to consider "the submission of the appellant that award of inter­est on the decretal amount <em>pendent lite</em> is mandatory available to the plaintiff under Order 34, Rules 2, 4 and 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure in a suit for sale of mortgaged proper­ty. Interest should also have been allowed on the said sum from the date of the decree till realisation of the same. The High Court Division has failed to properly construe order 34 of the Code of Civil Procedure and has failed to properly construe the facts of the present case as also the decisions in the case of <strong><em>Dawoodbhai Kassamji Matiwalla vs. Shaikhali Alibhoy, AIR 1953 (Bom) 445</em></strong> and <strong><em>Kishen Raj vs. Radhalal, AIR 1958 (Rajasthan) 145,</em></strong> cited at the Bar.<br/><br/>4. Defendant No. 1 (respondent No. 1 here­in) is a company carrying on the business of export and buying and selling of jute. Defendant Nos. 2-9 are its Managing Director and Directors who guaranteed the loan unsanctioned by the appellant Bank. Defendant No. 1 was given accommodation by the plaintiff Bank to the extent Tk. 5 lakhs repayable with interest at 2¼% above Bank rate minimum 10½% on 7-4-76 and against pledge of jute goods. The limit was enhanced to Tk. 40 lakhs in 1976-77 against the pledge of jute goods and equitable mortgage of property at Gulshan. The limit was renewed for 1977-78 and 1978-79. In 1979-80 the cash credit limit was reduced to Tk. 20 lakhs with a blocked loan amounting to Tk. 7,36,000/-. As securities of the loan the defen­dants furnished various D.P notes, letters of undertaking, guarantees etc. Upto 20-1-83 there was an outstanding of Tk. 3,69,485.39 in the pledge account and an outstanding sum of Tk. 36.000/- in the blocked loan account, in total an outstanding sum of Tk. 11,05,485.39. The plaintiff claimed interest <em>pendente lite</em>, tenta­tively calculated at Tk. 2,94,514.61 and filed the suit on 24-1-83 for a preliminary decree for Tk. 14 lakhs along with other prayers as already noticed.<br/><br/>5. Defendant Nos. 1 and 3-8 merely stated in their joint written statement that they are willing to negotiate a settlement and after mutu­al accounting repay the plaintiff's just and actu­al dues.<br/><br/>6. During the pendency of the suit the defendants paid a sum of Tk. 2,20,000/- and deducting this amount from the outstanding due of Tk. 11,05,485.39 the trial Court passed a pre­liminary decree under Order 34 Rule 4(1) C.P.C. for a sum of Tk. 8,85,485.39. Interest was refused on the ground that the block loan will not bear any interest as per terms and con­ditions and the plaintiff Bank did not file any proper account of sale of the pledged goods. Besides, the Bangladesh Bank by a Circular dated 19.3.84 waived penal interest charged against the borrower and also it is well settled that the court is not bound by the interest awarded in the contract itself.<br/><br/>7. The High Court Division on appeal held that the instant suit was not a suit for foreclo­sure or redemption of mortgage. It was not a case of award of interest on mortgage money. Hence it was not compulsory to award payment of interest on the decretal amount. The award of interest on the decretal amount <em>pendente lite</em> and from the date of decree till realisation is purely a matter of discretion of the court and the commercial Court has exercised its discretion on valid ground in refusing interest to the plain­tiff.<br/><br/>8. Mr. A. B. M. Khairul Huq, learned Counsel for the appellant Bank has submitted, first, that section 34 of the Code of Civil Procedure gives the court a discretion to award interest <em>pendente lite</em> and from the date of the decree till realisation, but section 34 C.P.C is a general provision which governs only money decrees. Order 34 is a specific provision of the Code of Civil Procedure governing suits relat­ing to mortgages of immovable property. The High Court Division failed to notice Rule 4(1) of order 34 which provides as follows:- <br/>"In a suit for sale, if the plaintiff suc­ceeds, the Court shall pass a prelimi­nary decree to the effect mentioned in clauses (a), (b), and (c) (i) of sub-rule (i) of Rule 2.........together with such amount as may have been adjudged due in respect of subsequent costs, charges, expenses and interest..." <br/><br/>9. Mr. Khairul Huq then refers to Rule 2(1) of Order 34 which is as follows:<br/>"2<strong>.</strong> (1) In a suit for foreclosure, if the plain­tiff succeeds, the Court shall pass a pre­liminary decree-<br/>(a) Ordering that an account be taken of what was due to the plaintiff at the date of such decree for-<br/>(i) principal and interest on the mortgage,<br/>(ii) the costs of suit, if any, awarded to him and (iii) other costs, charges and expenses properly incurred by him up to that date in respect of his mortgage security, together with interest thereon; or <br/>(b) declaring the amount so due at that date; and <br/><br/>10. Mr. Khairul Huq then submits that whether the suit for sale is passed in terms of Rule 2(1) (a) or (b) the amount due to the plain­tiff will consist of the principal and interest on the mortgage "at the date of such decree", in other words, from the date of the institution of the suit till the passing of the decree and the trial court has no option but to award interest <em>pendente lite</em> in a suit for sale.<br/><br/>11. Dr. Rafiqur Rahman, learned Counsel for the respondents, has made a feeble attempt to show that the suit was in fact for a personal decree against the Managing Director and other Directors and that it does not fulfill the charac­teristics of a mortgage suit. Having gone through the plaint and the decree passed in the suit under Order 34 Rule (1) C.P.C we have no manner of doubt whatsoever that this is a mort­gage suit for sale and a preliminary decree has to be drawn up in terms of Rule 4(1), read with Rule 2(1) in the manner mentioned in clauses (a), (b) and (c) (i) thereof. The plaintiff Bank obtained a mortgage by deposit of title deeds. A mortgage by deposit of title deeds being placed on the same footing as a simple mortgage (sec­tion 96 of the Transfer of Property Act) the only remedy is a suit for sale which the plaintiff Bank availed of in the instant case.<br/><br/>12. By Act 21 of 1929 Order 34 of the Code of Civil Procedure was amended and a new Rule 11 was inserted which deals specially with interest. When Rule 11 remained unamended, the Privy Council held in the case of <strong><em>Jagannath Prosad Singh Chowdhury vs. Surajmul Jalal, AIR 1927(PC) 1</em></strong>:- <br/>"Really this matter is determined beyond question by O. 34 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This may, for this particular case of mortgages, differ from the gen­eral provision of S. 34 of the Code, but if so, the particular avoids the general." <br/><br/>13. In other words, what the Privy Council held is that section 34 C.P.C is a general provision with regard to award of interest but order 34 is a specific provision in respect of suits relating to mortgages of immovable property and therefore the particular will exclude the general. In relation to mortgages Order 34 CPC will exclude the provisions of section 34 C.P.C.<br/><br/>14.  After a new Rule 11 was inserted   by Act 21 of 1929 the federal Court had the occa­sion to deal with the question of award of inter­est <em>pendente lite</em> and interest till realisation. It was held by <strong>Sulaiman J.</strong> in the case of <strong><em>Jaigobind Singh Vs. Lachmi Narain Ram, AIR 1940 (FC) 20 </em></strong>as follows: <br/>"It follows that this special provision, which removes any conflict that there might have been between S. 34 and O. 34 Rr. 2 and 4, gives a certain amount of discretion to the court, so far as inter­est <em>pendente lite</em> and subsequent inter­est are concerned. It is no longer absolutely obligatory on the courts to decree interest at the contractual rate upto the date of redemption in all cir­cumstances, if there be no question of the rate being penal, excessive or sub­stantially unfair within the meaning of the Usurious Loans Act, 1918." <br/><br/>15. Before the aforesaid observation of the Federal Court is appreciated it will be useful to quote Rule 11 of Order 34 C. P.C in full, as inserted by Act 21 of 1929.<br/>"<strong>11.</strong> in any decree passed in suit for foreclo­sure, sale or redemption, where interest is legally recoverable, the Court may order payment of interest to the mort­gagee as follows namely:-<br/>(a) interest up to the date on or before which payment of the amount found or declared due is under the preliminary decree to be made by the mortgagor or other person redeeming the mortgage.<br/>(i) on the principal amount found or declared due on the mortgage, at the rate payable on the principal, or, where no such rate is fixed, at such rate as the court deems reasonable,<br/>(ii) on the amount of the costs of the suit awarded to the mortgagee, at such rate as the court deems reasonable from the date of the preliminary decree, and<br/>(iii) on the amount adjudged due to the mortagee for costs, charges and expens­es properly incurred by the mortgagee in respect of the mortgage security upto the date of the preliminary decree and added to the mortgage money at the rate agreed between the parties, or, failing such rate, at the same rate as is payable on the principal, or failing both such rates, at nine percent, per annum; and <br/>(b) subsequent interest upto the date of reali­sation or actual payment at such rate as the Court deems reasonable<br/>(i) on the aggregate of the principal sums specified in clause (a) and of the interest thereon as calculated in accordance with that clause; and<br/>(ii) on the amount adjudged due to the mort­gagee in respect of such further costs, charges and expenses as may be payable under rule 10." <br/><br/>16. It was argued in subsequent cases that as Rule 11 uses the word "the Court may order payment of interest" the award of interest was also discretionary under Rule 11. Reliance was also placed on the afore quoted observation of the Federal Court. But in a series of subsequent cases cited by Mr. A. B. Khairul Huq we find that it has been held that the real import of Rule 11 is that the Court is bound to grant interest upto the decree. Thus in the case of <strong><em>Sukhraj Rai Vs. Ratinath Panjiara, AIR 1942 (Ptatne) 102</em></strong>, it was clearly held that Rule 11 does not affect the Court's power to allow <em>pendent lite</em> interest under order 34 Rule 2. The Federal court did not intend to lay down in the afore cited case that under Rule 11 the Court can refuse <em>pendent lite</em> interest altogether. All that the Federal Court stated is that the Court has a discretion under Rule 11 in the matter of awarding <em>pen­dent lite</em> interest, i.e., a discretion in the rate of interest to be given to the mortgagee.<br/><br/>17. Next, in the case of <strong><em>Dawoodbhia Kassamji Matiwalla Vs. Shaikhali Alibhoy, AIR 1953 (Bom) 445</em></strong> it was held that the posi­tion of law prior to 1929 was that the Court could not deprive the mortgagee of the interest agreed upon till the date fixed for redemption. This decision was based on the principle pro­pounded by the Privy Council in the case previ­ously cited at <strong><em>AIR 1927 (PC) 1,</em></strong> namely, that upto the date of the preliminary mortgage decree and also upto the further period of grace which Court gave to the mortgagor for redeem­ing the mortgage, interest was in the domain of contract and not in the domain of judgment and The Court had no discretion to vary the rate of interest and award to the mortgagee interest less than what the mortgagor had agreed to pay. But after the amendment in 1929 Rule 11 did not make it obligatory upon the court to order pay­ment of interest at the rate agreed upon upto the date fixed for redemption. It gave a discretion to the court to award a reasonable rate of interest. Impliedly it also gave discretion to the Court toward a lesser rate of interest than agreed upon between the mortgagor and the mortgagee. As such Rule 11, after it was inserted by Act 21 of 1929, merely conferred upon the court a discre­tion to vary the rate of interest but not to do away with interest <em>pendent lite</em> altogether while decreeing a mortgage suit.<br/><br/>18. In the case of <strong><em>Nilmoni Sardar Vs. Baidyanath Das Manna, AIR 1957 (Cal) 140</em></strong> the same view was followed, namely, that the Court is bound to decree <em>pendente lite</em> interest, it being left to the discretion of the Court at what rate it is to be allowed. The circumstances of each particular case is to be taken into con­sideration.<br/><br/>19. In the case of <strong><em>Kishen Raj vs. Radhalal, AIR 1958 (Rajasthan) 145</em></strong> the position of law has been summarised in paragraphs 19 and 21 of the report substantially along the lines indi­cated above.<br/><br/>20. In the case of <strong><em>Patel Narharilal Kuberdas vs.  Partners of the Firm of Pari Bhogilal Amratlal, AIR 1963 (Guj) 253</em></strong>, it is again reit­erated that in a case of a suit for the sale of property mortgaged or charged, an account has to be taken of what was due to the plaintiff at the date of such decree as provided in order 34 Rule 2 and Order 34 Rule 4. The court has to take an account of the principal and interest on the mortgage and the amount due to the plain­tiff on the date of the decree. The Court has, therefore, no discretion in the matter of taking accounts of the mortgage, it was, however, con­tended that section 34 overweighed order 34 and that where section 34 gives a discretion to the court that discretion cannot be taken away by order 34. It was rightly held that there was no inconsistency between two. Section 34 gives a discretion to the Court in cases where the court passes a pure money decree. Order 34 leaves no discretion to the Court where the court is dealing with suits under Order 34.<br/><br/>21. Finally, in the case of <strong><em>Laxmi Chand Gangaram vs. Brijbhushandas, AIR 1970 (Madhya Pradesh) 34</em></strong>, more or less the same view with regard to the award of interest and the rate at which interest is to be awarded has been reiterated.<br/><br/>22. It thus appears that the preponderance of judicial decisions in the sub continent is that whether it is suit for foreclosure or for sale the Court has to pass a preliminary decree in terms of Rule 2(1) of Order 34 and that the court has no option but to award interest <em>pendente lite</em> to the mortgagee. In a suit for redemption the prin­ciple is not very different because the prelimi­nary decree therein has to be passed under Order 34 Rule 7 C.P.C which is substantially in the same terms as in Rule 2. The High Court Division was not well founded in law in not being persuaded with the decision cited in <strong><em>AIR 1953 (Bom) 445</em></strong> and <strong><em>AIR 1958 (Rajasthan) 145</em></strong> on the ground that as those were suits for fore­closure and redemption, the principles stated there in are inapplicable in the instant suit. In a suit for sale the preliminary decree is drawn up in the same manner as in a suit for foreclosure.<br/><br/>23. We therefore hold that the High Court Division acted illegally in not holding that the plain­tiff appellant was entitled to interest <em>pendent lite</em>, i.e., from the date of the institution of the suit upto the date of the passing of the decree.<br/><br/>24. Now as for the rate of interest we have already noticed that the court is not obliged under Rule 11 to award the contractual rate of interest while awarding interest <em>pendent lite</em>. Contractual rate of interest was payable accord­ing to the privy Council in the case reported in <strong><em>AIR 1927 (PC)</em></strong> 1 but after the enactment of Act 21 of 1929 the newly inserted Rule 11 of Order 34 gives the Court a discretion in the matter of fixing the rate of interest to be awarded <em>pendente lite</em>. That is the purport of the decision reported in <strong><em>AIR 1940 (FC) 20</em></strong> and the other decisions already noticed.<br/><br/>25. The original agreement between the parties is that the defendants will pay interest at 2¼% above Bank rate, the minimum being 10½%. Subsequently on an extension of the cash credit facilities the rate of interest was increased to 13½%. In the plaint the plaintiff has asked for interest at the rate of 20% <em>pendente lite</em>.<br/><br/>26. At the close of the argument Mr. A. B. M. Khairul Huq has submitted a signed state­ment of accounts on behalf of the appellant Bank which shows that by November, 1990 the respondents have paid off the entire decretal dues by installments. So there remains nothing due from them except the interest <em>pendente lite</em>. It also appears that the Managing Director of the defendant company died on 3-5-83 and after his death the company failed to rune their busi­ness and were thus unable to pay any interest. Even then the decretal amount remains fully paid in 1990. After a passage of 7 years from the satisfaction of the decree we are not inclined to impose the contractual rate of interest upon the judgment debtor. We are of the opinion that the interest of justice will be served if the defen­dants are directed to pay interest at the rate of 6% on the decretal sum with yearly rests from the date of institution of the suit till the date of decree in two equal yearly installments.<br/><br/>27. With regard to interest from the date of decree till realisation we find that the discretion of the Court is even wider in this area and considering the facts and circumstances of this particular case as already noticed we think that no interest should be paid on this score.<br/>The appeal is allowed without any order as to costs. The trial Court is directed to draw up a fresh decree in terms of this judgment.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
