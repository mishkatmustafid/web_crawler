Abdul Matin J. -</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 18.05.2009 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.820 of 1997 against the judg­ment and decree dated 30.10.1996 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, Court No. 2, Jessore in Title Appeal No.239 of 1987 reversing the judgment and decree dated 30.08.1987 passed by the Monirampur Upazila<em> Munsif</em> Adalat, Monirampur, Jessore in Title Suit No.228 of 1984.<br/><br/>2. The facts, in short, are that the respon­dents-opposite party respondent Nos.1-3 as plaintiffs filed Title Suit No.228 of 1984 in the Court of the Monirampur <em>Upazila Munsif Adalat</em>, Monirampur, Jessore impleading the predecessor of the petitioners and other respondents as defendants for declaration of title and con­firmation of possession and <em>khas</em> posses­sion in respect of the suit property.<br/><br/>3. The plaintiffs in the aforesaid Title Suit No.228 of 1984 stated in the pliant that the suit land measuring 35 decimals of land in plot Nos.170, 176 and 178 of<em> mouza</em> bali-adanga of Monirampur Police Station, District-Jessore belonged to C.S. recorded tenant Arjun Muchi and others and one Dakhu Rani was his upper landlord and subsequently one Kashinath purchased her rent receiving interest and took the land as his <em>khas</em> property and thereby S.A. record has been prepared in his name. The plain­tiffs further stated that practically Kashinath did not get possession but Arjun Muchi possessed the suit land and resided therein by creating house till his death and his only son the plaintiff Panchu Gopal Das has been possessing the same. Due to preparation of S.A. record in the name of Kashinath to avoid complexity of law, the plaintiff Panchu Gopal on 22.02.1979 obtained a registered kabala deed from Kashinath and the plaintiff had lawful title over the suit land. The plaintiff further stated that on 15.02.1982 the ADC (Revenue), Jessore passed an illegal order regarding correction of S.A. record and on the basis of that order defendant No.1 threatened the plaintiff with dispossession and accordingly the plaintiff filed the present suit.<br/><br/>4. The predecessor of the present petition­ers and pro-forma-respondent Nos.8 and 9 of the present civil petition for leave to appeal as defendant Nos.1, 6 and 7 in the aforesaid Title Suit No. 228 of 1984 con­tested the suit on filing a joint written statement stating therein in the written statement denying all the material allega­tion made in the plaint and contended, inter-alia, that the suit of the plaintiff is not maintainable in it's present form and man­ner and the same is barred by limitation and the suit land originally belonged to C.S. recorded tenants, Kashinath and oth­ers and thereafter due to arrear of rents the suit land including other undisputed land was sold in auction and the Government purchased the suit land in auction sale vide certificate case No.135 of 1955-56 and thereby the Government went into possession of the suit land including other undisputed land which during S.A. opera­tion was wrongly recorded in the name of Panchu Rishhi and others and for that the <em>Tahsilder,</em> Gopalpur of Monirampur Police Station filed objection Case No. 52 of 1956 under Section 19(1) of the E.B. S.A. and T. Act against the said wrong preparation of S.A. record and that objec­tion case on proper hearing of both sides was allowed and aforesaid initial S.A. record of Panchu Muchi @ Rishi and oth­ers was cancelled and title and possession of the Government to the suit land was established on due cancellation of wrong S.A. Kh.125 of the suit land. Thus when the Government was in peaceful posses­sion with the title as stated above in the suit land and other undisputed land on due inclusion of the same in the Government's S.A. khatian No.1 settled 24 decimals of land from disputed plot No. 170 with an area of 12 decimals, Plot No.178 with a area of 02 decimals and undisputed plot No. 188/698 with an area of 10 decimals to the defendant No.1 vide settlement case No.29/XIII/61-62 on 30.06.1961 on due realisation of salami from the settlement holder, the defendant No.1 on 07.08.1961 and thereby the defendant No.1 on the strength of the aforesaid settlement has mutated his name for the said land on reg­ular payment of rent to the Government and the Government has also executed a registered <em>kabuliyat</em> on 02.01.1979 for the said 24 decimals of land in favour of the defendant No.1. After registration of the aforesaid <em>kabuliyat</em> the plaintiff has creat­ed the so-called collusive <em>kabala </em>dated 22.02.1979 and when the plaintiff on the basis of the said deed dated 22.02.1979 threatened the defendant No.1 to dispos­sess him from the suit land, the defendant No.1 filed Title Suit No.400 of 1983 wherein the defendant No.1 obtained injunction against the plaintiff and the said title suit is still pending in the Monirampur <em>Upazila Munsif</em> Adalat. The defendant Nos.1, 6 and 7 took <em>eksonsa</em> lease from the Government for 04 deci­mals in Plot No.170, 08 decimals in Plot No.176 and 04 decimals in Plot No.178 respectively and the defendant Nos.6 and 7 are residing therein by constructing katcha dwelling houses. S.A. record in S.A. Khatian No.5 is wrong and S.A. Khatian 125 will be cancelled of the mouza concerned and the note is therein the 'working volume' of S.A. record also stands alike. So plaintiff’s case is liable to be dismissed with cost.<br/><br/>5. The Monirampur <em>Upazila Munsif</em> <em>Adalat</em>, Monirampur, Jessore on due con­sideration and assessment of 3(three) P.Ws. and 3 (three) D.Ws. and documents submitted by both the parties in the judg­ment and decree dated 30.08.1987 in Title Suit No.228 of 1984 decreed in part for 21 decimals of land out of total disputed land of 35 decimals in favour of the plaintiff and title and possession of the defendant No.1 over 14 decimals of land in disputed plot Nos.170 and 178 on the basis of aforesaid settlement from Government is affirmed in the said judgment and decree dated 30.08.1987.<br/><br/>6. Thereafter the predecessor of the pres­ent petitioners along with his two full brothers, the present <em>pro forma</em>-respondent Nos.8 and 9 who were defendant Nos.1,6 and 7 in the Title Suit No.228 of 1984 being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid judgment and decree dated 30.08.1987 preferred Title Appeal No.239 of 1987 in the Court of the learned District Judge, Jessore and in that appeal the plain­tiff-respondent Nos.1-3 filed memorandum of cross objection on their behalf and finally on transfer the Title Appeal No.239 of 1987 was heard by the learned Subordinate Judge, Court No.2, Jessore who in his judgment and decree dated 30.10.1996 dismissed the appeal and decreed the suit in full and also granted recovery of <em>khas</em> possession by evicting<em> katcha</em> huts of defendant Nos.1, 6 and 7.<br/><br/>7. As against the judgment of the appellate court the petitioner preferred civil revision before the High Court Division and by the impugned judgment the High Court Division discharged the Rule and affirmed the judgment of the court of appeal below.<br/><br/>8. Being aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court Division the petitioners have preferred this petition for leave to appeal.<br/><br/>9. Heard Dr. Kazi Akter Hamid, the learned Advocate appearing for the peti­tioners and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/><br/>10. It appears that the plaintiff proved that document dated 22.02.1979 which is a registered document from Kashi Nath. The plaintiff constructed dwelling huts thereon and the defendant forcibly con­structed a <em>kacca</em> hut in the eastern side of plot No.178 and therefore the appellate court rightly gave the complete relief by allowing recovery of possession.<br/><br/>11. The defendant adduced 3 D.Ws and D.Ws.2 and 3 admitted the title and pos­session of the plaintiff and hence we find no illegality committed by the courts below in finding possession and title in favour of the plaintiff respondent.<br/>Accordingly the leave petition is dis­missed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
