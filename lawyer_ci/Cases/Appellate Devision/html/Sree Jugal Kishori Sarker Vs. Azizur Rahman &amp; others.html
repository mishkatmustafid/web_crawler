Plaintiff-appellant filed a suit for partition of the <em>ejmali</em> properties with a prayer for purchasing the share of the stranger purchaser, defendants, in the <em>ej­mali</em> undivided family dwelling house situated on plot No. 492 under section 4 of the Partition Act. The suit was numbered as Other Class Suit No. 17 of 1975 in the Court of the Munsif, Sadar, and Rajshahi.<br/><br/>3. The suit property originally belonged to Amritalal, who died leaving two sons Jadav and Madhusudan. Madhusudan then died leaving his only daughter Jugal Kishori, the plaintiff. She had been living in her father's house. Jagabandhu is the heir of Jadav. Jagabandhu transferred his share to defen­dants 3-10, who are strangers to his family. Hence the plaintiff filed the suit.<br/><br/>4. The trial court and the appellate court below found that the plaintiff was in possession of the homestead and there was no previous partition as was claimed by the defendants. The trial court de­creed the suit and that was affirmed by the appellate court below. In revision at the instance of the defen­dants the learned Single Judge of the High Court Di­vision made the rule absolute and remanded the suit to the trial court with the following direction:<br/>"That he shall appoint a suitable pleader commissioner at the cost of the plaintiff lo physically visit the suit land and ascertain the actual quantum of land covered by the dwelling house and the adjunct land which are reasonably necessary for proper and convenient use of the house and also to assess the value thereof and upon the report the learned Munsif shall deter­mine the area of the dwelling house and its val­ue cither on the basis of the said report or on taking evidence of both parties if necessary and thereafter to pass a decree in favour of the plain-tiff according to law and in the light of the ob­servation made above."<br/><br/>5. Leave was granted to consider whether the approach that was made by the High Court Division was correct in view of the nature of the suit and the contention that even if any area is lo be excluded that could be done in the final decree itself but that does not call for setting aside the decree as was done by the High Court Division which would mean un­necessary prolongation of litigation.<br/><br/>6. Mr. S.R. Pal, learned Counsel appearing for the plaintiff-appellant, drew our attention that plot No. 492 measuring 3.71 acres is shown in the khatian as the homestead (Bari). In a suit for partition under section 4 the concept of the dwelling house has been settled by long line of judicial decisions and the learned Single Judge erred in reversing decree and remand it to the trial court as because both the trial court and the appellate court below were conscious that it was mere a preliminary decree and the neces­sary steps may be taken by the Advocate Commis­sioner himself for consideration of the Court, before passing the final decree. Mr. Pal drew our attention to the passage of the appellate court's judgment:<br/>"Here the learned Munsif has asked the Ad­vocate Commissioner to assess the value before passing the final decree. The learned Advocate Commissioner will make investigation as to the value of the property concerned and then submit his report to the Court and the Court will con­sider the report and if it finds that it is accepta­ble it will accept and if it finds not acceptable it will reject ............. .............The procedure staled above may be followed for as­certainment of the value of the property by the learned lower Court before making the final de­cree."<br/><br/>7. Mr. Pal submits that in this state of things there is hardly anything for the High Court Division to revise the orders of the Courts below far less to reverse the decision and remand the case to the trial court.<br/><br/>8. In <em><strong>Subal "Chandra Modak V. Gostha Behari Das, 60 CWN 829</strong></em> a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court observed :-<br/>"When an application under section 4 of the Partition Act comes up for consideration the jurisdiction of the Court is limited to questions relating to the rights of the co-sharers of the original undivided family to compel the stranger transferee to sell to the former the portion of the dwelling-house purchased by the latter. As was pointed out in <em><strong>Boto Krishna Gose v. Akshoy Kumar ghose (54 C.W.N. 660)</strong></em> so long as the dwelling house has not been completely alienat­ed to a stranger the actual position is that it is still an undivided family house and the posses­sion and enjoyment of which are conferred on the members of the family, the stranger transfer­ee being debarred under section 44 of the Trans­fer of Property Act from exercising his right to joint possession which is one of the main inci­dents of co-ownership of property. The Courts have not hesitated to put a liberal construction upon the Partition Act and to interpret its provisions in such a way as would promote and fulfill the object of the Partition Act which is to pre­serve the integrity of the family dwelling house and to enable the members of the family to keep it for themselves as far as possible."<br/>This is a well settled principle of law which has been grounded on the decision given in <em><strong>Nilkamal. V. Kamakshya Charan A. I. R. 1928 Cal. 539</strong></em>. This de­cision has been followed in the subsequent decisions of the Calcutta High Court. The purpose of section 4 is to see that a transferee outsider does not force his way into a dwelling house in which other mem­bers of the transferor's family have a right to live. Once the partition decree is made in preliminary form the rest is for the Commissioner, but the Court at that stage is not concerned as to what direc­tion should be given to the Commissioner for com­pleting the partition. The Calcutta High Court ob­served:<br/>"The Court is not at this stage considering as to what direction should be given to the Commissioner for the final decree for complet­ing partition of all the items of joint property. Giving a direction as regards one of the proper­ties other than the dwelling house will be deal­ing with the part of the case which is not before the Court at that time."<br/>The Court can only give a limited direction after perusing the Commissioner's report as to which plot is to be partitioned. The rest will be decided at the stage when the Commissioner submits his final re­port and the Court proceeds to consider the same. The learned Single Judge unfortunately had fallen into an error in taking into consideration the matters which have not yet been adjudicated by the Court of Munsif.<br/><br/>9. Mr. Fazlul Karim, the learned Counsel at­tempted to argue as to the concept of the dwelling house, it is not necessary for us to make decisive opinion at this stage but it would be sufficient to note in passing that the concept of the dwelling house had received a very liberal interpretation. <em>See</em><strong><em> Damodar v. Banwarilal A.I.R. 1960 Cal. 467</em></strong>. In that case there was intervention of Union Board Road between plots 1473 and 1596. The Court con­sidered that it was matter of little consequence in de­ciding whether the plot No. 1596 was a part of the dwelling house because on evidence it was found that plot No. 1596 was a part of the dwelling house. As to the meaning of dwelling house for the purpose of section 4 it was noticed:<br/>"The terms 'house' or 'dwelling house' are ambiguous terms and for the purpose of S.4 of the Partition Act must be liberally construed. The terms should be taken to mean not only the structure or building but also adjacent buildings, garden, courtyard, orchard, and all that is neces­sary for the convenient occupation of the house. In support of the proposition, we need refer to the following, from amongst numerous deci­sions on the point- <em><strong>Kshirode Chunder v. Sharada Prosad, 12 Cal LJ 525, Pran Krishna v. Keshab Chandra, 22 Cal. CWN 515; (AIR 1919 Cal. 1055, Nilkamal V. Kamakshya Charan, AIR 1928 Cal. 539."</strong></em><br/><br/>10. Keeping in mind these principles there is no hesitation in saying that the learned Single Judge had exceeded the jurisdiction in revision for selling aside the decree and remanding the suit to the trial Court.<br/><br/>11. Mr. Fazlul Karim's grievance that the plain­tiff had inherited 8 annas share only in the dwelling house and the rest 8 annas was purchased by the de­fendant from the co-sharers. It is true that the defen­dant is a purchaser but the law allows under section 4 of the Partition Act the plaintiff to claim for re­purchase of that share because the purpose of the law is to keep away the transferee purchaser from enter­ing into the dwelling house of undivided Hindu fami­ly. Mr. Karim further made a grievance that it is about 12 bigas of land that comprises the plot No. 492 and the plaintiff cannot grab the whole by tak­ing cover under the concept of dwelling house. As has been pointed out that the concept has been given liberal meaning in the long line of decisions it is for the Advocate Commissioner to find out and make necessary arrangement as to how much land is to be partitioned and which way. On his report the final decree is to be drawn. The Court need not say anyth­ing further at this stage and therefore leave the matter at that.<br/>In the result, this appeal is allowed with cost. The judgment of the High Court Division is set aside.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
