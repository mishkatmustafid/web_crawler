Hassan Ameen J.- </strong>This petition for leave to appeal, at the instance of peti­tioner (defendant-plaintiff opposite-parties),is directed against the order dated 30th January, 2006 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.2721 of 2003 allow­ing the application.<br/><br/>2. Facts, leading to this petition, are that the respondent Nos.1 and 2 filed a suit being Other Class Suit No. 102 of 1991 in the 1st Court of Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Rajshahi against the petitioner Nos.1 and 2 and respondent Nos. 3-5 for cancellation of the compromise decree dated 25-10-1998 of Title Appeal No. 251 of 1996 passed by the Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge) Rajshahi and also for a declaration of title stating that the suit land originally belonged to Nitai, Gopal, Nirmal, Ajit, Krishnapada and Subhadra Rani, who sold the suit prop­erties infavour of Sita Nath and Profulla Bala in 1976, who obtained possession. The said Sita Nath and Profulla was hus­band and wife, who had no child there­fore in order to retain the lineage of inheritance they adopted Nitai Chandra Mondal, father of the plaintiff-petition­ers in 1964 and thus Nitai Chandra Mondal came to the house of Sita Nath and remain there and being reared up as son and after the attainment of marriage­able age Nitai Chandra Mondal was married with defendant No.3 and took her to live with Nitai Chandra Mondal in the house of Sita Nath. Thereafter, Sita Nath died leaving adopted son Nitai Chandra Mondal and his wife Profulla Bala. After the death of Sita Nath under advice of local Matbars, Profulla Bala registered a deed of gift in favour of plaintiffs on 09-12-1982. Thereafter, Profulla Bala died leaving Nitai Chandra Mondal and he (plaintiff) used to posses the suit properties exclusively to the exclusion of defendant opposite-parties for more than 12 years. The defendant-opposite-party Nos.1 and 2 with a view to grab the suit properties filed a suit being Other Class Suit No. 238 of 1983 in the Court of Munsif, Sadar at Rajshahi giving a false state­ment that they are close relations of Sita Nath and Profulla Bala and created a forged deed. Thereafter, the suit was transferred in the Court of Assistant Judge at Pabna and was renumbered as Other Class No.279 of 1984 and the suit was dismissed on contest. Thereafter, defendant-opposite-parties preferred an appeal being Title Appeal No.249 of 1986 and then during the pendency of the appeal Nitai Chandra Mondal died leaving 2 sons and a wife and 4 daugh­ters. When Nitai Chandra Mondal died then the plaintiff petitioners were minors and as such guardian of the minors and mother, defendant No.3 used to contest the appeal. During the period their mother, became morally weak and she acted against the benefit of the minors and that the minors became day labourer and they were reared up as ser­vant in other family and their mother changed religion and acted to the deter­ment of the interest of the minors and their mother was a widow, illiterate, immoral and later on changed religion and for that she acted in the hands of the defendants and then defendants were able to allure her and obtained a fraudu­lent solenama. She was not given inde­pendent advice. On 25-03-1991, a man of defendant No.1 disclosed that the Title Appeal No. 249 of 1986 was decreed in favour of the defendants on compromise then the petitioners came to know that very soon the defendants would take possession of the suit prop­erties. Thereafter, they obtained the cer­tified copy of the sole decree dated 15-10-1989 and filed the suit.<br/><br/>3. The defendant-petitioner Nos. 1 and 2 contested the suit by filing joint written statement denying all the material aver­ments of the plaint and alleged that the suit is not maintainable in its present form, the suit is barred by limitation and also bad for defect of parties. The spe­cific case of the defendant-opposite-party Nos. 1 and 2, in short, is that the suit land originally belonged to Nitai, Gopal, Nirmal, Ajit, Krishnapada and Subhadra, who sold the suit properties by registered kabala dated 18-12-1996 in favour of their maternal aunt of the defendants and she after purchase erect­ed dwelling house, paid rent and pos­sessed for her. The said Profulla Bala while constructing his house gifted the suit properties in their favour and deliv­ered possession and thereafter, they completed the unfinished work of con­structions by their own money. Profulla Bala on 24-08-1982 executed a deed of gift and registered on 21-12-1982. After execution of the deed her hand was frac­tured and for that before 21-12-1982 she could riot register the deed and in this way the defendants acquired title. On 28-02-1983, Profulla Bala died issue less and these defendants performed all the funeral functions of Profulla Bala. The plaintiff’s father tried to dispossess the defendants and then the defendants filed Title Suit No.238 of 1983 and thereafter, the suit was transferred in the Assistant Judge, Puba and was renumbered as 279 of 1984 and the same was dismissed. Then the defendant preferred an appeal before the District Judge, Rajshahi being Title Appeal No.249 of 1986 which was transferred in the Court of Additional District Judge, 1st Court, Rajshahi and then the mother of the plaintiff-defendant No.3 of that suit on behalf of her minor sons and daughters compromised the suit for their benefit and as such the suit was decreed on compromise in favour of the defendant-opposite-parties and the mother of the plaintiff-defendant No. 3 took Tk.60,000/- as soletium. The plaintiffs have got no title and possession and therefore the suit is liable to be dis­missed with costs.<br/><br/>4. The trial Court upon examining both oral and documentary evidence on record decreed the suit against which, the defendant-petitioners preferred an appeal being Title Appeal No. 251 of 1996 and the plaintiff respondent pre­ferred another appeal being Title Appeal No. 25 of 1997 and both the appeals were heard analogously by the Additional District Judge, Rajshahi, who upon hearing both sides allowed the Title Appeal No. 251 of 1996 and dismissed the Title Appeal No. 25 of 1997.<br/><br/>5. Being aggrieved and dissatisfied by the aforesaid appellate judgment, the plaintiff-respondents moved the High Court Division by preferring Civil Revision No.2721 of 2003 and obtained Rule on 06-07-2003.<br/><br/>6. Added-petitioner-respondent No.6 filed an application for addition of party before the High Court on 12-04-2005 and Mohammad Asaduzzaman (Khairul) son of added petitioner-respondent No.6 filed another applica­tion for addition of party which is pend­ing for hearing. The learned Judges of the High Court Division passed an order that the application for addition of party would be kept with the record and would be considered at the time of Rule hearing of the aforesaid Civil Revision. Thereafter, the High Court Division dis­charged the Rule of the instant Civil Revision No. 2721 of 2003 for non-pros­ecution on 23-10-2005.<br/><br/>7. The added petitioner-respondent No.6 filed an application for recalling the order dated 23-10-2005 before the High Court Division on 20-11-2005.The defendant-petitioners field a counter affidavit on 29-10-2006 against the above-mentioned application for recall­ing the order. The learned Judges of the High Court Division heard both the par­ties and pleased to recall the order dated 23-10-2005 and added the respondent No.6 as petitioner No.3 in the revisional application. Hence, this leave-petition.<br/><br/>8. Syed Mahbubur Rahman, the learned Advocate-on-Record appearing for the petitioners, submits that the instant Civil Revision was legally and finally disposed of on 23-10-2005 and as such the High Court Division had become <em>functus officio</em> and thereby the application for recalling the order is not legally maintainable and <em>per se</em> the impugned order is bad in law and as such the same is liable to be set aside for ends of justice. Learned Advocate fur­ther submits that the applicant-respon­dent No.6 was not a party of the instant Civil Revision and as such, he had no locus standi to file an application for recalling the order dated 23-10-2005 and per se the said application is not legally maintainable in law and thereby the impugned order is bad in law and as such the same is liable to be set aside for ends of justice. He lastly submits that a transfer of the land in suit being subject matter of a pending suit is hit by the doctrine of <em>lis pendens</em> and as such a transfer is not valid in law and conse­quently such a transferee can not apply under order 1 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure to be impleaded as a party to the suit and as such the impugned order is bad in law and there­by the same is liable to be set aside for ends of justice.<br/><br/>9. We have heard the learned Advocate-on-Record and perused the materials available on record and reasons to believe that the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioners has got no merit and accordingly, the same is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
