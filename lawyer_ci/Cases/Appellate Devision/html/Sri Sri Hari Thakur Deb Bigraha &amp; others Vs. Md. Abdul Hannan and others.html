M. Ruhul Amin J. -</strong> This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 11th May, 2004 passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 2939 of 1994 making the Rule absolute.<br/><br/>2. The plaintiff filed Other Class Suit No.215 of 1985 in the Court of Assistant Judge, Sadar, Rajshahi for declaration that the plaintiff has already acquired good and indefeasible title in the suit land as described in schedule 'B', a part of the schedule 'A' of the plaint, by adverse possession for more than long 12 years in respect of 0.1164 acres of land with all pucca houses thereon appertaining to C.S 'Khatian No. 517, S.A, Khatian No. 504, R.S Khatian No.552 corresponding to C.S. Plot No. 816, S.A. Plot No.1250 and R.S. Plot Nos. 4080 and 4081 out of 0.1687 acre situated within Mouza Seriol, P.S. Boalia District Rajshahi. The case of the plaintiff in short, is that the property originally belonged to one Moni Dasi who established a family deity Sree Hari Thakur Deb Bigraha to her said house and constituted herself as the Shebait of the said deity and accordingly during C.S. operation, the entire land mentioned in schedule-A to the plaint was recorded as such. Shebait Moni Dasi died childless and according to her oral direction the Brahmin Porohit, Jotisth Chandra Chakraborty, became the Sheoait for the said debuttar property. Shebait Jotish Chandra Chakraborty died leaving behind his two sons namely Lakshmi Narayan Chakraborty and Rajeswar Chakraborty and only daughter Charushila Rani Chakraborty and all of them have been living in the said house situated on the 'A' schedule property. Subsequently Rajeshwar Chakraborty, the youngest son of Jotish Chandra Chakraborty who is the present plaintiff, embraced Islam in 1962 and adopted the Islamic name Md. Abdul Hannan. In view of such conversion of the plaintiff, a very strained relationship cropped up between the plaintiff and the members of his parents' family. The plaintiff also removed the said deity from the "Thakur Ghar" situated on the suit plot. The plaintiff is in continuous peaceful possession in the suit land and the existence of the deity completely ceased. While the plaintiff had been in possession of the said land of schedule 'B', the liberation war started in the year 1971 when his parents and elder brother, the defendant No. 5, embraced Islam but his father was lifted away and killed by the Pak Army and his dead body could not be traced out.<br/>3. Thereafter, the plaintiff's mother died as a Muslim in 1976 and she was buried in the suit plot. The plaintiff and his elder brother Lakshmi Narayan Chakraborty who also on embracing Islam adopted the Islamic name of Abdur Razzaque, remained in possession of the suit plot in their specific portion. The plaintiff has been paying Municipal taxes separately for his portion as a separate holding. The plaintiff's elder brother Abdur Razzaque the defendant No.5 renounced Islam in 1982 and adopted his original name Lakshmi Narayan to grab the entire property. The plaintiff's elder brother himself filed a case before the Circle Officer (Revenue), Paba, Boalia Circle Rajshahi for mutation of his name in respect of the entire suit plot as Shebait but on objection raised by the plaintiff, the said mutation proceeding was dropped. Thereafter the said elder brother instigated and set up other persons to file a petition before the A.D. C. (Rev), Rajshahi on 18.07.1985 on false claim to appoint a Shebait of the 'A' schedule land treating the same to be public debuttar property of the Hindu People in general. As a result a cloud was cast upon the title of the plaintiff. Hence is the suit.<br/><br/>4.  The defendant Nos.4-5 contested the suit by filing written statement denying the material allegations made in the plaint contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit is barred by law and the suit property is a debuttar property and the suit property belonged to Sree Sree Hari Thakur Deb Bigaha and the C.S., S.A. and R.S. records were prepared in the name of the deity. The plaintiff has no right, title and possession in the suit land since the plaintiff embraced Islam and lived in another house other than the suit land and got married in Nawabganj and lived there.<br/><br/>5. The defendant Nos.1-3 contested the suit by filing written statement denying material allegation but their points of contest are similar to those of the defendant Nos.4 and 5.<br/><br/>6. The trial court decreed the suit. On appeal being Title Appeal No. 6 of 1990, the court of appeal allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit. Being aggrieved, the plaintiff moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained the Rule. The High Court Division upon hearing made the Rule absolute.<br/><br/>7. We have heard Mr. Harendra Nath Nondi, the learned Advocate for the petitioner and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/><br/>8. It is not disputed that the plaintiff embraced Islam and his mother also embraced Islam. It is in evidence that his mother died in 1976 in the suit land and she was buried in the suit land and no objection was raised by the defendant No.5 and the Hindu Community.<br/><br/>9. It is clear that from the evidence of D.W.1 and D.W.2 and also from the evidence of D.W.4 that the plaintiff has been in possession of the suit land measuring 2½  kathas of “Mandirghar”. The High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials on record held that, the plaintiff has been able to prove his continuous, uninterrupted and hostile possession in the suit land for over 12 years and accordingly held that good and indefeasible title by adverse possession has accrued in favour of the plaintiff and accordingly made the rule absolute.<br/>We are of the view that the High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision. There is no cogent reason to interfere with the same.<br/>Accordingly, the leave petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
