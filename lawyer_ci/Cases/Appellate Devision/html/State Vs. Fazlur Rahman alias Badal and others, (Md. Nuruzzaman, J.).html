In view of the discussion of the vivid testimony of the witnesses it clearly appears that the prosecution witnesses P.Ws.2, 4, 6 and 14 categorically proved the prosecution case and the police personnel who investigated the case appeared before the Court as witness who also in same voice supported the prosecution case.

On perusal of the 164 statement of the accused Tutul and testimony of the P.Ws.2 and 4, we are of the view that the testimony of P.Ws.2 and 4 not only supports the statement made by the accused Tutul under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure <span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt;">but those corroborates the same. It is also proved that confessional statement was voluntary</span> and true and properly recorded by Mr. Narayan Chandra Das, Metropolitan Magistrate, P.W.3, in accordance with law.

Upon receipt of such information, the informant rushed there and searched the victim but to no effect. At around 11.00 P.M. someone informed him that the victim had been shifted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. He, therefore, rushed to that hospital, wherein Rustom Ali (P.W.4) and Badsha Mia (P.W.2) told him that on the same day i.e. 02.06.1998 at around 7.30 P.M. they, along with victim Rony were going on by rickshaw towards Jatrabari from Kazlarpar and when they reached near a garage some 5/6 unknown young men stopped their rickshaw and abducted them with intent to kill them. At one stage, Rustom Ali (P.W.4) managed to escape from the clutches of those accused persons and informed the fact to his locality. That the accused persons took Badsha and Rony crossing a Marsh to a place wherein the accused persons fastened a rope on the neck of Rony, they pulled the rope on the neck of Rony and also inflicted assaults on his person.

However, for the purpose of drawing a conclusion and to find out the truth we have gone through the judgment of the High Court Division. It appears that the High Court Division did not assess the testimony of P.Ws.2, 4 and 14 correctly, rather, it relied upon the others P.Ws. who neither saw the occurrence nor was present in the place of occurrence. On perusal of the testimony of P.Ws.2, 4 and 14 as discussed above we are of the view that the High Court Division erred in law in not discussing the vital portion of the testimony of P.Ws.2 and 4 who are the eye witnesses of the occurrence and P.W.14 who recovered the body of the deceased Rony from the place of occurrence with a rope around his neck which has been marked as material exhibit-I and P.W.1 correctly produced and recognized the material exhibit-I, that is, the rope by which the throat and neck of Roni was fastened. P.W.2 in his deposition very vividly disclosed the occurrence of killing Rony by the convict Tutul, son of Mannan Fakir and Fazlur Rahman alias Badal. According to his testimony it appears that the rope was fastened arround the neck and throat of the deceased Rony and tied up by which Rony was killed in presence of witnesses P.W. No.2-Badsha Miah, who saw the occurrence in his own eyes. P.W.14-Nayak Rafiqul Islam who along with others rescued the body of the deceased Rony from the place of occurrence, which is a dry land surrounded by the water. P.W.2-Badsha was present at the place of occurrence who witnessed the killing of the deceased Rony by the accused Fazlur Rahman Badal and Tutul who categorically stated that “</span><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: MoinaNormal; mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">l¢n ¢c­u gy¡p ®cu HC Bp¡j£àu gSm¤l lqj¡e h¡cm Hhw V¥V¥m</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">”.

On perusal of the 164 statement of the accused Tutul and testimony of the P.Ws.2 and 4, we are of the view that the testimony of P.Ws.2 and 4 not only supports the statement made by the accused Tutul under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure <span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt;">but those corroborates the same.

In spite of such evidence being on record the High Court Division has entertained imaginary doubts and concluded that ‘evidences are dubious and as such, the guilt of the accused are not conclusively proved’. The High Court Division overlooked that the law does not require conclusive proof; but only proof beyond reasonable doubt. Besides, the High Court Division has failed to take into consideration that the body of the deceased Rony was recovered by police from the dry land which was surrounded by water at the information of P.W. No.4 which is clearly corroborative by the testimony of the P.W.2 Badsha Mia.</span></p><p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-style: italic;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">37.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">More so, P.W.14 Nayek Md. Rafiqul Islam has clearly deposed in Court regarding the recovery of the body of the deceased Rony, from the place of occurrence at the direction of Badsha P.W.2, and brought the same to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital wherein the Doctor declared that Rony is dead. He informed the occurrence to the Demra Police Station and handed over the corpus to the Demra Police at the Dhaka Medical. It is, therefore, proved that the prosecution story is true and proved beyond the shadow of reasonable doubts that accused persons abducted Rony, Badsha and Rustom. Thereafter, the accused Fazlur Rahman Badal and Tutul killed Rony in front of P.W.2 Badsha, who was also abducted and kept tied at place of occurrence.</span></p><p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-style: italic;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">38.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">Since we are dealing with an appeal against acquittal.

Therefore, the judgment and order so far it relates to acquitting the accused Badal and Tutul is liable to be set aside.
