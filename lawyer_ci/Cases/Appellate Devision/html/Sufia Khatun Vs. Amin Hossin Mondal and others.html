Ruhul Amin J.- </strong>This is an appeal of one of the plaintiffs, by leave, against the judg­ment and order dated February 5, 1997 of a Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 59 of 1986 (Jessore)/Civil Revision No. 6061 of 1991 (Dhaka) making the Rule absolute and thereupon dismissing the suit upon reversing the judgment and decree dated September 3, 1985 of the Court of Additional District Judge, Chuadanga-Meherpur, Station at Chuadanga passed in Title Appeal No. 26 of 1984 affirming those of dated June 30, 1980 of the Court of Munsif (now Assistant Judge) Chuadanga, passed in Title Suit No. 541 of 1970 decreeing the same. The suit was filed seeking declaration of title and confirmation of possession in the land in suit and for further declaration that the decree obtained in Title Suit No. 616 of 1969 of the Court of Munsif, Chuadanga is fraudulent, collusive and not binding upon the plaintiff.<br/><br/>2. Facts, in short, are that the land in suit belonged to Bishnupada and he granted power of Attorney to Danesh Mondal as regard the property in suit and the said attorney transferred the land in suit on December 10, 1953 to his wife defendant No. 3, Parichan Bibi who then transferred the land in suit on June 6, 1963 to the plaintiff No. 1 and the plaintiff No. 1 sold the land to the plaintiff No. 2 Sufia Khatun. It is the specific case of the Plaintiff No. 1 that defendant Nos. 1 and 2 had and have no right, title, interest and possession in the land in suit and the judgment obtained in Title suit No. 616 of 1969 relating to the land in suit was collu­sive, fraudulent and not binding upon the plain­tiff.<br/><br/>3. The suit was contested by the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 by filing joint written statement denying the material averments made in the plaint taking the general pleas that the suit as framed was not maintainable and the plaintiffs have no cause of action to file the suit. The case of the contesting defendants was that defendant No. 1 took settlement of the land from Bishnupada and got possession, that the land was wrongly recorded in the name of the defen­dant No. 3 Parichan Bibi and as such Title Suit No. 616 of 1969 was filed and the same was decreed on compromise in terms of the solehnama, that defendant No. 3 earlier filed Title Suit No. 199 of 1962 against the defendant No. 1 and others seeking recovery of possession in respect of the land in suit but the same was dis­missed for default. It was also the case of the defendants that Bishnupada did not grant any general Power of Attorney to Danesh Mondal, that Danesh Mondal and his wife defendant no. 3 had never possessed the land in suit, that plaintiff No. 1 was the lisencee of the defen­dant No. 1 in a portion of the suit property and the plaintiff No. 1 has brought the suit on the basis of fabricated documents and as such the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>4. The trial Court decreed the Suit on the findings that Bishnupada granted general power of Attorney dated 18.5.1953 (Ext. 1) in favour of Danesh Mondal and no material was placed on record from the side of the defendants to rebut the genuineness of the registered Power of Attorney, that Ext. 1 Ext. 2 (kabala dated 28. 12.1953 by Bishnupada transferring the land in suit and other lands to his wife Parichan Bibi, defendant No. 3) and Ext. 2A (kabala dated 2.8.1963 by the defendant No. 3 in favour of the plaintiff No. 1) amply prove title of the plaintiff No. 1 in the land in suit, that the judgment and decree in Title Suit No. 616 of 1969 is collu­sive, fraudulent and not binding upon the plain­tiff that no cogent evidence has been brought on record in support of the case of the defendant No. 1 that plaintiff No. 1 is his lisencee in a por­tion of the land, that defendants have no posses­sion in the land in suit, that the dakhilas filed by the defendants in support of their claim of tak­ing settlement have not been proved by the competent independent and disinterested wit­ness and as such no reliance can be placed on these dakhilas, that the plaintiff No. 1 has right, title, interest and possession in the land in suit and as such the plaintiff No. 1 is entitled to get reliefs as prayed for.<br/><br/>5. The heirs of defendant No. 1, Nabisuddin, went on appeal. The appellate Court on independent discussion and consideration of the evidence upon arriving at the findings that the dakhilas, some of those are as regard korfa settlement from Parichan Bibi and some of those show settlement from Bishnupada, were not proved by the defendants in support of their claim of taking settlement, that plaintiffs were able to prove their case and that the solenama on the basis of which Title Suit No. 616 of 1969 claimed to have been decreed was not proved, that plaintiffs, have proved their possession in the land in suit affirmed the judgment and decree of the trial Court.<br/><br/>6. Some of the heirs of defendant No. 1, Nabisuddin, moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and obtained Rule. The High Court Division made the Rule absolute on the findings that plaintiff No.1’s vendor Parichan Bibi (defendant No. 3) was out of pos­session at the time of purchase by the plaintiff No. 1, that from the evidence of P.W. 3 (son of defendant No. 3 ) it is seen that the plaintiff is out of possession, that from the evidence of P.W 3 it appears that one Noor Baksha residing in a portion of the suit land and that from the evidence of P.W. 4 it is seen that his sons Iman and Ibrahim are in possession of a portion of the suit land by purchase from defendant No. 2 and they have not been impleaded in the suit and as such the suit is bad for defect of parties, that the finding of the courts below as regard the solehnama is not acceptable since "the soleh decree of the court should not be lightly brushed aside" and that as the Parichan Bibi dur­ing her life time or her son P.W. 3 did not chal­lenge the soleh decree, that the judgment and decree of the courts below is based " on mis­reading and non reading and non consideration of the evidence of (sic) record" and thus the appellate court has "arrived at an erroneous decision and this calls for interference by this court".<br/><br/>7. The law is now settled as to the extent of jurisdiction of the High Court Division under Section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure to interfere with the judgment of the Court of fact i.e. court below. The High Court Division in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction is com­petent to interfere with the judgment of court below only when there is misreading and non consideration of evidence or there is miscon­struction of document but when there is no misreading or non-consideration of the evidence or when there is no misconstruction of document the High Court Division is not competent to interfere with the judgment of the court below. In the instant case the courts of fact i.e. the appellate court and the trial court on detailed discussion and consideration of the evidence arrived at the findings that the plaintiff No. 1 has right, title, and possession in the land in suit and the defendants' cases of taking settlement has not been proved and the dakhilas filed by the defendants in support of the case of taking settlement of the land in suit were not proved by competent independent and disinterested wit­ness.<br/><br/>8. The High Court Division reversed the finding arrived at by the Courts below as regard the soleh decree obtained by the defendant No. 1 in Title Suit No. 616 of 1969 on the view that the soleh decree passed by a Court should not be lightly brushed aside and that the soleh decree was not challenged by defendant No. 3 or by his son P.W. 3. But as it appears the trial Court called for the record of the Title Suit No. 616 of 196 and did not find the solehnama in the record. This was one of the reasons for not considering the compromise genuine.<br/><br/>9. It may be mentioned that plaintiff No. 1 acquired title in the land in suit in August 1963 by the registered kabala (Ext. 2A) from Parichan Bibi. In the afore state of the matter there was no occasion for the defendant No. 1 to file the Title Suit NO. 616 of 1969 impleading Parichan Bibi as regard the land in suit and as Parichan Bibi divested her title in the land in suit back in 1963, she had no occasion to enter into compromise with the defendant No. 1 as regard the land in suit. The trial Court considered the evidence of P.W. 3, son of defendant no. 3, who categorically stated that the sum­mons of Title Suit No. 616 of 1969 was not served on defendant No. 3 and the defendant No. 3 did not execute any solehname. The trial Court considered P.W. 3 as reliable witness. The High Court Division while considering the solehname as genuine placed reliance on the evidence of D.W. 3 clerk of the learned Advocate who said to have represented Parichan Bibi in Title Suit 616 of 1969. D.W.3 has stated that he wrote the solehname and that a solehnama was filed in the suit and that Parichan Bibi compromised the suit. The above evidence of D.W. 3 is not of the kind which can be considered to have proved the fact Parichan Bib singed the so called solehnama on the basis of which compromise between her and defen­dant No. 1 said to have entered into. In view of the evidence of P.W.3 as noted hereinbefore, the High Court Division was required to assign rea­son for discarding the evidence of said witness before placing reliance on the D.W. 3 whose evidence had in no way dislodged the credibili­ty of the evidence of P.W. 3 as regard non gen­uineness of the solehnama. The High Court Division in our view was in serious error in reversing the finding of possession of the land in suit by the plaintiff arrived at on considera­tion of the evidence by the appellant court and the trial Court without recording any finding that the finding of possession as regard the land in suit arrived at by the courts below was based on mis-reading or non-consideration of evi­dence. The High Court Division in setting aside the finding of possession arrived at by the courts below placed reliance on a portion of the averments made in paragraph 3 of the plaint which reads as "অতঃপর নিলিশী জমি ৩ নং প্রতিবাদিনী খাসে দখল করার কোন আশা নাই বুঝিয়া সন ১৩৭০/২২ শে জৈষ্ঠ ইং ৬/৬/৬৩ ইং তারিখে বাদিনী বরাবর রেজিস্টার্ড কব্লা মুলে বিক্রয় করিয়া দেন” and thereupon held that it was clear from the said averment made in para­graph 3 of the plaint that Parichan Bibi, defen­dant No. 3 vendor of the plaintiff No. 1 was out of possession at the time of purchase by the plaintiff No. 1 With due respect to the High Court Division the averment in the plaint as quoted above upon which reliance has been placed by it in arriving at the finding that at the time of transfer by Parichan Bibi to the plaintiff No. 1, plaintiff's vendor was not in possession seriously erroneous in that the said averment does in no way imply or convey that the vendor of the plaintiff transferred the land while she (the vendor) was not in possession. The finding of the High Court Division as regard the posses­sion of the land in suit is not legally well found­ed.<br/><br/>10. The learned Advocate-on-record repre­senting the Respondent Nos. 1-15 placed the entire paragraph 3 of the plaint and thereupon felt difficulty to support the finding of the High Court Division as made upon placing reliance on a portion of the averment (as quoted above) made in paragraph 3 of the plaint as regard the possession of the land in suit by plaintiff No. 1's vendor at the time of transfer to the plaintiff. Since the finding of the Courts of fact as regard the possession of the land in suit is based on due consideration of the evidence the High Court Division was in error in reversing the said find­ing of fact with the general observation the Courts below "on misreading and non-reading and non-consideration  of the evidence of record" reached erroneous decision. The judg­ment under appeal lacks discussion in what respect and in what manner the last court of fact misread, non read and non considered the evi­dence on record relating to possession of the parties in the suit while arriving at the finding that the plaintiffs are in possession of the land in suit.<br/><br/>11. The case of the defendant No. 1 was that he took settlement from Bishnupada through the dakhilas. The courts of fact held that the dakhilas so filed were not proved by the compe­tent, independent and disinterested witness. This aspect of the case reasonable leads one to question the genuineness of the soleh decree obtained in Title suit No. 616 of 1969 or in other words how far the soleh decree is genuine. The High Court Division, with due respect, while considering the soleh decree lost sight of the fact that plaintiff No. 1's acquisition of title in the land in suit was found by the courts below to have been proved. The High Court Division proceeded with the proposition that soleh decree passed by a Court should not be lightly brushed aside although the appellant Court and the trial Court on consideration of the evidence arrived at the finding that the sole decree was not a genuine one. From the defen­dants side except D.W. 3 whose evidence does in no way established that Parichan Bibi filed the solehnama, no other evidence was brought on record to establish that Parichana Bibi was a party to the compromise said to have been made in the Title Suit No. 616 of 1969. The High Court Division did not notice the fact that Parichan Bibi (defendant No. 3) divested her title in the land in suit which she acquired from Danesh Mondal, the attorney of Bishnupada, as back as in 1963 and as such in the year 1969 she had no interest in the land in suit and as such there was no occasion for her to compromise the Title Suit No. 616 of 1969 filed by the defendant No. 1.<br/><br/>12. The High Court Division set aside the judgment of the Court of appeal below holding plaintiffs suit was bad for defect of parties i.e. for non impleading the persons whose names transpired in the course of recording evidence and they claimed to be in possession of the land in suit. The trial Court on consideration of the evidence of P.W.s and the evidence of D.W. Nos. 1, 4 and 5 held that defendant No. 1 has no possession in the land in suit. The appellate court has affirmed the finding of possession of the land in suit by the parties in the suit. The High court Division while not accepting the finding as regard possession of the land in suit is quite silent as to that the said finding of fact arrived at by courts of fact either was not based on evidence or the finding was made on non consideration or misreading of evidence as regard the said fact. In that state of the matter High Court Division was in error in embarking upon for fresh assessment of evidence on the point uniformly decided by the courts below.<br/><br/>13. Law requires that the objection as to non-impleading of party is to be taken "at the earliest possible opportunity". From the defen­dants side neither at the trial nor in the appeal any objection as to non-joinder of party was raised. Also in the revisional application no ground relating to non-joinder of the party was raised, it appears for the first time in the course of hearing of the Rule question of non-joinder of the party was raised.<br/><br/>14. The provision of order 1, Rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as: <br/>"No suit shall be defeated by reason of the mis-joinder or non-joinder of par­ties, and the court may in every suit deal with the matter in controversy so far as regards the rights and interests of the parties actually before it." <br/><br/>15. The plaintiff filed the suit seeking dec­laration of title and confirmation of possession in the land in suit and for a further declaration that the judgment and decree in Title Suit No. 616 of 1969 is fraudulent, collusive, and not binding on the plaintiff. The defendant No. 1 claimed title and possession in the land in suit. It is seen from the judgment of the High Court Division that neither the defendant No. 1 nor the contesting defendants are in possession of the land in suit. The Courts of fact concurrently held that the defendants have no title and pos­session in the land in suit. In the background of the materials on the record it is manifestly clear that the contest as regard the subject matter of the suit is between the plaintiffs and the defen­dant No. 1. In that view of the matter as per pro­vision of order 1 Rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as quoted hereinabove, in the instant matter the Court was required to deal with the matter of controversy so far as regards the rights and interests of the parties actually before it' i.e. in the background of the facts of the case and in the background of the contention of the contesting parties in the suit the court was required to deal with the matter in controversy in the context of right and interest of the plain­tiff and the contesting defendant Nabisuddin or his heirs and none else. The settled principle of law is that a suit shall not fail for reason of mis-joinder or non-joinder of the arties. This Division in the case of <strong><em>Safaruddin and others Vs. Fazlul Huq and others</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>49 DLR (AD) 151</em></strong> has held, "no suit can fail by reason merely of non-joinder of parties. Order 1, Rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure makes this legal posi­tion clear". The High Court Division was in error in entertaining submission as to the matter of non-joinder of the parties made for the first time in the course of argument before it inspite of not taking any ground in there visional appli­cation. Since the defendants in the background of the material as relied upon before the High Court Division had the opportunity before the trial Court as well as in the" appeal to take the plea that the suit was bad for defect of parties and they having had not done so before the courts below they thereby in fact waived the objection as regard the non-joinder of parties (Order 1, Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure). The question of suit being bad for defect of parties was not well founded one since courts below on due consideration of the evi­dence held defendants are not in possession of the land in suit.<br/>In the background of the discussions made hereinabove we find merit in the appeal.<br/>Accordingly the appeal is allowed.<br/>There is no order as to cost.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
