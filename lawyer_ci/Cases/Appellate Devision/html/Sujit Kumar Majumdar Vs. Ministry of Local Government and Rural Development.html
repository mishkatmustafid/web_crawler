He challenged his order of dismissal from service before the Administrative Tribunal, Bogra in Administrative Tribunal Case No. 3 of 1992. The case was allowed in part on 16-6-93 reinstating the petitioner in his service without granting any financial benefits. This order of the Administrative Tribunal, Bogra was upheld by the Administrative Appellate Tribunal, Dhaka in Administrative Appellate Tribunal Appeal No. 58 of 1993 on 7-8-94.<br/><br/>2. This petition for leave to appeal is against the refusal of both the tribunals below to grant financial benefits to the petitioner while reinstating him in service and refusal to grant pay and financial benefits for the period from the date of his dismissal from service to the date of reinstatement in service.<br/><br/>3. From the judgment of the Administrative Appellate Tribunal it appears that the impugned order of dismissal of the petitioner from service was set aside as a major penalty of dismissal was imposed without giving any second show cause notice to the petitioner. Consequently, he was reinstated in service but the financial benefits were not granted as the conduct of the petitioner was unfair as without prior permission of the authority the petitioner remained absent from his duty and further he could not substantiate by producing any material evidence that he was suffering from serious illness. In the facts of the present case although the tribunals below reinstated the petitioner in service, yet they thought it fit and proper not to allow him any financial benefits as his conduct was unfair. Further, the petitioner also cannot claim the financial benefit as a matter of right. The Administrative Appellate Tribunal committed no illegality in passing the impugned judgment.<br/><br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>
