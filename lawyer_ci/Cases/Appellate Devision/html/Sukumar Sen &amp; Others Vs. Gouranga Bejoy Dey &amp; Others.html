T. M. Afzal J.-</strong>This is a plaintiffs' appeal by leave and directed against judgment and or­der dated 2 February 1988 passed by a Single Judge of the High Court Division, Chittagong Bench in re­vision upholding an order of remand of the First Ap­pellate Court.<br/><br/>2. Facts of the case, briefly, are that the plain­tiffs filed other Suit No. 24 of 1984 in the Court of Assistant Judge, Boalkhali Upazila, for declaration of their title to and recovery of khash possession of the suit land. The plaintiffs alleged that the disputed land originally belonged to one Jamini Kanta Sen who bequeathed the same to Sabitri Bala Dey. Upon Ja­mini Kanta's death Sabitri obtained a probate and en­tered into possession. On the death of Sabitri Bala, defendant Nos. 1-4, sons of Sabitri's brother, came to possess the suit land. Plaintiffs in good faith be­lieving that they were the lawful heirs of Sabitri pur­chased from them, by two registered kabalas, the property described in the schedule to the plaint. Later on, it was found that defendant Nos. 1-4 were not the real owners of the said property but the real own­ers were defendant Nos. 5-9 who were the brother's sons of Sabitri Bala's husband. It is from them that the plaintiffs claim to have acquired title to the suit land initially by mortgage and then followed by pur­chase of the right of redemption. Plaintiffs alleged that defendant Nos. 1-4 dispossessed them from the property described in schedule 'kha' to the plaint.<br/><br/>3. The suit was contested by defendant Nos. 1 and 2. The learned Assistant Judge by judgment and decree dated 9.7.84 decreed the suit on contest against defendant Nos. 1 and 2 and ex pert against the rest. The contesting defendants filed an appeal Other Ap­peal No. 499/84, from the said judgment and decree. It was contended by them in the appeal that defendant Nos. 7-9 (respondents 6-8 herein) who were minors were not represented by any guardian in the trial court. On behalf of the plaintiffs it was submitted that no relief was prayed for against the said minor defendants and a Court guardian for the said minors having been appointed in the appellate court, the ir­regularity, if any, at the trial stage was cured. The learned Subordinate Judge, however, being of the view that non-compliance of the provision of Order 32, rule 3 C. P. C by the trial court was not curable, passed an order of remand on 8 July 1986 without entering into the merit of the case. This order of re­mand was challenged before the High Court Divi­sion, Chittagong Bench, in Civil Revision No. 318 of 1986. A Single Judge, by the impugned Judgment and order dated 2 February 1988, upheld the order of remand and discharged the rule in the said revision case.<br/><br/>4. Leave was granted to consider whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, the order of remand passed by the Subordinate Judge for curing the defect of non-appointment of guardian for the minor defendant Nos. 7-9 in the trial court was justified.<br/><br/>5. Mr. S. R. Pal, learned counsel for the appel­lants, firstly, contended that when a court guardian was in fact appointed to represent the minors in the appeal and the said court guardian represented the mi­nors, the order of remand as made was totally un­called for. The learned Counsel further submitted that the said minors having filed a sworn petition in the High Court Division stating that they had become major and they had no interest in the suit land, the learned Judge of the High Court Division ought to have set aside the order of remand which will unne­cessarily prolong the litigation to the great prejudice of the parties. No one appeared to oppose this ap­peal.<br/><br/>6. It is an admitted fact that defendants 7-9 (re­spondent 6-8 herein) were minors during the trial stage and neither their natural guardian appeared nor any court guardian was appointed on their behalf to represent their case, if any. The learned Judge of the High Court Division is right in holding that the pro­visions of rule 3 of Order 32 C. P. C. which provides for appointment of guardian by court for minor defendants is mandatory but it seems that it has been too broadly stated by the learned Judge that non-compliance with the aforesaid rule will render the whole proceeding of the suit including the passing of the decree a nullity even if it is found that such non-compliance has not virtually prejudiced the defence of the minor in any way. The cases referred to and relied upon show that the decrees in those cases were being challenged by the minors themselves on the ground that they were not properly represented at the passing of the said decrees and such decrees have been held to be void. There cannot be any dispute with this proposition. But the facts of the instant case, it will be presently seen, provide a typical ex­ample where the decree passed could not be said to be a nullity as a whole even though the court did not appoint a guardian for the minors at the trial. We have seen the plaint and found that relief had been prayed for only against defendants 1-4 who arc the principal defendants in the suit. Defendants 5-9 in­cluding the minors (nos. 7-9) were made proforma defendants and no relief was claimed against them. The decree passed in the suit could not, therefore, be said to be a nullity as a whole; but since the minor defendants were not properly represented they were neither bound nor any of their interest could be af­fected by the said decree.<br/><br/>7. Admittedly at the appellate stage a court guardian was appointed for the minor defendants and it has been stated by the appellants in their concise statement that the learned advocate, appointed guardi­an <em><img src="file:///C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image002.gif" style="height:16px; width:16px"/>ad litem</em> for the minor defendants, after corresponding with the natural guardian of the said mi­nors and perusal of the record, submitted his report on 9 December 1984 to the effect that the minor respondents had no subsisting interest and as such there was no point in contesting the appeal. That be­ing the position there could be no necessity for send­ing the case to the trial court for the purpose of ap­pointing a guardian for the minors there and thereupon to try the suit again. To do so, in my opinion, would amount to piling technicality upon unreason which will defeat rather than promote the cause of justice. Then again it is found that defen­dants 7-9 filed a sworn petition in the High Court Division stating that they had become major and that they had no interest in the original suit. It does not appear that the contesting defendants in the suit who were opposite parties in the revision before the High Court Division raised any objection to the said ap­plication. The learned Judge of the High Court Divi­sion, however, observed, with which we find it diffi­cult to agree, that "this court is not a proper forum to entertain this petition as the defendant Nos. 7-9 were unrepresented in the trial court and not in this court. If they have actually attained majority they may appear before the learned Trial Court and inform the trial court". Why could not the minors who had become major disown their own interest in the suit properly at any stage of the proceeding and that also before the High Court Division? Why must they be relegated to the trial court when the High Court Di­vision itself could record their submission and pass necessary order as was required. It must be said, with respect, that the learned Judge of the High Court Di­vision chose to follow the same technicality as did the learned Subordinate Judge overlooking the inter­est of justice in the matter and further that there was no necessity for rectifying the error in the trial court inasmuch as it was represented both at the appellate stage and in the revision that the minors had no sub­sisting interest in the suit property. It is clear that the order of remand would serve no purpose except to allow undergoing a formal ritual of the observance of rule 3 of Order 32 C. P. C. which will have no prac­tical bearing on the adjudication of the matter. We are, therefore, of the view that the order of remand made by the Subordinate Judge ought not to have been sustained by the High Court Division.<br/><br/>8. In the result, therefore, the appeal is al­lowed. The order of the learned Subordinate Judge, dated 8 July 1986 is set aside and the appeal, Other Appeal No. 499/84, is remanded to his court for dis­posal on merit in accordance with law and upon ser­vice of notice on the parties including respondents 6-8 (defendants 7-9) who are said to have attained ma­jority already. There will be no order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
