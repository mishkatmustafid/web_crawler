Short facts are that plaintiff instituted Title Suit No. 2 of 1987 in the Court of Assistant Judge, Kaliganj Upazilla, Gazipur for a declaration that the deed of exchange dated 08.11.1986 between defendant Nos. 1-3 on the one hand and defendant Nos. 4 and 5 on the other hand is not an exchange deed but an out and out sale deed stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that defen­dant no. 4-5 were the owners of 'ka' schedule property and defendant Nos. 1-3 were the own­ers of "Kha" schedule property. Defendant Nos. 1-3 transferred the 'Kha' schedule property to defendant Nos. 4-5 by way of out and out sale deed but to avoid the claim of pre-emption of the plaintiffs they created a deed of exchange instead of a deed of sale.<br/><br/>3. The defendant contested the suit by filing written statement denying all the material allegations made in the plaint and contended, <em>inter alia</em>, that defendant Nos. 4-5 exchanged their land with the land of the plaintiffs for conven­ience of mutual possession by a deed of exchange and the same was not a transaction of out and out sale.<br/><br/>4. The trial court on consideration of the materials on record decreed the suit. Being aggrieved the defendant preferred title appeal No. 56 of 1998 and the appellate court allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment and decree passed by the trial court. Being aggrieved the plaintiff moved the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 2948 of 1992 and by the impugned judgment the Rule was made absolute. Being aggrieved the defendant preferred the present civil petition for leave to appeal.<br/><br/>5. Leave was granted to consider the sub­mission that the court of appeal below having found that as per recitals in the disputed deed it is a deed of exchange and no oral evidence con­trary to the same was admissible and no consid­eration money  was paid. The High Court Division acted illegally in reversing the judg­ment and decree of the court of appeal below without considering the recitals in the deed and the failure of the plaintiff to prove payment of consideration money was not considered by the High Court Division and the further submission that the plaintiffs not being parties to the disput­ed deed and no case for pre-emption having been filed by them, they had no legal character to pray for declaration under section 42 of Specific Relief Act, 1877 and the High Court Division acted illegally in making the Rule absolute without considering the same.<br/><br/>6. We have heard Mr. Md. Nawab Ali, the learned Advocate-on-Record for the appellant and perused the judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers.<br/><br/>7. The High Court Division held  that learned Assistant Judge after due consideration of the materials on record and the circum­stances of the case decreed the suit of the plain­tiffs but the court of appeal reversed the find­ings of the trial court without adverting to the reasoning's given by the trial court and without considering the circumstances of the case and the circumstances leading to the execution of the kabala Ext. 3 by defendant Nos. 1 and 2 in favour of the sons and wives of defendant Nos. 3-5 in respect of schedule "Ka" land on the same date of execution of the deed of exchange Ext. 2.<br/><br/>8. The learned Advocate-on-Record for the appellant mainly argued that the payment of consideration money for Ext. 2 was not proved and the plaintiff of the suit being not party to the disputed deed and no case for pre-emption hav­ing been filed by them, they had no legal char­acter to pray for declaration under section 42 Specific Relief Act, 1877.<br/><br/>9. It is true that the High Court Division did not give any finding regarding the payment of consideration money in Ext. 2 and the High Court Division also did not take into considera­tion the vital fact that the plaintiffs are not par­ties to the disputed deed and they also the fact that they did not file any case for pre-emption against the deed of exchange Ext.2 and as such they had no legal character to pray for declara­tion under section 42 of Specific Relief Act, 1877 that the deed of exchange Ext.2 is not a deed of exchange but a deed of out and out sale.<br/><br/>10. We find substance in the submissions of the learned Advocate-on-Record for the appellant that from the recitals of Ext. 2 it is clear that the same is a deed of exchange and no satisfac­tory oral evidence was adduced by the plaintiffs to rebut the recitals of the written instrument.<br/>In the circumstances, we are of the view that the High Court Division was not justified in making the Rule absolute and setting aside the judgment of the court of appeal below.<br/>The appeal is, accordingly, allowed without any order as to cost.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
