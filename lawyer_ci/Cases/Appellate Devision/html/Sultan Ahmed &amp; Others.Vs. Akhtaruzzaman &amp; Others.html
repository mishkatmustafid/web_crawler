The question raised is whether the order of pre-emption against them, as finally upheld by the High Court Division in revision, is sustainable in law in view of the fact that a co-sharer in one of the plots of the holding transferred was not impleaded in the pre­emption proceeding.<br/><br/>2. This arises from Miscellaneous Case No.29 of 1976 of the Second Court of Munsif, Noakhali, which was filed by the respondents under section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act. They claimed pre-emption of a land transferred by a kabala dated 18 November 1975, by their co-sharer, Oppo­site Party No. 4 in the said case to these appellants, strangers, without giving them any notice. The trial Court by an order dated 22 February 1980 allowed the pre-emption case; but on appeal, Miscellaneous Appeal No. 70 of 1980, the learned Subordinate Judge set aside the order and dismissed the pre­emption case. This order was challenged in revi­sion—Civil Revision No. 277 of 1984—and a learned Single Judge of the High Court Division, by the impugned Order dated 24 March 1986, reversed the order of the Appellate Court and restored that of the trial Court.<br/><br/>3. The application for pre-emption was op­posed, among other things, on the ground that Nurul Islam, father of the purchasers was a co-sharer by in­heritance in Plot No. 2085 of the Khatian constitut­ing the "holding" transferred and secondly, Nurul Is­lam was himself the actual purchaser under the kabala in question in the benami of his sons, the pre-emptees; but Nurul Islam was not made a party to the application for pre-emption, and as such the application for pre-emption was liable to be dis­missed. Evidence was led to show that Nurul Islam's homestead stands in Plot No. 2085, and he himself deposed in the case stating that he had purchased the land under pre-emption in the benami of his sons—a fact admitted by P.W.1—one of the Pre-emptors, in cross-examination saying that they had come to know of the benami purchase before the filing of the application for pre-emption.<br/><br/>4. The learned Munsif, however, took the view that this defect of party was not fatal to the pre­-emption case and observed that "the Hon'ble High Court in a recent ruling took this view", without, however, referring to any particular case in which this alleged view was taken by the High Court Divi­sion. The learned subordinate Judge took the oppo­site view and found that the defect of party, that is omission to implead a co-sharer by inheritance, namely Nurul Islam, was fatal for the pre-emption case. The learned Single Judge of the High Court Di­vision did not find that Nurul Islam was a co-sharer taking the view that "the question of benami transac­tion" under the kabala in question could not be raised in a summary proceeding for pre-emption. But as to whether Nurul Islam was a co-sharer by inheritance in the holding transferred, the learned Single Judge omitted to consider this point.<br/><br/>5. Mr. M.H. Khondkar, learned Counsel for the appellants, was prompt to pinpoint this omission and contended that the application for pre-emption was liable to dismissal for defect of parties. Mr. Awlad Hossain, learned Counsel for the respondents, in his attempt to defend the order of the learned Single Judge, has submitted that the learned Single Judge in fact concurred in the finding of the trial Court that Nurul Islam was not a co-sharer, when the trial Court's judgment was restored. Even if for the sake of argument it is taken that the trial Court's finding was accepted by implication, it is to be seen whether the finding of the trial Court on this point in cor­rect.<br/><br/>6. As already indicated above, Nurul Islam is a co-sharer in Plot No. 2085, which is included in the Khatian constituting the holding transferred. The learned Munsifs view on this point is quoted below:<br/>"But the C.Ps. contend that their father Nu­rul Islam is the owner of the disputed plot No. 2085 by inheritance. But co-ownership of a disputed plot without being a co-sharer in the Khatian does not confer any right to the co-owner of the plot to resist the pre-emption."<br/>This view clearly shows that the learned Munsif misconceived as to what is meant by the expression "co-sharer in the holding". When Nurul Islam was a co-sharer in one of the plots of the Khatian he was certainly a co-sharer in the holding. But failure of the Pre-emptors to implead him in the application for pre-emption is a serious defect of party since impleading of a co-sharer, whether by inheritance or by purchase, is a mandatory provision of s.96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act. The application for pre-emption is, therefore, liable to be dismissed, as has been rightly held by the Appellate Court. This omission was pointed out at the earliest point of time but the omission was not supplied. In the circumstances, the impugned order of the High Court Division resorting the trial Court's order allowing pre-emption is not sustainable in law.<br/><br/>7. In the result, the appeal is allowed. The or­der for pre-emption is set aside and the miscellane­ous case is dismissed.<br/>No order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
