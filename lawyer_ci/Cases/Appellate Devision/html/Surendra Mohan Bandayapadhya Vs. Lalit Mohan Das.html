The predecessor of the petitioners filed Title Suit No.66 of 1967 in the Court of Additional Munsif, Madaripur, for declaration of his hostile title in the suit land and for further declaration that the rent roll as prepared in respect of the suit land has been wrongly prepared and also prayed for confirmation of posses­sion. The plaintiff Nos.1 and 2 claimed title by way of inheritance and the plain­tiff Nos.3 and 4 claimed title on the basis of auction sale in a revenue case and that the defendant Nos.3 and 4 some time after partition of India left East Pakistan for West Bengal surrendering the suit tenancy against redemption of arrear rent, in favour of the plaintiff Nos.1 and 2 in the month of Agrahayan 1350 B.S. and they never came back to this country and that the plaintiff Nos.1 and 2 took khas possession of the land and have been enjoying usufructs there­from. The contesting defendants manu­factured and forged an antedated amal­nama in respect of the suit land showing the defendant Nos. 3 and 4 as grantor and the defendant No.1 as recipient and by false personification managed to file Rent Suit No.1250 of 1955 in the name of the defendant Nos. 3 and 4 and obtained a sole decree by practicing fraud upon the Court and taking advan­tage of the said decree, the defendant filed a Criminal Case against the plain­tiff in the Court of S.D.O. Madaripur under Section 379 of the Penal Code alleging theft and taking away of crops from the suit land by the plaintiff, wherein the plaintiff was convicted and punished but on appeal was acquitted and that the appellate Court on scrutiny of the documents doubted the amalnama and observed that the defendant Nos.3 and 4 were not residing in the country after 1354 B.S. and thus found the amalnama of 1358 B.S., allegedly executed by defendant Nos. 3 and 4, to be a forged document.<br/><br/>3. The plaintiff filed Title Suit No.66 of 1967 for declaration of title and confir­mation of possession in the suit land. The suit was decreed against the defen­dant Nos.1 and 2 on contest and <em>ex parte</em> against the rest. The trial Court found title and possession of the plaintiff in the suit land observing that the plaintiff became tenant under the Government by operation of law after acquisition of the rent receiving interest. The trial Court disbelieved the witnesses of the defen­dants since they made contradictory statements as to possession of the suit land and found the witnesses adduced by the plaintiff to corroborate the story of possession of the plaintiff in the suit land. The defendants claim of posses­sion on the basis of settlement was dis­believed as the documents produced in support of the settlement i.e. the Amalnama and the rent receipts were found to be forged documents (Exhibits-B. B-1) and that the tenancy in respect of the suit land was surrendered in favour of the plaintiff landlord by the defendant Nos.3 and 4 before their leaving Pakistan and thus the plaintiffs were found in khas possession of the suit land and it was also found that from the deposition of the D.W. that the defendant Nos.3-4 left for West Bengal and before their departure they surrendered the ten­ancy in favour of the plaintiff landlords in the month of Agrahayan, 1350 B.S., which correspondence to 1943 A.D. The trial Court framed 5 issues in arriving at its decision and found that the suit was not barred by limitation and the suit was not hit by the Ordinance 1 of 1964 and that the plaintiff proved their right, title, interest, and possession in the suit land and the plaintiff succeeded to prove title and possession in the suit land and thus entitled to get a decree as prayed for. Being aggrieved the defendant Nos.1 and 2 preferred Title Appeal No. 256 of 1968 in the Court of District Judge, Faridpur, which was heard and disposed of by the learned Subordinate Judge, Faridpur, by judgment and decree dated 26.05.1969 allowing the appeal holding, amongst others, that the suit was hope­lessly time barred and the defendants were in possession of the suit land since Falgoon 1358 B.S. and that the learned Munsif acted illegally in discarding the depositions of D.Ws.2-6 and 8 summar­ily on the plea of some discrepancies found in the depositions of defendant Nos.1 and 7, and the appellate Court fur­ther held that the depositions of P.Ws.2-6 in proving the plaintiffs possession of the suit land, though appear to be of independent witnesses, but their evi­dence cannot get preference to those of D.Ws. since supported by documentary evidence, marked Exhibit-B series and F, and thereby the appellate Court believed the possession of the defendant in the suit land. The appellate Court also believed the amalnama and thereby relying on the said amalnama found the title of the defendant in the suit land.<br/><br/>4. The High Court Division, being moved by the plaintiff in Second Appeal No.435 of 1971, on consideration of the materials on record and on detailed dis­cussion on the depositions of plaintiffs witnesses dismissed the appeal observ­ing that the definite case of the plaintiff was that the defendant Nos.3 and 4 surrendered the suit land in favour of the plaintiffs on Agrahayan 1350 B.S. and the P.Ws.2-4 have clearly supported the surrender of the suit land by the defen­dant Nos.3 and 4 in favour of the plain­tiff in the year 1350 B.S. and that it has been stated that the defendant Nos.3-4 left Pakistan soon after independence. The year 1350 B.S. correspondence to 1944 A.D. whereas Pakistan got inde­pendence in 1947. The plaintiffs' case of possession and title on the basis of such surrender has no standing in the eye of law. The learned Advocate appearing for the leave petitioner failed to explain the story of surrender of the suit land in favour of the plaintiff by the defendant Nos.3 and 4 in the year 1350 B.S. as against the statement that the defendant Nos.3 and 4 left this country soon after creation of Pakistan and never returned back and thus we do not find any point to interfere with the decision of the High Court Division inasmuch as the said judgment and decree appears to have been passed on proper discussion made and consideration on the facts and evi­dences on record.<br/>Accordingly, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div></div></div>
