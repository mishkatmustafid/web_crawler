The relevant facts are that the plaintiff appellants got a contested decree of permanent injunction on 30.8.90 in Title Suit No. 380 of 1987, renumbered as Title suit No. 424 of 1984 of the Court of the Assistant Judge, the then Baliakandi Upazila, Rajbari, against defendant Nos. 1-4 respondents restraining them from giving on lease the suit land to any body and disturbing the plaintiffs' possession therein and also of a declaration that the proceeding taken in V.P. Case No. XII-1877 72-73 is illegal, void and not binding upon the plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs shall get khas possession in "kha" schedule property evicting defendant No. 4 (ka) there from. The aggrieved defendant respon­dent Nos. 1-4 then preferred Title Appeal No. 91 of 1990 in the Court of District Judge, Rajbari against the said decree. The appeal was dismissed for default on 20.11.91. Those defendants filed an application under order XLI Rule 19 of the Code of Civil Procedure, Misc. Case No. 1 of 1992, for re-admission of the appeal. The learned District Judge by an order dated 24.5.92 dismissed the said Misc. Case holding, <em>inter alia</em>, that the case was barred by 19 days and that the defendant appellants could not explain the delay, specially for the period from 1.1.92 to 8.1.92, and that they also failed to show sufficient cause preventing them from appearing in the appeal when it was called on for hearing. Being aggrieved defendant No. 4(ka) - petitioner respondent No. 1 moved the High Court Division in revision, and obtained a Rule in Civil Revision No. 2199 of 1992, (although an appeal should have been preferred against such order under order XLIII Rule I of CPC. A learned Single Judge of the High Court Division by the impugned judgment and order made the Rule absolute and after setting aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the learned District Judge allowed the appli­cation filed by the defendant respondents under order XLI Rule 19 C.P.C, holding <em>inter alia</em>, that the learned District Judge did not take into con­sideration the material evidence that during the period from 18.11.91 to 6.12.91 the appellant, Abdul Jalil, who used to make tadbir for self and on behalf of the other appellants in the appeal, had been suffering from typhoid and as such he failed to take necessary steps in the matter and that on 1.1.92 he came to know about the order of dismissal of the appeal from the Mohurar of the learned Advocate and that thereafter the case was filed. The learned judge held that non consideration of those important piece of evidence materially affected the merit of the case and occasioned a failure of justice.<br/><br/>3. Leave was granted to consider whether the learned Judge of the High Court Division set aside the order of the learned District Judge without fully comprehending the reasons given by him (District Judge) for rejecting the appli­cation of the defendant appellants.<br/><br/>4. Mr. M. M. Hyder Ali, learned Advocate appearing for the appellant submits that the defendant respondents application under order XLI Rule 19 CPC for re-admission of appeal was barred by 19 days, having been filed after 49 days of the passing of the order of dismissal of the appeal. An application under section 5 of the Limitation Act for condonation of delay was filed therewith. But the learned District Judge on consideration of the oral evidence of P.W. I Abdul Jalil and other materials on record refused to condone the delay upon assigning reasons that the defendant appellant petitioner could not explain the delay and that they also failed to show sufficient cause which has pre­vented them from appearing when the appeal was called on for hearing. The learned District Judge dismissed the Misc. Case both on the ground of limitation as well as on merit upon assigning cogent reasons on facts, but the learned Judge of the High Court Division in exercise of his revisional authority has commit­ted an error of law in setting aside the impugned judgment and order without reversing the find­ings arrived at by the learned District Judge.<br/><br/>5. It appears that the learned District Judge upon taking note of the facts stated in the appli­cation for condonation of delay, filed under sec­tion 5 of the limitation Act, 1908 and the depo­sition of P.W.I the present Respondent No. I Abudl Jalil, arrived at findings that the Misc. Case was barred by 19 days and that the peti­tioners of that case could not satisfactorily explain each days delay, specially for the period from 1.1.92 to 8.1.92 and accordingly held that the Misc. Case was barred by limitation. It fur­ther appears that the learned District Judge on consideration of the evidence on record also arrived at findings that defendant Nos. 1,2 and 4 <em>viz</em> the Government of Bangladesh, the ADC (Revenue), Rajbari and the Supt. of vested and non resident property Rajbari preferred the appeal in question through the Government pleader, Rajbari, Mr. Abdul Wajed Biswas and that no cause was shown on their behalf for the failure of the Government pleader to appear when the appeal was called on for hearing and that it was also not explained how a private individual became a tadbirkar for the Government in the appeal in question. Upon such finding of facts the learned District Judge held that the appellant petitioners before him could also not prove that they had been prevent­ed by sufficient cause from appearing when the appeal was called on for hearing. Thus it appears that the learned District Judge dismissed the Misc. Case not only on limitation but also on merit.<br/><br/>6. The learned Judge of the High Court Division in the impugned judgment did not at all touch upon the question of limitation, not to speak of reversing the finding in that regard arrived at by the learned District Judge, on con­sideration of facts, that the Misc. Case in ques­tion was barred by 19 days. Thus the impugned judgment of the High Court Division is patent­ly not a proper judgment of reversal.<br/><br/>7. The learned District Judge appears to have taken due notice of all the revenant facts stated and grounds taken in the petition, filed under Order 41 Rule 19 CPC in dismissing the Misc. Case Thus it appears that the learned Judge of the High Court Division is not justified in holding that due to non consideration of the vital and material facts by the learned District Judge there has been an occasion of failure of justice, which warrants interference in revision.<br/><br/>8. Accordingly we find substance in this appeal. It is allowed without any order as to cost. The impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division is set aside and the Judgment and order passed by the learned dis­trict Judge in the Misc. Case in question is restored.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
