Whether or not the said plot No.65 is identical with Annexure-K and Annexure-A is a question of fact and it could be resolved in a regular title suit by making relay­ment by an Advocate Commissioner and other support evidence on record and the same could not be the subject matter of writ petition.

The facts involved in the case, in short, are that the property in C.S. Plot No.65 is a Debutter property created by Roy Bahadur Karuna Das Bose by a reg­istered deed of Arpannama dated 01.05.1914 wherein the ancestors of the petitioner have given details regarding the management of the property in deity by Managing Shebayet. After transfer of C.S. Plot No.65 to the deity Sree Sree Laxmi Narayan, the heirs of Roy Bahadur Karuna Das Bose have been managing the property of the deity as <em>Shebayets</em> and scheme for the proper management of the property was declared by decree passed by Subordinate Judge, 1st Court, Dhaka in Title Suit No.56 of 1944 and since then the said property is being run by the <em>Shebayets.</em> The C.S. record was rightly prepared and published in the name of Roy Bahadur Karuna Das Bose on behalf of the deity Sree Sree Laxmi Narayan Jew. The Managing <em>Shebayet</em> started possessing the land of C.S. Plot Nos.94 and 95 by erecting some sheds and <em>kuccha</em> rooms upon case plot No.65 and letting out the same. Thereafter, the Managing <em>Shebayet</em> Ranendra Nath Bose went to India permanently and according to the terms of Arpannama the father of the petitioner suit Kumar Bose was appointed Managing <em>Shebayet </em>on behalf of Bigraha and he was looking after the said Debutter property properly while the said Mamnoor Rashid was monthly tenant under the said Debutter property he transferred his land in C.S. plot Nos.94 and 95 in 1963 to one Faikuzzaman and handed over the pos­session. Thereafter, the said Mamnoor Rashid handed over the possession of case land i.e. C.S. plot No.65 to the Managing <em>Shebayet</em>. Thereafter in 1964 the said Faikuzzaman intended to take on rent the same as monthly tenant and the Managing Shebayet let out said Debutter property to him as monthly tenant and he has been paying rent to the Managing <em>Shebayet</em> of the said Debutter property. The tenant Faikuzzaman died in 1978 and the respondent No.7 Fazle Elahi Sharfuzzaman started possessing the case land as monthly tenant under the petitioner and started paying rent at the rate of TK.2000.00 per month to the petitioner as accepting him as Managing <em>Shebayet</em> of the said<em> Debutter</em> property and in 1985 the monthly rent was increased from TK.2000.00 to 5000.00 for the cause of increasing the cost of maintenance of the Bigraha but on request the petitioner's rent was being realizing at the rate of TK.2000.00 per month till 2005 and from 2005 respondent No.7 did not pay any rent. The respondent No.7 assured to pay the unpaid rent but did not pay and trying to grab the property of the petitioner. The respondent No.7 has no right and title in the case land i.e. in C.S. Plot No.65 but in 2007 he started construction in C.S. Plot No.65 and on 08.08.2007 the peti­tioner requested the respondent No.7 to stop the illegal construction in the case plot No.65 and to vacate the case land. The respondent No.7 denied the title of the petitioner and disclosed that RAJUK approved the plan for construc­tion of multistoried commercial cum-residential building came to know from RAJUK that the respondent No.7 along with other 8 persons obtained approval of plan and clearance from RAJUK for construction of high rise building by submitting deed of other plots and then the petitioner as Managing <em>Shebayet</em> of the said Debutter property requested the local respectable persons to stop the ille­gal construction of the respondent No.7 in the land of the said Debutter property and the local people requested to stop the construction in the case land but the respondent No.7 did not stop the con­struction in the case land as yet. The respondent No.7 and his brothers have no right, title and possession in C.S. Plot Nos.94 and 95. The superior predeces­sor of Bhuban Mohan Ghose purchased the land measuring 1.05 acres of land by a sale deed being No.22615 dated 04.07.1928 from one Elahi Box Driver and the said vendor Bhuban Mohan Ghose as plaintiff filed a suit being Title Suit No.1537 of 1929 against the vendor Elahi Box Driver and 3 others in the 3rd Court of <em>Munsif,</em> Dhaka praying for dec­laration of title and recovery of <em>khas</em> possession of the suit land the plaintiffs case was that the defendants sold to him on 19th <em>Ashar,</em> 1335 B.S. C.S. Plot No.94 and part of plot No.95 and showed him the land in the locality plaintiff got the western portion of the C.S. Plot No.94 in his possession but the defendants did not deliver possession in the western portion of the said plot and dispossessed the plaintiff from the plot No.94.<br/><br/>3. The respondent No.7 contested the Rule submitted affidavit-in-opposition denying the material statement contend­ing, <em>inter alia,</em> that the land measuring 1.11 acres in plot No.65 appertaining to C.S. <em>Khatian</em> No.6947 of mouza Shahar Dhaka under Police Station Kotwali belonged to Karuna Das Bahadur trans­ferred 8 <em>bighas</em> of land including C.S. Plot No.65 to one Sheikh Shefatullah. Sheikh Shefatullah transferred the same in Elahi Box Driver by dint of registered sale deed on 3rd Magh, 1326 B.S. Elahi Box Driver owned and possessed that land and subsequently on 04.07.1928 transferred 3(three) pakhis of land with specific boundary of Bhuban Mohan Ghose vide registered deed No.2615. Bhuban Mohan Ghose as plaintiff filed Title Suit No.1537 of 1929 against Elahi Box and others in the 3rd Court of <em>Munsif</em>, Dhaka for declaration of title and recovery of <em>'Kha</em>' possession so far it relates to C.S. Plot No.94. In that suit Elahi Box filed written statement con­testing the suit land eventually the suit was dismissed by the trial Court on 23.03.1931 but the findings of posses­sion was in favour of the plaintiff as regards to C.S. Plot No.65.<br/><br/>4. Mr. Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan, learned Counsel, appearing for the petitioners submitted that the C.S. Plot No.65 is the debuttor property and the said property by Karuna Das Bose by a registered arpannama dated 01.05.1914 in favour of Sree Sree Laxmi Narayan Jew Tagore and the C.S.<em> Khatian</em> No.6947 was rightly prepared in the name of the said Sree Sree Laxmi Narayan Jew Tagore being represented by Shebayet Karuna Das Bose Bahadur and the writ-respondent No.7's predecessors are the monthly ten­ants under Shebayet of the said debuttor property and the scheme of the proper management of the debuttor property was declared by judgment and decree passed by Subordinate Judge, 1st Court, Dhaka in Title Suit No.56 of 1944 and since then the said debuttor property is being run by the Shebayets and the said debuttor property has never by trans­ferred; that the C.S. Plot No.65 is the debuttor property and the respondent Rajuk has illegally approved the plan in favour of the writ-respondent No.7 for construction of 20 storied building in C.S. Plot No.65 which is debuttor prop­erty and writ-respondent No.7 obtained some certificates from various departments only mentioning 37/2 Purana Paltan and with respect to C.S. Plot No.65 but writ-respondent No.7 obtained plan from RAJUK to construct 16 storied building in C.S. Plot No.94 and 95(part) and 65 by suppression of facts and when he started construction in C.S. Plot No.65 then it was brought to the knowledge of RAJUK and RAJUK issued a notice upon the writ-respondent No.7 to show cause as to whey the approved plan should not be cancelled and stopped the construction work and the writ-respondent No.7 challenging the said notice filed writ petition No.6875 of 20078 and in the said writ petition the High Court Division found that the C.S. Plot No.65 is the debuttor property and finally discharged the Rule but thereafter, RAJUK illegally allowed writ-respondent No.7 to make construc­tion on C.S. Plot No.65 which is a debuttor property. The learned Counsel further submitted that the predecessors of writ-respondent No.7 and also respondent No.7 were the monthly tenants under Shebayet of the said debuttor property and respondent No.7 and his brothers in collusion with the dishonest employees of settlement department got S.A. record in their name but in respect of C.S. Plot No.65 they have no deed by which they can claim the title of the said plot and in the absence of title deed in respect of C.S. Plot No.65 RAJUK can not allow respondent No.7 to make con­struction on the said plot; that the sub­ject matter of the writ petition and Title Suit No.1633 of 2008 are not the same or similar as because Title Suit No.1633 of 2008 filed by the petitioner as plain­tiff for declaration of title and recovery of <em>khas</em> possession and the writ petition was filed challenging the action of RAJUK whereby RAJUK approved the plan in favour of respondent No.7 and his brother to construct 16 storied commercial-cum-residential building in C.S. Plot No.65 which is debuttor prop­erty. The learned Counsel also submit­ted that there is not on record to show that the beel land is the land of Annexure-A or Annexure-K unless a relayment is made and report is obtained showing the land of C.S. Plot No.65 is identical with land of schedule 3 of the Annexure-A and Annexure-K it is diffi­cult on the part of the Court sitting in writ jurisdiction to hold that the land of Plot No.65 of <em>mouza</em> Shahar Dhaka attracts the lands of schedule 'C of Annexure-A. It appears that according to C.S. Plot No.65 is a debuttor proper­ty to which writ-respondent No.7 did not claim as title by any title deed and hence further enquiry as opined by the High Court Division is unnecessary for the purpose of considering the legality of the actions of RAJUK and therefore, the judgment of the High Court Division is not sustainable in law.<br/><br/>5. It appears that there is no mention of plot number either in Annxure-A or in Annexure-K. There is no other docu­ment available on record to show that the property as described in schedule of the Annexure-A and Annexure-K to the writ petition and supplementary affi­davit filed by the petitioner are identical with the land of C.S. Plot No.65<em>, mouza</em> Shahar Dhaka. It further appears that the plot No.65 has been recorded as<em> 'beel'</em>. There is nothing on record to show that the said <em>beel</em> land is the land of Annexure-A or Annexure-K. Unless a relayment is made and a report is obtained showing the land of C.S. Plot No.65 is identical with the land of schedule-3 of the Annexure-A and schedule-5 of the Annexure-K it is diffi­cult on the part of this Court, sitting in writ jurisdiction to hold that the land of plot No.65 of <em>mouza </em>Shahar Dhaka attracts the lands of schedule-C of Annexure-A and Annexure-K. Whether or not the said plot No.65 is identical with Annexure-K and Annexure-A is a question of fact and it could be resolved in a regular title suit by making relay­ment by an Advocate Commissioner and other support evidence on record and the same could not be the subject matter of writ petition. Admittedly the petitioners being out of possession has instituted the suit for declaration of title and recovery of<em> khas</em> possession. It appears that S.A. record, R.S. record and mutat­ed Khatian stood prepared in the name of the represented No.7 and others and their predecessors. Admittedly the respondents are in possession by paying rent and taxes since 1965, it is difficult to hold that the approval made by the respondent Nos.3 and 5 were without having any law authority.<br/><br/>6. In view of the above, we find no sub­stance in the submissions of the learned Counsel for the petitioner.<br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
