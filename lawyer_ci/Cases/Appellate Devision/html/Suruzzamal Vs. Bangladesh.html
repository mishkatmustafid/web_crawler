He is seeking leave to appeal from an order of the High Court Division dated 25 November 1991, in Civil Rule No. 115(F) of 1990, condoning &amp; respondent‑plaintiff s delay of 576 days in filing an appeal from the trial Court's Judgment and decree, passed in Tide Suit No. 69 of 1981.<br/><br/>2. This suit was tried analogously with Title Suit No. 339 of 1981. Both the suits related to a property which was claimed by respondent, Govern­ment of Bangladesh, as an abandoned property a claim denied by the petitioner who claimed title therein. TS No. 69 of 1981 was filed by respondent for a declaration that the property is an abandoned property; and TS No. 339 of 1981 was filed by the petitioner for a declaration of title and recovery of possession. The trial Court, namely Subordinate Judge, 3rd Court, Dhaka by a common Judgment dated 31 August 1988, dismissed the government­respondent's suit and decreed the petitioner's suit. In TS No, 339 of 198 1, respondent filed an appeal  ­FA No. 181 of 1990 - after a delay of 535 days. The delay was condoned by the High Court Division by an order dated 28 August 1990 in Civil Rule No. 83(F) of 1990. Petitioner did not challenge this condonation. Respondent then filed an appeal‑FAT No. 206 of 1990‑in TS No. 169 of 1981 also, after a delay of 576 days, and on their application under section 5, Limitation Act, the High Court Division, by the impugned order, condoned the delay subject to payment of Taka 3,500.00 as cost to this Petitioner by the Government.<br/><br/>3. Mr. TH Khan, learned Counsel for the petitioner, has seriously assailed the condonation of this inordinate delay of about two years. He has contended that the delay has not been explained by the respondent and that the ground stated in their application under section 5, Limitation Act clearly shows that the delay was caused by willful neglect and serious laches on the part of the Government's officers, particularly the law‑officers involved in this matter. Learned Counsel has also criticised the view taken by the learned Judges of the High Court Division that in appropriate cases the Government, as a litigant, might be treated on a different footing <em>vis-a-vis</em> a private litigant; he has pointed out that an observation of this Court in the case of <strong><em>Bangladesh Vs. Jaferuddin, 1986 BLD (AD) 180</em></strong> has been misappreciated by the learned Judges.<br/><br/>4. Respondent's application for condonation says that the proposal for preferring the appeal was received by the Office of the Deputy Solicitor on 18.1.90 (about 11/2, year after delivery of the Judgment) and since then the file moved from place to place, from officer to officer and from section to section and then ultimately the appeal was made ready on 3.2.90 and it was filed in the court on 3.4.90, that is, after 576 days' delay. Whatever may be the official procedure for preparation and filing of an appeal by the Government, the explanation for the delay in this case is not satisfactory and it lends support to the contention of the learned Counsel that the delay was due to laches of the respondent's officers, particularly law officers. It is strange that instead of taking disciplinary action against their officers at fault, the respondent raised one ground after another during the hearing of the condonation matter which were not taken in the application for condonation itself. One such ground is, that the required fund for payment of court‑fee was not available at the relevant time. Another ground, which was in fact given serious consideration by the High Court Division, is that the respondent's earlier application for certified copy of the trial Court's Judgment was erroneously dismissed on a 11 suspicious endorsement" therein to the effect that "certified copy is not necessary." This refers to the usual practice of filing an appeal with an ordinary copy of photo copy of a Judgment where another appeal from the common Judgment had already been filed with its certified copy. When a certified copy had been filed in the other appeal (FA 181 of 1990), the respondent could have filed this appeal (FAT 206 of 1990) with an ordinary copy praying for exemption of the certified copy.<br/><br/>5. We however rind it difficult to grant leave in this case for the ultimate purpose of setting aside the condonation of the delay. Subject matter of both the appeals being same, they should be heard on merit. The other appeal is ready for hearing; if this appeal is dismissed on ground of limitation, conflicting decision is likely in the other appeal when decided on merit. The impugned condonation of the delay should not therefore be interfered with.<br/><br/>6. The learned counsel has referred to some unfair practices allegedly adopted by the respondent's officers in connection with the property in question. This property, as claimed by the petitioner, belonged to a Bangladeshi, named Dr. Shamim who had taken loan from Rupali Bank, previously Muslim Commercial Bank, in June 1970 but could not repay the loan. Thereupon the bank filed a Money Suit, obtained a decree and put it into execution in Money Execution Case No. 22 of 1972. The property was then attached and advertisement was published for its sale in auction. At this stage, the respondent filed Misc. Case No. 174 of 1974 under Order XXI, rule 58 CPC for releasing the property from attachment but their case was dismissed. Petitioner then purchased the property in Court Sale and was given symbolical possession on 17.3.79. Respondent disregarded this Court-sale and illegally allotted the property to Radio Bangladesh treating it as an abandoned property, although it was not included in the list of Abandoned Properties, officially published as late as 1986. After disposal of the two suits, the petitioner put the decree he got in TS No. 339 of 1981 into execution and got delivery of actual possession on 7.2.90 at 12‑30 PM. A contingent of police force headed by the OC of Dhanmondi PS accompanied the Court's officials who had delivered the possession to the petitioner. But at about 10‑00 PM of the same day, at the instance of the Director General, Radio Bangladesh (Defendant No. 2) the same contingent of police arrested his men and dispossessed him from the property. Not only that, a criminal case of trespass was started against his men‑Dhanmondi PS Case No. 19(2) of 1990. Against this case, the petitioner filed an application before the High Court Division for quashing the proceeding which is awaiting the final result of the Title Suits. In these circumstances, the learned Counsel for the petitioner has contended, the petitioner's agony and harassment will continue if the condonation of the delay is not reversed, Lastly, the learned Counsel has submitted that in case both the appeals are to be heard on merit, they should be heard by some other Bench as the Bench where they are pending is very busy with heavy files and will not be in a position to dispose of them expeditiously.<br/><br/>7. We have considered this submission. We direct that both the appeals be disposed of very expeditiously and in case this Bench is u take up these appeals soon, the Bench will take Ste for their disposal by some other Bench.<br/>The petition is dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
