Afzal J.—</strong> In this appeal by leave, the question for consideration is whether the plain­tiff-appellant was non-suited upon a correct view of section 86 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) as substituted by the Bangladesh State Acquisition and Tenancy (Fourth Amendment) Order, 1972 (President's Order No. 135 of 1972.)<br/><br/>2. The plaintiff filed Title Suit No. 51 of 1970 in the First Court of Subordinate Judge, Barisal for a declaration of his title to the suit land measuring 12.40 acres. His case is that the suit land appertain­ing to mouza Aicha belonged to Shayestabad Wakf Estate. Since 1335 B.S. the suit land began to sub­merge and it submerged completely in 1338 B.S. in river Arial Kha. The suit land, however, re-appeared in 1352 B.S. and on 3rd Baisakh 1354 Plaintiff look Karsha settlement of the same by executing a Kabu­liyat Ext.1 which was registered. The plaintiff pos­sessed the suit land, paid rent but it again went under water in 1362-63 B.S. only to reappear again in 1374 B.S. since when the plaintiff claims to be in possession. The Suit land was, however, recorded in S.A. Khatian in the name of the Government and rent was not accepted from the plaintiff whereupon the suit was filed.<br/><br/>3. The government, defendant-respondent No.1, contested the suit by denying the plaintiffs case and raising the plea, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit land was part of the river Arial Kha since 1335 B.S. and it partly reformed after long 39 years in 1374 B.S. and that the suit was barred under section 86 of the Act.<br/><br/>4. The learned Subordinate Judge accepting the plaintiffs' case decreed that suit by judgment dated 7.8.73. On appeal by the Government, the learned Additional District Judge, Bakerganj set aside the de­cree by his Judgment dated 21.4.75. It was observed in the judgment that the suit was decided without ref­erence to P.O. 135 of 1972 by which sec.86 of the Act was substituted and the plaintiffs title, if any, had been extinguished and the suit land vested in the Government by reason of clauses (2) and (3) of sec.86. This view has been upheld in the Second Ap­peal taken by the plaintiff by a Single Judge of the High Court Division, Barisal by the impugned Judg­ment and decree dated 1st December, 1983.<br/><br/>5. To understand the point at issue it will be necessary to reproduce the relevant clauses of sec. 86 of the Act as substituted by P.O. 135 of 1972 made on 3rd November, 1972.<br/>86. (1)......................................................................................................................<br/>(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, the right, title and interest of the tenant or his successors-in-interest shall be extinguished in such lands or portion thereof, whether the loss of such lands or portion by diluvion took or takes place before or after the commencement of the State Acquisition and Tenancy (Fourth Amend­ment) Order, 1972.<br/>(3) All lands, so lost by diluvion under sub-section (2), which re-appeared before the date of commencement of the said Order, but in respect of which the right of the tenant, whose land was so lost, or his successors-in-interest to re­possession was not finally recognised or declared by a competent authority or Court under any law for the time being in force and also all lands, so lost by diluvion under the said sub­section, which may re-appear on or after the said date, shall vest absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances and shall be at its disposal.<br/>It is the plaintiffs own case that the second dilu­vion of the suit land look place in 1362-63 B.S. and it reappeared in 1374 B.S. It is clear that clauses (2) and (3) as above get immediately attracted because the diluvion took place before the commencement of P.O. 135 of 1972 and the lands also reappeared before the commencement of the said Order. Under clause (2) the right, title and interest of the tenant get extinguished as soon as his land is diluviated. Clause (3) provides that all such lands which re-appeared be­fore the commencement of P.O. 135 of 1972 shall vest absolutely in the Government free from all en­cumbrances and shall be at its disposal except those in respect of which the right of the tenant to re­possession was finally recognised or declared by a competent authority or Court, obviously after re­appearance. In the present case; the clear finding is that the plaintiffs' right was never recognised as re­quired under clause (3) nor any argument is made that the said finding is wrong. Thus it must be said that the view taken by the Additional District Judge and upheld by the High Court Division is correct.<br/><br/>6. Dr. Kamal Hossain, learned counsel for the appellant, finding it difficult to get over the decision submitted, perhaps as a last resort, relying on the case of <em><strong>A. Mannan Vs. Kulada Ranjan 31 DLR(AD) 195</strong></em> that since clauses (2) and (3) have been held to be retrospective only from the date of coming into force of Part V of the Act, it is necessary for the Government to produce the notification in that be­half showing that part V came into force in the area to which the suit land appertains before the same had re-appeared in 1374 B.S. = 1967. This is not a point on which the plaintiff can hang, on for long. It ap­pears from the paper book that the disputed Khatians Ext. 4 and-4(a) - R.S. and S.A. Khatian No.l of Mouja Aicha - relate to P.S. Muladi. Now it appears from the footnote under section 79 of the Act (pub­lished by the Government) that Notification in re­spect of "entire areas under the Police-Stations of Muladi, Mehendiganj...." was published in the ga­zette on 13 May 1958 that is long before 1967.<br/><br/>7. Dr. Kamal Hossain submitted as to the hard­ship of the plaintiff who had a registered kabuliyat of 1947 in his favour which the trial court found to be valid and genuine. This may be so but the court can­not help because of the legal provisions made in re­spect of diluviated lands. It is, however, upto the Government to consider the case of such people as the plaintiff with sympathy at the time of making settlement if they arc one of those seeking settle­ment.<br/>The answer to the question raised in this case is in the affirmative. The appeal is, accordingly, dis­missed without any order as to cost.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
