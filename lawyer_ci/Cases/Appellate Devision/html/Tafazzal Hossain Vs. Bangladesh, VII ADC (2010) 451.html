To give full effect to this fundamental principle of state policy the function of the municipality must be entrusted to a body composed of persons elected in accordance with law and no provisions of law can be made which may require or lead to entrustment of the func­tions to any nominated persons. The writ petition was heard on 04.06.2001 and Rule nisi was issued with interim order.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong> The writ petition was listed for hearing in the daily cause list of the High Court Division on 07.07.2009. But on that date the learned Advocate for the petitioner could not come to the court due to his per­sonal difficulty and the matter was taken up for hearing to discharge the Rule for default. Thereafter the learned Advocate for the petitioner filed an application for restoration of the writ petition to its origi­nal file and number after setting aside the order dated 07.07.2009 and the same was taken up for hearing on 13.07.2009 as an application as item No.175 to reject the same and also discharging the Rule by order dated 13.07.2009.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong> Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the judgment and order of the High Court Division the petitioner has filed this peti­tion for leave to appeal.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong> Heard Mr. Rokonuddin Mahmud, learned Counsel appearing for the peti­tioner and Mr. A. S.

So there is no reason to allow him to continue his function as chairman of the Pourashava which is absolutely question of merit of the writ petition which should be disposed of after giving sufficient opportunity of hearing to the writ petitioner but the petitioner got no chance of hearing on merit of the writ petition at the time of hearing of applica­tion for restoration which is against the principle of natural justice and as such the impugned order is liable to be set aside for the ends of justice.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong> The above submissions made on behalf of the petitioner merit consideration.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong> Leave is granted to consider the same.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong> Security of Tk. 1,000/- is to be deposited within 1 (one) month.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong> Preparation of paper book is dispensed with as prayed for.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong> The order of stay granted earlier shall continue till disposal of the appeal.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></span></div></div></div>
