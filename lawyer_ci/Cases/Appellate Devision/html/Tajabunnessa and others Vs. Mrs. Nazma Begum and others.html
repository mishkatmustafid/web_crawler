Afzal, J.</strong>) on 12<sup>th</sup> February, 1984.<br/><br/>2. Plaintiffs' predecessor Abdul Aziz Bepari instituted S.C.C. Suit No.1 of 1973 in the court of Small Causes Court Judge-cum-Munsif, 1st Court, Chandpur for eviction of defendant- respondent Nos. 1 and 2 from the suit premises. Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 were defendant Nos. 1 and 2 respectively in the suit. Defendant No. 2 was brought in and given possession of two rooms without the knowledge and consent of plaintiff Abdul Aziz Bepari who never recognised her as tenant. Appellant’s case was that defendant No.1 was a habitual defaulter. Further, the plaintiff bonafide required the suit premises for his own business. He served notices under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act upon both defendant Nos. 1 and 2. The tenancy was thus terminated on the expiry of December, 1972. As the defendant did not vacate the premises in question, suit for eviction was instituted. Defendant No. 2 who is respondent No.1 in this appeal alone contested the suit by filing a written statement. Her case was that she purchased the bharatia right of suit room from defendent No.1 who is respondent No. 2 herein with the knowledge and consent of the plaintiff who on accepting some rents from her recognised her as tenant in the suit room. Further she did not get any notice and also the plaintiff did not require the suit premises for his own use. Neither she nor defendant No.1 was habitual defaulters.<br/><br/>3. Trial court decreed the suit and directed that the plaintiff do get khas possession of the suit remises by evicting defendant Nos.1 and 2 therefrom Defendant No. 2 moved the High Court Division under section 25 of the Small Causes Courts Act and contended, inter alia, that as she was not a tenant under the Premises Rent Control Ordinance, 1963 present suit for eviction was not maintainable against her.<br/><br/>4. The learned Judge of the High Court Division, however, found that the suit for eviction was not maintainable against defendant No. 2 who is neither a sub-lessee nor a tenant under the plaintiff and accordingly set aside the judgment and decree of the trial Court.<br/><br/>5. The present appellants who are the heirs of the plaintiff Abdul Aziz Bepari moved this Court against the judgment of the High Court Division and obtained special leave to appeal in the following terms:<br/>"Mr. Kamrul Islam, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that admittedly defendant No.1 was a monthly tenant under the plaintiff and defendant No. 2 was inducted into the suit premises by defendant No.1 without knowledge and consent of the plaintiff. The learned Single Judge ought to have held that the defendant No. 2 was a sub-lessee under the plaintiff she being inducted by the monthly tenant defendant No.1, the suit cannot be dismissed on the ground of maintainability that she was a trespasser being an unauthorised occupant in the suit premises."<br/><br/>6. Mr. A.T.M. Kamrul Islam, Advocate for the appellants, contended that since the Courts below have found that defendant No. 1 who is respondent No. 2 in the present appeal was a monthly tenant under the predecessor of the appellants and was proved to be a habitual defaulter and he had, therefore, no longer any right to continue staying in the suit premises. His induction of defendant No. 2 who is respondent No.1 in these appeals was also found to be unauthorised as it was done without the consent and knowledge of the appellants' predecessor. The learned Advocate contended that the position of defendant No. 2 must be viewed as that of a sub-lessee of defendant No.1 and in such circumstances she was also liable to be evicted along with defendant No.1.<br/><br/>7. It appears that the High Court Division omitted to consider that when defendant No.1 was admittedly a tenant of the appellants' predecessor Abdul Aziz Bepari who inducted defendant No. 2 into the suit premises without the consent and knowledge of the latter such transaction was of the nature of a sub-lease, though not binding upon the landlord who was unaware of it. No question of giving consent to the sub-lease could, therefore, ever arise. Moreover, when the tenancy itself which was created in favour of defendant No.1 by the appellant's predecessor was terminated, a sub-lease in favour of defendant No. 2 by the tenant cannot be said to have subsisted.<br/><br/>8. It would be merely a legalistic approach if a conclusion is sought to be reached by saying that in such circumstances defendant No. 2 became a trespasser and, therefore, a suit for eviction did not lie against her. Technicalities of law may sometimes prove to be of great value in winning even a bad case, but when the very bottom of a case has been struck off, neither the plaintiff nor the defendant, as the case may be, can hope to score victory by desperately claiming to win on such technicalities alone. In the present case since the basis of the right of defendant No. 2 to stay on in the suit premises is found non-existent, she cannot be allowed to defeat the appellants' claim to evict her from the suit premises on the ground of some technical objection.<br/><br/>9. In the result, the appeals are allowed, judgments and decrees of the High Court Division are set aside and those of the trial Court restored. There will, however, be no order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
