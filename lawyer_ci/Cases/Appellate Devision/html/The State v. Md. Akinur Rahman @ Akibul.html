Akinur Rahman one year prior to the alleged occurrence. At the time of marriagethe accused demanded a bicycle, 6 annas of gold ornaments, gold ring weighting2 annas and cash Tk. 15,000/-and other household materials as dowry. For thewelfare of their daughter Swapna, the informant party paid Tk. 2000/ to buy abicycle, Tk. 2500 for the gold ornaments, Tk. 1200 for the ring and Tk. 7000/-out of cash Tk. 15000/-. After the marriage, her husband with his mother usedto torture and pressurise Swapna Begum for the remaining cash Tk. 8,000/-. Inthe mean time Swapna left her husband’s house and started to stay with herfather’s family from 12 days prior to the occurrence. Thereafter, the informantparty tried to sell their cow in the market but as the cattle price was lowthey could not sell it. They tried to convince Akinur that they would pay the restof the dowry money within 1 or 2 days. On 22.12.2002 Akinur went to the houseof his father-in-law and at about 8:30 p.m. Akinur and Swapna started for their own house. After that theinformant party went to sleep. In the next morning, i.e. on 23.12.2002 they wereawakened by the hue and cry of the neighbouring people, and they came to know that200 yards away from their house the dead body of Swapna was lying in the brinjalfield of Ayub Ali. Getting this news the informant and others went the place ofoccurrence and found the dead body of Swapna. Several marks of injury werefound on her body. </span><span style='Courier New"'>The informant suspected that the accused and hismother killed Swapna. On the request ofthe father of the deceased the informant being his brother lodged the F.I.R. onthe same day. </span></p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New"'>Afterinvestigation the police submitted charge   sheet under section 11 (Ka)/30 of theNari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 against both the accused. </p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New"'>Duringtrial the learned Judge of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal NO. 1,Rangpur, framed charge under section 11 (Ka) of the Nari-O-Shishu NirjatanDaman Ain, 2000 against the respondent and charge was framed against NaheraKhatun under section 11 (Ka)/30 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000.</p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New"'>Theprosecution examined as many as 10 witnesses while the defence examined none.The defence case as it transpires from the trend of cross-examination is thatthe accused respondent Akinur Rahman did not take away Swapna from her father’shouse and on the fateful night Swapna was in her father’s house and some bodymight have taken her into the brinjal field and committed rape therein andmurdered her by stabbing and the story of demand of dowry is false, concoctedand imaginary. No dowry was demanded nor was any dowry money paid to the respondentor his mother. Further case of the defence is that on the fateful night Swapnawas not in the custody of the accused rather she was residing in her parent’shouse. </p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New"'>Uponconcluding the trial, the learned trial Judge by his judgement and order dated 06.08.2005convicted the respondent under sections 11 (Ka) of the Nari-O-Shishu NirjatanDaman Ain, 2000 and sentenced him to death, while the other accused wasacquitted. </p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New"'>Reference was made under section 374 of theCode of Criminal Procedure which was registered as Death Reference No. 121 of2005. The respondent also filed Criminal Appeal No. 3425 of 2005 and JailAppeal No. 945 of 2005. By the impugned judgement and order, a Division Benchof the High Court Division rejected the death reference and allowed thecriminal appeal and Jail appeal, thereby acquitting the respondent. </p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New"'>Beingaggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgement and order, the Stateas petitioner filed the instant criminal petition for leave to appeal beforethis Division.</p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New"'>Mr.Biswajit Deb Nath, learned Deputy Attorney General appearing of behalf of the petitionersubmitted that the High Court Division in passing the judgement and orderacquitting the accused respondent in Death Reference No. 121 of 2005 rejectingthe same and thereby allowing the appeals failed to appreciate that there is astrong prima-facie and specific allegation of gang rape in a wife killing caseand the burden of proof lies upon the husband to explain the cause of death ofhis wife from his own custody, and this point was not at all considered by theHigh Court Division. He further submitted that the prosecution was able toprove its case beyond all reasonable doubt examining independent   charge-sheeted witnesses in support ofits case and the ingredients of the offence under section 11 (Ka) of theNari-O-Shishu Nirjata Daman Ain, 2000 have been proved and accordingly thelearned Judge of the trial Court applying his judicial mind awarded deathsentence to the accused respondent. The learned D.A.G. lastly submitted thatthe High Court Division passed the judgement and order rejecting the referenceand allowing the appeals without considering the evidence on record both oraland documentary and in a non- speaking judgement came to an erroneous findingand decision in acquitting the accused respondent, whereas all the prosecutionwitnesses corroborated each other to prove the prosecution case. </p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New"'>Mr. FazlulHoque Khan Farid, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent madesubmissions in support of the judgement and order of the High Court Division. </p><p style='text-align:justify;Courier New"'><span style="color:black;">We have considered the submissions of the learned D.A.G. appearing forthe State and learned Advocate for the respondent and the perused the impugnedjudgement and other connected papers on record.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none"><span style='Courier New";'>The High Court Division observedthat the house of the father of the deceased and the house</span><span style='Courier New"'> </span><span style='Courier New"'>of herhusband (the accused)are situated side by side and are surrounded by houses ofmany people, but no independent witness was examined by the InvestigatingOfficer nor cited as witness in this case, thus creating doubt. The High CourtDivision further observed that the victim was gang raped before her death, andthis aspect was not investigated by the I.O. thus creating serious doubt. TheHigh Court Division also took into consideration the fact that the defencesuggestion that on the fateful night the deceased was in the house of her father,and somebody might have taken her to the place of occurrence and committed rapeupon her and then killed, gets support from the prosecution witnesses and thecircumstances mentioned. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none"><span style='Courier New"'>It is truethat a case where section 106 of the Evidence Act is applicable, i.e. when thevictim was last seen with the alleged accused, the accused has a duty toexplain how the victim died. However, in the instant case there is noindependent corroborative witness with regard to the deceased being in thecompany of the accused in spite of the fact that the houses of the victim’sfather and that of her husband are near to each other and they are surroundedby many other houses of persons who would be independent witnesses, but no independentwitness was cited in the charge sheet or examined by the prosecution in supportof the prosecution case. Moreover, the allegation of the victim having beenkilled by her husband on account of non-payment of dowry is belied by the factthat the victim was apparently killed after having been gang raped as indictedin the post mortem report and supported by the inquest report. The defencesuggestion that the victim went out of her father’s house to watch a show atthe local school or that she may have been taken out of her father’s house andraped and killed thereafter cannot be overlooked in view of the finding of thepost mortem examination that the victim was gang raped. The fact of the victimhaving been gang raped is not commensurate with the prosecution claim that theaccused, being the husband, killed his wife for dowry. We also note from thecross examination of P.W. 3 Md. Mofazzel Hossain, who is a brother of theinformant that he stated</span><span style='Courier New"'> ""Bj¡l®j­u­L A‘¡a ®m¡®L doÑZ L­l j¡¢lu¡­R  B¢j<u>hm­a f¡¢lh e¡z</u>''</span><span style='Courier New"'>(emphasis added) which is clearly prevarication, particularlyin view of the fact that the post mortem examination report clearly indicatesgang rape prior to murder. </span></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none"><span style='Courier New"'>In view ofthe above discussion, we do not find any illegality or infirmity in theimpugned judgement and order of the High Court Division.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none"><span style='Courier New"'>Accordingly, we do not find</span><span style='Courier New";'> any reasonto interfere with the impugned judgement and order and hence the criminalpetition for leave to appeal is dismissed.</span><span style='Courier New";color:#993300;'> </span><span style='line-height:200%;Courier New";color:#993300;'></span></p><span id="pastemarkerend"></span> </div></div>
