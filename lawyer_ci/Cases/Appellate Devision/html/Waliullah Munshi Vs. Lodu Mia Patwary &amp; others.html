Afzal and Justice Nurul Huque Bhuiyan</strong> on 30th October 1984).<br/><br/>2. Respondent No 1 instituted Title Suit No. 181 of 1979 in the court of Subordinate Judge, Noakhali for declaration that the suit land was not vested and non-resident property. Allegations were that the suit land was pur­chased in auction in Money Execution Case No. 47 of 1961 by several persons, namely, Subhas Chandra Pal having 8 annas share. Jaheda Khatun having 4 annas share and Shamsul Huq Miaji having 4 annas share each. By an amicable partition they were in posses­sion of the suit land. Plaintiff-respondent pur­chased Jaheda Khatun's share from her heirs and also purchased the share of Subash Chan­dra Pal on 2nd December 1978. Since his purchase plaintiff-respondent had been posses­sing the same. Defendant No. 1 in collusion with defendant No. 2 managed to get the suit land on lease as vested and non-resident property. This having cast cloud upon his title, plaintiff instituted the suit for declaration. According to defendant No. 1 who is the appellant, plaintiff's claim that he purchased the suit land was false and his kabalas are forged; Further, plaintiff's vendor was never a citizen of this country and therefore, no ques­tion of auction purchase of the suit land by him could arise. Also, plaintiff was never in posse­ssion of the suit land. Appellant got the suit land by way of lease as it was vested and non-resident property. On 7th February 1981 when the suit was fixed for peremptory for striking out the name of the appellant from the plaint alleging that though it trans­pired at the time of filing the suit that he was a leasee, in fact, defendant No. 1 being not a leasee of the suit land he was an unnece­ssary party. Plaintiff's prayer was rejected by the learned Subordinate Judge against which plaintiff preferred Civil Revision No. 28 of 1981 under section 115(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure before District Judge, Noakhali who allowed the revision case and struck out the name of defendant No. 1 from the plaint. Defendant No. 1 then filed Civil Revi­sion No. 140 of 1983 under section 115(3), C.P.C. before the High Court Division. The learned Judges of the High Court Division who heard the aforesaid revision affirmed the judgment of District Judge, Noakhali.<br/><br/>3. Being aggrieved, defendant No. 1 moved this Court and obtained special leave to ap­peal on the following terms:—<br/>"Mr. M.H. Khandker, the learned Counsel, appearing for the defendant-petitioner contended that the nature of the suit should be looked into. It was, not a title suit. It was more a suit foe declaration that the suit land is not vested and non-resident property. Reliance was placed by the High Court Division in the decision reported in <em><strong>31 DLR 107</strong></em>. It was not warranted inasmuch as the defendant being a lessee has his own right to protect the interest of his and of his lessor and in such case the party who was interested in the suit property ought not to have been struck off. Points merits consideration."<br/><br/>4. Mr. M.H. Khandker, Counsel for the appellant, submitted that appellant who is a lessee in respect of the suit land cannot be termed as an unnecessary party, firstly, be­cause he as a lessee in respect of the suit land is entitled to defend his right as such though the suit was for mere declaration that the suit land is not vested and non-resident property. Secondly, he has been impleaded as defendant No. 1 in the suit by plaintiff-respondent him­self who cannot now be allowed to turn back and say that he is not a necessary or proper party in the suit. The learned Counsel took exception to the finding of the High Court Division wherein the learned Judge held that "admittedly the lessee must rise and fall with his lessor and the defendant- petitioner (appellant) not having setup any case except that of a lessee in his written statement, he is neither a necessary nor a proper party in the suit". In this connection he referred to the provisions of section 108F (d)-(g) and the case of <em><strong>Prassanna Moyee vs. Kali Das, (1881) 9 Cal. L.R. 347.</strong></em> Further, the decision repor­ted in <em><strong>31 DLR</strong></em> 107 being not a case for stri­king out a party is distinguishable from the present suit and as such reliance placed upon it by the learned Judges of the High Court Division is wrong.<br/><br/>5. It is not clear to us how the plaintiff-respondent after a long lapse of time from the date of filing of the suit in which he also impleaded defendant-appellant, felt the necessity for striking cut his name from the pliant on the ground that he was not a necessary party. The suit out of which this appeal has arisen is, it is true, not a suit for title or pos­session but for a declaration that the suit land is not vested and non-resident property and that being so relief is sought against the Go­vernment. Had not the Government in the meantime leased out the suit land to anybody, obviously no such interest would have existed. This act of leasing out after treating the suit property as vested and non-resident has led to the creation of interest in favour of the lessee, the defendant-appellant, which now gives him the standing. The creation of such interest, he may quite legitimately claim, has cast an obligation upon him to protect it. If the appellant, particularly when he has been implea­ded in the suit, now proceeds to protect his in­terest in the suit land, no exception can possibly be taken. At the same time it may be necessary to point out that the lessee may have more reasons or urgency to protect his interest in the suit land than the lessor. The interests of lessor and lessee may not always be the same so as to hold that the presence of lessor as defendant in a suit suffices and lessee's presence is not necessary and may, therefore, be dispensed with. Though in the suit plain­tiff-respondent has sought relief against the Government, defendant-appellant may be affec­ted if he succeeds in obtaining the relief by way of getting the declaration. That the suit would positively have its intended effect on the validity of the lease by the Government has quite rightly been foreseen by the appellant.<br/>For the reasons stated above, the appeal is allowed; the judgment and order of the High Court Division are set aside and the suit being T.S. No. 181 of 1979 of the Court of Subor­dinate Judge, Lakshmipur will now proceed in accordance with law. There will, however, be no order as to costs.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
