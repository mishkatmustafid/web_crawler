No. 1 of 1980).<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Judgment</strong></span></div><strong>                       </strong><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A. T. M. Afzal J.-</strong> Contesting defendants No.1 and 3 in a suit for partition being Title Suit No. 17 of 1975 of the 3rd Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka, are appellants in this appeal by leave.<br/><br/>2. Plaintiff-respondent No.1 brought the suit claiming an area of .1100 ajutangsha out of .4264 ajutangsha of schedule "A" to the plaint which has been described as follows:<br/>"Schedule "A"<br/>Within Dacca Collectorate P. S. Ramna, Mouza Ramna S. A. Khatian No. 174 S. A. Plot No. 1162 Nature of land Pucca house, Area .4264 Ajutangsha."<br/>3. The learned Subordinate Judge decreed the suit fully in preliminary form subject to payment of advolorem Court Fee on the valuation of the suit by judgment and decree dated 23.6.79. On appeal by the defendant-appellants, the High Court Division, Dha­ka by the impugned Judgment and decree dated 22 March 1984 modified the decree of the trial Court by holding that "the plaintiff do get a saham of .1062-1/2 acre of land out of "A" schedule property on par­tition by metes and bounds".<br/><br/>4. Now there is no controversy as to the issues and points raised and decided in the suit and the ap­peal. The plaintiffs share as declared by the High Court Division finally is also not in question.<br/><br/>5. But leave has been obtained on a technical point alleging error and incompleteness in the order passed by the High Court Division. It is this "that the plaintiff having acquired no right, title and inter­est in the demarcated '0464 acre of C. S. Plot No. 16, '0875 acre of C. S. Plot No. 17 and .0800 acre of C. S. Plot No. 19 totally measuring '2134 acre which have been included in '4264 acre of S. A. Plot No. 1162 of S. A. Khatian No. 174, as has been described in Schedule "A" to the plaint, the learned Judges of the High Court Division have committed substantial error of law in failing to direct to identify and demarcate .2125 acre of C. S. Plot No. 17, as had been purchased by the defendant Nos.1 and 2 by their deeds dated 4.1.54 and 5.1.54 out of land of Schedule 'A' to the plaint and to allot a saham of 1062-1/2 acre to the plaintiff only out of the said de­marcated area of '2125 acre and dismiss the suit with regard to the rest of the disputed Plot No. 1162."<br/><br/>6. It may be stated at the outset that the objec­tion as above was not raised in the First Appeal be­fore the High Court Division. The appellants, there­fore, cannot find fault with the impugned order passed by the High Court Division. Even then we shall examine if there is any substance in the con­tention raised.<br/><br/>7. The question is: Is any direction necessary to identify and demarcate beforehand .2125 acre of C.S. Plot No. 17 in order to effect partition of the suit land? It is true that the Plaintiff has stated in his plaint that Defendant No.1 and his (Plaintiffs) vendor defendant No.2 Abedulla obtained well-demarcated .2125 ajutangsha land from C. S. Plot No. 17 under two registered deeds dated 4.1.54 and 5.1.54 and started possession by erecting structures, etc. The Plaintiff has claimed his share on the basis of his purchase from defendant No. 2 Abedulla by two registered kabalas dated 5.2.74 and 15.2.74. Let us see, briefly, how the plaintiff has stated his case in the plaint with reference to the records of right—C.S. and S.A—and whether defendants have raised an objection at any stage with regard to the correctness of the S. A. record on the basis of which the suit has been instituted and contested.<br/><br/>8. Admittedly suit involves three original C. S. Plots no. 16, 17 and 19. One Sonabi Bewa had raiyati jote right in the first two plots and she pos­sessed .08 decs, of land of C.S. Plot No. 19. Plain­tiffs case is that the heirs of Sonabi Bewa transferred the said lands to Ram Charan Ramani by a registered deed of sale dated 20.12.46 who in turn made a trans­fer to Mvi. Mohammad Elahadad on 22.3.47 except a small portion of C. S. Plot No. 16 which he had transferred to one Nagar Bashi Gope. While the heirs of Mohammad Elahadad were in possession of the said lands, the plaint reads, they transferred aforesaid well-demarcated .2125 ajutangsha land from C. S. Plot No. 17 to defendant Nos. 1 and 2 by two regis­tered deeds i. c. lease and rent sale deeds dated 4.1. 54 and 5.1. 54 and possession was delivered to the transferees. The aforesaid heirs then transferred .3100 ajutangsha from C.S. Plot no. 17 by two registered deeds dated 18. 2. 54 and 20. 2. 54 to defendant Nos. 1 and 3 and delivered possession to the purchasers.<br/><br/>9. It has been stated in the plaint that thus the defendant Nos. 1-3 acquired '3000 ajut land' in plot No. 17 and .3100 ajut in plot No. 16 by different deeds and they also got possession in .0800 ajut land in C. S. plot No. 19 which their predecessors were in adverse possession from tong before. Defendant Nos. 1 to 3 were new persons in the locality. They went into possession after purchase but on measure­ment it was found that they actually got .3000 ajut in plot No. 17, .0464 ajut in plot No .16 and .0800 ajut in plot No .19—in all .4264 ajut land in the three plots. The defendants remained satisfied with the said area and when S.A. operation began, the land been correctly recorded in the name of defen­dants 1-3 in S. A. Khatian No .174, Plot No. 1162 and the same record had been confirmed in all subsequent proceedings.<br/><br/>10. Plaintiffs further case is that defendant No. 2 while in ejmali possession of the said S. A. plot No. 1162 with his other co-purchasers, who are his full elder brother and brother's wife, defendants 1 and 3, by making some amicable arrangement without any measurement and partition by metes and bounds transferred '1100 ajutangsha out of '4264 ajutangsha of S. A. Plot No. 1162 (schedule B to the plaint) by two registered sale deeds dated 5.2.74 and 15.2.74 to the plaintiff for a total consideration of Tk. 83,000/-and delivered possession thereof.<br/><br/>11. The defendant-appellants' main contention was that the defendant No.2 had no title and interest in S.A. Plot No. 1162 as he was only a name-lender in the documents dated 4.1.54 and 5.1.54 by which '2125 ajut land out of C.S. Plot No. 17 was obtained by defendant 1 and defendant 2, the latter being the younger brother of the former and allegedly minor at the relevant time. This contention has been nega­tived concurrently by the trial Court and the High Court Division. The defendant-appellants, however, never raised any objection as to the correctness of the S.A. Record or the amalgamation of the interests as under the C.S. records as described by the plaintiff in his plaint.<br/><br/>12. In the First Appeal the only objection was regarding identity of the suit land. It was sought to be contended that unless the specific portions of C.S. Plot Nos. 16, 17 and 19 are relayed by local investigation, it cannot be said which portion of those three plots comprises S.A. Plot No. 1162. The High Court Division observed in its judgment that the defendants raised no objection to the recording of this S.A. Khatian, rather they accepted the same as correct and paid rent on the bash of Ext. 5. After his purchase the plaintiff mutated his name in S.A. Khatian No. 174 to which the contesting de­fendants raised no objection. The High Court Divi­sion further observed that the defendants took no step to relay the C.S. Plots at the trial nor they challenged the framing of the suit on the basis of S.A. Khatian No. 174.<br/><br/>13. It will be seen that the plaintiff claims to have acquired title to the suit land on the basis of his purchase from defendant No.2 following S.A. record. He instituted the suit on the basis of the same S.A. Plot No. 1162 of S.A. Khatian No. 174 to which the appellants never raised any objection at any time. In these circumstances it is difficult to agree with the submission of Mr. Pal that a direction is necessary to identify and demarcate '2125 acre of C.S. Plot No. 17 before allowing a saham of '1062-1/2 acre to the plaintiff. In the context of the crea­tion of the new Jama under the S.A. Khatian on the basis of which the plaintiff claims title and brought the suit for partition and regard being had to the fact that the appellants raised no objection as to the recording and consolidation of interests under the S.A. Khatian No. 174 as asserted by the plaintiff, there is neither any reason nor necessity now for de­marcating beforehand the area of land purchased by defendants 1 and 2 out of original C.S. Plot No. 17. The demarcation of the plaintiffs share out of S A Plot No. 1162 will be done by the Advocate Com­missioner having regard to all the principles of parti­tion and the defendants can take objection, if any, before the decree is made final.<br/><br/>14. In the result, therefore, the appeal must fail. It is dismissed without any cost.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
