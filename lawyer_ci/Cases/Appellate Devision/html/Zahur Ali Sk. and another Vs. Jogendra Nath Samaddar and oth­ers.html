Abdul Matin J. -</strong> These petitions for leave to appeal are directed against the judgment and order dated 31.08.2006 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision Nos. 4217 of 1998 and 386 of 1999 discharging the Rule.<br/><br/>2. The facts, in short, are that the plaintiff opposite parties instituted Title Suit No. 222 of 1994 in the 2nd Court of the learned Subordinate Judge, Bagerhat for declaration of the Title confirmation of possession and for permanent injunction against the petitioners and defendants opposite parties alleging, <em>inter alia</em>, that the original land of the plaintiffs under R.S. and S.A. khatian is situated on the eastern side of the river Baloswar, that char land came to the surface from the bed of the river before 1950 and accreted to the original land of the plaintiffs, that sur­veyor and tahshildar of the Government prepared map of the accreted land, that the plaintiffs prayed for separation of this rent, their rent, that proposal was sent to the sub divisional officer, Bagerhat who forwarded it to the Additional Deputy Commissioner, Khulna who approved the proposal and separate rent was taken from the plaintiffs for the accreted land, that the plaintiffs have been in peaceful possession of their original land along with the accreted land for more than 32 years, that in order to deprive the plaintiffs of their valuable land the surveyor and kanungo of the Government office suppressed the pre­vious map and they prepared new map and with the connivance of the higher officers of the Government the defendants took settlement of the accreted land in their names which has clouded the title of the plaintiffs and as such they have been con­strained to institute the suit to protect their interests.<br/><br/>3. The defendant-respondent Nos.1-3 filed joint written statements denying the material allegations made in the plaint and contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the char land began to from after the operation of Chap­ter V of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act when the current in the River Baloswar became weak and in 1970 when the information of the char land was com­plete and it became fit for cultivation gov­ernment enquired into the matter and then treated the char land as government khas land and settled the char land amongst the landless peasants against D.C.R. and they further stated that the plaintiffs have no title or possession in the char land.<br/><br/>4. The defendant Nos. 4, 6, 9-10, 14, 16-20 filed another set of joint written state­ments denying the material allegations made in the plaint and contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that during 1962-1963 char land began to form in the river land in 1970-1971 some tress and bushes were found in the char land and these defendants used to cut away these trees and bushes, that sub­sequently the Government surveyed the char land and prepared map and the Government made this char land their khas land and settled 1.00 acre to each of the defendants on yearly basis and in 1974 the Government permanently settled this land with the landless peasants including the defendants by registered lease deeds, that this defendants mutated their names, paid rent to the Government and pos­sessed this land for more then 12 years to the knowledge of all concerned and they have also acquired title in the suit land by adverse possession.<br/><br/>5. The trial Court dismissed the suit and the plaintiffs preferred appeal before the learned District Judge and the learned Additional District Judge and the learned Additional District Judge, Bagerhat allowed the appeal and decreed the suit.<br/><br/>6. The defendant preferred revisional application before the High Court Division and the High Court Division by the impugned judgment and order affirmed the judgment of the appellate Court and discharged the Rule.<br/><br/>7. As against the judgment and order of the High Court Division the petitioners have preferred this petition for leave to appeal.<br/><br/>8. Heard the learned Counsel and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.<br/><br/>9. It appears that the High Court Division correctly found that the suit in question is maintainable under Order 1 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure as the plaintiffs cause of action arose from the same trans­action.<br/>10. It further appears that the High Court Division correctly concurred with the finding of the appellate court that the land in question was accreted land and the plaintiffs took lease from the Government in the year 1970 under Section 87 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act and they have been in possession for long 32 years and correctly decreed the suit.<br/>We find no merit in these petitions which are accordingly dismissed.<br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
