Eventually, the said appeal was transmitted to the Court of Additional District Judge, 8<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka for disposal, who by the impugned judgment and order dated 17.4.2007 disallowed the Revision and affirmed the order of the trial Court dated 13.8.2006 and the instant Revision application is directed against that judgment and order.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Ibrahim Khalil, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioners submits that the defendant-opposite party clearly stated in paragraph No.8 of the written statement that the suit is bad for defect of parties inasmuch as the wife of the defendant is owner of the suit property by purchase but the plaintiffs did not implead  her in the suit  though  both the Courts blow without applying its judicial mind into the facts and circumstances of the case and law bearing on the subject most illegally rejected the prayer for addition of party and the same has occasioned failure of justice. This is the only ground urged by the learned Advocate for the petitioners.<br/><br/>Mr. A. K. Mojibur Rahman, the learned Advocate appearing for the defendant-opposite party, on the other hand, opposes the Rule. He submits that the Courts below were perfectly justified in refusing the petitioner’s prayer for addition of party on the clear finding that the wife of sole defendant is not at all necessary party in the instant case.<br/><br/>I have considered the submission of the learned Advocates for both the sides and perused the Revision application, impugned judgment and other materials on record. The only question that is to be decided in the rule is, whether the Courts below have committed any illegality in rejecting the prayer for addition of party. It appears that the plaintiff-petitioners filed a suit for permanent injunction against the sole defendant-opposite party. The defendant-opposite party entered appearance in the suit and filed written statement denying most of the allegations of the plaint. The material portion of the written statement  reads as follows: “মোকদ্দমাটি পক্ষভাব দোষে বারিত, বিবাদীর সএী নালিশা ভূমিতে খরিদ সুত্রে মালিক দখলকার. তাহাকে মোকদ্দমায় পক্ষ না করায় মোকদ্দমাটি পক্ষভাব দোষে অচল ও অরক্ষনীয়”<br/><br/>On that, the plaintiff-petitioners filed an application under Order 1, Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure for adding the wife of the sole defendant as defendant No.2. The trial Court rejected the prayer for addition of party on the ground that since there is no allegation of threat against the wife of sole defendant in a suit for permanent injunction, she is not a necessary party. In revision, the learned Additional District Judge, 8<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka, however, affirmed the order of the trial Court.<br/><br/>As, I have already  noticed that in this case the sole defendant entered appearance in the suit and filed written statement stating  that the suit  is  bad for non-joinder of necessary parties as  the  wife of the sole defendant  is the owner of the suit property by purchase though the plaintiffs did not implead her in the suit.<br/><br/>The proposition of law is by now well settled that  any one is entitled to be added as a party in a suit even he is a stranger, if he has direct interest, legal or equitable, in the dispute.<br/><br/>Admittedly, in this case the sole defendant in his written statement stated that the suit is bad for defect of party since the wife of the sole defendant is the owner of the suit property by purchase though the plaintiffs did not implead her in the suit. Thus, it does not lie in the mouth of the defendant-opposite party that the wife of defendant is not a necessary party. I do not think therefore that the Courts below made a correct approach to the simple problem. The impugned judgment as well as order of the trial Court does not reflect the true position of law and fact.<br/><br/>For the reasons stated above, I am inclined to hold that the learned Additional District Judge, 8<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka seriously erred in law in affirming  the  order dated 13.8.2006 passed by the learned Senior Assistant Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Dhaka in Title Suit No.399 of 2002 rejecting the application for addition of party  without properly applying his judicial mind into the facts and circumstances of the case and law bearing on the subject and the same has resulted in an error in the impugned decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/><br/>The Rule is, therefore,  made absolute without any order as to cost, the impugned judgment and order dated 17.4.2007 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, 8<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka in Civil Revision No.410 of 2006 as well as  order of the trial Court dated 13.8.2006 passed in Title Suit No.399 of 2002 are set-aside and consequently, the application for addition of party dated 13.08.2006 of the plaintiff petitioners is allowed, Nazli Begum, the wife of sole defendant is added as defendant No. 2 in the suit.<br/><br/>Since, the matter has been dragging over a period of 10(ten) years, the trial Court concerned is directed to proceed with the suit expeditiously without giving any adjournment to any of the parties in accordance with law.<br/><br/>Let a copy of this judgment be communicated to the Courts concerned at once.<br/><br/><strong>End.</strong></div></div></div>
