And he further submits that there is no materials on records to show that the accused appellant demanded dowry to the victim as well as the informant so the charged under section 11Ka/30 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 against the appellant is not maintainable and thereby conviction and sentenced thereunder is also bad in law thus liable to be set aside. He lastly submits that the post mortem report of Doctor did  not mention the age of injury for which the appellant did not take fair defence thus he became seriously prejudiced as well as it cast a doubt in the post mortem report therefore the impugned judgment passed in pursuance of said post mortem report is not maintainable and thus the same is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Mr. Bashir Ahmed, the learned Assistant Attorney General appearing on behalf of the state and submits that the learned trial Court after considering the prosecution witnesses he found that the accused appellant committed the offence of injuries for which victim dead and thereby charge under section 11(Ka) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 against the appellant was legal and proper and conviction and sentenced under section 11(kha) of the said Act also legal and proper and the trial Court committed no more illegality in passing the impugned judgment. He further submits that immediately after occurrence the accused appellant without taking any steps cancelled himself so the conduct of the appellant alongwith the facts and circumstances of the case well proved the charge against the accused appellant and thereby the judgment passed by the Tribunal was legal and proper one.

One bruise on the left inguenal region (</strong>তলপেটের বাম নিম্ন প্রান্তদেশ<strong>) region about 2”x1”, there was also one old scar mark at the back of the elbow.”</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;">And as per the opinion the Doctor of the Board that the death as due to injury which are ant-mortem and homicidal in nature. In his cross-examination he stated that he did not mention the age of injury and he denied the suggestion of the defence.<br/> </div><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;">P. W. 7, S. I. Nazrul Islam he stated in his chief that while he was on duty at Chuadanga Police Station he engaged as a investigating officer on 03.09.2002 of the Case and during course of investigation he held the inquest report of dead body of victim Sagorika and send the deadbody to the Chuadanga Sadar Hospital for post mortem and he identified his inquest report along with signature which was marked as Exhibit 2 and 2/1. He visited the place of occurrence and prepared the sketch map alongwith index and that sketch map and index were exhibited as Exhibitros 3, 3/1, 4 and 4/1. He recorded the statement of the witnesses under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. And after holding investigation he submitted charge sheet against the accused appellant and another under section 11Ka /30 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000. In his cross examination he stated that in the surathal report Alfaz put his LTI and denied the suggestion of the defence.<br/><br/>These are the evidences led by the prosecution side.<br/><br/>It appears that the P. W. 1 after getting information lodged the FIR against the accused appellant and others alleging  that due to demand of dowry money his daughter was tortured by the accused appellant and others on  01.09.2002 and for which his daughter met her death in the Hospital on 03.04.2002 . He deposed before the Court in support of the FIR story and P. W. 2 also corroborated with the evidence of P. W. 1 and P. W. 3 immediately after occurrence heard about the commission of offence by the accused appellant from the brother’s wife of the appellant and P. W. 4 who was along with the victim she at the hospital up to her death and before death she was informed by the victim that her husband tortured the victim and due to his torture he became so sick and there is no reason to disbelieve the deposition of P. W. 3 and 4 and P. W. 5 was tendered and cross examination was declined by the defence and P.W. 6 is the Doctor who found two injuries on right side of the umbilical region and another left inguenal region and their opinion to the effect that death was due to injury mentioned which was anti-mortem and homicidal in nature  these evidences shows and well proved that the victim met her death due to those injuries and P. Ws. 1-4 along with the deposition of investigating officer and sketch map shows that the place of occurrence has mentioned in the index in the sketch map and in where index shows that <strong>“</strong>ঘটনাস্থল ১নং আসামী আজিজ এর বসত ঘর।<strong>”</strong> the place of occurrence was not denied in manner by the defence in any point of time so it is well clear that the occurrence took place within the residence of the husband of the victim and as per the evidence of P. Ws. 3 and 4 that husband of victim Abdul Aziz tortured the victim and due to that tortured she met her death in the hospital on 03.09.2002 and another exceptional circumstances is that immediately after occurrence the accused appellant concealed himself from the trial and even he did not take any step to explain under what circumstances her wife met her  death this burden of prove heavily lies upon the accused appellant as the husband of victim and while the occurrence took place with in his custody.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate for the appellant submits that the age of injury was not mentioned in the postmortem report for which the accused appellant has been seriously prejudiced. It appears that the date of occurrence took place on 01.09.2002 and thereafter he was taken to the hospital by the accused which was not denied and subsequently she made her death on 03.09.2002 that fact was also not been denied by the defence and immediately after death the surathal report was prepared by the investigation officer and post mortem was held on 03.09.2002 on the same date. So non mentioning the age of injury by the Doctor did not make the prejudice to the appellant in any manner under the facts and circumstances of the present case. Therefore the prosecution well proved the charge against the accused appellant.<br/><br/>Under the above facts and circumstances of the case, we find that the learned trial Court did not commit any illegality in passing the impugned judgment. However, it appears that the accused appellant did not use any deadly weapons for commission of injury and it also further appears that the victim was given treatment by local doctor and subsequently she was taken into hospital for her treatment. Thus it shows that the accused appellant at least do not have the mensrea to kill her. Considering the same and the extenuating circumstances we find that ends of justice will be met if the sentence is reduced to 10 years from life therefore we reduced the sentence of the appellant to 10 years rigorous imprisonment instead of imprisonment for life.<br/><br/>With the above modification the appeal is dismissed.<br/><br/>Send down the lower Court records together with copy of the judgment to the courts below at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
