The defendant No. 1 (Jamuna Oil Company Ltd) contested the suit by filing written statement on 07.08.2002, denying the material allegations of the plaint, and making a counter-claim of Tk. 39,38,371.47 alleging short landing of its cargo by the plaintiff. The said Admiralty Suit No. 5 of 2002 was dismissed for default on 18.03.2010. By the Judgment and Order dated 10.03.2011, the counter-claim of the defendant No. 1 was decreed in favour of the defendant No. 1 and against the plaintiff for an amount of Tk. 39,38,371.47 and, against the said Judgment and Order, the plaintiff filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 1819 of 2011, which was dismissed by the Hon’ble Appellate Division by its Judgment and Order dated 15.11.2015. Against the aforesaid Judgment dated 15.11.2015, the plaintiff filed Civil Review Petition No. 173 of 2016, which was pending before the Hon’ble Appellate Division at the time of filing the instant application and, subsequently, it has been dismissed for default (non-appearance) on 15.11.2018. Meanwhile, the defendant No. 1 as decree-holder filed the instant Execution Case No. 02 of 2013, and had the coastal tanker M.T. ASHA attached for sale through auction. The plaintiff filed an application on 23.10.2017 praying for stay of the auction-sale along with an account-payee cheque for an amount of Tk. 39,38,372/- equivalent to the decreetal amount. Upon hearing the application, this Court passed an Order dated 23.10.2017 staying the auction proceedings and, upon considering the ill health of the Managing Director of the plaintiff-company, allowed until 23.02.2018 for encashment of the said cheque, ordering that otherwise a proceeding shall be caused under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881(shortly, NI Act). As the plaintiff was unable to arrange for encashment of the cheque, this Court by Order dated 27.02.2018 asked the plaintiff to show cause as to why a proceeding under the NI Act shall not be initiated against it, and further vacated the Order of stay on auction proceedings and directed the Marshall to take steps for auction-sale of the vessel. The auction notice was published on 10.03.2018, and the auction was held on 20.03.2018. On the day of the auction i.e. 20.03.2018, the auction-purchaser, Al-Haj Abul Kalam Azad (Babul), Proprietor M/s Padma Ship Recycling Industries, bid an amount of Tk. 1,05,70,700/-, which was the highest bid for the vessel, submitting a Pay Order of 10% of the bid-money as earnest money. Against the Order dated 20.03.2018 holding the auction, the plaintiff filed CMP No. 361 of 2018, along with a Bank Guarantee for the decreetal amount, and the Hon’ble Judge-in-Chambers was pleased to pass an Order dated 27.03.2018 staying the auction and directed for the Bank Guarantee to be kept with the Registrar General of the Supreme Court, where it remains till date unencashed. The ensuing Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 2573 of 2018, however, was dismissed by Order dated 07.08.2018. Thereafter, the auction-sale was confirmed by this Court’s Order dated 13.08.2018. Now, when an application by the auction-purchaser for a direction to deliver the vessel is pending before this Court, the plaintiff has come up with this application praying for recalling this Court’s above-mentioned Order dated 13.08.2018, upon depositing two separate Pay Orders, one for satisfaction of the decreetal amount and another in the name of the auction-purchaser as solatium.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The auction-purchaser is contesting this application by filing written objection contending, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">inter-alia</em>, that the Judgment-Debtor (plaintiff) having exhausted all the stages in the suit and, thereafter, again all the stages in the execution case, now has come up with this device with a malafide intention to abuse the process of this Court and simply attempting to harass this bonafide auction-purchaser. The auction held on 20.03.2018 was a continuation of the auction process that was initiated by publication of auction notices 1st time on 17.10.2017. The Judgment-Debtor, including his counsel in person, has made several representations or promises to this Court for paying off the decreetal amount, but ultimately it proved that the Judgment-Debtor persistently flouted with the Court proceedings and obtained unfair advantage to delay the process of execution. It is stated that the Judgment-Debtor obtained stay of the auction 1<sup>st</sup> time on 23.10.2017 by misleading this Court with a cheque for paying the decreetal amount, but the cheque was dishonored. The Judgment-Debtor also misled the Hon'ble Appellate Division by presenting a Bank Guarantee which was encashable after 6 (six) months and also presenting blank cheque instead of Pay Order as per the direction of the Court, which the Appellate Division refused to accept.  </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Mr. Mustafizur Rahman Khan, the learned Advocate appearing for the Judgment-Debtor contends that there has been serious illegalities in calling and holding the auction for selling the vessel inasmuch as the auction-sale was held on 20.03.2018, while the notice for such auction-sale was given only on 10.03.2018; that is to say, there was only 10 (ten) days between the notice and the auction. By taking me through Order 21 Rule 68 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC), he submits that in the case of property of the kind described in the Proviso to Order 21 Rule 43 of the CPC, no sale in execution shall, without the consent in writing of the Judgment-Debtor, take place until after the expiration of at least 30 (thirty) days in the case of immovable property, and of at least 15 (fifteen) days in the case of movable property, calculated from the date on which the copy of the proclamation has been affixed on the Court-house of the Judge ordering the sale and the proclamation has to be in the form prescribed under Order 21 Rule 66 of the CPC. He submits that the Proviso of Order 21 Rule 43 of the CPC is inapplicable in the instant case in that the said provision concerns goods which are subject to speedy and natural decay or when the expense of keeping it in custody is likely to exceed its value. In an effort to elaborate his above submissions, he contends that in the instant case, the first proclamation that approximates the requirement of Order 21 Rule 66 of the CPC was not published until 10.03.2018 and, hence, the property intended to be sold being a movable property, the auction-sale ought not to have occurred until 25.03.2018. He submits that the requirement under Order 21 Rule 68 of the CPC is a substantive requirement of law, as opposed to a procedural one, in view of the provision of Order 21 Rule 69(3) of the CPC, which provides that every sale shall be stopped if, before the lot is knocked down, the debt and costs including the costs of the sale, are tendered to the officer conducting sale, or proof is given to his satisfaction that the amount of such debt and costs have been paid into Court which ordered the sale. According to Mr. Khan, Order 21 Rule 69(3) of the CPC gives an opportunity to the Judgment-Debtor to pay off the decreetal amount along with costs, even after the proclamation of sale of 15 (fifteen) days in case of a movable property, before any auction takes place, unless the Judgment-Debtor has consented to a shorter period under Order 21 Rule 68 of the CPC. He argues that since in the instant case, the plaintiff had never consented to a shorter period under Order 21 Rule 68 of the CPC, the auction suffers from an illegality for violating the said provisions of Order 21 Rule 68 of the CPC, which is to the prejudice of the rights to property of the plaintiff. Mr. Khan forcefully submits that this is a serious illegality, which cannot be regarded as a procedural irregularity within the terms of Order 21 Rule 78 of the CPC not vitiating the sale. In an effort to buttress up his argument on this issue, he refers to the case of Narayan Chandra Vs Manhar Mandal 43 DLR(AD) 152 and submits that on the ground of non-compliance of these provisions the Appellate Division set aside the auction-sale held in the afore-cited case. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">5.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">He, then, alleges that as per the plaintiff’s claim, the market value of the vessel is about 20 (twenty) crore, but the vessel has been sold in auction only at 1 (one) crore and odds.

But this information was not disclosed to the Hon’ble Presiding Judge of the Admiralty Court at the time of filing the application for confirmation of auction-sale on 13.08.2018. He contends that had this information been placed before the Hon’ble Presiding Judge on 13.08.2018, the auction-sale would not have been confirmed by the Hon’ble Presiding Judge.

Haque, the learned Advocate appearing for the auction-purchaser submits that the Hon’ble Appellate Division has affirmed both the original Judgments and Decree and the auction-sale in the execution case, and the Appellate Division having not found any legal infirmity in the Orders passed by the High Court Division upheld the auction-sale on both the occasions. By placing the provisions of Order 21 Rule 77(2) of the CPC, Mr. Haque submits that upon payment of the purchase-money, the auction-sale has been finalized and the sale has become absolute and the auction-purchaser has acquired the legal title in the property which cannot be taken away or circumvented. He submits that it is now an obligation for the executing Court to deliver the moveable property to the auction-purchaser under Order 21 Rule 79 of the CPC. By referring to the case of Fariduddin Chowdhury Vs. Sylhet Gas Works Ltd 1995 BLT (AD) 168 and the case of Sonali Bank Vs. Artharin Adalat 15 MLR (AD) 20, Mr. Haque submits that once the auction is completed, no relief is available against such auction-sale, as there is no provision in any law or in Order 21 of the CPC to set aside a confirmation of sale in case of moveable property. He submits that once the sale is confirmed and made absolute, the Judgment-Debtor losses his right to receive back the property in question even on satisfying the decreetal amount. He argues that if the confirmation of sale is set aside in the present case, it will tantamount to declaring the title of the auction-purchaser nugatory, thereby, extending and giving an unwarranted benevolence to the Judgment-Debtor. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">9.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">He submits that the auction-sale was conducted as per the law in compliance with Order 21 Rule 68 of the CPC. He further submits that the specification of time in Order 21 Rule 68 of the CPC is merely a procedural law, which is confirmed by Order 21 Rule 78 of the CPC which provides that an auction-sale concerning a moveable property will not be vitiated due to an irregularity and, thus, it is open to the Judgment-Debtor to institute suit against the person responsible for the irregularity, if any, in conducting the auction-sale provided the Judgment-Debtor has sustained an injury. He contends that, in this case, the Judgment-Debtor will not be able to show that it has sustained an injury owing to such irregularity, because the Judgment-Debtor has been avoiding to pay the decreetal amount in the last 6 (six) years by abusing the process of the Court. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">10.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Mr. Haque lastly submits that in view of the dubious conduct of the Judgment-Debtor in an effort to frustrate the execution of the decree, it is clear that he has not come in clean hands before this Court and, as such, he is not entitled to plea for equitable relief. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">11.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">One day the plaintiff (Judgment-Debtor) having appeared in person in the Court-room was telling so many stories by wailing and lamentation regarding this suit and prayed for not to dispose of the application summarily.

It is the settled law of this jurisdiction that once the auction-sale is confirmed by the executing Court upon being satisfied that the auction-purchaser has complied with the Directions and Orders issued/passed by the executing Court from time to time, including the payment of the consideration money within the stipulated time, then there is no scope for the executing Court to show any sympathy to the Judgment-Debtor even if the Judgment-Debtor pays full decreetal amount together with a further amount of solatium after confirmation of auction-sale. In this case, it is apparent that after confirmation of auction-sale the Judgment-Debtor (plaintiff), having managed the funds, has deposited a Pay Order of the decreetal amount together with a Pay Order for an amount of Tk. 4,59,500/- as solatium vide Pay Order No. 1002200/215 dated 03.02.2019, however, this Court is unable to exercise its discretion at this stage. While it is evident from the record that this suit was dealt with by his previous engaged lawyer in a very cavalier fashion, there is no provision in the law to help the plaintiff at the fag end of the execution of a lawful decree. This Court has taken note of the facts that (i) the original suit was dismissed for default, but the engaged lawyer of that time did not restore the suit within the prescribed time and consequently this plaintiff missed the chance to prove his case by adducing relevant witnesses before the trial Court<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>as to whether the Judgment-Debtor (plaintiff) was<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>responsible for the shortage of delivery or the Jamuna Oil Company (defendant) was liable for the said shortage and (ii) after the suit was dismissed for default, the plaintiff’s engaged lawyer again missed the chance to contest the counter-claim and eventually the original suit was decreed <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">exparte</em>. It is worthwhile to note here that the basis of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">exparte</em> decree is allegation against the plaintiff that he has misappropriated the diesel, but the Hon’ble Appellate Division has not agreed with the said findings, albeit the plaintiff’s appeal was dismissed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: .1pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">13.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Be that as it may, from a minute perusal of the Order sheets, it transpires that when the execution case was kicked off, the Judgment-Debtor (plaintiff) was struggling to manage <span style="letter-spacing: .1pt;">required funds for depositing before the executing Court to meet up the decreetal amount, and for this purpose he was taking time form this Court again and again but ultimately he failed hopelessly.
