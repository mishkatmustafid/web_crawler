The plaintiffs case was that one Hanif Uddin Khondoker was<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">    </span>the C.S. recorded owner of land measuring 10.46 acres who died leaving behind his son Harun Uddin Khondoker who also died leaving behind 5 sons being Rawsan Ali and others. By way of succession and purchase the plaintiffs became owners but in the S.A. and R.S. record the land was recorded in the name of the present petitioner-Government, as such, the suit was filed challenging the publication of record of right which was clouded their entitlement. On the other hand, the present petitioner as the defendant contended that in the C.S. record the suit land was in the private names but during the operation of S.A. record the suit land was diluviated and turned into the river Fuljor and the land remained under water for a long period of time. However, S.A. record of right was published in the name of the than Purba Pakistan province represented by Collector of Pabna (exhibit-Ka) accordingly R.S. record of right was published in the name of Government sometime after 1982 when the suit land was alluviated and R.S. record of right in the name of the present petitioner-Government (exhibit-“Ka-1”), therefore, the present plaintiffs opposite parties do not have any right and title upon the suit land. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">12.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">In view of the above conflicting factual aspects between the parties, this court has to take a legal decision in the case as to the entitlement of the suit land described in the plaint.

There is no dispute that C.S. recorded tenant Hanif Uddin Khondoker and his son Harun Uddin Khondaker was C.S. recorded tenant but the land became subject matter of diluviation around the year of 1956 and the land turned into the river Fuljor and the land remain undered water.

In the instant case the present Government petitioner claimed that the suit land was alluviated around the year of 1982 from river Fuljor, as such, the provision before amendment in the year of 1994 would be applicable which was earlier 20 years for the period of diluvion and alluvion.
