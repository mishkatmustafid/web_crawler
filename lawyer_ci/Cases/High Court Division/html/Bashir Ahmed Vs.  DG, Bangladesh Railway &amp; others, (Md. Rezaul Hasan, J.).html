Apart from that, if is found that, the plaintiff has no title or if he is found to be a trespasser or is found to be land grabber, then he would have no locus-standi to file this suit and thereby to directly or indirectly title in the suit land a building on the suit land to avoid eviction under the Government and (Recovery of Local Authority Recovery of Possession Ordinance), 1970, or as per law. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">16.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">I do not find any merit in this Rule and accordingly, the Rule is liable to be discharged with appropriate direction.</span></span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">O R D E R</span></u></strong></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%; color: #000000;">In the result, the Rule is discharged.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000;">The impugned judgment and order dated 21.03.2016, passed by the Additional District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Chattogram, in Civil Revision No. 44 of 2015, is hereby upheld. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000;">The Trial Court is directed to frame issues, amongst other, (i) as to whether the suit is maintainable in its present form and (ii) as to whether plaintiff has any title in the suit property to let out the same.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000;">The order of stay and status-quo granted earlier by this Court is hereby vacated.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000;">The trial Court is directed to dispose of the suit within soonest possible time.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000;">No costs. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%; color: #000000;"> Let a copy of this judgment be sent to the concerned Courts at once.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 27.0pt; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">Ed.</span></strong></span></p><div style="mso-element: footnote-list;"><span style="color: #000000;"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--></span><br clear="all"/><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/><span style="color: #000000;"> <!--[endif]--> </span><div id="ftn1" style="mso-element: footnote;"><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="file:///H:/article/January__2019(1)/Issue%20__January__19__C.%20R.%201225%20of%2016_Md.%20Rezaul%20Hasan,%20J.%20__11.doc#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" style="color: #000000;" title=""><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Civil Revision No. </span></strong></a><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">1225 of 2016</span></strong></span></p></div></div></div></div>
