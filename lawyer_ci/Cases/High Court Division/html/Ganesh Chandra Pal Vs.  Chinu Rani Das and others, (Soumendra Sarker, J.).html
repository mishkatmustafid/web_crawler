By way of amicable partition among the co-sharers of the case jote the plaintiff use to possess the suit property and at this stage the defendants No.1-3 and 10 in collusion with other defendants behind the back of the plaintiff, showing the plaintiff 2<sup>nd</sup> party and showing the predecessor-in-interest of the defendants-1<sup>st</sup> party created a false, collusive and anti-dated ‘<em>solenama’</em> on 07.10.1966. The further case of the plaintiff is such that without serving any notice upon the 2<sup>nd</sup> party the defendants managed to obtain a collusive service return and thereby in a Mutation Case No.229(9)/1/78-79 they have mutated their names collusively and in fact in that mutation proceedings the plaintiff never obtained any notice. Subsequently, knowing about the mutation order the plaintiff filed an objection which was illegally rejected at the instance of the defendants. It is the contention of the plaintiff that in respect of the suit property in the year 1943 and 1957 there has been two registered ‘<em>solenama’</em> deed among the co-sharers of the suit holding and in pursuant of those ‘<em>solenama</em>’ deeds the co-sharers after getting their separate shaham were possessing their portion of land. The plaintiff-opposite party never executed the ‘<em>solenama</em>’ dated 07.10.1966 and in that ‘<em>solenama</em>’ all the co-sharers were not impleaded parties. One of the sister of plaintiff namely Kusum Bala migrated to India long before 20/21 years of the disputed ‘<em>solenama</em>’ and in that ‘<em>solenama</em>’ the name of Girish Chandra Das was illegal inserted in order to grab a Cinema Hall situated in plot No.9036 and that the ‘<em>solenama</em>’ dated 07.10.1966 was created by the defendants No.1, 3 and 10 in order to deprive the plaintiff. It was also contended in the pleadings of the plaintiff that there was no talk of ‘<em>solenama</em>’ in respect of the land of plot No.9036 in exchange of the land of plot No. 9136 and the plaintiff never surrendered her interest and title of the land appertaining to plot No.9036, but the defendants in order to grab the property in the name of surrender of title and interest in respect of the land of plot No.9036 in lieu of the land of plot No.9136 created the disputed ‘<em>solenama</em>’. The plaintiff knowing about the disputed ‘<em>solenama</em>’ and the mutation in favour of the defendants on 20.12.1979 from the office of the concerned ‘<em>Tahshil’</em> finally came to learn about the misdeed of the defendants which constrained the plaintiff to institute the original suit. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The contrary case of the defendant-respondent-petitioners in short is thus that the property-in-dispute originally belonged to the plaintiff and the defendants in <em>ejmali</em> and subsequently for the sake of peaceful possession to remove the inconvenience among the co-sharers of the suit holding a ‘<em>solenama</em>’ was executed on 07.10.1966 and in that ‘<em>solenama</em>’ the plaintiff put her signature and the said ‘<em>solenama</em>’ has been acted upon after its proper execution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The further case of the defendant-petitioners is such that two ‘<em>solenama</em>’ deed among the co-sharers in respect of their paternal property were made in the year 1943 and 1957, but in fact; those ‘<em>solenama</em>’ were not acted upon. The subsequent ‘<em>solenama</em>’ dated 07.10.1966 was a genuine ‘<em>solenama</em>’ and it was executed properly by the parties to the suit in respect of their paternal property and by this amicable ‘<em>solenama</em>’ in the year 1966 the plaintiff-opposite party give up her interest and title of the land of plot No.9036 in favour of the defendant-petitioners and in exchange of that land the plaintiff obtained ½ of the land in plot No.9136 along with its standing structure. The further case of the defendant-petitioners is such that by the said amicable arrangement pursuant to the ‘<em>solenama</em>’ dated 07.10.1966 the defendants No.1-3 and 7 acquired 16 annas share in the plot No.9036 and thereafter, they constructed a Cinema Hall in front of their dwelling house. Subsequently, they mutated their name after proper service of notice in the office of the concerned Circle Officer (Rev.), Kishoregonj in Mutation Case No. 229(9) /1/1978-79, but the plaintiff out of ill-motive suppressing the facts filed the suit on false allegations.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">During trial of the original suit the learned trial court after taking evidences from the sides of the respective parties dismissed the suit on contest by its judgment and decree dated 26.05.1985. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">5.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Being aggrieved the plaintiff preferred an Other Class Appeal No.260 of 1985 in the court of learned District Judge, Kishoregonj, which was transmitted to the 1<sup>st</sup> Court of learned the then Sub-ordinate Judge, Kishoregonj for hearing and disposal and the learned appellate court on hearing the appeal allowed the same and set aside the judgment and dismissal decree passed by the learned trial court by the impugned judgment and decree dated 07.10.1995.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">6.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and decree the defendant-respondent-petitioners have preferred this revisional application under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained the Rule with an interim order of stay.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">7.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">During hearing of this Rule Mr. A.K.M.

The learned Advocate also submits that there was no material in support of the plaintiff’s contention that the ‘<em>solenama’</em> of the year 1943 and 1957 were acted upon and according to those ‘<em>solenama</em>’ the plaintiff exercised her title and possession in the land. The learned trial court during disposal of the original suit rightly after proper sifting of evidence arrived at a decision that the ‘<em>solenama</em>’ of the year 1943 and 1957 are collusive and not acted upon and thereafter in the year 1966 among the co-sharers of the suit holding for the sake of their possession and interest they executed a ‘<em>solenama</em>’ on 07.10.1966 which was properly executed by the plaintiff and pursuant to that ‘<em>solenama</em>’ the parties to the suit obtained their possession amicably. The learned Advocate submits that the evidence adduced from the sides of the respective parties were not properly evaluated by the learned appellate court and the learned appellate court without rebutting the findings of the trial court adverting evidence on records, reversed the judgment and decree passed by the trial court and at the time of disposal of the appeal there has been misreading and non-reading of evidence and non-consideration of material facts resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice. The learned Advocate referring some decisions submits that the plaintiff during trial of the original suit failed to produce any particular, which was necessary in case of misrepresentation, fraud, breach of trust and undue influence. But the learned appellate court failed to appreciate that, and under Order VI Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure the impugned judgment and decree is bad-in-law. The learned Advocate lastly submits that the original suit as framed was not maintainable as the plaintiff having no legal character and right to sue instituted the original suit, but the learned appellate court failed to realize that and as such, the suit is barred under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">9.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">As against the foresaid submission of the learned Advocate for the petitioners the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the opposite parties opposing the Rule controverted the argument advanced from the side of the petitioners and submits that in passing the impugned judgment and decree the learned appellate court committed no illegality or irregularity. The learned Advocate further submits that, there has been no misreading or non-reading of evidence or non-consideration of material facts resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice by dint of which the impugned judgment and decree can be interfered with. The learned Advocate further submits that under the provisions laid down in Order XLI, Rule 31 of the Code of Civil Procedure the learned court of appeal below after proper assessment of evidence in its true perspective and appreciation of relevant law reversed the findings of the trial court and after rebutting the observation and decision of the learned Munsif, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Kishoregonj adverting evidence on records reversed the judgment and decree passed by the trial court by the impugned judgment and decree. The learned Advocate submits that the specific element of fraud, misrepresentation and undue influence has been well proved from the side of the plaintiff-opposite parties and the particulars were given specifically under Order VI, Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure by the plaintiff-opposite party in her pleadings as well as in the evidence adduced from her side. The learned Advocate argued that, from the cross-examination of the defendant’s witnesses all the particulars of misrepresentation, fraud, breach of trust, willful default and undue influence has been proved and the learned appellate court rightly and properly in his observation and findings pointed out all the particulars and material evidence on the basis of which the judgment and decree was passed by the appellate court and as such there is nothing to interfere with the impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Kishoregonj. The learned Advocate on citation of different decisions of this Court and our Apex Court argued that the elements of fraud which have been mentioned in the plaint in paragraph No.05, has been properly proved by sufficient evidence and there has been clear description as to how the fraud was committed upon the mother of the opposite party No.7, who was the plaintiff to the original suit.

The suit <em>jote</em> which is the paternal property of the parties to the suit admittedly was not partitioned by metes and bounds and it is the case of the plaintiff that in respect of the entire property of the suit <em>jote</em> in the year 1943 and 1957 there were two registered ‘<em>solenama</em>’ deed among the co-sharers of the suit holding and according to those two ‘<em>solenama</em>’ deeds the parties to the suit amicably possessing the property of the suit holding. It has been specifically contended by the plaintiff in the pleadings that in order to deprive her subsequently the defendants No.1, 3 and 10 in collusion with other defendants managed to create a forged ‘<em>solenama</em>’ in the year 1966.
