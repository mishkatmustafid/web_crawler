We have also perused the impugned order. Section 86 of the Co-operative Society Ordinance 1984 provides that any dispute touching the business or affairs of a Co-operative Society or of the liquidator of a Society shall be referred to the Registrar if the parties thereto are amongst the persons specified therein.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> From a reading of this provision of law it appears to us that the expression “dispute attaching the business or affairs of a Co-operative Society of the liquidator of a society” has reference to the normal functioning of the society itself and its relationship with the members of the society and the employees and office-bearers. An agreement for sale or purchase of property by or on behalf of the Society or questions of title and interest involved in any property cannot be matters of adjudication by the Registrar under section 86 of the Act as these are civil disputes amenable to the jurisdiction of the Court. The expression “dispute” compulsorily referable to the Registrar under section 86 of the Co-operative Society Ordinance, 1984 must have a limited meaning and scope and it is never all embracing to cover all kinds of disputes concerning a Co-operative Society. The jurisdiction of the civil Court to try all disputes of Civil nature affecting the rights of the contending parties under section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure cannot be taken away lightly but it can be so read only when it is specifically barred under any law. The question of legality or validity of an agreement for sale of a piece of land involving a Co-operative Society and a third party is, therefore, a matter triable by the civil Court and section 86 of Ordinance is no bar against a suit.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> In the facts of the case, we are of the view that the matters in dispute are exclusively triable by the Civil Court and these are outside the scope of mischief of section 86 of the Co-operative Society Ordinance, 1984. We find no reason to hold that the suit as framed is barred under the law. The learned Subordinate Judge was thus perfectly justified in rejecting the prayer of the petitioner for rejection of the plaint. The impugned order is found to be well-reasoned and well-supported by the materials on record. We find no substance in the application.<br/> <br/>The application is rejected summarily.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
