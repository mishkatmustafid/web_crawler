He has further added that admittedly the defendant made the last repayment on 14.01.1971 to the plaintiff after disbursement of the bridge loan by the predecessors of the plaintiff. He has next added<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>that it is also admitted that the repayment dated 12.01.1989 was made after the suit was filed , on 29.10.1988, and it is also admitted that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>the said repayment was made after, at least, eighteen<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>years after repayment dated 14.01.1971 (Ext. 6(I) of the disbursement of the loan money.

He has next submitted that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>a plain reading makes it<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>crystal clear that payment should be made on account<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>of a debt before<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>expiration of the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>prescribed period, but as the case in hand is concerned , payment<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>was made<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>firstly, after the suit was<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>instituted and secondly, after<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>eighteen years from due and thirdly, in view of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Article-132 (c) of the Limitation Act, after the prescribed period of 12 (twelve) years; Article-132 ( C ) is the specified article<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>for a suit for money only relating to mortgage by deposit of title deed.

He<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>has next added that a plain reading of the unregistered Agreement / contract, namely’ Underwriter-Cum-Advance’ Agreement, reveals that the predecessors of the plaintiff were not mortgagees, rather<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>predecessor of defendant No.7(PICIC) was the mortgagee for the foreign currency loan from earlier without any memorandum of deposit of title deed; while the plaintiff’s predecessors were parties to the said Agreement/Contract as financial institutions who did agree to sanction bridge loan to the defendant of which PICIC, being<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>earlier mortgagee, stood security of the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>future bridge loan. He has further added that the Agreement is not a memorandum of deposit of title deed rather an unregistered Agreement/ Contract and therefore inadmissible in evidence. He has next added that should the Agreement, for arguments sake, is considered to be an admissible ‘memorandum of deposit of title deed’ the expiration of limitation of such mortgage ought to have been read with Article 132 (c) of Limitation Act which provides 12 (twelve) years<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>from the time when the money, sued for, becomes due , as the suit<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>was filed more than 18(eighteen) years after money, sued for, became<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>due the suit is hopelessly barred by limitation.

Rather, the appellant deposited their title deeds with PICIC (from the first set and defendant No.7) to secure the foreign currency loan sanctioned<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>by PICIC, in view of the ‘Agreement’ is, at best, a contemporaneous unregistered contract.

He further added that if the finding, for arguments sake is found to be lawful, yet no decree even under Article-132 (c), not to speak of Article-147, of the Limitations Act is maintainable inasmuch suit must be filed within 12 years.
