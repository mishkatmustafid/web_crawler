More-so, the said ante dated and concocted story has been created only to harass the defendant respondents which clearly evident from the above facts. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">30.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">However, he has further submitted that the plaintiff at the time of creating the manipulated date never thought that the given date of dispossession would clearly proved that it is manipulated and concocted story.

On getting the such news Lutfor Rahman went to the suit house with all documents including the title deeds of the house. While Lutfor Rahman went to the house the Nazrul Islam in the mean time with his accomplice took the driver Abul Kasham with Car on the gun point inside of a narrow pathaway and snatched away all the deeds which was saw by the witness and thereafter informed the Mather to one Golam Mostafa Sub-Inspector of Tahal Police of Dhanmondi Police Station. Later on made a complainant against the Nazrul Islam to the Police Commissioner D.M.P. Dhaka but all the steps were in vain. However, later on Lutfor Rahman Husband of Beauti Rahman on 14.08.2000 lodged an ejhar against Nazrul Islam which was the case No. 20 of Katwali Police Station. The said Nazrul Islam Bhuyain by false personification took the name Masudur Rahman and opened a Bank account showing himself a Masudur Rahman which was proved before the Court at the time of hearing of Non-F.I.R. Case No. 102 of 2000. The said Nazrul Islam failing to capture the suit property hired Md. Azharul Islam hatching conspiracy and filed the instant suit pretending him as Md.

Case No. 102 of 2000 on 13.3.2000 by the order of the Court. So it is crystal clear that the averment of the plaint were totally false. He has further pointed that before dispossession of the defendant Respondents from the suit property by the order of the Court on 13.3.2000 there was a dacoity in the house of the defendant-respondents with the help of the unscrupulous police force of the Dhanmondi Police Station. Though at the time of dacoity the defendants sought help of the police of Dhanmondi Police Station but the police<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>was not<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>active<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>or diligent helping the defendants-respondents though dacoity was committed by the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>miscreants not less than two hours. The news of the dacoity was published in the Daily Ittefaque, Daily Inqilab and other daily news papers by giving specific caption on 14.03.2000. At the time of dacoity the valuable papers of the defendants were looted by the looters. It is curious enough that the plaintiff after events of dacoity and lootings all the papers of the defendants stand as swindler Md. Masudur Rahman and started to claim the suit property as Md. Masudur Rahman however, before that none including the plaintiff claimed that they are the sole proprietor of the suit property. The learned Advocate for the respondents in support of his submissions refers the following exhibits on behalf of the defendants which were marked as Ext. Gha’ and ‘Umo to Uma-2.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">35.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">Mr. Biswas referring exhibits Gha and Uma series the newspapers pointed that the appellant only after occurring the events of dacoity in the suit property came to the scene claiming that he is Md. Azahar Hossain @ Masudur Rahman. However, considering the documentary evidence i.e. Ext.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>13 deed No. 1558 dated 20.6.1991 in the name of Md. Masudur Rahman and seller Haji Helal Uddin Dhali and his wife it is crystal clear that purchaser Masudur Rahman is the son of Ahmed Hossain of 95/C New Elephant Road, Dhanmondi. However, from the plaint it reveals that the plaintiff never used to reside specifically in the suit property or 95/C New Elephant Road at the time of purchase or later on as Masudur Rahman. He did not<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>reside in the address of the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>deed. More-over, it further appears from the documentary evidence and plaint and deposition of the P.W. 1 i.e. the plaintiff is/was resident of 6 Waiseghat and an employee of the office of the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka. However, he never, used or resides on the address of the deed. In the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Ext. 13 deed No. 1558 dated 20.06.1991 purchaser profession was business and father’s name was Ahmed Hossain. But according to school certificate and his official record of the plaintiff it is clearly evident that he is not business man and his father name is/was not Ahmed Hossain rather, his father’s name is Shahjahan Bhuyain and his profession was service. It appears from the deposition and cross-examination of P.W.-1 he has admitted that neither in the school certificate of his children nor his office<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Masudur Rahman is his name. Rather, in his school certificate according to his admission his name is Azaher Hossasin. He has also admitted in cross-examination that he did not take any permission from his superior authority to purchase the property in benami. He has further admitted in his cross-examination that he did not reside in the suit property but allegedly claimed that rented the property to the tenants. He also admitted that defendant-respondents are in possession but claimed as tenant. He has also admitted that in the Birth Registration Certificates of his children the name of the father has not been written Masudur Rahman Bhuiyan. He has also admitted that before the year of 2000 he had purchased some lands, however, in those deeds he did not mention his name as Masudur Rahman Bhuiyan. He has further admitted in his cross-examination that the possession of the suit property was taken by the Officer-in-Charge, Dhanmondi Police Station through non-F.I.R. Case No. 102 of 2000 as receiver from the defendant Nos. 1-4. However, later on he claimed that they were tenants. So, from the above reply in cross it is crystal clear that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>this P.W. 1 i.e. the plaintiff has failed to prove his possession by<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>giving credible<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>testimony and reply in cross. Rather, the testimonies of the plaintiff as PW. 1 is not only inconsistent but full of contradiction and concocted story. Learned Advocate for the respondents has further very candidly argued that the plaintiff to prove his case examined 3 witnesses i.e. (1) the plaintiff himself as PW. No.1 ( 2) Lutfor Rahman as PW. No.2 and (3) Md. Monirul Islam as PW. No. 3. From the testimony of P.W. 1 it appears that in his deposition<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>he has<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>stated<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>his wife is the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>owner of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>shop which is situated 95C New Elephant Road. But in his deposition he did not state that he submitted the deed of that shop showing the title of his wife nor he exhibited the said deed in the Court. Moreover, in his deposition he stated that he had married with one Sabina Yeasmin (Rakiba) on 7.3.1980 at the time of marriage he mentioned his name in kabinnama Md. Azaher Hossain (Masud) and father’s name Ahmed Hossain (Shahjahan). The learned Advocate referred the kabinnama Ext. 2 and pointed that the copy of the kabinnama neither certified nor original one. More-so, the plaintiff to prove the Kabinnama did not call for any attesting witness nor he produced his wife as a witness to prove the Ext. 2. So, this exhibit is nothing but a concocted and manufactured one, hence, the same has been created purposely only to use in the case. He has further argued that some certificates were produced which were marked as exhibit 3 and 4 to prove those certificate the plaintiff neither adduced any attesting witness or call for issuing authority. More-so he argued that the issuance authority as has been shown in those 2 exhibits i.e. 3 and 4 they have no legal and lawful authority to issue any such certificates without verification the actual name in violation of the law of the Birth Registration, school certificate and the official record of his public service and, as such, those certificates are nothing but manipulated and concocted piece of papers, however, have been created only for the purpose of the case. He has further argued that the plaintiff rather by giving those created and anti-dated papers proved that those have only been created for the purpose of the case<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>after filing the suit. The learned Advocate for the respondents<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>referring<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>exhibit 6 has argued that Natarial certificate and affidavit before the Notary Public has been created showing<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>date 28.8.1989 declaring that his actual name is Md. Azhar Hossain and nick name is Md. Masudur Rahman however, from the Ext. 13 deed No. 1558 dated<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>28.6.1991 it is crystal clear that the affidavit exhibit -6 has been created purposely giving ante date because if the exhibit 6 had actually been done on 28.08.1989 declaring his name Md. Azhar Hossain and nick name is Md. Masudur Rahman then later on in the exhibit 13 dated 28.06.1991 the plaintiff surely used his actual name Md. Azhar Hossain with nick name Md. Masudur Rahman. He has further referring the exhibit-1 argued that the contents of the affidavit has not been proved by the plaintiff. He fortifying his argument said that the exhibit has not been proved by the deponent who made it although deponent is none but the father of the plaintiff. So it has no evidential value. So, it is depicted from the Ext. 1,2,3,4 and 6 that those exhibits were created after thought by giving ante-date creating and inserting false name<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Masudur Rahman in those exhibits.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">36.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">The learned Advocate for the respondents has further pointed that it is admitted by the plaintiff that he is an employee of the office of the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka. So, there is a serious question of doubt why he went to make an affidavit before the Notary Public and before the Magistrate of the Metropolitan Court, Dhaka as there are so many First Class Magistrate in the office of the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka for doing the same. More-so the plaintiff did not adduce any attesting witness i.e. the learned Advocate who identified him &amp; his father and who solemnized both the affidavits. So, these exhibits neither bear any legal effect nor have any evidential value. He has further pointed that Ext. Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 submitted by the plaintiff in the Court do not prove that he got those documents from the vendors and from the proper custody and possession rather, it is clear case of the defendants that while defendants was in the possession of the suit property all those papers were in their possession and those had been looted and snatched away by the Nazrul Islam and his accomplice. Thereafter, the plaintiffs with connivance of the Nazrul Islam obtained those papers and started claiming the ownership showing himself as swindler Masudur Rahman after filing non F.I .R. Case No. 102 of 2000. He has further added that if the plaintiffs purchased the suit property surely his actual certificate name and father’s name would have been written in the title deeds. Even if, for the argument shake if it is said that he had purchased the suit property in benami in that case he must produce the man in whose name he purchased the suit property. So, such type of claim is not sustainable in the eye of law. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">37.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">Mr. Biswas very candidly submitted that another vital aspect of the case is that the defendants Nos. 5 and 6 filed the written statement, however, they did not contest in the suit, even, they were not adduced as witness although defendant No. 6 is alive. On the other hand the PW. No. 3 claimed to be a son of the defendants No. 5 &amp; 6 but he without contesting in the suit as the heirs of the defendant No. 5 &amp; 6 allegedly as son of them deposed in the Court as a witness of the plaintiff which is not only contrary to the settle maxim of law but superfluous and imaginary exercise of a witness supporting another’s case while the said witness himself has a legal right and status to contest in the case but he waiving the such right and status stand for other which caused serious doubt about his character as well as his identity. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">38.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">Mr. Biswas has further added that the learned Advocate for the appellant argued that the defendants did not produce the original deeds of them, rather, produce they certified copies of the same and, as such, without proving the same by giving any proper evidence the secondary evidence can not be proved and the same has no evidential value nor they are relieved from proving the same by giving proper evidence. In reply of the said argument of the learned Advocate for the appellant, Mr. Biswas referred the testimony of the D.W. No. 4 Kazi Azizul Haque and argued that from the deposition of the said witness this point would be clear. The D.W. No. 4 in his deposition stated that “ he was the Manager of the City Bank, Islampur Branch. The original deed No. 1352 dated 17.04.2000 was deposited in the said Bank as mortgage deed. The said deed was seized by the Police Inspector of C.I.D in connection with Tejgaon Police Station Case No. 61(9) 2000. Now said deed is not lying with Bank. In reply of cross by the plaintiff he stated that the said deed was deposited by the Shamsul Alam and others. He also deposited the Photocopy of the seizure list of the case.” </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">39.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">Mr. Biswas quoting the deposition further fortified his argument and submitted that from the above deposition and cross examination of D.W. No.4 it is evident that the arguments put forwarded by the learned Advocate not tenable in the eye of law, rather, the story of the defence is genuine and more believable. So, according to him there is genuine explanation why the defendants produced the certified copy of their exhibits. He has further pointed that the other original deeds are on record on the exceptional way for which the defendants made out a clear case against the plaintiff that he with the connivance of Md. Nazrul Islam Bhuyain captured the said deeds from the possession of the defendants but that onus never disproved by the plaintiff. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">40.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">Mr. Biswas has further raised the question of identity of the plaintiff referring his deposition and exhibits and cross examination and argued that the trial Court rightly found that he is not Md.

It is the plaintiff who claimed that he is Md. Azhar Hossain alias Md.

Khatian of the suit property was published in the name of Md. Faizullah Bhuyain. Md. Faizullah on 11.10.1963 transferred the suit land to Nabab Ali Sardar. On 27.01.1978 Newab Ali transferred the suit land to Helal Uddin and Kanchan Nahar. They got mutated their name and paid the rent. Helal Uddin obtained Rajuk Plan. Thereafter, on 20.06.1991 Helal Uddin and his wife sold the suit property vide No. 1558 and handed over the possession of the suit property to the plaintiff. Original papers were handed over to him. He possessed the suit property through caretaker Nazrul Islam. He betrayed with him and collected the rent from the tenant as Masudur Rahman. Nazrul Islasm lodged cases being Dhanmandi Police Station Case No. 35(3) 2000 and 39(3) 2000. Therefore, created forged deed and tried to take possession of the suit property. The Officer-in-Charge, Dhanmandhi Police Station on 13.3.2000 made a General Diary being No.747. Thereafter, started Non FIR case No. 102 of 2000. The officer in charge of the Dhanmandi Police Station proceeded with a proceeding under section 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and prayed for appointment of receiver. On 17.03.2000 Mr. Meraz Hossain Metropolitan Magistrate passed the order of attachment until further order. He was added party in the case and prayed for release of the property in his favor. Shahjahan and others also prayed for added party in the case. On 10.08.2001 Magistrate erroneously passed the order of release of the property in favor of the defendants. He preferred the revision No. 344 of 2001 against that order. The revisional Court set aside the order of the Magistrate Court and ordered to continue the receivership until decision of the title. Against that order Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 5467 of 2001 was preferred to the Hon’ble High Court Division. Appeal was allowed and judgment of the Additional Sessions Judge was set aside.

So, it is not helpful to discard the dispute regarding the name and intentity of the plaintiff. Rather, it is revealed that the P.W.2 Lutfur Rahman contradicted his testimonies in cross examination. In reply of cross he stated that he could not recollect in which sub registry office the deed was registered. He could not say in which date deed was typed. He has read the deed. The profession of the plaintiff is business has been written in the deed. In deed the name Azahar Hossain not mentioned, however, there is Masudur Rahman. The vendor Helal Uddin is the cousin. He is no longer alive but his wife Kanchan Nahar is alive. He has deposed before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court in respect of the house. He has gone to the Registrar Office at the time of Registration. He knows the purchaser before 4/5 days of the registration of the deed. However, he could not say who claimed the suit land by dint of the exhibition 13 if he is the clerk of Deputy Commissioner Office. The purchaser name is Masudur Rahman. He learned from the plaintiff that his name is Azahar Hossain Bhuyain. He could not recollect whether he stated in his deposition in the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate that the Masudur Rahman has another name Azhar Hossain. The defense suggestion were denied by him stating that not a fact that he has identified the plaintiff as Masudur Rahman as being gained over, not a fact that he was not present in Registry Office, not a fact that he has not seen the Masudur Rahman, not a fact that the plaintiff to grab the suit house pretend as being Masudur Rahman, not a fact that he has stated falsely. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">76.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">Considering the deposition and reply of cross examination we could not hold that those testimonies are apparently favored the plaintiff case.

However, in this aspect it is very pertinent that the Helal Uddin no more but the Kanchan Nahar is alive. It is also asserted by Mr. Dutta that said Kanchan Nahar filed the written statement supporting the pleading of the plaintiff. So, very pertinent question is why the prosecution withheld such absolutely necessary person to support his plaint case or why instead of Kanchan Nahar to prove the identity of the plaintiff as Azahar Hossain alias Masudur Rahman produce his brother-in-law and son P.W. 3. So, we are of the view that if Kanchan Nahar would have come before the Court the presence of the P.W.

Masudur Rahman, son of Ahammod Hossain, 95/C, New Elephant Road, Dhanmondi, Dhaka, profession business however, Exhibit-6 dated 20.08.1989 made by the plaintiff declaring the name of his as Md. Azaher Hossain @ Md. Masudur Rahman, son of Ahmed Hossain @ Md. Shahjahan Bhuiyan from this 2 (two) Exhibits it is clearly depicted that the name and father’s name of the sole purchaser of the sale deed dated 20.6.1991 (Exhibit-13) and name and father’s name of the Exhibit-1 and 6 as declared by the deponents in the affidavits are not same and identical. There is a clear distinction that in the Exhibit-13 purchaser name is Md. Masudur Rahman, son of Ahmed Hossain and it is divulged from Exhibit-1 name of the deponent Md. Shahjahan Bhuiyan @ Ahmed Hossain Bhuiyan and his son name is Md. Azaher Hossain Bhuiyan @ Masudur Rahman and in exhibit 6 dated 20.08.1989 the plaintiff name is Md. Azahar Hossain alias Md. Masudur Rahman. So, the plaintiff by exhibiting Exhibit-1 and 6 were not able to prove that Md. Masudur Rahman as of Ext. 13 is the same person which has been stated in the Exhibit-1 and 6 as Md. Azaher Hossain Bhuiyan @ Masudur Rahman, the reasons is that the Exhibit-13 was registered earlier point of time on 20.06.1991 and Exhibit-1 made on 20.07.2002 later on but Ext. 6 made on more earlier on 20.08.1989. So, if the plaintiff is the purchaser of Exhibit-13 then surely at the time of making, declaring and sworn in the Exhibit-1 his father name must mentioned as per the deed, not only that when plaintiff claimed that he himself made an affidavit on 20.08.1989 then why later on at the time of registering the Exhibit -13 dated 20.06.1991 changed his name, father name, address and profession. There is no reply in any where of the plaint and his deposition. In the affidavit Exhibit No. 1 and in the Exhibit-13 the deponent could have given statement specifying the deed No. and others transactions wherein his son name were mentioned as Md. Masudur Rahman instead of Md. Azaher Hossain Bhuiyan @ Masudur Rahman. More-so, on perusal of the Exhibit-1 it appears that the deponent is none but the father of the plaintiff who in the affidavit neither mentioned the profession of his son nor given the address which has been used in the Exhibit-13 dated 20.6.1991.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">80.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">On perusal of the Exhibit-2 which is the alleged registered Kabinnama of the plaintiff where in the name of the plaintiff Md.

Shahjahan Bhuiyan @ Ahmed Hossain Bhuiyan and again Ahmed Hossain alias Md. Shahjahan Bhuiyan respectively. However, in the Exhibit-13 name of the purchaser Md. Masudur Rahman son of Ahmed Hossain. So, it is very much clear that in the Exhibits 1, 2 and 6 the name of the plaintiff nowhere likes Exhibit-13 Md.

The plaintiff was not able to prove by producing Exhibits 1, 2 and 6 to dismal situation and such variances.

Thereafter, the plaintiff came into scene of action claiming the property for the first time during the pendency of the none F.I.R. Case No. 102 of 2000. However, the plaintiff has denied those facts in the form of denial at the time of deposition. So, we have to discuss about the possession and custody of the Exhibits 8-12 as both the party made contradictory statement at the time of their deposition. The P.W. No.1 Md. Azaher Hossain Hossain @ Masudur Rahman @ Masud Bhuiyan submitted the exhibits before the Court, however, in the cross it has been suggested that Exhibits 8,10,11,12 had gone in his hand after the dacoity in the suit property. However, he denied the suggestion, to come in a just proper and appropriate decision we thought that the deposition of P.W. 2 and 3 would be helpful to find out the actual facts but the averment of the plaint may be looked into about the statement of the plaintiff regarding handing over of the those<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Exhibits. Therefore, we meticulously perused the averment of the plaint and deposition of P.W.2 and 3. It appears from the statement of paragraph-5 that the plaintiff claimed those exhibits were in his hand at the time of filing of the suits albeit it was not in the 1<sup>st</sup> plaint when the suit was filed. However, the deposition of P.W.2 and 3 do not support the facts that those documents were handed over to the plaintiff at the time of registration of the deed or thereafter at any point of time. We find another history from the cross examination of P.W.2 that the vendors of the Masudur Rahman, Helal Uddin Dhali, died but his wife Kanchon Nahar is alive but the plaintiff did not examined nor the Kanchon Nahar herself came to support her written statement as witness or Court witness to prove averment of the paragraph 5 of the plaint regarding possession, control and handing over of the exhibits-8-12. From the above facts and circumstances we can not hold but surely doubt about the proper possession and control of the above exhibits 8-12 in favour of the plaintiff. Because the plaintiff withheld the vital and only alive vendor to produce in the Court. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">85.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">P.W.

He further admitted that he could not say in which date he was dispossess in the year-2000. He further admitted in the plaint that he could not say that defendant Nos. 1-4 dispossess him in the year-2000. He further admitted that he filed the Miscellaneous Case being No. 36 of 2002 for canceling of the mutation of the defendants. He further admitted that by dint of the above Miscellaneous Case there was a physical investigation regarding the possession. In the report of the physical investigation the Kanungo did not say the plaintiff was in possession at any time, however, he protested that the report was not correct, further admitting that he did not file any case against the report of the Kanungo.

In this regard the plaintiff’s explanation is not only necessary but very much pertinent because in cross the plaintiff himself as P.W. No.1 admitted that he does not know any of the tenants.

It appears from those Exhibit that he filed the income tax returns for those year without showing the income of the house and without payment any tax. Wherein he had written his name Masudur Rahman @ Azahar Hossain. The Assessing Officer fixed the income as per statement showing zero tax. However, it is pertinent to mention here that the plaintiff did not show any living cost instead of that he has stated in Income Tax return form that he has been living in the village home as per order of assessee Officer. He has however, stated in his Income Tax return that he has been living in the suit plot i.e. 150 Criscent Road, Dhanmondi. Now, question is which statement is correct. In such peculiar situation it must be held that both the statement are false and fabricated. Besides these, how the exhibit 20 series would be believable in the Court of law wherein the plaintiffs himself as P.W.No.1 admitted in the cross that he never resides in the 150 Criscent Road, which is the suit plot. The plaintiff at the time of deposition has written his address 6, Wiseghat, Kotowali, Dhaka on 05.02.2008. Whereas exhibit 20 and 20(1) the income tax returns 2007-2008 used his residence as 150, Criscent Road, Dhanmondi.

From exhibit ‘Niya’, ‘Niya(1)’ the order of the Assistant Commissioner and physical possession Report of Kanungo of Dhanmondi Circle it is clear that the plaintiff was not in possession of suit property.
