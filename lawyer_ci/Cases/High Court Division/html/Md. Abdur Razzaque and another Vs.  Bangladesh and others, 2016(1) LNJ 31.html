The petitioner was regularized as per provision of the Rules, 2000 and hence he was regularized in accordance with law. The petitioners cannot challenge the regularization as per provision the Rules of 1981 since the said Rule has been repealed and the Rules, 2000 was given effect from 1978 and the petitioners services also fall under the Rules, 2000. The absorption rules was made effective from 01.02.1978 and as per Rule 9(1) of the said Rules the Absorption Rules 1998 was cancelled. He also submits that Absorption Rules, 2000 clearly stipulates that the petitioner shall be regularized from date of their regularization and their service shall be counted from the date of their regularization therefore, the petitioner cannot claim the benefit of Rules, 1981, as such, the Rule is liable to be discharged.<br/><br/>In Writ Petition No. 2330 of 2014, the respondent No. 5 filed an Affidavit in Opposition wherein it is stated that the posts of the petitioners were created as per Absorption Rules, 2000 since the college was nationalized after 2000 and as such provisions of Absorption Rules, 2000 shall be applicable for them, as such, the Rule should be discharged.<br/><br/>It is further stated that regularization of the petitioners were made as per correct provisions of law. There is no reason that the petitioners services shall be regularized as per Absorption Rules, 1981 since they were never within the ambit of Absorption Rules, 1981 which is applicable for the teachers and staffs whose colleges were nationalized before 1998, when 1998 Rules came into effect replacing 1981 Rules.<br/><br/>Mr. Goutam Kumar Roy, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing along with Mr. Md. Yunus the learned Assistant Attorney General submits that these two Writ Petitions have been filed by the petitioners challenging the provision of Rule 6(5) of the Absorption Rules, 2000 being virus of the Constitution of Bangladesh and also seeking a direction for regularizing the petitioners’ services from the date of ad hoc appointment in the respective petitioners but the Rule 6(5) of the Absorption Rules, 2000 is clearly provided that a Lecturer in a nationalized college could only be entitled on regularization of his/her service but not from the date of appointment on ad-hoc basis, as such, these Rules merit no consideration from this court as these are beyond the requirement of the existing law, as such, the Rule should be discharged. The learned Deputy Attorney General further submits that the petitioners were regularized by the respondents after a proper scrutiny of the individual petitioners service record and performance but the petitioners claim of regularization from the date of ad-hoc appointment have no legal basis, therefore, these Rules are liable to be discharged.<br/><br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General further submits that the petitioners have been regularized by the orders passed by the respondent No. 1, as such, the petitioners are the servants of the republic, therefore, they cannot invoke the jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution because the petitioners have efficacious remedy under Article 117 of the Constitution for pursuing the matter before the Administrative Tribunal thus these Rules are not maintainable under the provision of existing law of the country, as such, he prays to discharge the Rule.<br/><br/>Considering the above submissions made by the learned Advocates appearing for the respective parties and also considering the Writ Petitions (Writ Petition No. 10075 of 2011 and Writ Petition No. 3230 of 2014) along with Annexures therein, and also considering the Affidavit-in-Oppositions filed by the respondent No. 5, it appears to us that the Petitioner Md. Abdur Razzaque in the Writ Petition No. 10075 of 2011 was appointed in Non-government College, namely, Mosheshpur Mohila Degree College, Kushtia on 01.09.1986 as a Lecturer in the subject of Chemistry. The said College was nationalized from the date of 15.12.1992 by an order passed on 10.07.1994. The petitioner thereafter was appointed as the Lecturer from the date of 22.12.1995 by an order dated 22.01.1995 on an ad-hoc basis. The petitioner service was regularized by the respondent No. 1 on 16.03.2003 after a required recommendation of the Public Servant Commission (PSC).<br/><br/>In this Writ Petition the questions are what should be operating law as per the petitioner is concerned and also whether the order of regularization of the petitioner service after nearly a period of 9 years i.e. the petitioner was appointed on ad-hoc basis with effect from 22.12.1994 but the petitioner service was regularized on 16.03.2003 under the provision of Rule 9(5) of the Absorption Rules, 2000.<br/> <br/>To answer the above two questions we have examined the relevant laws under the Teachers and Non-Teaching Staff of Nationalized College (Directorate of Public Instruction) Absorption Rules, 1981 as well as the provision of Rule 6(5) of the Absorption Rules, 2000 to be affective from 01.02.1978. From the above given facts it is clear that the petitioner was appointed on the ad-hoc basis with effect from 22.12.1994 and the operating law at that moment of time was the Absorption Rule 1981. In this regard we have to consider the provision under Rules 3,4 and 5 of the Absorption Rules, 1981 which reads as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“3. Ad-hoc appointment of a teacher :(1) a Teacher of a nationalized college shall, subject to the fulfillment of the condition or rule 5, be appointed on ad-hoc basis as a Lecturer or Assistant Professor under the Directorate of Public Instruction.<br/><br/>Provided that no teacher shall be appointed on ad-hoc basis as an Assistant Professor unless he has at least a Second Class Master’s degree in the relevant subject and has at least 7 years of effective service.<br/><br/>2. A Lecturer or Assistant Professor appointed on ad-hoc basis shall be entitled to such pay and allowances in their respective seals of pay as may be determined by the Government.<br/><br/>4. Regularization of ad-hoc teachers:- (1) A teacher appointed on ad-hoc basis under rule 3 shall be appointed on regular basis through the Commission either by interview or otherwise as may decided by the Commission.<br/><br/>(2). No teacher shall be eligible for regular appointment as Lecturer unless he has at least Second Class Master’s degree in the relevant subject:<br/><br/>Provided that the Commission may recommend a teacher having Third Class Master’s Degree in the relevant subject for regular appointment on his obtaining at least Second Class Master’s degree in the relevant subject within a period of 3 years from the date of communication of such recommendation to the teacher, failing which his ad-hoc appointment shall be terminated by the appointing authority.<br/><br/>5. Eligibility : (1) No person shall be eligible for appointment under those rules if he-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">a) is not a citizen of Bangladesh or a permanent resident of Bangladesh; and<br/>b) is married to, or has entered into a promise of marriage with, person who is not a citizen of Bangladesh.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(2) No regular appointment shall be made under these rules unless-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">(a) a person selected for appointment by the Commission is declared by a Medical Board or a Medical Officer set up or, as the case may be, authorized by the Director of Health Services to be medically fit for such appointment, and<br/>(b) the antecedents of the person so selected have been verified through appropriate agency and found to be such as do not render him unsuitable for appointment in the services of the Republic.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>As per the above provisions of the Rules, 1981 the petitioner can only be appointed on ad-hoc basis in the year of 1994 under the prevailing law which was the Absorption Rules 1981. Despite the fact the petitioner was regularized on 16.03.2003, therefore, we can take a decision that the operating law in the case of the present petitioner shall be the laws prevailing on the date of his appointment on ad-hoc basis. In this regard Rule 3 of the Absorption Rules, 1981 provides appointment on ad-hoc basis in a nationalized college subject to fulfillment of the conditions of Rule 5 mentioned above. It is clear to us that the petitioners were appointed under the provision of Rule 3 along with Rule 5 which was the final appointment and the operating law was the Absorption Rules, 1981.<br/> <br/>In writ petition No. 10075 of 2011 the respondent issued an office order dated 22.01.1995 (Annexure E) appointing the petitioner, Md. Abdur Razzak at serial No. 20 and also containing the process of regularizing in the following terms:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“মে­হরপুর জেলার মে­হরপুর সরকারী মহিলা ক­লজ­ক জাতীয়করন করার প্রেক্ষি­ত উও্র ক­ল­জ কর্মরত বেসরকারী আম­লর নিন্মলিখিত শিক্ষকবৃন্দকে জাতীয়কৃত ক­ল­জর শিক্ষক ও অশিক্ষক কর্মচারী আত্তীকরণ বিধিমালা-১৯৮১ অনুসা­র পদ সৃষ্টির আ­দশ জারীর তারিখ ২২/১২/৯৪ইং হই­ত তাহা­দর না­মর পা­র্শ্ব বর্নিত বিষয় ও প­দ এড-হক ভিত্তি­ত নি­য়াগ করা হইলঃ-<br/> </div><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="height:913px;

We, therefore, sought assistance from the learned Deputy Attorney General as to the delay for 9 years in regularizing the petitioner, here again, the learned Deputy Attorney General could not provide us with any explanation for such a long period of time which is nearly 9 years. We have expressed our anxiety over the conduct of the respondents in handling of this petitioner’s case with utter carelessness and arbitrary. We also consider that the conduct on the part of the respondents made the petitioner a victim. Despite the provision of law under the Absorption Rule, 1981 which clearly mentioned that a teacher shall be appointed on an ad-hoc basis in a nationalized college if and only if he or she can satisfy Rule 5 when he/she is eligible to be appointed as a teacher. In the instant case the petitioner has satisfied all requirements to become eligible to get appointment in the post of lecturer in the year of 1994, therefore, the petitioner service should be considered from the date of ad-hoc appointment with effect from 22.12.1994 pursuant to the order dated 22.01.1991(Annexure-E of the Writ Petition) under the provision of the Absorption Rules, 1981.<br/> <br/>Regarding the Writ Petition No. 3230 of 2014 the petitioners (20 in numbers) were originally appointed in the Mosheshpur Degree College in Jeinaidah by the order around the period of 1985 to 2003 as the Lecturers. After complying all the required academic qualification and other requirements for such appointment in the said Non-government/ Private College in the year of 2005.The said college was nationalized with effect from 10.07.2004 and the name of the College has been recorded as the Moheshpur Government Degree College. Regarding the appointment of the petitioners and all other teachers and non-teaching staffs the Government passed several orders including order for creating posts for Lecturer, Assistant Professor and other Teachers along with the Staffs for the Government Colleges. In course of time after creating posts in the aforesaid manner the petitioners were appointed on the ad-hoc basis by the notification dated 14.09.2006 (Annexure –G of the Writ Petition No. 3230 of 2014) also contains the provision of regularizations of their service under Rules, 2000 (come into effect 01.02.1978) which reads as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify;

It should be mentioned here that Annexure-G of the writ petition has been passed in order to comply with the Rule 5 of the Absorption Rules, 2000 come into effect on 01 February, 1978 which reads as follows:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“৫। এডহক নি­য়া­গ বাধা-নি­ষধঃ- কোন ব্যক্তি এই বিধিমালার অধীন এডহক নি­য়া­গর জন্য যোগ্য হই­বন না, যদি-<br/>(ক) তিনি বাংলা­দ­শর নাগরিক অথবা স্থায়ী বাসিন্ধা না, হন;<br/>(খ) তিনি বাংলা­দ­শর নাগরিক ন­হন এমন কোন ব্যক্তিকে বিবাহ করিয়া থা­কন অথবা বিবাহ করিবার জন্য প্রতিশ্র্রতিবদ্ধ হইয়া থা­কন;<br/>(গ) স্বাস্থ্য অধিদপ্তরের মহাপরিচালক কর্তৃক এতদু­দ্দ্য­শ্য গঠিত মেডিক্যাল বোর্ড অথবা তাহার নিকট হই­ত ক্ষমতাপ্রাপ্ত কোন মেডিক্যাল অফিসার সংশ্লিষ্ট প­দর জন্য তাহা­ক স্বাসহ্যগতভা­ব যোগ্য বলিয়া প্রত্যায়ন না ক­রন;<br/>(ঘ) যথা­যাগ্য কর্তৃপ­ক্ষর বা সংসহা কর্তৃক উও্র ব্যও্রির পূর্ব কার্যকলাপ তদ­ন্তের ফ­ল দেখা যায় যে, তিনি প্রজাতন্ত্রের চাকুরী­ত নি­য়োগের অ­যোগ্য;<br/>(ঙ) এডহক নি­য়া­গর তারি­খ তাহার বয়স সরকারী কর্মচারী অবসর গ্রহ­নর বয়­স বেশী হয়"<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">We have carefully considered the above administrative order and the provisions under the Rules, 2000 which lead us to consider that a Lecturer appointed in a private Non-government College can be a Government Employee as a Lecturer on transferring the College in a Nationalized Government College. We also consider the context in which this provision was introduced by the People’s Republic of Bangladesh under the provision of Articles 133 and 140(2) of the Constitution of Bangladesh by consultation with the Public Service Commission and the whole Absorption Rules is to adjust or absorb teachers from the Non-government College/School into the Government College/School. Rule 5 of the Rules, 2000 came into effect on 01.02.1997, according to us, provides the processes for first scanning for including the Non-government teachers into Government-teachers subject to the recommendation of the Public Service Commission in order to make the new absorbed teachers or Lecturers to be included into the cadre service as the government employees. As part of the said scanning process a candidate either as a Lecturer or as a staff has to satisfy the 5 requirements under the said Rule 5 including character, conduct health condition, marital status and the age of retirement. In the instant case the petitioners were appointed on the ad-hoc basis after fulfilling the above requirement of law.<br/> <br/>The 2<sup>nd</sup> form of scanning of a teacher and non-teaching staff under the provision laid down in Rule 6 of the Absorption Rule 2000 which reads as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“৬। চাকুরী নিয়মিতকরণ ইত্যাদিঃ (১) Bangladesh Public Service Commission (Constitution) Regulations, 1979 এবং প্র­যাজ্য অন্যান্য আইন অনুসা­র কমিশ­নর আওতাভুক্ত প­দ, কমিশ­নর সুপারিশ ব্যতীত, নি­য়াগকারী কর্তৃপক্ষ কোন এডহক নি­য়াগ নিয়মিত করি­ব না।<br/>(২) এডহকভিত্তি­ত নি­য়াগপ্রাপ্ত ব্যক্তির প্র­য়োজনীয় যোগ্যতা থাকি­ল এবং তাহার এডহক নি­য়াগ পরবর্তী চাকুরীকাল স­ন্তোষজনক হই­ল কমিশন উহার সুপারিশ প্রদান করি­বে।<br/>(৩) কমিশন­নর আওতাবহির্ভূত প­দ এডহক নি­য়াগ প্র­য়াজনীয় যোগ্যতারভিত্তি­ত নি­য়াগকারী কর্তৃপক্ষ নিয়মিত করি­বে।<br/>(৪) কোন ব্যক্তির এডহক নি­য়াগ নিয়মিত করা না হই­ল তিনি নি­য়াগকারী কর্তৃপ­ক্ষর সিদ্ধান্ত অনুসা­রে আর চাকুরী­ত বহাল থাকি­বনা, ত­ব প্র­য়াজনীয় যোগ্যতা থাকি­ল এডহকভিত্তি­ত নি­য়াজিত শিক্ষক­ক সরকার ক্যাডারবহির্ভূত প্রভাষক প­দ নি­য়াজিত রাখি­ত পারি­ব এবং তাহার চাকুরীর শর্তাবলী সরকার কর্তৃক নির্ধারিত হই­ব।<br/>(৫) এই বিধি অনুসা­র কোন ব্যও্রির এডহক নি­য়াগ নিয়মিত করা হই­ল সংশ্লিষ্ট প­দ তাহার আত্মীকরণ সম্পন্ন হই­ব এবং শিক্ষ­কর ক্ষে­ত্র নিয়মিতকর­ণর আ­দশ প্রদা­নর তারি­খ তিনি ক্যাডারভূক্ত হইয়া­ছন বলিয়া গন্য হই­বন। ”    </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Having qualified under the Rule 5 the petitioners became subject to scanning under the above provision, in particular, Rule 6(1) which contains that no teacher can be appointed on ad-hoc basis or can be regularized without an approval or of recommendation from the Public Service Commission under the provision of Public Service Commission (consultation) Regulation, 1979. From Annexure-H of the writ petition mentioned above contains the approval /recommendation in favour of the present petitioners to be appointed and regularized in their respective posts as Lecturers. Rule 6(5) of the Absorption Rules at the same time contained that a person absorption process would be completed after being appointed on ad-hoc basis and also after being regularized and, if those are satisfied, a teacher can be encadred on regularizing his service. In the above provision of Rule 5, Rule 6(1) and Rule 6(5) of this law require encadrement of a teacher after the absorption in his post on regularizing his post.<br/> <br/>Now, the question is when a teacher should be considered as absorbed in his post under the provision of Absorption Rules 2000. To answer the said question we have carefully examined Rules 5, 6 and 7 of the Absorption Rules, 2000 and we have to read all these Rules together in order to interpret the law which have created on the foundation to give benefit of the educational system as a whole by providing teachers and non-teaching staffs of a Non-government Private College converting into a Government College. The whole purpose is to enhance the standard and facilities of the teaching thousands of students to get their best education process. In this regard we should mention that government has introduced Rules, 2000 but given effect from 1978 not to remove or discard a teacher or Lecturer from a Non-government Private College but to include them inasmuch as a College required. These two Rules were issued challenging the legality of Rule 6(5) of the Absorption Rules, 2000 as being virus to the Constitution of Bangladesh but during the hearing of this Rule, the learned Advocates appearing for the petitioners expressed their desire not to press this part of the Rule but to given emphasis upon their submissions on seeking a direction to regularize the service of the petitioners with all service benefits from the date of their appointment on ad-hoc basis from 03.07.2006. Regarding the 2<sup>nd</sup> portion of the Rule issued by this court in Writ Petition we consider that the petitioners were given appointment on the ad-hoc basis with effect from 03.07.2006 by order dated 14.09.2006 and the petitioners have been providing their services in the College as the Lecturers and or Assistant Professors on the basis of the aforementioned appointment by the Annexure-G dated 14.09.2006 which contains that the petitioners will be regularized as soon as their appointment would be recommended by the Public Service Commission as per required Rule 6(1) of the Absorption Rules, 2000 which is in operation from 01.02.1978. It appears from the record that the petitioners appointment were recommended by the PSC on 19.02.2009 containing in Annexure-E of the Writ Petition. When the aforesaid two steps have been taken by the respondents including the respondent No. 1 in respect of the services of the petitioners the question naturally arises why the respondents have to be waited for regularizing the petitioners appointment until on 24.10.2013 which is 7 years after the ad-hoc appointment and 4 years from the required recommendation by the PSC. In this regard we sought submissions from the learned Advocates appearing for the respective parties. In response to our queries the learned Advocates for the petitioners stated that the concerned official even after knowing the required laws as mentioned above as appointment of the petitioners delayed their response in order to cause suffering to the petitioners which can be termed as malice in law. In the case of on English jurisdiction Viscount Haldane L.C in the case of Sharer v Shiehad (1914) Ac. 808 and in the case of Bangladesh jurisdiction Dr. Nazrul Islam V Bangladesh 1981 BLD (AD) 140 the phrase of Malice in Law have been described in the following terms:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Between the malice in fact and malice in law there is a broad distinction which is not peculiar to any particular system of jurisprudence. A person who inflicts an injury upon another person in contravention of the law is not allowed to say that he did so with an innocent mind; he is taken to know the law, and he must act within the law. He may, therefore, be guilty of malice in law, although so far as the state of his mid is concerned, he acts ignorantly, and in that sense innocently. Malice of fact is quite an ignorantly, and in that sense innocently. Malice of fact if quite a different thing; it means a actual malicious intention on the part of the person who has done the wrongful act, and it may be in proceedings based on wrongs independent of contract, a very material ingredient in the question whether a valid case of actions can be stated. ”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>When question of malice in law arises this court can consider a writ petition even the petitioner are in the service of the Republic. In reply to our queries the learned Assistant Attorney General simply said that the government officials take decision after complying all the required formalities by the respective officers, as such, such a long period of time might have been consumed but we are surprised and expressed our anxiety over the submission made by the learned Deputy Attorney General because a citizen cannot be led to suffer for the ignorance or indifference or even carelessness on the part of any servant of the republic. We, therefore, consider for non-action on the part of the officers of the respondents have committed malice in law because they were aware that after recomm-endation of the Public Service Commission (PSC) they should have given a decision as to the appointment and regularization of the petitioners services. We also consider that the petitioner should not suffer for inaction or the fault on the part of the respondents. As the learned Advocate for the petitioner made submission not to press part of Rule regarding the vires in law, we are not passing any decision thereabout.<br/><br/>Finally we consider that after nationalization of a non- government College the respondents must act promptly in order to give peace of mind to the Lecturers or Assistant Professors who became employees of the government by virtue of the Absorption Rules, 2000 which came into effect on 01.02.1978. Rule 6(5) validly required regularization for encadre of a teacher or lecturer but the malicious inaction on the part of the respondents is to be declared illegal, therefore, without lawful authority.<br/><br/>We, therefore, find merit in part of each of the Rules.<br/><br/>In the result, the Rule issued in Writ Petition No. 10075 of 2011 and the Rule issued in Writ Petition No. 3230 of 2014 are made absolute in part.<br/><br/>The respondents are hereby directed to regularize the service of the petition in W.P. No. 10075 of 2011 from 22.12.1994 under Rules, 1981 and also the petitioners in W.P. No. 3230 of 2014 from 03.07.2006 under Rules, 2000 which came effect from 01.02.1978 within 3(three) months from the receipt of this judgment and order.<br/><br/>The office is directed to communicate the judgment and order to the persons concerned immediately.<br/><br/><strong> Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
