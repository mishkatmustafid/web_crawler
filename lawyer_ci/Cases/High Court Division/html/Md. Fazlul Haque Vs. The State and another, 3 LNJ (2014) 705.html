Abu Zafor Siddique,J:</u></strong></span><br/> <br/>This Appeal has been preferred against the judgment and order dated 24.03.2009 by which the learned Divisional Special Judge, Rajshahi, in Special Case No.2 of 1998 (Naogaon) convicted the appellant under sections 409, 420 and 477(a) of the Penal Code read with section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 and sentenced him under section 409 of the Penal Code to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10(ten) years and also to a pay fine of taka 1,00,000/-(one lac), in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 2(two) years more.<br/> <br/>The prosecution case, in short, is that the convict-appellant Md. Fazlul Haque, while acting as an officer of the Janata Bank, Nozipur Branch, Naogaon, misappropriated a total amount of Tk. 1,30,223.90 during the calendar year 1984. This money relates to the agricultural loan activities of the Bank. The appellant misappropriated the said money in the following manner:</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"> he realized Tk. 1,16,218.90 from 68 loanees, but without depositing the same, he recorded the amount in the ledger book of the Bank against the names of false and imaginary loanees;    </li><li style="text-align: justify;">he recorded entries in the ledger book about 8(eight) false vouchers showing distribution of Tk. 6,508/- as loan for purchase of fertilizers;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">he realized from 3(three) loanees an excess amount of Tk. 497 and misappropriated the same;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">he showed some false and imaginary (ভূয়া) persons as loanees receiving Tk. 4,000/- as loan, and misappropriated the same.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">The District Anti-corruption Officer, Naogaon lodged the First Information Report (<strong>shortly the FIR</strong>) on the basis of a preliminary inquiry on an application made by another officer of the Bank named Md. Rezaul Karim, recorded as DAB E.R.No.22/91. After lodging FIR, the informant himself conducted part of the investigation. Upon his transfer, his two successors conducted the remaining part of the investigation. The 3rd investigating officer submitted charge-sheet on 21.01.1998 under sections 409/420/477(Ka)/109 of the Penal Code read with section 5(2) of the Anti-corruption Act, 1947 against the convict-appellant and another person named Samorendra Nath, being a fertilizer dealer.<br/><br/>The case was ultimately transferred to the learned Divisional Special Judge, Rajshahi for trial. Charge was framed under sections 409/ 420/477(Ka)/109 of the Penal Code read with section 5(2) of the Anti-corruption Act, 1947. During trial the prosecution produced oral and documentary evidence through 13 out of 25 witnesses cited in the charge-sheet. The defence produced none. From the trend of cross-examination of the P.Ws., the defence pleas appear to be of innocence and wrong investigation and conspiracy. After hearing arguments and on an appraisal of the evidence and materials on record and in view of the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned trial Judge found that the prosecution succeeded in bringing the charge home as against the appellant. Accordingly, he convicted and sentenced the appellant by the impugned judgment, but acquitted the other accused Samorendra.<br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence, the appellant preferred the instant appeal.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Sajjad Ali Chowdhury, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the convict-appellant, submitted that the learned Divisional Special Judge, has misread the evidence and misinterpreted the law, and thus passed the impugned judgment and order which is not tenable in the eye of law.<br/> <br/>He further submitted that the prosecution miserably failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, as not a single witnesses supported the prosecution case, and that this is a case of no evidence.<br/> <br/>Mr. Chowdhury, the learned advocate, lastly submitted that the trial court did not apply judicial mind to the facts and circumstances of the case and thus arrived at a wrong decision.<br/> <br/>In reply Mr. A.K.M. Fazlul Haque, the learned Advocate on behalf of the respondent No.2, being the Anti-corruption Commission, submitted that the prosecution, by producing the relevant documentary and oral evidence, successfully proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and there is nothing wrong in the impugned judgment calling for interference by this court and therefore the appeal should be dismissed.<br/><br/>We have considered the submission of both sides and perused the materials on record of the trial court including the entire evidence and the impugned judgment.<br/><br/>The essence of the charge is that the accused, by taking advantage of his official position as an officer of the Janata Bank, Nozipur Branch, Naogaon, misappropriated Tk.1,30,223.90. The major portion of this amount was Tk.1,16,218.90 which was realized from 68 loanees of the Bank, but this realized money was recorded in the ledger book in the names  of false and imaginary loanees. The remaining amount of the misappropriated money relates to other activities of the accused. So these allegations are basically account matters. The accusations appear refer to various documents. In an attempt to prove these documents. The officers of DAB seized a number of documents in terms of several number seizure lists being Exts.3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10. Photo copies of the bank documents, seized by those seizure lists, have also been produced. A part from the said seizure list and the bank documents, a report of the handwriting expert (Ext.8) has also been produced.<br/><br/>We have perused these documents and other documentary and oral evidence. But the contents of these documents are not traceable in the deposition of the witnesses. Their statements hardly identify the contents of those documents so asto relate them to the charge.

Trend of their deposition indicate that they appeared before the trial court as a mere formality and not to disclose their knowledge about the allegation of misappropriation.<br/><br/>Considering the facts and circumstances and other aspects of this case, we are of the view that prosecution failed to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt. The learned Special Judge without properly considering the evidence on record convicted and sentenced the appellant and therefore the impugned judgment is liable to be set aside and the convict-appellant is to be acquitted.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.
