On 12.05.2013, a Selection Committee was constituted for appointing the MD of the PDBF. As per the decision of the Selection Committee, the intending candidates were called for an interview which was held on the same day (12.05.2013). According to the assessment of the Selection Committee, the petitioner stood first securing 89 marks out of 100 marks. As such the Selection Committee proposed his name to the Board of Governors of the PDBF for his appointment to the post of its MD. On 12.05.2013, the Board of Governors held its 61<sup>st</sup> Meeting and unanimously decided to appoint the petitioner as the MD of the PDBF under certain terms and conditions. One of the conditions (clause 14) was that the petitioner would be entitled to continue his service as the MD of the PDBF up to the age of 60 years. Accordingly an appointment letter was issued in his favour on 13.05.2013. On the self-same date (13.05.2013), he submitted his joining letter as the MD of the PDBF to the Chairman of the Board of Governors which was duly accepted on 13.05.2013. Having been appointed as the MD of the PDBF, the petitioner had been discharging his duties and responsibilities to the satisfaction of all concerned. In the 69<sup>th</sup> Meeting of the Board of Governors of the PDBF held on 28.12.2016, the respondent no. 3 disclosed that he had already received a report from the Inquiry Committee formed at the 68<sup>th</sup> Board Meeting to enquire into the irregularities occurred in the process of appointment of the MD of the PDBF. The respondent no. 3 did not unveil the inquiry report at the 69<sup>th</sup> Board Meeting. However, at the concluding stage of that Board Meeting, the respondent no. 3, without taking any consent from any of the Members of the Board of Governors, declared that the petitioner would be terminated from the service of the respondent no. 2.

Clause 14 of the aforesaid terms and conditions specifically provides that the petitioner may hold the post of the MD of the PDBF till completion of 60 years of age. After the issuance of the impugned order, 6(six) Members out of 9(nine) Members of the Board of Governors, recorded notes of dissent to the effect that the decision of termination of the petitioner had been taken solely by the Chairman of the PDBF. So the impugned order of termination dated 28.12.2016 of the petitioner from the post of the MD of the PDBF is clearly without lawful authority and of no legal effect. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In the Supplementary Affidavit dated 18.09.2017 filed by the petitioner, it has been stated that in pursuance of Rule 10 of the Service Rules for the position of the MD of the PDBF, the MD can be terminated with the majority votes of the Board of Governors. But in view of the notes of dissent given by 6(six) Members out of 9(nine) Members of the Board of Governors, it is palpably clear that the petitioner was not terminated from the service of the PDBF with the majority votes of the Members of the Board of Governors.

This Inquiry Committee was constituted with a mala fide intention with a view to ousting him from the post of the MD of the PDBF. So the inquiry report dated 20.12.2016 can not be the basis for termination of the petitioner from the service of the PDBF.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">8.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The respondent nos. 2 and 3 have contested the Rule by filing a joint Affidavit-in-Opposition.

The Service Rules for the position of the MD were framed by the Board of Governors of the PDBF at its 2<sup>nd</sup> Meeting held on 23.05.2000. As per Rule 7 of the aforementioned Service Rules, the MD will be hired on contract for a term of three years subject to satisfactory annual performance of service by the Board. This contract may be extended by the Board subject to the satisfaction of all other terms and conditions of employment. The appointment letter of the petitioner dated 13.05.2013 as the MD of the PDBF was issued in violation of Rule 7 of the Service Rules at his instance so as to suit his convenience. In this respect, he misused his position as the officiating MD of the PDBF. However, pursuant to Rule 7 of the Service Rules, the tenure of the petitioner as the MD of the PDBF expired on 12.05.2016 and thereafter his contractual service was never extended by the Board of Governors. After expiry of his tenure on 12.05.2016, he was holding the post of the MD of the PDBF without any legal basis. As the petitioner’s contractual period came to an end on 12.05.2016, he made an attempt to extend his tenure by publishing a gazette notification dated 19.09.2016 in a fraudulent manner. When the fraud was detected by the Board of Governors of the PDBF, the gazette notification dated 19.09.2016 was cancelled by issuing another gazette notification dated 06.11.2016. Be that as it may, the Board of Governors took a very lenient view and terminated the petitioner from the post of the MD by a letter dated 28.12.2016 in compliance with the Service Rules for the position of the MD of the PDBF. Anyway, Regulation 61(2) of </span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: MoinaNormal;">fõ£ c¡¢lâ ¢h­j¡Qe g¡E­¾Xne LjÑQ¡l£ Q¡L¥l£ fË¢hd¡ej¡m¡, 2011</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> (hereinafter referred to as the Regulations of 2011) was inadvertently referred to in the impugned Memo of termination. As the service of the petitioner came to an end automatically after expiry of 3(three) years on 12.05.2016, there remained virtually nothing for his termination and he was released from his post by the impugned Memo dated 28.12.2016. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">10.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">At the 69<sup>th</sup> Board Meeting dated 28.12.2016 of the PDBF, the inquiry report dated 20.12.2016 and other materials on record were taken into account by the Board and thereafter the Board decided to release the petitioner from his service. So by no stretch of imagination, it can be said that the decision of termination/release of the petitioner from the post of the MD was solely taken by the Chairman (respondent no. 3) of the PDBF. That decision for termination/release of the petitioner was taken after long deliberations under the agenda item no. 7. The Service Rules for the position of the MD of the PDBF that were approved at the 2<sup>nd</sup> Meeting of the Board of Governors are still in force. However, the petitioner was appointed in accordance with the decision of the 61<sup>st</sup> Board Meeting of the PDBF wherein it was simply stated in clause 14 that he would be eligible to hold the post of the MD up to his 60<sup>th</sup> year; but it was never spelt out that pursuant to the appointment letter, he would continue as the MD of the PDBF in derogation of the Service Rules. The Service Rules were framed pursuant to section 11(6) of </span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: MoinaNormal;">fõ£ c¡¢lâ ¢h­j¡Qe g¡E­äne BCe, 1999 (1999 p­el 23 ew BCe)</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> (hereinafter adverted to as the Act No. 23 of 1999). Although the decision for termination/release of the petitioner from the post of the MD was taken unanimously; yet the petitioner misguided some of the Board Members and obtained the alleged notes of dissent. But subsequently 4(four) Board Members realized the real state of affairs and the fraudulent practice of the petitioner and withdrew their earlier notes of dissent. What is more, the decision taken at the 69<sup>th</sup> Board Meeting was afterwards confirmed by the 70<sup>th</sup> Board Meeting of the PDBF. So on this count, no exception can be taken to the impugned Memo dated 28.12.2016. Given this scenario, there is no illegality or irregularity in issuing the order of termination/release of the petitioner from the post of the MD of the PDBF. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">11.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">However, as the service of the petitioner was contractual in nature and as it was not a statutory contract, the appropriate remedy, if any, of the petitioner lies in a properly constituted suit for damages in the competent Civil Court under section 73 of the Contract Act, 1872 for alleged violation of any terms of the contract. In other words, the petitioner can not invoke the writ jurisdiction of the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution for necessary redress arising out of his termination/release from the post of the MD of the PDBF.

As he was well aware of the Service Rules, he can not turn round and deny that he was appointed on contractual basis. With regard to the termination/release of the petitioner from the PDBF, the principle of natural justice has no manner of application as his service was governed by the terms and conditions of the contract.

As the petitioner was appointed under certain terms and conditions pursuant to the decision of the 61<sup>st</sup> Board Meeting, the question of applicability of Rule 7 of the Service Rules is out of the question. In any view of the matter, the authority can not go beyond the terms and conditions as stipulated in the letter of appointment of the petitioner as the MD of the PDBF. He was appointed as the MD on full-time basis and as per his appointment letter, the tenure of his service is up to 60 years of age. The termination/release of the petitioner from the post of the MD is a feat of high-handedness of the Chairman of the PDBF. The petitioner was not afforded any opportunity of being heard prior to the issuance of the termination letter.

In this regard, clause 14 of Annexure-‘C’ may be gone into. As per clause 14, the petitioner was set to function as the MD of the PDBF up to the age of 60 years at the most. It is his claim that before attainment of 60 years of age, he can not be terminated from service as was done by Annexure-‘E’ to the Writ Petition. The record indicates that the previous 3(three) MDs, namely, Mr. A. Q. Siddiqui, Mr. Mohammad Mortuza and Mr. Md. Shamsuzzaman were appointed pursuant to the Service Rules (in fact, Regulations) for the position of the MD and all of them signed their respective contracts in presence of witnesses; but in the instant case before us, no independent deed of contract was drawn up.

Q. Siddiqui, Mr. Mohammad Mortuza and Mr. Md. Shamsuzzaman. In this perspective, the facts and circumstances of the present case unerringly reveal that as an insider, that is to say, as the officiating MD of the PDBF, the petitioner orchestrated the entire process of his appointment as the MD of the PDBF so as to suit his convenience and the Board of Governors simply relied on him.

What does this obnoxious, freakish and unseemly conduct of the petitioner demonstrate? This conduct of the petitioner, to our mind, demonstrates that he has approached the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution with unclean and dirty hands. It goes without saying that the Writ Court is also a Court of equity. It is a settled proposition of law that one who seeks equity must come with clean hands.

A contract for personal service as will appear from section 21(b) of the Specific Relief Act can not be specifically enforced. But it is not even necessary to invoke section 21(b) for such a contract is unenforceable on account of section 21(b) wherein it is provided that a contract for the non-performance of which compensation in money is adequate relief can not be specifically enforced. In a case where there is a contract between a master and a servant the master agreeing to pay the salary and the servant agreeing to render personal service it is obvious that money compensation is full relief, for all that the servant was entitled to under the contract was his salary. A breach of contract can give rise to only two relief’s: damage or specific performance. If specific performance be barred, the only relief available is damages.

The facts and circumstances of the case irresistibly lead us to uphold the contention of the contesting respondents that the petitioner was governed by the Rule of Master and Servant. As such the Board of Governors, that is to say, the master had the authority to terminate the petitioner (servant) at any time even before his attainment of 60 years of age as contemplated by clause 14. This is because no servant can be forced upon an unwilling master, for whatever reason it is. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">54.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">There is another aspect of the case.

By virtue of the provisions of section 16 of the General Clauses Act, the Board of Governors being the appointing authority had the power to terminate the appointment of the petitioner as the MD of the PDBF and accordingly it terminated the appointment. This power of termination under section 16 of the General Clauses Act has been dealt with in the decision in the case of Professor Dr. Md. Yusuf Ali Vs. Chancellor of Rajshahi University, Rajshahi and ors. reported in 50 DLR (HCD) 1.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">55.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">It is an indubitable fact that the petitioner was not afforded any opportunity of being heard prior to his termination by the Board of Governors as evidenced by Annexure-‘E’ to the Writ Petition. Can the Board of Governors terminate him without giving him any prior show cause notice? The 3-Member Inquiry Committee examined the petitioner and he submitted his written statement to the Inquiry Committee. The Inquiry Committee in its turn considered the pros and cons of the matter under inquiry and made its own findings. On the basis of the findings arrived at by the 3-Member Inquiry Committee, the Board of Governors terminated the petitioner by Annexure-‘E’ to the Writ Petition and that was subsequently endorsed by the Board of Governors at its 70<sup>th</sup> Meeting. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">56.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">It is a truism that no servant is entitled to any prior show cause notice in case of his dismissal, removal, termination etc. by his master.

A reference to the materials on record reveals in unmistakable terms that the Board Members of the PDBF conducted themselves in a very negligent, callous and lackadaisical manner. For all the ills centring round the process of the appointment of the petitioner to the post of the MD of the PDBF, they blamed the then officiating MD of the PDBF, that is to say, the present petitioner. They did not feel even a twinge of conscience at their irresponsible conduct of the whole <span style="color: #000000;">affair.
