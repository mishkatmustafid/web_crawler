In all the decisions we get if there is departure from the FIR then the accused may get benefit in the case and the value of departure will consider how much benefit the accused can claim from the case.

In this case the date of occurrence has been shown in  the FIR as 19.07.2008, on Saturday  at night and the FIR was lodged on 22.07.2008 at 23.30 hours and in the FIR it has been stated that on 19.07.2008, Saturday in the morning the informant went out of the house and after works returned home and heard that his son Majid aged about 13 years has not  returned home  and his daughter Kulsum age 10(ten) years informed him and told that on that date at about 10.00 a.m Nur Nobi aged 15 Years of the same homestead has taken his son to see the paddy field and on that date at 12.30 p.m <br/>Nur Nobi returned home and Kulsum asked him as to why Abdul Majid  has not come and where is Abdul Majid and Nur Nobi replied that he has gone to grandfather house.

On getting that information he and village people went there and by seeing the red chek shirt half sleeve shirt in the dead body.  He identified that the dead body was of his son Abdul  Majid and there was no Lungi in his body.

He informed the matter to the local Union Parishad Chairman and who informed the Police Station. The Police came from the Police Station and prepared inquest report and then sent the dead body to morgue. As such legal action against them should be taken. The informant was also examined as P.W-2 who in his evidence stated that on 29.07.2008, Saturday, 10.00 a.m accused Nur Nobi called his son Abdul Majid in the paddy field, he did not see it himself. He was then engaged in a marriage ceremony near his house and at that time his daughter Kulsum was in the house. He returned home and did not found Abdul Majid. Then daughter Kulsum told that Majid has been called by Nur Nobi and when Nur Nobi was asked he said that Majid has gone to his grandfather house. Two things we get here, one is that in the First Information Report, the informant said that he was busy, he went out of the house for his work after completion of the work he came back to his house. After that nothing has been stated in the FIR regarding the fact of any marriage ceremony and in the evidence he has not  stated regarding going out for work but regarding in the marriage ceremony which is absent in the FIR. It further appears from both the FIR and the statement P.W-2 that on query of Kulsum accused Nur Nobi replied that Majid has gone to his grandfather house. This information P.W-2 received from her daughter Kulsum and Kulsum in her evidence as P.W-10 stated that Nur Nobi returned at about 12.00 noon, he was asked regarding Majid and Nur Nobi told that Majid has gone to his grandfather house. On that date there was the marriage ceremony of Jarina and at that time in the house only Kulsum and his brother Abdul Majid were there. It is in evidence that this  P.W-2 has got children  and wife and out of them, five went to the marriage ceremony except Son Abdul Majid aged at 13 years and daughter Kulsum aged at 10 years. Then Kulsum told her father that Nur Nobi told that after that her brother Hamid came from the  grandfather house and on query he said that Majid has not gone to grandfather house. This Hamid is the brother of Kulsum who negated the defence plea that victim went to the house of grandfather has not been examined in this case and no reason has been given as to why he was not examined. Although he is a vital witness in this case regarding the negation of the defence plea that victim has gone to the house of grandfather, when there is an explanation given by the accused that victim has gone to his grandfather house we cannot say that accused has not given any reply to going of the victim and last seen theory between these two cannot be established when an explanation was   given by one of the persons regarding this. In the said matter, we find one explanation by the accused that the victim has gone to the grandfather house. That explanation has tried to be negated by the statement stating that Abdul Hamid came and said that the victim has not gone to grandfather house and this statement is a hear say evidence received from Abdul Hamid by Kulsum. Until and unless Abdul Hamid comes to the court and says this, this statement of Kulsum remains hear say evidence and can not be accepted in the eye of law. Had Abdul Hamid examined in this case and this story was stated by him that the deceased went to the house of grandfather. Then negation of the defence case could have been established but in this case that has not been done, that means in this case there is last seen theory but with an explanation and we cannot held that no explanation was given in this case by the accused person. The learned Deputy Attorney General has placed before us, the case of Jafor Ali-Versus-The state reported in 1988  SCMR-2669- wherein it is clearly stated that- last seen evidence is not sufficient for establishing the guilt where it required making  a conjecture to connect the accused with the crime and where there are reasonable possibility that someone else might have committed the offence, no reasonable ground can be drawn that the accused committed the offence after the victim has been last seen there. In absence of reasonable explanation from the accused side it was held that-the last <span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">seen theory to implicate him is applicable. In this</span> <span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">case there is an explanation given by the accused</span> and that explanation could not be negated by the prosecution side and as such this decision does not apply suitable in favour of the prosecution in the facts and circumstances of the case. The case of Md. Salim-Versus-The state, reported in 4BLC-261, it is an established principle that the evidence of witnesses it is found that victim was last seen in the company of the accused-person including the appellant then he is liable to be convicted but in this case this point of explanation given by the accused was not there and as such in this facts and circumstances of the case this decision does not suitably apply in the instance case. In the case 1986BLD(AD)-79 we get that in the absence of any other reasonable explanation as to the said departure of the deceased from the company of the appellant no conclusion other than guilt of the  appellant can be drawn.  It is seen that in this case there was no other reasonable explanation except that the persons was present with the deceased and in the instant case there is a reasonable explanation as to the said departure of the victim from the group of the company because if the statement of the accused is believed that the victim has gone to the house of his   grandfather, then the last seen theory with the victim and the accused does not remain and something more fact come about the existance of the victim in other places but those things have not come before this court after reasonable  explanation given by the accused. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">42.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">        </span></span></strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">As such this case does not support the prosecution at all rather it supports the defence case. When reasonable explanation has been given the accused is entitled to get benefit of doubt. At the instant case we have already discussed that there is some sort of departure from the FIR in the evidence and the effect of departure also we have considered the learned advocate for the defence has placed some decisions which we have mentioned earlier. In all the decisions we get if there is departure from the FIR then the accused may get benefit in the case and the value of departure will consider how much benefit the accused can claim from the case. In the instant case that there was no statement that there was marriage ceremony where the inmates of the house of the victim attended and P.W-2 that is the  father of the victim went to attend the marriage ceremony with his family. The marriage ceremony is not mentioned in the FIR rather in FIR it is stated that he went for his work and in the evening he has returned after completion of the work. This difference in the FIR and the statement of witnesses according to us is not so fatal because this witness No.2 was not present for the whole day in his house. This departure from the FIR so far this part is concerned is not so vital and as such it does not affect the prosecution in the instant case. But regarding attending in a marriage ceremony we get from P.W-12 that he attended the marriage of Jorina, with his wife, son Shahid daughter Shakhina, son Abdul Hamid, son Abdul Hannan on Friday and returned on Saturday. After that Abdul Majid and others returned home. He told that he returned at about 10.00 in the morning. That means P.W-2 admitted that victim Abdul Majid also attended the marriage ceremony but the other witnesses we get that Abdul Majid did not attend the marriage ceremony. He was present in the house along with sister Kulsum. At one stage of  the cross examination this P.W-2 stated that he returned from marriage on Saturday, after that Abdul Majid and others return home, immediately after he stated that  Abdul Majid attended the marriage ceremony and on Friday he returned home. We find this type of discrepancies in the evidence of P.W.-2 and as such we cannot put reliance upon the evidence of this P.W-2 the father of the victim.  It is also in evidence that out of 7(seven) children except Kulsum all others attended the marriage ceremony. Kulsum is aged about 08(eight) years at that time. It is very difficult to believe that the parents along with 6 children attended the marriage ceremony except this Kulsum aged 08 years, that also put some doubt in the evidence adduced by P.w-2 and the case of prosecution that Kulsum did not attend the marriage ceremony. Then upon perusal her statement that on the date of examination she is aged 10(ten) years and accused Nur Nobi took Abdul Majid towards the paddy field and on her request Abdul Majid cut some straw to give food to cows and when at 12.00 noon, Nur Nobi returned and she asked regarding Majid and was told that Majid has gone to his grandfather house and on that date her father and mother went to the marriage ceremony of Jarina her cousin sister  and she along with Majid was in house. We got the evidence of P.W-2 that Majid also attended the marriage ceremony. He is a child witness in all respect and normally child witnesses do not give any false statement but it should also to be remembered in mind that they can lie if trained, specially when enmity between the parties are admitted. Regarding child witnesses a decision has been placed which is reported in 44DLR-246 wherein it is clearly stated that the confidence of the child witnesses is beyond question but it requires to be scrutinized  with caution to see whether this suffer from inconsistency. To give conviction upon this evidence it requires corroboration. In the instant case, we find that this P.W-10 a child witness has stated the evidence but there are some discrepancies in the evidence of P.W-2 her father and herself and regarding the statement of this witness no corroboration is there and as such we feel that although the evidence of this witness cannot be discarded as a whole but it cast a doubt in our mind as to the absolute truthfulness of this evidence. P.W-11 Nur Jahan is a lady who claims to be eye witness of going the victim and the accused appellant jointly. This witness is the wife of Nur Nobi who happens to be full brother of the informant. Moreover, about hundred yard distance whether it is possible for her, to see and indentify these two boys aged about 12/13 years to go jointly towards paddy field is a question which arose in our mind. It is further admitted that this Nur Nobi the husband of the witness has got disputes with the parents of the accused-appellant and he also accompanied the informant to the police Station to lodge FIR but this Nur Nobi has also not been examined in this case. Had the fact of identification by Nur Jahan was true then surely on 22.07.2008 when the ejahar was lodged this witness  and her husband Nur Nobi along with informant could have brought this matter of identification by Nurjahan in the First Information Report. But that is not there.  Another thing struck our mind that from 19.07.2008 this boy was missing, but what prompted the father and other persons not to lodge any G.D entry nor lodge any case in the police Station and according to the prosecution the fact of calling the victim by the accused Nur Nobi was there within the knowledge of Kulsum, her father, Nur Jahan and what prompted them not to file the case against him in this respect.  Upon perusal of the whole record we do not find any material before recovery of the dead body of the victim that anything has been done by the prosecution side in this respect.  The dead body was recovered on 22.07.2008 and after that the information was given to the local chairman, and then to the police station, resulting coming of the police and other things happened. There is no reason and explanation given by the prosecution side as to why they did not take <span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">any step in between these three days after victim</span> Majid was abducted or taken away. With respect the time and manner of occurrence the learned advocate for the appellant has seriously raised question. He has shown us the postmortem report which does not show any age of injury in the post mortem report although there is no column to write age of injury but in a certificate of report it is a duty of the doctor to write the age of injury in that. In absence of that it is not possible to prove at what time the injury took place. In the instant case we also find that no age of injury has been given and as such the prosecution lack in material facts to show that when the occurrence of actual death or injury was caused. In support of this point Mr. Mahmood has placed before us a case of Abdur Rahid -versus- The State reported in 27 DLR (AD)-1. Wherein it has been found that the doctor while holding the post mortem examination did not record the age of the injury, in a case of murder the age of injury is an important fact to determine the approximate time of occurrence and in the instant case the approximate time of occurrence could not be established for not noting the age of the injury by the doctor and that falls upon the prosecution that the time of occurrence has not been established. In this case upon perusal of the post mortem report we find that the position of the dead body was decomposed and in the opinion that doctor   said death was due to asphyxia as a result of throttling which was anti mortem and homicidal in nature. No sign of injury was available in the whole body but it is in evidence that the dead body was decomposed. The dead body was recovered from under water in a paddy field. Mr. Shihab Uddin Mahmood has placed before us from the medical jurisprudence of Modi that if a body kept in water for four or five days, then very little change if water is cold. Rigor mortis may persist. If it is from five to seven days, then the skin of the hands and feet becomes sodden and bleached. The face appears softened and has a faded white colour. Regarding floatation of a body he submitted that the gases of decomposition developed within a sub merged body cause it to rise to the surface, unless it is entangled in weeds ropes or any other impediment. In India a submerged body comes to the surface within 24 hours in summer and within two or three days or more (rarely more than a weak) in winter. He submitted that because the time was of July, within two or three days this body must be floated in the water but the instant case he said that dead body was recovered from under water in a paddy field. According to him this time given by the prosecution of alleged kidnapping and then recovery etc. does not tally with the medical jurisprudence and a doubt is created as to the manner and time of occurrence. Regarding the identification of the body it was also stated that the father identified the body seeing the red shirt only. The body was at such a condition that the body could not be identified. On perusal of this it is clean that medical jurisprudence does not show to support that this body was under water within less than three days time. Considering all these things we are of the view that in these aspects also the case of the prosecution has failed, to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Considering all these things we are of the view that in the instant case upon consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case and on materials on record the prosecution could not prove this case against this accused appellant beyond all reasonable doubt and as such the accused is entitled to get acquittal. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">43.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">        </span></span></strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">Thus the appeal is allowed.
