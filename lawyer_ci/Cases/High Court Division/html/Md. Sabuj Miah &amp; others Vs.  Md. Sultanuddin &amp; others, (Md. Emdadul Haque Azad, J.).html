Case No. 23/67-68 and on 15.02.1971 she received compensation against that acquisition for which she lost her subsisting interest in the suit land and therefore, subsequent transfers of the same from 21.11.1982 to 30.10.2004 by the so-called transferees and successive transferees of Alimon Nesa by the impugned sale deeds and hiba-bil-ewaj deeds as contained in Exhibit 5-14 happen to be sham and mere paper transactions given the fact that the suit land having earlier been acquired for a public purpose, subsequent sale and delivery of possession thereof was impossible. Although the defendants contended that only 3 decimals of land was acquired from Alimon Nesa, they did neither produce any evidence to substantiate that contention nor did they raise any objection against Exhibit 15 and 50 before the either of the lower courts in spite of having ample opportunity to do so and as such their main contention falls through.
