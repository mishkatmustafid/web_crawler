The petitioner is also the Managing Director and shareholder in the capital of the respondent no. 7 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Borrower-Company’), which is also a company limited by shares and incorporated under the Companies Act. The respondent no. 1 is the Bangladesh Bank, which is established as the central Bank by the Bangladesh Bank Order, 1972 and the regulatory body of all banking companies in Bangladesh. The respondent nos. 2 and 3 are the responsible officials of the Banking Regulation and Policy Department (BRPD) of the Bangladesh Bank and the respondent no. 4 (hereinafter referred to either as the One Bank or the lender Bank) is a banking company regulated under the Banking Companies Act and the respondent no. 5 is the responsible official of the Khatungonj Branch of the respondent no. 4. In the course of business, the respondent no. 4 through its Khatungonj Branch, Chattogram sanctioned various credit facilities viz, Time Loan, Term Loan, SLC/CLC/ Acceptance, LTR, BG, etc., in favour of the Borrower-Company upon obtaining adequate securities vide different sanction letters. The said facilities were from time to time renewed, reviewed, converted and rescheduled, as and when the situation warranted. Lastly, under a review/restructuring arrangement vide Sanction Letter dated 29.09.2016, the following arrangements were made by the respondent no. 4; a) the liabilities of the Borrower-Company under Time Loan and OD were converted into a Term Loan of TK. 21.13 crore, b) existing Term Loan liability of Tk. 20.39 crore was reviewed, and c) existing SLC/ULC/Acceptance, Time Loan, LTR, BG facilities were cancelled.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Thereafter, the Borrower-Company from time to time requested the lender Bank to sanction new credit line and, thereby, to facilitate the Borrower-Company to repay the aforesaid stuck-up liabilities smoothly. However, despite repeated persuasions, the lender Bank did not extend any kind of co-operation whatsoever to the Borrower-Company. Besides, the lender Bank refrained from opening any L/C which caused a huge setback in continuing its regular business. Since the company’s business fully depends upon import from abroad/local market by way of opening the L/C, the stoppage of opening any new L/C facility by the lender Bank placed the business of the Borrower-Company in complete deadlock. Recently, time and again, the Borrower-Company vide its letters dated 14.02.2018, 13.03.2018, 28.03.2018, 23.04.2018, 16.05.2018, 27.06.2018, 23.07.2018 requested the lender Bank either to re-fix its liability waiving interest and allow 2(two) years’ time to repay the loan, or to reschedule the liability for adjustment purpose. At the same time, the Borrower-Company requested the lender Bank to sanction fresh working capital. In order to approve the said proposal, the Borrower-Company paid off Tk. 1.40 crore as down payment. Although the lender Bank on principle agreed to reschedule the liability of the Borrower-Company, nonetheless, without paying any heed to the business dilemma of the Borrower-Company, they put preconditions to pay additional Tk. 2.35 crore as down payment and to provide with additional security in the form of mortgage. In such situation, the Borrower-Company vide its letter dated 27.08.2018 requested the lender Bank to fix its liability as of 20.07.2018 and provide its Board approval as to the agreed rescheduling in order to facilitate the Borrower-Company to pay the balance down payment.

The petitioner also requested (a) to advise the respondent no. 3 to rescind its notice dated 16.08.2018, and (b) to direct the lender Bank to provide its Board approval as to the agreed rescheduling to pay off the Borrower-Company’s liability smoothly. The respondent no. 1 received the said representation on 09.10.2018 and meanwhile, 15 (fifteen) days had already elapsed, but they did not give any decision within the time prescribed by Section 17(3) of the Banking Companies Act.

Their common contentions are that the petitioner is the Managing Director and shareholder of the Borrower-Company, which borrowed money from the lender Bank through different credit facilities and also by furnishing various securities in favour of the lender Bank. But due to failure of regular payment of the loan money by the Borrower-Company, it accrued a huge amount of loan liability. In such a stagnant situation, the petitioner, in a meeting held on 09.07.2018 with the lender Bank, agreed to deposit Tk. 2.35 crore as down payment which is only 5% against the petitioner’s loan outstanding of 46.37 crore as on 30.06.2018 and accepting the said meeting as successful negotiation, the lender Bank issued letter dated 17.07.2018 requesting the petitioner to deposit the said down payment and to complete mortgage formalities of 38 decimals of land as agreed earlier. But the respondent no. 4 received only Tk. 0.45 crore through PO on 25.07.2018. In view of such situation, the lender Bank issued a letter under memo dated 31.07.2018 to the Borrower-Company represented by the Managing Director (petitioner) requesting him to deposit rest of the down payment of Tk. 2.54 crore at the earliest as per Bangladesh Bank requirement contained in Bangladesh Bank Rescheduling Guidelines, failing which the Bank would be constrained to take necessary legal action against the petitioner. But the petitioner did not take any positive step regarding payment of the said down payment and, under the circumstances, the Bangladesh Bank served the notice as per provision of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act upon the petitioner vide Memo No. BPRD(R-2)651/9(26) Ga/2018-6676 dated 10.09.2018 having enclosed the notice dated 16.08.2018 issued by the lender Bank. It is stated that the petitioner having received the said notice on 24.09.2018 issued an acknowledgment receipt which has been duly forwarded by the respondent no.6 (Mercantile Bank Ltd.) to the respondent no.1 through memo dated 25.09.2018.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">6.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Thereafter, the petitioner submitted his representation in writing to the respondent no. 1 on 09.10.2018 which was duly received by the respondent no. 1 on 09.10.2018. Having received the said representation of the petitioner, the Bangladesh Bank informed the lender Bank about the said reply and sought further clarification about the service of notice under Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act. The lender Bank then under Memo dated 21.10.2018 furnished its explanation regarding service of notice under Section 17 of the said Act. Thereafter, the Bangladesh Bank gave its decision on 29.10.2018. Having received the said notice dated 29.10.2018 through Chittagong Central Jail Authority, the petitioner acknowledged receipt of the letter on 13.11.2018 and the said receipt has been forwarded by the Mercantile Bank under the memo dated 20.11.2018 to the Bangladesh Bank for taking necessary measures. Thereafter, the lender Bank issued the letter dated 22.11.2018 requesting Bangladesh Bank to take a decision commensurate with the notice served by the said Bank through Bangladesh Bank upon the petitioner as per law. Subsequently, Bangladesh Bank issued a letter under Memo dated 29.11.2018 upon the petitioner imitating that the post of the petitioner as a Director of the respondent no.6 stood vacated as per Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act with effect from 24.11.2018 and Section 17(5) of the Banking Companies Act shall come into effect to realize the dues of the lender Bank.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">7.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Mr. Shah Manjurul Haque, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner takes me through Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act and submits that the proceedings under Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act being a recovery process, the petitioner should not be removed from the position of the Director of the Mercantile Bank.

In other words, when a Director of any scheduled Bank either takes loan for himself or stands as a guarantor of another loanee, and if the loan remains unpaid despite issuance of notice by the Bangladesh Bank under Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act, his/her directorship may be vacated without exhausting the formalities set out in sub-Sections (2) &amp; (3) of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">20.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">To put the provisions of Section 17(1)(b) of the Banking Companies Act more specifically, all that this Court records here are that after issuance of notice to the defaulter Bank-Director, who has stood as a guarantor of a Borrower-Company or for a third party, when the Bangladesh Bank asks the defaulter-Bank Director to pay the loan and if the loan is not paid within two months, then the office of the defaulter-Bank Director falls vacated. Although there is a provision in sub-Section (2) of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act to allow 30 days time to explain the Bank Director’s position, but the vacancy of the office of the Bank Director shall take place, after two months of receipt of the notice under Section 17(1) of the Banking Companies Act, whether or not the Bangladesh Bank timely deals with the application of the defaulter-Bank Director’s written representation filed under Section 17(2) of the Banking Companies Act.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">21.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">After being acquainted with the provisions of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act, I may now take up the first legal issue as framed by me hereinabove, namely, whether directorship/ office of the petitioner, who is a shareholder-cum-Director of a scheduled Bank and having stood as a guarantor of the Borrower-Company has failed to pay off the loan of the Borrower-Company, is liable to be vacated. Upon meticulously going through the annexures appended to the instant application and its affidavits-in-opposition, it transpires that after issuance of notice by the lender Bank through the Bangladesh Bank to the petitioner (who has placed himself as the guarantor for the loan taken by the Borrower-Company) for paying off the loan taken by the Borrower-Company (for whom the petitioner has stood as guarantor), the petitioner admittedly failed to pay off the Borrower-Company’s loan and, consequently, after two months of receipt of the aforesaid notice, the petitioner’s office of Director has fallen vacant. Although the petitioner made a written representation under sub-Section (2) of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act within time explaining his position, the petitioner’s explanation were found to be unsatisfactory by the lender Bank and the Bangladesh Bank (respondent nos. 1-4) and, accordingly, the Bangladesh Bank rejected the petitioner’s representation within the time stipulated in sub-Section (3) of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act. The decision given by the Bangladesh Bank being final, the law would obviously take its own course under Section 17(5) of the Banking Companies Act. It is to be noticed from the language employed in sub-Sections 1, 2 &amp; 3 of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act that vacancy of directorship occurs the moment any of the events enumerated in clauses (a) to (c) of sub-Section 1 of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act takes place, for, neither any of the sub-Sections of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act nor any other provisions of the Banking Companies Act seek to halt the proceedings under Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act on the plea of filing a representation to the lender Bank or to the Bangladesh Bank or to any other authority.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">22.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">From a bare reading of the provisions of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act, it appears to me that the wordings and expressions of the law are so unambiguous that anyone with ordinary prudence would be able to understand the meaning of the provisions of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act and, therefore, the submissions advanced by the learned Advocate for the petitioner that the petitioner being not the loanee, that is to say that the petitioner being merely a guarantor of the loanee, his directorship in a scheduled Bank should not be taken away by invoking the provisions of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act, is completely misconceived. The laws herald very stoutly that a Director of any scheduled Bank whenever would be found to be either as the ‘defaulter loanee’ or as the ‘defaulter guarantor’, proceedings against the aforesaid Director under Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act would be initiated.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">        </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">23.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Now, let me take up the second issue, namely, whether the respondent nos. 1-4 were competent to commence proceedings under Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act without first going for recovery of the loan from the ‘Borrower-Company’ invoking the provision of the Artharin Ain. For adjudication upon this issue, I have read the Preamble and other relevant provisions of the Artharin Ain and, side by side, that of the Banking Companies Act and it appears to me that the scheme of these two statutes are distinct and, further, the provisions of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act and the provisions of Section 5 of the Artharin Ain provide completely different course of actions for the ‘defaulter loanee’ and ‘defaulter guarantor’. In other words, while the provisions of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act aims at vacating the directorship of a person of a scheduled Bank, Section 5 of the Artharin strategies about recovery of outstanding loan from the borrower, mortgagor and guarantor. Thus, the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner that without going for recovery of loan by invoking the provisions of the Artharin Ain from the Borrower-company at first, commencement of any proceedings under Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act is not legal, appears to me to be completely without any substance.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">24.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">With the above findings of fact and examination of legal issues, this matter is liable to be dismissed with an exemplary costs of Tk. 10,00,000/- (ten lacs).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">25.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">Before parting with this Judgment, I find it pertinent to record the reasoning for slapping a cost of Tk. 10,00,000/- in dismissing this matter. At the time of admission of this matter, this Court was not inclined to admit it making an observation in the open-Court that interpretations on Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act has been given by this Court on numerous occasions against the ‘defaulter loanee’ or the ‘defaulter guarantor’, and, therefore, there being no issue to be examined by this Court by admitting an application under Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act, admission of this matter shall simply add a case to the huge backlog of works of this Court causing wastage of its invaluable working hours. Nevertheless, the learned Advocate for the petitioner was persistently insisting upon this Court by putting his best effort to pursue this Court that there are some nexus with the provisions of Artharin Ain and the provisions of Section 17 of the Banking Companies Act and for examination of the aforesaid issue the matter should be admitted. Against the aforesaid backdrop, this Court admitted the matter with a verbal condition that the petitioner may be given an opportunity to place his case at length on the condition that upon hearing the learned Advocate for the petitioner, if this Court expresses its views against the petitioner, it shall be the duty for the petitioner not to proceed with this matter and shall non-prosecute the same at his own initiative and, further, if the learned Advocate finds any difficulty to non-prosecute this matter, at that event a cost Tk. 10,00,000/- (ten lacs) shall be slapped upon the petitioner.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing: -.2pt;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">26.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; letter-spacing: -.2pt;">With the above preconditions this matter was admitted and the learned Advocate for the petitioner was allowed to make his submissions as lengthy as he wished and eventually when he was informed by this Court that this case is going to be dismissed with a cost of Tk. 10,00,000/- as this Court found no substance in the instant matter, the petitioner opted to receive a detailed Judgment.
