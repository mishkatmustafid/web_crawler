There could not be any doubt or dispute that civil court has the jurisdiction to appoint a Receiver, but that jurisdiction depends on various circumstances. It will be profitable to refer to a decision of Madras High Court reported in A.I.R 1955 Madras 430. On a review of a large number of reported decisions of different High Courts of Sub-continent, it has laid down five principles governing the appointment of Receiver by a Civil Court and they may be enumerated as follows:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -.25in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 30.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt .75in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">(1)<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">    </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The appointment of a receiver pending in a suit is a matter resting in the discretion of the court.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -.25in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 30.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt .75in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">(2)<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">    </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The court should not appoint a receiver except upon proof by the plaintiff that prima facie he has very excellent chance of succeeding in the suit.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -.25in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 30.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt .75in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">(3)<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">    </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Not only must the plaintiff show a case of adverse and conflicting claims to property, but he must show some emergency or loss demanding immediate action and of his own right he must be reasonably clear and free from doubt. The element of danger is an important consideration. A court will not act on possible danger only; the danger must be great and imminent demanding immediate relief. It has been truly said that a court will never appoint a receiver merely on the ground that it will do no harm.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -.25in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 30.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt .75in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">(4)<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">    </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">An order appointing a receiver will not be made where it has the effect of depriving a defendant of a ‘defacto’ possession since that might cause irreparable wrong. If the dispute is as to title only, the court very reluctantly disturbs possession by receiver but if the property is exposed to danger and loss and the person in possession has obtained it through fraud or force the court will inter pose by receiver for the security of the property. It would be different where the property is shown to be ‘in medio’ that is to say in the enjoyment of no one.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -.25in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: 30.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt .75in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">(5)<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">    </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The Court, on the application made for the appointment of the receiver looks to the conduct of the party who makes the application and will usually refuse to interfere unless his conduct has been free from blame. He must come to court with clean hands and should not have disentitled himself to the equitable <span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt;">relief by latches, delay, acquiescence</span> etc.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 109%; tab-stops: 30.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">In this connection we may refer to another decision of West Pakistan High Court of Karachi Bench in the case of Mahammad Parial Vs. Bashir Ahmed and others. P.L.D. 1957 page 625 where in a suit for declaration of title and for injunction, a receiver was appointed, but the Karachi Bench set aside such appointment and while so <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">doing made a very important observation,</span> saying that it is to be seen whether the <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">court can ultimately hand over possession</span> of immovable property. In another decision in the case of Krishna Deb and others Vs. Surendra Krishna Nandi and others in 34 C.W. N. Page 440 it has been held that a creditor who has got no lion in the property cannot claim the appointment of a receiver. Woodrofee on Receiver may be mentioned to see, what is the purpose and effect of appointment of receiver; he says “The possession of a receiver appointed by the civil court during pendency of a suit should be regard as the possession for the party who might ultimately turn out to be the true owner and entitled to possession as such.” By appointment of a receiver property becomes custodian legis. The receiver is the officer of the court he holds the property as agent of the court. In the ultimate analysis, the receiver holds the property for the party entitled to possession.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list 0in left 30.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">12.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Keeping the principles aforesaid in view could there be appointment of a receiver in a suit for declaration of title simpliciter to immovable property? The problem is how the court on the conclusion of the suit could make over possession to the party so entitled, when there is no such prayer, nor the suit framed in accordance with Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act to get complete relief. The court has to answer in the negative.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list 0in left 30.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">13.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">On consideration of the application under Order 40 Rule (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure it appears to us that no ingredients whatsoever or nothing on record to indicate exigency of circumstances that may justify<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">   </span>the appointment of a receiver.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list 0in left 30.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">14.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">To consider the legality and propriety of the impugned order under challenged in the First Miscellaneous Appeal, the learned Joint District Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Dhaka without took into account the legal aspect of the matter, facts and circumstances of the suit allowed the application under Order 40 Rule (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure which calls for interference by this court.
