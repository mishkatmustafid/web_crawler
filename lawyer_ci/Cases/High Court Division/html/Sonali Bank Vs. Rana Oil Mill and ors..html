Abdul Aziz J. -</b> Thisappeal at the instance of the plaintiffs is directed against the judgment dated31-1-1991 and decree dated 23-2-1991 passed by Mr. Abdur Razzak, SubordinateJudge, Artha Rin Adalat, Feni, in Artha Rin Money Suit No.1 of 1990 decreeingthe suit in part for an amount of Taka 5,67,540.00.</p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p><p style="text-align:justify">2. The plaintiff, Sonali Bank, brought this suit for recovery of Taka22, 85,314.30 against the defendants for the amount of loan granted to themwith interest accrued thereon as on 26-5-90 on the facts, in short, that, thedefendant No. 2 made an application for loan for setting up Rana Oil Mills,defendant No.1, under 3rd International Development Agency (IDA) Credit. TheBank made feasibility report by their expert committee of the proposed projecton the application of the defendant No. 2 and found the project, the defendantNo.1, viable and eligible and sanctioned the project for loan under 3rd IDA credit.The Bank advanced a sum of Taka 7,00,000.00 as capital finance and another sumof Taka 2,70,000.00 as working capital to the defendant No.1 vide theirsanction letter dated 31-1-1984, Exhibit 1. The defendant No. 2 accepted thesanction letter containing various terms and conditions by signing the same andtook the loan placing his and his wife’s (defendant No.3) immovable propertiesunder equitable mortgage and hypothecation against project machinery andequipment, stock of raw materials. etc. as security of the loan. In thesanction letter the rate of interest or capital finance was mentioned as @ 13%per annum at half yearly rest. The period of capital loan was given for aperiod of 7 years including 12 months grace period and the period of workingcapital loan was mentioned as 4.5 years including 6 months grace period. Thesanction letter further contained the mode of repayment of capital finance by12 (twelve) half yearly installments at the rate of Taka 97,314 each payable inJune and December year. Repayment will start from 18 months of the date of 1stdisbursement of loan. Any residue to be repaid along with last instalment. Theschedule of repayments of working capital loan was by 8 half-yearly instalments@ 47,226 each payable in June and December each year, which will start from the12 month of the date of first disbursement of Any residue to be repaid with thelast instalment. The plaintiff also sanctioned a cash credit limit of Taka3,00,000 payable from Bank’s own fund, against hypothecation of raw materials,stocks, etc. and equitable mortgage of immovable properties vide letter dated1-9-1984 vide Exhibit 2, stipulating the rate of interest @ 16% per annum withpenal interest upto 20%. The Exhibit 2 further binds the defendants that, the defendantswill route his business through the plaintiff bank and that he will not borrowfrom any other bank without its prior permission. The amount of said limit ofCC credit of Taka 3 lac was however renewed and enhanced to Taka 4 lac by theplaintiff vide its letter dated 1-2- 87 on the terms and conditions mentionedtherein and also subject to recovery of the overdue amount of Taka 1,44,540fallen in arrear in the unit’s loan amount under IDA credit.</p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p><p style="text-align:justify">3. The defendant No. 2 after accepting and signing the sanction letterand mortgaging his own properties and those of his wife and executing severalbonds. DP notes and other documents in favour of the bank, set up the mill inthe building already constructed by the defendant at his own cost, and put the millinto operation on one shift basis. The further case of the plaintiff is that,though the cash credit limit was enhanced to Taka 4 lac and the amount wasdisbursed to the defendants, there were no raw materials in the mill againstthe said money. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant removed the loan moneyto different sector illegally and thereby cheated the plaintiff. It is furtheralleged that the defendants have defaulted in paying the instalment of both thecapital finance under IDA loan as well as cash credit limit from June, 1985.The plaintiff requested the defendant to make payment. But the defendantinstead of paying gave undertaking, but of no effect. The defendants asked theplaintiff to give them fresh loan of Taka 25,00,000.00 on hypothecation andpledge but as the defendants could not furnish fresh security to the bank, assuch, the plaintiff could not grant the loan. The bank asked the defendants totake loan of Taka 10 lac by way of pledge but the defendants did not take it.The defendants ultimately closed down the mill. The plaintiff served legalnotices on them for recovery of their money and ultimately filed the suit foran amount of Taka 22,85,314.30 including capital finance, working capital, cashcredit loan and interest as on 26-5-90.</p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p><p style="text-align:justify">The defendant Nos.1 and 2 appeared and contested the suit by filing ajoint written statement admitting taking the loan but contending that, therewas no cause of action for filing the suit, the suit is barred by limitationand by estoppel, waiver and acquiescence and has been filed with bad motive.The further case of the defendants is that, as per circular of the 3rd IDAcredit, the defendant No.2 submitted a project profile to the Sonali Bank, Feniin the prescribed form of the Bank for 3rd IDA credit which was ultimatelyaccepted by the plaintiff bank as an eligible and viable one. Theplaintiff-bank sanctioned a loan of Taka 9.70 lac being Taka 7 lac for capitalfinance and Taka 2, 70,000.00 for working capital. The defendants spent Taka 10lac from his own fund for land, land development, construction of factorybuilding, etc, in anticipation of reimbursement from the loan. In the circularit was mentioned, amongst others, that, the credit will be admissible to cover70% of the cost of the eligible project to be newly set up, the period of loanfor capital finance was up to 12 years including grace period of 2 to 3 years,the maturity period for working capital was up to 5 years including graceperiod. The further case of the defendants is that, although the IDA circularclearly mentioned that it would cover 70% of the cost of new project under theIDA credit, the bank disbursed only Taka 7 lac as capital finance and Taka 27lac as working capital in total Taka 9, 70,000.00 only being 35% of the estimatedproject cost and the defendants having already spent Taka 10 lac from his owncapital, he had to accept the same under compulsion. Hence he faced scarcity offund to run the mill in three shifts from one shift, to make it moreprofitable. The defendant therefore having faced acute crisis of runningcapital, requested the bank to pay a fresh loan of Taka 25, 00,000.00 but thebank asked the defendant to furnish fresh security and the defendant havingfailed to furnish fresh security, the bank did not grant the loan. The amountadvanced against cash credit limit of Taka 3,00,000.00 sanctioned on 1-9-84 wasillegally adjusted on 13-9-86. The said cash credit Accounts balance sheet cameat nil balance as on 13-9-86. The defendant requested for fresh Joan on cashcredit Account but the plaintiff-bank did not sanction it even on the nilbalance of the said cash credit limit. The cash credit limit of Taka 3,00,000was however ultimately increased to Taka 4,00,000.00 on 1-2-87 and out of theaforesaid amount of Taka 4, lac, the bank regularised their cash credit accountand applied the same to recovery of the overdue amount of Taka 1,44,540.00fallen in arrear in the unit loans under IDA credit, etc, and after theirdeductions and other payments the defendant had only Taka 25,000 from the saidaccount to run the mill. It is further stated by the defendant No. 2 that hehad already furnished security by mortgaging his own and his wife’s propertiesworth Taka 42 lac at the time of taking the original loan and, as such, theyhad no further properties to furnish additional security for their requestedloan of Taka 25,00,000.00. At that time the financial possession of thedefendant was very bad/and the plaintiff-bank having refused to grant him anyfresh loan, and served him legal notice for full payment of all the loansincluding the loans made under IDA credit, he had no option but to shut downthe mill in September, 1986. The defendants further contend that, the bank hasno right or legal authority to adjust the IDA arrear instalment from cashcredit loan and that the defendants have not defaulted in paying theinstalments. Rather the defendant has paid instalments even after closing downthe mill. The defendant has to close the Mill by retrenching the employees onpaying their wages for which he has incurred serious loss. The defendants haveso far paid Taka 5, 08,000.00 up to December 1987 from 1985 as instalmentstowards IDA loan and cash credit loan. The defendants contend that, theplaintiff has brought the suit premature only to take revenge against thedefendant No.2 who has already filed a suit being Money Suit No. 1 of 1990against the plaintiff bank for compensation for compelling them to close downthe Mill. The defendants-respondents firmly added that, the plaintiff bank hasgrossly violated the terms and conditions of 3rd IDA credit circular by notgiving loan to cover 70% of the estimated project cost for which the defendantsrespondent acutely suffered in working capital to run the mill viably. The defendantsfurther alleged that, instead of co-operation, that plaintiff brought the suitbefore the maturity of the IDA loans. Plaintiff compelled them to close downthe mill in spite of their bonafide and good repayment schedule, the defendantsalleged further adding that the plaintiff has also violated the terms of theirown sanction letter and the suit is liable to be dismissed with costs.</p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p><p style="text-align:justify">4. The parties have examined one witness each and produced somedocuments and marked exhibits admitting those into evidence. The learned trialCourt on consideration of the facts, materials and evidence of the case,decreed the suit in part for an amount of Taka 5, 67,540.00 against thedefendants out of Taka 22, 85,314.30 as claimed by the plaintiff. The plaintiffthus being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and decree has brought thisappeal. The defendants- respondents preferred no appeal and/or anycross-objection.</p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p><p style="text-align:justify">5. We have gone through the impugned judgment and decree, thepleadings of the parties, evidence and materials on the record of the case andexamined the documents marked exhibits. We have also heard the learnedAdvocates of both the parties at length.</p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p><p style="text-align:justify">6. The learned Advocate, Mr Mohammed Ali, appearing on behalf of theappellant, submits that, the plaintiff-bank has an agreement signed betweenthem and the Bangladesh Bank in respect of disbursement of 3rd IDA credit asone of the designated banks and the terms and conditions of that agreement havebeen reflected in the sanction letter, Exhibit 1, The respondent No. 2proprietor of the defendant No.1 has accepted and signed the same and receivedthe loan money as per terms and conditions of Exhibit 1 and, as such, he isbound by those terms and conditions of Exhibit 1 i.e. sanction letter, by hisown acts and deeds and is estopped from challenging the same now, that theplaintiff claimed interest as per term in Exhibit 1, that the bank sanctioned asum of Taka 3,00,000,00 as working capital in cash credit account and paid theamount to the respondents from bank’s own fund fixing interest @ 16% per annum,with penal interest @ 20% in case of default, that the plaintiff bank enhancedthe said cash credit limit subsequently to Taka 4 lac at same rate of interestand paid the same to the respondents after adjusting and regularising thearrears of the respondents. The learned Counsel further submits that, therespondents having failed to furnish fresh security against their requestedloan of Taka 15 lac against mortgage plus Taka 10 lac against pledge, the bank couldnot sanction the said loan of Taka 15 lac, but the bank agreed to pay Taka 10lac against pledge but the defendant did not accept. It is further contendedthat, the respondent was not entitled to get 70% as loan of the project valueunder IDA and they were rightly paid 35%. The appellant further contended that,the mill was not closed down due to any lapse of the bank but due to removingthe loan money to different sectors illegally with dishonest motive and due toinefficiency of the defendant No.2 to run the mill and that the defendanthaving failed to pay instalments of both IDA loan and cash credit account theplaintiff-bank was compelled to bring this suit for Taka 22,85,314.30 and thissuit has not been filed as a retaliation or revenge against the defendants forfiling their money suit against the bank. The learned Advocate submitted thatthe trial Court has illegally passed the decree in part of Taka 5, 67,540.00only disallowing the amount as prayed in the plaint including interestserroneously and that the plaintiff-bank is entitled to get a decree of the fullamount as prayed for.</p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p><p style="text-align:justify">7. The respondents, on the other hand, submits that as the applicationfor loan submitted by the defendants was under 3rd IDA credit and the samehaving been accepted by the plaintiff-bank as eligible for loan, the plaintiffought to have paid loan at the rate of 70% of the project value, that as thedefendant had already spent Taka 10 lac on land development construction andbuilding, etc, in anticipation of the said loan @ 70% to cover the project costas per circular, he had no option to back out but to sign and accept thesanction letter Exhibit 1 only 35% loan with other rigid, unfair and unequalterms, that the bank did not advance fresh loan of Taka 15 lac against mortgageand 10 lac on hypothecation as requested and applied for by him. He had toclose down the mill for paucity of fund to run the mill as he already spentTaka 10 lac from his own towards the project on the assurance of the plaintiffbefore the loan was sanctioned. That had he been paid the loan at the rate of70% to cover the cost of the project as per IDA circular and as assured by theplaintiff, and if he was granted a fresh loan as running capital, the millwould not have been shut down. The learned Advocate for the respondents furthersubmits that the respondents having already mortgaged his own and his wife’sproperties worth Taka 42 lac to the plaintiff against obtaining IDA loan, theyhad no additional properties and assets for mortgage as fresh security to theplaintiff, but the appellant-bank could easily sanction a loan of Taka 15 lacafresh against the said mortgaged properties but the bank refused and demandedfresh security. It is further contended by the respondents that the cash creditaccount of Taka 3 lac was fully adjusted and came to nil balance on 13-9-86.The appellant-bank could have sanctioned fresh loan against the said cashcredit account as running capital then and there to keep the Mill running, butdid not, that the bank renewed and enhanced the said limit of Taka 3 lac toTaka 4 lac six months after the closure of the mill and regularised the arrearsand left only a sum of Taka 25,000.00 for the respondents. That the bankimposed a transformer valued Taka 1,50,000.00 on them unnecessarily and withoutany use and demand by them and adjusted the said amount from the capitalfinance loan, that there was no condition of imposing penal and compoundinterest in respect of IDA Credit, that the respondent No.2 was bound to acceptthe sanctioned letter prepared by the Bank on their dictated terms as healready spent a good amount from their own fund, that they did not default inmaking payment of instalment of loan, rather they paid instalment even afterclosing the mill, that the respondent paid a total amount of Taka 5,08,620.00against the capital finance as well as working capital up to December, 1987.The respondent further submits that the suit is premature as the plaintiff hasbrought the suit much earlier than and long before the expiry of the loanperiod maturity, and loan recovery period and as such the suit is liable to bedismissed on this count alone. It is further submitted that if the bank had notbrought the suit the respondents could have repaid the entire amount by runningthe mill. The respondents further contended that they had to close down themill because of non-cooperation of the appellant bank and due to bringing thesuit before the maturity of the loan in violation of the terms of the IDAcircular Vide SID circular No.7 dated 23-2-1981, etc.</p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p><p style="text-align:justify">8. The plaintiff has examined one Abul Kasem Chowdhury, SeniorOfficer, Sonali Bank, Feni, as P.W. 1 to prove their case and the defendantNo.2 Md. Haroon, the proprietor of the defendant No. 1 Rana Oil Mill, hasexamined himself as a lone defence witness to prove the defence case. Theappellant bank has also produced some documents and admitted those intoevidence and marked exhibits.</p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p><p style="text-align:justify">9. We have perused the pleadings and the evidence of the case andexamined the exhibits. The fact admitted as appeared from the evidence of boththe plaintiff and the defendants as well as from the exhibits are that,pursuant to a development credit agreement signed between the Government ofBangladesh and the IDA on 17th October, 1980 on 3rd IDA credit for an amount ofUS$ 35 million for the development of Small Scale and Cottage Industries inBangladesh a circular being SID Circular No.7 dated 23-2-1981 was issued forpublic notification. The plaintiff-appellant bank was one of the designateddisbursing banks of the said IDA credit along with Janata Bank, Agrani Bank andBangladesh Shilpa Bank. Bangladesh Bank, acted as a guarantee organisation aswell as refinancer. In the circular it was mentioned that;</p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p><p style="text-align:justify">‘The credit will be admissible to cover 70% of the cost of theeligible project to be newly set up—Finance may be admissible to cover up to80% of the cost in exceptional cases for loans not exceeding Taka 5,00,000.00.The project sponsor must have their own resources adequate to subscribe to therequired equity.”</p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p><p style="text-align:justify">In paragraph 8 of the circular the period of loan has been laid down;</p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p><p style="text-align:justify">“8. (a) Maximum maturity for the loan under capital finance may beupto 12 years including grace period of 2 to 3 years.</p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p><p style="text-align:justify">(b) Maturity period for working capital and transport loans will be upto 5 years including grace period”.</p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p><p style="text-align:justify">In paragraph 9 of the circular the rate of interest on the loan hasbeen fixed at 13% per annum to be applied semi annually in June and Decembereach year.</p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p><p style="text-align:justify">10. On this notification and in terms of discussion with theplaintiff-bank and on their hope and assurance, the defendants had filed theloan application/project profile for their project under the aforesaid IDAcredit, in the prescribed form to the Sonali Bank, made for IDA financeproject. The appellant-Bank after preparing a feasibility report by their owncommittee found the application eligible for advancing the loan under thecredit and ultimately advanced Taka 7 lac as capital finance and Taka 2,70,000.00 as working capital from IDA credit fund. It is also admitted that thedefendant had already spent Taka 10 lac for land development, construction ofbuilding, etc. The bank disbursed Taka 4,50,000.00 on 14th February, 1984, Taka1,49,000.00 (as price for transformer) on 12th March, 1984 and the balance ofTaka 1 lac on 4th April, 1984 totaling about Taka 7,00,000.00 of the aforesaidcapital finance, and disbursed Taka 2,00,000.00 on 9th August, 1984, and Taka70,000.00 on 13th August, 1984 totaling Taka 2,70,000.00 of the aforesaidworking capital from IDA fund. The respondent No. 2 admittedly received theaforesaid amount and set up the mill and put the mill into operation in August,1984. It may be mentioned here that, the approved cost of the project assanctioned by the appellant Bank was Taka 24,57, 920.00 out of which the bankadmittedly paid only 35% half of the amount (70%) stipulated in the aforesaidcircular. It is further admitted by both the parties that cash credit limit ofTaka 3 lac came to nil balance and fully adjusted on 13-9-86. The mill wasclose down on September, 1986, a legal notice was issued by the bank on therespondents on 8-12-86 and the suit was brought on 3-6-90. This is alsoadmitted that on account of Capital Finance and working Capital the defendabtalready paid Taka 5, 08,620.00. This is further evidence that theplaintiff-bank has brought the suit within six years of disbursement of theloan instead of 12 years as mentioned in the IDA circular as quoted above andeven before the expiry of the own period of loan of 7 years as mentioned in thesanction letter Exhibit 1 of the plaintiff-appellant itself.</p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p><p style="text-align:justify">11. This is a clear deviation and violation of both IDA circular aswell as own terms of contract (Sanction letter Exhibit 1) of the plaintiff,distinctly resulting in breach of contract by the plaintiff.</p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p><p style="text-align:justify">12. It appears from the deposition of D.W.1 that he was facingfinancial crisis in running the mill and so he asked the bank for fresh loan ofTaka 15 lac against his previous mortgaged properties and Taka 10 lac againsthypothecation. He claimed that the properties worth Taka 42 lac was alreadymortgaged by him and his wife to the bank at the time of accepting the sanctionletter for a loan of Taka 9,70,000.00 only. Hence the bank could easily paythem further loan as requested against the said mortgaged security but the bankdid not do it. D.W.1 further stated that which is admitted by the bank as wellas by Exhibit 7 Gha i.e. the Bank statement that the cash credit limit of Taka3 lac came to nil, balance on 13-9-86. The D.W.1 asserts that the bank couldhave immediately advanced a fresh running capital loan against the same cashcredit but the bank did not do it, instead enhanced the limit to Taka 4 lac6(six) months after. As a result he had closed down the mill. It appears fromthe records of the case that though the defendants have defaulted in making thepayment of instalment in and did not block any amount or defaulted to pay anytime but he paid instalment deliberately. The learned Advocate for therespondents submits that as per normal banking and commercial practice such adeparture in paying the instalments on due time is a normal matter, more so, incase of industrial loan, and for that reason a specific period for recovery ofloan is stipulated in the agreement/sanction letter of the bank executed withthe respondents. The maturity of the loan for recovery in the present case was12 years of the disbursement of 1st instalment of the loan as per terms of theIDA credit and as per terms of the sanction letter Exhibit 1 it was 7 years.But the plaintiff has brought the suit only after six years after thedisbursement of first instalment of the loan which is long before the maturityof the loan in both the cases as aforesaid. In view of the facts, evidence andmaterials on record of the case, we are inclined to accept the aforesaidsubmissions of the learned Advocate for the respondents that due to non-cooperationof the plaintiff (Bank) the defendants had to shut down the mill for which theysuffered huge capital loss, as contended by him.</p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p><p style="text-align:justify">13. We also find substance in the submission of the learned Advocatefor the respondents that the suit was premature and was filed long before thematurity/expiry of the loan period. In the circular in paragraph 8 under theheading, ‘Period Of The Loan’ we find the words. ‘Maximum maturity for the loanunder capital finance may be up to 12 years including grace period, Maturityperiod for working capital and transport loans will be upto 5 years includinggrace period. In the sanction letter Exhibit 1 itself, the appellant-bank hasreduced the said period unilaterally and in breach of IDA circular, to 7 yearsincluding 12 months as grace period for capital finance and 4.5 years including6 months as grace period for working capital. Although this reduced period asmentioned in the sanction letter Exhibit 1 is contrary to and in breach of thecircular, this period of 7 years binds the bank for the plaintiff itself is thematter of the contract, Exhibit 1 for taking action for recovery of loan. Butwe find that the 1st instalment of the IDA loan of the capital loan wasdisbursed in February 1984 and this suit for recovery of the loan has beenfiled in June, 1990 which is clearly only after about 6 years of disbursementand long before the expiry of the period for which the loan was granted even asper terms of the bank’s own sanction letter.</p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p><p style="text-align:justify">14. The learned Advocate for the appellant-bank contends that theinstalments of repayment of the capital finance was to start from the 18thmonth of the date of first disbursement of the loan and the defendant havingfailed to pay the instalment in time they became a defaulter. The learned Advocatefurther contends that the defendant failed to pay their instalments both of IDAloan as well as against the cash credit loan and as they could not furnish anyfresh mortgage, the bank could not rely on them to grant them additional freshloan of Taka 15 lac, as the bank is not a philanthropic organisation but apublic commercial unit having deposits from the public at large. But we findfrom the own condition of the bank as contained in the sanction letter, asmentioned above, that the period of loan was 7 years for capital finance and4.5 years for working capital and that the repayment will start from 18 monthsof the date of first disbursement of the loan. We therefore, hold that the suitfiled by the appellant bank is premature and against their own terms ofcontract, vis-a-vis against the term of IDA circular No. 7 dated 23-2-8 1, asaforesaid, hence the suit is not maintainable and is liable to be dismissed.</p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p><p style="text-align:justify">15. We are also not unmindful to the default terms contained in thesanction letter which says that if the (a) Borrower failed to make interestpayment as required. (b) Borrower fails to make payment of principal asrequired, the bank may call back the loan with all accrued interest thereon,immediately due and payable. It reveals that, the bank ‘may’ call back theloan, as aforesaid. It is to be noted that the word ‘may’ has been used in thedefault term making the step to be taken in such situation as discretionary andnot to be followed rigidly except in extreme cases. If we examine the facts injuxtaposition, we find that the respondents have had already made a payment ofTaka 5,08,620.00 to the plaintiff towards repayments of overdue instalments ofIDA loan of both capital finance and working capital. The respondents paid asum of Taka 3,41,942.00 against capital finance and Taka 1,66,678,00.00 againstworking capital by December, 30, 1987. The cash credit limit of Taka 3 lac wasalso fully adjusted and the balance sheet of the account came at nil balance on13-9-87. This cash credit limit was, however, enhanced to Taka 4 lac but thebank took away Taka 1,44,000.00 from this account to adjust overdue arrear ofthe IDA credit which they cannot do, but did it illegally. The cash creditlimit account is completely a different loan account from IDA loan account.Cash credit limit loan has been advanced by the bank from its own fund underseparate contracts with much higher rate of interest @16% with penal interestup to 20%. So having deducted this good amount of Taka 1, 44,000.00 from cashcredit limit to adjust IDA instalment illegally, the plaintiff pushed therespondent to further hardship in running the mill. However, in view ofaforesaid payment we cannot term the respondents a defaulter in the strictsense of the term. On the other hand, the above bears the testimony of bonafide, sincerity and honesty of the respondents, who by then, have had alreadypaid about half of the loan money of both the IDA credit and of the bank. Thefacts further show that, in anticipation of receiving IDA loan up to 70% tocover the cost of the new project and on the assurance of the plaintiff, therespondent No. 2 admittedly has had already spent a sum of Taka 10 lac towardsthe project, but he was paid only 35%, the half, which drastically put him toacute financial crisis. He requested for additional loans to bank, but for thisreason or that, the plaintiff refused it. The bona fide and sincerity of therespondents further reveals from the facts that, they got the IDA loan inFebruary, 1984 and they put the mill into operation in August, 1984 promptly,which shows that the respondents could run the mill hardly for about 2 yearshaving closed it in September, 1986 for running capital constraint. Theplaintiff-appellant, instead of helping running the mill in spite of having alltheir properties worth Taka 42 lac mortgaged with them vis-a-vis the building,machineries, spares, equipment, stores, etc, hypothecated to the bank, as wellas audit report of the bank favourable to the mill and the recommendation ofthe higher officers of the plaintiff to grant loan to the mill, the plaintiffserved legal notice on 8-12-86 to the respondents calling back the entireamount of both IDA and cash credit loans with interest and ultimately filed theSuit of 3-6-90, before the stipulated maturity and expiry of the loan period.The respondents thus got no breathing time in either running the mill or torepay the instalments in time in spite of their best and sincere effortsevidenced from the materials on record. We also do not find that the appellantproduced any evidence to prove that the respondents transferred the loan moneyto different head as alleged by them. The plaintiff has submitted that, had therespondent No.2 not filed the Money suit for compensation against the plaintiff,the bank would not have filed this suit. This submission of the appellantcannot be accepted since it reflects the malafide motive of the plaintiff aswell. This is contrary to the terms of the IDA credit and to the terms of theplaintiffs one. This submission of the appellant also supports the stoutassertion of the respondents that, this suit was filed to take revenge and toretaliate against them for their filing the Money Suit for compensation againstthe bank.</p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p><p style="text-align:justify">16. We have already found that the suit is instituted by the plaintiffappellant is premature and is liable to be dismissed. But the question arosewhether we can dismiss the suit when no appeal or objection has been filed bythe defendant respondents. It appears that under Order 41 rule 33 of the Codeof Civil Procedure this Court has ample power to pass any decree or order evenwhere the respondent has not, filed any appeal or cross-objection.</p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p><p style="text-align:justify">17.

It appears from rule 33 as quoted above, this court can pass adecree or order which ought to have been passed or made as the case may requireand this power may be exercised by the court not withstanding the fact that thedefendant-respondent before us has not filed any appeal or objection.
