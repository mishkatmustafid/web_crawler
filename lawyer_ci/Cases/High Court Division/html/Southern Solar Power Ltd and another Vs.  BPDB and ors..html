Section 3 of the Arbitration Act makes a general statement about the ‘scope’ of application of the provisions of Arbitration Act. The Legislature by engraving the word ‘scope’ in the marginal note of Section 3 of the Arbitration Act sought to mean that while the provisions of this law shall be mandatorily applied to ‘domestic arbitration’, ‘international commercial arbitration’ which would take place in Bangladesh and execution of the award passed by the foreign arbitral tribunal as provided in Sections 45, 46 &amp; 47, the provisions of the Arbitration Act may also be applied for foreign arbitration, if the parties to the foreign arbitration in their arbitration agreement makes such stipulation. There is apparently no mentioning about conferring or ousting of the jurisdiction of the High Court Division or the Court in Section 3 of the Arbitration Act. Section 3 of the Arbitration Act is a general statement about the ‘scope’ of applicability of the provisions of the Arbitration Act for ‘the arbitration’; it does not make any statement about the functions or jurisdiction of the Court. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">                                   </span>...36, 37 and 56</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> </span></span></u></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Arbitration Act (I of 2001)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Sections 7, 7A, 10, 12, 14(4), 20, 21(4), 42, 44, 45, 48 and 50<u></u></span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Jurisdiction of the Courts in arbitration matters: </span></u></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">‘</span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman Bold',serif;">Parties to the arbitration’ are barred by the provisions of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act to file any legal proceeding in any Court. However, there is permissive space for ‘the parties to the arbitration’ to file legal proceedings, about which the Arbitration Act makes provisions to approach the Courts. The legal proceedings permitted by the Arbitration Act are; (i) application under Section 7A for obtaining interim order, (ii) application under Section 10 for referring the dispute to the arbitration tribunal and thereby stay the proceedings in the Court, (iii) application under Section 12 for appointment of arbitral tribunal, (iv) application under Section 20 before the High Court Division for determining the jurisdiction of arbitral tribunal, (v) application under Section 21(4) before the District Court for enforcement of an interim order passed by the tribunal, (vi) application under Section 42 for setting aside arbitral award, (vii) application under Sections 44 and 45 before the District Court for enforcement of domestic arbitral award and foreign arbitral award respectively (viii) appeals under Sections 14(4) and 48 before the High Court Division and (ix) application under Section 50 before the District Court for arbitrators’ remuneration. It is the Section 7 of the Arbitration Act which deals with the issues of jurisdiction of the Courts. The position of Section 7 is superior than other provisions of the Arbitration Act and other laws and till now it retains its aforesaid superiority, except in the case of passing the injunction Order, preservation Order and other interim/interlocutory Orders enumerated in clauses (a) to (g) of Section 7A(1) of the Arbitration Act. </span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">         </span>...39 and 56</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> </span></span></u></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Arbitration Act (I of 2001)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Sections 7A and 45<u></u></span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Whether this Court is competent to pass any interim Order where the arbitration is being or would be held outside Bangladesh: </span></u></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Since in sub-Section (1) of this newly inserted Section 7A, the Legislature has employed the expression “<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">until enforcement of the award under Section 45”</em>, therefore, an interim Order may be passed by the High Court Division to help the foreign tribunal till the time a foreign arbitral award is enforced. In other words, in case of a foreign arbitration, from the time of initiation of an international commercial arbitration (foreign arbitration) up to the period of enforcement of the award passed by the foreign arbitration tribunal, the High Court Division is competent to pass any interim Order centering around the said foreign arbitration. Provisions of Section 7A of the Arbitration Act being supernal, this newly inserted provision extended the jurisdiction of the Courts of Bangladesh investing the power of issuance of injunction Order, preservation Order and other interim Orders not only for the arbitrations taking place in Bangladesh, but also for the foreign arbitrations by clearly stating that “<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 7…… until enforcement of the award under Section 45……. the High Court Division…….. may pass Order</em>”. ...43 and 56</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Words and phrases</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">‘Per incurium’<u></u></span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">When any Judgment is passed by any Court in ignorance of the applicable laws either because of forgetfulness of the Hon’ble author Judge or due to ill-information about the applicable laws by the learned Advocate/s or for not making the relevant laws available before the Court, the decision should be held to have been given <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">per incuriam</em> and, consequently, it would not have legal force to bind the Courts to follow and apply the<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"> ratio</em> laid down therein. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">                                                               </span>...56</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> </span></span></u></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Interpretation of statute<u></u></span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Cardinal principles of statutory interpretation:</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">If there is no ambiguity in the words employed by the Legislature in any Act of Parliament, no attempt should be made to give any meaning other than its literal meaning, and when one provision of an Act of Parliament would appear to be inconsistent with the other provision of the same Act of Parliament, the Court’s duty is to provide a harmonious interpretation on the touchstone of the Preamble and other provisions of the Act, so that none of the provisions turns out to be useless or nugatory. ...56</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> </span></span></u></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Words and Phrases</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>“Bank Guarantee” <u></u></span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">A Bank Guarantee is an undertaking given by a Bank to pay an amount on demand to the named beneficiary.

The Courts should not grant an Order of injunction to restrain the realization of a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit. The rationale behind it is that a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit is an independent and a separate contract and is absolute in nature and, thus, the existence of any dispute between the parties to the contract is not a ground for issuing an Order of injunction to restrain enforcement of a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit and, secondly, stoppage of encashment of an unconditional Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">the party concerned (beneficiary of the Bank Guarantee or the LC). Only if there is clear allegation of committing fraud in preparation of a </span>Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit, having vitiated the very foundation of such a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit, the Court may interfere into the matter by passing an Order of injunction. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">      </span>...64</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Arbitration Act (I of 2001)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Section 7A</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>It appears that at the time of approaching this Court, the petitioners were in the process of formation of arbitration tribunal in Hong Kong as per the terms of the arbitration agreement, and since there was an apprehension by the petitioners that before the arbitral tribunal is composed, the respondents may terminate the PPA and IA and encash the Bank Guarantee, this Court having found a <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">prima facie</em> case and balance of inconvenience in favour of the petitioners, passed an ad interim Order of injunction. Now, after hearing the learned Advocates for both the sides, it appears to this Court that the cardinal principles for granting temporary injunction apparently exist in this case and, therefore, I am of the view that the petitioners deserve to be remedied with a preventive relief for a specified time, in order to preserve the subject in controversy, namely, the PPA and the IA without determining any question of right. Accordingly, the respondents are restrained from terminating the Power Purchase Agreement (Contract No. 10144) and the Implementation Agreement both dated 09.01.2017 for 60 (sixty) days from the date of receipt of this Order towards allowing the petitioner to seek any interim Order, including the preservation Order/injunction Order, from the foreign arbitral tribunal which, as per admission of both the parties, is in seisin of the matter.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">    </span>...57 &amp; 58</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; tab-stops: right 210.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">HRC Shipping Limited Vs.

The company is established by its promoter, the petitioner no. 2, in order to carry out the works of development of a 200MW (AC) Grid Tied Solar Park on Build-Own-Operate (BOO) basis for 20 years at Teknaf, Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh (“Project”). On 06.10.2014 the petitioner no. 2 submitted an unsolicited proposal to the respondent no. 3 (the Secretary, Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources) who along with respondent no. 1 (Bangladesh Power Development Board) (BPDB), approved the said proposal. Thereafter, the respondent no. 1 issued a Letter of Intent (LOI) on 21.10.2015 to the petitioner no. 2, who on 25.10.2015 accepted the LOI. Then, the petitioner no. 2 incorporated the petitioner no. 1 in Bangladesh in the year 2016 to implement the project. The estimated investment for the project was US$300 million and once built, it would be the biggest ever solar-based electricity generation plant in Bangladesh. As per the terms of the LOI, the company then submitted a performance security deposit through Bank Guarantee No. 11011000106 dated 13.11.2016 (“Bank Guarantee”) issued by Bank Asia Ltd, a scheduled Bank in Bangladesh (proforma respondent no. 5) for an amount of USD 10,00,000.00 (USD one million) to the respondent no. 2 (Secretary of the BPDB). The respondent no. 1 represented by the respondent no. 2 thereafter executed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) on 09.01.2017 with the company with a view to authorizing the petitioner to initiate construction of the Project. It is stated that, under the terms of the PPA, the company is under obligation to complete the construction of the project within 18 months from the signing of the PPA and when the company was ready to initiate the construction works of the project at Teknaf, Cox’s-Bazar, upon obtaining all the financial supports from the financiers, it experienced extreme difficulty in progressing with the project, because a massive number of Rohingyas took refuge around the project area at Teknaf, Cox’s Bazar, and eventually when the company realized that it would not be possible to complete the construction of the project within the timeline stipulated in the PPA, on 05.10.2017 the company informed the respondent no. 2 of force majeure events with a request to grant an extension for 12 months of all the project related milestones. Thereafter, instead of granting an extension to the company, the respondent no. 2 issued a “BPDB Notice of Default” on 15.10.2017 upon the company informing that it has failed to achieve the ‘Financial Closing’ and this resulted in a “Company Event of Default”.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">It is stated that thereafter the parties sat together on various times to discuss how to mitigate the problem and continue with the PPA. The company even attempted to search for new land all around Bangladesh and conducted various feasibility studies. However, it could not manage any other suitable properties within such short period. The company at all material times kept the respondent no. 1 informed about its activities in various progress update meetings held with the respondent no. 1. Instead of acknowledging such diligent exercises and efforts of the company, the respondents issued a “Notice of Intent to Terminate” dated 05.04.2018 upon the company informing that it has failed to cure the default. Thereafter, the respondent no. 2 requested the company on 26.04.2018 to extend the tenure of the Bank Guarantee and, accordingly, the company extended the tenure of the Bank Guarantee till 12.05.2019. On 22.05.2018, the company submitted its reply to the respondent no. 2’s “Notice of Intent to Terminate” having stated the reasons for its failure to make progress and requested the respondent no. 2 to schedule an official site visit to understand the gravity of the problem. However, when the respondent nos. 1 and 2 neither made any response to such reply dated 22.05.2018 of the company, nor did they arrange any site visit to the project area to understand the matter, the company again sent a letter dated 06.06.2018 to the respondent no. 2 requesting it to extend the time period of the project and also to allow the petitioners to change the location of the project site, but the respondent nos. 1 and 2 did not make any response to such request of the company. Finding no other alternative, the foreign lawyer of the company, Squire Patton Boggs, issued a notice of dispute dated 02.07.2018 upon the respondent no. 2 having requested to arrange a consultation meeting between the parties so that the parties can attempt, in good faith, to settle the dispute within 30 days of the date of the said letter. Upon receiving no response from the respondents, the aforesaid foreign lawyer of the company issued another notice dated 01.08.2018 upon the respondent no. 2 informing it that the company had nominated Mr. Ismael Guerrero and requested the respondents to appoint its representative so that they can sit together and settle the dispute with a cautionary note that if the dispute is not resolved by the referral to CEO by 16.08.2018, then the company will have no choice but to refer the dispute for arbitration. Since the respondents did not co-operate and/or try to resolve the dispute, the company felt that the arbitration is the ultimate solution for resolving the dispute, and since the company is under the apprehension that the respondents may terminate the PPA &amp; the IA at any time and encash the Bank Guarantee in course of processing the arbitration, the respondents are required to be restrained by way of an interim injunction from wrongfully terminating the PPA &amp; the IA and encashing the Bank Guarantee. Hence, the petitioners have approached this Court.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 0in left 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">   </span>The respondent nos. 1 &amp; 2 (BPDB) and the respondent no. 4 (Power Grid Company of Bangladesh) by filing affidavits contested this case. Their common contentions are that the PPA was signed on the understanding that the company shall finance, build, own and operate a 200MW Grid Tied Solar Park for a period of 20 years at Teknaf, Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh and subsequently sell to the respondent no. 1 (BPDB) electricity from the project on a “no electricity - no payment” basis. If the petitioner fails to achieve “Financial Closing” by the “Required Financial Closing Date” of 08.10.2017, which was the date nine months from the effective date of the PPA, it shall constitute an “Event of Default”. A key component of the company’s obligations for the implementation of the project was the acquisition of land for the “Site” in Teknaf, Cox’s Bazar at its own cost and initiative. This requirement was set out in the project approval dated 15.10.2015 and in the PPA and IA. By mid-August 2017, it was apparent that the company would not be able to achieve Financial Closing by 08.10.2017 or commercial operation by the required commercial operation date of 08.07.2018. Rather than conceding its impeding breaches, the company opportunistically seized upon the humanitarian assistance that Bangladesh provided to the Rohingya minority group fleeing from Myanmar to make a last minute claim of force majeure. It is stated that the company did not claim the presence of the Rohingya as a Political or Force Majeure Event until October 2017, just a few days before it was to miss the required ‘Financial Closing Date’. On 15.10.2017, by written notice the respondent no. 1 informed the company that it had failed to achieve Financial Closing by 08.10.2017 deadline, constituting an “Event of Default” and, therefore, exercised its contractual remedy to issue a “Notice of Default”. On 22.10.2017, a committee tasked with investigating the project status conducted a site visit and prepared a report containing that while the project required at least 600 acres, the company had submitted agreements for the intended sale and purchase of only 43 acres and there are no displaced persons at the designated site. On 12.12.2017, the respondent no. 1 informed the company that there was no existence of Rohingya adjacent to the project area and thus refused the company’s request for extension of the implementation period. Since the company could not take any corrective steps to cure the “Event of Default”, the respondent no. 1 issued a ‘Notice of Intent to Terminate’ on 05.04.2018. Over one month after the ‘Notice of Intent to Terminate’ was sent to the company, on 22.05.2018 the respondent no. 1 wrote that an alleged ongoing Force Majeure or Political Event had affected its ability to further the project at the designated project site and sought for relocation of the project site. On 06.06.2018, the company wrote to the respondent no. 1 requesting a change in the project site along with a prayer for extension to complete the project. On 01.07.2018, the respondent no. 1 rejected the company’s request to relocate. The very next day, on 02.07.2018, the company issued a Notice of Dispute and after a few days, the company filed the present arbitration application under Section 7A of the Arbitration Act and obtained an interim Order of injunction. Thereafter, when the company as the claimant filed ICC Arbitration Case No. 23904/TO against the respondent no. 1 before the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), the respondent no. 1 filed its Written Reply and Counterclaim on 26.12.2018, and, now the entire matter is pending before the arbitral tribunal in Hong Kong.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">5.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud, the learned Senior Advocate for the petitioner, at the very outset seeks this Court’s permission to denominate the terminology ‘Section’ employed in the PPA as “the Terms &amp; Conditions” for avoiding confusion with the ‘Section’ of the Act of Parliament which would be used in making his submissions.

In a bid to buttress up his argument on the issue of the maintainability of this application on the ground of seat of arbitration being outside Bangladesh, he submits that not a single word has been employed by the Legislature prohibiting this Court to entertain application if the seat of arbitration is outside Bangladesh. He submits that Section 3 of the Arbitration Act is a mere permissive provision, not a prohibitive provision inasmuch as while the provision states about application of the Arbitration Act for the arbitration to be held in Bangladesh, it does not contain any express wordings making this Court incompetent to deal with the arbitration which will take place outside Bangladesh.

Mr. Alam submits that although the company was not competent to raise the issue of force majeure event in the manner as has been adopted by the company by writing a usual letter to the respondents about the matter only 10 (ten) days before the Financial Closing, nevertheless, after issuance of the Notice of Default, when the company expressed their desire to sit with the respondents, the respondents responded to their call and sat together and after having discussion with the company when the respondents found out that the company is not in a position to achieve Financial Closing by 08.10.2017 towards commencing the commercial operation of the project, only then, the respondents as per the provision of T&amp;C of the PPA proceeded towards issuance of “Notice of Intent to Terminate the PPA”. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 0in left 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">13.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">   </span>By referring to the T&amp;C No. 19.4(h) of the PPA, he submits that since the parties agreed in the PPA not to initiate any proceedings or to file any action/suit in any Court of competent jurisdiction or before any judicial or other authority arising under, out of, in connection with or relating to the PPA, whether or not any such dispute has been referred to arbitration under T&amp;C No. 19.4(a), and since the arbitration is to be conducted at the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre in Hong Kong as per the ICC Rules, the company by purposefully violating the law, has filed this application knowing fully well that this Court is not competent to pass the interim Order of injunction.

But the courts did not look very favourably on a practice which tended to diminish their jurisdiction; and when they were asked to enforce the awards made by arbitrators against recalcitrant parties to an arbitration, they got many opportunities of laying down rules as to the conditions of the validity of these awards, as to the modes of entering them, and as to the conduct of arbitrators, which, at the end of the medieval period, were beginning to make the law as to arbitrators a very technical and not a very reasonable body of law. Its complexity was increased in the succeeding centuries; and, though some of the less reasonable medieval rules were eliminated, it became more elaborate and remained very technical, whilst the growing complexity in the law of pleading made it increasingly difficult to be sure that a disputed award would be enforced. In 1698 the Legislature made a salutary change in the law as to the method of entering awards, but it was not till the legislation of the 19th century that the manifold complexities and irrational technicalities of the common law as to arbitration were reformed, and the law assumed its modern form." </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">24.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The people of this part of the world (sub-continent) are acquainted with the concept of arbitration from time immemorial. In good old days, disputes between private individuals used to be placed before ‘Shalish’, ‘Panchas’ and ‘Panchayats’. Likewise, commercial matters were decided by ‘Mahajans’ and ‘Chambers’. Formal arbitration proceedings, however, had come into existence after the Britishers started commercial activities in India. The provisions relating to arbitration were found in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1859 (CPC) and, then, in subsequent CPCs. Protracted, time-consuming, atrociously expensive and complex Court-procedures impelled the commercial world to an alternative, less formal, more effective and speedy mode of resolution of disputes by Judges of choice of the parties which culminated into passing of an Arbitration Act. A full-fledged law pertaining to arbitration in India was the Arbitration Act, 1899. Thereafter, in order to cope with the burgeoning issues relating to arbitration, an amended law was passed in 1940, known as the Arbitration Act, 1940. Experience, however, belied expectations. Proceedings became highly technical and thoroughly complicated. The provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1940 made 'lawyers laugh and litigants weep'. Observations were being made inside/outside the Courts to amend the law by making it more responsive to contemporary requirements. Moreover, apart from arbitration, conciliation has been getting momentum and worldwide recognition as an effective instrument of settlement of disputes. There was no composite statute dealing with all matters relating to arbitration and conciliation. The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) adopted a Model Law in 1985 on International Commercial Arbitration. The General Assembly of the United Nations recommended its member-States to give due consideration to the Model Law to have uniformity in arbitration procedure which resulted in passing of the Arbitration Act, 2001.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">25.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The intent of the Legislature has vividly been couched in the Preamble of the Act, 2001, which reads as follows:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: 'Times New Roman Bold',serif;"> </span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: 'Times New Roman Bold',serif;">An Act to enact the law relating to international commercial arbitration, recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral award and other arbitrations.</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">26.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">From a plain perusal of the Preamble, it is my understanding that by enactment of the Arbitration Act, 2001, the Legislature sought to make a perfect law of arbitration, containing both the substantive and procedural provisions, upon consolidating and amending the law relating to domestic arbitration, international commercial arbitration, arbitration tribunal, arbitral award, foreign arbitral tribunal, foreign arbitral award and enforcement of domestic as well as foreign arbitral awards. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">27.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">While the expression ‘domestic arbitration’ can be easily understood from its literal meaning that it is a form of the ADR where one or more persons are appointed to hear a case that takes place within one jurisdiction, the meaning of other expressions, namely, arbitration tribunal, arbitral award, international commercial arbitration, foreign arbitral tribunal, foreign arbitral award and enforcement of domestic as well as foreign arbitral awards, have been codified in different sub-Sections of Section 2 of the Arbitration Act.

Section 3 of the Arbitration Act makes a general statement about the ‘scope’ of application of the provisions of Arbitration Act. My humble understanding about the provisions of in Section 3 of the Arbitration Act is that since there is no prohibitory wordings to apply the provisions of the Arbitration Act for the foreign arbitration and foreign arbitral tribunal, nor is there any statement to the effect that the provisions of the Arbitration Act shall ‘only’ be applicable in case of ‘international commercial arbitration’ taking place in Bangladesh, the relevant provisions of the Arbitration Act may be borrowed and applied by the foreign arbitral tribunal, if the parties of the arbitration so agree. And our High Court Division may also apply the necessary provisions of the Arbitration Act for the foreign arbitration such as, Sections 7A and 10 in addition to the provisions of Sections 45 to 47 of the Arbitration Act. In other words, while ‘the foreign arbitration tribunal’ is free to observe, follow and apply our law, our High Court Division may use the relevant provisions of the Arbitration Act, namely, Sections 7A and 10 on top of applying the provisions of Sections 45 to 47, in an arbitration which would take place or is being held in a foreign country, for, the wordings of Section 3 of the Arbitration Act do not seek to oust the jurisdiction of the High Court Division in relation to an arbitration proceeding where the place of arbitration is outside Bangladesh. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">35.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The Legislature by engraving the word ‘scope’ in the marginal note of Section 3 of the Arbitration Act sought to mean that while the provisions of this law shall be mandatorily applied to ‘domestic arbitration’, ‘international commercial arbitration’ which would take place in Bangladesh and execution of the award passed by the foreign arbitral tribunal as provided in Sections 45, 46 &amp; 47, the provisions of the Arbitration Act may also be applied for foreign arbitration, if the parties to the foreign arbitration in their arbitration agreement makes such stipulation. Thus, clearly this Section is about the ‘arbitration’, and it does not seek to state anything about the business or role of the ‘Court’, as evident from the Bengali wordings </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: SutonnyMJ; mso-bidi-font-family: Mangal;">ÕD³ mvwj‡ki ‡ÿ‡ÎÕ</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> (for the said ‘arbitration’) as occurs in Section 3 of the Arbitration Act. So, it is crystal clear that the aforesaid ‘limitation’ is meant for mandatory application of the provisions of the Arbitration Act for arbitration, arbitrators, arbitration proceedings, arbitration award, arbitration tribunal; the limitation is in no way meant to be applicable for the Courts. In other words, the provisions of this Act are enacted by the Parliament having aimed at governing the different provisions starting from making of the ‘arbitration agreement’ right up to the end of arbitration, which include initiation of arbitration, appointment of arbitrators, constitution of arbitration tribunal, arbitral award and its execution. Section 3 seeks to state that the provisions of the Arbitration Act are the guidelines for arbitration; i.e. for arbitration tribunal (not for Courts), within Bangladesh territory, as the foreign arbitration tribunals are formed and their businesses are conducted as per the laws of the foreign countries or international bodies, such as ICC and other International Commercial Chambers/forum. Thus, there is apparently no mentioning about conferring or ousting of the jurisdiction of the High Court Division or the Court in Section 3 of the Arbitration Act.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">36.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">With the above conclusion, I have to search for the provisions which confer or limit the jurisdiction of the Courts in arbitration matters, and I find Section 7 of the Arbitration Act to be such a provision.

Section 7 of the Arbitration Act seeks to oust ‘any other law’, and since the Legislature has employed the word ‘shall’ in the expressions ‘no judicial authority shall hear any legal proceedings’, the provisions of Section 7 is to be applied by the Courts mandatorily. So, it means that ‘parties to the arbitration’ are barred by the provisions of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act to file any legal proceeding in any Court. However, there is permissive space for ‘the parties to the arbitration’ to file legal proceedings, about which the Arbitration Act makes provisions to approach the Courts. The legal proceedings permitted by the Arbitration Act are; (i) application under Section 7A for obtaining interim order, (ii) application under Section 10 for referring the dispute to the arbitration tribunal and thereby stay the proceedings in the Court, (iii) application under Section 12 for appointment of arbitral tribunal, (iv) application under Section 20 before the High Court Division for determining the jurisdiction of arbitral tribunal, (v) application under Section 21(4) before the District Court for enforcement of an interim order passed by the tribunal, (vi) application under Section 42 for setting aside arbitral award, (vii) application under Sections 44 and 45 before the District Court for enforcement of domestic arbitral award and foreign arbitral award respectively (viii) appeal under Section 48 before the High Court Division and (ix) application under Section 50 before the District Court for arbitrators’ remuneration. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">38.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Now, if the provisions of the Preamble, Sections 2(c), 2(k), 3, 7, 10, 42 and 45 of the Arbitration Act is read concurrently, it would be found that the Legislature’s intention was to endow the people of this country with a complete code relating to both types of arbitration matters, namely, ‘domestic arbitration’ and ‘international commercial arbitration’/‘foreign arbitration’, with as much provisions as they could comprehend at the time of enactment of the law. However, the irony is that the Legislature’s effort of providing a full code on arbitration matters subsequently surfaced to still be a bit incomplete, for, while Section 45 of the Arbitration Act in clearer terms states that the award of the foreign arbitration would be enforced in Bangladesh subject to fulfillment of certain conditions, it apparently overlooked to mention that ‘international commercial arbitration’ held outside Bangladesh (i.e. the foreign arbitration) shall also enjoy the benefit of enactment of this latest Act, particularly (i) in dealing with interim Orders and (ii) for keeping in abeyance any litigation during pendency of any foreign arbitration regarding the same dispute. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">39.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The apparent complete code of Arbitration Act, 2001 triggered multifarious interpretations on Sections 3, 10 and 12 of the Arbitration Act because of having several ambiguities with regard to ‘international commercial arbitration’.

The Legislature in this newly incorporated provision not only enlisted the matters in which the Courts are competent to pass the interim Order/s, it also did not forget to arm the Courts with the ‘power’ which are usually available to the Courts in dealing with the interim/interlocutory Oder/s, as evident from the provision of sub-Section (2) of Section 7A of the Arbitration Act. The Legislature also did not overlook to mention the purpose of empowering the Courts in passing the interim Order/s, by specifically stating that in order to keep the interim measures intact, the Courts will have the mastery of passing interim Order/s without even hearing the other parties, if the situation permits, as can be understood from the Proviso to sub-Section (3) of Section 7A of the Arbitration Act. And, by incorporating the provision of sub-Section (4) of Section 7A of the Arbitration Act, the Legislature vested a superior class of power in the Courts by spelling out that, where the arbitration tribunal is either powerless or has failed to exercise its power to pass any interim Orders, the Courts shall have the dominion to pass the necessary Order/s. The Legislature, then, by incorporation of sub-Section (6) of the Section 7A of the Arbitration Act makes it clear that power of the Courts in passing the interim Order/s are vested in the Courts to help/assist the arbitration tribunal, meaning that the provisions of Section 7A have been inserted in the Arbitration Act in aid of the arbitration tribunal, not to disturb the functions of the arbitration tribunal.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">41.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The above examen of Section 7A of the Arbitration Act leads me to find out whether this Court is competent to exercise the above powers in a scenario where the seat of arbitration is outside Bangladesh. In other words, whether this Court is competent to pass an interim Order to assist a foreign arbitration tribunal. In quest for the answer, I went through the provisions of Section 7A of the Arbitration Act line by line and it appears to me that since in sub-Section (1) of this newly inserted Section 7A, the Legislature has employed the expression “<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">until enforcement of the award under Section 45”</em>, therefore, an interim Order may be passed by the High Court Division to help the foreign tribunal till the time a foreign arbitral award is enforced. In other words, in case of a foreign arbitration, from the time of initiation of an international commercial arbitration (foreign arbitration) up to the period of enforcement of the award passed by the foreign arbitration tribunal, the High Court Division is competent to pass any interim Order centering around the said foreign arbitration. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">42.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">After the above explorations on the scheme of the Arbitration Act, 2001 in tandem with the origin of arbitration, definitions of domestic arbitration, foreign arbitration, foreign arbitral award, functions to be performed by the Courts in a foreign arbitration matter, I should now examine the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ratio</em> laid down by this Court in the cases referred to, and relied on, by the parties of this matter.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraph"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">43.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Let me, at first, advert to the case-laws referred to by the learned Advocates for the petitioners. In the case of Bangladesh Air Service (Pvt.) Ltd Vs British Airways PLC 17 BLD (AD) 249, there was a stipulation in the contract that any dispute between the parties shall be resolved through the law of arbitration of England (Arbitration Act, 1950). However, when the Bangladeshi-party approached the Civil Court of Bangladesh for appointment of an arbitrator, the British-party questioned the jurisdiction of the Bangladeshi-Court to appoint an arbitrator. After hearing, the trial Court held that the jurisdiction of the Court was not ousted, but the High Court Division by exercising its revisional jurisdiction set aside the trial Court’s Order holding that the Courts in Bangladesh have no jurisdiction over an arbitration which is agreed by the parties to be held outside Bangladesh, and the same was upheld by the Appellate Division by an illuminating Judgment authored by his Lordship Justice Mustafa Kamal upon a masterly analysis of all the available case laws of the period. Upon reading the entire Judgment, I find that this Judgment was delivered on 08.05.1997, when the Arbitration Act, 2001 was not enacted and, secondly, revealed that the learned Advocate for the petitioners, by merely quoting a few lines from Paragraph 23 of the Judgment, is endeavouring to make out a favourable case. The Appellate Division had granted leave in the said case on four grounds, and the No. 1 ground was whether the High Court Division failed to consider the true import of Exception 1 to Section 28 of the Contract Act, 1872. In dealing with this ground, at first, the Hon’ble Appellate Division embarked on the question of ‘proper law of contract’, which was raised by the learned Amicus Curie as an ancillary point, as evident in Paragraphs 14 to 18 of this reported case and, then, examined the No. 1 ground which is imprinted in Paragraphs 19 to 24. In paragraph 23 of this case, the Apex Court observed that since any party to an arbitration is free to file a Damage Suit, the local Courts retain the jurisdiction to decide the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">lis</em> between the parties and, in that circumstance, the defendant would also be entitled to seek stay of the suit. I find that neither the aforesaid observations made in Para 23 do help the petitioners, nor the overall <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ratio</em> laid down by the Apex Court in this case nor the ultimate result of the case do assist the petitioners in any manner.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">44.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In the case of HRC Shipping Ltd Vs MV X-press Manaslu and other 12 MLR (HC) 265 (2007), when the plaintiff (HRC Shipping Ltd) filed an Admiralty Suit for payment of compensation for loss of cargo and containers, the defendant nos. 5 &amp; 6 (MV X-press Manaslu and Sea Consortium Pvt.

In my opinion, since the factual and legal issues of this cited case are different from that of the present case, the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ratio</em> laid down in the cited case is not strictly applicable here in this case. However, since this cited case was decided on 30.06.2006 which is well after incorporation of Section 7A on 24.01.2004 in the Arbitration Act, and since the applicability of the provisions of the Arbitration Act was raised before the Court, the Court could have undertaken the surgery of the newly inserted provisions of Section 7A(1) of the Arbitration Act by which the Legislature categorically ousted the provisions of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act towards enabling the parties to a foreign arbitration to apply for interim Order/s of any nature before the High Court Division of Bangladesh Supreme Court at any time before the foreign arbitral award comes to an end through its execution, in substantiating its reasoning in favour of applicability of the provisions of the Arbitration Act with an analogy that when the parties to a foreign arbitration have been authorized to invoke at least one provision (such as, Section 7A of the Arbitration Act) of the Arbitration Act in specific terms, the objection as to applicability of other provisions of the Arbitration Act, including the provision of Section 10 of the Arbitration Act, gets repelled.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">45.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In the case of KA Lalif Vs Olam International 13 BLC 457, the application under Section 7A of the Arbitration Act was disposed of keeping the sale-proceeds in the custody of the Registrar of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh so that following disposal of the foreign arbitration, it can be used.

The most significant feature of Section 7A of the Arbitration Act is that by coming into effect on 19.02.2004, it removed the limited nature of applicability of the provisions of the Arbitration Act, as was prevalent in Section 7 of the Arbitration Act, by heralding that the non-obstante clause of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act would no longer be in operation. Given the status of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act that it is the provision by which jurisdiction of the Courts regarding arbitration matters have been conferred upon the Courts, albeit only for dealing with the limited issues, having dictated the Courts not to hear any case regarding arbitration, except for the causes enunciated in the Arbitration Act, my view is that incorporation of Section 7A in the Arbitration Act by the Legislature on 24.01.2004 has obviously changed the jurisdictional footing of the Courts. More importantly, all the above-referred cases were decided without taking into consideration the expression “<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 7……… until enforcement of the award under Section 45 ……. the High Court Division …….. may pass Order</em>”, which is engraved in Section 7A(1) of the Arbitration Act.

The provisions of Sections 7A and 10 of the Arbitration Act may be applied by the High Court Division to foreign arbitration at its discretion in order to assist/help the foreign arbitration proceedings. In other words, the Preamble, Sections 2(c), 2(k), 7, 7A(1) and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>10 authorise the High Court Division to pass necessary Order/s for the purpose of furthering, not to weakening, the foreign arbitration. However, during pendency of foreign arbitration, the High Court Division should not exercise this discretionary power if it appears that passing any Order would cause disturbance to the performance of the functions of the foreign arbitration tribunal. The High Court Division must not take it as an usual duty when it would be dealing with the applications under Sections 7A and 10 of the Arbitration Act in a foreign arbitration scenario. Only upon strictly and meticulously carrying out the need and usefulness of the interference of the High Court Division in cases of foreign arbitration, it should pass the necessary Order. Such as, in a Section-7A application, if the situation is that the foreign arbitral tribunal is yet to be composed of or it lacks required power or the foreign arbitral tribunal cannot be constituted quickly, in the aforesaid situations, for saving the arbitration from becoming a “hollow formality” i.e. in order to protect/secure the subject matter of the arbitration, a discretion may be exercised by the High Court Division so as to restrain the parties from irreversibly altering <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">status quo</em> of the subject matter before the arbitrators are able to render a decision. Similarly, in a Section-10 application, if the High Court Division is <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ex-facie</em> satisfied that due to the multifarious litigations pending in the Court and arbitration pending in the foreign arbitration tribunal, ultimately the decisions of both the forums (Courts and foreign arbitral tribunal) shall be rendered useless, the High Court Division may in appropriate cases exercise its discretion under Section 10 of the Arbitration Act. In other words, for foreign arbitration matters, towards making the said arbitration meaningful and effective, the High Court Division may allow applications under Sections 7A and 10 of the Arbitration Act.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: -.25in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">7.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The Legislature may consider to add the following expressions <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">“Provisions of Sections 7A and 10 may be applied for foreign arbitrations by the High Court Division on its satisfaction as to exigencies and usefulness of issuance of the order/s prayed for”</em> at the bottom of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act, either as a ‘Proviso’ or as an “Explanation” taking into consideration that this Court has been spending its invaluable time in interpreting the applicability of the provisions of the Arbitration Act in a foreign arbitration scenario, sometimes expressing its opinion in favour of the application of the Arbitration Act for foreign arbitration and, on some occasions, opining against its applicability for the foreign arbitration.

Since it was the intention of the framers of the Constitution to see the Supreme Court of Bangladesh as the Guardian of the Constitution, this Court owes a duty to assist the Legislature by pointing out the lacunae and loopholes of the laws of this country whenever any such laws would be referred to before this Court. While the Court merely expresses its views, it remains open for the Legislature to enact/amend the laws accordingly or to ignore them. When this Court carries out the above exercise, it should not be seen as transgression by the Judiciary into the domain of the Legislature. The position of the UK’s Constitution being completely different from our Constitution, the observations made by the UK-Judiciary are not applicable in our jurisdiction. The Judiciary of the UK is not constitutionally allowed to make any comments on the Acts of Parliament, let alone declaring them void.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: -.25in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">8.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Taking into consideration the cardinal principle of interpretation of law that if there is no ambiguity in the words employed by the Legislature in any Act of Parliament, no attempt should be made to give any meaning other than its literal meaning, and when one provision of an Act of Parliament would appear to be inconsistent with the other provision of the same Act of Parliament, the Court’s duty is to provide a harmonious interpretation on the touchstone of the Preamble and other provisions of the Act, so that none of the provisions turns out to be useless or nugatory. All that I wish to say in summing up my views is that, in the backdrop of embodiment of the clear-cut wordings “<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 7…… until enforcement of the award under Section 45……. the High Court Division…….. may pass Order</em>” in Section 7A(1) of the Arbitration Act, this Court should not be hesitant to issue appropriate necessary interim Order/s for foreign arbitration matter.

Rather, it that would seek to harmonise with all the provisions of the Arbitration Act on top of saving the above-quoted provisions of Section 7A(1) of the Arbitration Act from rendering nugatory.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .75in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">56.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Thus, from the above threadbare all-out scrutiny on the issue of the applicability of the provisions of the Arbitration Act to a foreign arbitration, the irresistible conclusion that derives is that this Court is well competent to entertain an application under Section 7A of the Arbitration Act regarding an arbitration which would take place or is taking place in a foreign country and, therefore, I hold that the present application is maintainable, from the view point of the applicability of the provisions of the Arbitration Act in a foreign arbitration scenario. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">57.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The above resolution on the first count of maintainability issue of this case, namely, whether this Court can hear an application under Section 7A of the Arbitration Act if arbitration takes place outside Bangladesh, leads me to embark upon the second count of maintainability issue, namely, whether this Court is competent to issue an Order of Injunction restraining the Bank or beneficiary from encashing a Bank Guarantee.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">58.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In order to deal with the issue, let me first know what is a Bank Guarantee.

Therefore, there is no room for making out a <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">prima facie</em> case by the petitioners in favour of non-encashment of the said Bank Guarantee. Regarding preventive measures through the Courts by issuance of different types of injunction Orders in the sub-continent, including our jurisdiction, the relevant laws are Sections 52 to 57 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 (shortly, SR Act) and Order 39, Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (CPC). The paramount requirements of the above legal provisions are that the applicant must satisfy the Court that (i) there is an arguable <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">prima facie</em> case, (ii) balance of inconvenience is in favour of the applicant and (iii) the applicant shall suffer irreparable loss and injury not commensurable in monetary terms unless the other party is restrained. The above principles have been laid down not only by the legal luminaries of the jurisdiction of the sub-continent, but also by many of the finest jurists of the world. Lord Diplock in the case of American Cynamid Co. Vs Ethicon Ltd H.L. (E) 1975 A.C 396 has articulated the aforesaid principles in the following eloquent words;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">“The object of the interlocutory injunction is to protect the plaintiff against injury by the violation of his right for which he could not be adequately compensated in damages recoverable in the action if the uncertainty were resolved in his favour at the trial; but the plaintiff’s need for such protection must be weighed against the corresponding need of the defendant to be protected against injury resulting from his having been prevented from exercising his own legal right for which he could not be adequately compensated under the plaintiff’s undertaking in damages if the uncertainty were resolved in the defendant’s favour at the trial.

Nonetheless, to briefly put on record as to whether the aforesaid two requirements do exist in this case, I find from the fact that if the petitioners succeed in the arbitration and, consequently, they are allowed to proceed with the PPA and IA, the company shall not be required to submit another Bank Guarantee in favour of the respondents on top of claiming damage, if the company suffers any. Moreover, at the end of hearing when this Court expressed its opinion that it is the settled law of our jurisdiction that payment of Bank Guarantee cannot be stopped by the Order of injunction, it was contended by the petitioners’ learned Advocate Mr. Md. Anisul Hassan that the petitioners are not worried about the Bank Guarantee, rather the concern of the petitioners is with regard to preservation of the PPA and the IA. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">62.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In a catena of case-laws of our jurisdiction, it has been observed that no order of injunction can be passed by the Courts to stop payment of Bank Guarantee or Letter of Credit. From the reading of the said case-laws, I find that when an unconditional Bank Guarantee or Letter of Credit is given or accepted, the beneficiary is entitled to realize such a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit in terms thereof irrespective of any pending disputes relating to the terms of the contract, and the Bank giving such guarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms irrespective of any dispute raised by its customer. The Courts should not grant an Order of injunction to restrain the realization of a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit. The rationale behind it is that a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit is an independent and a separate contract and is absolute in nature and, thus, the existence of any dispute between the parties to the contract is not a ground for issuing an Order of injunction to restrain enforcement of a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit and, secondly, stoppage of encashment of an unconditional Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">the party concerned (beneficiary of the Bank Guarantee or the LC). Only if there is clear allegation of committing fraud in preparation of a </span>Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit, having vitiated the very foundation of such a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit, the Court may interfere into the matter by passing an Order of injunction. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">63.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Since the issue as to whether an order of injunction can be issued for stopping the payment of an irrevocable Bank Guarantee was examined time and again by the Courts of all the jurisdictions and it is the unanimous decision of all the Courts of the world that payment of an irrevocable Bank Guarantee and a Letter of Credit cannot be prevented by the Courts unless any one comes out with an egregious allegation of committing fraud in the documents/papers of a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit, the bottom line, as appears to me, is that enforcement of an "On Demand Bank Guarantee" in terms thereof is not subject to judicial interference on the basis of the terms of the contract. Since in this case, evidently, the Bank Guarantee is an ‘On Demand Bank Guarantee’, this application is not maintainable, so far as it relates to the prayer for encashing of the Bank Guarantee.
