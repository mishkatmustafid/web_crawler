Khorshed Ali, son of late Md. Abdul Motaleb of village 12/A, Kumarpara, Ward No.18, Kotwali police station under Sylhet District lodged the First Information Report (FIR) with Kotwali Model Police Station before the Officer-in-Charge on 30.11.2010contending <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">inter alia</em> that the informant is the proprietor of Hotel Anurag situated at Dhupa dighir Uttarpar of Sylhet town and he was an immigrant of United Kingdom. Due to his old age with different diseases he returned back to this country and as a proprietor of the above mentioned Hotel started the same. The further case of the informant is such that his son the victim of this case, Atiqur Rahman @ Atique used to reside in London and prior to three years of the occurrence, the informant asked him to come back and the deceased Atiqur Rahman @ Atique after his return to this country was entrusted to supervise and manage the Hotel ‘Anurag’. The deceased Atiqur Rahman @ Atique got him introduced with the condemned-convict Shafiqur Rahman Shafiq through one Mosharaff, a businessman of Latif Centre, Sylhet. The condemned-convict Shafiqur Rahman was a businessman of VCD and DVD and he used to sale the same to the deceased Atiqur Rahman and that the condemned-convict Shafique used to come to the deceased very often and stayed in his hotel as a boarder. On 23.11.2010 the convict Shafiqur Rahman hired the room No.322 of that hotel, identifying him as a son of one Hajee Rahmat Ullah and Shahebjadi Begum and he stayed there untill the date of occurrence i.e. up to 29.11.2010. On the date of occurrence at about 3.00 p.m. at the request of the convict Shafiqur Rahman the deceased Atiqur Rahman @ Atique returned back to the hotel Anurag and went to the room No.322. After some time of his arrival in the said place of occurrence room, the convict Shafiqur Rahman and his two accomplices while where leaving the hotel, the Managers of that Hotel namely Salauddin and Shahabuddin asked the convict Shafiqur Rahman and his two accomplices as to where they are going. In reply to that, they told to the Managers that, for collecting money from S.A. Paribahan they are going outside. Subsequently, the General Manager of the hotel namely Mahmuduzzaman Jewel finding the mobile phone of the deceased Atiqur Rahman stopped, along with 4/5 employees of that hotel started to look after Atiqur Rahman, who was their junior boss and at a stage of searching, they went in front of room No.322 and hearing sound of water falling inside the said room No.322 which was under lock and key, with the help of duplicate key of the room opened the room and found the deceased Atiqur Rahman @ Atique fastened by a rope in his legs, hands, neck and waist and the mouth of the deceased Atique at that time was closed by a scotch tape. Finding that condition of the deceased Atique, the General Manager told the driver of the deceased namely Alamgir to bring the informant Hajee Md. Khorshed Ali from his residence. The General Manager informed the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and police requesting them to come to the place of occurrence. Subsequently, the informant along with his wife and the deceased’s wife coming to the hotel found the victim Atiqur Rahman @ Atique in the aforesaid condition and became senseless. After some time, the members of RAB and police force coming to the place of occurrence found the deceased and the police seized a Tiger Energy drink bottle from the place of occurrence room having some poisonous substance therein. They also seized some CD and VCD which were scattered inside the room. The mobile phone set and money bag of the deceased were missing, but the wristwatch of the deceased was on the floor of that room. The further case of the informant is such that the body of his son Atique was sent to Sylhet Osmani Medical College Hospital, from where he was declared ‘dead’. Subsequently, the condemned-convict Shafiqur Rahman @ Shafique made a mobile phone call from his mobile phone No. ‘0175206307’ to other mobile phone of the deceased Atique at 01.20 a.m. being No. ‘01746065732’ and that phone call was received by the paternal father-in-law of the deceased namely Badrul Islam. The convict Shafiqur Rahman by that phone call wanted to know the condition of Atique, disclosing his identity as a friend of Atique. The phone number which was used by the condemned-convict Sofique was known to the hotel boy Mizan, inasmuch as in that phone number prior to the occurrence Sofique requested the hotel boy Mizan on different occasions to give flexi load from outside of the hotel.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">5.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">            </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Subsequently, after getting First Information Report, investigation was started by the concerned Kotwali Police Station, Sylhet and one Sub-Inspector Md.

Aminul Islam, the learned Deputy Attorney General (hereinafter DAG) submits that the FIR of the case was lodged on 30.11.2010 at 22.10 hours andthe date of occurrence was 29.11.2010 and the time of occurrence was between 3.04 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. The place of occurrence was Hotel Anurag, 2<sup>nd</sup> Floor, Room No.322. The learned DAG further submits that after proper investigation of the case police submitted charge sheet under section 302/34 of the Penal Code on 18.06.2011. The charge was framed by the learned Metropolitan Sessions Judge, on 11.09.2012 and out of 31 charge-sheeted witnesses, 17 witnesses were examined by the prosecution, those who have successfully proved the case of the prosecution beyond all reasonable doubt. There is an extra-judicial confession, in this case and about this confession, the prosecution witness No.2, 11, 12 and 13 testified before the Court. The learned DAG also submits that the principal accused of this case is the condemned-convict Shafiqur Rahman @ Shafique, who has confessed his guilt under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and clearly implicated the other co-accused of this case as of his two accomplices in the occurrence of killing the victim Atiqur Rahman @ Atique. The learned DAG argued that the Managers of the hotel Anurag, the prosecution witness No.3 and 7 categorically in their testimony testified that they have seen the convict persons and the prosecution case was totally corroborated by the witnesses including the managers. The learned DAG submits that the investigating officers of the case had no necessity to produce any witness to identify the assailants through T.I. parade, since there is a clear(distinct) video footage of the accused persons which was in the close circuit camera of the Hotel Anurag and that video footage was seized by the investigating officer and preserved, from where it is apparent that the two accomplice of the principal accused Shafique were accompanied by Shafique at the time of occurrence. The learned DAG submits that, without any mental or physical torture, fear or threat after the apprehension the condemned-convict Shafiqur Rahman @ Shafique, when he(Shafique) wanted to confess his guilt, he was produced before the learned Magistrate, 1<sup>st</sup> Class and the learned Magistrate complying the provisions of law properly, recorded the confessional statement of the condemned-convict Shafique under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and it is from the confessional statement itself that for reflection, three hours time was given to the convict Shafique before his 164 statement and as such there is nothing to discard the confessional statement of the condemned-convict Shafique. The learned DAG lastly submits that the prosecution witness No.2 Alamgir, who is the driver of the deceased as well as the informant, is a very important witness of this case, who is competent enough to corroborate the prosecution case. The Assistant Manager of Hotel Anurag the witness No.3 is also an important witness and the witness No.2, 3 7 and 10 are the direct ocular witnesses, who has witnessed the convicted persons to leave the place of occurrence immediately after the occurrence. The witness No.11 of the prosecution is also an important witness, who has talked with the condemned-convict over telephone after the occurrence. The witness No.12 and 13 are the witnesses of extra-judicial confession and the inquest report of the deceased which was immediately after the occurrence at 16.45 hours of the date of occurrence and has clearly corroborated the injuries which were found in the dead body of the deceased Atique. From the contents of this report it is crystal clear that there is no subsequent embellishment and the FIR is very much consistent with the inquest report and postmortem report of the deceased, wherefrom it is clear that there was a distinct mark of strangulation and that the link of the occurrence has been well proved from the evidences on record and it is also well proved that it was a preplanned cool-blooded murder, since the rope which was used in tiding in the neck of the victim was brought by the assailant Shafiqur Rahman @ Shafique prior to the occurrence from outside. The learned DAG in support of his contention has referred a decision of this Court reported in 55 DLR 116 and relying upon the said decision in his concluding submission submits that the prosecution has successfully discharged their onus of proof<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>by sufficient competent tangible and credible evidence and it is also proved that prior to the confession of the principal accused Shafique before the learned Magistrate, (P.W.16, Mr. Shahabuddin Masum) there was no torture, threat or provocation to him by anybody including the police and therefore, the judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed by the learned Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Sylhet should be upheld.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">15.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">As against the aforesaid argument, Mrs. Hasna Begum, the learned Advocate appearing as State Defence lawyer in support of the defence submits that, against the condemned-convict Shafiqur Rahman @ Shafique in the instant case there is no eye witness in support of the prosecution case and there is no T.I. parade by which the assailants of the occurrence were identified. The learned State Defence Advocate further submits that there is no pre-meditation of the condemned-convict Shafique prior to the occurrence and there are several contradictions among the witnesses, who were examined in support of the prosecution case. The learned State Defence counsel lastly submits that the confessional statement of the condemned-convict Shafique is not true and voluntary and it was not properly recorded by the learned Magistrate and the driver of the informant namely Alamgir, who was examined as prosecution witness No.2 admittedly has no appointment letter and as such the evidence of the driver cannot be relied on and there is no paper relating to business relationship of the deceased with the condemned-convict Shafiqur Rahman @ Shafique and as such the Death Reference is liable to be rejected.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">16.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">In respect of the Criminal Appeal filed on behalf of the convict-appellant Sumon @ Mama Sumon, none appeared to make any submission at the time of hearing despite; the matter has been posted in the daily cause list of this bench for days together with name of the learned Advocate for the appellant. </span></p><p class="MsoListParagraph"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">17.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">In view of the argument advanced from both the sides, let us now scan the evidence adduced from the side of the prosecution and cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses including other evidence of this case.

It appears that the confession has not been vitiated by any illegality. Besides, this Court in the case of <em>Abul Hossain –vs.- State</em>, 46 DLR 77 opined that the provisions under sections 164 and 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure are mandatory and required to be strictly followed to make the confession voluntary and true and fit for reliance for convicting the accused on his confession. In the case of <em>Nausher Ali Sarder –Vs.- The State</em>, 39 DLR (AD) 194, their lordships held that the surrounding circumstances are ordinarily the only material from which the inference of a confession may be drawn.
