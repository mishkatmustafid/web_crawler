The retraction of the confession is wholly immaterial once it is found voluntary as well as true. In a case of pre-planned murder, confession of co-accused can also be used as evidence against other accused in view of the fact that a perpetrator is considered to be an agent of his associates in carrying out the object of the plan and anything said, done or written by him during the continuance of the conspiracy in furtherance of common intention of the perpetrator is a relevant fact against each of his associates, for the purpose of proving the conspiracy as well as for showing that he was a party to it.

Whereas, it has revealed from the arguments by the defence lawyers and also evidence that guardians of convicts are seemed to be highly educated doing everyday task at their respective work-places, therefore, it may be important to note here that some people express their views stating that it is the only duty of the guardians to look after those students who are not properly conducting their deeds as expected by the society. This sense of care may be partially true in consideration of primary education at the hands of the guardians at home as they are the only teachers at the beginning of their child growth and that is why, all parents should encourage their children to different books as it can prevent them from slipping into a wrong path. Children can be prevented from heading down the wrong path only by getting them involved in good environment and also family atmosphere. [I] “Children whose fathers embrace parenthood are less likely to be troubled as they approach their teens,’’ UK based researchers said. An Oxford University study finds that [II] “fathers who were emotionally committed and felt confident about parenthood in the first few months had better-behaved children 11 years later”. The amount of time the father spent with the child or got involved in domestic chores was not as significant as these two factors. At the same time everyone including the State has to think about the environment, pure education and politics, lesser growth of population, awareness of accurate historical background of independence of the country and religious harmony with proper knowledge. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%;">124.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">    </span></span></strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%;">People like us always think about their children to be genius and great within a short span of time to enjoy the lives with aristocracy.

Yes, there may have some minor mistakes in recording the confessional statements of the accused persons but it appears from order sheets of lower court’s records that the recording magistrates described details in their orders how and when the confessing accused were brought before them and made confessions as well.

Even then, recording magistrates rendered them reasonable time to think that if they confess it may go against them as evidence.

The retraction of the confession is wholly immaterial once it is found voluntary as well as true. In a case of pre-planned murder, confession of co-accused can also be used as evidence against other accused in view of the fact that a perpetrator is considered to be an agent of his associates in carrying out the object of the plan and anything said, done or written by him during the continuance of the conspiracy in furtherance of common intention of the perpetrator is a relevant fact against each of his associates, for the purpose of proving the conspiracy as well as for showing that he was a party to it. To sustain a charge under section 34 of the Penal Code, pre-concert is a necessary ingredient. Existence of such pre-concert can be established even by proof of acts performed by individual after the completion of main crime [Ghulam Quadir –Vs- State 12 DLR (SC) 171]. The above confessing accused by their individual acts rendered prompting the mission to be executed as per plan initially organized by absconding accused Rana who after being inspired by the speeches of Imam Rahmani took the other perpetrators to the alleged mosque to be inspired for killing the person who allegedly defamed Islam and Prophet Hazrat Mohammad [S].     </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">135.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">    </span></span></strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">In the case in hand it is found that all the confessions have been corroborated by circumstantial evidence provided by the witnesses. It appears from their confessions that they firstly made plan at the instigation of absconding accused Rana being inspired by the speeches of Imam [accused Sykhul Hadis Mufti Mohammad Jashim Uddin Rahmani] and all of them got prepared dividing into two groups to locate the person whom they intended to kill and finally they liquidated him forever. On a plain reading of their confessions it is clearly found that they made the confessions involving themselves in the commission of offence. So, there is no doubt that the confessions made by the accused persons are found to be inculpatory in nature. The confessions are so natural and spontaneous that one cannot harbor any doubt about its voluntariness. When a confession is found to be true and voluntary and inculpatory in nature without corroborating evidence a conviction can be imposed upon the maker of the statement. It finds support from the case of Mofti Abdul Hannan Munshi @ Abul Kalam and another–Vs-the State, judgment dated 7<sup>th</sup> December, 2016 reported in 2017(1)LNJ (AD)38 in which the Apex Court opined that “Even if there is no corroborative evidence, if a confession is taken to be true, voluntary in nature, a conviction can be given against the maker of the statement relying upon it subject to the condition mentioned above. In view of the above proposition of law, there is no legal ground to interfere with the conviction of the appellants and co-accused since the confessions are not only inculpatory but also true and voluntary. Deliberate and voluntary confession of guilt, if clearly proved, are among the most effectual proofs in the law-their value depending on the sound presumption that a rational being will not make admission prejudicial to his interest and safety, unless when urged by the promptings of truth and conscience.”</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 107%; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">In the said Mufti Hannan’s case, although recording magistrates of confessional statements of the accused were examined but a hard copy of a confessional statement of accused Mufti Hannan has been submitted and exhibited in the case bringing from another case in which the accused made confession disclosing his involvement by supplying grenades in the crime committed by his <span style="letter-spacing: 0.3pt;">cohorts, conviction sustained by the Apex Court against him but in the case in hand, all confessional statements have been duly </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;">exhibited and the recording magistrates </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt;">have also been thoroughly examined as to the </span>confessions made by the accused persons in respect of their guilt. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 109%;">136.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">    </span></span></strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 109%;">When a confession is proved against the confessing accused it can be taken into consideration against co-perpetrator in the same crime as the required formalities have been duly observed by the recording officer. Accused Rana was not arrested by police in this case but from the confessions of six accused persons it reveals that he was involved in planning and killing of the victim and he had direct participation in the attack of the victim at the scene, if planning and killing considered as a whole or separately from each other it has emerged that Rana has been found everywhere as disclosed by six confessional statements that he made the plan collecting information from face book and subsequently took preparation and also led the other accused persons in the commission of offence. He was absconded from the very beginning till his arrest [when the hearing of the death reference was concluded]. From seizure list dated 03.03.2013, marked as exhibit-07 it appears that some articles were recovered from his house by police when he went into hiding. For the sake of argument, if anyone thinks that due to police harassment he had gone into hiding and that be so why did he not appear in court before or after the trial of the case. Could he say that he was not aware of the crime allegedly committed by him with others? Record also shows that before putting him on trial in absentia all requirements were met as per provision of the law, and regarding this case many more news were published in the electronic and print media at home and abroad. This also supports by the evidence of pw-34 who recorded and seized some articles including Jihadi books from his house on 03.03.2013 at 20:45 hours. Section 30 of the Evidence Act also find support to hold him guilty of the offence as disclosed by the said circumstantial evidence and this fact also clearly proves for his involvement in the entire preparation and execution of the victim. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">137.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">    </span></span></strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">Although absconding by itself has no fault as it may be due to apprehension of police harassment but hiding with the guilty knowledge will be an offence and it can be used against the absconder.

Absconsion by itself is not an incriminating matter, for, even an innocent person, if implicated in the ejahar for a serious crime, sometimes absconds to avoid harassment during investigation by the police. But in some cases a person with guilty knowledge also absconds. It is the facts and circumstances of the case which decide whether the absconsion is due to any guilty knowledge or to any intention to avoid police harassment.

The main investigator of this case also did not depose any single line of evidence in his deposition that he had gone through the books, seized by him during investigation of the case. It is also argued by the defence that the investigators did not place the call list by which they started investigating the case and found the involvement of the accused persons in the commission of offence. Even then, they did not think to hold T.I parade for connecting the accused persons with the crime and what transactions the offenders made by using alleged laptops recovered from their respective houses, have not been disclosed by the investigating officers and they also failed to recover so called cricket ball, cricket bate and bicycle rather they could do one thing that displayed accused persons physically before the electronic media during investigation of the case in the name of press conference which is not at all permissible in law of the land. It may hamper the investigation of an offence by the remarks of the commentators, if made. It is further contended that the investigating officer took the five accused persons on a seven days police remand by the order of the court on 02.03.2015 but produced them for recording their confessions on 10.03.2015 beyond his jurisdiction. He could not retain them in his custody even after day of 08.03.2015 for a single moment and as such the confessions allegedly made by the said five accused are absolutely questionable. </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">140.<span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-feature-settings: normal; font-language-override: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-synthesis: weight style; font-variant: normal;">    </span></span></strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 110%;">Since the investigators are found to be senior most officers in the case they ought to have shared their experiences in the case properly.

These arguments advanced by the learned defence lawyers have prompted us to go into the findings of the trial court’s judgment wherein the learned trial judge also expressed almost same views as advanced by the defence. We know that, to develop experiences you need to become a little bit wiser, bolder and older. This principle has been discovered and used since long but it is not properly applied in an important event unfortunately.
