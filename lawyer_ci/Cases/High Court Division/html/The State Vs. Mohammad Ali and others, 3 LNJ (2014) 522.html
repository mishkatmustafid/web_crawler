In view of language used in this section, any </strong><strong>vague or indefinite or incomplete information,</strong><strong> even if it relates to a cognizable offence, cannot be an information to be treated as an FIR. It cannot be a universal dogma that the information in respect of commission of a cognizable offence first in point of time to the Police Station is always must be an FIR and if it is taken as a matter of fact it will be risky and suicidal for the administration of criminal justice. Thus we find that the FIR lodged by PW 1, the father of deceased knowing the fact from the witnesses who were present in the scene of the occurrence was rightly treated as FIR by the Court below. . . .(67 and 70)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)</strong><br/><strong>Section 154</strong><br/><strong>When any father losses his only beloved son like the deceased, it is very much natural and probable that he will be shocked and perplexed as it could be. So, it cannot be the top most priority of filing an FIR than that of the burial function of the deceased by a father. Moreso, immediate after occurrence PW 1 became also sick for the shock which he received due to the murder of his only son. So, in this particular case though the FIR was lodged after almost 22 hours but that cannot be considered as an inordinate delay in the above facts and circumstances of the case it cannot be considered that delay was caused intentionally in order to concoct the prosecution case. . . .(73)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I ov 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 3</strong><br/><strong>Mere relationship of the witnesses with the deceased or informant cannot be the only ground to discard the  evidence of such witnesses if they are not found biased in deposing the Court. In this particular case the ocular witness PW 2 is not a relation of the deceased though he is a man of informant’s camp for the same politics of BNP and though PWs 3 and 8 are the cousins of the deceased, but in the facts and circumstances of the case it led us to hold that they are the most natural, probable and competent witnesses of the occurrence as the situation, the time of occurrence and the place of occurrence provides their presence in the place of occurrence and there appears no biasness, emotion and falsity in their evidence. . . . (84)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 8</strong><br/><strong>The 4 witnesses were cross-examined by the defence extensively as to the means of recognition. But their evidences has not been shaken away in any way rather the evidence of PWs 2,3,8 and 13 as to the means of recognition is very much consistent and corroborative with one another. So, considering the consistent and credible evidence of P.Ws. 2,3,8 and 13 that they had seen the accused in the light of </strong><strong>electricity available in the place of occurrence</strong><strong> cannot be thrown away. . . . (93)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Penal Code (XLV of 1860)</strong><br/><strong>Section 34</strong><br/><strong>The reason for making more than one accused guilty under the provisions of section 34 of the Penal Code as the very presence of co-accused gives encouragement, support and protection to the person actually committing an act. It may so happen that without the support of the co-accused who did nothing other than standing on the scene with the master mind offender, he would not be able to hit the victim without the support of the co-accused. In this particular case it was not possible on the part of accused Mohammad Ali alone to cause a pistol shot on the ear of deceased Shafiq without the support, encouragement and protection of his other accomplice co-accused that is why all the accused persons who remaining present in the scene of occurrence had given support, encouragement and protection to the principal accused in committing the crime of murder of Shafiq is held liable under section 34 of the Penal Code. . . . (100)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)</strong><br/><strong>Section 376</strong><br/><strong>As condemned prisoners Jewel alias Jahirul Haque, Akter Hossain son of Alimuddin, Abul Bashar alias Badsha and Shahin have been languishing in the condemned cell for a quite long time with a mental agony of death by hanging along with their tender age appears to us as extenuating circumstances to commute their sentence from death to </strong><strong>imprisonment for life. But the said extenuating</strong><strong> circumstances is not available to those of the convicts Mohammad Ali and Tipu who are still fugitive from the justice. . . .

Shafiqul Islam, a young man of 26 year was the Vice President of Rupganj Thana Chatrodal and at the same time a businessman who on 08.11.2005 at 6 P.M. to attend an informal meeting of Chatrodal had gone to Vulta under Rupganj Police Station along with Kamal and Monir Hossain by his private car being no. Dhaka Metro-Ma-00-0354 and at 6.30 PM he having been at Vulta had parked his car in front of Babul confectionary at the northern side of Vulta round square at Dhaka-Sylhet high way. He had attended the meeting at Chatrodal office at Awal market of Vulta leaving his accompanying members Kamal and Monir Hossain at Babul confectionary.

Shafiqul Islam who sustaining the said pistol shot fell down on the earth. Monir and Kamal tried to come to the deceased but for incriminate gun shot of accused Jewel, Tipu, Akter Hossain, Badsaha Miah and Shaheen could not reach to him. Witness Ripon, Mahbub, Kaiyum and Badsha also tried to come to the deceased from the baby taxi stand adjacent to the round square but the accused also resisted them on gun shot. One Jahangir tried to nab accused Mohammad Ali but the said Mohammad Ali had threatened him of fire. Accused Mohammad Ali, Jewel, Tipu, Akter Hossain, Badsha Miah and Shaheen riding on a yellow coloured taxi cab from in front of Gausia market had left the place of occurrence for Narshingdhi. The other accused also had left the place of occurrence towards south direction. Witnesses Monir, Kamal, Jahangir and others had shifted critical Shafiqul to Vulta General Hospital where the Doctor declared him dead. Mofizuddin Bhuiyan, the father of the deceased being informed of the occurrence having been at Vulta Genereral Hospital found the dead body of his son. The witnesses told the occurrence to him and on the following day the dead body of deceased Md. Shafiqul Islam was buried and thereafter informant Mofizuddin Bhuiyan lodged the FIR with Rupganj Police Station through his cousin Mohammad Ali and accordingly Rupganj Police Station Case no. 9 dated 09.11.2005 corresponding to G.R. Case no. 516 of 3005 were started.<br/><br/>The case was investigated by PW 37 Police Sub-Inspector Md. Habibur Rahman who at the initial stage of the investigation prepared inquest report on the cadaver of deceased and sent the dead body to the morgue for post mortem examination, seized the alamats of the case, examined the witnesses and recorded their statements and after completion of the investigation submitted police report under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code recommending the trial of 19 accused named in the police report. After submitting the police report the case record was sent to the Sessions Judge, Narayanganj for trial where the case was registered as Session Case no. 370 of 2006 where the accused were invited to answer the charges under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code to which accused Aslam Bhuiyan, Abul Bashar alias Badsha, Syed Hossain, Akter Hossain alias Akter, Abdur Rab alias Rouf, Ayiub Hossain, Akter Hossain alias SDU, Nur Mohammad alias Nura and Mukul alias Mokbul Hossain pleaded their not guilty claimed to be tried. On the date of framing charge accused Mohammad Ali, Jewel alias Jahidul Haq, Tipu, Shaheen, Mobarak Hossain, Kamal, Jalil Miah, Jahirul Islam, Jahangir and Abdul Hye were fugitive from justice as such their answer on the charge could not be recorded but to defend the absconding accused, state defense lawyer was appointed accordingly.<br/><br/>After examining the PW 1 by the Sessions Judge, Narayanganj the case was transferred in the Druta Bichar Tribunal no.1, Dhaka where the case was registered as Druta Bichar Tribunal Case no. 11 of 2006 on 19-06-2006. At trial the prosecution examined 37 witnesses in all but the defence examined none. After completion of the oral evidence accused Akter Hossain alias Akter son of Alim Uddin, Abul Bashar alias Badsha, Abdur Rab alias Rouf, Syed Hossain, Ayiub Hossain, Md. Aslam Bhuiyan, Akter Hossain alias SDU and Mukul alias Mokbul Hossain were examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure when they repeated their innocence and disclosed their unwillingness to adduce any defence witness. The rest 11 accused remained fugitive from justice on the date of examination under section 342 of the Code. The Tribunal considering the evidence and other materials on record found accused 1).Mohammad Ali, 2). Jewel alias Jahidul Haque, 3). Tipu, 4). Shaheen, 5). Abul Bashar alias Badsha, and 6). Akter Hossain alias Akter son of Alim Uddin guilty under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code and awarded the sentence of death upon them. The Tribunal also found guilty accused Syed Hossain, Abdur Rab alias Rouf, Ayiub Hossain, Aslam Bhuiyan, Akter Hossain alia SDU, Mukul alias Mokbul Hossain, Mobarak Hossain, Kamal, Jalil Miah, Jahirul Islam and Jahangir under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code and sentenced them to suffer imprisonment for life with a fine of Taka 50,000 each in default to suffer imprisonment for 1 year more. The Tribunal also made the reference under section 374 of the Code for confirmation of sentence of death awarded upon 6 (six) condemned prisoners as aforesaid.<br/><br/>Convict Jewel alias Jahidul Haque being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and order of conviction of sentence preferred Criminal Appeal no. 6669 of 2007 and Jail Appeal no. 936 of 2007, convict appellant Abul Bashar alias Badsha preferred Criminal Appeal no.  5422 of 2006 and Jail Appeal No. 1049 of 2006, convicts appellants Akter Hossain alias Akter son of Alim Uddin, Abdur Rab alias Rouf and Aslam Bhuiyan jointly preferred Criminal Appeal no. 5323 of 2006 and Jail Appeal no. 1048 of 2006, Akter Hosssain alias SDU son of Ramiz Uddin preferred Criminal Appeal 5137 of 2006, Syed Hossain, Ayiub Hossain and Mukul alias Mokbul Hossain jointly preferred Criminal Appeal no. 5316 of 2006. Shaheen preferred Jail Appeal no. 110 of 2007, convicts Kamal and Jahirul Islam preferred Criminal Miscellaneous Case no. 5789 of 2008 and convict Jalil Miah preferred Criminal Miscellaneous Case no. 4472 of 2007 under section 561A of the Code to scrap of the judgment and order of conviction and sentence. Since the death reference, the criminal appeals, the jail appeals and criminal miscellaneous cases arose out of the same judgment and the order of conviction and sentence all the proceedings have been heard together and are being disposed of by this common judgment.<br/><br/>Mr. M. A. Mannan Mohan, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing with Mr. Md. Osman Gani Khan, the learned Assistant Attorney General for the State having taken us through the judgment and order of conviction and sentence under the reference, the FIR, the evidence on record and the other materials on record makes his submission supporting the reference and opposing the appeals and criminal miscellaneous cases. He submits that a very shocking and gruesome murder of deceased Md. Shafiqul Islam was taken place on 08.11.2005 at 9.30 P.M. in front of Sunny confectionary (known also as Babul confectionary) at Vulta under Rupganj police station, Narayanganj when he was entering into his car by the convicts of this case and the occurrence of murder has been witnessed by the ocular witnesses namely PWs 2,3,8 and 9. The other witnesses namely PWs 10 and 12 also found some of the accused to leave the place of occurrence after causing murder of the deceased. He categorically submits that PWs 2,3,8 and 9 found accused Mohammad Ali to fire a pistol shot on the right ear of the deceased causing his instant death and the rest accused also had participated in the murder of Md. Shafiqul Islam with Mohammad Ali. They had raided the deceased as well as the car of the deceased so that the deceased cannot escape from the place of occurrence and thus they had actively participated in the murder of deceased Md. Shafiqul Islam jointly in furtherance of their common intention of all. He also submits that though the convicts and the deceased belonged to same political identity but there was a hitch between them. The convicts under the leadership of Mohammad Ali were engaged in the nefarious activities of the locality but the deceased tried to resist them but failed and the deceased also did not give blow to the illegal activities of the accused which made them furious. Before 3/4 days of occurrence, an illegal motor cycle used by accused Mohammad Ali was seized by the police. Accused Mohammad Ali and his followers held deceased Md. Shafiqul Islam responsible for the said seizing and took the decision to murder him and ultimately they had executed their plan murdering the deceased in the place of occurrence and after causing murder of the deceased they fled away successfully. But the eye witnesses found them in the light of the electricity available in the place of occurrence and the Tribunal being convinced of the univocal and cogent evidence of the eye witnesses and other materials on record found the accused guilty rightly under sections 302 and 34 of the Penal Code and awarded death sentence upon 6 (six) accused and imprisonment for life upon the rest 11 accused. The conviction and sentence of the accused are based on legal and nitid evidence of the witness. So, the judgment of order of conviction and sentence do not call for any interference from this Court and with these words he canvases for the acceptance of the reference, dismissal of the appeals and discharging of the Rules of the miscellaneous cases filed by the convicts.<br/><br/>On the other hand Mr. Md. Abdul Aziz Miah the learned Advocate appearing for the condemned prisoners Mohammad Ali and Tipu opposes the reference submitting that both the accused and the deceased belonged to same political identity. The accused did not murder the deceased as alleged by the prosecution case and though the prosecution examined 37 witnesses in this case and out of these 37 witnesses PWs 2,3,8 and 9 deposed as ocular witnesses but in fact they did not witness the occurrence. The evidence of PWs 2,3,8 and 9 are not also credible. PW 2 Md. Jahangir had no any business at Vulta at the relevant time. He is known as common witness of the locality whose presence has been introduced in this case in order to strengthen the prosecution story and as such he is a chance witness of this case. He also submits that though PWs 3 and 8 appears to be accompanying member of deceased and though it was claimed that at the relevant time they were at Sunny confectionary but for two reasons they did not witness the occurrence. It is in the evidence of PW 13, the proprietor of Sunny confectionary that when they had heard the sound of firing they lied on the floor, so there was no scope on the part of PWs 3 and 8 to witness the occurrence of firing and the other gesture and posture of the rest accused and secondly there was no sufficient light in the place of occurrence. So, in the absence of any acceptable means of recognition, the evidence of PWs 3 and 8 regarding the identification of the accused is not compatible with the facts and circumstances of the case. He also submits that PW 9 is a political friend of the deceased who had no occasion to witness the occurrence. He had deposed for his friend only. But the Tribunal without considering this aspect of the case wrongly found the condemned prisoners Mohammad Ali and Tipu guilty under section 302/34 of the Penal Code and awarded the death sentence. So, the death sentence of condemned prisoners Mohammad Ali Tipu is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>Mrs. Hasna Begum, the learned Advocate appearing for the condemned prisoners Abul Bashar alias Badsha, Akter Hossain alias Akter, Abdur Rab alias Rouf, Aslam Bhuiyan and Shaheen in Jail Appeals being nos. 1049 of 2006, 1048 of 2006 and 110 of 2007 opposes the death reference and supporting the jail appeals filed by those five condemned prisoners reiterated the argument advanced by the stated defence lawyer Mr. Abdul Aziz Miah. She also submits that though the Tribunal awarded death sentence upon those 3 accused and imprisonment for life upon rest of 2 accused but there was no legal and unblemished evidence on record to find them guilty. She categorically submits that though there was a long list of witnesses in the case but as per prosecution case PWs 2,3,8 and 9 are the only eye witnesses in this case. But their evidence is not believable and credible at all. PW 2 is a chance, partisan and a common witness of the criminal cases of that locality. She also submits that there was no sufficient light to identify the accused, so, PWs 3 and 8 were not in a position to witness the assailant and other accused. So the Tribunal very erroneously relied on the incredible evidence of PWs 2,3,8 and 9 and thereby came to a wrong conclusion finding the condemned prisoners and others guilty under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code. Thus she conjures to reject the reference and to allow the jail appeals filed by those 5 convicts.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Baharuddin-Al-Razi, the learned Advocate appearing for the condemned prisoner Jewel reiterating the arguments advanced by the learned Advocate Md. Abdul Aziz Miah and Mrs. Hasna Begum submits that the conviction and sentence of condemned prisoner Jewel is based mainly on the evidence of so-called eye witnesses of PW 2,3,8 and 9. But PW 2 is a chance witness in any view of the matter. PWs 3 and 4 though claimed to have been in the Sunny confectionary at the relevant time but in view of their own evidence they did not get any chance to witness the occurrence as well as the assailant and the other accused and PW 9 was also a partisan witness of the prosecution. Thus he conjures to acquit Jewel from the charge levelled against him.<br/><br/>Mr. Syed Mizanur Rahman, the learned Advocate appearing for the condemned prisoner Abul Bashar alias Badsha in Criminal Appeal no. 5422 of 2006 submits that deceased Md. Shafiqul Islam might have been murdered on the date of occurrence at Vulta but accused Abul Bashar alias Badsha is not involved with the occurrence of this case. He categorically submits that the prosecution had knitted the prosecution story leaving the facts of the case. PW 2 is a common witness of the locality and he is not a man of clean image and he was convicted in a criminal case and he has become an expert witness to face the lawyers in the Court. As such, he was examined in this case as an important witness. He also submits that the there was a police out post adjacent to the said place of occurrence at Vulta but none of the member of police was informed about the occurrence and the presence of police in the scene of the occurrence is almost nil though there appears the presence of many witnesses which is very unusual and unbelievable. He submits that PWs 3 and 8 cannot be trusted at all as they are the close relations of the deceased. The prosecution could not prove the means of recognition of this case by any cogent and reliable evidence thereby arrived at a wrong decision finding accused Abul Bashar alias Badsha guilty. He also submits that though there appears a recovery of mobile set by witness Kaiyum allegedly belonged to accused Abul Bashar alias Badsha but the fact of recovery did not find place in the FIR. So the recovery of mobile set is nothing but a myth which has been introduced to include the accused with the case. He further submits that though PW 9 claimed to have seen the occurrence as eye witness but at the time of occurrence he was near the baby taxi stand at Vulta which is far away from the place of occurrence. So he had no occasion to witness any accused of this case. But the trial Tribunal wrongly relied on the evidence of PW 9 also. He further submits that the fire arms allegedly used in the occurrence of this case was allegedly recovered at the instance of this accused and though the said arms was examined by the ballistic expert but there is nothing in the said report to connect the said fire arms with the occurrence of this case. Some pillets were also recovered from the place of occurrence and from the dead body of the deceased but there is no any such proof that the pillets correspond the fire arms. So, there was no scope to say that said recovered arms was used in the murder of the deceased. Thus the learned Advocate prays for rejection of the reference and to allow the criminal appeal filed by this condemned prisoner.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Fazlul Haque Khan Farid, the learned Advocate appearing for condemned prisoner Akter Hossain son of Alim Uddin, convicts Abdur Rob alias Rouf and Aslam Bhuiyan in Criminal Appeal no. 5323 of 2006 submits that the investigation of this case was started on the basis of a GD entry but during the investigation and trial, the FIR lodged by PW 1 was treated as FIR. He adds that when an investigation is started upon a GD entry that DG entry is the FIR and the subsequent FIR lodged by PW 1 is nothing but a statement under section 161 of the Code. But this principle of law has been seriously ignored. He also submits that the FIR was lodged after 22.15 hours of the occurrence with an intention to include the accused who were not in the scene at all. Prosecution could not examine a single independent and disinterested witness in this case. He categorically submits that PWs 2,3,8 and 9 claimed to have seen the occurrence from a close vision but none of them are independent and disinterested witness. So, it is natural and probable that they will give obliging evidence in the Court favouring the prosecution but these realities have not been appreciated by the trial Tribunal. If the evidence of PWs 2,3,8 and 9 are left out from consideration there appears no evidence against any of the accused of this case.  PW 13,  the Proprietor of Sunny alias Babul confectionary is a competent as well as independent and disinterested witness and at the time of occurrence he was present in his confectionary. He simply deposed that he heard the sound of firing but he did not witness the occurrence and if it is so, the PWs 3 and 8 who were in his shop also did not witness the occurrence but the total prosecution case is based on the evidence of PWs 3 and 8. The trial Tribunal relying on the evidence of PWs 3 and 8 found the accused guilty and awarded highest sentence to them. Thus he conjures to reject the reference and to allow the criminal appeal filed by these 3 appellants.<br/><br/>Mr. Sheikh Mohammad Rezaul Islam, the learned Advocate appearing for the convict appellants Ayiub Hossain, Syed Hossain and Mukul alias Mokbul Hossain in Criminal Appeal no. 5316 of 2006 and also for convict petitioner Kamal and Zahirul Islam in Criminal Miscellaneous Case no. 5789 of 2008 opposing the judgment submits that the informant lodged the FIR after almost 22 hours of the occurrence implicating the accused with the case but the prosecution could not prove the charge relying on the cogent and unblemished evidence of the prosecution witnesses. The prosecution as well as the trial Tribunal relied much upon the evidence of PWs 2,3,8 and 9 but none of them were present in the place of occurrence. The presence of PW 2 Md. Jahangir in the place of occurrence did not justify from his own evidence. He also submits that Mukul alias Mokbul is not FIR named accused, had he been in the place of occurrence, his name would have been in the FIR. The so called eyewitnesses PWs 2 and 3 did not tell the name of accused Mukul alias Mokbul. He further submits that there was no sufficient light to witness the occurrence and the prosecution could not prove the means of recognition in this case. PWs 11 and 26 were not named in the charge sheet as witnesses but the prosecution examined them, so their evidence is not admissible and believable in this case. Thus he prays for the acquittal of convict appellants Ayiub Hossain, Syed Hossain and Mukul alias Mokbul while he prays for quashing the judgment and the order of conviction and sentence as against accused Kamal and Zahirul Islam.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Zafor Sadeque, the learned Advocate appearing for the convict petitioner Jalil Miah in Criminal Miscellaneous Case no. 4472 of 2007 reiterating the arguments as advanced by the learned Advocates for others adds that the petitioner Jalil Miah could not face the trial and after pronouncement of the judgment he was arrested, as such, he could not prefer appeal within time, thus he preferred a criminal miscellaneous case under section 561A of the Code to quash the judgment against him. He submits that the trial Tribunal though convicted and sentenced him relying on the evidence of PW 2,3,8 and 9 but they are not independent and disinterested witnesses rather they are the partisan and relations of the deceased, as such, the trial Tribunal should have not relied on their evidence in convicting the petitioner.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Abdul Razzak, the learned Advocate appearing for the convict appellant Ayiub Hossain in Criminal Appeal no. 5316 of 2006 reiterating the arguments advanced by the other lawyers submits that the so called eyewitness PW 2 did not tell the name of accused Ayiub Hossain. PW 8 another eye witness testified that there was not light in the post where the car was parked, so the recognition of the accused is doubtful. PW 9 another eye witness though told the name of this accused before the Tribunal but at the time of statement under section 164 of the Code did not tell his name. He adds that presence of PWs 3 and 8 in the place of occurrence is doubtful. He prayed for acquittal of accused Ayiub Hossain from the charge levelled against him.<br/><br/>Now, in order to appreciate the arguments advanced by the prosecution and the learned Advocates for the convict appellants and the petitioners let the evidence adduced by the prosecution in this case be scrutinized and analyzed.<br/><br/>PW 1 Mofizuddin Bhuiyan alias Mofiz Member, the informant as well as the father of deceased is not an eyewitness of the occurrence.

He adds that the doctor recovered the parts of bullet from the body of the deceased which was given to him and he seized the same under a seizure list, D.B Officer Ehsan was not the supervising officer of this case, he cannot say whether seized bullets belonged to same pistol or not, witnesses Monir and Kamal are the cousins of the deceased. He denied the defence suggestion that Jahangir is a professional witness. He denied the defence suggestion that no motorcycle belonged to Mohammad Ali was seized ever rather the same plot has been created for the purpose of this case. He further stated that Vulta turning point is a populous area of the locality, he did not examine the constables of Vulta Police Outpost, the police of that outpost was not in the mobile duty at the time of occurrence, later on they were suspended, he arrested Alauddin, the President of Murapara Union Awamileague suspiciously, Alauddin is the father of accused Akter and father-in-law of accused Rouf.<br/><br/>He adds that he examined witness Jahangir on 09.11.2005 who did not state to him that immediately after occurrence he had informed the occurrence to the informant. PW 13 Md. Ashraful Islam Babul did not state to him that Shafiq had parked the car in front of his shop and also did not state that his accompanying members had taken snacks from his shop from time to time, he also did not state that the said two accompanying members of Shafiq had been roaming around the place of occurrence.

He denied the defence suggestion that he invented PW 26 as witness in this case to implicate Badsha with the occurrence of this case and also to serve the same purpose he invented PW 27 also, he did not ascertain the ownership of the yellow taxi cab. He denied the further defence suggestion that he in order to strengthen the prosecution case introduced the story of yellow taxi cab and mobile set. He denied the defence suggestion that the deceased was murdered by some unknown assailants but with an ill motive he has implicated the accused falsely in this case. He further stated that the FIR was lodged after 21.30 hours. He denied the defence suggestion that he did not investigate the case properly and has submitted a perfunctory charge sheet against the accused in this case.<br/><br/>These are the evidences that have been given by the prosecution in this case. From the evidence discussed above it appears that the prosecution examined 37 witnesses in all out of which PW 22 is a doctor, PWs 23 and 34 are Magistrates, PWs 33,34,35 and 37 are the police personnel and the rest 30 are the local witnesses.<br/><br/>The death of deceased Md. Shafiqul Islam on 08.11.2005 at around 9.30 PM at Vulta under Rupganj Police Station is not at all disputed in this case. The common defence case of the condemned prisoners as well as the convict appellants is that deceased Shafiqul Islam might have been murdered by some unknown assailants on 08.11.2005 at Vulta. After the death of Shafiqul Islam post mortem examination on his cadaver was held by PW 22 Dr. Md. Shahjahan Miah who found one bullet injury on the right ear where laceration was found and he also found another swelling on the left tempro occipital area where a bullet was found. In the opinion of the doctor death of the deceased was caused due to shock and hemorrhage resulting from the gun shot injury which was antemortem and homicidal in nature. PW 22 was crossed examined extensively by the defence but his such evidence has not been squeezed or discredited in any way. In cross-examination the only point raised that an injury caused by bullet must be a punctured injury but PW 22 in his reply stated that it is not a common feature that bullet injury always must be a punctured injury rather it may be a lacerated injury even. Thus we find nothing wrong in the medical evidence for which we can discard this evidence. Moreso as we have noticed it earlier that the death of the deceased for the gun shot injury which he had received on the date of occurrence is not disputed at all. Thus from the medical evidence on record we find that deceased Shafiqul Islam was done to death for the gun shot injury which he had received at the time of occurrence.<br/><br/>From the hearing of this reference, appeals and petitions if we encapsulate the arguments and submissions of the learned Advocates appearing for the condemned prisoners as well as for the appellants and the petitioners we find that they by their common submissions seek to impeach the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence mainly on seventh fold arguments.<br/><br/>Firstly, the investigation of this case was started immediately after the death of the deceased by PW 37 on the basis of a G.D entry. So, the subsequent FIR should have been considered as statement of the witness and the G.D entry which was recorded on 08.11.2005 should have been considered as FIR, but the trial Tribunal failed to appreciate this fact and legal position of the case.<br/><br/>Secondly, the trial Tribunal relying on the evidence of so-called eye witnesses of PWs 2,3 and 8 found the accused guilty but PW 2 is a professional as well as chance witness who had no occasion to be present in the place of occurrence at the relevant time and PWs 3 and 8 are the close relations of the deceased as well as the informant. So, it is very usual and probable that they would depose favouring the prosecution under any circumstances. So, the trial Tribunal should have not relied on the evidence of PWs 2, 3 and 8. PWs 9, 10 and 12 though allegedly inferred the occurrence of shooting and though they allegedly found some of the accused to run away from the place of occurrence and though the Tribunal had relied on their such evidences but the Tribunal failed to appreciate that PWs 9, 10 and 12 are seriously involved with the politics of BNP and the deceased and as his father, the informant Mofizuddin member are also activist of BNP. So, it is very natural and probable that PWs 9, 10 and 12 will favour the prosecution.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the recovery of mobile set from the place of occurrence and the subsequent evidence in respect of said mobile set that the set belonged to Badsha are not believable at all. The FIR was lodged after 22 hours of the occurrence but the story of the said recovery did not find place in the FIR. So, the Tribunal should have disbelieved the story of recovery of the mobile set.<br/><br/>Fourthly, deceased Shafiqul Islam and his father were the leaders and activists of BNP while the accused belonged to Awamileague as such the informant had implicated the accused with the occurrence of this case to address their political rivalry.<br/><br/>Fifthly, the  alleged meeting and sitting by some of the accused in the shop of PW 11 to hatch the plan of murder of Shafique and the witnessing of some of the accused by PW 7 at Vulta immediate before the occurrence is nothing but a myth and the same has been introduced in order to strengthen the prosecution case.<br/><br/>Sixthly, there was no light in the place of occurrence, so the recognition of the accused by the witness in the night of occurrence is not believable and in the absence of means of recognition conviction and sentence is not maintainable.<br/><br/>Seventhly and lastly, if it is conceded for a moment that condemned prisoner Mohammad Ali fired the gun sot on the ear of deceased Shafiq causing his death in that case also for the mere presence of other accused in the place of occurrence was not sufficient to find them guilty under sections 302/34 of the Penal code as they did not participate in the occurrence of murder of the deceased and they had no any intention to kill the deceased. So, the conviction and sentence of co-accused other than Mohammad Ali is bad and illegal in the eye of law.<br/><br/>Now, let us scan and explore the evidence on record and the legal aspect thereto to find out the justification of the above arguments.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate for the appellants referring the decision of the case of Muslemuddin and others-Vs-The state, 38 DLR(AD) 311 argued that from the evidence of PW 37 it transpires that the investigation was started on the basis is of G.D no. 370 dated 08.11.2005. So, the said G.D should have been treated as FIR and subsequent to that G.D, any information to the police station should have been considered as statement under section 161 of the Code. It is fact that in the reported case it was held that any information at the earliest opportunity to the Police Station in respect of commission of cognizable offence is the FIR within the meaning of section 154 of the Code and all other subsequent information will come within the provision of section 161 of the Code. With all regards to the reported case we find that in the reported case, the information was given to the Police Station in respect of commission of murder of that particular case by somebody else, but the case in our hands goes to show that the G.D was recorded on the basis of a radio message and no body else informed the police station about the commission of murder of Shafiqul Islam. So, it is difficult to find similarity between the reported case and the case in our hands in respect of recording of the G.D entry. Moreso, an FIR is recorded in accordance with the provision of section 154 of the Code, as such naturally before treating an information as FIR, it is to be seen whether it fulfills the requirements of section 154 of the Code. In view of language used in this section, any vague or indefinite or incomplete information, even if it relates to a cognizable offence, cannot be an information to be treated as an FIR. In the case of Bachchu Sarder and others-Vs-The State reported in 11 BLT (AD) 53 the same argument was placed before the Appellate Division. From the case of 11 BLT we find that PW 2 who was a widow of one of the victim deposed that during the incident when the accused persons were assaulting her husband she had rushed to the Police Station and informed the Inspector and thereupon a G.D entry was recorded. PW 1 who was the mother of the victim deposed that soon after the incident she had rushed to the local Police Station and on the way she found the police officer coming towards the place of occurrence and on that spot, the Officer-in-Charge recorded the FIR on her statement. The Sessions Judge as well as the High Court Division noticed the aforesaid circumstances in which the G.D was made and the FIR was recorded. Leave was sought on the ground that the trial Court acted illegally in not considering the G.D as FIR. But the Appellate Division turned down the plea of the petitioner. Thus we find from the decision of 11 BLT (AD) 53 that any information or a G.D entry which is the first in point of time may not necessarily be treated as FIR.<br/><br/>In the reported case of Moni Mohan Ghose-Vs- The King Emperor 35 CWN 623 the Court considered the third information as FIR in view of the facts and circumstances of that case, in that case, the first FIR was found to be vague and the police found the second information as not true and the third information for the first time indicated the commission of cognizable offence, as such the third information was treated as FIR. So, vague and indefinite information even if it relates to a cognizable offence cannot be treated as FIR. In the instant case the G.D was recorded mainly hearing the news of death of Shafiqul Islam over a radio message. The information was not complete and full in respect of the commission of the murder of the deceased. So, such a superficial G.D entry can not be treated as FIR.<br/><br/>Moreso, if an information which is first in point of time is always considered as FIR, the consequence may frustrate the purpose of real justice. Sometimes it happens that those who actually commit the offence, to save themselves lodge misleading information narrating a concocted story. In this connection the case reported in 6 MLR (AD) 170 may be cited here. In this case it was found that the accused persons mislead the father of the victim stating that his daughter committed suicide by taking poison and accordingly the father lodged the FIR stating that his daughter died by taking poison. On the basis of this FIR when the Investigating Officer started investigation, found marks of injury on the dead body and sent the dead body for autopsy and after receiving the postmortem report second FIR was lodged by the police. In these circumstances, it was held that the second FIR was not barred and the second FIR was neither treated as a statement under section 161 of the Code nor it was considered inadmissible under section 162 of the Code.<br/><br/>In this connection, the case of State-Vs- Zillul Bari and others reported in 57 DLR(AD) 129 may also be cited here. In this case, one Chapa was found dead in her bed room. The accused who are inmates and close relations of Chapa lodged FIR stating that Chapa was murdered by some unknown miscreants by an iron rod from outside the window in order to take away her ornaments. Police started investigation and found that  the FIR story was not true and found evidence that some inmates of those of the house had murdered Chapa. The police lodged another FIR and on the basis of this FIR, charge sheet was submitted and trial was held.<br/> <br/>So, we find that it cannot be a universal dogma that the information in respect of commission of a cognizable offence first in point of time to the Police Station is always must be an FIR and if it is taken as a matter of fact it will be risky and suicidal for the administration of criminal justice. Thus we find that the FIR lodged by PW 1, the father of deceased knowing the fact from the witnesses who were present in the scene of the occurrence was rightly treated as FIR by the Court below.<br/><br/>The learned counsel for the appellants argued in respect of credibility of the evidence of PWs 2,3 and 8 that PW 2 Jahangir is a professional, common as well as chance witness while PWs 3 and 8 are the close relations of the victim as well as the informant. So, the Tribunal should have not relied on their evidence. It is fact that PWs 2, 3 and 8 are the star witnesses of this case as the occurrence of murder of deceased Shafiqul Islam was witnessed by these 3 witnesses from a close vision. It was canvassed seriously before us  that PW 2 was accused in many criminal cases and as such he has become a very sharp and cunning witness and to take the advantage of his such skill knowledge of legal arena, the prosecution has introduced his presence in the scene of the occurrence with a plan to examine him as an eye witness. It is also submitted before us that he is a common witness of the cases of that locality. But we find that the defence could not bring a scrap of paper to show that he had deposed in any case as canvassed by them. So, their such submission that PW 2 is a common and chance witness of the case of that locality has no merit to stand. It is fact that PW 2 was the accused of a criminal case and he was also convicted in that case but subsequently he has been acquitted from that case. But that cannot be a ground to discard the evidence of a witness if otherwise his evidence is found to be true and genuine.<br/><br/>Admittedly, PWs 3 and 8 are the cousins of the deceased Shafiqul Islam. It is in the FIR that Shafiqul Islam had gone at Vulta along with these 2 witnesses and when he had attended in the meeting at Awal market PWs 3 and 8 were roaming in front of Sunny confectionary centering the said confectionary. The FIR was lodged after almost 22 hours of the occurrence. The defence also assails the lodging of the FIR with such a delay alleging that the FIR was lodged after 22 hours intentionally so that a concocted and got up story can be built up through the FIR. The FIR itself has an explanation as to the delay in lodging the same. In the FIR it has been adverted that since some time has been killed to complete the burial function of the deceased, the delay took place in lodging the FIR. It is in the evidence of PW 1 that the burial function of his son was completed after the Asar prayer and the FIR was lodged at 7.45 PM on the following day on 09.11.2005. The learned counsel for the defence referred the case of Shamsul Haque-Vs-The State reported in 6 BCR 65 wherein it was observed that the FIR was lodged after 10 hours which could have been lodged within the 3-4 hours at the best. But PW 1 in his cross-examination stated in the following manner:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"ঘটনার কথা শুনিয়া অজ্ঞান হইয়া যাইz অজ্ঞান হওয়ার কথা আমি এজাহা­র লিখি নাই. আমি কাদ­ত কাদ­ত অজ্ঞান হইয়া পড়ি"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>By the occurrence of this case PW 1 had lost his only son who happened to be an educated and at the same time a business man and he was involved with the local politics of BNP. From the whole record we find no aspersion or bad remarks on the character of the deceased. So, when any father losses his only beloved son like the deceased, it is very much natural and probable that he will be shocked and perplexed as it could be. So, it cannot be the top most priority of filing an FIR than that of the burial function of the deceased by a father. Moreso, immediate after occurrence PW 1 became also sick for the shock which he received due to the murder of his only son. So, in this particular case though the FIR was lodged after almost 22 hours but that cannot be considered as an inordinate delay in the above facts and circumstances of the case and it cannot be considered that delay was taken intentionally in order to concoct the prosecution case. In such a natural, probable and unblemished FIR, the presence and the role of PWs 2,3 and 8 has been manifested clearly and their presence in the scene of the occurrence have been supported by the other witnesses. PWs 9, 10 and 12 though were involved with the politics of BNP but were not any nearest relations or close to the deceased, they testified that immediately after occurrence they found witness Janangir, Kamal and Monir in the place of occurrence who were trying to shift the victim to the hospital. PW 13, the proprietor of Babul alias Sunny Confectionary had confirmed the presence of PWs 3 and 8 at the time of occurrence. The defence did not hesitate to characterize PW 13 as a disinterested and independent witness. So, his evidence in respect of presence of PWs 3 and 8 in the place of occurrence is very much significant in this case.<br/><br/>PWs 9, 10 and 12 appears to be most natural and probable witnesses in this case. They were in the meeting of chatradal with the deceased and after closing of the meeting while they were waiting in the baby stand, a nearby spot of the place of occurrence for going to their own destination heard the sound of firing and coming to the place of occurrence found blood stained Shafiqul and witnesses Monir, Kama and Jahangir. PWs 9, 10 and 12 were cross examined extensively by the defence but their evidences has not been squeezed and discredited in any way. We find no minimum reason for which we can discard the evidence of these 3 witnesses in respect of witnessing Jahangir, Monir and Kamal in the place of occurrence immediately after occurrence.<br/><br/>Moreso, PW 32 Alhaj Md. Hasan Ali testified that he being informed of the occurrence at 10.15 PM of the night of occurrence over telephonic call by Ripon having been at Vulta general hospital found witness Jahangir from whom he heard the whole occurrence. PW 32 appears to be an aged man of 60 years who is a retired Vice President of Dhaka Bank though involved with the politics of BNP but at the same time he is not relation of the deceased. In this case it is to be noticed here that the materials on record show that the deceased was involved with the politics of BNP, but at the same time accused Mohammad Ali and his other most of the accomplice were also involved with the BNP politics. So, it is not expected that PWs 9,10,12 and 32 for the cause of politics only will depose favouring the prosecution. Since the deceased and most of the accused were involved with the same politics, so there should not be any aspersion and blame on their evidence that for the cause of politics they had deposed falsely favouring the prosecution. So, from the evidence on record we find that the presence of witnesses PW 2 Jahangir, PW 3 Monir and PW 8 Kamal in the place of occurrence at the time of occurrence has been proved by the cogent, reliable and credible evidence of other witnesses.<br/><br/>It is fact that the evidence of relative and partisan witnesses are to be scrutinized and considered carefully. But the witnesses are related with the deceased or the informant that should not be the only criteria to reject their evidence out rightly. In the case of 1981 BLD (AD) 200 it was held by the Appellate Division that relationship of the witness with the informant or the victim by itself cannot be a ground for rejecting his testimony unless it is shown that the witness was biased and restored to false hood. So, it can safely be said that the relationship of the witnesses with the deceased or informant should not to be the only criteria for rejection of their evidences unless there appears any biasness and falsity in their testimony rather we are to consider whether they gave any false and emotional evidence in the Court.<br/><br/>In the case of Majibur Rahman Vs. State 39 DLR 437, it was held that a close relative, who is a very natural witness cannot be branded as interested witness. The word "interested" postulates that witness must have some direct interest in having the accused somehow or otherwise convicted for some animus or for other reasons. Interested witness is not necessarily false witness though in fact that witness has personal interest in the matter. Evidence of such witness should be scrutinized on its merit, before investigating whether he is an interested one and such scrutiny of evidence is required as rule of prudence and not as rule of law (para 6 of the judgment).<br/><br/><strong>In the case of </strong>Abu Taher Chowdhury Vs. State 42 DLR (AD) 253, the Appellate Division held in the following ways:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“It is settled law that a conviction may be based only on the sole testimony of a single witness, if believed, and mere interestedness is no ground to reject the testimony of a witness, if otherwise the testimony is free from doubt".  </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The gist of the decision of the above referred case is that if the testimony of an interested witness is free from doubt that can be considered as sufficient to find the accused guilty.<br/><br/>In the case of Samad Sikder Vs. State 50 DLR (AD) 24, the Appellate Division observed in the following ways:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The learned Judges ought not to have rejected the evidence of these two witnesses merely on the ground that they were not disinterested witnesses when their examination-in-chief could not be shaken in cross-examination by the defence”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of Yogeshwar Gope Vs. State 58 DLR (AD) 73, it was held by the Appellate Division that only because of relationship their evidence cannot be thrown away unless the evidence is found to be  untrue or tainted with motive.<br/><br/>In the case of Abdul Hye Sikder Vs. State, 43 DLR (AD) 95=12 BLD (AD) 180, it is held in the following ways:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"The conviction of the appellants can safely be based on the solitary evidence of the eye witness, PW1.............His evidence is full, complete and self contained. It may not have received corroboration from other witnesses, but it stands fully corroborated by the circumstances of the case and the medical evidence on record. If this evidence is believed, and it has been rightly believed by both the Trial Court and the High Court Division, its fullness and completeness are enough to justify the conviction" (para 13 and 15 of the judgment).  </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of Abdul Quddus Vs. State, 43 DLR 234 the Appellate Division held in the following ways:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"We have indicated earlier that she (PW2) is the most natural, probable and competent witness in the present case as she was reading in the same room with her deceased sister Dilara and saw the entire occurrence. She has given details of the entire occurrence and even in her cross-examination the defence could not show any material discrepancy for which her ocular testimony should be disbelieved. She having deposed the entire incident from the beginning to the end it is very difficult for us to discard her evidence only on the ground that she was an interested witness and was a minor girl aged about 16 years. Even the law provides that a child witness can be relied if he/she is capable of understanding and replying the questions intelligently" (para 14 of the judgment).     </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The preponderant views emerged from the above reported cases are that mere relationship of the witnesses with the deceased or informant cannot be the only ground to discard the  evidence of such witnesses if they are not found biased in deposing the Court. In this particular case as we have noticed it earlier that the ocular witness PW 2 is not a relation of the deceased though he is a man of informant’s camp for the same politics of BNP and though PWs 3 and 8 are the cousins of the deceased, but in the facts and circumstances of the case it led us to hold that they are the most natural, probable and competent witnesses of the occurrence as the situation, the time of occurrence and the place of occurrence provides their presence in the place of occurrence and there appears no biasness, emotion and falsity in their evidence.<br/><br/>So, we find that mere relationship of the witnesses with the deceased either for the cause of politics or blood relationship is not the only ground to discard their evidence, if their evidence appears to be true and corroborated by the other witnesses in the record and that can be considered as sufficient and cogent to find the accused guilty.<br/><br/>PWs 2, 3 and 8 from a close vision found accused Mohammad Ali to cause gun shot on the right ear of deceased and also found his other accomplice to raid the deceased and his car so that the deceased cannot be escaped in any way from the hands of Mohammad Ali. The evidence of these 3 eyewitnesses cannot be disbelieved and discarded on any ground.<br/><br/>The learned counsel for the appellants submit that the recovery of a mobile set by PW 10 Abdul Quiyum from the place of occurrence immediately after occurrence has been introduced by the prosecution to include accused Badsha with the occurrence of this case, but there appears no cogent and reliable evidence on record to show that the mobile set belonged to accused Badsha. PW 10 testified that when he was going to Vulta general hospital from the place of occurrence he found a mobile set on earth. The mobile set has been seized by PW 37 under a seizure list, exhibit-20 having its SIM no. 0188017309. PW 26 Mrs. Akhi Noor was examined in this case to prove that the SIM no. 0188017309 belonged to Badsaha. PW 26 testified that she had gone to the house of her sister at Baniadi village where she had a occasion of intraction with one Jahir and accused Badsaha and at one stage they had exchanged their mobile numbers but in our consideration the exchange of mobile numbers between Aki Noor, a young women of 22 years with Badsha is improbable and unbelievable in the social context of our country and save and except this evidence of PW 26 we find no other materials on record to connect the said mobile set and number with accused Badsha.<br/><br/>The learned counsel for the appellants also argued that deceased Shafiqul Islam and his father PW 1 were seriously involved  with  the  politics of BNP while the accused belonged to Awamileague, so due to political rivalry the accused were implicated in this case without any basis. But the materials on record did not support the contention of the learned counsel of the appellants. PW 1 testified that he is an activist of BNP and at present he is the president of Murapara union BNP, he also stated that accused Akter Hossain is the son of an Awamileague worker and accused Badsha Mia was a BNP worker but for his nefarious activities he has been expelled from the party, accused Ayiub Hossain is a member of Jatiotabadi Jubodal, accused Syed Hossaina and his father are involved with the politics of BNP, PW 21 himself is the Secretary of Murapara Union Jubodal testified that accused Mohammad Ali was the President of Murapara Union Jubodal and after the murder of Shafiqul Islam he was expelled from his such position. So, we find that save and except accused Akter, son of Alimuddin most of the accused including accused Mohammad Ali under whose leadership the occurrence of murder took place were involved with the politics of BNP. However, from the above discussion also from the materials on record we find that there is nothing in the record to show that for the political rivalry the accused were implicated in this case.       <br/>The learned counsel for the appellants argued that the episode of the meeting by the accused in the shop of PW 11 and also witnessing of the accused prior to the occurrence at Vulta by PW  7  and also witnessing to cross  the  Kanchon  ferry by PW 4 immediately after occurrence is highly improbable and a cock and bull story which have been invented in order to strengthen the prosecution case. PW 11 Md. Jahirul Islam testified that on 05.11.2005 at 12.30 PM accused Badsha, Jewel, Tipu, Kamal, Akter, Shahin, Mokter and Jahirul had been discussing that for the resistance of Shafiq they could not do anything as such at any cost Shafiq should be finished but he did not disclose this fact to anybody else for fear of the accused. The evidence of PW 11 appears to be very  much appetizing that some of the accused had been at a meeting in his shop in his presence where they had taken a decision to murder the deceased. But this type of meeting and sitting regarding the commission of a heinous crime in presence of a witness who did not belong to them is highly improbable and unbelievable.<br/><br/>PW 7 Md. Shakawat Hossain Kamal testified that on 08.11.2005 at 8.00 PM of the night when he came at Vulta bus stand found accused Syed Kamal, Jahirul Islam, Ayuib, Rouf, SDU and Mokbul to gossip among themselves and in the same night at 9.45 PM he came to know about the murder of the deceased and he having been at Vulta general hospital found the dead body of Shafiq. He also categorically stated that he stated this occurrence to PW 1. From the materials on record we find that this particular prosecution story that PW 7 found the accused near the place of occurrence immediately before the occurrence did not find place in the FIR. So, we are unable to accept the evidence of PW 7 that he had witnessed some of the accused immediately before occurrence as the FIR was lodged after a reasonable time of the occurrence and PW 1 being a sensible man who is involved with the politics as well as a successful businessman must not leave such an important fact at the time of lodging FIR.<br/><br/>PW 4 Md. Mofizul Islam testified that on 08.11.2005 at 10.00 PM he found accused Mohammad Ali, Badsha, Shahin, Jewel, Tipu to get down from a yellow taxi cab to cross the Kanchon ferry ghat. By this evidence of PW 4 the prosecution tried to draw a conclusion that after committing the murder of the deceased those 6 accused had left the place of occurrence by a yellow taxi cab and they had crossed the Kanchan ferry ghat. There appears no corroboration to the testimony of PW 4 that he had witnessed those accused to cross the Kanchan ferry ghat. So, we are unable to rely on the evidence of PW 4 that he had witnessed some of the accused at Kanchan ferry gnat.<br/><br/>As to the means of recognition the learned counsels for the appellants contend that the prosecution could not prove the means of recognition in this case. They categorically submits that the occurrence took place at 9.30 PM and the car of deceased was parked under a pillar where admittedly there was no light of electricity, so it was not possible on the part of the eye witnesses to witness the accused. In the case of State-Vs-Monjur 15 BLD 193 it was held that means of recognition is important in criminal case when the incident took place in the night. PW 2, an eye witness of the occurrence stated in his evidence in the following ways:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“ঘটনাসহ­ল বিদ্যুৎ ছিল পর্যাপ্ত, আমরা আসামী­দর­ক চিন­ত পে­রছি”<br/>PW 3 another eye witness stated in following ways:<br/>“সানি কন­ফকশনারী থে­ক ঘটনাসহল গাড়ীর দূরত্ব ছিল ৬/৭ গজ. ঘটনাসহ­ল ­বৈদ্যুতিক আ­লা ছিল. তিনটি  সাইন বোর্ড ছিল. বৈদ্যুতিক আ­লা­ত আসামী­দর চিন­ত পে­রছি”<br/>PW 8 another eye witnesses stated that –<br/>বৈদ্যুতিক আ­লা­ত আসামী­দর চিন­ত পারি, তৎম­র্ম সমস¹ ঘটনা বাদী নিহত শফি­কর পিতা­ক জানাই.<br/>In cross-examination he stated in the following ways:<br/>“ঘটনার সময় রাস্তায় লাইট ছিল কিনা জানা ­নই. ত­ব একটি খাম্পার লাইট ছিল. সত্য নয় যে, ঘটনার সময় ভুলতা মো­ড় কোন বাতি ছিল না”<br/>PW 13 Md. Ashraful Islam Babul, the proprietor of Sunny confectionary stated in the following ways:<br/>“গাড়িটি একটি পিলা­রর পা­শ রাখে. বৈদ্যুতিক পিলার সেটি. এই পিলারটি­ত লাইট ছিল না. অন্য পিলা­র লাইট ছিল. দোকা­নর সাইন বো­র্ডর আ­লা ছিল উক্ত সহা­ন.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The above noted 4 witnesses were also cross-examined by the defence extensively as to the means of recognition. But their evidences has not been shaken away in any way rather the evidence of PWs 2,3,8 and 13 as to the means of recognitioin is very much consistent and corroborative with each other. So, considering the consistent and credible evidence of P.Ws. 2,3,8 and 13 that they had seen the accused in the light of electricity available in the place of occurrence cannot be thrown away.<br/><br/>The Tribunal mainly relying on the evidence of PWs 2, 3 and 8 found the condemned prisoners and other appellants guilty under section 302/34 of the Penal Code. It was argued by the learned counsel of the appellants that if it is conceded for a moment that deceased Shafiqul Islam met his death for the gun shot injury caused by Mohammad Ali in that case also the other accused who were allegedly found present in the place of occurrence having no active participation in the act of the murder of the deceased should have not been found guilty under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>Now, from the arguments of the learned counsels for the appellants it appears that the main question which is involved on this point is whether condemned prisoners other than Mohammad Ali and the other appellants had shared their common intention of causing murder of the deceased Shafiq with accused Mohammad Ali. In this regard the learned Deputy Attorney General referred the case of The State-Vs-Abul Khair 44 DLR 284 where it has been held that common intention of several persons is to be inferred from their conduct, manner and doing of the act and the attending circumstances of the case.<br/><br/>From the consistent and unequivocal evidence of PWs 2,3 and 8 we find that accused Mohammad Ali, Jewel alias Jahirul Haque, Tipu, Akter Hossain son of Alimuddin and Badsha Mia and Shahin forming a group had come in the place of occurrence from the eastern side of Vulta and they encircled the deceased while accused A. Rob alias Rouf, Mobarak Hossain, Kamal, Syed Hossai, Ayuib Hossain and Aslam Bhuiya, Md. Jalil Miah and Jahirul Islam forming another group had come in the place of occurrence from the western part of Vulta who had encircled the private car of deceased Shafiqul Islam and when Shafiq was trying to enter into the car Mohammad Ali fired the gun shot on the right ear of the deceased. It is not the prosecution case that those accomplice of Mohammad Ali were present in the place of occurrence accidentally or for any other reason they had gone there forming two groups at the same time. The very arrival of those accused in the place of occurrence at the same time when Shafiq had arrived beside his car is the gorgeous prove that all the accused had a common intention of causing murder of the deceased. Those accused had no any other business in the place of occurrence other than the sharing of the intention of murder of the deceased with accused Mohammad Ali. So, their such presence with accused Mohammad Ali in the spot has established that they had the common intention to cause the murder of Shafiqul Islam. The presence of other accused with Mohammad Ali in the spot encircling the deceased and his private car in that particular time is nothing but sharing the common intention with accused Mohammad Ali in causing the murder of deceased. They had no any job at the relevant time without ensuring the murder of the deceased. The deceased and his car were encircled by the other accused in such a manner so that the deceased cannot be escaped from the men circle in any way planted by the accused. The very guarding of the deceased by the other accused is the conclusive prove that they had a common intention to cause the murder of deceased.<br/><br/>In the case of Nazimuddin and others-Vs-State 36 DLR 22 it has been held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"It is the essence of section 34 PC that the accused persons must be physically present at the place and at the time of commission of crime and the incriminating acts and circumstances must be necessary to lead the inference of common intention to commit the crime."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of Rasool Box-Vs-State 22 DLR(SC) 297 it has been held by H Rahman J as his Lordship then was, that:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"There is no doubt that to bring a case within the ambit of section 34 of the Penal Code it is necessary that some overt act or acts must be established to lead to the inference that the participators in a crime acted in pre-concert or under a pre-arranged plan but this does not mean that every participant in the crime must be shown, to have committed the same kind of act. It is sufficient to show that they joined together in the commission of a particular act, for then they must all be deemed to have intended the natural and inevitable consequence of that act even if some of them did nothing but merely helped by their presence the commission of the act."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Thus it is not necessary to show that any overt act must have been done by a particular accused but section 34 of the Penal Code is attracted if it is established that the criminal act has been done by all or any one of the accused persons in furtherance of a common intention. Common intention does not mean similar intention of several persons. Common intention may as well be inferred from the evidence or facts and circumstances of the case.<br/><br/>Thus the preponderant views emerged from the above noted decision is that the reason for making more than one accused guilty under the provisions of section 34 of the Penal Code as the very presence of co-accused gives encouragement, support and protection to the person actually committing an act. It may so happen that without the support of the co-accused who did nothing other than standing on the scene with the master mind offender, he would not be able to hit the victim without the support of the co-accused. In this particular case it was not possible on the part of accused Mohammad Ali alone to cause a pistol shot on the ear of deceased Shafiq without the support, encouragement and protection of his other accomplice co-accused that is why all the accused persons who remaining present in the scene of occurrence had given support, encouragement and protection to the principal accused in committing the crime of murder of Shafiq is held liable under section 34 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>PWs. 2,3 and 8 are the eye witnesses of the occurrence who very consistently stated that at the time of occurrence Mohammad Ali, Jewel alias Jahirul Haque, Tipu, Akter Hossain son of Alim Uddin, Md. Badsha Mia and Shahin coming from the eastern side of Vulta had encircled the deceased and Mohammad Ali fired pistol shot on the deceased causing him to death, they also stated that they found those accused to leave the place of occurrence immediately after occurrence. The evidence of these three ocular witnesses has not been shaken away in any way. The unequivocal and unblemished evidence of PWs 2,3, and8 has proved beyond all reasonable doubt that those 6 accused coming from the eastern side of Vulta had participated in the murder of deceased. In the same way PWs 2,3 and 8 stated that accused A. Rab alias Rouf, Kamal Miah, Syed Hossain, Jalil Miah and Jahirul Islam coming from the western side of Vulta into the place of occurrence had encircled the car of the deceased and participated in the commission of murder of the deceased. PWs 3 and 8 sated that accused Mobarak Hossain, Ayiub Hossain and Md. Aslam Bhuiyan coming from the western side had participated in the commission of murder of deceased. PW 2 though in his evidence did not state the names of above 3 accused namely Mobarak Hossain, Ayiub Hossain and Md. Aslam Bhuiyan but it is very much probable and natural that all the witnesses of a case may not see all the accused of an occurrence. Their such evidence had not been shaken away in any way though defence left no stone untouched to discredit them and their evidence. So, the trial Tribunal relying on their nitid, cogent and unshaken evidence rightly found convict Ayiub Hossain and Md. Aslam Bhuiyan guilty under sections 302/34 of the Code. Mobarak Hossain is not appellant before us, so we are refrained from making any comment as to the fugitive accused Mobarak Hossain. Though PW 2 did not tell the names of accused Ayiub Hossain and Aslam Bhuiyan but the rest 2 eye witnesses confirmed their presence with the other accused in the commission of murder of the deceased. So, the trial Tribunal rightly found them guilty relying on the evidence of PWs 3 and 8.<br/><br/>So far the convict appellants Akter Hossain alias SDU and Mukul alias Mokbul Hossain is concerned it appears that PW 8 the only eye witness who had found these two accused in the company of the other accused at the time of committing murder. The FIR was lodged by PW 1 hearing the occurrence from PWs 2, 3 and 8. It is in the evidence that all the accused and the eye witnesses belonged to the same area and they were known to each other before the occurrence of this case. Had the accused Akter Hossain alias SDU and Mukul alias Mokbul Hossain been witnessed by PW 8 at the time of occurrence that would have been revealed in the FIR. But we find that they are not FIR named accused. As such, there creates a doubt as to their presence in the place of occurrence and accordingly accused Akter Hossain alias SDU and Mukul alias Mokbul Hossain are entitled to get the benefit of doubt.<br/><br/>Accused Jalil Mia, Kamal alias Md. Kamal Hossain and Jahirul Islam alias Md. Jahirul Islam sought to quash the judgment and order of conviction and sentence invoking section 561A of the Code. But as we have found that from the evidence of PWs 2,3 and 8 the charge under sections 302/34 has been proved against them. In the case of Abdul Kader Chowdhury-Vs-The State, 28 DLR(AD) 38 it was held that where there is either no legal evidence adduced in support of the case or the evidence adduced clearly or manifestly fails to prove the charge, quashing of the  proceeding would be justified. The evidence of PWs 2,3 and 8 appears to be very much legal against the petitioners and by their cogent evidence charge has been proved against the petitioners. So, we find nothing illegal in the judgment and order of conviction and sentence in respect of these 3 petitioners also. So, Rule issued against the petitioners under section 561A of the Code are liable to be discharged.<br/><br/>Having regards to the above discussions and the materials on record we find that the prosecution was successful in proving the charge under sections 302/34 of the penal Code as against convicts Mohammad Ali, Jewel alias Jahirul Haque, Tipu, Akter Hossain son of Alim Uddin, Abul Bashar alias Badsha, Shahin, and convict appellants Abdur Rab alias Rouf, Kamal Miah, Syed Hossain, Ayuib Hossain, Md. Aslam Bhuiyan, Jalil Miah and Jahirul Islam.<br/><br/>As condemned prisoners Jewel alias Jahirul Haque, Akter Hossain son of Alimuddin, Abul Bashar alias Badsha and Shahin have been languishing in the condemned cell for a quite long time with a mental agony of death by hanging along with their tender age appears to us as extenuating circumstances to commute their sentence from death to imprisonment for life.
