They also found accused Nurul Kabir running away towards north. Later on P.Ws. 6 and 9 happened at the scene they also found the accused Nurul Kabir running away and heard that the accused Nurul Kabir inflicted gun-fire upon deceased Syed Karim. So the evidence of all the above prosecution witnesses in respect of hearing the verbal dying declaration of the deceased and running away the accused Nurul Kabir are consistent, uniform and corroborative with material particulars. So the same are invulnerable to the credibility....(65)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Criminal Trial </strong><br/><strong>It is true that the case was investigated twice by the two investigating officers so obviously the examination of the witnesses will occur in two different occasions. So the same will not prejudice the accused in any manner. Furthermore there are some minor discrepancies in respect of circumstantial facts which can not be denoted as contradictions and affected the merit of the case. With that regard we must bear in mind that the discrepancies have to be distinguished from the contradictions whereas contradictions in the statements of witnesses may be fatal for the prosecution but minor discrepancies in evidence will not make the prosecution case doubtful where the discrepancies are of minor character and do not go to the root of the prosecution story and do not shake the basic version of the witnesses, they need not be given much more importance and their testimony should not be jettisoned....(66)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Criminal Trial</strong><br/><strong>It appears that the defence unsuccessfully tried to make out the case that blood stained earth was not seized at the relevant time but it is in the evidence that it was diminished by walking and I.O. did not find it at or about the time of occurrence. Moreover the learned Counsel repeatedly urged that the gun fire was inflicted from the back but the post-mortem report does not support the same. So, we are unable to accept it. Therefore, we find the complicity of the accused Nurul Kabir with crime of murder is well proved and the Court below rightly and legally convicted him....(67)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)</strong><br/><strong>Section 376</strong><br/><strong>The condemned-prisoner was aged about 28 years when he was examined under Section 342 Cr.P.C. The record indicates that the condemned prisoner is not a hard criminal, he cannot be at all characterized to be a menace to the society. Taking an account of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, ends of justice will be met if death sentence is altered to one of imprisonment for life. Condemned prisoner Nurul Kabir, thus stands sentenced to imprisonment for life. ...(68)</strong><br/><br/><em>Sanwar Hossain Vs.

Ziaul Karim, J:</u></strong></span><br/><br/>This Death Reference under Section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been made by the learned Judge of Divisional Druto Bichar Tribunal, Chittagong (briefly as Tribunal) for confirmation of death sentence of condemned-prisoner.<br/><br/>By the Criminal appeal no. 3778 of 2009 and Jail Appeal No. 1055 of 2005 the convict-appellant has challenged the legality and propriety of the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 30-08-2005 passed by learned Judge of Tribunal, in Druto Bichar Case no. 10 of 2005 convicting the appellant under Section 302 of the Penal Code and sentencing him to death by hanging. By the same judgment the learned Judge acquitted the other co-accused Manjur Alam alias Manju from the charge.  Against which the informant as appellant preferred Criminal appeal no. 4347 of 2005.<br/><br/>The Death Reference and all these appeals having arisen out of the common judgment, these have been heard together and are being disposed of by this judgment.<br/><br/>The prosecution case put in a nutshell are that on 15-12-2001 at 9.15 p.m. Jahir Ahmed (P.W.1) and his manager of salt crashing factory Mr. Jaker Ahmed (P.W.7) were discussing about business affairs at his house. At that time his brother Syed Karim alias Latkaia (since deceased) was passing towards east through the courtyard by motor cycle (briefly as P.O.). Having had heard the gun fire and screaming of his brother, he along with Jaker Ahmed(P.W.7), father Haji Abdul Karim Sikder(P.W.3), mother Rowshan Ara Begum alias Rowshan (P.W.2), brother Muslem and deceased’s wife Most. Joinab Begum(P.W.4) rushed to the scene to whom the victim disclosed that Nurul Kabir son of Haji Siddique Ahmed of village Maddya Napitkhali, inflicted gun fire to him(victim) and ran away. They also witnessed the assailant Nurul Kabir retreating and identified him by the electric light. They carried the victim to Malumghat Christian hospital wherein the attending doctor declared him dead. After occurrence the locals namely Shah Alam, Md. Hefajat Ulla (P.W. 5), Shahabuddin (P.W. 10), Faridul Alam (P.W. 6), Jafer Ahmed(P.W.9) happened at the scene who also disclosed that prior to occurrence accused Monjur Alam was roaming around the P.O. and they found accused Nurul Kabir running away. The reasons behind such murder might be the sequel to the conflict between the deceased and accused Monjur Alam over non-payment of borrowed money by later who later on managed to commit murder by accused Nurul Kabir. The prosecution was launched by lodging a first information report (briefly as F.I.R.) by the elder brother of deceased Jahir Ahmed as informant which was recorded as Cox’s Bazar Police Station Case no. 12(12)2001 corresponding to G.R. no. 444 of 2001.<br/><br/>The Police after investigation submitted charge sheet under Sections 302, 109 of the Penal Code accusing two accused namely Nurul Kabir and Monjur Alam.<br/><br/>Eventually the accused were called upon to answer the charge under Sections 302, 34 of the Penal Code to which the accused on dock pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/><br/>In course of trial the prosecution in all, produced 15 witnesses, of them examined 14 witnesses and P.W. 3 was tendered  by the prosecution and defence declined to cross-examine him.<br/><br/>After closure of the prosecution case the accused were examined under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure again they repeated their innocence and led no evidence in defence.<br/><br/>The defence case as it appears from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses are that of innocence and false implication. It is divulged in defence that the deceased have been killed by unknown assailants but due to previous internal feud they were falsely implicated out of vengence by their local rivals.<br/><br/>After trial the learned Judge of the Court below convicted the accused as aforesaid.<br/><br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General  appearing for the State supports the reference and submits that the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence based on evidence on record. He adds that the deceased Syed Karim made a verbal dying declaration narrating the complicity of accused Nurul Kabir and the same was corroborated by the witnesses who also found that accused Nurul Kabir was retreating. He further submits that the injuries received by the victim were corroborated with the injuries shown in the inquest report. Therefore the conviction and sentence calls for no interference by this Court.<br/><br/>The learned Counsels appearing for the condemned prisoner by their common contentions seek to impeach the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence on the four fold arguments:<br/><br/><u><strong>Firstly:</strong></u> Prima-facie it appears that the victim received the gun–shot injury at the back, so it was impossible for him to identify the assailants and according to him recognition was absolutely doubtful.<br/><br/><u><strong>Secondly:</strong></u> Most of the witnesses categorically stated that at the time of occurrence blood of the deceased fell down but the investigating officer (briefly as I.O.) failed to seize blood stained earth from the P.O. which cast a serious doubt upon the manner of occurrence.<br/><br/><u><strong>Thirdly: </strong></u>Some of the witnesses were examined by the I.O. after long time. So their evidence cannot be relied in convicting the accused.<br/><br/>In support of their contentions, the learned Counsels refer the case of Sanwar Hossain Vs. State 45 DLR 489 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Inordinate delay in examining impo-rtant prosecution witnesses casts a serious doubt as to the truth of the prosecution case and in such circums-tances their evidence is to be left out of consideration.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><u><strong>Fourthly:</strong></u> The defence even if fails to establish his case but the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.<br/><br/>In support of their contentions they refer the case of Shadat Ali and another Vs. State 44 DLR 217 held: </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“ Even if the defence fails to establish its case that will not make the prosecution case proved as the burden of proof on the prosecution never shifts.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The learned Counsels lastly submit that there are material contradictions between the testimony of the alleged eye witnesses. So it is very unsafe to rely on it. So the conviction and sentence cannot be sustained in the eye of law.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate appearing for the informant-appellant submits that the most of the local witnesses categorically stated about the complicity of accused Monjur Alam in this case. He adds that there was long standing business transactions between him and deceased who conspired the whole crime and abated accused Nurul Kabir and there is no mismatch or distinction between the convict and acquitted accused but the Court below without considering the evidence on record acquitted the accused Manjur Alam causing miscarriage of justice.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate appearing for the respondent no.2, Manjur Alam submits that there is no evidence in respect of abating the accused Nurul Kabir by accused Manjur Alam and the prosecution measurably failed to make a nexus between him and crime of murder. The Court below rightly considered the insufficient evidence and acquitted him which calls for no interference by this Court.<br/><br/>In order to appreciate their submissions we have gone through the record and given our anxious considerations to their submissions.<br/><br/>It is indisputable that slain Syed Karim was lynched by receiving gun shot injuries.<br/><br/>Now the question calls for consideration, is, whether the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence can be sustained in the eye of law.<br/><br/>Let us now weigh and sift the evidence on record adduced by the prosecution to prove the charge.<br/><br/>P.W.1, Jahir Ahmed is the informant and elder brother of deceased Syed Karim. He deposed that on 15-12-2001 at 9.00 p.m. he along with his Manager Zaker Ahamed was discussing about business.

On 08-08-2002 for the first time he went to the place of occurrence. He examined P.W. 5 Md. Hefajat ULlah on 20-12-2002, who did not state to him that Monjur Alam carried weapons. P.W. 6 Faridul Alam did not state to him that Monjur Alam was carrying arms and running away. He examined PW.2 on 18-10-2002. He examined P.W. 4 Joinab Begum on 13-10-2002 who did not state to him that Muslem, Farid, Monjur were in P.O. P.W. 7 Jaker Ahmed did not state to him that he identified accused Monjur Alam by electric light and after occurrence Shah Alam, Shahjalal, Hefajatullah master happened at the P.O. P.W. 8 Shahjalal did not state to him that at 9/9-30 he was going to the residence of Syed Karim, P.W. 9 Jafar Ahmed did not state to him that Shahjalal, Shah Alam, Hefajatullah happened at the P.O. and identified the accused by torch light. He denied the suggestion that without proper investigation he submitted a perfunctory report.<br/><br/>These are all of the evidence on record adduced by the prosecution to prove the charge.<br/><br/>On appraisal of the evidence on record it transpires that in course of trial prosecution in all examined 14 witnesses, of them P.W.1 is the informant. P.Ws. 2-4 happened at the scene and heard the verbal dying declaration of the deceased Syed Karim. P.W.5 was a local witness but he was declared hostile by the prosecution. P.Ws. 6,7,9, 10, 12 are the local witnesses. P.W. 11 held autopsy upon the cadaver. P.W. 13 is the witness of the inquest report. P.W. 14 and 15 are the investigating officers who submitted charge sheets.<br/><br/>It is pertinent to point out that the prosecution case absolutely rest on verbal dying declaration of the deceased Syed Karim and P.Ws. 1,2,4,6,7,9,11,12 and 13 were examined to corroborate the dying declaration.<br/>At the very outset and for the convenience of understanding section 32 of the Evidence Act reads as hereunder:<br/><br/><em>Section-32 : Case, in which statement of relevant fact by person who is dead or cannot be found, etc, is relevant.- Statements, written or verbal, of relevant facts made by a person who is dead ,or who cannot be found, or who has become incapable of giving evidence, or whose attendance cannot be procured without an  amount of delay or expense which under the circumstances of the case appears to the Court unreasonable, are themselves relevant  facts  in the following cases:</em><br/><em>        (1) When the statement is made by a person as to the cause of his death, or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death, in cases in which the cause of that person’s death comes into question.</em><br/><em>        Such statements are relevant whether the person who made was or not; at the time when were made, under expectation of death, and whatever may be nature of the proceeding in which the cause of this death comes into question.”</em></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">……………………………………………</li><li style="text-align: justify;">.…………………………………………….</li><li style="text-align: justify;">.…………………………………………….</li><li style="text-align: justify;">.…………………………………………….</li><li style="text-align: justify;">.…………………………………………….</li><li style="text-align: justify;">..……………………………………………..</li><li style="text-align: justify;">.……………………………………………..</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>The principles governing dying declaration were summed up as under:</em></div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>It is neither a rule of law nor of prudence that a dying declaration cannot be acted upon without corroboration (Mannu Raja v.

Madan Mohan A 1989, SC 1519: 1989 Cri LJ 1485).</em></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Dying declaration if found acceptable alone can form the foundation for a conviction. The General rule is that all oral evidence must be direct viz, if it refers to a fact which could be seen it must be the evidence of the witness who says he saw it; if it refers to a fact which could be heard, it must be the evidence of the witness who says he heard it, if it refers to a fact which could be perceived by any other sense, it must be the evidence of the witness who says he perceived it by that sense. Similar is the case with opinion. These aspects are elaborated in S. 60. The eight clauses of S.32 are exceptions to the general rule against hearsay just stated. Clause (1) of Section 32 makes relevant what is generally described as dying declaration, though such an expression has not been used in any statute. It essentially means statements made by a person as to the cause of his death or as to the circumstances of the transaction resulting in his death. The grounds of admission are: firstly, necessity for the victim being generally the only principal eye-witness to the crime, the exclusion of the statement might defeat the ends of justice and, secondly, the sense of impending death, which creates a sanction equal to the obligation of an oath. The general principle on which this species of evidence is admitted is that they are declarations made in extremity, when the party is at the point of death and when every hope of this world is gone, when every motive to falsehood is silenced, and the mind is induced by the most powerful considerations to speak the truth; a situation so solemn and so lawful is considered by the law as creating an obligation equal to that which is imposed by a positive oath administered in a Court of justice. These aspects have been eloquently stated by Eyre L CR in R.V. Wood Cock(1789) 1 Leach 500.<br/> <br/>The situation in which a man is on death bed is so solemn and screen when he is dying that the grave position in which he is placed, is the reason in law to accept inveracity of his statement. It is for this reason the requirements of oath and cross-examination are dispensed with. Besides, should the dying declaration be excluded it will result in miscarriage of justice  because the victim being generally the only eye witnesses in a serious crime, the exclusion of the statement would leave the Court without a scrap of evidence.<br/> <br/>Though a dying declaration is entitled to a great weight, it is worthwhile to note that the accused has no power of cross-examination. Such a power is essential for eliciting the truth as an obligation of oath could be. This is the reason the Court also insists that the dying declaration should be of such a nature as to inspire full confidence of the Court in its correctness. The Court has to be on guard that the statement of deceased was not as a result of either tutoring, or prompting or a product of imagination. The Court must be further satisfied that the deceased was in a fit state of mind after a clear opportunity to observe and identify the assailants. Once the Court is satisfied that the declaration was true and voluntary, undoubtedly, it can base its conviction without any further corroboration. It cannot be laid down as an absolute rule of law that the dying declaration cannot form the sole basis of conviction unless it is corroborated. The rule requiring corrobor-ation is merely a rule of prudence.<br/> <br/>Dying declaration if found acceptable alone can form the foundation for a conviction. The rule requiring corroboration is merely a rule of prudence.<br/><br/>In the case of Salim(Md.) V. State 54 DLR -359 held :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The dying declaration of victim has not been reduced to writing, yet when it has been proved by overwh-elmming ocular evidence to prove the guilt of accused-appellant, the dying declaration of victim itself stands out as a strong piece of evidence proving the guilt of the appellant.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>P.W.1, brother of the deceased, having had heard the gun-fire and screaming of the deceased rushed to the P.O. along with others namely P.Ws.2, 4 and 7, to whom the victim Syed Karim stated that accused Nurul Kabir inflicted gun fire and running away. They also found accused Nurul Kabir running away towards north. Later on P.Ws. 6 and 9 happened at the scene they also found the accused Nurul Kabir running away and heard that the accused Nurul Kabir inflicted gun-fire upon deceased Syed Karim. So the evidence of all the above prosecution witnesses in respect of hearing the verbal dying declaration of the deceased and running away the accused Nurul Kabir are consistent, uniform and corroborative with material particulars. There is absolutely no reason to disbelieve the consistent and corroborative evidence of those competent witnesses, having no reason whatsoever to depose falsely against the condemned-prisoner. The defence extensively cross-examined them but nothing could be elicited to shake their credibility in any manner whatsoever. So the same are invulnerable to the credibility.<br/>It is true that the case was investigated twice by the two investigating officers so obviously the examination of the witnesses will occur in two different occasions. So the same will not prejudice the accused in any manner. Furthermore there are some minor discrepa-ncies in respect of circumstantial facts which can not be denoted as contradictions and affe-cted the merit of the case. With that regard we must bear in mind that the discrepancies have to be distinguished from the contradict-ions whereas contradictions in the statements of witnesses may be fatal for the prosecution but minor discrepancies in evidence will not make the prosecution case doubtful where the discrepancies are of minor character and do not go to the root of the prosecution story and do not shake the basic version of the witnesses, they need not be given much more importance and their testimony should not be jettisoned.<br/><br/>It appears that the defence unsuccessfully tried to make out the case that blood stained earth was not seized at the relevant time but it is in the evidence that it was diminished by walking and I.O. did not find it at or about the time of occurrence. Moreover the learned Counsel repeatedly urged that the gun fire was inflicted from the back but the post-mortem report does not support the same. So, we are unable to accept it. Therefore, we find the complicity of the accused Nurul Kabir with crime of murder is well proved and the Court below rightly and legally convicted him.<br/><br/>Moreover the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence in its entirety is well founded in the facts and circumstances of the case. So the grounds urged and contentions advanced by the learned Counsel for the condemned prisoner are not the correct exposition of law. However, the condemned-prisoner was aged about 28 years when he was examined under Section 342 Cr.P.C. The record indicates that the condemned prisoner is not a hard criminal, he cannot be at all characterised to be a menace to the society. Taking an account of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, ends of justice will be met if death sentence is altered to one of imprisonment for life. Condemned prisoner Nurul Kabir, thus stands sentenced to imprisonment for life.<br/><br/>In the light of discussions made above we find no evidence against Monjur Alam for abating accused Nurul Kabir to commit murder of deceased Syed Karim. Most of the witnesses merely stated that the accused Monjur Alam was roaming around the place of occurrence for certain moment but the deceased Syed Karim himself did not disclose such fact to his inmates and other neighbouring witnesses. So we failed to discover any merit in Criminal appeal no. 4347 of 2005.<br/><br/>In the result the reference is rejected with a modification of sentence to the above terms;<br/><br/>The Criminal appeal no. 3778 of 2009 and Jail appeal no. 1055 of 2005 are allowed in part with a modification to the effect that the condemned prisoner Nurul Kabir is convicted under Section 302 of the Penal Code and sentenced to suffer imprisonment for life.<br/><br/>In view of the provisions laid down in Section 35A(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure the total period the condemned prisoner have been in the custody before conviction in connection with this offence shall be deducted from the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to him.<br/><br/>Criminal appeal no. 4347 of 2005 is dismissed.<br/><br/>The office is directed to send down the records at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
