Accused Sani Ahmed Sentu being enlarged on bail remained absconding. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">This death reference and the above appeals having arisen out of a common judgment, these have been heard together and are being disposed of by this judgment.<br/> <br/>The prosecution case put in a nutshell are that on 03-01-2005 at 09:25 a.m. S.I. Khandaker Halim of Bahubal Police Station (P.W.1) made an inquiry on an information recorded in G.D.E. no. 76 dated 03-01-2005 and found that two unknown male dead-bodies were lying at the eastern side of Dhaka-Sylhet high-way in between Daulatpur and Jashpal village (briefly as P.O.). The bodies bore ligature marks on the neck. It was suspected that the death was caused by strangulation. Meanwhile at 10:25 a.m. Advocate Bashir Ahmed Dulal (P.W.3) of Hobigonj Court happened at the scene and identified the dead-bodies as Babul and Ashraf Ali, driver and helper respectively of his micro-bus no. Dhaka-Metro-N-12-1590. He (P.W.3) informed that on 02-01-2005 at 2:30 p.m. driver and helper went to Chunarughat from his village Nizgaon with a passenger trip but they did not return in time. He unsuccessfully searched them. On 03-01-2005 at 9:00 a.m. he received an information of dead-bodies lying at the P.O. The locals were whispering that they found at 4:30 p.m. Sujon of village Nizgaon with his accomplice were roaming who were suspected to commit the crime of murder.  With these allegations the prosecution was launched by lodging a first information report (briefly as FIR) by S.I. Khandaker Halim (P.W.1) as informant which was recorded as Bahubal P.S. Case no. 03 date 03-01-2005 corresponding to G.R. no. 03 of 2005.<br/><br/>During investigation accused Sujon Deb, Borhanuddin, Afsaruddin alias Afsu, Sohel Khan, and Sani Ahmed Sentu made confessions before the learned Magistrate implicating theirselves along with accused Salam and Kalam.<br/>The Police after investigation submitted charge sheet under Sections 302,379,34,411 of the Penal Code accusing accused.<br/><br/>Eventually accused were called upon to answer the charge under Sections 302,34,379 and 411 of the Penal Code to which the accused on dock pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/>In course of trial the prosecution in all examined twenty witnesses out of twenty nine charge sheeted witnesses. Two witnesses were tendered by the prosecution. The defence examined none. <br/>After closure of prosecution case, the accused were examined under Section 342 of the Code, again they repeated their innocence and led no evidence in defence.<br/>The defence case as it appears from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses are that of innocence and false implication. It was divulged in defence that confession of Sujon deb was extracted by putting him in torture.<br/><br/>After trial the accused were convicted as aforesaid holding that:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(a)  The confession of accused Sujon deb is true and voluntary who disclosed the names of accused Salam, Kalam and also the others accused;<br/>(b) The stolen micro-bus was recovered from the possession of accused;<br/>(c) There are corroborative evidence against the accused. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the State supports the reference and submits that soon after the occurrence arrestees Sujon deb and four others made confessions. He adds that confessions are true and voluntary and there are corroborative evidence against the accused. He submits that PWs. 8 and 19 stated that accused Sujon deb disclosed the names of accused Kalam and Salam before them. So the Court below after considering  the materials on record rightly convicted the accused which calls for no interference by this Court.<br/> <br/>The learned Counsels appearing for the condemned-prisoners and appellants by their common contention seek to impeach the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence on five fold arguments:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong><u>Firstly :</u></strong> The  confession of Sujon deb was extracted by torture and the same is exculpatory in nature.<br/><strong><u>Secondly:</u></strong>  The deceaseds were killed by their negligence and fault. In support of their contention they refer the case of State Vs. Lalu Mia and others 39 DLR(AD)-117 held:<br/><strong>“</strong><em>confession- Exculpatory and inculpatory</em><em> confessions- Extent to which exculpatory confession can be  taken into consideration in judging truth or otherwise of the whole confession.</em><br/><em>Where there is no other evidence to show affirmatively that any portion of the exculpatory element in the confession is false, the Court must accept or reject the confession as a whole and cannot accept only the inculpatory element while rejecting the exculpatory element as inherently incredible.”</em><br/><strong><u>Thirdly:</u></strong> The condemned-prisoners had no intention to murder the deceased.<br/><strong><u>Fourthly</u></strong>: The Court below convicted the accused relying the confessions of co-accused which cannot be sustained in law<br/><strong><u>Fifthly:</u></strong> The Judgment and order of conviction and sentence based on misreading and non-consideration of the evidence on record which cannot be sustained in the eye of law.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In order to appreciate their submissions we have gone through the record and given our anxious consideration to their submissions.<br/>Let us now weigh and sift the evidence on record as adduced by the prosecution to prove the charge.<br/><br/>P.W.1, S.

P.W.22 lastly investigated the case and submitted charge sheet.<br/><br/>We should bear in mind, credibility of testimony oral and circumstantial, depends considerably on a judicial evaluation of the totality, not isolated scrutiny. When dealing with the serious question of guilt or innocence of persons charged with crime, the following principles should be taken into consideration.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">a) The onus of proving everything essential to the establishment of the charge against the accused lies on the prosecutor.<br/>b) The evidence must be such asto exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.<br/>c)  In matters of doubt it is safer to acquit than to condemn, for it is better that several guilty persons should escape than that one innocent person suffer.<br/>d) There must be clear and unequivocal proof of the corpus delicit.<br/>e) The hypothesis of delinquency should be consistent with all the facts proved.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Inspite of the presumption of truth attached to oral evidence under oath if the Court is not satisfied, the evidence inspite of oath is of no avail.<br/>It is true that there is no eye witness to the occurrence but the case is absolutely rest upon the confessions of accused Sujon, Borhan, Afsar uddin, Sohel Khan and Sani Ahmed Sentu [Exhbts.4,4(L),4(M), 4(N),4(O)].<br/>The material excerpt of confession of Sujon deb( Exhbt. 4) reads as hereunder:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;

The dead-bodies of deceaseds were found at the P.O. on 03-01-2005 in the morning. On the same day at 10:35 a.m. FIR was lodged by P.W.1. He (P.W.1) categorically stated that on 04-01-2005 he arrested accused Sujon from his in-law’s house. According to his confession he arrested accused Sohel on 05-01-2005 and seized one Audio Cassette player (Exhbt. 3(L) which was affixed to the micro-bus. He also stated that the deceaseds were identified by Advocate Bashir Ahmed Dulal (P.W.3) as his driver Babul and helper Ashab Ali of his micro-bus bearing no. Dhaka-metro N-12-1590 which was ultimately given to the jimma of P.W. 3. Later, accused Sohel was interrogated who informed to him that on 03-01-2005 at 5:30 p.m. accused Sujon and his accomplice Salam and Sylheti Kalam came to him to sale the stolen micro-bus. Later, with the help of accused Borhan and Afsar he managed to sale it to Suny Ahmed Sentu at the price of Tk.44,000/-. The stolen micro-bus was handed over to Suny in Sineboard area. Subsequently he arrested accused Sentu and at his showing the micro-bus was recovered from the house of Mofizuddin. Thereafter on 06-01-2005 the accused Sujon made confession (Exhbt.4), the contents of it is absolutely corroborative with the evidence of P.W.1 and such confession was recorded by P.W.12 after complying all legal formalities laid down in Section 364 of the Code. The accused Sujon deb did not complain regarding torture or coercion or allurement.  But at the later stage of trial accused Sujon deb raised a plea that by alluring him such confession was extracted.  The plea raised by him has no leg to stand and as such the defence having not deliberately led any evidence, in support of his pseudo plea, so it recoils against him. Moreover PWs. 2, 4-6, 8, 11, 17, 18, 19 were examined to corroborate the evidence of above witnesses. They categor-ically corroborated their evidence. However all the PWs. were extensively cross examined by the defence but nothing could be elucidated to shake their credibility in any manner whatso-ever. Therefore, such pseudo plea should be left out of consideration.<br/><br/>On critical analysis of the evidence on record along with the confession of accused Sujon deb we find that at the instance of Salam he ( Sujon deb) took over the seat of the driver of micro-bus and drived the car and at night he reached to his in-laws house wherein they took meal allowing time to reach Kalam to there. Thereafter they started to their destination. In view of such facts we hold that the confession of Sujon deb is true, voluntary and inculpatory voluntary in nature.<br/><br/>It further appears to us that above confessing accused implicated himself in commission of murdering. The materials on record shows that his confession was shown as voluntary and inculpatory in nature. So it is well established that confessional statement if found inculpatory in nature and also true and voluntary it can be used against its maker and conviction can solely be based on it without any further corroborative evidence. <br/><br/>In the instant case the confession made by accused Sujon deb (Exhbt.4) was not only inculpatory in nature, but also true and voluntary and as such the Tribunal very rightly based solely on the confession and correctly convicted and sentenced the above accused by the impugned judgment and order, having duly found him guilty for the offence committed under Sections 302, 34 of the Penal Code.<br/>In the case of Islam Uddin (Md.) alias Din Islam  Vs. The State 13 BLC (AD)81 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“It is now settled principle of law that <em>Judicial confession if it is found to be true and voluntary can form the sole basis of conviction as against the maker of the same. The High Court Division has rightly found the judicial confession of the condemned-prisoner true and voluntary and considering the same, the extra judicial confession and, circumstances of the case, found the condemned-prisoner guilty and accordingly imposed the sentence of death upon him. ”  </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Similar views were taken in the cases of Abdur Rashid and others Vs. The State 3 BLD 206, Amir Hossain Vs. The State 6 BLD (AD)193, Gouranga Chandra Paul Vs. The State 59 DLR 17, 29 DLR(SC)27, Shajahan Ali (Md.) alias Md. Shahjahan Vs. The State 59 DLR 396, Hazrat Ali  and others Vs. The State 44 DLR (AD) 51, The State Vs. Abul Kalam Azad and others 8 BLC 464. Therefore we hold that the Court below rightly convicted the condemned prisoner Sujon deb after considering the evidence on record.<br/><br/>The complicity of the accused Sujon deb was also corroborated by P.Ws. 8 and 19 who categorically stated that accused Sujon deb stated in their presence that he along with accused Salam and Kalam strangulated the deceaseds to death.<br/><br/>It is true that confessions of co-accused is not a substantive peace of evidence against other co-accused who did not confess but in this case it appears to us that soon-after the occurrence the accused Salam and Kalam remained absconding. After occurrence accused Sujon made confession on 06-01-2005 disclosing  the complicity of accused Salam and Kalam. So those accused had responsi-bilities to discharge their duties and explain their position towards the occurrence but they did not do so.<br/><br/>Abscondence of an accused is an incriminating circumstances connecting him in the offence and conduct of a person in abscondence after commission of crime is an evidence to show that he is concerned in the offence (Vide PLD 1965 Lah. 656). Therefore, anything, which tends to explain his conduct and furnishes a motive other than a guilty conscience, will be relevant under the Evidence Act. Failure to explain reason for absconding after occurrence favours prosecution (39 DLR 437). Abscondence of accused is a relevant fact. Unless accused explain his conduct, abscondence may indicate guilt of accused (33 DLR 274). Where accused absconded immediately after occurrence and remained out of reach of hand of law for more than years without showing any convincing reason for his absence, it would be an important factor going against absconder accused (AIR-1998 SC-107). Abscondence immediately after incident and trial in absentia and abscondence till today is a strong incriminating circumstances while can be considered sufficient corroboration of his participation in commission of crime (11 BLT 155).<br/><br/>Therefore, we hold that accused Salam and Kalam are squarely responsible for committing the murder of deceaseds with Sujon deb.<br/>The credit to be given to the statement of a witness is a matter not regulated by rule of procedure, but depends upon his knowledge of fact to which he testifies his disinterestedness, his integrity and his veracity. Apportion of oral evidence depends on such variable in consistence which as a human nature cannot be reduced as a set formula (40 DLR 58).<br/>The weight to be attached to the testimony of witness depends in a large measure upon various consideration some of which are in the face of it his evidence should be in consonance with probabilities and consistent with other evidence, and should generally so fit in with material details of the case for the prosecution as to carry conviction of truth to a prudent mind. In a word evidence of a witness is to be looked at from point of view of its credibility, it is quite unsafe to discard evidence of witness which otherwise appears reasonable and probable because of some suggestion against truthfulness of the witness.<br/>Evidence of close relations of the victim cannot be discarded more particularly when close relations does not impair the same. Straightforward evidence given by witness who is related to deceased cannot be rejected on sole ground that they are interested in prosecution. Ordinarily close relation will be last person to screen real culprit and falsely implicate a person. So relationship far from being ground of criticism is often a sure guarantee of its truth( 40 DLR 58).<br/>On appraisal of the evidence on record we find that P.W.1 arrested accused Sohel and seized record player of the stolen micro-bus from his house. The micro-bus was sold at the instance of Afsar Uddin and Borhanuddin to accused Sentu. Later, it was recovered from the house of Mafizuddin shown by Sentu. The accused Suhel, Borhanuddin, Afsar and Sentu were found responsible for keeping the stolen micro-bus in their possession and its selling.  Their confessions also indicate their complicity as to keeping and selling the micro-bus. Therefore, the offence against them under Section 411 was well proved.<br/>In view of such facts, the evidence regarding taking away, micro-bus, murdering the deceaseds and recovery of the micro-bus from the accused are consistent, uniform and corroborative with each other with all materials particulars. There is absolutely no reason to disbelieve the consistent and corroborative evidence of those competent witnesses having no reason whatsoever to dispose falsely against them. The defence extensively cross-examined them but nothing could be elucidated to shake their credibility in any manner whatsoever. So the same are invulnerable to the credibility. Therefore, we hold that the complicity of the accused in murdering the deceaseds and recovery of stolen micro-bus from their possession are well proved by convincing and unimpeachable evidence.<br/>Moreover, the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence in its entirety is well founded in the facts and circumstances of the case.  So the submissions advance by the learned Deputy Attorney General prevails and appears to have a good deals of force. On the contrary we failed to discover any merit in the submissions advanced by the learned Counsel for the defence.<br/><br/>In the light of discussions made above and the preponderant judicial views emerging out of the authorities referred to above, we are of the view that the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence suffers from no legal infirmities. However as to the sentence the learned Advocates for the condemned prisoners submits that there was no premediation for murder so the sentence of death should be committed. Regards being had to the facts and circumstances of the case we are of the view that the sentence of imprisonment for life will meet the ends of justice instead of death.<br/><br/>In the result:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(a) Death reference no. 63 of 2006 is rejected.  <br/>(b)  The impugned Judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 13-07-2006 passed by learned Judge of Tribunal, in Druto Bichar (Sessions) Case No. 15 of 2006 is hereby maintained with a modific-ation of sentence of condemned-prisoners to imprisonment for life instead of death under Sections 302,34 of the Penal Code and the same in respect of appellants Sohel Khan, and Borhanuddin is maintained.<br/>(b) Accordingly Criminal appeal no. 3341 of 2006 and Jail appeal no. 663 of 2006 are dismissed with a modification of sentence in the above terms.<br/>(c)  Criminal appeal no. 3462 of 2006 and 3630 of 2006 are dismissed. The convicts Sohel and Borhanuddin are directed to surrender to their respective bail bond within fifteen days from the date of receipt of this order to serve out the remaining part of sentence.<br/>d)   The learned Judge of the Court below will take appropriate step to secure the arrest of absconding condemned-prisoners Salam and Kalam and appellants Shohel Khan and Borhanuddin and commit them to jail to serve out their sentence.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The Office is directed to send down the records at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>
