Abu Zafor Siddique, J:</u></strong><br/> <br/>          This appeal is directed against the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 17/06/2009 passed by the of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, No.2, Pirojpur, in Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Case No.190 of 2007, under section 11(Ga)/30 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 (Shortly the Ain,2000) convicting the appellants under section  11(Ga)/30 of the said Ain,2000 and sentencing the appellant No.3 to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 2 years and a fine of Tk.3,000/ in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 3 months and appellants No.1 &amp; 2 to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 2 years and a fine of Tk.3,000/- in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 3 months more.<br/><br/><strong>2.</strong>         The prosecution case, in short, is that one Most. Rosy being complainant filed a petition of complaint before the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Pirojpur, alleging inter-alia, that she got married with the appellant No.3 Md. Hossain Ahmed and appellant No.1 and 2 demanded Dowry of Tk.1,00,000/- from her father but her father refused to pay the same. Thereafter the accused persons inflicted lathi blows on different parts of her body causing injury. While the neighbours came to save her and enquired about the occurrence but she told that it was their family matter. After 10 days she herself made a petition of complaint and filed before the learned judge, Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal-2, Pirojpur. After receipt of the petition of complaint, the learned Judge of the Tribunal directed the Upazila Education Officer to inquire into the matter. After inquiry a  report was submitted and thereafter the learned judge took cognizance and framed charge against the accused persons under section 11(Ga) and 30 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Ain, 2000 and the same was read over to the accused persons who pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried in accordance with law.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>     During trial the prosecution examined as many as 7 witnesses out of 8 cited witnesses in the petition of complaint while the defence examined none.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>     From the trend of cross-examination of the P.Ws the defence case is that the appellants are innocent and they have been falsely implicated with ulterior motive and the so called occurrence has not been committed by the appellants.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>     After hearing the parties and on consideration of the evidence and the materials on record and in view of the facts and circumstances of the case the learned trial Court came to the finding that the prosecution proved the charge beyond all reasonable doubt and accordingly, the Court convicted the accused-persons.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>     Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid judgment and order of conviction and sentence the appellants preferred this instant appeal.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>     No one appear on behalf of the State to oppose the appeal.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>     Mr. Md. Abdur Razzak, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants submits that the learned court below has misread the evidence and misinterpreted the law, thus, passed the judgment and order of conviction which is not at all tenable in the eye of law. Mr. Razzak submits that the appellants are innocent and they had been falsely implicated out of social enmity and ulterior motive. He further submitted that the alleged occurrence took place on 27-10-2007 but the petition of complaint was filed on 05-11-2008 without assigning any reason, for such delay, which creates serious doubt in the prosecution case, as such, the instant case is malafide one. He has contended that not a single independent witness was examined to support the prosecution case and all the P.Ws are close relatives of the complainant. Mr. Razzak has drawn my attention to the examination of the appellants under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and submits that the terms and conditions of examining of the accused under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has not been followed, as such, the accused appellants has been highly prejudiced. In support of his submission Mr. Md. Abdur Razzak referred the case reported in 54 DLR(AD) 60, 60 DLR(HCD) 371 and AIR 1972 (SC) 535.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>     Let me now discuss the relevant evidence, other materials on record together with the attending facts and circumstances of this case as well as the provision of law to ascertain whether the Tribunal has committed any illegality or abuse of process of the law in passing the judgment and order of the conviction and sentence.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>   P.W-1, Most. Rosy is the complainant and victim of the case. During her examination in chief, she supported her petition of complaint. In her cross-examination she denied all the suggestions given by the defence.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>   P.W-2, Kazal Begum is a hearsay witness. She knew nothing about the occurrence and she was also the wife of the full brother of the victim.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>   P.W-3, Md. Humayun Kabir is the full brother of the victim and he deposed that he knew nothing about the occurrence and he is also a hearsay witness.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>   P.W-4, Mozammel Khan is the father of the victim. He is also a hearsay witness. He stated that on 27/10/2000 in the evening the informant informed him that his son-in-law demanded Tk.1,00,000/- as dowry and for that reason he tortured her at the instigation of accused Nos.2 and 3 and at that time his wife, children and other relatives were present in the house.  In his cross-examinations he denied all the suggestions given by the defence.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>   P.W.-5, Babul Sk. is a Rickshaw Puller. He carried the victim on his Rickshaw. He deposed that- while the informant was going by his rickshaw disclosed that her husband tortured her on demand of dowry Tk. 1,00,000/-.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>   P.W-6, Md. Younus Akon is a local businessman. He supported the prosecution case. He deposed, that while he was passing the residence of the informant he heard hue and cry, then he went into the house and found that accused No.1 tortured the informant for demand of Tk.1,00,000/- as dowry. He also stated while he was entering into the residence someone told him the accused was beating his wife on demand of dowry.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>   P.W-7, Dr. Ratan Kumar Dhali is a Medical Officer of the Upazila Health complex, Nazirpur, District Pirojpur. He supported his Medical Certificate and the same was marked as Exhibit. In his cross-examination he denied the suggestions given by the defence.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>   These are the evidence adduced by the prosecution.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>   From the plain reading of evidence it appears to me that all the witnesses are close relatives and this facts has been corroborated by P.W.1, the victim herself. In cross examination the victim has categorically stated. “স্বাক্ষী মোজাম্মেল খান আমার পিতা, স্বাক্ষী রেবা খানম আমার বোন, স্বাক্ষী কাজল বেগম আমার ভাবী, স্বাক্ষী মিজানুর ও হুমায়ন কবির আমার ভাই। স্বাক্ষী শাহজাহান শেখ আমার প্রতিবেশী।” Though there were other neighbours but none of them came forward to depose in support of the complainant in any manner and this situation has created serious doubt in the prosecution case.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>   After closing of evidence the learned Judge examined the accused appellants under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>   I have gone through the examination of appellant No.3, under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which runs as follows :-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“প্রশ্নঃ ১। আপনি মোঃ হোসেন আহম্মেদ বিগত ২৭/১০/২০০৭ ইং তারিখ বিকাল অনুমান ৫.৩০ মিনিটের সময় পিরোজপুর থানাধীন কলাখালি সাকিনের বসতগৃহে বসিয়া আপনার স্বাক্ষী মোছাঃ রোজি বাদী সংবাদ দাতাকে তাহার পিতার নিকট হইতে ১,০০,০০০/- টাকা আনিয়া দিবার দাবী করিয়াছেন। বাদীনি তাহার পিতার নিকট হইতে যৌতুক আনিয়া দেওয়া সম্ভব নয় জানাইলে আপনি আপনার স্বাক্ষী মোছাঃ রোজী আক্তারকে মারপিট করিয়া ঘর হইতে তাড়াইয়া দেন। পি, ডব্লিউ-১ মোছাঃ রোজি আক্তার আপনার বিরুদ্ধে স্বাক্ষ্য প্রদান করেন। পি,ডব্লিউ-২, কাজল বেগম, পি,ডব্লিউ-৩ মোঃ হুমায়ুন কবির, পি,ডব্লিউ-৪ মোজাম্মেল খান, পি,ডব্লিউ-৫ মোঃ বাবুল সেখ, পি,ডব্লিউ-৬ মোঃ ইউনুছ আকন এবং পি,ডব্লিউ-৭ ডাঃ রতন কুমার ঢালী প্রত্যেকই পি, ডব্লিউ ১ বাদী সংবাদ দাতার স্বাক্ষী এবং নালিশী দরখাস্ত সমর্থন করিয়াছেন। ইহা দ্বারা আপনি নারী ও শিশু নির্যাতন দমন আইন ২০০০ এবং ২০০৩ সনের সংশোধিত আইনের ১১ (গ) ধারায় শাস্তি যোগ্য অপরাধ করিয়াছেন। রাস্ট্র পক্ষ অত্র মামলায় ৭ জন স্বাক্ষী আদালতে হাজির করিয়াছেন। আপনি উহা ডকে দাঁড়াইয়া শুনিয়াছেন। ইহাতে আপনার বক্তব্য কি?<br/>উত্তরঃ আমি নির্দোষ।<br/>প্রশ্নঃ আপনি কোন কাগজপত্র দাখিল করিবেন কি?<br/>উত্তরঃ না।<br/>প্রশ্নঃ আপনি ছাফাই স্বাক্ষ্য দেওয়াইবেন কি?<br/>উত্তরঃ না।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>21.</strong>   The two other accused persons also examined under section 342 of the Code in the same way.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>   From the plain reading of the above statement it appears that it was done in a slip short manner. It appears that at the time of examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the trial court failed to put the incriminating evidence against the convict-appellants for the purpose of enabling them to explain the circumstance and thereby the convict-appellants have been highly prejudiced.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>   In the case of State -Vs-Monu Miah and others, reported in DLR(AD)(2002) 60 our Apex Court held as follows;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>The Court below also found that the examination of the accused under section 342 CrPc have been perfunctory which has seriously prejudiced the accused as incriminating evidence or circumstances sought to be proved against the accused was not put to the accused during examination under section 342 CrPc causing gross miscarriage of justice. In the case of Mizazul Islam @ Dablu Vs State 41 DLR(AD) 157 sandal which was the incriminating material sought to implicate the accused was not drawn to the attention of the accused at the time of examination under section 342 CrPc and, as such, the same was left out of consideration Accordingly, it was held in that case that incriminating evidence or circumstances sought to be proved by the prosecution must be put to the accused during examination under section 342 Cr. Pc otherwise it would cause miscarriage of justice to the great prejudice of the accuse. </em>”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>24.</strong>   In the case of Shahid Mia and another -Vs- The State and another, reported in 60 DLR(HCD)371, the court held as follows;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“It appears that while examining the accused appellants under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the trial Court failed to put the incriminating evidence against the accused appellants for the purpose of enabling them to explain any circumstance and thereby the accused appellants have been prejudiced.”</em><br/><em>“Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure that the accused should be examined for the purpose of enabling him to explain any circumstance appearing in the evidence against him. But in the instant case no incriminating circumstance was put to the accused appellants”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>25.</strong>   In the decision reported in AIR 1972 (SC) 535 it has been held as follows;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The real importance of this section lies in that it imposes a duty on the court to question the accused properly and fairly so as to bring home to him the exact case he will have to meet and thereby an opportunity is given to him to explain any such point.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>26.</strong>   Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, runes as follows;<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“<u>Section 342 Power to examine the accused-</u><br/><em>1) For the purpose of enabling the accused to explain any circumstances appearing in the evidence against him the Court may, at any stage of any inquiry or trial without previously warning the accused, put such questions to him as the Court considers necessary, and shall, for the purpose aforesaid, question him generally on the case after the witnesses for the prosecution have been examined and before he is called on for his defence.</em><br/><em>2)The accused shall not render himself liable to punishment by refusing to answer such question, or by giving false answers to them; but the Court may draw such inference from such refusal or answers as it thinks just.</em><br/><em>3) The answers given by the accused may be taken into consideration in such inquiry or trial and put in evidence for or against him in any other inquiry into, or trial for, any other offence which such answers may tend to show he has committed. </em><br/><em>4) No oath shall be administered to the accused.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>27.</strong>   The first portion of this section relates to putting questions to the   accused is an enabling provision but the second portion as to the examination of the accused is imperative. This section requires that the accused to be examined for the purpose of enabling him “to explain any circumstances appearing in the evidence against him”. It seems to be extremely unfair for a Judge to rely upon a circumstance as being incriminating without giving the accused any notice of it and without giving him an opportunity of explaining the circumstances, in any manner. This provision of law imposes a duty on the court to question the accused properly and fairly so as to bring home to him the exact case he will have to face and thereby an opportunity is to be given him to explain any such point. Examination under this section is not intended to be an idle formality. It has to be carried out in the interest of justice and fair opportunity to the accused. It is intended for the protection and benefit of the accused persons and not in order to enable the prosecution to find out materials to support the prosecution case. By a slip short examination, which is the result of imperfect appreciation of the evidence, idleness or negligence, the position of the accused cannot be permitted to be made more difficult that what it is in a trial for an offence.<br/> <br/><strong>28.</strong>   The Appellate Court must always consider whether by reason of failure to comply with the procedural provision of this section, which does not affect the jurisdiction of the court accused is materially prejudiced. The object of this section is to enable the accused to explain each and every circumstance appearing in the evidence against him. This cannot be done by such a general question as ‘what have you to say’? or ‘what is your defence’? The specific point or points which weigh against the accused must be mentioned. If this is not done, he cannot be reasonably expected to be able to explain those points. The accused is to be examined after the evidence for the prosecution has been recorded. The accused must be examined after the examination, cross-examination and re-examination of all the prosecution witnesses are over.<br/> <br/><strong>29.</strong>   It appears that while examining the appellants under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the court below did not properly disclosed the incriminating evidence against the appellants who are present in dock and faced the trial. Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is based on the principle involved in the <em>“<u>Maxim audi alteram partem-that is no one should be , condemned unheard”</u></em><u> <em>It is utmost duty of the court to give an opportunity to an accused to defence himself/themselves.</em></u> The real object of section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is inviting the attention of the accused person to the points in the evidence which are against them for which they may be convicted, so, he is given a chance to offer his explanation as to those. But in this case the learned Judge of the Tribunal has not given any chance to the convict appellants in accordance with law.<br/> <br/>30.   I have carefully scrutinized of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the decisions as referred herein above and other materials on record. It appears to me that there is no legal evidence to convict the appellants. The prosecution witnesses are almost family members of the victim. P.W.-5 Md. Babul Sheikh deposed “বাদী আমার রিকসায় যাওয়ার সময় আমার কাছে বলে তাহার স্বামী ১নং আসামী ১ লক্ষ টাকা যৌতুকের দাবীতে তাহাকে মারপিট করিয়াছে।” He is mere hearsay witness of the case. P.W.-6. Md. Younus Akon claimed that – at the time of occurrence he was present there, and he has seen the occurrence. In this regards the learned Advocate of the appellants has argued that P.Ws.-5 and 6 are completely chance witnesses, that is why their evidence cannot be relied upon.<br/> <br/><strong>31.</strong>   It is well settled that the evidence of a chance witnesses is very weak type of evidence and is not considered worthy in coming to a decision in a criminal case. A chance witness is one who claimed to be present at the place of occurrence at the time of occurrence when and where he is not normally expected to be present. In the case on hand, a rickshaw puller was going to his home and at the time of crossing the place of occurrence he carried the victim on his rickshaw. He deposed as a P.W.-5 and stated that he has heard the fact that the victim was tortured for demand of dowry, which proved that he is mere hearsay witness. His evidence cannot be relied upon, in any circular.  <br/> <br/><strong>32.</strong>   As much as on the plain reading of the examining the accused appellants under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it appears that the accused persons were not given proper opportunity to offer their explanations as to the guilt for which the convict-appellants have been prejudiced.<br/> <br/><strong>33.</strong>   So, I find that the learned Judge has not applied his Judicial mind in passing the order of conviction and sentence, as, such, the same is liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/><strong>34.</strong>   Accordingly, I find merit in this appeal.<br/> <br/><strong>35.</strong>   In the result, the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed by the trial court dated 17.06.2009 in Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Case No. 190 of 2007 is hereby set aside.<br/> <br/><strong>36.</strong>   The convict appellants are acquitted from the charge levelled against them.<br/> <br/><strong>37.</strong>   The appellants be released from their respective bail bonds, forth with.<br/><br/>        Send down the Lower Court Records with a copy of the judgment at once.<br/><br/>        <strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Thereafter, on 7.5.2008 the defendant-petitioners entered appearance in the suit and filed written objection against the said order of ad-interim injunction. The learned Assistant Judge, Rajarhat, Kurigram, however, on the same day after hearing the parties by his order dated 7.5.2008 confirmed the ad-interim order of injunction dated 6.5.2008.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>     The defendant-petitioners thereafter, filed Miscellaneous Appeal No.73 of 2008 against the said order of ad-interim injunction along with a prayer for stay.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>     The learned District Judge, Kurigram after hearing the parties fixed the appeal for hearing without any order of stay. In this  background of the case the plaintiff-opposite parties filed a Violation  Miscellaneous Case stating that the defendant-petitioners  by violating Court's order cultivating the land which caused huge loss and injury to the plaintiff-opposite parties amounting to Tk.1,20,000/- in each person. The said Violation Miscellaneous Case was registered as Miscellaneous (Violation) Case No.13 of 2008.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>     The learned Assistant Judge after hearing the parties and on considering the evidence on record by order dated 23.02.2010  rejected the Miscellaneous (Violation) Case.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>     Unsuccessful, plaintiff-opposite parties, thereupon, preferred Miscellaneous Appeal No.18 of 2010. The learned District Judge, Kurigram after hearing the parties by the impugned judgment and order dated 27.4.2011 allowed the appeal and sentenced the petitioners to undergo civil imprisonment for 15 days under Order XXXIX, Rule 2(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>     Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and order dated 27.4.2011 the petitioners moved this Court and obtained the present Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>     Mrs. Nahid Mahtab, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioners after placing the deposition of witnesses and other material on record including the impugned judgment and order dated 27.4.2011  submits that the impugned judgment is not a proper judgment of reversal inasmuch as the learned District Judge without adverting any material finding of the trial Court below abruptly set-aside the order of the trial Court and sentenced to undergo civil imprisonment for 15 days  to the petitioners which resulted in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice. She next submits that the learned Assistant Judge on  due consideration of the evidence of PWs. rightly arrived at a finding that the plaintiff-opposite parties miserably failed to prove the allegation of violation against the defendant-petitioners and as such the impugned judgment of reversal is liable to be set aside. The learned Advocate further submits that the petitioner did not in any way violate or disobeyed the order of the Court and the opposite parties failed to prove that the petitioners violated the order of the Court and as such, the finding of the learned  District Judge  is palpably erroneous and not sustainable in law. The learned Advocate further submits that the impugned judgment and order is also not sustainable in view of the fact that the learned District Judge failed to come to any finding that the petitioners wilfully disobeyed the Court’s order. MS. Nahid Mahtab to fortify her argument has relied on a decision reported in 39 DLR 260.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>   On the other hand, Mr. A. F. M. Meshbahuddin, the learned Advocate appearing for the opposite parties supports the impugned judgment and order, which was according to him just, correct and proper.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>   I have considered the submission of the learned Advocates for both the sides and perused the Revisional application, impugned judgment and order along with other materials on record. It is found that the plaintiff-opposite parties in order to prove the order of violation examined 2 PWs; namely, PW-1, Advocate, Firoz Md. Faruque, who in his deposition stated that: “ঘটনার তাং আমি চিলমারী­তে ছিলাম। আরজী­তে সময় ভোর বেলা বলা অা­ছে। ঘটনা বড় ভাই­য়ের কা­ছে শু­­নছি। আমি ছিলাম না। সালাম ফো­­ন জানি­­য়­ছে। সালাম সাক্ষী আ­­ছ। ভাই সাক্ষী নাই। ৩/৪ দিন পর ঘটনাস্থলে যাই। রোপা লাগা­নো ছিল না। জমি তৈরী ছিল। ঘটনা ওসমান, সালাম এরা দে­খে­ছে। জমির পা­শের চৌহদ্দির লোক সাক্ষী আ­ছে।”<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>   PW-2, Asir Uddin Bepari in his cross-examination admitted that জমি নি­য়ে কোন মারামারি হয় নাই বা কোন ঘটনা হয় নাই।<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>   On going through the evidence of PWs, it appears that the PWs. are not eye witnesses to the occurrence. It also appears that eye witnesses were withheld by he plaintiffs without assigning any reason whatsoever. The trial Court below upon hearing the parties and on considering the evidence on record arrived at a finding that the plaintiff-opposite parties could not prove the allegation of violation by adducing corroborative or reliable evidence. Thus, on consideration of the evidence on record, I find that the plaintiff-opposite parties failed to prove the case strictly by adducing independent and reliable evidence that the defendant-petitioners disobeyed the order of injunction.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>   On a careful examination  of the impugned judgment and order together with the evidence of PWs and DWs,  it appears that the Court of appeal below without adverting the material findings of the trial Court below set-aside the order of the trial Court below and sentenced the petitioners to undergo civil imprisonment for 15 days.  Therefore, I am of the view that the impugned judgment is not a proper judgment of reversal inasmuch as the Court of appeal below without adverting the material findings of the trial Court below abruptly set- aside the order of the trial Court and sentenced the defendant-petitioners to undergo civil imprisonment for 15 days. Thus, I find considerable merit in the submission of the learned Advocate for the petitioners.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>   For the reasons stated above, I am inclined to hold that the learned District Judge seriously erred in law in passing the impugned order without properly applying his judicial mind into the facts and circumstances of the case and law bearing on the subject and the same has resulted in an error in the impugned decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>   In the result, the Rule is made absolute. The impugned judgment and order dated 27.4.2011 passed by the learned District Judge, Kurigram in Miscellaneous Appeal No.18 of 2010 allowing the appeal setting-aside the order No.27 dated 23.02.2010 passed by the learned Assistant Judge, Rajarhat, Kurigram in Miscellaneous (Violation) Case No.13 of 2008 is set-aside. The order No.27 dated 23.02.2010 passed by the learned Assistant Judge, Rajarhat, Kurigram in Miscellaneous (Violation) Case No.13 of 2008 is hereby restored. The order of stay granted earlier by this Court stands vacated.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>   However, the trial Court concerned is directed to proceed with the suit expeditiously.<br/> <br/>        Let a copy of this judgment be communicated to the Courts concerned at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> <br/> </div></div></div>

The entire episode appears, ex-facie, to be tainted with manipulation, distortion and falsity, although, the real and only beneficiary of the entire exercise is none other than the petitioner himself. The petitioner has prayed for a direction upon the respondents for implementation of the judgment passed by the Court of Settlement. Before endorsing the judgment in question, the Court should be satisfied that the said  judgment is based upon sound legal foundation. It appears that a serious fraud has been committed by way of manipulation of the official file, distortion of documents and last, but not least, by making misleading, false and incorrect statements before the Court of law.

The allottee built a house thereon and whilst being in possession of the same, entered into a contract on 01.06.1969 to sell the said property to the petitioner for a sum of Tk. 60,000/-. Upon payment of Tk. 50,000/- a written agreement was executed and possession was delivered to the petitioner on 01.06.1969. However, since the said Nazir Ahmed failed to execute and register the sale deed, the petitioner filed Title Suit No. 894 of 1985 on 02.07.1985 for specific performance of contract in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka and it was decreed on contest by judgment and decree dated 30.07.1987.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>     Against the aforesaid judgment and decree dated 30.07.1987, the Government preferred Title Appeal No. 309 of 1987 before the Additional District Judge, 4<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka and the same was dismissed on contest on 31.10.1990. Thereafter, the petitioner filed Execution Case No. 5 of 1988 and got the Deed of Sale executed and registered through Court, being Deed No. 1404 dated 18.05.1991.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>     In the meantime, the list of abandoned buildings was published in the Bangladesh Gazette Extra Ordinary dated 23.09.1986 which included the said building in the ‘Ka’ list. The petitioner filed Case No. 193 of 1996 before the Court of Settlement, Dhaka under section 7(1) of Ordinance 54 of 1985 for exclusion of the said property from the list of abandoned buildings. The Court of Settlement, vide judgment dated 25.05.2000, allowed the petitioner’s case and directed the Government to release the said building from the list of abandoned properties.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>     Earlier, during pendency of the case before the Court of Settlement, the petitioner filed an application on 20.06.1995 to the Assistant Commissioner Settlement, Housing and Public Works for effecting mutation of his name in place of Nazir Ahmed, the original lessee of the Government. Subsequently, after the passing of the judgment by the Court of Settlement, the petitioner filed a petition on 24.01.2001 for issuing a notification in the Gazette to exclude the said property from the list of abandoned buildings in terms of the said judgment. The petitioner filed applications to the Ministry of Housing and Public Works, Secretariat, Dhaka, briefly, ‘the Ministry’ on 25.06.2002 and 26.09.2002 with similar prayer. However, since the respondents failed to take steps in the matter, the petitioner was constrained to move this Court and file the instant writ petition praying for a direction upon the respondents to exclude the said house from the ‘Ka’ list of the abandoned buildings and to mutate the petitioner’s name in respect of the said house.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>     Mr. Mohammad Ozair Farooq, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner submits at the outset that the petitioner has been pursuing the matter for the last 20 years. He further submits that although the Court of Settlement, Dhaka allowed the petitioner’s case and directed the Government to exclude the said house from the ‘Ka’ list of abandoned buildings, yet, the Government neither complied with the aforesaid order nor did it file any writ petition challenging the said judgment of the Court of Settlement. Mr. Farooq contends that the action of the Government in not challenging the order of the Court of Settlement, Dhaka indicates that they have accepted the verdict, but unfortunately, they have not complied with the directive given in the said verdict. Mr. Farooq substantiates his  contention by referring to the Memo No. সল/মিস-৭০/২০০১ (রীট)-৪৬২১ dated 30.09.2001, evidenced by Annexure-X to the supplement affidavit, which reads as under :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/>“<strong>বিষয়ঃ-</strong> বাড়ী নং ২/২ ব্লক সি শাহজাহান রোড, মোহাম্মদপুর, ঢাকা বাড়ীর কোর্ট অব সেটেলমেন্ট মামলা নং ১৯৩/৯৬ এর রায়ের বিরুদ্ধে রীট মামলা দায়ের প্রসঙ্গে।<br/>উপরোক্ত বিষয়ে নির্দেশিত হইয়া জানাইতেছি যে, সেটেলমেন্ট আদালতের ২৫-৫-২০০০ ইং তারিখের প্রদত্ত রায়ের বিরুদ্ধে (সেটেলমেন্ট মামলা নং ১৯৩/৯৬) রীট মামলা দায়ের করিয়া ফললাভের সম্ভাবনা দেখা যাইতেছে না। ফলে রীট মামলা দায়ের না করিবার সিদ্ধান্ত গৃহীত হইয়াছে।<br/>একই সাথে পূর্ত মন্ত্রণালয়ের শাখা-১২/সি-২১৯/৮২(অংশ)- ১২/সি-৭০/৮৫(অংশ) এবং এ এল-১৭৩/৬১ নথি ০৩(তিন) টি ফেরত প্রদান করা হইল।</div><div style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: center;">(শাহীদুল ইসলাম আজামী)<br/>সিনিয়র সহকারী সচিব (রীট)”<br/><u>২৭.৯.২০০১</u></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>7.</strong>     Mr. Farooq lastly submits that the petitioner has been in possession and occupation of the house in question along with the members of his family since 1969 and the respondents have not been able to produce any evidence to the contrary in support of their claim that the said building was an abandoned building and hence, its inclusion in the ‘Ka’ list was without any basis and, therefore, illegal.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>     Although the respondents have not filed any affidavit-in- opposition, Mr. Razik Al-Jalil, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing in opposition to the Rule, submits that the finding of the Court of Settlement was not based on proper assessment and evaluation of the  evidence on record. The learned Deputy Attorney General submits that it has been decided by our Apex Court that the inclusion of a building in the list of abandoned properties carries with it the presumption that it has been listed in accordance with law. The Deputy Attorney General further contends that although the petitioner claimed to have been occupying and residing in the said property in 1969, yet he has not been able to produce any documents to establish his title over the said property. The Deputy Attorney General lastly submits that since the original allottee was found absent after the war of liberation, the building was listed in the ‘Ka’ list in accordance with law.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>     Upon conclusion of hearing, the matter was fixed for delivery of judgment on 08.02.2007. However, having gone through the materials before us, we found it necessary to call for the official file relating to the house in question from the Ministry and accordingly, the delivery of judgment was deferred until today. In the meantime, as per the Court’s order dated 15.02.07, the official file relating to the said house has been sent to the Court and we have perused the same. We have also permitted Mr. Ozair Farooq, the learned Advocate for the petitioner to peruse the file.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>   A detailed perusal of the “Note-sheet” and the connected files containing the official letters and other relevant documents and papers not only make a very dismal reading, but also reveal the entire episode in its true perspective. To begin with, many pages in the official file are missing.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>At page 4, serial no 10 of the note-sheet , it has been stated :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/>“১২-সি-২১৯/৮২ অংশ-১ নথি খানা ভারপ্রাপ্ত কর্মকর্তা আইন কোষ হইতে গ্রহণ করিয়া দেখিতে পাইলাম যে, উক্ত নথি খানায় ক্রমিক নং ১-১৫ পাতা নাই।<br/>উপরোক্ত বর্ননার অালোকে সহকারী সচিব ১২ এর নজরে রাখার জন্য পেশ করা হইল।”</div><div style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: center;"><strong>Signed (Illegible)<br/>17.11.87</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>11.</strong>   In the official file referred to in the note-sheet quoted above, a notice to show cause dated 3.7.85, a copy of the order of temporary injunction dated 8.7.85 passed by the Sub-Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Dhaka and the hand written copy of the written statement and the written Objection by the defendant nos. 2-4 in Title Suit No. 894/85 make up pages 1-15, although the first notice bears page mark ‘17’ which has been crossed out and renumbered as page ‘1’. Moreover, the typed copy of the very same written statement has been appended in the file at pages 16-19 and again at pages 30-33.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>   Although there is no explanation as to the circumstances or reason for the non availability of such papers in the official file, nevertheless, the continuity of the pages has been maintained by inserting photocopies of different documents (e.g. plaint of the title suit, written statement etc.) which, apparently, are irrelevant and out of place in that order of the file. To note a few instances :</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The Written Objection filed by defendant nos. 2-4 in Title Suit No. 894/85 appear twice, at page 20-24 and again at pages   26-30.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A photocopy of the certified copy of the decree passed in Title Suit No. 894/95 is appended in as many as 4 (four) different places in the file, namely, at pages 47-49, 63-65, 210-212 and 243-245.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The copy of an application for Injunction (10 pages) filed by the plaintiff in Title Suit No. 894/95 is to be found thrice; at the next page following page 74 (with no number) and continuing upto page 83, pages 126-136 and again at pages 137-147.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The plaint Title Suit No. 894/95 appears at the next page after page 150 (with no number) and ends at page 159 and the identical document appears again at pages 166-173.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>13.</strong>   In other words, for reasons best known to the concerned officials of the Ministry, the same document has been inserted in the file at different places, thereby replacing several pages in the original file.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>   In course of his submission, the learned Advocate for the petitioner has relied heavily upon Annexure-X of the supplementary affidavit and submitted with great force that although the Government had decided not to file any writ petition against the order of the Court of Settlement, they have not released the said building from the ‘Ka’ list, thereby causing harassment and agony to the petitioner for the past several years. A perusal of the official file indicates that it is far from that; in fact, it is otherwise. From the official noting, it appears that not only was a specific direction given by the then Secretary of the Ministry to challenge the order of the Court of Settlement by filing a writ petition, an order was also passed for enquiring into the reasons  for non-filing of the writ petition.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>At page 15, Serial No. 40 of the note sheet, it reads:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/>“৪০। রীট না করার কারন পরীক্ষা করে পেশ করুন।”</div><div style="margin-left: 160px;">Sd</div><div style="margin-left: 160px;">১৫/১০/২০০০</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>15.</strong>   At page 19, Serial No. 46 of the note sheet, on 17.07.2001,  the Secretary of the Ministry himself wrote as follows :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“৪৬। রীট দায়েরের ব্যবস্থা নিন।”<br/>Serial No. 48 of the note sheet at page 19 reads :<br/>“৪৮। নির্দেশিত হইয়া রীট দায়েরের প্রস্তাব পেশ করিতেছি”</div><div style="margin-left: 120px;">         Sd (Illegible)<br/>১৬.৮.০০             ৬/৮</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>16.</strong>   Despite such clear and categorical directives, no writ petition was filed on behalf of the Government. On the contrary, efforts appear to have made for release of the said property from the ‘Ka’ list which is manifested by the issuance of Annexure-X to the supplementary affidavit. We are quite baffled, to say the least, as to how the same could have been issued. We have also noticed, albeit with some astonishment, that although the Memo contained in Annexure X is dated 30.9.2001, it was signed by the concerned  Senior Assistant Secretary (Writ) on 27.9.2001, ie,  3 days earlier.<br/> <br/><strong>17.   </strong>It is quite apparent that some of the officials of the Ministry acted in utmost haste and eagerness to have the property released from the ‘Ka’ list. After a series of notings and opinions, the file was placed before the then Minister, Ministry of Housing and Public Works for necessary approval, who, instead of according approval, passed the following order on 24.04.2002, which is evident from serial no. 59 of the note sheet at page 23 : </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“৫৯। বিশেষজ্ঞ উকিলের মতামত গ্রহণপূর্বক রীট দায়েরের ব্যবস্থা নিন।”</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;">Sd (Illegible)<br/>২৮/৪/২০০২</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>18.   </strong>Thereafter, there was no further development in the matter.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>   It further transpires from the official file that an affidavit-in-opposition was prepared on behalf of the Ministry in the instant writ petition which was duly signed by the Law Officer, Ministry of Housing and Public Works, Bangladesh Secretariat, Dhaka on 6.7.04. However, we also find, much to our dismay, that it was neither affirmed nor filed in Court. On our query, the learned Deputy Attorney General informs the Court that he has no knowledge about the same.<br/> <br/><strong>20.   </strong>Although it has been stated an oath in paragraph no. 1 of the writ petition that “the petitioner has been living in the house with the members of his family since 1.6.69”, it transpires from the official file that such statement is not only misleading, but factually incorrect too. The house in question was allotted not once, but twice since independence in 1971 by the respondent no.1, being in possession and control of the same. It was first allotted to one A. Wahed Khan, a Secretary to the Government, who, at the relevant time, was serving as OSD in the Ministry of Agriculture. Thereafter, the Government, by Memo No. S-IX/D-219/82/117 dated 22.01.1984, at page 23 of the file (second part), allotted the said house to the National Games for Disabled Association (NGDA) and the subject-matter of the allotment letter reads as under :<br/>“পরিত্যক্ত বাড়ী নং 2/2, Shajahan Road, Mohammadpur, (On Rental Basis at the rate of Tk. 4,258.00 P.M.), মোহাম্মদপুর, ঢাকা এর বরাদ্দ পত্র।”<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>   However, the aforesaid allottee could not take possession of the house as it was being occupied by ‘unauthorised persons’ and requested the then Minister, Ministry of Housing and Public Works to take action in this regard. A G.D. was made with Mohammadpur Police Station, which is evident from page 41 of the file, which contains a letter bearing No. NGDA/209/85 dated 06.11.1985 addressed to the Joint Sectary, Ministry of Works, A.P. Wing, Bangladesh Secretariat, Dhaka from Lt. Colonel Khan Golap, Chairman of National Games for Disabled  Association, wherein it was stated :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“1. A.P. House No. 2/2, Shahjahan Road, Mohammadpur, Dhaka-7 has been allotted to National Games for Disabled Association vide Ministry of Works memo No. S-IX/D-219/82/117 dated 22<sup>nd</sup> January, 1984 (copy attached). The possession of the house was not handed over by the Superintending Engineer, A.P. Circle as the house was in possession of Mr. A. Wahed Khan, an Officer on Special Duty of Ministry of Agriculture. On our repeated request to the Ministry of Works as well as the concerned Superintending Engineer of A.P. Circle to take necessary action or handing over the possession of the house to National Games for Disabled Association as soon as possible, Executive Engineer and Superintending Engineer of A.P. Circle requested Ministry of Works vide their letter No. 3988 dated 6<sup>th</sup> August, 1985 and letter No. M.C/4739 dated 7<sup>th</sup> October, 1985 respectively to take necessary action in this respect.<br/><br/>2.

Ayub Ali v Bangladesh, reported in 47 DLR AD 71 in the following terms :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“...................................................<br/>...................................................<br/>The decree in the suit for specific performance of contract will show that it has only decided the controversy between the vendor and the vendee and directed the vendor to execute the necessary document in favour of the vendee. I have, therefore, no hesitation to hold that such a decree is not the one which is mentioned in Proviso (a) and, as such, the existence of such a decree cannot be pleaded as a bar for inclusion of the building in the list.”<br/>(Per A.T.M. Afzal, J, as his Lordship then was)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>28.</strong>   We are quite conscious of the fact that the judgment of the Court of Settlement is not under challenge before us. At the same time, it is apparent from the notings and documents in the official file that for reasons best known to some concerned officials, the said judgment of the Court of Settlement was allowed to remain unchallenged despite directives from the top two officials of the Ministry of Works, namely the then Hon’ble Minister and the then Secretary, to file a writ petition against the aforesaid judgment.<br/> <br/><strong>29.</strong>   The entire episode appears, ex-facie, to be tainted with manipulation, distortion and falsity.  The conduct of certain officials in the Ministry raises considerable doubt in our minds as to the bonafide of both their intention and actions, although, the real and only beneficiary of the entire exercise is none other than the petitioner himself.<br/> <br/><strong>30.</strong>   In R. v. Kensington Income Tax Commrs., (1917) 1 KB 486, Viscount Reading, CJ, observed :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“Where an ex parte application has been made to this Court for a rule nisi or other process, if the Court comes to the conclusion that the affidavit in support of the application was not candid and did not fairly state the facts, but stated them in such a way as to mislead the Court as to the true facts, the Court ought, for its own protection and to prevent an abuse of its process, to refuse to proceed any further with the examination of the merits. This is power inherent in the Court, but one which should only be used in cases which bring conviction to the mind of the Court that it has been deceived.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>31.</strong>   Exactly half a century later, a similar view was expressed in the case of Barium Chemicals Ltd. v. Company Law Board, reported in AIR 1967 SC 295, where it was held :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“though an order passed in the exercise of powers under a statute cannot be challenged on the ground of propriety or sufficiency, it is liable to be quashed on the ground of mala fides, dishonesty or corrupt purpose”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>32.</strong>   In the instant case, the petitioner has prayed for a direction from this Court upon the respondents for implementation of the judgment passed by the Court of Settlement. However, while doing so, the Court should not pass such a directive by merely endorsing the judgment in question, but ought to be satisfied that the judgment sought to be implemented is based upon sound legal foundation, i.e, supported by legal documents and materials on record. If it is not so, this Court, in exercise of its equitable jurisdiction, should refrain from passing such a directive. To do otherwise would, in our view, be “inequitable”.<br/> <br/><strong>33.</strong>   Our aforesaid view finds support and endorsement in the decision of Municipal Board, Pratabgarh V. Mahendra Singh Chawla and others, reported in AIR 1982 Supreme Court 1493 where their Lordships held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“While administering law it is to tempered with equity and if the equitable situation demands after setting right the legal formulations not to take it to the logical end, this Court would be failing in its duty if it does not notice equitable considerations and mould the final order in exercise of its extraordinary jurisd-iction. Any other approach, would render this Court a normal Court of appeal which it is not.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>34.</strong>   In the instant case, the judgment passed by the Court of Settlement is not supported by the documents in the official file; rather, the glaring inconsistencies and contradictions run contrary to the petitioner’s case.  This is somewhat akin to a very recent development in the English Jurisdiction which has been termed by the English Courts as a ‘material error of fact’ doctrine. According to Professor Peter Leyland and Gordon Anthony :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“This doctrine goes for beyond issues of jurisdictional fact to allow challenges to decisions on a point of law where it can be shown that an error of fact has given rise to unfairness.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;">(Textbook on Administrative Law, 5<sup>th</sup> Edition, 2005, at page 314).<br/> <br/><strong>35.</strong>   In  Niranjan Prasad v. State, reported in AIR 1960 All 323, the Court held :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“A finding of fact can be quashed if the Court holds that it could not reasonably have been founded on the materials before the enquiry Tribunal.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>36.</strong>   To quote the distinguished English jurist Professor H.W.R. Wade :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“An order or determination will not be conclusive if it has    been obtained by fraud or misrepresentation.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;">(Administrative Law, Fifth Edition, page 228)<br/> <br/><strong>37.</strong>   We are reminded of the pronouncement by no less an authority than Lord Denning, MR himself in Lazarus Estates Ltd. v. Beasley, reported in (1956) 1 Q.B. 702, where his Lordship stated so aptly :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“No judgment of a Court, no order of a Minister, can be allowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud. Fraud unravels everything”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>38.</strong>   In view of the foregoing discussion and having regard to the documents which have come to our notice from the official file relating to the house in question, we are of the view that a serious fraud has been committed by way of manipulation of the official file, distortion of documents and last, but not least, by making misleading, false and incorrect statements before the Court of law. In such premises, the Rule is liable to be discharged.<br/> <br/><strong>39.</strong>   Accordingly, the Rule is discharged.<br/> <br/><strong>40.</strong>   Although we were inclined to award cost against the petitioner, we refrain from doing so.  However, the respondents are at liberty to realize the rent of the said house in question from the petitioner for his unauthorised use and occupation of the same since 1986 till date.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Send a copy of the judgment to respondent No. 2 for information.<br/><br/><strong>ED.</strong></div></div></div>
