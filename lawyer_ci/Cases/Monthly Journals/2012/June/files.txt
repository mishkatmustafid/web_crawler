Nuruzzaman, J:</u></strong><br/> <br/><strong>1.</strong>         The instant Rule has been obtained by the petitioner calling upon the opposite parties to show cause as to why the impugned judgment and decree complained of in the petition moved in Court should not be set aside.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong>         The material facts relevant for disposal of the Rule, in short, is that the petitioner as plaintiff  instituted Title Suit No. 242/1978 for declaration that the Deed No. 10292 dated 15.11.1975 shown to have been executed by the plaintiff in favour of the defendant Nos. 1-7 is a forged, fraudulent, without consideration and not binding upon the plaintiff. By amendment order dated 24.3.1981 the plaintiff also prayed for declaration and confirmation of possession, if it is proved that the plaintiff is not in possession then prayed for khas possession in the suit land. The plaint case, is that, the suit land originally belonged to Ballok Mondal. After the death of Ballok Mondal his 8 sons inherited the same. The youngest son Arjun died during the period of liberation while he was going to India. The plaintiff is the wife of Arjun and after his death she became the heir of late Arjun. The rest 7 sons of Ballok Mondal are the defendant Nos. 1-7. The plaintiff has ejmali possession in the suit land with the defendants. In the month of December, 1977 the plaintiff came to learn that the defendant Nos. 1-7 has created a deed of Kabala for the suit land. The plaintiff having been heard about the so called deed she searched for and could know that the defendants had made a deed of Kabala in Shoilkupa Sub-Registry Office, on 15th November, 1975. The plaintiff never executed such deed of Kabala in favour of anybody. The plaintiff neither took Tk. 4,000/- from anybody nor executed  any deed of Kabala. The plaintiff claims that the Kabala shown to have been executed by her obviously forged, fraudulent and without consideration. The plaintiff’s further believes that the defendants’ had created the deed of Kabala only to deprive the plaintiff from the suit land with malafide intention  by making false personification, hence, the plaintiff compelled to file the instant suit.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>         All the defendants contested the suit by filing written statements denying the material allegations made in the plaint, stating, inter alia, that the suit is not maintainable in it’s present form. The suit is bad for suppression of facts. It is admitted that the plaintiff’s husband Arjurn is the youngest son of Ballok Mondal and the suit land originally belonged to Ballok Mondal. Arjun died in the year 1979, one year before the death of his father Ballok Mondal. It is not the fact that Arjun died during liberation period while he was going to India. The wife of Arjun had been living with the defendants after the death of her husband. One day Suren and Judisthir, the brothers of the plaintiff came to the plaintiff and told that the plaintiff would transfer her share of property by Kabala. The defendants being afraid by the proposal of the transferring of the property by the plaintiff, the defendants agreed to purchase the same and consideration money was fixed Tk. 4,000/- only. The plaintiff took the consideration money from the father’s of the defendants and went to the Shoilkupa S/R Office and executed the deed of Kabala in favour of the defendants and since then the defendants have been possessing the suit property. The defendants’ father handed over the original deed to the Tahsilder and as such, the original deed in question was not in their possession. The Tahsilder did not return the original deed. The plaintiffs’ suit is nothing but harassing one and the same is liable to be dismissed with cost.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>         At the trial the plaintiff’s side adduced 2 (two) P. Ws. And the defendants adduced 2 (two) D. Ws. After conclusion of the trial the trial Court considering the materials available on record decreed the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>         Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and decree of the trial Court the defendants preferred appeal before the learned District Judge, Magura. Eventually the learned District Judge transferred the Title Appeal to the Court of the learned Subordinate Judge, Magura for hearing and disposal. On appeal the learned Subordinate Judge, Magura considering the facts and circumstances and evidence on record allowed the appeal reversing the judgment and decree of the trial Court on the grounds that the plaintiff is not in possession of the suit land and the learned Munsif was wrong in deciding that it was the duty of the defendants to pray for sending the left thumb-impression for examination of the expert opinion. So, according to the appellate Court it was a wrong finding, hence, the trial Court apparently did mistake in both in facts and law. On the above two grounds the appellate Court allowed the appeal by reversing the judgment and decree of the trial Court and dismissed the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>         The points for determination is whether the appellate Court in reversing the judgment of the trial Court committed any error of law resulted in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>         Mr. Bivash Chandra Biswas, with Mr. Hossain Md. Borhan, the learned Advocates appe-aring for the petitioner submits that the trial Court after appreciating the evidence on record opined that the plaintiff on 17.01.1979 on an application sought for a direction upon the defendants to file the original deed being deed No. 10292 dated 15.11.1975 in the Court which was allowed. The defendants time and again took the plea to submit the original documents but could not file the same and later, on an application stated that the original deed was given to the Tahsilder of Isakhada for mutation and that was not returned to them by the Tahsilder. Then the court below called for a report asking the Tahsilder of Isakhada to submit a report whether the alleged deed was submitted by the defendants in the office of the Tahsidler is original or not. The Tahsilder of Isakhada submitted his report vide Memo No. 90 dated 9.8.1979, Ext. 3, to the Court stating that the alleged original deed of Kabala had never been filed in his office for mutation. On the facts and circumstances of the case on the applications of the plaintiff the trial Court called the LTI Register from the S/R office of Shoilkupa. On receipt of the LTI Register the learned Judge himself compared the LTI of LTI Register in serial No. 14297 with the LTI of Bela Rani which has been given in the deposition-sheet. On comparison of the two L.T.Is., the trial Court noticed that there is a clear distinction in between the LTI put in the Register being Serial No. 14297 and the LTI of deposition-sheet. Then the trial court opined that the LTI of Bela Rani in the deposition-sheet and the LTI in the LIT Register had no similarity. He further pointed out that the defendants’ side on the conclusion and for decision of the trial Court might send it for the expert opinion as burden of prove lies with them under section 103 of the Evidence Act. However, the defendants did not take any steps for expert opinion. He further opined that P.W. 2 Monoranjan in his deposition stated that he read over the disputed deed of Kabala to Bela Rani. However, at the time of cross examination the deed Ext. C was handed over to him to read but he could not read the same. Further-more, in cross-examination he admitted that he cannot say the name of the scribe who took the LTI of Bela Rani. But from the exhibit it is seen that it was written by Monoranjan. Therefore, the trial Court on the above findings came to a clear decision that the deed in question is a forged one, and as such, decreed the suit. We find from the judgment and decree dated 28.2.1984 that appellate court without adverting the above evidence on record only basing mere   surmise   and   conjecture reversed   the   trial   Court’s   findings   though   according   to me the trial Court   rightly   decided   one   point,   i.e.,   taking   the  expert opinion   lies   upon   the   defendants.   More-so, the Court was not bound to refer a document to the hand-writing expert when the Court itself noted the dissimilarity in LTI as defendant failed to produce the original document in court. So, I am of the view that the appellate Court itself committed error on a misconception of law that the expert opinion is necessary to resolve the dispute regarding LTI wherein the defendants admittedly failed to produce the original deed in question.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>         Besides these, it appears to me that the judgment of the appellate Court is also tainted as the evidence and findings of the Trial Court as available on record were not adverted by the appellate court but set aside the same merely on a technical grounds that the plaintiff has failed to take the expert opinion. The learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner referring the ground No. 1 of the revisional application and the deposition of P.W.1 submits that P.W.1 categor-ically stated that she is in possession jointly with other co-sharers but the appellate Court without considering the above deposition of P.W. 1 quoting some statements from the plaint opined that the plaintiff is not in possession of the suit land. P.W.1 on oath stated that she is in possession and defence upon cross-examination did not found anything in their favour. Mere referring some statements in the plaint which obviously neither admitted nor evidence on record and thus, cannot to be a ground to reverse the evidence given on oath. Therefore, I am of the view that the appellate Court also in that point of view committed mistake. Therefore the judgment and decree passed by the appellate Court by reversing the trial court Judgment and decree is not a proper Judgment of reversal.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>         On the facts and circumstances of the case, it appears that the plaintiff is a widow, she only enjoy the suit land in her lifetime after her demise, the suit land if not disposed of otherwise the same must be devolved upon the heirs of the late Arjun. So there is no cogent ground to disbelieve the plaint case that the defendant only to depriving the plaintiff’s lifetime interest has created a forged document.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>       In the facts and circumstances of the case my firm view is that the court of appeal below without appreciating the evidence on record mere surmises and conjectures set aside the trial court’s judgment which resulted in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>       For the reasons and discussions made herein above, I am of the view that the judgment and decree passed by the appellate Court is tainted from legal infirmity, therefore, calls for interference by this Court for ends of justice.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>       Thus, the Rule having merit, it succeeds.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>       In the result, the Rule is made absolute without any order as to cost.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>       The judgment and decree passed by the appellate Court in title appeal No. 104 of 1981 is hereby set aside and those Judgment and decree dated 26.05.1981 of the trial Court is hereby affirmed. The office is directed to send down the L.C Record and Communicate this   judgment at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

The said decision has been given without giving opportunity to BGP (Bangladesh) International to represent their part of the case. No doubt, there is serious anomally over the ambiguity of the petitioner-company who filed RFP, which is still lying pending before the Evaluation Committee for consideration and above all as per ITC clause 5.1 filing RFP is limited to short list contractors only. As such, since BGP (Bangladesh) International has been declared non-responsive the said short-listed contractor is the appropriate aggrieved person to maintain this writ petition, not BGP Inc., CNPC. The respondent No. 8 being a “sub-contractor” it’s right and interest lies with the short-listed contactor CGG veritas, France who does not appear to have authorized the said respondent to file complaint to the concern authority against BGP Inc., CNPC in order to oust BGP (Bangladesh) International without making it a party. Hence, has no <em>locus standi </em>to maintain the complaint before the Review Panel-1, respondent No.3. In the present case, the Procuring Entity short listed 8 (eight) contractors and the RFP submitted by them are still lying pending for consideration before the Evaluation Committee, either to be declared responsive or non-responsive. Moreover, the allegation was against BGP (Bangladesh) International whose right to be declared responsive or non-responsive has been adjudicated and disposed of by the respondent no. 3 without making it a party and without issuing notice providing opportunity  to defend it’s part of the case by adducing documents, which is a flagrant violation of the principle of natural justice. </strong><strong>The impugned order dated 10.02.2011 passed by the respondent no.3 is declared to have been passed without lawful authority and hence, of no legal effect. . . . .

IMED/CPIU/RP-01/90-2011/151 dated 10.02.2011 (Annexure-A), purporting that the petitioner, amongst others, is non-responsive against “Invitation for Engagement of Seismic Contractor” for conduct of 3100 L Km of 2D seismic survey in Block nos.2,3,4,6,8 and 11 under proposal no.31.02.204/160 issued on 11.04.2010, should not be declared to have been passed without lawful authority and hence, of no legal effect.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong>     At the time of issuance of the Rule the operation of the impugned decision dated 10.02.2011 has been stayed.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>     Facts, in brief, are that the petitioner, a globally reputed geophysical and seismic survey company incorporated under the laws of the People’s Republic of China, having its Head Office in China and Branch Office in Bangladesh, impugned the decision of the respondent no.3 communicated under memo No. IMED/CPTU/RP-01/90-2011/151 dated 10.02.11 (Annexure-A) contending, <em>inter alia,</em> that it had undertaken seismic survey projects in various parts of the world, including Bangladesh, for different public and private sector clients. The petitioner company established a branch office in Dhaka upon obtaining permission from the Board of Investment vide memo dated 25.11.2009 (Annexure-B). Vide notification dated 17.09.2009, Petrobangla, respon-dent No. 5 requested to offer Expressions of Interest (in short, EOI) for short listing seismic contractor to carry out 2D Land Seismic Contract-3100 Lkm Seismic Survey including Data Processing and Interpretation under Fast Track Programme. In response to the said invitation the petitioner submi-tted an EOI on 28.10.2009 containing necessary informations and particulars about the petitioner-company, signed by the General Manager, BGP (Bangladesh) International. It has also been contended that EOI, in fact, was submitted by the petitioner-Company, “BGP Inc., China National Petroleum Corporation (in short, CNPC)” as is apparent from the contents of the EOI and the materials enclosed therein including the performance certificates issued against past contracts(Annexure-D). Following the assessment of the respective EOIs submitted by the interested parties, the petitioner along with 7 (seven) other contractors were short listed as contractors for the proposed survey by Petrobangla, placing the petitioner company at serial No. 6 under the name “BGP (Bangladesh) International”. Accordingly, letter of invitation dated 11.04.2010 was issued enclosing therewith a “Request for Proposal (in short, RFP) inviting the petitioner company to submit its proposal for the respective project (Annexure-E). Since “BGP (Bangladesh) International” was not a separate legal entity, but part of the internal organizational structure of the petitioner-Company the petitioner, before submitting its technical proposal(RFP) and before the respondent No. 8 filed objection, under it’s cover letter dated 10.06.2010 along with a letter dated 24.05.2010 and a statement dated 31.05.2010, clarified the position that the name of the short listed bidding entity was, in fact, BGP Inc., China National Petroleum Corporation (Annexure-F, F-1, and F-2 respectively). When RFPs, submitted by the petitioner-company and others, were still under the process of consideration the petitioner-company came to receive information of the impugned decision purporting that it had been declared non-responsive by the respondent no.3 vide it’s decision dated 10.02.2011 (Annexure-A) without making either BGP (Bangladesh) International or BGP Inc., China National Petroleum Corporation a party or giving personal hearing, upon a review petition filed by the respondent no.8 purporting to be the sub-contractor of one of the other short listed contractors, CGG Veritas, France without due authorization of the Principal-Contractor (Annexure-G,G-1 and G-2 respectively). Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the petitioner company had preferred the instant application and obtained the present Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>     Respondent No.8 entered appearance by filling affidavit-in-opposition contending, <em>inter alia,</em> that Petrobangla vide notification dated 17.09.2009 invited for EOI from the eligible contractors in order to get seismic contract for carrying out 2-D land seismic survey involving about 3100 Lkm data acquisition including Data Processing and Interpretation and related services. CGG Veritas, France on 28.10.2009 submitted EOI along with other participants including BGP (Bangladesh) International (Annexure-I-A and I-B). After scrutiny, on 11.04.2010 Petrobangla made a short list as per the Rules and sent a Letter of Invitation to 8(eight) short listed companies. Accordingly, Request For Proposal (shortly, “RFP”) was issued to the short listed contractors including BGP (Bangladesh) International. The petitioner-company namely BGP Inc., CNPC was not on that list. CGG Veritas, France mentioning respondent no.8 as its local agent and sub-contractor submitted RFP to Petrobangla on 14.06.2010 (Annexure-I-C, I-D and I-E respectively). BGP (Bangladesh) International submitted EOI in its own name and was short listed to participate in the bid, but RFP was submitted on 14.06.2010 in the name of BGP Inc., China National Petroleum Corporation, No. 189 Fanyang Xi Road, Hebei Province, China instead of BGP (Bangladesh) International in violation of the terms and conditions of RFP Clause-5.1. Respondent no.8, the local agent of CGG Veritas, France on 26.12.2010 submitted an application to the Director (Planning), Petrobangla complaining the irregularity that a new Company BGP Inc., CNPC though not short listed, was incorporated in the evaluation list in violation of  section 117 of the Public Procurement Rules, 2008 (in short “PPR, 2008”) Annexure-I-F). Finding no response respondent no.8 on 03.01.2010 filed another representation to the Head of Procuring Entity and the Managing Director of BAPEX about the aforementioned complaint who also failed to take necessary steps in the matter (Annexure-G). Respondent No. 8 on 11.01.2011 raised the said issue to the Secretary, Energy, Mineral Resources Division, Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources, but without any effective result (Annexure-I-H). Having exhausted all the procedural steps as per rule 57 of PPR, 2008 and having not received any response respondent no.8 on 19.01.2011 filed a review petition to the Chairman, Review Panel-1, CPTU, IMED Division, Ministry of Planning, respondent No. 3. The Review Panel after hearing both the parties (respondent No. 8 and Petrobangla) vide memo No. IMED/CPTU/RP-01/ 90-2011/151 dated 10.02.2011 allowed the same and declared BGP (Bangladesh) International non-responsive according to PPR, 2008. Being aggrieved the petitioner had filed the aforesaid writ petition even though it neither participated in the tender process nor was in the short list and accordingly, the present writ petition is not maintainable. It has further been contended that BGP (Bangladesh) International at no stage of the tender process claimed that they had Branch Office in Dhaka, Bangladesh or was the agent of BGP Inc., China National Petroleum Corporation. Also, the organogram so had been presented by the writ petitioner goes to show that there is no link between BGP (Bangladesh) International and BGP Inc., CNPC. As such, the petitioner-company was not entitled to be informed or communicated about the decision whatsoever of the respondent No. It has further been stated that on 25.11.2009 BGP (Bangladesh) International had established a Branch office at Dhaka of BGP Inc., CNPC on 25.11.2009 which is much later than the notification dated 17.09.2009 published by Petrobangla and also after the closing date of EOI on 28.10.2009. As such, opening of a new branch cannot go to have retrospective effect. It has also been contended that BGP Inc., CNPC at no stage submitted any EOI in response to the notification dated 17.09.2009. The EOI was, in fact, submitted by the BGP (Bangladesh) International without any signature and address stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that it was submitted by BGP (Pakistan) International and that “BGP(Pakistan) International was responsible to receive and prepare the tender/bid package and make necessary arrangement to carry out the work”, which goes to prove that the BGP (Pakistan) International was separate entity as well as EOI being unsigned proved itself to be a fraudulent attempt with a view to sabotage or frustrate the project so had been undertaken by the respondent-government towards resolving the gas problem in the country. From Annexure-E it is clear that BGP (Bangladesh) International along with 7(seven) other companies were short listed, not the petitioner-company. Hence, question of submitting RFP by the petitioner does not arise at all. It has also been stated that letters dated 10.06.2010, 24,05.2010 and 31.05.2010 (Annexure-F, F-1 and F-2 respectively) submitted by the petitioner-company who appeared out of no where after one BGP (Bangladesh) International was short listed is an attempt to take over the opportunity given to BGP (Bangladesh) International, which is strictly prohibited under PPR Rules,2008 and is also in violation of the Letter of Invitation dated 11.04.2010. It has further been contended that the petitioner was not notified by serving copy of the review petition simply because they were not party to the dispute raised by the respondent no.8 before the respondent No. 3. It has also been stated that BGP (Bangladesh) International submitted its EOI under the name and style “BGP (Bangladesh) International”, Gulshan Dhaka but RFP was submitted by BGP Inc. CNPC No. 189 Fanyang Xi Road, Hebei Province, China. In the process of EOI no documents were filed in favour of the petitioner-company to show that both the companies were jointly ventured or linked with each other, rather from the documents of EOI (Annexure-D) it is quite clear that the BGP (Pakistan) International had authorized BGP (Bangladesh) International to submit EOI and said BGP (Pakistan) International was entitled to receive and prepare the tender/bid package and to make necessary arrangem-ent to carry out the work. The respondent No. 3 considering the same also found that BGP (Bangladesh) International had failed to show any link with BGP Inc. CNPC. It has further been contended that respondent No. 8 was the local agent of the short listed CGG Veritas as is evident from the papers submitted by the CGG Veritas to Petrobangla. In the technical offer of the bid respondent no.8 had been mentioned as agent and sub-contractor. It’s qualifications and experience were also incorporated in the offer. In the financial offer form 5B1 represented the name and address of the agent, the respondent no.8 and the same had been accepted by Petrobangla, hence the steps so had been taken by respondent no.8 was on behalf of CGG Veritas.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>     Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud, the learned Senior Advocate appearing with Mr. Mustafizur Rahman Khan the learned Advocate for the petitioner drawing attention to the notification dated 17.09.2009 (Annexure-C) submits that Petrobangla in its international tender had invited Expression of Interest(EOI) from the eligible contractors to be short listed to get Seismic Contract for carrying out 2D land seismic survey, where within it’s four corners there was no stipulation to the effect that the intended contractor has to have  a registered branch office in Bangladesh in order to offer EOI. He further goes to argue that in response to the offer made by the petitioner company on 17.09.2009 it had submitted EOI on 28.10.2009 along with the documents showing its experience /expertise in the respective field. In this connection drawing attention to Annexure-D to the writ petition he further contends that at the left hand corner of the cover page there is a logo of BGP Inc. CNPC. Moreso, the documents relating to experience and capacity of the Seismic data process Interpretation of service as enclosed with the EOI is of BGP Inc. CNPC. With the EOI the petitioner company also submitted the Articles of Association of BGP Inc. CNPC. Accordingly, he submits that since EOI is not confined within its cover page but represents the entire documents as submitted before the Petrobangla, as such it cannot be found that the BGP (Bangladesh) International and BGP Inc. CNPC are separate entity. Moreover, he submits that the petitioner company has submitted EOI as the bidder and that accepting the alleged anomally, as apparent on the cover page of EOI, Petrobangla has short listed the petitioner company along with 7(seven) others vide Invitation no. 31.02.04/162 dated 11.04.2010 (Annexure-E) and directed the short listed contractors to submit RFP. He also submits that the petitioner company vide letter dated 24.05.2010 clarified the ambiguity regarding submission of EOI by BGP (Bangladesh) International along with other statements (Annexure-F). Subsequent thereto the petitioner under its cover letter dated 10.06.2010(Annexure-F) submitted RFP to the BAPEX. When the process of selecting a qualified contractor is pending before the Evaluation Committee of Petrobangla, the respondent no.8 having no <em>locus standi</em> within the meaning of section 2(23) of the Public Procurement Act,2006 (Act no.24 of 2006)( in short, the Act) and rule 2(41) of Public Procurement Rules,2008(in short, the Rules) made an application on 26.12.2010 before the Director (Planning) Petrobangla, to the Secretary, Energy Mineral Resources Division, Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources on 11.01.2011, and the Head of Procuring Entity and Managing Director of BAPEX on 03.01.2011 (Annexure-G, G-1 and 2 respectively). In this regard drawing attention to the words “অভিযোগ করিবার অধিকার” as incorporated in section 29 of the Act no.24  of 2006 he submits that only the person as defined in section 2(23) and/or rule 2(41) is eligible to file complaint against the “Procuring Entity” (এয়কারী) for having sustained loss because of its failure to discharge its duties towards the complainant or when there is a possibility of sustaining loss for such failure; whereas “এয়কারী”, the procuring entity means the entity having the administrative and financial authority to purchase “ কোন পন্য এুয়কার্য বা সেবা”. Respondent no.8 being evidently a “sub-contractor” of CGG Veritas, France has no <em>locus standi</em> to make complaint before the Petrobangla/Bapex or even before the Review Panel since it’s right and interest are confined only within the periphery of the contract so have been entered into with CGG. Veritas, France. In addition to that a complaint may be made under rule 56 of the Rules, 2008 for the reasons as stated therein. In this regard upon placing the complaint so had been made by the respondent no.8. Mr. Mahmud further submits that it is apparent therefrom that it does not qualify any of the circumstances as mentioned in rule 56 of the Rules, 2008. Moreover, rule 56 does not permit to make complaint against one of the short listed contractors whose REP is yet to be scrutinized and finally selected by the Evaluation Committee of Petrobangla.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>     He also goes to argue that  the jurisdiction to declare a short listed contractor responsive or non-responsive squarely lies upon the Tender Evaluation Committee, the respondent no. 3 is authorized only to recommend (“সুপারিশএমে”),  not to declare short listed contractor non-responsive. As such, he submits that declaring BGP (Bangladesh) International, which is the integral part of the petitioner company, non-responsive vide impugned order is without jurisdiction. Lastly, he submits that the impugned order further fails for non-compliance of the principle of natural justice since neither BGP (Bangladesh) International nor BGP Inc. CNPC has been made party in the process nor they have been called upon to represent their part of the case. In this regard he submits that if the respective correspondences/documents as contained in Annexure-D as well as Annexure-F to the writ petition could have been produced before the Review Panel it might have taken a different view in view of the findings given by respondent no. 3 “no papers and relevant documents have been filed”. Accordingly, he submits that upon making the Rule absolute the impugned order dated 10.02.2011 (Annexure A to the writ petition) passed by the respondent no. 3 is liable to be declared to have made without lawful authority and is of no legal effect.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>     Per contra, Mr. M. Amir-Ul Islam the learned Senior Advocate appearing with Mr. Md. Nurul Amin, the learned Advocate on behalf of the respondent no.8 assailing the <em>locus standi</em> of the petitioner-company submits that EOI has not been placed by the petitioner company, it was BGP (Bangladesh) International who submitted the same via BGP (Pakistan) International without endorsing the signature of the respective officer of the company as well as without mentioning the date and address of the respective company. As such, the EOI so submitted the respective company has no legal basis. Moreover, when the Letter of Invitation clearly states, “it is not permissible to transfer this invitation to any other contractor/firm”, also in ITC: 5.1 it has been provided that “this request for proposal document is limited to short listed Contractor (s) only”, as such, submitting REP by BGP Inc. CNPC on 14.06.2010 is the violation of the terms and conditions of REP clause 5.1. He further argues that the respondent no.8 is an agent of CGG Veritas, France as has been clearly stated in its Technical Proposal Submission Form dated 05.06.2010 submitted by the CGG Varitas, France in addition to his status as a sub-contractor. In this regard he also submits that section 29 of the Act 24 of 2006 having used the words “ কান ব্যওিু ” he has <em>locus standi</em> to maintain a complaint against the petitioner-company who is nothing but an intruder to the tender process. Hence, submitting application on 26.12.2010 (Annexure-G) by the respondent No. 8, (the local agent of CGG veritas, France  and a sub-contractor) to respondent No. 6 bringing notice to the said irregularity being allegedly committed by an inter polar, the petitioner company, in violation of rule 117 of the Rules, 2008 is obviously maintainable. However, receiving no response the respondent no.8 made complaint to respondent no.7 as well as respondent no.2 to take necessary action. The authority paid no heed to the same. In this connection drawing attention to the EOI (Annexure-D) submitted by BGP (Bangladesh) International he goes to argue that on a plain reading it is apparent that Petorbangla is rather solicitating participation of the said company in the tender process with a view to hand over the bid to the said company most unauthorisedly and thereby making an attempt to frustrate the principle of transparency, which is one of the objects for which Act, 24 of 2006 has been promulgated. Accordingly, he submits that the petitioner company having not participated in the bid (which has further been fortified from Annexure-B), establishing a branch office in Dhaka upon obtaining permission from the Board of Investment on 25.11.2009 (after the closing date of the bid dated 28.09.2010) and that being a separate entity from BGP (Bangladesh) International  has no legal authority to submit REP. Considering the position of law and fact the Review Panel no.1, respondent no.3 has rightly declared BGP (Bangladesh) International  as non-responsive. Accordingly, he submits that no interference is called for, rather declaring that the petitioner is not an aggrieved person within the meaning of Article 102 of the Constitution this Rule is liable to be discharged as being not maintainable with costs.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>     Mr. Mohammad Ashraf Uddin Bhuiyan, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent No. 6, Petrobangla upon submitting a vokalatnama today adopted the submissions so has been advanced on behalf of the respondent no.8 and contended that till date no decision has been taken by the said respondent towards selecting the responsive contractor upon considering the REP as submitted by the short listed contractors.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>     In order to carry out a 2-D Land Seismic Survey involving about 3100 L km Data Acquisition including Data Processing and Interpretation and related services under Fast Track Programme Bangladesh Oil, Gas, Mineral Corporation (Petrobangla) issued notice on 17.09.2009 (Annexure-C) for Expression of Interest(EOI) to be submitted by the interested internationally reputed geophysical contractors having required qualifications, as stated therein, for short listing Seismic contractor/firm with supporting documents in support of the experience on or before 12:00 (BST) on 28.10.2009 in sealed envelop to the Director(Planning) Petrobangla, Petrocentre;3, Kawran Bazar, Dhaka, Commercial area, Dhaka.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>   In response, BGP (Bangladesh) International submitted its EOI allegedly without any date or signature stating, <em>inter alia,</em> that it was submitted by BGP (Pakistan) International and that “BGP (Pakistan) International” is responsive to receive and prepare tender bid package and make necessary arrangement to carry out the respective work. However, CGG Varitas, France also submitted EOI on 20.10.2009 (Annexure-I-A). At this juncture, Mr. Mahmud, the learned Senior Advocate submits that respondent no.8 cannot make a complaint before the respondent no.3 since it did not submit any EOI nor in the EOI CGG Varitas, France has been identified as a joint venture company with respondent no.8. Rather, in the subsequent letter dated 05.06.2010 (Annexure-I-D) CGG Varitas, France appears to have submitted proposal in association with 3(three) sub-contractors and respondent no.8 is one of those 3 (three).<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>   However, CGG Veritas, France while issuing 2<sup>nd</sup> letter on the same date i.e., 05.06.2010 has introduced respondent no.8 as a sub-contractor contending, <em>inter alia-,“Arneeb Enterprise, PBL Tower (11<sup>th</sup> floor), 17 Kemal Atanturk Avenue, Gulshan-2, Dhaka-1212, Bangladesh-Sub-Contractor. Enem Express Ltd., Chartered Accountant Bhaban (2<sup>nd</sup> floor), 100 kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue, Kawran Bazar, Dhaka-1215, Bangladesh-Sub-Contractor. Yean Tun Chinese, Thai &amp; Indian Restaurant, 50,Tejkunipara, Airport Road, Tejgaon, Dhaka-1215, Bangladesh-Sub-Contractor</em>.<em>”</em><br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>   While narrating profiles of the respective contractors it has further been stated, <em>inter alia-, </em>“<strong>SUB-CONTRACTOR: ARNEEB Enterprise </strong><em>Arneeb Enterprise’s is a local company experience with more than 25 years in performing the job for supplying Casual Labour with foods subsidy &amp; PPE with other various logistic supply to petrobangla and its various companies like BAPEX, BGFCL, SGFL and IOC’s like Shill, Occidental Unocal, Chevron and Tullow. Arneeb enterprise also works as agent and seismic crew supplier of CGG Veritas since 1980 for various Clients from IOC to NOC.  Arneeb Enterprise amalgamated with N&amp;N Corporation and UME under the same ownership is well known in hydrocarbon industry of Bangladesh for last nearly 30 years. Its access to highly skilled personnel translates into solutions that are both cost effective and of high quality thereby minimizing quality, which is the driving force behind its work.”</em><br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>   It, thus, reflects that earlier respondent no.8 also worked as an agent of CGG Varitas, France. However, for submitting EOI with regard to the international bid in question it has been identified as a “sub-contractor”. At this stage, the learned Advocate for the respondent No. 8 goes to argue that the interest of sub-contractor comes into play with the submission of REP. Since in the present case proposal has been submitted by CGG Veritas, France, respondent No. 8 has every right to restrain a stranger who at no point of time (before declaring the short listed contractors) participated in the process of the tender in question.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>   In order to understand the position of “sub-contractor” first we require to understand the position of the “Contractor”. The word “ঠিকাদার”, the Contractor, has been defined in section 2(10) of the Act no.24 of 2006 as has been adopted in rule 2(18) of the Rules, 2008, which provides as under-“ঠিকাদার’’ অর্থ এই আইনের অধীন কোন কার্য সম্পাদনের উদ্দেশ্যে ক্রয়কারীর সহিত চুক্তি সম্পাদনকারী ব্যক্তি।’’<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>   In other words, a “contractor” means the person who has entered into a contract with the Procuring Entity to accomplish a work which has been undertaken under the Act No. 24 of 2006. The Act No. 24 of 2006, however, is silent about the definition of “sub-contractor”.  The same has been defined in rule 2(56) of the Rules’ 2008, which is quoted herein below-‘‘সহ-ঠিকাদার (sub-contractor)” বলিতে <u>চুক্তিবদ্ধ কার্যের কোন অংশ </u>  <u>সম্পাদনের জন্য ঠিকাদারের সহিত</u> চুক্তিবদ্ধ কোন ব্যক্তি বা বিধিবদ্ধ সংস্থাকে বুঝাইবে এবং নির্বাচিত স্থানে কাজও উহার অমত্মর্ভূক্ত হইবে।’’ (Emphasis  given).<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>   In other words a “sub-contractor” comes into play when a contract has been concluded with the Contractor and the Procuring Entity. Subsequent thereto a separate contract is executed between the “Contractor” and the “Sub-contractor” in order to complete the contractual works. However, rule 53 provides for appointment of a “Sub-contractor”, which runs as follows:- “<strong>সহ-ঠিকাদার বা সহ-পরার্মশক নিয়োগ</strong>।- (১)  ক্রয়কারী, আদর্শ দরপত্র বা প্রসত্মাব দাখিলের অনুরোধ সম্বলিত দলিলে উল্লিখিত যথাযথ যোগ্যতা থাকার সমর্থনে প্রয়োজনীয় কাগজপত্র দাখিল করা সাপেক্ষে, কোন সরবরাহকারী, ঠিকাদার বা পরামর্শককে সহ-ঠিকাদার বা সহ-পরামর্শক নিয়োগের অনুমতি প্রদান করিতে পারিবে। (২) সহ-পরামর্শক হিসাবে কোন প্রসত্মাবে উল্লিখিত কোন প্রতিষ্ঠান (ভরৎস) একাধিক প্রসত্মাবে অংশগ্রহণ করিতে পারিবে, তবে উক্ত অংশগ্রহণ শুধু সহ-পরামর্শক হিসাবেই করিতে হইবে। (৩) দরপত্রে সুনির্দিষ্টভাবে উল্লিখিত সহ-ঠিকাদারের যোগ্যতা ঠিকাদারের যোগ্যতা মূল্যায়নে শুধু তাহার (সহ-ঠিকাদারের) জন্য নির্ধারিত কাজের ক্ষেত্রে বিবেচনা করা যাইতে পারে। (৪) সহ-ঠিকাদারের সাধারণ অভিজ্ঞতা এবং আর্থিক সম্পদ দরপত্রদাতার সাধারণ অভিজ্ঞতা ও আর্থিক সম্পদের সহিত যোগ করা যাইবে না। (৫) কোন আবেদনকারী যদি ব্যক্তিগতভাবে, বা যৌথ উদ্যেগের অংশীদার হিসাবে কোন প্রসত্মাব দাখিল করে, তাহা হইলে একই ক্রয় পক্রিয়ায় অন্য কোন আবেদনকারীর সহ-পরামর্শক হিসাবে তিনি গ্রহণযোগ্য হইবে না। (৬) <u>সহ-ঠিকাদার বা সহ-পরামর্শক নিয়োগ সত্ত্বেও, সংশ্লিষ্ট ক্রয় চুক্তির অধীন পালনযোগ্য দায়-দায়িত্ব সম্পর্ণরুপে সরবরাহকারী, ঠিকাদার ও পরামর্শকের উপর ন্যসত্ম থাকিবে এবং উক্ত দায়-দায়িত্ব সহ-ঠিকাদার বা সহ-পরামর্শকের নিকট হসত্মামত্মর করা যাইবে না, বা কোন অবস্থাতেই চুক্তিবদ্ধ দায়-দায়িত্ব সহ-ঠিকাদার বা সহ-পরামর্শকের নিকট অর্পণের অনুমতি প্রদান করা যাইবে না।</u> (বসঢ়যধংরং মরাবহ) (৭) মুখ্য সরবরাহকারী বা ঠিকাদার বা পরামর্শক তাহার সহ-ঠিকাদার বাসহ-পরামর্শকগনের ব্যবস্থাপনার জন্য দায়ী থাকিবে, এবং সাব-কণ্ট্রাক্টসমূহে ব্যাপরে ক্রয়কারীর পর্যালোচনা সাধারণত মুখ্য সরবরাহকারী বা ঠিকাদার বা পরামর্শক কর্তৃক সাব-কণ্ট্রাক্টসমূহ ব্যবস্থাপনাগত মূল্যানের মধ্যেই সীমিত থাকিবে।’’<br/> <br/>        In consideration of the said provisions of the Rules, 2008 we find no substance in the arguments so has been advanced by the learned Advocate for the respondent No. 8. Rather, we are of the view that the duties and responsibilities under the contract squarely lies upon the “Contractor” and under no circumstances can it be shifted to the “Sub-contractor”. Keeping that view in mind it was CGG Veritas, France, a short listed contractor, who was entitled to lodge complaint, if there be any, against BGP (Bangladesh) International. The said finding of ours is further fortified from section 29 of the Act no.24 of 2006 which provides the right to lodge complaint; “২৯। <strong>অভিযোগ করার অধিকার।-</strong> (১) কোন ব্যক্তি এই আইনের অধীন ক্রয়কারীর উপর অর্পিত দায়িত্ব পালনে ব্যর্থতার জন্য ক্ষতিগ্রসত্ম হইলে বা তাহার ক্ষতিগ্রসত্ম হইবার সম্ভাবনা থাকিলে তিনি উক্ত ক্রয়কারীর বিরুদ্ধে ধারা ৩০ এ বর্ণিত কর্তৃপক্ষের নিকট অভিযোগ দায়ের করিতে পরিবেন।  (২) নিম্নবর্ণিত ক্ষেত্রে উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীন কোন অভিযোগ দায়ের করা যাইবে না যথা:- (ক) পণ্য, কার্য বা সেবা ক্রয় পদ্ধতি নির্বাচন; (খ) কোন আবেদনকারীর সংক্ষিপ্ত তালিকাভুক্তির আবেদন প্রত্যাখ্যান; (গ) যে সকল ক্ষেত্রে নিম্নবর্ণিত সিদ্ধান্ত গৃহীত হইয়াছে-(অ) প্রাক-যোগ্যতার আবেদন, দরপত্র, কোটেশন বা প্রস্তাব বাতিল করিবার সিদ্ধামত্ম; বা(আ) সরকারী ক্রয় সংক্রান্ত মন্ত্রিসভা কমিটি কর্তৃক অনুমোদনের পরিপ্রেক্ষিতে চুক্তি সম্পাদনের সিদ্ধাস্ত।<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>   Here, the important word is “ব্যওিু”, the person who may file complaint. The definition of “person” or “ব্যওিু” has been provided in section 2(23) of the Act no. 24 of 2006, as adopted in rule 2(41) of the Rules, 2008, which states as follows: “ব্যওিু অর্থ এুয় কর্মকান্ডে অংশগ্রহণে আগ্রহী ব্যওিু, ব্যওিুবর্গ, ব্যওিু মালিকানা প্রতিষ্ঠান, অংশীদার কারবার, কোম্পানী, সংঘ বা সমবায় সমিতি;”<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>   In other words, persons are those who aspire to participate in the bidding process. Considering the said definition and the definitions of “Contractor”, and “Sub-contractor” the word “ব্যওিু” as appeared in section 29 of the Act can only go to mean the bidder (the “contractor”), not the “sub-contractor” since his interest comes to play when a separate contract is entered into with the contractor and the sub-contractor. That be the case, a complaint can only be maintained before the authority concern by the contractor, not the sub-contractor. As such, filing complaint by the respondent No. 8 is not maintainable in the eye of law.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>   The next issue which needs consideration is against whom the complaint may be made.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>   Rule 56 of the Rules’ 2008 protects the right to file complaint against “­কান এুয়কারী ব্যওিু” on the ground as stated therein. Rule 56 is quoted herein below. “৫৬। অভিযোগ করার অধিকার।- নিম্নবর্ণিত ক্ষেত্রে বা পরিস্থিতিতে কোন ক্রয়কারীর বিরুদ্ধে আনুষ্ঠানিক অভিযোগ দায়ের করা যাইবে, যথাঃ- (ক) প্রাক-যোগ্যতা নির্ধারণের ক্ষেত্রে- (১) বিজ্ঞাপন প্রকাশিত হওয়ার তারিখে প্রাক-যোগ্যতার দলিল প্রস্ত্তত করা না থাকিলে বা সম্ভাব্য আবেদনকারীর অনুরোধে উহা প্রাপ্তিসাধ্য না করা গেলে; বা (২) সম্ভাব্য আবেদনকারীর স্পষ্টীকরণের চাহিদার পরিপ্রেক্ষিতে যথাসময়ে তৎসম্পর্কে ব্যাখ্যা প্রদান না করা হইলে; বা (৩) প্রাক-যোগ্যতার দলিলে উল্লিখিত নির্ণায়কের আলোকে মূল্যায়ন কমিটি যোগ্যতা মূল্যায়ন করিতে ব্যর্থ হইলে; বা (৪) প্রাক-যোগ্যতা নির্ধার অন্যায়ভাবে অস্বীক তি জ্ঞাপন করা হইয়াছে মর্মে ধারণা করিবার সঙ্গত কারণ থাকিলে ; বা দূর্নীতি বা চক্রামত্মমূলক কার্যকলাপ সম্পর্কে সন্দেহ হইলে। (খ) উন্মুক্ত, সীমিত, সরাসরি, দুই-পর্যায় ও কোটেশন পদ্ধতির ক্ষেত্রে- (১) প্রযোজ্য ক্ষেত্রে, বিধি ৯০ অনুসরণক্রমে বিজ্ঞাপন প্রদান করা না হইয়া  থাকিলে; বা প্রযোজ্য ক্ষেত্রে, বিজ্ঞাপন প্রকাশিত হওয়ার তারিখে দরপত্র দলিল প্রস্ত্তত না হইয়া থাকিলে বা সম্ভাব্য দরপত্র দাতাবা কোটেশনদাতার অনুরোধে উহা প্রাপ্তিসাধ্য করা না গেলে; বা সম্ভাব দরপত্র দাতার অনুরোধে যথাসময়ে ব্যাখ্যা প্রদান না করা  হইলে; বা কেবল একটি স্বল্পসংখ্যক প্রস্ত্তকারী প্রতিষ্ঠান কর্তৃক পূরণ করা  সম্ভব, এইরূপ কারিগরি বিনির্দেশ প্রস্ত্তত করা হইলে ; বা প্রকাশিত বিজ্ঞাপনের শর্ত মোতাবেক, প্রযোজ্য ক্ষেত্রে, প্রাক-দরপত্র সভ্য অনুষ্ঠান করিতে ব্যর্থ হইলে বা উক্ত সভার জন্য পূর্ব নির্ধারিত  তারিখ, স্থান ও সময় পরিবর্তিত হইলে যথাসময়ে উহা সম্ভাব্য  দরপত্র দাতাগণকে অবহিত না করার কারণে সম্ভাব্য কতিপয়  দরপত্রদাতা সভায় যোগদান করিতে সক্ষম না হই দরপত্র আহবানের বিজ্ঞাপণে প্রদত্ত বিবৃতি মোতাবেক দরপত্র উম্মুক্ত করিতে ব্যর্থ হইলে বা দরপত্র উন্মুক্তকরণের সময় অসঙ্গত আচরণ করা হইলে; বিশৃঙ্খলাভাবে পরিচালনার ফলে এক বা একাধিক দরপত্র নির্ধারিত  সময়ের পূর্বেই উন্মুক্তক্রমে উহার গোপনীয়তা ফাঁসকরিয়া দেও প্রকাশ্য সভায় দরপত্র উন্মুক্তকরণে ব্যর্থ হইলে ; বা দরপত্র দাখিলের জন্যনির্ধারিত সময়ের পূর্বে প্রাপ্ত সক উন্মুক্তকরণ করা না হইলে ; বা  মূল্যায়নকমিটি দরপত্র দলিলে উল্লিখিত নির্ণায়ককের আলোকেদরপত্র মূল্যায়ন করিতেব্যর্থ হই (১০) ক্রয়কারী কর্তৃক কৃতকার্য দরপত্রদাতার সহিত নিগোসিয়েশনের উদ্যেগ গ্রহণ করা হইলে (১১) দুর্নীতি বা চক্রামত্মমূলক কার্যকলাপ সম্পর্কে  সন্দেহ হই((১২) ত্রুটিপূর্ণ বা অন্যায্যভাবে চুক্তি সম্পাদন করা হইয়াছে বলিয়া করিবার সঙ্গত কারণ থাকিলে ; বা (১৩) দুই পর্যায়বিশিষ্ট দরপত্র পদ্ধতি প্রয়োগের ক্ষেত্রে, প্রথম পর্যাদেরপত্র মূল্যায়নের সময় প্রত্যেক ব্যক্তির নিকট হইতে ব্যাখ্য গ্রহণের সময় গোপনীয়তা রক্ষার শর্ত লংঘন করা হইলে। (গ) প্রসত্মাব দাখিলের অনুরোধ জ্ঞাপনের ক্ষেত্রে- (১) কারিগরি প্রসত্মাবের খাম উন্মুক্তকরণের পর ক্রয়কারী গোপনীয়তা রক্ষা করিতে ব্যর্থ হইলে; বা (২) কারিগরি প্রসত্মাব উন্মুক্তকরণের সময় আর্থিক প্রসত্মাব খোলা হইলে ; (৩) প্রসত্মাব দলিলে উল্লিখিত নির্ণায়কের ভিত্তিতে প্রসত্মাব মূল্যায়ন কব্যির্থ হইলে ; বা<br/>(৪) মূল্য যেখানে মূল্যায়নের একটি নিয়ামক (ভধপঃড়ৎ), সেইক্ষেত্রে নিগোসিয়েশনের সময় আবেদনকারীকে তৎপ্রসত্মাবিত ফিসের হার পরিবর্তনের জন্য চাপ প্রয়োগ করা হইলে ; বা<br/>(৫) দুর্নীতি বা চক্রামত্মমূলক কার্যকলাপ সম্পর্কে সন্দেহ হইলে; বা<br/>(৬) অন্যায্য ও পক্ষপাতিত্বপূর্ণভাবে চুক্তি সম্পাদন করা হইয়াছে বলিয়াধারণা করিবার সঙ্গত কারণ থাকিলে।’’  <br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>   Initially the complaint was filed by the respondent No. 8 before the respondent no.6, the Procuring Entity, against BGP Inc., CNPC who is claiming to be the integral part of BGP (Bangladesh) International pursuant to letter dated 24.05.2010 (Annexure-F-1) contending, <em>inter alia,-</em>“<em>We have been granted permission from the Board of investment (BOI) for opening a Branch Office in Bangladesh via BOI letter No BOI/R&amp;1-1 (Com)/Branch/ 2935/09/2752 dated 25-11-2009 and 18 B permission from Bangladesh Bank via letter No. FEID/729/B960/2010-154 dated 25/01/2010 as BGP Inc. China National Petroleum Corporation BGP Inc. also registered with register of Joint Companies &amp; Firms under No. F667 issue No. 34442-48 dated 25-02-2010 and Tax Identification Certificate from the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes No 176-201-8105/Coy-17 dated 20-05-2010. To comply with these permission BGP Inc. China National Petroleum Corporation has been working in Bangladesh as Branch Office at 69/1 New Circular Road, Malibagh , Dhaka.</em>  p-120 ”<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>   However, on perusal of Annexure-D it appears that EOI has been filed by BGP (Pakistan) Internati-onal on behalf of BGP (Bangladesh) International. Along with the EOI the said company also submitted the documents of experience, capacity as well as the Articles of Associations of BGP Inc., CNPC.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>   In this regard, it is the emphatic contention of the petitioner-company that though there is some unintentional anomally in the cover page of EOI but said EOI consists of the entire volume of documents wherefrom it is evident that BGP Inc., CNPC. is, in fact, making the proposal and that before filing RFP the petitioner-company has duly sent a letter of clarification. It is fact that accepting such anomally, as is apparent from the records, respondent no.6 vide letter dated 11.04.2010 short listed 8 (eight) contra-ctors where CGG Veritas, France has been placed at serial no.4 and BGP (Bangladesh) International has been posted at serial No. 6. Neither CGG Veritas, France nor respondent no.8 within the four corners of it’s complaint raised objection against such short listing. The claim of the respondent no.8 squarely lies on the issue that since BGP (Bangladesh) International has been short listed as such RFP submitted by the petitioner-company on 10.06.2010 (Annexure-F) is unlawful, hence BGP (Bangladesh) International has been rightly declared as non-responsive.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong>   As has already been noted above, a complaint cannot be made by a sub-contractor against a short listed contractor in view of rule 56 of the Rules, 2008. However, in this regard Mr. Nurul Amin drawing attention to sub-rule 9 of rule 56 submits that alleging  non-evaluation of RFP as per law on possible conspiracy the instant complaint has been lodged hence, it fulfils the criterias as have been set out in the said provision. Sub-rule 9 of rule 56 comes into play when the Evaluation Committee fails to. The said stage has not reached yet. The issue being agitated by respondent No. 8 is presenting RFP by BGP Inc., CNPC for being a separate entity from BGP (Bangladesh) International. In view of the same the arguments so made by Mr. Amin is of no substance in the facts and circumstance of the case.  The fact remains that Petrobangla considered the EOI of BGP (Bangladesh) International as appropriate, (Annexure-D) and short listed the same as contractor, whereas the Review Panel-1 declared the said contractor as non responsive on the count that BGP Inc., CNPC being a separate entity cannot file RFP. The said decision has been given without giving opportunity to BGP (Bangladesh) International to represent their part of the case.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong>   The present writ petition has been filed by BGP Inc., CNPC Their claim is that they are the integral part of BGP (Bangladesh) International on the basis of certain documents, enclosed with the EOI and tried to clarify the ambiguity with regard to the name of the company since BGP (Bangladesh) International has been short listed<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong>   No doubt, there is serious anomally over the ambiguity of the petitioner-company who filed RFP, which is still lying pending before the Evaluation Committee for consideration and above all as per ITC clause 5.1 filing RFP is limited to short list contractors only. As such, since BGP (Bangladesh) International has been declared non-responsive the said short-listed contractor is the appropriate aggrieved person to maintain this writ petition, not BGP Inc., CNPC.<br/> <br/><strong>27.</strong>   Be that as it may, the respondent no.8 being a “sub-contractor” it’s right and interest lies with the short-listed contactor CGG veritas, France who does not appear to have authorized the said respondent to file complaint to the concern authority against BGP Inc., CNPC in order to oust BGP (Bangladesh) International without making it a party. Hence, has no <em>locus standi </em>to maintain the complaint before the Review Panel-1, respondent No. 3.<br/> <br/><strong>28.</strong>   The bid reaches its finality through stages; firstly, before the Procuring Entity, who selects the short listed contractors; then the RFP, submitted by those contractors, are evaluated by the Evaluation Committee “মূল্যায়ন কমিটি” and then it is finally approved by the Approval Authority, “অনুমোদনকারী কর্তৃপক্ষ” as defined in section 2(1) of the Act no.24 of 2006. In the present case, the Procuring Entity short listed 8 (eight) contractors and the RFP submitted by them are still lying pending for consideration before the Evaluation Committee, either to be declared responsive or non-responsive. Moreover, the allegation was against BGP (Bangladesh) International whose right to be declared responsive or non-responsive has been adjudicated and disposed of by the respondent No. 3 without making it a party and without issuing notice providing opportunity  to defend it’s part of the case by adducing documents, which is a flagrant violation of the principle of natural justice.<br/> <br/><strong>29.</strong>   In view of the facts, circumstance, observations and findings made above the impugned order dated 10.02.2011 passed by the respondent no.3 is declared to have been passed without lawful authority and hence, of no legal effect.<br/> <br/><strong>30.</strong>   However, CGG Veritas, France, a short listed company is at liberty to file a complaint afresh, if so desires and the respondent no. 3 is hereby directed to adjudicate the complaint, if so made, upon giving proper notice to BGP (Bangladesh) International, in accordance with law.<br/> <br/><strong>31.</strong>   With the above observations this Rule is disposed of. There will be no order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Rules.  1955) (i.e. proceeding known as khanapuri, Bujaral, Attestation, objection and  Appeal) 1.20 acres of land covered by D.P. Khatian No. 237 of Mouza Shantinagar, under Police Station Motijheel, District-Dhaka were recorded in the names of Hazi Zahirul Islam, Jainal Abedin, Hazi Mahbubul Islam, Mojibul Islam (the petitioner Nos. l, 2, 3 5) and 8 others, 0.4050 acre of land covered by  D.P.khatian No. 155 were recorded in the name of Hazi Zahirul Islam (The Petitioner No. 1), 0.0730 acre land covered by D.P. Khatian No. 125 were recorded in the name of Kamal Uddin (the petitioner No. 4) and 0.0078 acre land covered by D.P.Khatian No. 245 were recorded in the name of Mojibul Islam( the petitioner No. 5).<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>      The petitioners   and   their   other   co-sharers   have  been owning  and possessing a total 1.837 acres of land covered by the aforesaid 4 khatians No. 237, 155, 125 and 245 and some other lands total being 3.21 acres from the time of their predecessors namely Hazi Hafizuddin, Afsaruddin and Md. Taher who purchased the 3.21 acres of land including the lands covered by the aforesaid four D.P. khatians from its lawful owners Bamacharan Pal, Boloram Pal, Hororam Pal and Gupal Chandra Pal by registered sale deed No.4911 dated 26.08.1952 and have been owning and possessing the same by constructing residential-cum-commercial building.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>      While the predecessors of the petitioners were owning and possessing the aforesaid 3.21 acres of land along with the building thereon, including the land covered by aforesaid four I) D.P. Khatians, the then Dhaka Improvement Trust (DIT) issued notice for requisition of 2.19 acre of land including the land covered by 4 khatians for the purpose of acquisition for constructing North South Koad by starting L.A, Case No.8/65-66 through the A.D.C. (L.A), Dhaka. Subsequently the aforesaid 2.19 acre of land was de-requisitioned by nonce dated 24<sup>th</sup> April 1968,<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>    The land covered by the order of derequisition    as well as of 4 D.P. khatians as mentioned above were wrongly recorded in the name of Collector, Dhaka as khas land but at the time of preparation of R.S. record the land in question was duly and correctly ordered to be recorded in the name of petitioner No.5 and the predecessors of other petitioners and other co-sharers in Settlement Appeal Case No. I 53 and accordingly R.S. and D.P. khatian No.53 was prepared though the respondent  No.4 did not participate in any proceeding under rules 28 to 31 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act Rules 1955 at the time of operation of R.S. record of right before the survey and settlement authority but fraudulently entered his name in the said R.S. khatian at the time of final publication in collusion with the staffs of the Settlement Press and on the basis of the said fraudulent R.S. khatian managed to have recorded his name in the recent Mohanagari Record of Right against which the petitioners and others filed objection Case No. 10, 12, 61, 40, 41, 43, 57, 24, 30, 46, 44, 47, 48, 42, 28, 25, 22 and   69 under rule 30 of S.A. and T Rules, 1955. The objection officer heard both the parties and allowed the objection Case No. 10 and   12 by analogous judgment dated 23.6.1999.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>    Against the said judgment passed by the objection officer respondent Nos. 4 and 5 preferred Settlement Appeal Case No. 2846/99, 2847/90. 2849/99, 2850/99, 2857/99, 2858/99, 2859/99 and 3025/99 under rule 31 of S.A. and T Act Rules, 19955 and being refused by the Appeal Officer preferred writ petition No.1103 of 1999 before this Court without impleading the petitioners and their co-sharers and obtained rule. The present petitioner Nos. l -3 and 5 and other co-sharers on being added as party in that writ petition contested the Rule which was discharged on 25.07.2001 by this Court. After that the Appeal Officer heard   both   the parties and dismissed the said appeal   cases by analogous judgment dated 9<sup>th</sup> April 2002 (annexure -D and D-1).<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>      It is further stated that after the judgment given in the appeal eases under rule 31 there is no provision other than to send the D.P. khatian to the Settlement Press for final publication under rule 32 of S.A. and T. Rules,  1995 and the petitioners were waiting for such finally published khatian but all on a sudden on 3<sup>rd</sup> February 2003 the petitioners obtained separated 8 notices issued under the   signature   of Settlement Officer, Dhaka, the respondent No. 3 dated 01.2.2003 for re-hearing of the self name Appeal Case Nos. 2846/99, 2847/ 99, 2849/99. 2850/99, 2857/99, 2858/99, 2859 /99 and 3025/99 under rule 31 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy   Rules, 1955 by giving a reference of Miscellaneous case No. 760 of 2002. It is at this stage the petitioner moved this Division under Article 102 of the constitution and obtained the present Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>    Mr. Md. Khalilur Rahman, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners after taking us with the petition, the impugned notices and other annexure with the petition, mainly pressed that the impugned notices dated 01.2.2003 for re-hearing of the appeal Case Nos. 2846/99, 2847/99, 2849/99, 2850/99, 2857/99, 2858/99, 2859/99 and 3025/99 afresh has been issued Without any lawful authority and without jurisdiction which should be declared un-constitutional. In elaborating his argument the learned Advocate submits that the notices for re-hearing of the appeal cases is absolutely in violation of State Acquisition and Tenancy Rules, 1955. lie submits that once the appeal has been disposed of on contest under-rule 31 no review or other application lies and settlement authority has no jurisdiction to re-open the mailer other than to send the draft application khatian for final publication in the settlement press under Rule 32 of the S.A and T Rules, 1955. This is well settled as he submits. In support of his contentions he placed reliance on the decision of Romisa Khanam Vs. Bangladesh 61 DLR 18, (where one of us was a party), Md. Abtab Ali Sheikh Vs. Director of Land Records 11 MLR 226 and Capital Co-operative Housing Society Ltd. Vs. Bangladesh 45 DLR 289.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>      Mr. S.R.M. Lutfor Rahman Akand, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent No.4 and 5 by filing affidavit-in-opposition, on the other hand, opposes the  Rule and submits that  this writ petition  should be discharged in that the impugned notices in respect of filing of the Miscellaneous Case No. 760 of 2002 for re-hearing, of appeal eases Nos. 2846/99. 2847/99, 2849/99, 285O/99, 2857/99, 2858/99, 2859/99 and 3025/99 is absolutely in accordance with law since the same has been permitted under Rule 42 of the Tenancy Rules, 1955. He submits that Rule 42 clearly provides that settlement authority has jurisdiction to re-hear (he appeal before publication of the record of right and hence the instant writ petition filed against those notices regarding re-hearing   of  the   appeals   is   not   maintainable   under   Article   102   of  the constitution<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>   We have heard the learned advocate for both sides at length and considered their submissions. We have also perused the petition, impugned notices, other annexures appended to the petition and the affidavit-in-opposition carefully. The matter is well settled by this Court as well as the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>    In the ease of Romisa Khanam Vs. Bangladesh in which one of us was a party, Justice M.A. Rashid (as he then was) while dealing with the same point observed as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"In the scheme of revision of a record-of-rights under </em><em>section 144 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950</em> <em>there are various stages </em><em>laid</em><em> down in the Rules, 1955.</em><em> After completion of attestation, the Revenue Officer shall under Rule 29 publish the draft record-of-rights for public inspection. Under Rule 30, the Revenue Officer shall decide summarily in presence of the interested parties any objection regarding ownership or possession of land or of any interest in land. Any person aggrieved by such an order on any objection made under Rule 30 may appeal to the Revenue Officer appointed with additional designation of Settlement Officer or of Assistant Settlement Officer commonly known as Appellate Officer within 30 days from the date of order appealed against. Any order passed on such appeal appears to be final as no further appeal or revision is provided there from.  </em><br/><br/><em>After disposal of the objections under Rule 30 and </em><em>appeals under 31 and correction of the draft record-of-rights </em><em>in accordance with the original and appellate orders on all objections, the Revenue Officer shall proceed to frame final record of rights under Rule 31 and then, publish record of rights under Rule 33. Under Rule 34, the Revenue Officer </em><em>shall within sixty days of the fina publication make a </em><em>certificate stating the fact of such final publication and the </em><em>date thereof, etc. And the Government by a notification in the official gazette may declare with regard to any specified area that the record-of-rights has been finally published for every village included in such area and such notification shall be conclusive proof of such publication.</em><br/><br/><em>Chapter VIII of said Rules, 1955 deals with general </em><em>power of Revenue Officer in revising record-of-rights under </em><em>section 144 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950. </em><em>Rule 42 gives special power to a Revenue Officer appointed with additional designation of Settlement Officer to direct at </em><em>any time before the publication of the final record of rights </em><em>that any portion of the proceedings referred to in rules 28 to </em><em>32 in respect of any district, part of a district or local area </em><em>shall be cancelled and the proceedings shall be taken up fresh from such stage as he may direct. Similarly, such Settlement Officer is empowered under Rule 42A upon an application or receipt of an Official Report to correct any entry that has been procured by fraud in record-of-rights before final publication, and after consulting the relevant records and making such other enquiries as he deems necessary, to direct excision of the fraudulent entry and his act in doing so shall not be open to an appeal. At the same time, the Revenue Officer shall make the correct entry after hearing the parties and record his finding in a formal proceeding for the purpose of future reference. Bui none of such powers under Rule 42 or 42A of the Rules, 1955 appears to empower such Settlement Officer to sit and or act as an appellate authority over an appellate order passed under Rule 31 and se aside such, appellate order or direct the Appellate Officer to hear an appeal afresh in respect of a particular holding. Nor the Appellate Officer is empowered to rehear an appeal which was finally disposed by him. The Settlement Officer therefore most illegally cancelled the appellate orders and compelled the Appellate Officer to hear the appeals afresh</em>."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>12.</strong>   Against this decision Bhawal Raj Court of Wards Estate who was the respondent in the said case unsuccessfully moved the Appellate Division in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 1447-52 of 2008. The Appellate Division finally set at rest of the same once for all. All other decisions as referred to above are on the same point and all these decisions settled the proposition of law that once appeal has been disposed of on contest under Rule 3 1 of Stale Acquisition and Tenancy Rules, 1955 no review or other application lies and the settlement authority have got no jurisdiction to re-open the matter other than to send the draft publication khatian for final publication under Rule 32 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Rules, 1955. Even Rule 42 docs not empower the Settlement Officer to sit and act as an appellate authority over an appellate order passed under Rule 31 of the Stale Acquisition and Tenancy Rules 1955. In that view of the mailer, this Rule is made absolute without any order as to cost. The impugned 8(eight) notices dated 01.2.2003 issued under the signature of respondent No. 3, the Settlement Officer is hereby declared to have  been passed without any lawful authority and as such no legal effect and it is also directed to send the draft publication khatian No. 237,155,125 and 245 of Mouza Santinagar, Police Station Motijhcel, Dhaka prepared in the name of the petitioners to the settlement press for final publication.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

The Sessions Judge, Additional Sessions Judge and Joint Sessions Judge are all the judges of a sessions division and in view of the provision of Section 7(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure a Metropolitan Area is deemed to be a sessions division for the purpose of the Code. As such the submissions of the learned Advocate cannot be accepted that the Joint Sessions Judge being an inferior Court of the Sessions Judge has no jurisdiction to try the case. Section 17A of the Code of Criminal Procedure clearly has empowered a Sessions Judge to distribute the business among such Joint Sessions Judge subordinate to him from time to time making rules or give Special order consistent with the Code. ....

Thus, the submission of the learned Advocate for the accused petitioner that the Court of Sessions being the trial Court can not be the Appellate Court is absolutely misconceived and ridiculous. If the trial is held before the Joint Sessions Judge and the accused is convicted then obviously, the appeal has to be preferred in the Court of Sessions Judge, in view of the provision of Section 408 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. May be, this provision of law is not good and inconsistence with the spirit of fair justice or rule of prudence; but, unless law is strike down or amended there is no scope to interfere with the proceeding or to quash the same on the ground that the existing law is bad one or inconsistence with it’s object. ...

Because of such order of default a gap has been created between the relation of the client and the lawyer and if the case is not restored to its original filed and number the petitioner will be prejudiced seriously.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>      In the Case of Sonatoon Nessa -Vs- Haipattullah Sarker, reported in 41 DLR(AD),  Page-105 our Appellate Division discouraged the restoration of a case when no useful purpose will be served in allowing the such restoration and a litigant instead being benefited in any manner will be driven to a fruitless litigation if restoration is allowed.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>      Let us now decide the fate of the present application for restoration keeping the above proposition of law in our mind. <br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>      We have gone through the application for restoration and as well as the application under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>      In course of the submission the learned Advocate for the petitioner admitted that the petitioner filed the application under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure before this Court after completion of the examination of the witnesses and 18.04.2011 was fixed for argument. It shows that the petitioner has not come before this Court with clean hand.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>      In the application for restoration no explanation has been furnished by the petitioner or his learned Advocate what step was taken from 12.07.2011 to 03.01.2012.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>      In the order dated 11.12.2011, rejecting the application for default, it has been   categorically mentioned that on 08.12.2011 the case appeared in the daily cause list with the name of the learned Advocate for the petitioner, but no one appeared to press the application when it was taken up for hearing and on that particular day the Court Suo-moto adjourned the hearing and on the following day when the matter was again taken up for hearing no one turned up to press the application and ultimately the application was rejected for default. With regard to the above observation of the Court the learned Advocate of the petitioner in his application for restoration has not furnished any explanation for his fault.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>    It is a settled proposition of law that when the taking of evidence has already been closed and date was fixed for argument at this stage interference in the proceeding of a Case in exercising the power under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not permissible.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>    The learned Advocate for the petitioner tried to impress us agitating the ground that in view of the provision of Section 141(C) of the Negotiable Instruments Act,1881 it is mandatory that the trial of the case, must be tried by the Court of Sessions not inferior to that of a Sessions Court and the Joint Sessions Judge being a subordinate to the Court of Sessions Judge has no jurisdiction to try the Case and as such the trial of the instant case by the Metropolitan Joint Sessions Judge 5<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka is nothing but an abuse of the process of the Court which is liable to be quashed. It was also the submission of the learned Advocate that if the instant Case is tried by Metropolitan Joint Sessions Judge and if any of the litigant of the case needs to move in the form of appeal against the said Judgment then he has to move before the Sessions Judge, which is a trial Court according to section 141(c) of the Negotiable Instruments Act and thus, trial Court itself can not be the appellate Court. Section 9 of the Code of Criminal  Procedure runs as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Court of Session.- </strong>(1) The Government shall establish a Court of Sessions for every sessions division and appoint a Judge of such Court; and the Court of sessions for a Metropolitan Area shall be called the metropolitan Court of Session.<br/>(2) The Government may, by general or special Order in the official Gazette, direct at what place or places the Court of Sessions shall hold its sitting; but, until such order is made, the Courts of Sessions shall hold their sittings as thereof.<br/>(3) The government may also appoint Additional Sessions Judges and Assistant Sessions Judges to exercise Jurisdiction in one or more such Courts.<br/>[(3A) The members of the Bangladesh Judicial Service shall be appointed as Sessions Judge, Additional Sessions Judge and Joint Sessions Judge in accordance with the rules framed by the president under the provision to Article 133 of the Constitution to exercise Jurisdiction in one or more of such areas.]</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>12.</strong>    Above provision of law clearly speaks that Government may also appoint Additional Sessions Judge and Assistant Sessions Judge (now Joint Sessions Judge) to exercise Jurisdiction in one or more such Courts.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>    We have gone through the relevant provision of law i.e. Section 141(C) of the Negotiable Instruments Act, Sections 7 and 9 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In section 141(c) of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 it clearly provides that the case under Section 138 of the said Act, must be tried by the Court of Sessions. The Sessions Judge, Additional Sessions Judge and Joint Sessions Judge are all the judges of a sessions division and in view of the provision of Section 7(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure a Metropolitan Area is deemed to be a sessions division for the purpose of the code. As such, we are unable to accept the submissions of the learned Advocate that the Joint Sessions Judge being an inferior Court of the Sessions Judge has no jurisdiction to try the case.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>    Section 17A of the Code of Criminal Procedure clearly has empowered a Sessions Judge to distribute the business among such Joint Sessions Judge subordinate to him from time to time making rules or give Special order consistent with the Code.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>    Further, Section 408 of the Code of Criminal Procedure already provides appeal to the Sessions Judge convicted on a trial held by a Joint Sessions Judge, when in any case a Joint Sessions Judge passes any sentence of imprisonment for a term below five years. Thus, the submission of the learned Advocate for the accused petitioner that the Court of Sessions being the trial Court can not be the Appellate Court is absolutely misconceived and ridiculous.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>    It is true that for committing offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 highest sentence is for a term of one year or with fine or with both. If the trial is held before the Joint Sessions Judge and the accused is convicted then obviously, the appeal has to be preferred in the Court of Sessions Judge, in view of the provision of Section 408 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>    May be, this provision of law is not good and inconsistence with the spirit of fair justice or rule of prudence; but, unless law is strike down or amended we have no authority or scope to interfere with the proceeding or to quash the same on the ground that the existing law is bad one or inconsistence with it’s object, in exercising the power under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>    The Case of Abdul Kashem and others Vs. The State, reported in 43 DLR(AD) 1991 as cited by the learned Advocate for the petitioner is not applicable in this Case. In that Case the appellate, revisional, reference and review power of the learned Additional Sessions Judge and Assistant Sessions Judge has been decided.<br/> <br/>         Having, discussed as above we are not inclined to allow the accused petitioner to drive to a fruitless litigation restoring the instant case to its file and number.<br/> <br/>         Accordingly, the application is rejected.  <br/> <br/>         Communicate the order at once.  <br/> <br/><strong>        Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

To enforce the decision of the Syndicate of BSMMU in the line of amicable settlement like a decree of suit for specific performance of contract the award was passed by the Tribunal. Hence the Tribunal has exceeded limit of its lawful authority in passing the award and thereby it has violated the provision of section 43(1) (a) (IV) of the Arbitration Act, 2001, the impugned judgment and order is maintained.  </strong><br/> <br/><em>An arbitration proceeding between  the  appellant Maisha Corporation (Pvt) Ltd. and the respondent Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (herein after will be called claimant-Company and B.S.M.M.U respectively) was started out of a dispute over the supply., acceptance, installation and commissioning of a Hospital Grade Laundry System( Washing Plant) for 2000 bed facilities at the B.S.M.M.U. ......(2)</em><br/> <br/><em>However, it is true that the supplier quoted a consolidated price in the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage tender document against some changed machineries and country of origin in respect of Boiler and of some items was not mentioned. Even then the purchaser issued notificat-ion of award and executed the contract. But such an omission or oversight cannot exonerate the first part company from supplying the machineries as agreed by it at the time of submitting first stage tender, which is a part of the contract as per deed of contract itself. So there was no scope for him to change quality of the machineries and country of origin at the second stage tender. It is evident that the learned Arbitrators in their judgment, while passing the Award, could not be satisfied that Washing Extractors supplied by first party were fully suitable, but stated <sup>“</sup>not totally unsuitable."   ....( 21)</em><br/> <br/><em>It appears that the contract was executed on the basis of specifications given in the first stage tender and price quotation of the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage tender. Deviation as detected from the first stage tender, on the basis of which the claimant-Company was made responsive, is not legally permissible.</em><br/><em>Moreover, notification of award dated 30.7.2006 and subsequent contract deed were executed on the basis of both the tenders, which is clear from those documents. If the contract was made on the basis of the 2<sup>nd</sup> tender alone, what is use of the first stage tender? Rather it has been included as valid documents in the deed of contract and notification of award. So it is totally unacceptable to us that the second stage tender is the only basis of the contract. ......( 23)</em><br/> <br/><em>Neither the claimant-Company supplied some of the machineries of the Plant namely: Washer Extractors, Flat Iron and Boiler of Denmark and U.S.A in origin in accordance with its own technical specification  in the first stage tender,  nor the  supplied Washing Plant can meet the full requirement of B.S.M.M.U's 2000 bedded Hospital keeping conformity within international standard as per the report of the experts. When it is apparent that the goods do not correspond to the specifications of the tender and are not also fit for the purpose for which it will be used, the purchaser may reject such goods or any part thereof, if it fails to pass any test or inspection as contemplated under Clause- 31.7 of the General Conditions of Contract (GCC). ...(28)</em><br/> <br/><em>When the contract is violated and amicable settlement failed, the B.S.M.M.U issued a letter dated 14.08.2008 on the Managing Director of Maisha Corporation (Pvt) Ltd. asking for replacement of Boiler, Washer Extractors and Flat Iron, and supply those components made in U.S.A and Denmark as per first stage tender documents. Such a letter cannot be treated as unreasonable and malafide. But on getting this letter, the claimant-company referred the matter to the Arbitrators without rectifying the wrong. ....( 29)</em><br/><em>The whole process was done very hurriedly. Moreover, when the claimant M.P. was nominated as Member of the Syndicate to see welfare of the B.S.M.M.U., he was not supposed to engage himself in business in the said public institution  ......( 31)</em><br/> <br/><em>So the Award to enforce a decision of the Syndicate, not being within the scope of arbitration, has clearly violated section 43(l)(a)(IV) of the Arbitration Act, 2001. ......( 32)</em><br/> <br/><em>When the matter was pending before the Amicable Settlement Committee, it was taken up by the Syndicate by inserting a supplementary agenda in the Meeting. Such an extraneous decision should not be imposed on the assigned Purchase Committee, which is legally responsible to accept or refuse to accept the supplied goods of the contract on valid ground. ......(39)</em><br/> <br/><em>The B.S.M.M.U. can be compelled to accept the Washing Plant as supplied by the Claimant- Company nor any price of the plant or compensation for any part thereof can be allowed to spend from the Public Fund.

As such, the Award is not legally sustainable.      .....(40)</em><br/> <br/><em>Neither there was any scope to enforce a decision of the Syndicate by the Tribunal nor any such prayer was made by the first party seeking arbitral award. Evidently the award was passed by the Tribunal to enforce the decision of the Syndicate in the line of amicable settlement proposed by the supplier like a decree of suit for specific performance of Contract. In doing so, the Tribunal appears to have exceeded limit of its lawful authority in passing the award and as such, the Tribunal appears to have violated the provision of section 43(I)(a)(IV) of the Arbitration Tribunal Act. 2001, which is obviously, a cogent ground for setting aside Arbitral Award. .....( 41)</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Mr. Abdul Quayum and<br/>Mr. Md.

Appeal under section 48 of the Arbitration Act, 2001 is directed against the judgment and order dated 1.12.2009 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Dhaka in Arbitration Misc. Case no. 543 of 2009 setting aside the Arbitral    Award dated 21.6.2009.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong>     The relevant facts for disposal of the Misc. Appeal may be stated as follows:<br/><br/>        An arbitration proceeding between  the  appellant Maisha Corporation (Pvt) Ltd. and the respondent Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (herein after will be called claimant-Company and B.S.M.M.U respectively) was started out of a dispute over the supply., acceptance, installation and commissioning of a Hospital Grade Laundry System (Washing Plant) for 2000 bed facilities at the B.S.M.M.U.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>     On 4.9.2009, the B.S.M.M.U published a notice in the newspaper inviting tender for procurement of Hospital Grade Laundry System to cover 2000 bedded hospital facilities. The appellant-claimant-company participated in the tender through its Managing Director, Md. Shahiduzzam and got the contract award on 30.7.2006 to supply, install and commission of the washing plant. After delivery of the washing plant, the purchaser B.S.M.M.U. conducted inspection of the same and found that the supplied washing plaint was not in accordance with the specifications, and fit for its 2000 bedded hospital. As such, the B.S.M.M.U could not accept the washing plant. Subsequently, the parties to the contract also tried to settle the dispute amicably, but the attempt was unsuccessful. Then complaint-Company referred the matter to the Arbitration. Arbitration Tribunal was formed comprising Mr. Justice A.T.M. Afzal (Chairman), Mr. Justice Md. Awlad Ali (Member) and Barrister Aktar Imam (Member), to resolve the dispute. The claimant-Company filed statement of claim before the Arbitration Tribunal seeking following reliefs:</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;">Contract Price- Tk. 4,11,50,000/-.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Interest on the contract price eat the rate of 17% from 3.4.2007 till the date of award.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Office expenses at the rate of Tk.30,0007-per month with effect from 3.4.2007 till the date of award.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Staff salary at the rate of Tk.1,60,000/-from 3.4.2007 till the date of award.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Time costing at the rate of 1,00,000/-from 3.4.2007 till the date of award.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">For the loss of future business-Tk.10,00,00,000/-.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">For the loss goodwill Tk. 5,00,00,000/-.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Cost of mental agony and sufferings   Tk.3,00,00,000/-.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Legal expenses involving dispute      Tk.30,00,000/-.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Commission   for   extension   of   perfor-mance guarantee paid to the Bank Tk. 10,12,290/-.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4.</strong>         In support of the above claim, it was alleged that after execution of the contract for the supply of the washing plaint, the claimant-Company brought washing machineries at the premises of B.S.M.M.U on 3.1.2007, but the utility connections were provided at the site after about 5.5 months. On 26.9.2007, the contractor-company installed the washing plant and requested the B.S.M.M.U. to issue acceptance certificate   for payment. But the authority did not accept the same and issue acceptance certificate. Then the claimant-company sent a notice dated 22.4.2008 to the B.S.M.M.U invoking clause -39.1 of the General Conditions of Contract (G.C.C) inviting the 2<sup>nd</sup> party    to settle the dispute amicably, and the then Vice-Chancellor of the B.S.M.M.U constituted an Amicable Settlement Committee which could not ultimately succeed in resolving the dispute. Then the Syndicate of the B.S.M.M.U. in its 28 meetings on 26.6.2008, discussed the proposal for amicable settlement brining a supplementary agenda and decided to accept the washing   plant   subject   to   the   certain   conditions.   The claimant-company readily agreed to fulfill those conditions. A tripartite meeting of the Central Receiving Committee, Sub-Committee and Amicable Settlement Committee was held at last on 15.7.2008,  and  the Central Receiving Committee  took  3 weeks  time. But subsequently, the Registrar of the B.S.M.M.U. refused   to   accept   all machineries of the washing plant and requested the claimant-Company to replace certain new machineries, which according to the first party (Company) does not cover by the terms and conditions of the contract. Since the amicable settlement failed inspite of decision of the Syndicate of B.S.M.M.U, the claimant-company preferred to go to the Arbitration under Clause -39 (2) of the section 3 of the Genejal Conditions of Contract (G.C.C).<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>         The B.S.M.M.U. as the second party to the Arbitration submitted a defence setting up a counter claim against the first party, which may be summarized as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify;">      <br/>            Syndicate of the B.S.M.M.U. is the highest body of the public institution dealing with the policy matter regarding management and operation. On 9.10,2004. Mr. Mohammad Shahiduzzaman, the then Member of Parliament (M.P) of the ruling party, was nominated as a Syndicate member of the B.S.M.M.U by the Speaker. He was also Managing Director of the claimant -company at the relevant time. Due to his undue influence, office of the Vice Chancellor initiated a proposal to purchase Hospital Grade Laundry System for 2000 bed facilities on 31.8.2005 and within a short period of 4 days, a tender was published in the daily newspaper 'Dinkal', although the University and Hospital of the B.S.M.M.U had separate committees for their own management. On 4.9.2005, the Chairman of the Central Purchase Committee of B.S.M.M.U. floated tender for procurement of Hospital Grade Laundry System with 2000 bed facilities.  In   response to the   invitation,   5 companies including the Companies of the first party submitted tender on 12.11.2005,   though the claimant-company did not have requisite experience and qualification to participate in the tender. He was also made responsive at the first stage tender. That the company had business in manufacturing and supplying cartons. Mr. Moham-mad Shahiduzzam, Managing Director of the said company, actively participated in the procurement  process as a tenderer and  Syndicate   Member of B.S.M.M.U as well.   Due to his influence upon the Technical Evaluation Committee (T.E.C.), the claimant-Company was chosen as a response   bidder. On 12.7.2006, the claimant-Company and  another tenderer namely,  Asim  Construction  were invited to participate in the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage tender on the basis of specification of goods to be supplied by them as per their quotation in the first stage   tender. In the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage tender, only the   financial   specification   use   to   be   considered according to the two stage tendering method under the regulation 39 of the Public Procurement Regulation (P.P.R.) 2003. That there was no scope to change the earlier technical specification without consent of the B.S.M.M.U. But the claimant-Company subsequ-ently deviated from the specification of goods given   in the first stage tender in a fraudulent manner. However, the claimant-Company was ultimately awarded the contract on the basis technical  specification   mentioned in the first stage tender and corresponding quoted price of the    2<sup>nd</sup> stage tender by notification of award dated 30.7.2006. The B.S.M.M.U. was under a mistaken belief that the load bearing capacity of the Extractors would be sufficient to  serve the purpose of running the Laundry System, one shift per day for 6   hours and 5 days a week as per international standard.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>6.</strong>             The Washing Plant arrived at the premises of the B.S.M.M.U. on 3.4.2007, and after holding the inspection and tests by the Sub-Committee and BUET experts and their 2 reports dated 9.12.2007 and 27.11.2007, it transpired that the supplied Washing Plant was not fit and suitable to meet the requirement of B.S.M.M.U. Report of the Mechanical Engineering Department, BUET, submitted in the month June, 2008, shows that the supplied Washing Plant   was inadequate (63% deficit) for washing 2000 bed hospital facilities. The claimant-company did not supply Extractors and other machineries as per specifications of the tender documents submitted   at the first stage tender. Under the General Conditions of Contract, the purchaser may reject any goods or any part thereof if it fails to pass any test or do not conform with the specifications. That the claimant-company failed to supply goods in accordance with the first stage tender, within time   of contract i.e. 180 days fror 21.8.2006. So, the 2<sup>nd</sup> party of B.S.M.M.U. prayed for dismissal of   the first party's claim and also for an Award of Tk. 4,11,15,0007- as liquidated damages.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>             The claimant-Company or examined one witness (C.W.I) while the 2<sup>nd</sup> party produced 2 witnesses, Registrar of B.S.M.M.U and Dr. Mohammad Ali an expert from BUET, who deposed on the 4 member experts' opinion prepared by the Mechanical Engineering Department of BUET in June, 2008 (Exhibit-E).<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>             After hearing the parties, the Tribunal passed the Arbitral Award dated 21.6.2009, which was unanimous except the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Awlad Ali in respect of awarding interest against the 2<sup>nd</sup> party B.S.M.M.U in the said award. The Tribunal directed the 2<sup>nd </sup>party-B.S.M.M.U. to complete acceptance of the Washing Plant and make payment of contract money along with other benefits in the following manner:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"(1) The parties are bound by the decision of the Syndicate taken under supplementary agenda no. 11 dated 26.6.2008(Vide P.B. part -l, page 76, Exhibit-31), subject to the following modifications of the condition mentioned therein:<br/>a) The performance guarantee is extended for further one year from 15.07.2009;<br/>b) The warranty for the supplied machineries is extended for further two years from 15.07.2009;<br/>c) The parties are directed to complete the acceptance of the Washing Plant by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Party and the payment of the contract money (Taka4,11,50,000.00(BD)to the Party within 30 days from date of the Award;<br/>(d) All other conditions remain.<br/>2. The 1<sup>st</sup> party shall be paid an interest at the rate of 9%    per    annum    on    the    aforesaid    amount    from 14.08.2008 (date of cause of action) (vide PB Part-1., page 91 Exhibit -38) till the date of payment.<br/>3. The 2<sup>nd </sup>Party- Purchaser shall pay costs of this arbitration proceeding to the 1<sup>st</sup> party supplier which we assess at TK. 15,00,000.00( Taka fifteen lac).<br/>4. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Party - Purchaser shall pay to the 1<sup>st</sup> Party -Supplier in terms of clauses 2 and 3 above within not later than 60(sixty) days from the date of the Award."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>9.</strong>             Against the aforesaid Award dated 21.6.2009 passed by   the   Arbitral   Tribunal,   the   2<sup>nd</sup>   party (B.S.M.M.U.) preferred an application under section 42 of the Arbitration Act, 2001 for setting aside the Award, which was registered as Arbitration Misc. Case no. 543 of 2009 in the Court of the learned District Judge, Dhaka. On transfer to the Court of Additional District Judge, it was heard on 17.11.2009 and judgment was delivered on 1.12.2009 setting aside the Award mainly on the ground that the Award was made in violation of section 43(1) (a)(IV) and 43(1) (b)(II) of the Arbitration Act, 2001.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>          Being aggrieved, the First party-(supplier company preferred this appeal under section 48 of the Arbitrator Act, 2001  for setting  the  aforesaid   judgment   dated 1.12.2009 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Court no.2, Dhaka and restoration of the Award.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>          Mr. Abdul Quayum, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant, submits that the contract was finally awarded after proper evaluation of 2<sup>nd</sup> stage tender documents  both in respect of technical as well as financial specification  after the  first party was  found  responsive tender. The  Maisha Corporation (Pvt.) Ltd. (the first party) also  supplied the machineries of the  Washing Plant  in accordance with such specifications as furnished earlier, and the technical Committee comprising two  experts  from BUET also found that the machineries were installed in accordance with the offer. In fact, an amicable settlement to the dispute was reached, which was also approved by the Syndicate of B.S.M.M.U. But unfortunately it was violated by the Central Purchase Committee   of B.S.M.M.U. vide a letter   dated    14.8.2008.   The   learned   Advocate   further submits that it is not a proper interpretation of law that the Arbitral Tribunal had no jurisdiction to take up such a settlement decision of the highest body of the Institution into account as  the said decision of the Syndicate   is very much   related to the same dispute under reference to the Arbitrator. It is also submitted that the Court below has committed mistake in holding that the Arbitral award is liable to be rejected under section 43(l)-(a)(IV) and section 43(l)(b)(II)  of the  Arbitration  Act, 2001. The learned Advocate has also made submission in support of the Award assailing the impugned judgment. It is submitted that the price quoted against the aforesaid machineries in the 2<sup>nd </sup>stage tender was accepted and notification of Award was issued after  modification   and thereafter deed of contract was executed. According to the said contract, the claimant company supplied these machineries on the basis of the 2<sup>nd </sup>stage tender. Now the purchaser-B.S.M.M.U cannot ask for replace-ment of 3 machineries for which no price was quoted by the Company. So the claimant-company cannot be compelled to supply those new goods on the basis of first stage tender. It is further contended that the Syndicate of the B.S.M.M.U passed an order giving effect to the amicable settlement reached in between the parties, with some modifications. That the Tribunal committed no illegality directing parties to abide by the decision of the Syndicate. It is further contended that the work load of the Extractors was sufficiently explained by the claimant-Company in response to the query, and machineries were supplied in accordance with the said additional document which is part of the contract. So, the claimant-Company did not violate any part of the contract and non-acceptance of the supplied goods was illegal and arbitrary act of the 2<sup>nd</sup> party( B.S.M.M.U). With the above submissions, the learned Advocate has prayed for restoration of the Award on setting aside the impugned judgment.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>          Mr. Mahbubey Alam, learned Attorney General and Mr. Tanjib-ul Alam, learned Advocate have appeared on behalf the respondent B.S.M.M.U. and both of them have made submissions in the following manner:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>According to their submissions, the Arbitral Award patently illegal, capricious and  contrary to the settled fundamental principal of law as the Tribunal has directed both the parties to abide by the decision of the Syndicate. The B.S.M.M.U. is also directed to accept the Washing Plant against willingness of the purchaser and decision of the Central Purchase Committee, which is authorized body in this respect. The purchaser has also been given direction to pay the contract money within 30 days. Those directions impliedly amount to compelling performance of contract specifically (here decision of the Syndicate), though an Arbitration Tribunal has no jurisdiction to exercise such a power of the Civil Court under the Specific Relief Act. Moreover, compensation for damages in terms of money is an adequate relief for non-performance of such a contract under section 21 A of the Specific Relief Act. It is argued that amicable settlement was  not  reached  due  to  non-acceptance   of  the   proposal   by   the   Central Purchase Committee. As such, it cannot be treated as a contract to be specifically enforced. Moreover, the B.S.M. M.U. in no circumstances be compelled to accept the machineries of the plant,   which do not satisfy the actual requirement and falls short of specification.  It is submitted that the tribunal has utterly failed to consider that the purchaser can lawfully reject any goods or any part thereof under the General Conditions of Contract, if fails to pass any test, or do not conform with specification of goods to be supplied.   Since the appellant- contractor failed on both the grounds, the Award suffers from the material misconduct by ignoring the 4-   members'   BUET   Expert   report,   and   it   cannot   be sustainable.   The   Arbitration   Tribunal   has   misconstrued Clause 39.1 of the General Conditions of Contract, which merely provides opportunity of the purchaser and supplier to settle up all disputes amicably, failing which, the parties are free to take the matter before the Arbitral Tribunal. There cannot be any binding effect of the proposed negotiation at the amicable settlement attempt, but the Arbitral Tribunal has made the same binding on the parties. It is contended that while consecutive meetings of the Amicable Settlemet Committee were going on and no settlement could be reached, the unilateral settlement proposal of Maish Corporation (Pvt.) Ltd was taken up by the Syndicate and decision was given arbitrarily in a very unusual manner which is a sign of nepotism and favoritism. Next it is contended that two stage tender system as provided under the Regulation 39 of the Public Procurement Regulation 2003, the supplier cannot change unilaterally the technical specifications given in the first stage tender without minutes of tender adjustment. But the claimant-company did not supply machineries in accordance with the specification:-furnished at the first stage tender. That the Laundry System Machineries   agreed   to   be   supplied   by   the   appellant-company were not in conformity with the first stage tender and supplied goods were not fit for the purpose of running 2000 bed hospital for which the tender was invited and the contract was made. That the tribunal has failed to consider that the Managing Director of the Tenderer namely, Maisha Corporation (Pvt.) Ltd. was an interested person in the matter, but he acted in dual capacity as a tenderer and Syndicate member of the purchaser, B.S.M. M.U. So, the agreement for the supply was voidable due to practice of fraud. Expert reports of BUET and experience of the Combined Military Hospital show that the supplied Washing Plant was not fit to serve the purpose of B.S.M.M.U for 2000 bed facilities and maintain its International Standard. So, the purchaser is legally entitled to terminate the contract for default under the provision of General Conditions of Contract. It is submitted further that the learned Additional District Judge has set aside the Award on valid   grounds and as such, the impugned judgment does not call for interference.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>13.</strong>      We have gone through the impugned judgment, the Award passed by the Tribunal and the documents available in the paper books. It appears that the learned Additional District Judge did not consider the main aspect of the case as to whether the claimant company supplied machineries of the Washing Plant in accordance with the terms of the contract, and whether the first party-claimant is entitled to get any compensation for the alleged violation of contract by the 2<sup>nd</sup> party B.S.M.M.U.<br/> <br/><strong>14.      </strong>At the very out set let us deal with the pertinent question whether the claimant-company supplied al machineries of the Washing Plant in accordance with tin contract.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>      The procurement method appears to be of two stage tendering. In the first stage, technical specifications of the goods are invited and the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage tender is related u quotation of prices of those goods.  On the basis of the firsi stage tender specifying quality and other particulars of the goods, the claimant-company  Maisha Corporation (Pvt.) Ltd. and another tenderer Asim Construction  was made responsive and they were accordingly invited to participate in the 2<sup>n</sup>  stage tender, which was considered obviously  for financial specification. So both the tender documents are integral part of the contract according to the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage tendering method. There is no scope for unilateral change in the technical specification in violation of the Regulation 39 of the Public Procurement Act, 2003.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>      Annexure-G appears to be first stage tender document dated 5.11.2005 submitted by the claimant Maisha Corporation (Pvt) Ltd. which shows that the first party claimant agreed to supply 4 Washer Extractors and Flat Iron of Denmark origin, while the Boiler was of U.S.A. But in the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage tender document dated 19.8.2006, country of origin in respect of those components were changed unilaterally. For example the country of origin in respect of 3 Washer Extractors and Flat Iron were shown to be of Sweden in place of Denmark, whereas no country of origin was stated in respect of other items including the Boiler, which was previously shown to be of U.S.A. origin. In Clause-39 of the Public Procurement Regulation Act, 2003 the two stage tendering method has been defined. It shows that first stage tender only invites un-priced technical proposals describing technical performance, quality and other characteristics of the goods, services etc. Obviously it includes the country of origin of the goods previously proposed to be supplied<br/> <br/><strong>17.  </strong>In clause-  39(3)  of  the Public Procuremen Regulation- it is stated:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"In the second stage, a procuring entity shall revise the tender document and stipulate the detailed evaluation criteria for the second stage tenders which shall include cost of ownership during the useful lifetime of the object of the procurement, where applicable, and invite all responsive tenderers from the first stage to submit their priced "best and final" tenders in accordance with the requirements of the second stage tender documents and the individual "Minutes of Tender adjustments" issued to each tenderer.'"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>18.</strong>      With reference words "best and final" used in the above quoted Regulation, the learned Advocate for the appellant has argued that the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage tender being final one,   the   claimant-Company   supplied   machineries in accordance with the said tender documents and did not violate terms of the contract. But we hold the view that such a proposition as to the finality of second tender alone has not    been    contemplated    in    the    Public    Procurement Regulation. It is not acceptable that the words " best and final" are used in that sense. It appears that the words'" best and final" were used in Regulation so far finality of the price of the goods is concerned, and there is no scope to change the quality and other technical specifications which were once accepted by the purchaser, and on the basis of which, the claimant-appellant was selected as responsive tenderer. According to the  Regulation,   quoted  above, 'Minute of Tender Adjustments'  is also necessary to be issued to the tenderes by the purchaser in case of any subsequent modification. But neither the Supplier asked for any alternation in the tender documents in this respect, nor any minutes of tender adjustment was issued for alteration.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>      Referring   to   the   Notification   of   Award   dated 30.7.2006 ( Exhibit-7), the learned Advocate has further argued that it was issued after modification and correction in accordance with Tenderer's clarification to the queries and as such, supply of machineries were made properly accordance with the finally accepted 2<sup>nd</sup> stage tender.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>      It is true that a letter dated 24.6.2006(Exhibit-3) w; issued by the Member Secretary of the Central Purchase Committee asking clarification about (1) offer of Dryer, (II quality of machineries and     (III) actual working loan for 2000 bed Hospital as the first stage tender documents of the claimant-Company did not disclose any  information  on those matters.    Exhibit-4, a reply letter dated 4.7.2006, shows that the claimant-supplier stated about a total load bearing capacity of 132 K/G, and disclosed other particulars on those items. But nothing was disclosed about change of country of origin regarding the three Washer Extractors of Denmark, Boiler of U.S.A., which were clearly slated in the first stage tender documents. No   minute   of   tender adjustment was ever issued by the purchaser as contemplated in Regulation 39(3) of the Public Procurement Regulation 2003.  The specifications of the first stage tender remained valid and it cannot be said to have ever modified or corrected as alleged by  the  learned Advocate   for the appellant.<br/> <br/><strong>21.      </strong>So, we are unable to accept the argument advanced by the learned Advocate for the appellant that the contract was made only on the basis of 2<sup>nd</sup> stage tender quotation. Rather we hold the view that the technical specification as quoted in the first stage tender is necessary to be looked into for acceptance of the Washing Plant. However, it is true that the supplier quoted a consolidated price in the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage tender document against some changed machineries and country of origin in respect of Boiler and of some items was not mentioned. Even then the purchaser issued notification of award and executed the contract. But such an omission or oversight cannot exonerate the first part company from supplying the machineries as agreed by it at the time of submitting first stage tender, which is a part of the contract as per deed of contract itself. So there was no scope for him to change quality of the machineries and country of origin at the second stage tender. It is evident that the learned Arbitrators in their judgment, while passing the Award, could not be satisfied that Washing Extractors supplied by first party were fully suitable, but stated <sup>“</sup>not totally unsuitable."<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>      The B.S.M.M.U. is the only Medical University in our country and such an important public institution should not be subjected to any compromise in purchasing machineries which are found not fully suitable for the purpose.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>      It appears that the contract was executed on the basis of specifications given in the first stage tender and price quotation of the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage tender. Deviation as detected from the first stage tender, on the basis of which the claimant-Company was made responsive, is not legally permissible. Moreover, notification of award dated 30.7.2006 and subsequent contract deed were executed on the basis of both the tenders, which is clear from those documents. If the contract was made on the basis of the 2<sup>nd</sup> tender alone, what is use of the first stage tender? Rather it has been included as valid documents in the deed of contract and notification of award. So it is totally unacceptable to us that the second stage tender is the only basis of the contract.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong>      However, there is no dispute that lenders   were floated, award notification issued and contract agreement was executed for the supply installation and commission of Hospital Grade Laundry System (Washing Plant) for 2000 bedded facilities. Now let it be examined whether the supply of Washing Plant machineries can satisfactorily serve the requirement of the B.S.M.M.U. hospital, which is designed to be built as a modern Hospital of International standard.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong>      It appears that the   Washing Plant   receiving   Sub-Committee comprising of four members submitted a report dated 9.12.2007 stating that it was not fit for operating 2000 bed hospital and that the Boiler was found to be a low quality component in comparison to other components of the plant and incapable of taking required load. However, the BUET expert of the same Sub-Committee submitted a separate report on 27.11.2007 stating that the machineries of the Washing Plant were supplied in accordance with the tender specifications, which is not correct as we have discussed earlier. However, they (experts) were unable to answer to be vital question whether the plant was capable of taking work load for 2000 bed hospital or not. In this respect, those experts suggested to form another independent body to observe the Washing Plant in running. condition for a period of three months.<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong>      Again, the Vice-Chancellor of B.S.M.M.U. requested the Vice-Chancellor of BUET to get the plant examined by the BUET experts and give appropriate comments regarding suitability of the Washing Plant for 2000 bedded hospital facilities. The Vice-Chancellor of B UET referred the same to the Head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, BUET, and 4-member expert teem was formed and they submitted a detailed report in the month of June, 2008,  (Exhibit-E).   Concluding  remarks  made  by  those BUET Experts shows that the supplied Washing Plant was not adequate ( i.e. 63% deficit) for washing 2000 Hospital bedded   facilities with one shift   per day for the specified period of wash as desired by the B.S.M.M.U., if the washing is done in  everyday,  which  is  said  to  be  International standard to be followed.<br/> <br/><strong>27.</strong>      Again on B.S.M.M.U's request, the Combined Military Hospital(C.M.H) has also supplied a detail information about the load bearing capacity of its own Laundry System on 18.3.2009. It shows that the working load of the said Hospital's Washing Extractors is 130 K.G./cycle for 850 bed only. The load bearing capacity of Washing Extractors supplied by the first party-Company was about 132 or 152 K.G./cycle for 2000 bedded hospital, which is not at all fit for the purpose and not in the line with the standard market practice. It appears that the first party quoted for supplying machineries having work load capacity of 132 K.G., which was found on the that the supplied machineries can cover work load of 152 K.Gs. where as there port of the 2 BUET_experts dated 27.11.2007(Exhibit-21) shows that the requirement of the B.S.M.M.U is 621 K.G. if it operates in one shift 5 days for 6 hours. Evaluation report of the Mechanical Engineering Department, BUET (Exhibit-E) also shows that if the standard washing duration is followed, the Extr-actors load bearing capacity becomes inadequate.<br/> <br/><strong>28.</strong>      Thus we find that neither the claimant-Company supplied some of the machineries of the Plant namely: Washer Extractors, Flat Iron and Boiler of Denmark and U.S.A in origin in accordance with its own technical specification  in the first stage tender,  nor the  supplied Washing Plant can meet the full requirement of B.S.M.M.U's 2000 bedded Hospital eeping conformity within international standard as per the report of the experts. When it is apparent that the goods do not correspond to the specifications of the tender and are not also fit for the purpose for which it will be used, the purchaser may reject such goods or any part thereof, if it fails to pass any test or inspection as contemplated under Clause- 31.7 of the General Conditions of Contract (GCC).<br/> <br/><strong>29.</strong>      It appears that when the contract is violated and amicable settlement failed, the B.S.M.M.U issued a letter dated 14.08.2008 on the Managing Director of Maisha Corporation (Pvt) Ltd. asking for replacement of Boiler, Washer Extractors and Flat Iron, and supply those components made in U.S.A and Denmark as per first stage tender documents. Such a letter cannot be treated as unreasonable and malafide. But on getting this letter, the claimant-company referred the matter to the Arbitrators without rectifying the wrong.<br/> <br/><strong>30.</strong>      Admittedly, the Managing Director of the claimant-Company, Mr. Mohammad Shahiduzzaman, being a Member of the Parliament was nominated as a Member o the Syndicate of the B.S.M.M.U. and he was in the said capacity from 9.10.2004 to 28.10.2006. From the date of inviting tender till 22.10.2006, he was found an active Syndicate Member of the B.S.M.M.U and during this tenure, he was also the Managing Director of the claimant Company and actively participated in the process of tender including proper evaluation, awarding contract etc. There is serious allegation that his Company having no technical and financial qualification to supply the Washing Plant unduly influenced the then authority of the B.S.M.M.U. through him to get tender award in its favor and the whole process of awarding the tender in favor of his Company demonstrate nepotism and favoritism as he was a very influential in the decision making process at the relevant time. It appears that Mr. Mohammad Shahiduzzaman did not make any declaration as to his relationship with the tenderer but participated  both  as a tenderer as well as Syndicate Member. This highly unethical and contrary to the  Regulations of Public Procurement Act, 2003.  The allegation of undue influence by exerting his position as a Syndicate Member and Member of Parliament, cannot be brushed aside. Because, the claimant-company obtained work order without mentioning the country of origin against the some items in the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage tender, and in spite of the fact that load bearing specification as stated in the supplementary tender document was not sufficient for B.S.M.M.U's requirement for 2000 bed hospital and below the standard market practice as evident from the experts<sup>’ </sup>opinion, the claimant-Company got the supply award. Unilateral change in the 2<sup>n</sup> stage tender document does not also quality him to get the contract award, but the then authority of B.S.M.M.U. overlooked all these vital defects and disqualifications. Those speak volume about malafidness and fraudulent practice, which can vitiate the whole process rendering the contract voidable.<br/> <br/><strong>31.</strong>      This respect, Mr.  Mahbubey Alam, the learned Attorney General, has brought to our notice that the office note was initiated on 31.8.2005, signed by the Vice-Chancellor on 1.9.2005 (Exhibit-B) and the tender notice was published in the Daily Dinkal on 4.9.2005 and the tender was submitted on 5.11.2005 (Annexure-G).The whole process was done very hurriedly. Moreover, when the claimant M.P. was nominated as Member of the Syndicate to see welfare of the B.S.M.M.U., he was not supposed to engage himself in business in the said public institution. In this respect, the learned Attorney General has referred to the section 1(3.1) of the General Conditions of Contract.<br/> <br/><strong>32.</strong>      Apart from the merit regarding the contractual obligations, it transpires from the impugned judgment that the Arbitral Award has been set-aside only on the ground that the Tribunal passed the Award to enforce the terms of alleged amicable settlement as per decision of the Syndicate of the B.S.M.M.U. thought the dispute was not amicably settled and it was not at all the subject matter of the Tribunal to implement such a decision. So the Award to enforce a decision of the Syndicate, not being within the scope of arbitration, has clearly violated section 43(l)(a)(IV) of the Arbitration Act, 2001. We do not also find any document to show that any final decision was taken by the Amicable Settlement Committee at any point of time though it was so written in the decision of the Syndicate. Rather it appears that the claimant-company submitted an unilateral proposal for amicable settlement on 22.6.2008, which was taken up by  the  Syndicate  and  decided  to  accept the  same  on 26.6.2008 in the name of amicable settlement. It can be easily understood that if such amicable settlement was reached in between the parties, there was no reason to take the matter before the Syndicate for any further decision. It appears from the record that while the Amicable Settlement Committee had been holding meetings and fixed another date for the 3<sup>rd</sup> meeting, the matter was hurriedly taken before   the   Syndicate   and   the   decision   was   obtained according to the desire of the claimant-Company.<br/> <br/><strong>33.</strong>      Section 43 of the Arbitration Act, 2001 has specifically laid down the grounds for setting aside the Award of the Arbitral Tribunal, which runs as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"(1) An arbitral award may be set aside if-<br/>(a) The party making the application furnishes proof that-<br/>(i) a party to the arbitration agreement was under some incapacity;<br/>(ii) The arbitration agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it;<br/>(iii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable due to some reasonable causes to present his case:<br/>(iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decision on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration;<br/>Provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, only that part of the arbitral award which contains decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration may be set aside;<br/>(v) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, unless such agreement was in conflict with the provisions of this Act, or, in the absence of such agreement, was not in accordance with the provisions of this Act.<br/>(b) the court or the High Court Division, as the case may be, is satisfied that-<br/>(i) the subject matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by the arbitration under the law for the time being in force in Bangladesh;<br/>(ii) the arbitral award is prima face opposed to the law for the time being in force in Bangladesh;<br/>(iii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of Bangladesh or<br/>(iii) the arbitral award is induced or affected by fraud or corruption."<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>34.</strong>      The section 43(l)(a)(iv) clearly provides that if the Award contains decision on matters beyond the scope of the submissions to the Arbitration or it deals with dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of reference, it is liable to be set aside.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>35.</strong>      It appears from the notice dated 9.9.2008 sent by the claimant first party for resolving the dispute by arbitration and application submitted by him before the arbitral Tribunal that since the attempt of amicable settlement had failed, the first party incurred huge loss and injury in respect of money, time, goodwill, mental agony and sufferings in various ways, he is entitled get an award on all those counts.<br/> <br/><strong>36.</strong>      Accordingly, he prayed for contract price, interest, compensation   and   other costs   and   not to   enforce the contract. Neither there is any scope to seek enforcement of any decision of the Syndicate meeting or proposed amicable settlement nor any such subject matter was referred to the Tribunal for implementation. The Tribunal has nothing to do with such a decision of the Syndicate in the arbitration forum. The obligation of the parties to the contract can only be looked into in relation to the damage claimed. But the Arbitration Tribunal appears to have passed the Award in the following manner enforcing the decision of the Syndicate in the line of proposed amicable settlement, which was admittedly failed and has no existence at all.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"(1) The parties are bound by the decision of Syndicate taken under supplementary agenda no. 11 dated 26.6.2008(Vide Paper Book part -1-page 76, Lixhibit-31). Subject to the following modification of the condition mentioned therein:-<br/>a) The performance guarantee is extended for further one year from 15.07.2009;<br/>b) The warranty for the supplied machineries is extended for further two years from 15.07.2009;<br/>c)The parties are directed to complete the acceptance of the Washing Plant by the 2<sup>nd</sup> party and the payment of the contract money (Taka 4,11,50,000.00(BD) to the 1<sup>st</sup> party within 30 days from date of the Award;<br/>(d) All other conditions remain."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>37.</strong>      Moreover 9% yearly interest from 14.8.2008( cause of action) till disposal and cost of Arbitration proceedings amounting to Tk. 15,00,0007- was made payable by the 2<sup>nd </sup>party within 60 days from the date of award.<br/> <br/><strong>38.</strong>      From the above quoted part of the Award it is evident that the tribunal has actually given effect to the decision of the Syndicate which was passed in the line of the proposed amicable settlement, though it was not agreed by administrative authority of the B.S.M.M.U. Rather the 2<sup>nd </sup>party asked for replacement of three components according to the first stage tender by a letter dated 14.8.2008 issued by the Registrar. The letter is reproduced below:<br/> </div><table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td style="height: 29px; width: 111px; text-align: justify;"><strong>Name of item</strong></td><td style="height: 29px; width: 111px; text-align: justify;"><strong>Country of Origin</strong></td><td style="height: 29px; width: 111px; text-align: justify;"><strong>Model</strong></td><td style="height: 29px; width: 111px; text-align: justify;"><strong>Capacity</strong></td><td style="height: 29px; width: 111px; text-align: justify;"><strong>Remarks</strong></td></tr><tr><td style="height: 44px; width: 111px; text-align: justify;">Boiler</td><td style="height: 44px; width: 111px; text-align: justify;">USA</td><td style="height: 44px; width: 111px; text-align: justify;">FULTON</td><td style="height: 44px; width: 111px; text-align: justify;">1 .5 ton/Hr.or  More</td><td style="height: 44px; width: 111px; text-align: justify;">বর্ণনামতে প্রতিস্থাপন করতে হবে।</td></tr><tr><td style="height: 59px; width: 111px; text-align: justify;">Washer extractor</td><td style="height: 59px; width: 111px; text-align: justify;">Denmark</td><td style="height: 59px; width: 111px; text-align: justify;">Electrolux Model :W31100C</td><td style="height: 59px; width: 111px; text-align: justify;">110Kg</td><td style="height: 59px; width: 111px;">বর্ণনামতে নতুনভাবে সরবরাহ ও স্থাপন করতে হবে।</td></tr><tr><td style="height: 45px; width: 111px; text-align: justify;">Flat Iron</td><td style="height: 45px; width: 111px; text-align: justify;">Denmark</td><td style="height: 45px; width: 111px; text-align: justify;">Electrolux Model :CFLEX900</td><td style="height: 45px; width: 111px; text-align: justify;">Roll Dia 800 mm &amp; Speed upto 50m/min</td><td style="height: 45px; width: 111px; text-align: justify;">বর্ণনামতে প্রতিস্থাপন করতে হবে।</td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>39.</strong>      Thus it appears that reasonable ground was given by the B.S.M.M.U. authority for non-acceptance of the Washing Plant, and further opportunity was given to the supplier to replace three components which do not correspond to the machineries as specified by them at the first stage tender. It is further stated that the matter would be sent to the Syndicate again in case of disagreement to the proposal. It may be mentioned here that the Central Purchase Committee of B.S.M.M.U having full lawful authority to accept or refuse to accept the Washing Plant gave decision in the matter. The Central Purchase Committee should not be compelled by any other authority without legal back up. There is nothing to show that the matter was taken to the Syndicate Meeting in an usual official process. Rather when the matter was pending before the Amicable Settlement Committee, it was taken up by the Syndicate by inserting a supplementary agenda in the Meeting. Such an extraneous decision should not be imposed on the assigned Purchase Committee, which is legally responsible to accept or refuse to accept the supplied goods of the contract on valid ground.<br/> <br/><strong>40.</strong>      Even if it is conceded that the B.S.M.M.U. authority committed any wrongful act or omission in awarding the supply work in spite of violation of the terms of first stage tender specification by the claimant-tenderer and illegalities in accepting the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage tender by alteration, the supplier ought to have sold the supplied   Washing Plant first   when it was decided unacceptable and he ought to have set a claim for the remaining loss, adjusting the sale proceeds. The supplier-Company ought to have taken reasonable steps to mitigate the loss consequent upon purchaser's wrong even if any, and then only ask for the remaining loss and damages. But in the instant case, no reasonable step was taken to mitigate the loss. If any such damage or compensation, after adjustment of the sale proceeds of Washing Plant, is necessary to be paid to the supplier, it should fall upon the personal liability of those persons, who had issued notification of award (work order) by accepting the 2<sup>nd </sup>stage tender violating the rules and against the interest of national public institution like the B.S.M.M.U. Neither the B.S.M.M.U. can be compelled to accept the Washing Plant as supplied by the Claimant- Company nor any price of the plant or compensation for any part thereof can be allowed to spend from the Public Fund. It is against the Public Policy meaning thereby that Public Fund cannot be misused by granting such Award. As such, the Award is not legally sustainable.<br/> <br/><strong>41.      </strong>Moreover, it is evident that the Maisha Corporation (Pvt) Ltd. submitted an application before the Tribunal to pass an award for payment contract of price, interest thereon and other monetary compensations on several heads. Neither there was any scope to enforce a decision of the Syndicate by the Tribunal nor any such prayer was made by the first party seeking arbitral award. Evidently the award was passed by the Tribunal to enforce the decision of the Syndicate in the line of amicable settlement proposed by the supplier like a decree of suit for specific performance of Contract. In doing so, the Tribunal appears to have exceeded limit of its lawful authority in passing the award and as such, the Tribunal appears to have violated the provision of section 43(I)(a)(IV) of the Arbitration Tribunal Act. 2001, which is obviously, a cogent ground for setting aside Arbitral Award.<br/> <br/><strong>42.</strong>  It appears from the impugned judgment that the Additional District Judge also invoked section 43(I)(a)(b)(ll) of the Arbitration Act, 2001 in setting aside the Award as there is a legal bar under section 21 (a) of the Specific Relief Act to enforce the contract, for non-performance of which, money is an adequate relief. However, neither it was suit for Specific Performance of Contract nor the Tribunal had any lawful authority to pass an Award for implementing a decision of Syndicate with such directions assuming power of the Civil Court.<br/> <br/><strong>43.</strong>      Having   due   regard   to   the   aforesaid   facts   and circumstances and findings, we hold the view that there is no cogent ground for setting aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the Court below in setting aside the Award.<br/> <br/><strong>44.</strong>      So the First Misc. Appeal fails.<br/> <br/><strong>45.</strong>      In the result, the First Misc. Appeal is dismissed. The impugned judgment and order is maintained. We prefer it make any order as to costs.<br/> <br/>Send down the L.C.Rs. along with a copy of the judgment to the Court below immediately.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

No. জেঃপ্রঃ/পাব/রাজস্ব/ভিপি মিসকেস নং ০৩(পাব)/৮৬-৮৭/০৯-১৩৯৬, dated 22.6.2009 issued by the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Pabna (the Respo-ndent No. 3) directing the petitioner to hand over possession of the Scheduled Land (Annexure –‘A’) shall not be declared to have been issued without lawful authority and is of no legal effect and further why the Respondents shall not be directed to renew the lease of the Scheduled Land in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Memo. Dated 6.8.1991 (Annexure–‘E’) by accepting the outstan-ding rent payable by the petitioner from the year 1416 B.S.<br/> <br/><strong>3.      </strong>The writ petition No.6766 of 2011 has been filed by way of Public Interest Litigation (PIL). In that petition Rule Nisi was issued calling upon the respondents to show cause as to why the inaction of the respondents to take appropriate legal steps against the land grabbers of “Shuchitra Sen’s paternal house in Pabna Sadar should not be declared illegal and without lawful authority and a direction should not be given upon the respondents to ensure  protection of the house of their all time famous icon and legendary actress of the sub-continent, Shuchitra Sen and why they shall not be directed to perform their duty vested upon them under the Constitution of Bangladesh.<br/> <br/><strong>4.      </strong>The relevant facts of writ Petition No. 4608 of 2009, in short, are that  on 11<sup>th</sup> December, 1995, Moulana Md. Abdus Subhan created a trust by executing a Deed  of trust for the purpose of establishing and running schools, colleges, madrasahs  and medical centres. The management of the affairs of the Trust has been vested in a Board of Trustees comprising of 9 members. In 1983, the Board of Trustees of the Trust established Imam Gazzali Institute as an educational institution.  On the basis of the prayer, the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Pabna granted  year to year lease of the Scheduled land  of the impugned notice  in favour of the petitioner commencing from 1<sup>st</sup> Paush, 1393 B.S on condition that an application had to be made for renewal of the lease at the beginning of the year following the expiry of the lease. On 2<sup>nd</sup> June, 1990, the Deputy Director, Primary Education, Rajshahi after conducting necessary enquiries granted registration to the petitioner for setting up a private school Thereafter, the petitioner, as Principal of the Imam Gazzali Institute, started a primary school. By a Memo dated 6<sup>th</sup> August, 1991 the Ministry of Land informed the petitioner that there is no provision  for permanent settlement of vested properties so the lease of the scheduled land would be renewed every year until the Government takes final decision with regard to the settlement of vested properties. Thereafter, the respondents had renewed the lease of the scheduled land upon receipt of advance rent at the beginning of each year following the expiry of the lease in accordance with Clauses 4 and 5 of the lease deed. The school buildings of the institute located on the scheduled land were in a dilapidated condition. The petitioner incurred several lacs of Taka for repairing and rebuilding the roof of the school building. On 25.05.1992, the Ministry of Land permitted the petitioner to repair the school building with approval of the local administration. The respondent Nos. 2 and 3 received rent from 1393 B.S. to 1415 B.S. regularly. On 20.04.2009, the petitioner filed application for renewal of lease of the scheduled land for the year 1416-1417 B.S. On 20.04.2009, the petitioner requested  the A.D.C (Rev) to accept the  lease-money for the year 1416-1417 B.S. Meanwhile, the mpugn-ned notice has been issued directing the petitioner to hand over possession of the disputed property. The petitioner, by another letter dated 10<sup>th</sup> June, 2009 again requested the Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 to accept the rent for the year 1416-1417 B.S but they did not accept the same. Thereafter,  the respondent No. 3 issued the impugned order on 22<sup>nd</sup> of June, 2009 informing the petitioner that a Museum is going to be constructed on the scheduled land and accordingly directed the petitioner to hand over possession of the said land. Challenging the letter dated 22.06.2009 (Annexure-A) the petitioner moved this Court under Article 102 read with Article 44 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and obtained the instant rule.<br/> <br/><strong>5.      </strong>The respondent No. 4 filed affidavit in opposition contending that the land measuring .2125 acres appertaining to S.A. Khatian No. 99, plot no. 587 of Mouza Gopalpur and the structures situated  thereon (referred as scheduled property) originally  belonged to Karunamoyee Das Gupta. S.A. record of right was prepared in his name. Karunamoyee  Das Gupta left the then East Pakistan before 1960 for India. The Government made requisition of the said property in H.R.S. Case No. 4 of 1960 (Pab) and let out the same to their employees. Thereafter, the said property was enlisted as vested property. R.S. record of right was prepared in the name of Korunamoyee Das Gupta. The respondent No. 3 leased out the said property to the petitioner as yearly lease in V.P. Misc. Case No. 3 (Pab) of 1986-87. Thereafter, the petitioner Imam Gazzali Institute took permanent lease of 1.29 acres of land from plot No. 801 of Mouza Dakkhin Raghobpur, Pabna and constructed their four storied building thereon and started to run the function of their institution in the name of “Imam Gazzali School and College”. As per provision of new law relating to Vested Property the lease of the petitioner has been cancelled on 11.04.2001.  The law does not provide any provision allowing any one to get lease of two or more pieces of land at a time. Suchitra Sen, daughter of Karunamoyee Das Gupta, a famous actress of the sub-continent was born in the disputed premises. The Government has decided to establish “Suchitra Sen Memorial Complex” in her birth place to protect and preserve her memory. Accordingly, the Deputy Commissioner, Pabna issued the notice to vacate the premises.<br/> <br/><strong>6.      </strong>In writ petition No. 6766 of 2011 it has been, inter alia, stated that the petitioner is an organization. Many cases by way of public interest litigations have been filed by them. A report had been published in ‘The Daily Sokaler Khabor’ on 13.07.2011 that paternal house of Suchitra Sen has been grabbed by some people taking support from law enforcing agencies. The local people disclosed that Suchitra Sen, with her family, left for Kolkata at the time of partition of India. The said house was listed as vested property. In 1987, Jamat-e-Islam, organized education center using unjust force, took lease of the said house and the adjacent land. The police failed to take steps against those land grabbers. The District Administr-ation had issued a notice to them to vacate the premises. Imam Gazzali Institute has rebuilt the house and constructed few shops for letting out the same for business purpose. It is the constitutional duty of the respondents to preserve the birth place of Suchitra Sen and structure thereon considering her contributions in the cultural arena.<br/> <br/><strong>7.      </strong>The added respondent No. 7 filed affidavit-in-opposition in writ petition No. 6766 of 2011. In fact, this added respondent No. 7 in his affidavit-in-opposition reiterated his case as made out in writ petition No. 4608 of 2009 and further stated that the land appertaining to D.S. Khatian No. 88 and plot No. 587 jointly owned by (1) Prasanna Biswas (2) Uma Prasanna Biswas  and (3) Ananda Prasanna Biswas. The said land was never listed as a ‘natural heritage’ site by the Ministry of Culture and there is no record with either the Ministry of Culture or the Ministry of Land to prove that  the scheduled  land was the paternal  property  of Suchitra Sen. There is no public interest involved  in dispossessing  the respondent No. 7 from the scheduled land, which is a vested property and had been leased out to the respondent No. 7. This writ petition has been  filed suppressing  material facts and for the malafide purpose for harassing  the respondent No. 7 who has  been enjoying lawful possession in the same.<br/> <br/><strong>8.      </strong>Mr. Abdur Razzaq, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner, at the out set submits that at the time of passing the impugned order of eviction the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Pabna, neither followed the connected provisions of law and circular relating to the Vested and Non-resident Property nor the relevant provisions of the Government and Local Authority Lands and Buildings (Recovery of Possession) Ordinance, 1970 (East Pakistan Ordinance No.24 of 1970).  He submits that it was the duty of the respondents to issue a show cause notice giving  the petitioner an opportunity  of being heard before passing the order of eviction. He submits that earlier the Government in writing assured that the disputed property would be leased out to the petitioner on yearly basis until adoption of the law of permanent settlement. Accordingly, the petitioner spent huge money to repair and re-construct the structure thereon legitimately expecting that the authority will lease out the disputed property to the petitioner permanently. The respondents are barred by the principles of stoppels in taking any steps to evict the petitioner from the premises after issuing Annexure–E. He submits that the principles of natural justice has also been violated by giving the order of eviction without issuing any opportunity of the petitioner of being heard. Mr. Razzaq seriously attacks on the maintainability of the writ petition No. 6766 of 2011 saying that the said rule has been obtained by suppressing the material facts. He submits that this petitioner took over possession of the disputed property exhausting the process of law and has possessed the same depositing lease money but the petitioner of the writ petition No. 6766 of 2011 has termed the petitioner as “land graver” which is unfortunate. The disputed property has been using as educational institution so the language as used addressing the institution is unacceptable and such type of wording in the petition should be discouraged.<br/> <br/><strong>9.      </strong>The learned Attorney General, appearing for the respondents in Writ Petition No. 4608 of 2009, submits that the disputed property is the vested and non-resident property. The original owner of the said property  was Karunamayee Das Gupta, father  of Suchitra Sen, famous artist in the cultural arena of the sub-continent. Related vested property laws allowed the Government to manage, control, administer and dispose the vested properties. After taking decision to protect and preserve the memory of Suchitra Sen, the Government issued the impugned notice to the petitioner to vacate the premises stating that the Government has taken decision to establish “Suchitra Sen Smriti Sangrashala” in her birth place. He submits that after expiry of the period of lease it was the duty of the petitioner to vacate the possession of the premises. At present the petitioner has become nauthorized occupant in the premises and he is not entitled to get any protection to remain in possession from this Court. He submits that at the time of allowing the petitioner to repair the building the Government imposed a condition that the petitioner shall not acquire any right in the property for reasons of payment of repairing cost. He submits that since the “Imam Gazzali Institute” has already constructed their own four storied building in a different place, allotted by the Government, the eviction will not affect the future of the students of the said Institution. The learned Attorney General submits that second writ petition is that, in fact, the second petition is redundant in view of the fact that the Government has already taken decision to establish “Suchitra Sen  Smriti Sangrahashala” in the property in question and in order to implement  the decision, the impugned notice  for eviction has been issued. After so eviction of the petitioner of writ petition No. 4608 of 2009, the Government shall take other positive steps for establishment of the ‘Suchitra Sen Smriti Sangraha-shala’.<br/> <br/><strong>10.    </strong>Mr. Manzill Murshid, the learned Advocate for the petitioner  of Writ Petition No. 6766 of 2011 submits that this writ petition has been filed by way of Public Interest Litigation for a direction upon the Government to preserve  and protect the birth place of great actress Suchitra Sen narrating some facts gathered  from the newspaper and the petitioner was not aware  about the facts of leasing out the property  to Imam Gazzali Institute and pendency of the Rule and order of stay  in Writ Petition No. 4608 of 2009 so he has failed to bring the said story  in petition. He submits  that Suchitra Sen is a symbol of pride  of our cultural arena. It is the constitutional duty of Government to preserve and protect her birth place.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>    We have heard the learned Advocates for the petitioners and the learned Attorney General for the Government, peruse the writ petition, affidavit-in-opposition and other materials on record.<br/> <br/><strong>12.    </strong>The petitioner of Writ Petition No. 4608 of 2009 took lease of the disputed property in V.P. Misc. Case No. 3(Pab)/86-87 which indicates that the said V.P. Case was started sometimes in 1986-87. There is nothing before us whether the scheduled land was enlisted as enemy property before 1969 and thereafter vested and non-resident property legally or not. Since both the parties admitted that the disputed property is the vested and non-resident property, we are of the view that the process of management, administration and disposal of the same should be regulated by the laws and circulars relating to Vested and Non-resident Property.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>    The submission of Mr. Razzaq that the authority did not comply the provision of Government and Local Authority Land and Buildings (Recovery of Possession) Ordinance, 1970 at the time of issuance of impugned notice does not deserve any consideration in view of the admission of the parties concerned that the scheduled property is vested property.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>    Another aspect was raised in affidavit-in-opposition filed by added respondent No. 7 of W.P. No. 6766 of 2011, that original owners of the scheduled property were Prassanya Biswas, Uma Prssanaya Biswas and Annada  Prassanya Biswas not Karunamayee Das Gupta, father of Shuchitra Sen. But in 2009 when he filed W.P. 4608 of 2009 did not state anything   regarding  the ownership of the  schedule property. A lease is not legally entitled to make any dispute regarding the title of the lease hold property against the lessor before leaving the possession of the same as lease.<br/> <br/><strong>15.    </strong>In exercise of power conferred by clause –(1) of  Article 30 of the Constitution of Pakistan, the President of Pakistan proclaimed Emergency on 06.09.1965. On that day, the Defence of Pakistan Ordinance was promulgated in exercise of powers under clause (4) of Article 30 read with clause (2) of Article 31 of the Constitution to meet emergency. On the same day, i.e., on 06.09.1965 the Central Government of Pakistan, in exercise of power vested under section 3 of the Defence of Pakistan   Ordinance, 1965, issued the Defence of Pakistan Rules. The power conferred in sub-rule (1) of Rule 182.of the Defence of Pakistan Rules, the then Governor  of East Pakistan passed an Order in the name of East Pakistan Enemy Property (Land and Buildings) Administration and Disposal  Order, 1966. Clause-4 of the said order provided the provisions of the administration and disposal of enemy property which runs as follows :-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“4. Disposal of Property: (1) Except as provided in sub-paragraph (2) the custodian shall not transfer or otherwise dispose of any enemy property vested in him without the previous approval of the Provincial Government.<br/>    (2)The custodian may grant lease of or let out, any such enemy property for a period not exceeding one year at a time.<br/>    (3) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any agreement, a person to whom any enemy property is leased or let out under sub-paragraph (2) shall not acquire any right of occupancy in such property and shall not be entitled to hold over after the expiry of the period of lease.<br/>    (4) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for time being in force or in any agreement, the lessee or tenant in respect of any enemy property leased or let out under sub-paragraph (2) shall be liable to be evicted without notice from such property at the expiry of the term of the lease.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>16.    </strong>On revocation of the Defence of Pakistan Ordinance, the Enemy Property (Continuance of Emergency) Ordinance, 1969 was promulgated on 16.02.1969 wherein it was provided that the provisions of Defence of Pakistan Rules, mentioned in first column of the schedule to the Ordinance, shall continue in force and shall have effect subject to the modification specified in the second column thereof. The purpose of the Ordinance  was that notwithstanding the  withdrawal  of Emergency, and the Defence of Pakistan Ordinance ceasing to have effect,  certain provisions of the Defence of Pakistan Rules made under the said Ordinance were sought  to be continued relating to control of trading with enemy and control of firms and vesting and administration of property belonging to them.<br/> <br/><strong>17.    </strong>Subsequent position of the connected laws had been discussed in the case of M/S. Dulichand Omraolal Vs. Bangladesh, 33 DLR (AD) 30, Their Lordships of the Appellate Division , inter alia, observed  in the said case,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The Ordinance IV of 1974 the Enemy Property (Continuance of Emergency Provisions)(Repeal) Ordinance, 1974, which repealed the Enemy Property  (Continuance of Emergency Provisions) Ordinance I of 1969 and provided, inter alia, that all enemy property vested in the Custodian of Enemy Property appointed under the previsions of the Defence of Pakistan Rules continued in force by the said Ordinance shall vest in the Government, meaning Government of Bangladesh. There was another Ordinance No. V of 1974. The Vested and Non-Resident Property (Administration) Ordinance 1974, which provided for the management and control of the vested and non-resident properties in the manner set out in the Ordinance. These Ordinances were replaced by Act XLV of 1974, Enemy Property (Continuance of Emergency Provision) (Repeal) Act, 1974, and Act No. XLVI of 1974 the Vested and Non-Resident Property (Administration) Act, 1974. There had been two subsequent enactments, namely Ordinance XCII of 1976, the Vested and Non-Resident Property (Administration) (Repeal) Ordinance, 1976 which repealed the Vested and Non-Resident Property (Administration) Act, 1974 followed by Ordinance XCIII of 1976 the Enemy Property (Continuance of Emergency Provision) (Repeal) (Administration) Ordinance, 1976, which has amended  Section (3) of Act XLV of 1974 by providing  that the properties which had vested in the Government, the right of administration, control, management and disposal of by transfer or otherwise be conferred on the government or of such officer or authority as the Government may direct.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>18.</strong>       In the case of Mofazzal Hossain and another Vs. Bangladesh, reported in 43 DLR (AD) 137, it has been observed by the Appellate Division ,  “The Enemy Property  (Continuance of Emergency Provision) (Repeal) Act, 1974 (Act XLV of 1974) on being amended by  the Enemy Property (Continuance of Emergency Provisions) (Repeal) (Amendment) Ordinance, 1976 (Ordinance No. XCIII of 1976) by the relevant clause  of section 3 provides that all enemy property vested in the custodian of the enemy property appointed under the provisions of the Reference of Pakistan Rules and continued in force by the Ordinance  ( 1 of 1969) shall vest in the Government and shall be administered, controlled, managed and disposed of by transfer or otherwise  by the Government or by such officer or authority as the Government may direct.  Circular dated 23<sup>rd</sup> May, 1977 of the Ministry of Land Administration and Land Reforms Division containing instruction for administration, management and disposal of vested property by clause 4(1), provides that ADC (Rev) may, with the previous approval of the Government, transfer or otherwise dispose of any vested property either by himself or through the Sub-divisional officer in whose jurisdiction the property is situated.”<br/> <br/><strong>19.   </strong>The relevant portions of circular  of the Government dated  23.5.1977 run as follows :-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong>4</strong>(1) The Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) may, with the previous approval of the Government, transfer or otherwise dispose of any vested property either by himself or through the Sub-divisional Officer in whose jurisdiction the property is situated.<br/>(2)  No such approval shall be necessary for granting lease of or letting out any such property for a period not exceeding one year at a time.<br/><strong>5.</strong> A person to whom any vested property  is leased out  or let out  under paragraph 4(2) shall not acquire  any right of occupancy in such property and shall not be entitled  to hold on after the expiry of the period of lease.<br/><strong>6. </strong>The lessee or tenant in respect of any vested property shall be liable to be evicted from the said property at the expiry of the period of lease.<br/>Clause 7: If any vested property is found in unlawful possession of any person, Sub-Divisional Officer under whose jurisdiction the said property is situated, shall issue notice on the person in unlawful possession to show cause within period not exceeding 7(seven) days as to why he will not be evicted therefrom and after giving the person an opportunity of being heard may enforce surrender of such property. For this purpose the Sub-Divisional Officer may use or goes to be used such force as may be necessary.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>20.</strong>    Mr. Razzaq relying upon Clause-7 of the Circular submits that there is specific provision that seven days’ notice is to be served upon the incumbent giving an opportunity of being heard. He submits that the Circular is binding upon the maker. Issuing the impugned notice of eviction the respondents violated their own Circular which is the guiding principle to deal with the administration of Vested and Non-resident Property. Mr. Razzaq further submits that the principle of natural justice also demands that before receiving an order of eviction the person who has been possessing the property for about 23 years is entitled to get notice. In this regard Mr. Razzaq relied upon the case of M/S. Delta Constructions Ltd. Vs. Chairman, 2<sup>nd</sup> Labour Court and another, reported in 28 DLR 365. In the cited case it was held,<br/>      “The said circular is obviously on administrative  act and cannot said to have the force of a piece of legislation. Nevertheless, the binding nature of this circular cannot be ignored, ......”<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>    Mr. Razzaq also relied on the case of Chairman, Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Jessore. Vs. Amir Hossain and another, reported in 56 DLR (AD) 24. In the cited case their Lordships of the Appellate Division  have observed,  “It is now a settled principle that even where provision for show cause notice and affording opportunity of personal hearing are not available, the principle of natural justice shall be applied unless it is specifically barred.”<br/> <br/><strong>22.    </strong>Mr. Mahbubey Alam, the learned Attorney General relied upon the Circular itself and submits that Clauses- 5 and 6 are applicable for the lessee who after getting lease was inducted into the possession and after expiry of the period of lease he became unauthorized  occupant and Clause – 5 clearly provides that after expiry of period of lease the lessee shall not be entitled to hold the possession of the property and liable to be evicted. He submits that Clause-7 is applicable for the person who is in unlawful possession, not for the lessee who became unauthorized occupant after the expiry of the period of lease. He submits that the words “unlawful possession of any person” have been used in clause-7 meaningfully for making deference with the former leasee and unauthorized occupant.  He submits that the Circular has got no legal force and on the basis of Circular an administrative order cannot be declared unlawful.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong> Clause- 4(4) of the East Pakistan Enemy Property (land and Buildings) Administration Order 1966 started with a non-obstante clause and specifically provided that lessee after expiry of the period lease shall liable to be evicted without any notice but in circular dated 23.5.1977 no such provision has been provided. Clause No.4(4)  of Order clearly provided that the same is applicable for the “lessee” or “tenant” in respect of  property leased out under sub-clause (2) of Clause 4 of the Order but Clause-7 of the Circular dated 23.5.1977 is applicable for “any person” who is found in “unlawful possession” in the vested property. The “words” and “language” used in those two provisions have made a clear difference between them. Those were made objectively. In view of apparent difference we find substance in the submission of the learned Attorney General. <br/> <br/><strong>24.    </strong>Clauses 5 and 6 of the Circular dated 23.5.1977 provided that after expiry of period of lease the lessee shall become unauthorized occupant. In Clause 5 it has been provided that the person shall not acquire  any right of occupancy after getting lease of vested property and shall not be entitled to hold on the property after the expiry of the period of lease and it has further been provided that he shall liable to be evicted  from the said property after the expiry of the lease period.  In both the clauses the word “shall” has been used meaningfully which indicated that it is the duty of the lessee, after expiry of the period of lease, to leave the property. It is his obligation. If we accept the position that the words “unlawful possession of any person” have been used in clause– 7 of the Circular for the former lessee as well then also after the expiry of the period of lease the former lessee is not entitled to hold property.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong>    The subsequent legislation to deal with vested property, is,  অর্পিত সম্পত্তি প্রত্যার্পন আইন, ২০০১  - Section 14 of the said Act says, অসহায়ী ইজারা প্রদত্ত প্রত্যার্পনযোগ্য সম্পত্তি সম্পর্কিত  বিধান । - (১) এই আইন প্রবর্তনের পূর্বে  সরকার কোন প্রত্যার্পনযোগ্য  সপত্তি অসহায়ী ইজারা প্রদান করিয়া  থাকিলে, ইজারা দলিলে বা অন্য কোন দলিলে বা অন্য কোন আইনে  বা যে কোন আদালতের সিদ্ধান্তে ভিন্নরূপ  যাহা কিছুই থাকুক না কেন, উওু ইজারার মেয়াদ  শেষে বা এই আইনে প্রর্বতনের পরবর্তী ৩৬০ (তিনশত ষাট) দিন, যাহা পূর্বে হয়, অতিবাহিত হওয়ার সংগে সংগে  উওু ইজারা বাতিল বলিয়া  গণ্য হইবে এবং ইজারা গ্রহীতা  অবিলম্বে উওু সম্পত্তির দখল  পরিত্যাগ করিবেন বা জেলা প্রশাসকের নিকট দখল বুঝাইয়া দিবেন । Section 2(T) defined the “প্রত্যার্পনযোগ্য সম্পত্তি”  which runs as follows :-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>প্রত্যার্পনযোগ্য সম্পত্তি অর্থ অর্পিত সম্পত্তি আইনের অধীনে তত্বাবধায়ক কর্তৃক অর্পিত সম্পত্তি হিসাবে তালিকাভূওু করা হইযাছে । এইরূপ সম্পত্তির মধ্যে  (অ) যাহা এই আইন প্রবর্তনের অব্যবহিত পূর্বে সরকারের দখলে  বা নিয়ন্ত্রণে ছিল ; বা  ...........<br/>অর্পিত সম্পত্তি <em>has been defined in section 2(Ka) which runs as follows :-</em><br/>২(ক) অর্পিত সম্পত্তি অর্থ অর্পিত সম্পত্তির আইনের অধীনে সরকারে ন্যস্ত সম্পত্তি।<br/><em>Section 3 of said Act provided a overriding provision which runs as follows:- </em><br/>আপাতত বলবৎ অন্য কোন আইনে অন্যরূপ যাহা কিছুই থাকুক না কেন এই আইনের বিধানবলী কার্যকর থাকিবে।<br/><em>By an amendment section 14 as substituted by the following provision:-</em> উওু আইনের ধারা ১৪ এবং উপধারা (১) এর পরিবর্তে নিম্মরুপ উপধারা (১) প্রতিসহাপিত হইবে,  যথাঃ-<br/>(১) অর্পিত সম্পত্তি প্রর্তার্পন না হওয়া পর্যন্ত উওু  জেলা প্রশাসকের নিয়ন্ত্রনে থাকিবে এবং তিনি প্রচলিত আইন অনুযায়ী উহা ইজারা প্রদান করিবেন। </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>26.</strong>    In view of the circumstances as mentioned above and the law and circular related thereto we have no other alternative but to hold that the possession of the petitioner in the scheduled property cannot be protected in any way and he is not entitled to hold possession of the property. The petitioner has got no option but to vacate the premises. It is the discretion of the Deputy Commissioner either to lease out or not to lease out any vested property subject to law related thereto.<br/> <br/><strong>27.       </strong>It appears from the impugned letter dated 22.6.2009 that the petitioner was requested to vacate the premises within 8.7.2009.  That is the petitioner was allowed 15 days time to vacate the same. It is not the case of the petitioner that the Government compelled the petitioner to vacate the premises without any notice. If we accept the submission of Mr. Razzaq that ‘unauthorized occupant’ as used in clause 4 and 5 and “any person in unlawful possession” of clause 7 connote same meaning even then it can be concluded that the respondents allowed  15 days time to the petitioner to vacate the premises, that is, clause 7 of the circular has been complied with substantially. The contents of the notice issued on 22.6.2009 addressing the Chairman, Imam Gazzali Institute from the office of the Deputy Commissioner are as follows:- “</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>বিষয়ঃ- ভি,পি, কেস নং-৩(পাব)  /৮৬-৮৭ ভুক্ত অর্পিত সম্পত্তির দখল  ছেড়ে  দেয়া প্রসংগে। <br/>উপরোক্ত বিষয়ে পরিপ্রেক্ষিতে জানানো যাচ্ছে  যে, ভি,পি, মিস  কেস নং-০৩(পাব)/৮৬-৮৭ ভুক্তি অর্পিত সম্পত্তি স্মৃতি সংগ্রহ শালা প্রতিষ্ঠার লক্ষ্যে আগামী ০৮/০৭/২০০৯ খ্রিঃ তারিখের মধ্যে উক্ত সম্পত্তির দখল  ছেড়ে  দেওয়ার জন্য তাঁকে অনুরোধ করা হলো।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>28.    </strong>It is clear from the notice that the Government has taken decision to establish a “স্মৃতি  সংগ্রহশালা"  in the scheduled property and for the purpose  to establish the same the premises is required  and accordingly, the petitioner is allowed time till 08.7.2009 to hand over possession of the same. Notice is making something known to a person of which he was or might be ignorant. Notice in its legal sense is information concerning a fact, actually communicated to a person by unauthorized person. Giving notice means that it should reach the hands of a person to whom it has to be given and the giving is complete when it has been offered to a person. Here, the Deputy Commissioner; the controller of the vested property, is the authorized person to lease out the scheduled property and he has taken decision not to lease out the same to the petitioners for establishment of “স্মৃতি  সংগ্রহশালা’’ and 15 days time has been allowed the petitioner to vacate the possession of the premises and it is not denied that the said notice has not been offered or communicated to the petitioner. That is provision of service of notice has been complied with. It is to be relevant here to mention that circular is not law. The same is an announcement or directive  typically in the form of a printed leaflet intended to be sent to many persons. The same is a administrative guide line.<br/> <br/><strong>29.    </strong>Submission of Mr. Razzaq so for violation of the principle of   natural justice is concerned it appears to us that the latest law has given wide discretion to the Deputy Commissioner in respect of leasing out the vested property. Said discretion is subject to the provision of law. We do not find any law to deal the affairs of leasing out the Vested property except circular which has got no force of law. That administrative desecration authorized by law that the Deputy Commissioner possesses power to administer the vested property. In the case of R.S. Das Vs. Union of India reported in AIR 1987 SC page 593 the Supreme Court of India observed, “It is well established that the rules of natural justice are not rigid rules; they are flexible and their application depends upon the setting and the background of statutory provision, nature of right which may be affected and the consequences which may entail its application depends upon the facts and circumstances of each  case”. Here, the Government has decided not to lease out the scheduled property to the petitioner in order to establish a “স্মৃতি  সংগ্রহশালা’’ . The petitioner has got no right in the property after the expiry of the period of lease. We shall conclude this issue with the words of Magarry in the case of John Vs. Rees (1969) 2 ALL E R. Page 274 which are:- “the result is obvious from start”. The petitioner has not acquired any right due to his previous lease he has not been affected in not giving him any opportunity of being heard.  In the case of Breen Vs. Amalgamated Engineering Union reported in (1991) 2B 175 Lord Denning stated that if a man see us a privilege to which he has no particular claim such as an appointment to some post or other then he can turned away without word. He need not be heard . No explanation need be given. But if he is a man whose property is at stake, or who is being deprive of his livelihood then reasons should be given why he is being  turned down and he should be given a chance to be heard. Here the scheduled property is the paternal property of Shuchitra Sen and Government is the custodian of the same having empowered to administer and dispose the same. The petitioner has no right in the property.  <br/> <br/><strong>30.    </strong>The next submission of Mr. Razzaq is that in view of Annexure-E the petitioner would get yearly lease of the disputed property until the Government adopts decision to lease out the vested property permanently. Getting such assurance the petitioner repaired the building spending huge amount legitimately expecting that he would get yearly lease and thereafter get permanent settlement after adoption of the law of permanent settlement. He submits that such legitimate expectation has got basis. After issuance of Annexure–E, the Government continuously leased out the said property to the petitioner. Mr. Razzaq relied upon the case of Dr. Abeda Begum and others Vs. Public Service Commission, reported in 59 DLR (HCD) 182. In the said decision it is held that the doctrine of legitimate expectation can be invoked if the impugned decision affected a person by depriving of some benefit or advantage which he had been in the passed permitted by the decision-maker to enjoy and which he can legitimately expect to continue to do until there has been communicated to him some rational grounds for withdrawing it. He also cited the  case of Shirajul Islam and others Vs. Bangladesh, reported in 60 DLR(HCD) 79 wherein  it has been held, “ The mere reasonable or “legitimate expectation” of a citizen  in such a situation, may not by itself be a distinct  enforceable  right, but failure to consider and given due weight to it may render the decision arbitrary, and this is now the requirement of due consideration of a ‘legitimate expectation” form part of the principle of non-arbitrariness, a necessary concomitant of the rule of law. Every ‘legitimate expectation’  is a relevant  factor requiring  due consideration in a fair decision making process”.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Doctrine of ‘legitimate expectation’ is a new emerging concept. In Halsbury Laws of England it is stated that the expectation may arise either from representation or promise made by the authority, including and implied representation or from consistent past practice. In the case of Attorney General  of Hong Kong Vs. Ng Yuen Shin, reported in 1983- 2 ALL.E.R. 346 it was held, “When a public authority has promised to follow a certain procedure it is in the interest of good administration that it should act fairly and should implement its promise, so long as the implementation does not interfere with its statutory duty”.  In the case of Schmidt Vs. Secretary of State, reported in 1969 1 ALL.E.R. page -409 it was observed, “ Even in the cases where there is no legal right he may still have legitimate expectation of receiving  the benefit  of privilege such expectation may either from express promise or from existence  of regular practice which the applicant  can reasonable expectation by invoking principle analogous to natural justice and fair play in action. In the case of Madras City Wine Merchant’s Association -Vs- The State of Tamil Nadu reported in AIR 1994(SC) 509 it was observed by the Supreme of India,  “Legitimate expectation may arise (a) if there is a express promise given by Public Authority (b) because of the existence of a regular practice which the claimant can reasonably expect to continue, (c) such an expectation must be reasonable”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>31.</strong>    We shall consider the submission of Mr. Razzaq on Legitimate expectation finally along with his next submission on “Promissory estoppel” because two doctrines and arguments under the label of estoppel and legitimate expectation are substantially the same.<br/> <br/><strong>32.</strong>    Mr. Razzaq submits that giving assurance to settle the disputed property permanently issuing Annexure-E the respondents are barred by the Provision of estoppel to say that they would not lease out the premises to the petitioner. Mr. Razzaq relied upon the case of M/S. Motilal Padampal Sugar Mills Co. Ltd.  Vs. The State of Uttor Prodesh reported in AIR 1979 S.C. Page 621. In cited case it was observed, “The true principle of promissory estoppel seems to be that where one party has by his words or conduct made to the other a clear and unequivocal promise which  is intended to create legal relations or effect a legal relationship to arise in the future, knowing or intending that it would be acted upon by the other party to whom the promise is made and it is in fact so acted upon by the other party, the promise would be binding on the party making it and he would not be entitled to go back upon it, if it would be inequitable to allow him to do so having regard to the dealings which have taken place between the parties, and this would be so irrespective of whether there is any pre-existing relationship between the parties or not.” His next citation is the case of Secretary, Ministry of Industries, National Industries Division Vs. Saleh Ahmed and another reported in 46 DLR (AD) 148 wherein it was held, “Having taken the decision on agreement that the specialized  textile mills will be returned to their former Bangalee owners, it is not available to the   Government, now to say that the decision had been revised in so far as the Mohammadi is concerned although in the case of other five concerns mentioned in the Annexure-B the Government had already released them.”<br/> <br/><strong>33.</strong>    The letter relating to lease out the disputed property measuring an area of .2125 acre of plot No. 587, S.A. Khatian No. 99 of Mouza Gopalpur Pabna has been communicated to the chairman Imam Gazzali Institute, Pabna under Memo No.214 V.P. dt.23.3.1987, contents of the aid notice runs as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>বিষয়ঃ- ভি, পি, কেস নং-৩(পাব) ৮৬-৮৭ ভুওু  গোপালপুর  মহল্লার হোল্ডিং নং-২১৫/১৯৭ এর ইজারা প্রসংগে ।<br/><br/>‘‘আপনার ১১-১২-১৯৮৬ তারিখের ১০নং স্বারক পত্রে চাহিদা  মোতাবেক নিম্ম তপশীল বর্নিত সম্পত্তির বাড়ী নিম্মে উল্লেখিত শর্তে মোতাবেক মাসিক ২৫০/- টাকা ভাডায় অসহায়ী একসনা ভিত্তিক ১৩৯৩  সনের জন্য আপনার অনুকুলে ইজারা  দেওয়া হইল। অত্র আদেশ ১লা  পৌষ ১৩৯৩ হইতে কার্যকরী হইবে এবং তার পূর্বের বকেয়া ভাড়ার টাকা পূর্ব ধার্যকৃত হারে অত্র বিভাগে প্রদান করিতে হইবে।"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>34.    </strong>Three of the terms and conditions as stipulated in the said letter are relevant here to mention which are:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>(২) আপনি বিনানুমতিতে অত্র সম্পত্তির উপর পাকা/ কাচা বা কোন প্রকার বাড়ী ঘর নির্মান /তৈয়ার করিতে পাররিবন না।<br/>(৪)  ইজারার সময়সীমা শেষ অন্তে অর্থাৎ বৎসরের প্রারম্ভে ইজারা নবায়নের আবেদন করিতে হইবে অন্যথায় ইজারা বাতিল বলিয়া গন্য হইবে।<br/>(৬) অত্র আদেশ প্রাপ্তির ১ মাসের মধ্যে ১.৫০ পয়সা মুল্যের ডেমির উপর একটি লিজ দলিল গ্রহন করিতে হইবে। উওু ডেমি ইজারাদারকে সরবরাহ করিতে হইবে।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>35.       </strong>From the aforesaid letter it appears that the authority leased out the premises not the land because the words “নিম্ম তপশীল বর্নিত সম্পত্তির বাড়ী নিম্মে উল্লেখিত শর্ত  মোতাবেক” lease was granted for a period of one year but same was  renewable. There is nothing in the writ petition that as per clause 6 of the conditions any lease agreement was ever executed.<br/> <br/><strong>36.</strong>       From annexure-G series it appears that the petitioners paid rent of years 1409 and 1410 B.S. on 14.6.2003, 1411 B.S. on 17.5.2004, 1412 B.S. on 25.5.2005, 1413 B.S. on 29.6.2006, 1414 B.S. on 25.3.2008, 1415 B.S. on 7.8.2008 which clearly showed that the petitioner violated the terms No.4 of the letter above quoted. That is the petitioner was a habitual defaulter in payment of lease money.<br/> <br/><strong>37.</strong>       Mr. Razzaq relied upon Annexure-E and made his submission on legitimate expectation and promissory estoppel. Said letter was issued from Ministry of Land addressing the Chairman Imam Gazzali Institute. The contents of Annexure-E runs as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>বিষয়ঃ- ভি,পি, কেস নং-৩(পাব)  /৮৬-৮৭ ভুক্ত অর্পিত ও অনাগরিক সম্পত্তি পাবনা ইমাম গাজ্জালী ইনষ্টিটিউটের জন্য সহায়ী ইজারা বন্দোবস্ত প্রসংগে।<br/>সুত্রঃ-  তাহার স্বারক নং-১৭১৩ ভি,পি, তাং ১৬/৭/৯১ ইং ৩১-৩-৯৮বাং<br/>উপরোক্ত বিষয় ও পত্রেসুত্রে নির্দেশক্রমে জানানো যাইতেছে  যে, বর্তমানে অর্পিত সম্পত্তি স্থায়ী বন্দোবস্তের বিধান নাই ফলে যতদিন পর্যন্ত অর্পিত সম্পত্তি সম্পর্কে চূড়ান্ত সিন্ধান্ত গৃহিত না হয় ততদিন পর্যন্ত উল্লেখিত অর্পিত সম্পত্তি প্রতিষ্ঠানটির অনুকুলে একসনা বন্দোবস্ত অব্যাহত থাকিবে।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong>38.</strong>    From the said letter it indicated that the same was issued on the basis of the application of the petitioner dated 16.7.1991 for permanent settlement which was rejected but it was mentioned that the process of yearly lease should be continued. Accordingly yearly lease was continued till 1415 B.S.  Subsequently another letter was issued on 25.05.1992   (annexure-F) upon which Mr. Razzaq relied on and submitted that getting assurance of permanent settlement the petitioner spent huge money for repairing the house thereby the petitioner legitimate expected that he may get the land permanently. The contents of letter dated 25.2.1992 are as follows:- “উপরোক্ত বিষয় ও সূত্রে উল্লেখিত  স্বারকের বরাতে জানান যাইতেছে  যে, অর্পিত সম্পত্তির উপর অবস্থিত ইমাম গাজ্জালী ইনষ্টিটিউট নামীয়  স্কুলটির বাড়ীর মেরামত খরচ স্কুল কর্তৃপক্ষ  সহানীয় প্রশাসনের সম্মতিএুমে নিজেরা বহন করিতে পারে। তর্বে শর্ত থাকিবে যে এই মেরামত খরচ বহন করার কারনে বাড়ীর উপর তাহাদের  কোন অধিকার /দাবী বর্তাইবে না।’’<br/> <br/><strong>39.</strong>    If we consider the Annexure-C, E and F together it will be apparent that the Government never assured the petitioner that they shall lease out the disputed property permanently  to the petitioner rather in the latest letter dated 25.5.1992  it has been clearly stated- " তবে শর্ত থাকিবে  যে, এই  মেরামত খরচ বহন করার কারনে বাড়ীর উপর তাহাদের কোন অধিকার/দাবী বর্তাইবে না’’ Moreover, accepting the clause 4, 5 and 6 of the circular dated 23.5.1977 the petitioner took lease of the premises. Estoppel can only arise from a clear definite statement and the same must be unambiguous. To create an estoppel against a party, his declaration, act or omission must be of an unequivocal character. We do not find anything in the papers submitted by the petitioners that the Government has given any such declaration that the scheduled vested property should permanently be leased out to the petitioner. It is relevant here to refer the case of Union of India Vs. International Trading Co. reported in AIR 2003 SC. 3983. In the said case company was granted a fishing permit. It was, however, not renewed by the Government due to change in policy. A writ petition filed by the Company was dismissed by a single Judge but was allowed by the Division Bench in appeal. The Government approached the Supreme Court. Allowing the appeal and dismissing the writ petition the Supreme Court of India held that there was change of policy by the Government and conscious decision was taken in public interest and the doctrine of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation had no application.<br/> <br/><strong>40.</strong>    Considering the aforesaid facts and laws we are of the view that the submission of Mr. Razzaq on legitimate expectation and promissory estoppel does not carry any force. <br/> <br/><strong>41.</strong>    Mr. Razzaq submits that Writ Petition No. 6766 of 2011 filed by way of public interest litigation is not maintainable. The allegation as brought in the said writ petition against the added respondent who is the petitioner of the Writ Petition No.4608 of 2009 is not acceptable. He was not the unauthorized land graver.  He was inducted into possession of the property by the respondents as lessee in 1986-87 and he had been possessing the same legally and has been possessing the same after expiry of period of lease. He had filed an application to get the said lease renewed for the year 1416 and 1417 B.S. <br/> <br/><strong>42.</strong>    Mr. Manzill Murshid, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner of writ petition No. 6766 of 2011 submits that he has made the said statement relying upon the news item published in the News Paper. He was not aware about the story of lease of disputed premises in favour of the petitioner. He submits that  he has come before this court, in order to protect  and preserve the disputed property which is the birth place of famous artist  Suchitra Sen. The petitioner has had no intention to assault the petitioner of Writ Petition No. 4608 of 2009 in any way.<br/> <br/><strong>43.</strong>    The learned Attorney General submits that since the District Administration has already taken steps to establish “Suchitra Sen Smriti Sangrahashala”, in fact, the second writ is redundant. From the impugned order dated 22.6.2009 (Annexure-A) of writ petition No.4608 of 2009 it appears the District Administration has already taken decision to establish a Sangrahashala. The contents of the said order runs as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"উপযুক্ত বিষয়ে পরিপ্রেক্ষিতে জানানো যাচ্ছে  যে, ভি,পি, মিস কেস  নং-০৩(পাব)/৮৬-৮৭ ভুওু অর্পিত সম্পত্তিতে স্মৃতি সংগ্রহশালা প্রতিষ্ঠার লক্ষ্যে আগামী ০৮/০৭/২০০৯ খ্রিঃ তারিখের মধ্যে উক্ত অর্পিত সম্পত্তির দখল ছেড়ে দেওয়ার জন্য তাঁকে অনুরোধ করা হলো।"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>44.</strong>    At the time of hearing the Rule the learned Deputy Attorney General produced the Photostat copy of the case record of V.P. Case No.3 (Pab) of 1986-1987 in this Court. On perusal of the case record it appears that the Deputy Commissioner, Pabna by a letter communicated under Memo No. জেঃ প্রঃ /পাব/ রাজস্ব/ভি,পি,কেস-৩(পাব)/৮৬-৮৭/২০০৯-১৪৬৩ dated 02.09.2009  has requested the Secretary, Ministry Land for necessary approval stating the present position of scheduled property. Relevant portion of the said letter run as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>উল্লেখ্য যে, উপমহাদেশের প্রখ্যাত চলচিত্র অভিনেত্রী সুচিত্রা সেনের পৈত্রিক ভিটা হচ্ছে অর্পিত বাড়ী। সুচিত্রা সেন এই বাড়ীতে তার শৈশব অতিবাহিত করেন এবং পাবনা সরকারী বালিকা উচ্চ বিদ্যালয়ের পড়াশুনাকালীন ভারতে চলে যান। পাবনার সুধী সমাজ দীর্ঘদিন যাবৎ এই বিখ্যাত অভিনেত্রীর স্মৃতি বিজড়িত বাড়ীর বর্তমান লীজ বাতিল করে তথায়  সুচিত্রা সেন স্মৃতি সংগ্রহশালা সহাপনের দাবী করে আসছে এবং এ বিষয়ে জাতীয় ও সহানীয়  দৈনিক পত্রিকাসমূহ  সমর্থনে প্রবন্ধ ও সংবাদ প্রকাশিত হয়েছে। সুশীল সমাজের পক্ষে  থেকে  ঐ বাড়ীটিতে সুচিত্রাসেন  স্মৃতি সংগ্রহশালা সহাপনের জন্য আবেদন পাওয়া যায় এবং এ বিষয়ে  জোর দাবী এবং তদবির  চলছে।<br/><br/>বর্নিত অবস্থাধীনে সুত্রে বর্নিত অব্যাহতভাবে একসনা লীজের অনুমোদন বাতিল করে জেলা প্রশাসনকে অন্যান্য ভি,পি, সম্পত্তি লীজ প্রদানের মতো বর্নিত  ভি,পি, সম্পত্তি একসনা লীজ প্রদানের ক্ষমতা দিয়ে জেলা প্রশাসনের তত্তবাবধানে উপমহাদেশের প্রখ্যাত অভিনেত্রী সুচিত্রা সেনের স্মৃতি সংরক্ষনের সুযোগ দানের জন্য বিনীত  অনুরোধ করা হলো।</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 120px;"><br/>(ড. এ,কে,এম. মনজুর কাদির)<br/>জেলা প্রশাসক, পাবনা।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>45.</strong>       In view of the fact that the District Administration has already taken steps to evict the leasee for establishment of “Suchitra Sen Smrity Sangrahashala” and the submission of the learned Attorney General for the State that Government has already taken decision to establish Suchitra Sen Srimiti Sangrashala in the disputed property, the rule as issued in the writ petition No. 6766 of 2011, in fact, has become  infractuous.<br/> <br/><strong>46.</strong>       The petitioner of first petition, i.e. Writ petition No. 4608 of 2009 entered into the scheduled property legally and had been in possession the same in accordance with law. The statements made in the second writ petition are not whole true.<br/> <br/><strong>47.</strong>       At the time of filing writ petition by way of public interest litigation   the petitioner of the second writ petition should have narrated the material facts correctly. In the case of Ashok Kumer Panday Vs. State of West Bengal reported in AIR 2004 S.C. page 280 it has been observed by the Supreme Court of India that before passing any order on PIL the court must be satisfied about (i) the credentials of the applicants (ii) The prima-facie correctness of the information given by him; and (iii) the information being specific and definite. The information should also show gravity and seriousness. In the present P.I.L. the credential of the applicant is well acceptable but he failed to fill up the other two requirements as quoted above. To file P.I.L. petition, the petitioner must come not only with clean hands but also with clean heart, clean mind and clean objective. We have no doubt that the petitioner has got all those qualifications but he has failed to give all informations before the Court. However we are concluding this issue with remarks made by Bhagabati J. in the case of S.P. Gupta Vs. Union of India (popularly known as First Judge’s Case)  reported in AIR 1982 S.C. Page 148 . It was observed that the frontiers of the public expending far and wide and new concepts and doctrines which will change the complexion of the law and which were so far embedded in the womb of the future are beginning to be born. <br/> <br/><strong>48.</strong>       In view of the facts and circumstances as mentioned above our considered conclusions are that -</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong>(1)</strong>    Since the period of lease of the petitioner of Writ Petition No 4608 of 2009 expired  in 1415 B.S. and the authority  concerned has not renewed the lease of the petitioner, the petitioner is not entitled to hold the premises in question and he must vacate the possession of the same. His unauthorized occupation in the scheduled property cannot be protected on an application under Article 102 of the Constitution by this court.<br/><strong>(2)   </strong> Due to the possession for about 23 years as yearly lease the petitioner, who is a habitual defaulter in payment of lease money,  has not acquired any vested right in the property and to hold the possession of the scheduled premises so he is not entitled to get any direction from this Court to get lease to protect his possession. Conseque-ntly the direction as sought for is hereby refused.<br/><strong>(3) </strong>   Since the steps for establishment of “Suchitra Sen Smrity Sangrahashala” has already been taken by the authority, we do not find any necessity to interfere with the writ petition No. 6766 of 2011 filed by way of public interest litigation. The same is redundant.<br/><strong>(4)  </strong>  The Government is directed to implement the decision of establishment of “Suchitra Sen Smrity Sangrahashala” immediately to protect and preserve the birth place of  Suchitra Sen considering her contributions in our cultural arena.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>49.</strong>    In the result both the rules in Writ Petition No. 4608 of 2009 and writ petition No. 6766 of 2011 are discharged with the direction and observation made above.<br/> <br/><strong>50.</strong>    Stay granted in Writ Petition No. 4608 of 2009 and ad-interim direction passed in Writ Petition No. 6766 of 2011 are hereby recalled and vacated.<br/><strong>51.</strong>    At this stage Mr. Imran Siddique, the learned Advocate for the petitioner in Writ Petition No. 4608 of 2009 prayed for stay of the operation of the order of this Court for a period of two months to shift the school from the scheduled property.  For the ends of justice the petitioner is allowed two months’ time to shift the school from the scheduled property.<br/> <br/><strong>52.</strong>    The photocopy of the V.P. Case No.3 (Pab) of 1986-87 be kept with the record.<br/> <br/><strong>53.</strong>    Send the copies of the Judgment and order to-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>(1)     Secretary, Ministry of Land,<br/>(2)     Secretary, Ministry of Works,<br/>(3)     Secretary, Ministry of Cultural Affairs,<br/>(4)     Deputy Commissioner, Pabna and<br/>(5)     Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) Pabna for taking steps accordingly.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Abu Zafor Siddique, J:</u> </span>           </strong><br/> <br/><strong>1.</strong>         All these Rules were heard together and disposed of by a common judgment as they do involve similar questions of facts and laws though the parties are different.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong>         In Civil Revision No. 1454 of 2009, Rule was issued calling upon the opposite parties to show cause as to why the impugned order No.47 dated 23.10.2008 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, and Artha Rin Adalat, Court No.02, Dhaka in Artho Execution Case No. 18 of 2003 should not be set aside and/or such other or further order or orders passed as to this Court may seem fit and proper.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>         In Civil Revision No.1318 of 2009, Rule was issued calling upon the opposite parties to show cause as to why the impugned order No.54 dated 23.10.2008 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, Court No. 2, Dhaka in Artha Rin Jari No.15 of 2003 should not be set aside and/or such other or further order or orders passed as to this Court may seem fit and proper.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>         In Civil Revision No.195 of 2010, Rule was issued calling upon the opposite party to show cause as to why the Order No.17 dated 03.08.2008 passed by the learned Additional Joint District Judge (Artha Rin Adalat), Jessore in Money Execution Case No.07 of 2007 should not be set aside and/or such other or further order or orders passed as to this Court may seem fit and proper. <br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>         In all these revisional applications the common fact is that the respective opposite parties namely different financial institutions instituted “Artha Rin Suits” in the respective Artha Rin Adalat impleading the respective petitioners and others as the defendants for realization of loan amount. In all these cases the plaintiffs-opposite-parties obtained decree against the defendants and pursuant to the decrees obtained by them they have filed execution cases as per the provision of Artha Rin Adalat Ain of 2003 (shortly the Ain of 2003) in the respective Artha Rin Adalat (shortly the Adalat) as define in section 2(kha) of the 2003. During pendency of the respective Artha Rin Execution cases, the respective decree holder banks filed applications under section 34 of the Ain of 2003 for detaining the petitioners in civil jail, in order to realize the decreetal amount. In all these revisional applications before this Court, the petitioners have challenged the orders passed by the Adalat directing to detain the respective petitioners as per section 34 of the Ain of 2003. Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid orders passed by the court below the respective petitioners moved these applications and obtained the present Rules.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>         In Civil Revision Nos. 1454 of 2009 and 1318 of 2009 Mr. Md. Nurul Amin, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioners submits that the Court below without applying its judicial mind and without considering the facts and circumstances and the provision of law most illegally and in an arbitrary manner passed the impugned judgment and orders and thereby the Court below committed error occasioning failure of justice. He further submits that in the case in hand the Court below without complying with the provision of section 34(9) of the Ain of 2003 passed the impugned judgment and order and thereby committed error of law occasioning failure of justice. He further submits that the Court below without issuing any notice or giving any opportunity of being heard passed the impugned judgment and orders and thereby the Court below not only committed an error of law but also violated the principle of natural justice. However, he submits that the petitioner could have preferred writ petition before this court challenging the impugned order because the question of maintainability of the instant Revisional applications is involved. He also prays for a direction from this court enabling the petitioner to approach the proper forum.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>         Mr. Md. S.M. Maniruzzaman with Mr. M. Ataul Gani, the learned Advocate appeared on behalf of the petitioner in Civil Revision No.195 of 2010.  He, however, adopted the submission made by Mr. Md. Nurul Amin, the learned Advocate.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>         Mr. Shahajada Al Amin Kabir, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the opposite party in Civil Revision No.1454 of 2009 and Civil Revision No.1318 of 2009 vehemently opposes the Rule and submits that the Court below in the cases in hand committed no error of law occasioning failure of justice in passing the impugned judgments and orders and as such all these Rules are liable to the discharged with costs. By referring to the provision of the Ain of 2003 he submits that the revisional applications under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure is not at all maintainable as no revision lies against any interlocutory order passed by the Adalat  exercising the power conferred by the Ain of 2003.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>         No one appear on behalf of the opposite party Civil Revision No.195 of 2010.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>       We have heard the learned Advocates, perused the revisional applications, impugned judgments and orders, annexures and the provision of law.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>       On perusal of the same it appears that in all these Rules the opposite parties instituted suits in the respective Adalats for realization of outstanding loan from the borrower petitioners and after due process of law the respective courts passed decrees in favour of the opposite parties. Pursuant to the provisions laid down in the Ain of 2003, the respective opposite party instituted execution cases as per Chapter-VI of the Ain of 2003. Thereafter, the Courts below proceeded with the execution cases in the respective Artha Rin Adalat. During pendency of the execution cases on the applications made by the opposite parties the Courts below passed the impugned judgment and orders for detaining the respective petitioners in civil jail. Being aggrieved the petitioners moved this Court.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>       Section 34(1) of the Ain, 2003 deals with the provision relating to detaining any person in civil jail which runs as follows;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“৩৪। (১) উপ-ধারা (১২) এর বিধান সাপেক্ষে, অর্থ ঋণ আদালত, ডিক্রীদার কর্তৃক দাখিলকৃত দরখাসেত্মর পরিপেক্ষিতে, ডিক্রীর টাকা পরিশোধে বাধ্য করিবার প্রায়স হিসাবে, দায়িককে ৬ (ছয়) মাস পর্যমত্ম দেওয়ানী কারাগারে আটক রাখিতে পারিবে|”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>13.</strong>    It appears that from the above provision  of law the Court namely “Artha Rin Adalat” can pass an order detaining a judgment debtor in civil jail up to 6 (six) months  for realization of outstanding dues. It appears that in the present cases in hand the Courts below passed the orders on the basis of the applic-ations made by the respective Banks. On perusal of the same it is apparent that the Courts below namely “Artha Rin Adalats” reserve the powers to detain a person for the period stipulated in sub-section (1) of section 34.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>    Hence, the main question which is to be decided in these revisions is whether the instant revisional applications under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure are at all maintainable against any interlocutory order passed by the Artha Rin Adalat exercising the powers conferred by the provisions of the Ain of 2003. It is apparent that the instant proceedings are pending being Artha Rin Execution Cases and before the competent Artha Rin Adalat established as per section 2(kha) read with section 4 of the said Ain of 2003. Apart from that as per section 5 of the Ain of 2003, the Court enjoys exclusive jurisdiction relating to all matters for realization of loan of the financial institutions as defined in section 2(ka) of  the said Ain.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>    Section 26 to section 39 of the Ain of 2003 deal with the detailed provisions relating to execution proceeding by a Artha Rin Adalat and these provisions described the procedure for realization of the loan after passing of decree by the Adalat. There is no doubt about the jurisdiction of the Court, in which the execution cases have been filed and proceeded. As per the Ain of 2003 all these Courts are, “Artha Rin Adalat”. Section 2(kha) of the said Ain runs as follows;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“(খ) ‘‘আদালত’’ বা ‘‘অর্থ ঋণ আদলত’’ অর্থ এই আইনের উদ্দেশ্য পূরণকল্পে ধারা ৪ এ উলিস্ন­খিত অধীন প্রতিষ্ঠিত বা ঘোষিত কোন আদালত অথবা অর্থ ঋণ আদালত হিসাবে গণ্য হইবে মর্মে কোন যুগ্ম-জেলা জজের আদালত।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>16.</strong>    Now it is to be seen whether impugned orders passed by the executing Court in the present Artha Rin Execution Case are revisable under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure and as such, the said issue needs to be dealt with before entering into the merit of the cases.<br/>Section 3 of the Ain of 2003 reads as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>৩। আইনের প্রধান্য- আপাততঃ বলবৎ অবণ্ঠ কোন আইনে ভিন্নতর যাহা কিছুই থাকুক না কেন, এই আইনের বিধানাবলীই কার্যকর হইবে|<br/><br/>Furthermore, section 26 of the Ain of 2003 runs as follows:<br/>২৬ । দেওয়ানী কার্যবিধি আইনের প্রয়োগ- The Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 এর অধীন মানি ডিক্রী জারী সংক্রামত্ম বিধানবলী, এই আইনের বিধানবলীর সহিত অসংগতিপূর্ন না হওয়া সাপেক্ষে, এই আইনের অধীন ডিক্রী জারীর ক্ষেত্রে প্রযোজ্য হইবে|</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>17.</strong>    It is important to mention that in promulgating this “Remedial Statute”, the Ain of 2003, the legislature has intended to cure some defects, errors and procedures of the repealed Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 1990, in order to ensure speedy recovery of long pending outstanding dues advanced by the financial institutions to the borrowers who are in the habit of developing a culture of non-payment of loan. To put an end to such culture some special provisions have been made including rigorous provisions like sections 19, 34, 41, 42 and 44 in the Ain, 2003. If the defaulters or borrowers are allowed to challenge each and every order passed by the Adalat, the Ain of 2003 will have to face the same consequence like that of the Ain, 1990. So, the Court must avoid construction of statute which will render the statute meaningless and ineffective and the court is to adopt the rule of liberal construction so as to give meaning to all parts of the provisions and to make the whole statute effective and operative. Apart from that the Ain of 2003 is a special law effective for the very purpose of realizing loan from the defaulted borrowers.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>    From the above quoted provisions of law, it is manifest that the legislature with the intention of speedy recovery of loan liability without any hindrance or obstruction being created by the judgment-debtors by way of filing frivolous application before the Court of law to delay and frustrate realization of the decretal amount incorporated non-obstinate clause in section 3 of the Ain of 2003 to have the effect that the said Ain shall prevail over other laws which are contrary to the said Ain of 2003.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>    As to the significance of non-obstante clause our Apex Court in the case of New Ideal Engineering Works Ltd. Vs. Bangladesh Shilpa Bank and others reported in 42 DLR (AD) 221 held as follows;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“a non-obstinate clause is usually used in a provision to  indicate that, that provision should prevail despite anything to the contrary in the provision  mentioned in such non-obstinate clause.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>20.</strong>    Section 26 of the Ain of 2003 has expressly debarred application of the provisions of other statutes including the Code of Civil Procedure pending execution proceeding so far it is inconsistent with the provisions of the Ain of 2003. In other words, the relevant provisions of the   Code of Civil Procedure so far it relates to the procedure to make the suit ready for holding trial of Artha Rin suit as well as for execution of decrees are applicable which are not in conflict with the Ain of  2003.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>    Section 44 of the Ain of 2003 is relevant to the instant civil revisional applications, which runs as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“৪৪। অমত্মর্বর্তীকালীন আদেশ-(১) অর্থ ঋণ আদালত, মামলার সঠিক ও পরিপূর্ণ বিচার ও ন্যায় বিচারের প্রয়োজনে এবং বিচার কার্যক্রমের অপব্যবহার প্রতিরোধকল্পে যেরূপ অমর্ত্মবর্তীকালীন আদেশ প্রদান করা সংগত মনে করিবে, সেরূপ অমর্ত্মবর্তীকালীন আদেশ প্রদান করিতে পারিবে।<br/>(২) উপ-ধারা (৩) এর বিধান সাপেক্ষে, এই আইনের অধীনে কোন আদালত কর্তৃক প্রদত্ত কোন অমর্ত্মবর্তীকালীন আদেশকে উচ্চতর কোন আদালতে আপীল বা রিভিশন আকারে বির্তর্কিত করা যাইবে না।<br/>(৩) উপ-ধারা (২) এর বিধান সত্ত্বেও, কোন পক্ষ ধারা ৪১ এর অধীন দায়েরকৃত আপীল এইরূপ কোন বিষয় যুক্তি হিসাবে গ্রহন করিতে পারিবে, যাহা উপরি-ঊভষ্ফভগধ বিধানের কারণে বিতর্কিত করা যায় নাই, এবং আপীল আদালত ঐরূপ বিষয় বিবেচনায় গ্রহণ করিয়া ন্যায়বিচারের স্বার্থে উপযুক্ত যে কোন আদেশ প্রদান করিতে পারিবে|</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>22.</strong>    In view of above provision of law no interloc-utory order passed by the Artha Rin Adalat under the Ain of 2003 is appealable or revisable. In the case of Sultana Jute Mills Ltd. and others Vs. Agrani Bank and others reported in 46 DLR (AD) 174 the Appellate Division held as follows;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“revision is impliedly barred because the Adalat Act being  a special legislation setting up a special Court the remedies will follow as provided therein and if there is any exclusion indicated therein, as in section 6, it will include a remedy under the general law.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>23.</strong>    In the case of Mrs. Hosne Ara Begum and another Vs. Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited reported in 5 MLR (AD) 290 the Appellate Division further held;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“this Division has clearly held that revision does not lie against an order of Artha Rin Adalat.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>24.</strong>    In the case of <strong>Md. Harun-or Rashid Vs. Pubali Bank Limited and others reported in 12 MLR (AD) 343</strong> the Appellate Division held :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Joint  reading of section  6 (1) and 7 of the Act shows that all judgment and order not being a decree of the Artha Rin Adalat have been treated as final and conclusive. In such situation the party aggrieved by such judgment or order of the Artha Rin  Adalat cannot invoke revisional jurisdiction of the civil Court including the High Court Division under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure inasmuch as to construe otherwise would be inconsistent with the provisions of sections 5 (4) and 5(5) of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>25.</strong>    In the case of Kazi Gowaherul Islam (K J Islam) vs. Standard Co-operative Credit Society Ltd. and another reported in 50 DLR 333, Belayet Hossain vs. Bank Indosuez reported in 50 DLR 431, and the case of Iftekhar Afzal and another vs. Publi Bank Limited and others reported in 50 DLR 623 their Lordships also held that a revisional application under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure against any interlocutory order passed by an Artha Rin Adalat is not at all maintainable in law.<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong>    In the cases as mentioned above, the said observations/decisions of our Apex Court and this Court were given under the Ain of 1990, which has already been repealed, wherein there was no specific provision debarring exercise of revisional jurisdiction by the Court concerned including the High Court Division.

A presumption of consummation is raised from the retirement of the husband and wife, i.e. there should be no third person at the place and that the place should not be a public one, like a public bath, public road, a mosque etc. Where there has been prolonged and continuous cohabitation as husband and wife, in the absence of direct proof a presumption arises that there was a valid marriage. The law permits no specific ceremony for the contractual performance of a marriage: and no religions rites are necessary for contracting a valid marriage. There are even opinions that a marriage may be constituted without any ceremonial and even in the absence of direct proof, indirect proof might suffice. The High Court Division, in the premises, erred in holding that mere living together as husband and wife did not bring it within the bound of marriage. Apart from acknowledgment by either party, if there is continual cohabitation between a man and woman as husband and wife, there is presumptive marriage and legitimacy provided that the parties were not prohibited from intermarrying.  </strong><br/><strong>The High Court Division based its decision on piecemeal consideration of Mulla’s Mohammedan Law and arrived at a decision which is not supported by any of the authors of Mohammedan Law. ….

Sinha, J:</strong><br/> <br/><strong>1.</strong>         This appeal raises questions of some importance in the field of Mohammedan Law but they are not abstract questions which can be divorced from the facts giving rise to them and in order to resolve them the facts in some detail are necessary. .Appellant instituted a suit against the respondent for dower and maintenance in the Family Court. She claimed that though their marriage was solemnized according to Mohammedan Law, the Kabinnama was not registered. They lived as husband and wife together for a considerable time and the marriage was duly consummated. With the passage of time the respondent became more greedy and started demanding dowry from her and at one stage the respondent drove her away from his house. Respondent con-tested the suit denying the marriage and claimed that the appellant’s brother was an employee under him. He misappropriated a sum of taka thirty five thousand from his shop and to divert the said incident, the appellant instituted the suit by making wild allegations. Besides the evidence of the appellant, the Family Court on assessment of the evidence of Shadrul Islam (P.W.2), Madu Mia (P.W.3), Swapan (P.W.4) and Babul Mia (P.W.5) came to the definite finding that the respondent married the appellant and that they lived as husband and wife, and   3decreed the suit. The Court of appeal below affirmed the judgment. A single Bench of the High Court Division in exercise of revisional jurisdiction reversed the judgments of the courts below and dismissed the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong>      It has been observed by the Family Court that the appellant examined independent witnesses who stated in unequivocal terms that there was marriage between the appellant and the respondent, that they lived together as husband and wife and that the respondent examined nearest relations who are not reliable witnesses. The Family Court inferred adverse presumption against the respondent on the reasonings that though the respondent denied the marriage, he being the eldest among seven siblings, the marriage of his two younger brothers is not unnatural but considering the surrounding facts coupl with the nature of the witnesses examined by him led to the inference that there was legal marriage between the appellant and the respondent. The Court of appeal below also evaluated   the evidence on record afresh and arrived at the conclusion that the respondent failed to prove by adducing reliable evidence that he did not lead conjugal life with the appellant, that despite that there was no kabinnama, they lived as husband and wife which had been satisfactorily proved by the appellant by examining independent witnesses and that the Family Court was perfectly justified in decreeing the suit. The High Court Division held that in the absence of a registered kabinnama a special onus is cast upon the appellant to prove the fact about marriage, that there is no material to show that the marriage between the parties was solemnized after fulfillment of requirements laid down in paragraph 252 of the Mohammedan Law, that the appellant having failed to prove the marriage by examining competent witnesses her claim of marriage falls  to the ground and that mere living together did not bring her within the bounds of marriage.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>      Leave was granted to consider on three points, as to (1) whether non-registration of the marriage under Mohammedan Law makes the marriage illegal or irregular or non-existent, (2) whether continuous co-habitation by the appellant and the respondent over a period of three years as husband and wife coupled with their conduct infer a presumption as to the legal marriage, and (3) whether the High Court Division is justified in interfering with the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the Courts below on proper assessment of the evidence on record as to the solemnization of a legal marriage between the appellant and the respondent in exercise of revisional jurisdiction. Dr. Rabia Bhuiyan, learned counsel contended that the view of the High Court Division in drawing adverse presumption against the appellant merely on the ground of absence of kabinnama is based on misconception of law. According to the learned counsel, in view of the concurrent findings that the appellant and the respondent had lived together as husband and wife over a period of three years which suggested the presumption of legal marriage, the High Court Division erred in law in interfering with the said concurrent findings of fact.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>      The courts below on a thorough sifting of the evidence on record came to a definite conclusion that the marriage was consummated. The High Court Division did not at all repel the findings arrived at by the courts below on the point of consummation of marriage.  The High Court Division did not dislodge the findings of the courts below that the appellant and the respondent lived jointly for a considerable time as husband and wife but dismissed the suit mainly on the ground of the absence of registered kabinnama, and on the face of denial by the respondent, the appellant was required to prove solemnisation of marriage after observance of the requirements of paragraph 252 of the Mohammedan Law, the basic essentials of marriage, which she failed to prove by adducing reliable evidence. The High Court Division, however, believed   the appellant’s claim that they lived together as husband and wife but castigated such living as unethical observing “Now-a-days the obnoxious alien culture of living together has made its in-road into our society and this slowly is spreading its tentacles undermining our social value and the institution of marriage”. It seems to me that the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division has failed to address the point in dispute between the parties in the light of the evidence and the principles of law applicable in the facts of the given case.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>      Let us consider the concept of marriage under Mohammedan Law. Marriage under the Mohammedan Law is a civil contract requiring no ceremony or special formality. In Harvard Law Review, XXVII, 387 an article appears on ‘Requisites and Proof of Common Law Marriages’ explaining the concept of the common law marriage. F.B. Tyabji in his  Mohammedan Law at page 101 said, the principles stated in the article may be helpful in the decision of similar questions arising under Mohammedan Law. The article reads thus:  “From early times, it has not always been clear what acts were necessary to the validity of a marriage. According to early civil law the consent of the parties was sufficient; but it seems doubtful, whether under the early English common law a marriage without a minister was valid. In this country, however, many States have adopted the view that a marriage may be valid even without a ceremony before third parties. The rule is usually stated to be that an agreement to be married henceforth, followed by cohabitation, constitutes the so-called common law marriage. But both on principle and authority, it would seem that the agreement alone is sufficient to consummate a common law marriage, and that the subsequent cohabitation is important only as evidence of the agreement.” “Moreover, it is clear on the authorities, in the States where formal solemnization is not necessary, that although there is no proof of an actual written or oral contract, the agreement necessary to the formation of a common-law marriage may be inferred solely from the conduct of the parties.”<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>      The article then proceeds to refer to four situations which are said to be rather common: “(1) The only evidence of the agreement may be that the parties have lived together as husband and wife: from this a common law marriage is often inferred, even without proof of an express agreement: an implied agreement being sufficient. The parties may have purported to contract a marriage and lived together, but the agreement at the time it is entered into may be void because of some disability unknown to both parties. If, subsequently, the disability is removed, a new contract is in strictness.” <br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>      There is no dispute that the Mohammedan marriage among muslims is not sacrament but purely civil contract. Marriage brings about a relation based on and arising from, a permanent contract for intercourse and procreation of children between man and woman who are referred to as ‘parties to the marriage and, who after being married, become husband and wife. Though generally solemnized with recitations from Koran, yet no positive service peculiar to the occasion is prescribed by law; writing not required; validity and operation of whole depends upon declaration or proposal and acceptance or consent of contracting parties before competent witnesses; (Bail.1.4). In Asha B.V. Kadir B., (1909) 33 Mad 22, it is stated, “marriage is contract between parties to live as husband and wife for term of their lives.” In Muhammadan Law by Faiz Badruddin Tyabji, Third Edition, marriage is defined in paragraph 17, and after considering different authorities the essentials of marriage are summed up as under:  “Marriage arises in Muhammadan Law from a contract-(a) Providing for intercourse and the procreation of children; (b) commencing from the time of contract; (c) made for effectuating a marriage between a man and woman whose intermarriage is not prohibited by law; (d) entered into in accordance with the rules and forms laid down in s.17A to S.23, inclusive, and (e) by a person who has authority to contract in marriage the person purported to be married.” Quoting Fatawa Alamgiri in Abdul Kaidr V. Salina, (1886) 8 All.149(155) it is stated, “also for the solace of life; one of the prime and original necessities of man. Therefore lawful in extreme old age after hope of offspring has ceased and even in the last or death illness.”  The Mohammedan Law does not insist upon any particular form in which the contractual performance should be effected or that “the union should be evidenced by any writing, nor is the presence of witnesses essential for its validity”. In this   connection Syed Ameer Ali in his Mohammedan Law, 6<sup>th</sup> Edition, following Fatawai Alamgiri,  Vol.11 page 209 and Radd-ul-Muhtar, Vol. II page 429 opined, though among the Sunnis the presence of witnesses is considered necessary to the validity of a marriage their absence only renders it invalid which is ‘cured by consummation’. A marriage contract, it is stated, as a civil institution, rests on the same footing as other contracts. The parties retain their personal rights against each other as well as against strangers; and, according to the majority of the schools, have power to dissolve the marriage-tie, should circumstances render this desirable.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>      To use the words of Baillie, marriage, like other contracts, “is constituted by ejab wa kabul or declaration and acceptance, but it confers no rights on either party over the property of the other. The legal capacity of the wife is not sunk in that of the husband; she retains the same powers of using and disposing of her property, of her entering into all contracts rendering it, of suing and being sued without his consent, as if she were unmarried. On the principle of contract of marriage, the author stated, in the language of the law, as in the common parlance, the formal conclusion of the contract is called ‘akd’ conveying the same meaning as the term ‘obligation’ in the Roman Law. In fact, akd is the completion of the contract which commences with the proposal or demand in marriage and ends with the consent.” Radd-ul-Muhtar, Vol. II, says “akd signified both proposal and assent, and that the word means the contract of marriage as well as co-habitation”.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>      On the capacity of the parties to marry each other, Syed Ameer Ali says, “the validity of a marriage under the Mohommedan Law depends primarily on the capacity of the parties to marry each other. “The performance of the marriage according to the form prescribed in the place where the marriage is celebrated, or which would impress on the woman by the customary law of the Musalmans the status of a wife is  a matter of secondary consideration”. Dicey on Domicile stated, it is recognized principle of law that the capacity of each of the parties to a marriage is to be judged of by their respective Lex domicilii. If they are each, whether belonging to the same country or to the different countries, capable, according to their Lex domicilii, of marriage with the other, they have the capacity required by the rule under consideration.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>    Fatawai Alamgir, Vol. I, page 377 says “Among the conditions which are requisite for the validity of a contract of marriage, are understanding, puberty and freedom in the contracting parties, with this difference that whilst the first requisite is essentially necessary for the validity of the marriage, as a marriage can not be contract by a majnun (non compos mentis), or a boy without understanding; the other two conditions are required only to give operation to the contract, as the marriage contracted by a (minor) boy (possessed) of   understanding is dependent of its operation on the consent of the guardian.”<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>    The essentials of a marriage mentioned in paragraph 252 by M. Hidayatullah on Mulla’s principles of Mahomedan Law are based on the arguments made in Moung Kyi V. Ma Shwe Baw (1929) 7 Rang 777, 121 I.C. 718, Gagu Bibi V. Mesal Shaikh (1936) 63 cal 415 and 164 I.C. 957. In the absence of witnesses to the marriage, Mulla says in paragraph 254 “A marriage contracted without witnesses as required by sec.252 is irregular, but not void”. This rule has been upheld in Shahzada Begum V. Abdul Hamid (1950) Lah 773. As regards irregular marriage, Mulla following Baillie, 155 said in paragraph 264(3): “An irregular marriage is one which is not unlawful in itself, but unlawful ‘for something else’ as where the prohibition is temporary or relative, or when the irregularity arises from an accidental circumstances, such as the absence of witnesses.”  It has been explained, the reason why certain marriages though irregular but not void that a marriage which is contracted without witnesses, the irregularity arises from an accidental circumstance. The effects of an irregular marriage may be terminated by either party, either before or after consummation, by words showing an intention to separate, as where either party says to the other about the intention of relinquishment. Even in respect of irregular marriage, if consummation has taken place, Mulla says, ‘the wife is entitled to dower, proper or specified, whichever is less (Paragraph 267(2)). The High Court Division, in the premises, on a superficial consideration of the principles of a legal marriage, termed the living of the appellant and the respondent together as husband and wife “adulterous relations”.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>    Mr. Wadud Bhuiyan, learned counsel submitted that the plaint is totally silent as to the date, place and presence of witnesses of the marriage and the appellant having failed to prove the essentials of a   marriage under Mohammedan Law, the High Court Division is perfectly justified in dismissing the suit. In support of his contention the learned counsel has referred to the cases of Khorshed Alam @ Shah Alam V. Amir Sultan Ali Hyder and another, 38 DLR (AD) 133, Debendra Mohan Rai V. Sona Kunwar, (1904) 36 Allahbad 295, Abdool Razack V. Aga Mahomed Jaffer Bindaneem, 21 Indian Appeal 56 and some other decisions. Under Hanafi and the Maliki Law, a presumption of marriage is inferred if the marriage is consummated from the retirement of the husband and the wife into the nuptial chamber, under circumstances which lead to the natural inference of matrimonial intercourse.  Syed Ameer Ali stated that Muhammadan Law does not insist upon any particular form in which the contractual performance should be effected or that the union should be evidenced by any writing, nor is the presence of witnesses essential for its legality. For, though among the Sunnis the presence of witnesses is considered necessary to the validity of a marriage, their absence only renders it invalid which is cured by consummation. Therefore, according to the author, even if the person seeking a declaration of legal marriage failed to prove it in the absence of the witnesses, if he or she proves the consummation of marriage, it may be treated as valid marriage. “A marriage may be proved directly or presumptively; directly, by means of the oral testimony of the witnesses present at the marriage, or by documentary evidence in the shape of a deed of marriage; presumptively, by statement of parties or by evidence of conduct and reputation. As in many cases invalid marriages are rendered valid by consummations, and as the dower does not become due in its entirety until the marriage has been actually or constructively consummated, the question of consummation forms often an important element in the status of marriage”.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>    Section 50 of the Evidence Act declares that "when the Court has to form an opinion as to the relationship of one person to another, the opinion expressed by conduct as to the existence of such relationship of any person, who as a member of family or otherwise, has special means of knowledge on the subject is a relevant fact". Illustration (a) to section 50 says; “the question is, whether A and B were married. The fact that they were usually received and treated as husband and wife, is relevant”. This section says when the question arises as to the presumption of marriage, the opinion that makes relevant is opinion expressed by conduct as to the existence of such relationship and not merely as to that relationship. It is for the Court to weigh such evidence and to come to its own opinion as to the relationship in question. When the Court has to form an opinion as to the relationship of one person to another, the opinion expressed by conduct, as to the existence of such relationship, of any person who, as a member of family or otherwise, has special means of knowledge on the subject, is a relevant fact. To narrow the ground by limiting it to "opinion expressed by conduct" so far an opinion expressed by conduct, i.e. by evidence of specific facts of the conduct mentioned in the illustration to section 50 of the Evidence Act. When a woman lives for a number of years in close association with a man and their children, who are acknowledged by the man as born to him; relations and persons of the village treated them as such, there is a presumption of legitimacy, if the witnesses prove the conduct of the man and the woman by their friends and neighbours from which the Court can draw this conclusion. It is not for the witness to draw the conclusion himself and to express a mere opinion about the very matter which the Court has to decide.  Taylor in his Law of Evidence says, ‘general reputation’ is admissible to establish the fact of the parties being married.’ "When a person" says Fatawai Alamgiri, "has seen a man and woman living in the same house, and behaving familiarly towards each other as husband and wife, it is lawful to him to testify that the woman is the man's wife". Reference in this connection is the case of Khajah Hidayatoollah V. Raijan Khanum, (1844) 3 MIA 299 and Wise V. Sanduloonissia Chowodanee, (1867) 11 MIA 177. Faiz B. Tyabji in his Muhammadan Law, in Chapter ‘Proof and Presumption of Marriage’ in paragraph 81 stated: “when the question arises whether a marriage has been contracted in due form, the burden of is upon the person who affirms it; provided that unless the parties were prohibited from intermarrying it is in the following cases presumed that they were validly married, and the burden of proving that their cohabitation was illegal, shifts to the person who alleges it to be illegal; viz. where (1) it is proved that the parties cohabited together continuously and for a long period, as husband and wife, and were treated as such by their friends; or (2) either party has acknowledged that he or she was married to the other (and the other party has been confirmed, or acquiesced in, the acknowledgment.”<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>    There are exceptions to the presumption of cohabitation. It is said, co-habitation means something more than mere residence in the same house. Residing as a menial servant in the house of a Muslim and bearing a child to him does not raise presumption of marriage, or where the relation admittedly began as concubinage, lapse of time, and propriety of conduct and the enjoyment of confidence, with powers of management reposed in the woman, were not held sufficient to raise presumption of subsequent marriage.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>    Mulla on the Principle of Mahomadan Law, ‘presumption of marriage’ has been stated in paragraph 268 as under: “Presumption of marriage-Marriage will be presumed, in the absence of direct proof, from- (a)  prolonged and continual cohabitation as husband and wife (e); or  (b)  the fact of the acknowledgment by the man of the paternity of the child born to the woman, provided that the conditions of a valid acknowledgment mentioned in section 344 below are fulfilled (f); or,  (c)  the fact of the acknowledgment by the man of the woman as his wife (g).” The presumption does not apply if the conduct of the parties was inconsistent with the relation of husband and wife nor does it apply if the woman was admittedly a prostitute before she was brought to the man’s house. The mere fact, however, that the woman did not live behind the purda, as the admitted wives  of the man did, is not sufficient to rebut the presumption. <br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>    In Abdool Razack V. Aga Mahomed Jaffer Bindaneen, 21 Indian Appeal 56, Lord Macnaghten argued on the point of presumption of marriage that if the conduct of the parties were shown to be compatible with the existence of the relation of husband and wife, the conduct is a very good test, and a safer guide than the recollection or imagination of interested or biased witnesses. Their lordships accepted the argument that every presumption ought to be made in favour of marriage "when there had been a lengthened cohabitation, especially in a case where the alleged marriage took place so long ago that it must be difficult if not impossible to obtain a trustworthy account of what really occurred". <br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>    The appeal was, however, dismissed on other grounds as to the acknowledgment of the legitimacy of the child. It was argued that the word acknowledgment in its legal sense under Mohammedan Law of  acknowledgement of antecedent right established by the acknowledgment on the acknowledger, that is, in the sense of a recognition, not simply of sonship, but of legitimacy of a son. Their lordships were of the opinion that the term acknowledgment is used, say, a child born out of wedlock is illegitimate; if acknowledged, he acquires the status of legitimacy. When, therefore, a child really illegitimate by birth becomes legitimated, it is by force of an acknowledgment expressed or implied, directly proved or presumed. The facts are that Abdul Hadee left a will bequeathing everything to his brother Hadjee Hosain, in which he mentioned that he had offspring in Burma. According to one witness, the offspring is Abdool Razack and expressed a wish that his brother should give him something. Their lordships are of the opinion that every word in the will is said about it to be perfectly true, the evidence falls very far short of such an acknowledgment as would confer the status of legitimacy upon an illegitimate child.   <br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>    In Ghaganfor V. Kaniz Fatima, their Lords-hips of the judicial committee said:  “The learned Judges fully recognized that prolonged cohabitation might given rise to a presumption of marriage, but that presumption is not necessarily a strong one, and their lordships agree that it does not apply in the present case, for the mother before she was brought to the father’s house was, according to the case on both sides, a prostitute.”  There is no evidence that the appellant was a prostitute or woman of a bad character. Therefore, the conduct proved by the witnesses suggested a presumption in favour of a legal marriage. <br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>    In Ma Khatoon V. Ma Mya and others, 165 IC 232, a Division Bench of the Rangoon High Court argued that according to Mohammedan Law, where there had been continual cohabitation between a man and a woman, which is not a mere casual concubinage, but a more permanent connection and a child has been born, and where there is no insurmountable obstacle to such a marriage, then the presumption is in favour of such a marriage having taken place. It is further argued that where cohabitation between a man and a woman was continuous from the time when they first met, either through an elopement or in consequence of an ordinary marriage before a moulvi, and that that cohabitation was with repute, it must be held that a valid marriage existed between them. These views have been taken with the approval of the views taken in Khajah Hidayut Oolah V. Rai Jan Khanum, 3 MIA 295. In Bashir and others V. Ilam Din and others, PLD 1988 SC 8, Nasim Hasan Shah,J. argued “Muslim Law presumes in favour of marriage in the absence of direct evidence on the point provided, however, evidence exists to show that a man and a woman have lived together as man and wife for a long time”. The above views were taken from a passage of Tyabjee, Muhammadan Law, as under: “Legitimacy of a child may be presumed where there had been continuous cohabitation of the alleged parents, acknowledgement of the child by the father, treatment by the father of the mother and child, and repute and notoriety amongst members of the family, the community, or respectable members of the locality.”<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>    In Hamida Begum V. Murad Begum, PLD 1975 SC 624, the Supreme Court of Pakistan endorsed the views taken by the judicial committee in Syed Habibur Rehman Chowdhury V. Syed Altaf Ali Chowdhury, AIR 1922 PC 159, and made the following observations: “Legitimacy is a status which results from certain facts, whereas legitimation is a proceeding which creates a status which did not exist before. This proceeding becomes necessary where either the existence of a valid marriage can not be expressly proved or where the child is born within six months of the marriage as stated above. In such cases, acknowledgment of legitimacy in favour of the child may be either expressed or by necessary implication from the course of treatment by the man of the mother and the child, or from the evidence of repute and notoriety amongst the members of the family, community and respectable members of the locality. Such an acknowledgment raises a presumption of a valid marriage and legitimate birth.”<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>    In Khorshid Alam Vs. Amir Ali, 38 DLR (AD) 133, the point in dispute was as to the legitimacy of Khorshid Ali is the son of Amir Ali Mia. Leave was granted to consider whether the principle of acknowledgement of sonship under the Muslim Law has been correctly considered by the High Court Division. In the said case, the question of marriage between Monwara Begum and Amir Ali Mia came under consideration. Khorshid Alam, the defendant, pleaded about the legal marriage. This Division though noticed  that the defendant failed to prove marriage but taking consideration of the doctrine of acknowledgment of sonship held that there was legal marriage between  Monwara Begum and Amir Ali Mia and that once acknowledgment of parentage is established, the marriage will be held proved. In that case this Division considered a decision of the Privy Council in 56 I.A.201 wherein it was argued that ‘until the claimant establishes his acknowledgment the onus is on him to prove marriage. Once he establishes an acknowledgment the onus is on those who deny a marriage to negative it in fact.’ The plaintiff denied the existence of the marriage and this Division shifted the onus upon the plaintiff to prove that there was no marriage. This Division concluded its opinion with the observation that “the person who deny it (marriage) will have to be established. In other words, it was for the plaintiff to prove that there was no marriage with Monwara Begum as alleged”. I fail to understand why Mr. Bhuiyan has referred this decision which rather supports the case of the appellant.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>    In Masit-un-Nissa V. Pathani, XXVI All 295, referred by Mr. Bhuiyan, the suit was brought to recover joint possession of a share in the property of a deceased Muslim, Wazir Muhammad Khan, who was alleged by the plaintiff Pathani to have been her husband, the father of her children, and for mesne profits. The defendants who are wife and her son resisted the claim. The trial Court decreed the suit. The Allahabad High Court reversed the judgment of the trial Court following a dictum of the Privy Council that in the co-habitation there must be a treatment tantamount to acknowledgment of the fact of marriage and the legitimacy of the children and that there is no evidence in the case upon which it can be inferred that the fact of Pathani’s marriage or her children’s legitimacy. Therefore, this case is quite distinguishable.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>    The recognized custom of all sects are that a marriage is solemnized by a person conversant with the requirements of the law who is designated for the occasion, the Kazi. Two other persons, formally appointed for the purpose, act on behalf of the contracting parties, and the terms are usually embodied in a deed of marriage called ‘Kabin-nama’. Under the Sunni law what is required more is that a declaration should precede the acceptance, in order to demonstrate conclusively the intention of the parties. A marriage contracted without witnesses in invalid. But a marriage contracted at a place where compliance with it is impracticable, the marriage would not be void on that ground. Where it is possible to obtain testimony, and the ceremony of marriage has gone through without the presence of witnesses to attest its performance, it may be declared to be invalid. The condition of testimony, therefore, is not so essential that it can not be dispensed with. Once the marriage is consummated and the parties have cohabited, the contractual defect is removed; and the marriage is declared to be legitimate.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong>    A marriage may also be proved presumptively by general conduct of the parties over which I have discussed above. The sources of presumptions of fact are, (i) the common course of natural events, (ii) the common course of human conduct, and (iii) the common course of public and private business. When a presumption operates in favour of a party, the burden of proof is on the opponent and when a burden of proof is on a party, there is a presumption operating in favour of the opponent. A presumption of fact is a rule of law that a fact otherwise doubtful may be inferred from a fact which is proved. The difference between Hanafi and Shia School is that in Hanafi law in regard to valid retirement has the same effect as consummation in respect of (1) the confirmation of Mahr; (2) the establishment of descent, or paternity;  (3) the necessity for the wife observing iddat; (4) the wife’s right to maintenance and residence during  iddat; and (5) the prohibition by conjunction against the husband marrying the wife’s sister or other four women with her. In respect of above five matters, the rights of the parties would be same as though consummation has taken place.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong>    From the above discussions, I conclude that there are unanimous views of the jurists and authorities that even in the absence of formal proof of a valid marriage, a marriage can be presumed by evidence of conduct and reputation, and the question of consummation forms often an important element in the status of valid marriage. A presumption of consummation is raised from the retirement of the husband and wife, i.e. there should be no third person at the place and that the place should not be a public one, like a public bath, public road, a mosque etc. Where there has been prolonged and continuous cohabitation as husband and wife, in the absence of direct proof a presumption arises that there was a valid marriage. The law permits no specific ceremony for the contractual performance of a marriage: and no religions rites are necessary for contracting a valid marriage. There are even opinions that a marriage may be constituted without any ceremonial and even in the absence of direct proof, indirect proof might suffice. The High Court Division, in the premises, erred in holding that mere living together as husband and wife did not bring it within the bound of marriage. Apart from acknowledgment by either party, if there is continual cohabitation between a man and woman as husband and wife, there is presumptive marriage and legitimacy provided that the parties were not prohibited from intermarrying.<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong>    As regards the submission that the plaint is silent regarding the date, the place and the presence of witnesses of the marriage, it is too late in the day to examine and reopen the findings of fact arrived at by the Courts below on a fresh assessment of the pleadings and the evidence by this Division. As the ultimate Court in the land, this Division, as a rule, should give due weight and consideration to the opinions of the courts below, in particular, to the opinion of the trial Court which had the advantage of observing the veracity of the witnesses and watching their demeanour. We find that the High Court Division has totally overlooked the presumption of a muslim marriage and relying upon paragraph 252 of Mulla’s Mohammedan Law disbelieved the appellant’s claim of marriage. If the High Court Division had considered paragraphs 254 and 268 of Mulla’s Mohammedan Law, its decision would have been otherwise. The High Court Division based its decision on piecemeal consideration of Mulla’s Mohammedan Law and arrived at a decision which is not supported by any of the authors of Mohammedan Law. It has tried to apply a doctrine of Muslim Marriage against the established schools of Mohammedan Law. Therefore, the decision of the High Court Division is based on a misconception of the basic principles of Mohammedan Law and thus the interference of the judgments of the Courts below is an error of law apparent on the face of the record. The evidence on record sufficiently proved that there was existence of legal marriage between the appellant and respondent.  The High Court Division, in the premises, exceeded its power in interfering with the concurrent findings of fact in the absence of any misreading or non-consideration of the evidence on record. Accordingly, we find merit in contention of Dr. Rabia Bhuiyan. The appeal is, therefore, allowed with costs of Tk.10,000/-.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

DABIRUSH-SHAN, J:</u></strong><br/> <br/><strong>1.</strong>         This rule at the instance of accused-petitioner Shamsul Alam Golap alias Shamsul Alam Golap under Section 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was issued on 17-7-2011 calling upon the opposite party to show cause as to why the accused-petitioner should not be enlarged on bail in M.G.R.Case No. 151 of 2010 arising out of Motihar P.S. Case.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong>         The short fact of the F.I.R. case is that on 9.2.2010 one Majedul Islam Apu, General Secretary, Bangladesh Chhatra League, Rajshahi University Unit lodged the First Information Report with the Motihar Police Station against 35 accused-persons named in the F.I.R. along with 15/20 unknown persons. The said F.I.R. was recorded as Motihar P.S. Case No.05 dated 9-2-2010 under Sections 148/ 44/324/325/356/ 307/302/ 201/114/34 of the Penal Code and also Section 3 of the Explosive Substance Act. The contention of the F.I.R is that on 9-2-2010 the accused-persons being armed with deadly weapons like Chapati, ramdao, Chaines axe, iron rod, Pistol etc. entered into the T.V. room of S.M. Hall of Rajshahi University with a ill motive of killing. Then accused Shamsul Alam Golap ordered the other accused-persons to kill the activists of the Chhatra League and then the accused Reza caused grievious hurt on the head of Shafiullah with a Chapati. Accused Sabbir caused grievous injury to the waist of Shafiullah with Chapati, accused Arif injured on the head of Taufikul Islam with Chinese axe and accused Rabiul inflicted several blow one after another on the back of Lutfor Rahman by Chapati and when Faruque protested the same the accused Khaled inflicted a ram dao blow on the right rips of Faruque then accused Mobarek Hossain hit on the back side of the head of deceased Faruque by a ram dao and accused Imon and Saifuddin caught hold the right hand of deceased Faruque and accused Liton and Nazmul Hoque by hitting on the left hand by a iron pipe broke his hand. Thereafter accused Rabiul, Tafshir, Shaheen, Milon, Ahad and Anis broke his leg by inflicting iron pipe blow as a result Faruque fell down on the ground then Shamsul Alam Golap pressed on his right rips by his leg. Thereafter when the general student came forward for the rescue of Faruque accused Shamsul Alam Golap managed to escape by firing pistol and Mobarek pointed a cut rifle towards the general student. Thereafter the accused-persons ensured the death of Faruque and accused Obaidul, Sumon, Gazi, Bappi, Raju, Maruf and some unknown accused carried the dead body of Faruque out of T.V. room of S.M.Hall. At that time accused Ahad and Anis blasted a cocktail to frighten the general student for which the informant and others could not come to know where the dead body of Faruque was taken. After searching throughout the night dead body of Faruque was recovered from a manhole of Syed Amir Hall with the help of police. Thereafter the injured persons were admitted into the Rajshahi Medical College Hospital for treatment whose condition was critical and the informant could recognize the accused persons with the help of electric light. Thereafter police arrested the accused-petitioner along with others on 24-3-2010.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>         Earlier the bail petition was moved before the learned Sessions Judge, Rajshaji on 30-5-2011 who was pleased to reject the prayer for bail of the accused petitioner by his order dated 30-5-2011.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>         Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the order of rejection of bail the accused-petitioner preferred the instant bail petition before the High Court Division under Section 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and obtained the present rule.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>         Mr. Khandaker Mahbub Hossain with Mr. Sharif Ahmad, the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the accused-petitioner submits that the accused-petitioner is absolutely innocent and has committed no offence as alleged. The accused-petitioner has been implicated in this case only because he is the President of Bangladesh Islamic Chhatra Shibir, Rajshaji University Unit. But as a matter of fact he was not at all connected with the alleged murder of Faruque. He is a brilliant student of M.Sc. Class studying in the Department of Genetics in the University of Rajshahi. The learned Counsel further submits that the accused-petitioner himself informed the Police Commissioner, Rajshahi over telephone about the occurrence and for redress. Next he submits that informant is the General Secretary of Chhatra League, Rajshahi University Unit. The occurrence took place at dead of night i.e. at 1-30 A.M. The informant narrated the entire scenario of the occurrence as if he was an onlooker. The facts which has been revealed that there was a free fight between two rival groups of students unit one was Chhatra League and another was Bangladesh Islamic Chhatra Shibir. The learned Counsel next submits that under this chaotic and Aquatic situation it was neither possible nor desirable that an office bearer of Chatra league i.e. Secretary General who was a party to the fight will observe the  entire occurrence as a silent spectator without sustaining any assault or injury or without taking part in the fight.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>         The learned Counsel finally submits that the accused-petitioner was arrested on 24-3-2010 and since then he has been languishing in the jail custody for about l(one) year 8(eight) months but till to-day the police could not submit the report and also it is not known when the police report will he submitted. Whereas the statutory period of submitting the police report under Section 167(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been laid down that the police report should be submitted within 120 days from the date of receipt of the information relating to the commission of the offence. By now more than l(one) year 8(eight) months have already been elapsed but the Motihar Police could not submit the charge-sheet as yet. The accused petitioner who is a final year student of M.Sc. Class, his studies has been greatly hampered and disrupted as a result he could appear at the final examination. <br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>         Under the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned Counsel reiterate that the co-accused who has got specific overt act in the F.I.R. were granted bail by the High Court Division in Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 31031 of 2010, Criminal Misc. Case No. 19257 of 2010, Criminal Misc. Case No. 9845 of 2010 and Criminal Misc. Case No. 20433 of 2010.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>         Considering the whole aspect of the case as well as the legal position of non submission of the police report within the statutory period of 120 days, the accused-petitioner is entitled to go on bail.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>         Mr. Mahbubey Alam, learned Attorney General with Mr Biswajil Deb Nath, the learned Deputy  Attorney General appearing on behalf of the state opposes the prayer for bail vehemently and submits that it was a very sensational case with a gruesome murder and it was a fight between two rival groups of students of Rajshaji University which created a sensation all over the country and has got a serious impact in the society. Next he submits that there is specific allegation against the accused-petitioner in the F.I.R. that he being the active leader of Bangladesh Islamic Chhatra Shibir   who passed the order for killing the activities of Chhatra League and also he actively took part in the occurrence. He pressed the rips of deceased Faruque by his leg to ensure his death. He also opened blank fire by a pistol to terrify the talented and brilliant general student. The learned Attorney General further submits that in reply to the submission of the learned Counsel for the accused-petitioner in respect of section 167(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure no doubt this section is an enabling power to grant bail to an accused but this is not a mandatory but directory provision of law.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>       In this backdrop of the case where a heinous crime has been committed under the active role and participation of the accused-petitioner he should not be granted bail only on the score of mere non submission of police report within the time limit. The learned Attorney General in support of his contention referred the case of Major (Retd.) M. Khairuzzaman -Vs- The State which was reported in 3 B.L.C-344 and another decision referred by the learned Attorney General in the case of Anwar Hossain (Md) -Vs- The State reported in 48 D.L.R-276 wherein it has been held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"The fixation of the period of investigation is meant for speedy trial of the case and to save the accused from unnecessary harassment in jail custody. But this provision is directory and not mandatory- on the expiry of the period for investigation the accused cannot claim bail as a matter of right."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>11.</strong>       In the case of Major (Retd.) M. Khairuzzaman -Vs- The State, wherein it is held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"Although Section 167(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure enjoins that if investigation is not concluded within 120 days from the date of receipt of the information relating to commission of the offence, the Court, if satisfied, can release the accused-person on bail but he cannot claim such bail as a matter of right when the delay, in the face of peculiar circumstances, in completion of investig-ation of the case is no ground to release the accused-petitioner on bail".</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>12.</strong>       The learned Counsel finally submits that in this back ground of the case and also the legal position the accused-petitioner should not be allowed to go on bail and if he is granted bail in that case again he will create commotion in the University Campus.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>       Heard the learned Counsel for the accused-petitioner as well as the learned Attorney General for the state. Perused the F.I.R., record and other connected papers. It appears from the record that the accused-petitioner was arrested on 24-3-2010 and the F.I.R. was lodged on 9-2-2010. Meanwhile l (one) year 8(eight) months have already been elapsed but the police could not submit charge-sheet as yet. The cardinal principle of law which has been enunciated in Section 167(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure is that if police cannot submit police report within the statutory period of 120 days, in that case accused may be allowed to go on bail. In the proviso of section it has been stated "Provided that for if an accused is not released on bail under this sub-section the Magistrate or as the case may be the Court of Sessions shall record the reasons for it". It appears that this section casts an obligation towards Court for what reason bail could not be granted. In the instant case prosecution could not produce any materials before the Court as to why the Investigating Officer could not submit the police report within the long time of l(one) year and 8(eight) months. If the Investigating Officer faced any impediment to submit the police report in that case the Investigating Officer ought have written the cause of inordinate delay in submitting police report in black and white. But the prosecution could not produce any materials showing what are the handicaps in submitting the police report. In the absence of production of any such impediment before the Court we are absolutely helpless to assign and record the reasons as to why the bail is not granted according to proviso of Section 167(5) of the Code. It further appears from the record and also from the submission of the learned Counsel for the accused-petitioner that 14 co-accused have already been granted bail by the Hon'ble High Court Division and among them one F.I.R. named accused No. 27 Raidul Islam was also granted bail. If the F.I.R. named accused Raidul Islam is granted bail in that case the accused-petitioner is equally entitled to go on bail. The decision cited by the learned Attorney General in the case of Anwar Hossain (Md) -Vs- The State and Major (Retd) M.Khairuzzaman vs. state also leans support to the granting of bail to accused-petitioner. Wherein it has been held: that the purpose for the fixation of the period of investigation is meant for the speedy trial of the case and to save the accused from unnecessary harassment in jail custody by prolonging investigation. But this provision is directory and not mandatory. Therefore, on the expiry of the period for investigation the accused cannot claim his bail as a matter of right. It is ultimately the discretion of the Court which has to be exercised judicially". The purpose of adding this section after the amendment in 1992 is to enable the Court to grant bail of the accused-persons where the investigating officer unnecessarily prolonging the investigation to give harassment and suffering to the accused-petitioner.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>       In the context of the facts and circumstances of the case as well as the legal position particularly the provision of section 167(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure for non submission of charge-sheet and also considering the harassment of the accused for languishing in the jail custody for more than l(one) year 8(eight) months, we are inclined to enlarge the accused-petitioner on bail.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>       In the result, the rule is made absolute.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>       Let the accused-petitioner Shamsul Alam Golap alias Md. Shamsul Alam Golap, son of Motaleb Hossain of Village-Kazipara, P.S. Godagari, District-Rajshahi be enlarged on bail on furnishing bail bond to the satisfaction of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Rajshahi till the framing of charge.<br/>However, if the accused-petitioner misuses the privilege of bail in any manner whatsoever, the trial Court is at liberty to cancel the bail.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Noor Jahan Begum, Head Mohrar, D.C. (North Police) Office, Dhaka lodged a first information report on 17.2.1999 at about 12.50 hours alleging inter alia that on 2.2.1999 her husband Late Nayem Uddin, Office Assistant. Police Head Quarter, D.M.P, Dhaka went to his native village after taking part in the Monajat of the Bishwa Estama. His native home is situated at village Barachalia under Kaliakoir Police station. District-  Gazipur. On 2.2.1999 he started from his home towards his office  in the morning, but he did not return home till 3.2.1999 as a result she sent her son to her native village in search of her husband and on that day at about 1.30 hours her son and one sister-in-law and one Sanowar Hossain informed her over telephone that he husband went on 2.2.1999 at 7 a.m. by a Motor cycle towards his working place. On getting  this information she   started   searching her husband. At about 16 hours she got an information from DMP that the dead body of her husband is lying in the morgue of Dhaka Medical College Hospital. The dead body of her husband was sent by Savar Police Station to Dhaka Medical College Hospital and on search   from  Savar  Police  Station   she  came  to  know  that   her husband was killed and with an intention to conceal his dead body somebody have thrown the dead body at the side of Burirtake Kabirpur kancha road. She suspected that co-villager Abdur Rouf Dewan, Hakim Dewan, Samsu Dewan all sons of Sobhan Dcwan and Abdul Quddus, all of village- Barachala might have killed  her husband as they had long standing enmity with her husband. In the last year there was uproar in between them over a Fishery Firm and enmity has been increased and as a result of which those persons might have killed her husband.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>         After recording the First Information Report on 17.02.1999 police investigated the case and submitted charge sheet No. 50 dated 23.2.2003 implicating Md. Abdur Rouf Dewan @ Robu, Md. Samsul Alam @ Samsul, Abdul Hakim Dewyan, Ansar Ali and Md. Zakirul Islam alias Jewel but excluded Md. A. Sobhan. Aynal Kha, Zakir Hossain and A. Quddus from the change sheet.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>         After observing all legal formalities at first the case was transmitted to the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Dhaka, who framed charge against the aforesaid accused persons under Section 302/201/34 of the Penal Code. Thereafter it was transferred to the Druto Bichar Tribunal No. 1, Dhaka for trial.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>         It may be mentioned here that before lodging the F.I.R. one U.D. case being No. 6 dated 2.2.1999 was started on the information of S.I. Md. Kamru-zzaman.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>         Mr. K.M. Zahid Sarwar, learned Deputy Attorney  General while placing the reference before us he thoroughly read over the F.I.R., charge sheet, charge, evidence on record and the impugned judgment and submits that although in this case there is no eye witness of murder, but there is strong circumstantial evidence that the deceased while coming to Dhaka by a Motor Cycle he was seen by Md. Abdul Ali and he saw the deceased standing on the road of Balia Bayed with Rouf Dewan and  Hakim  Dewan and  P.W.   4 Abdur Rahim saw the deceased going towards Dhaka by a Motor Cycle  and  he  saw a Microbus  wherein  he  could   identify  one Shamsu Dewan inside the Microbus and   subsequently during investigation one accused Ansar Ali named a confessional statement. stating that on the fateful day some persons brought, the deceased in a Microbus and pushed him into Sultana Decorator wherein he is a Caretaker, and they shut down the shutter of the Decorator shop and he heard sound of fighting inside the Sultana Decorator while he was standing outside the said shop and after some time one of those persons, who was standing outside opened the shutter and Ansar Ali helped him to open the shutter and they carried the person by  Microbus   and subsequently  the dead body was recovered.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>         In Postmortem report it appears that the deceased was killed by throat ling. Ansar Ali could identify Abdur Rouf Dewan. The learned Deputy Attorney General strenuously submits that in this type of case sometimes the independent witness do not come forward to depose against the accused persons with whom deceased had long standing enmity and as a result the witness who are related to deceased have deposed in this case and for the reason of relationship their testimony cannot be disbelieved. The circumstances which has been proved by the prosecution witnesses, the case is well proved and the learned Judge of the Tribunal rightly convicted the accused persons.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>         Mr. Abdul Baset Majumder, Mr. Minsurul Huq Chowdhury and Mr. Fazlul Haq Khan Farid appeared for the appellants in different appeals.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>       Mr. Fazlul Haq Khan Farid, learned Advocate argued on behalf of the appellants except Ansar Ali.   Md.  Ruhul Amin Bhuiyan, the learned Advocate advanced his argument on behalf of appellant Md. Zakirul Islam alias Jewel. Their main argument is that total allegations against all the accused persons is nothing but a cock and bull story. Learned Advocate Mr. Farid at first drawn our attention to the F.I.R. and submits that the alleged occurrence took place on 2.2.1999 and the F.J.R. was lodged on  17.2.1999. The informant herself is a responsible official of the police department and at the same time the deceased was also an official of police department and there is no earthly reason  for causing delay in lodging the F.J.R. which was lodged after such a long time. In this connection the learned Advocate has drawn our attention to the evidence of the first investigating officer and submits that the P.W. 1 admitted that before lodging of the F.I.R. the informant several times met the investigating officer and he conducted investigation on the basis of a G.D. Entry, but nobody prevented her to lodge the F.I.R. at an earliest possible time. The cause of delay is not at all explained in the F.I.R.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>       In this regard reference may be made to 44 DLR-492, <strong><em>Abdul Latif alias Budu vs. The State:</em></strong><br/>Held: "The court has always viewed First   Information Report with grave suspicion  when there had been unexplained delay in lodging it. It can be presumed that the delay was caused for manipulation of the prosecution story."<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>       Further, admittedly the so called F.I.R was lodged during investigation having been conducted by the police with reference to Saver P.S.G.D.E No. 89 dated 02.02.1999 and as such the F.I.R. which has been exhibited in the court is not admissible in evidence in as much as the same is nothing but a statement of witness being recorded under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>       In this regard reference may be made to 44 D.L.R. 83, the case of <strong><em>Akhtar Hossain alias Babul Akhtar Vs. State</em></strong>-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Held:   "The document exhibited as F.I.R. in the case could not be treated as an FIR for the reason that an information as to the murder was lodged earlier and there was GD entry thereon but the same have not been produced."<br/> <br/>Further reference may be made to the case of the <strong><em>State Vs. Paran Chandra Baroi</em></strong>. Reported in 2 BCR-292:<br/> <br/>Held: "It is now well settled that the first Information Report recorded after commencement of investigation is a statement of a person before the police and is inadmissible in evidence. Therefore, there is no First Information Report in the present case, the same being inadmissible.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>14.</strong>       In view of the aforesaid reported decisions we hold that in this case the so-called belated F.I.R. is inadmissible in evidence and since the earlier G.D.E. has not been produced before the trial court the case has no leg to stand.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>       Learned Advocates for the defence strenuously argued that the several investigating officers investigated the case one after another and lastly the C.I.D falsely implicated the convict accused persons being influenced by the informant as she herself and her deceased husband were officials of police department and one of their relation was high ranking police officer at the relevant period.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>       As regards previous enmity of deceased with the F.I.R. named accused persons, particularly the appellants has not been proved at all and if for argument sake it is admitted that there was enmity in between them but h<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>       On the other hand the learned Judge of the Tribunal without applying his judicial mind convicted the accused persons and he has passed death sentence in respect of condemned prisoner in a case which is practically a case of no evidence and as such they humbly prayed to reject the reference and to allow the appeals.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>       Now let us discuss the evidence on record.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>       P.W.  1 corroborated her F.I.R. story and proved the same which was marked as exhibit- 1.   She did not give any explanation as to cause of delay in lodging the F.I.R. before the court in her deposition. In cross examination she stated that the dead body of her husband was buried on 4.2.1999 at his village home where she met with her brother -in-law Abdur Rahim but she was not told by Abdur Rahim that he saw the deceased before his death. She further stated that she went to Thana after 3 days of burial of her husband but she lodged the F.I.R. on 19.2.1999 (although F.I.R. was lodged on 17.2.1999) as appeared from the case record. She denied the suggestion that the convict accused appellants are not involved with the commission of murder of her husband. In fact she could not prove the occurrence of murder of her husband.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>       P.W. 2 Md. Abdul Ali stated in his examination  in-chief that on 2.2.1999 at about 8.00/ 8.30 a.m. he saw Abdur Rouf Dewan, Hakim Dewan and deceased were standing with a Motor Cycle  at  Baliya Bayed road  situated  on  the  way   to  Vawal   to Mirzapur and also he found one white Microbus at the right side, wherein 5-7 persons were sitting. Near the aforesaid  place there was a decorator shop namely, Sultana Decorator. On the next day he heard that Nayemuddin was missing.  He deposed before the police and Magistrate. He proved the statement made before the Magistrate   which   was   marked   as   Exhibit-2.    In   his   cross examination he admitted that the deceased is the cousin of his wife Hanufa Begum. He further stated in cross examination that there is bus stand at Vowal Mirzapur road, a High School and a big Bazar are   situated  therein  where  good   numbers   of people   used  to assemble. His house is situated on the other side of Turag River at a considerable distance from Vowal Bazar and he used lo maintain his family by catching fish and selling the same. He further stated that, “সুলতানা ডেকোরেটর এক একটি ছাপড়া। ছাপড়াটির চতুর্দিকে খোলামেলা। সেকানে একটি দোকান রয়েছে। খালি জায়ার একটি বড় বিক্র ফিল্ড রয়েছে। সুলতানা ডেকোরেটরের পূর্ব দিক দিয়েও এবং পশ্চিম দিক দিয়ে আবু সাইদ সড়ক দিয়েও ব্রীক ফিল্ডে যাওয়া যায়। ব্রিক ফিল্ডে হাজার হাজার শ্রমিক কাজ করে। রাসত্মাটির পূর্বে যেয়ে উত্তর দিকে একটু দূরে ব্রীক ফিল্ড রয়েছে। ব্রীক ফিল্ড ও সুলতানা ডেকোরেটরের মাঝকানে আরো বাড়ী রয়েছে, উক্ত বাড়ীর মালিকগণের নাম আমার জানা নাই।” He further stated that he never entered into the Sultana Decorator and he could not tell whether the said decorator shop was open or not on the date of occurrence. When he deposed before police he was accompanied by the informant to the Thana. He attended the Janaja of deceased, when he met with the informant and Sanowar Master and the mother of Nayem Uddin and other relations of Nayem Uddin. But he did not disclose the above fact to them. In cross-examination he stated that “আমি যা ঘটনাস্থলে দেখেছি সে কথা জানাযার দিন কাউকে বলা আমার বাধা ছিলনা। আমি বলি নাই। জানাযার দিন ৫/৬ জন পুলিশ ছিল। জানাযায় যারা এসেছিল পুলিশ তাদের কাউকে সেদিন ভয় দেখায় নাই। এলাকার লোকজন পুলিশের সাথে কথাবার্তা বলেছে।” He further re-affirmed that he did not tell the aforesaid story to anybody, although he met with many relations of deceased Nayem Uddin. He did not inform the matter to the Member, Dafadar who attended the Janaja of Nayem Uddin. He made statement to the police after burial of deceased and there are serious material contradictions in between deposition made in the court and his statement before the police.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>       P.W. 3 Md. Sanowar Hossain, the full brother of the deceased. He corroborated the P.W. 1 on ma  material points as regards previous enmity over the administration of locality and fisheries. He stated in his examination-in-chief that on 2.2.1999 about 7.00/7.30 a.m. deceased Nayem Uddin  went  away from his house by a Motor cycle, but he did not go to his working place or his residential place at Dhaka and on getting information  he started  searching for Nayem Uddin in different hospital and lastly he came to know that the dead body of his brother was lying in  the morgue of Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Subsequently he come to know that the deceased was killed inside the Sultana decorator and one of the employee of the Sultana Decorator was arrested who made confessional statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and admitted the   occurrence. One Microbus was following his brother while he was coming by a Motor Cycle. The Motor Cycle belonged to him. In cross examination he staled that Mozammel Hoq is a High ranking police official, who is his uncle. He admitted that he never visited Sultana Decorator. He deposed before the police that after 1.5 months of the occurrence and when he was deposing before the police witness Abdur Rahim. Shahab Uddin, the informant and A. Ali were present. He stated that he told the police that his brother might have been killed by the aforesaid accused persons. He made contradictory statement to the police as regards seeing and hearing that the deceased was killed  inside Sultana Decorator or nobody followed by the Microbus while he was going to Dhaka or he did not tell the investigating officer that his brother was found in front of Sultana Decoration or accused Abdul   Hakim  Dewan,  Shamsu  Dewan  and   Rouf Dewan  were talking wilh Nayeem Uddin.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>       P.W. 4 Abdur Rahim is the brother-in-law of deceased stated in his examination in chief that on 2.2.1999 at about 7.30/ 7.00 a.m. he came to Mirzapur Bazar in connection with his own wood business and while he was going to his father-in-law's house he heard that deceased came out from his house by a Motor cycle and while he reached at Bus stand he found that the deceased was going by Motor Cycle and on his way back to Bazar he found a Microbus, wherein he found Shamsu Dewan inside the Microbus. He suspected that the person who were in Microbus might have killed his brother-in-law and brought his dead body at Kabirpur under Savar Police station as there had been enmity in between the accused persons and the deceased. He also told in cross examination that his paternal uncle-in-law Mozammel is high official in the police department. In cross examination he denied the suggestion that witness Abdul Ali was accused in a arson case. He stated that Abdul Ali did not tell him anything. He also did not ask Ali anything. He denied the suggestion that he did not tell the I/O that he saw Shamsu Dewan. Practically this witness did not prove any occurrence of murder or did not directly implicate anybody in this case.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>       P.W. 5 Md. Hanif Hossain and P.W. 6 Shagor Ali brought new story which are not at all connected with the case of alleged murder of the deceased. They have told that after lapse of 2 years when they were going by the side of some accused persons they told that they have killed Nayeem Uddin and which may happen in the fate of this witness. But the learned lawyer who conducted the defence case has cross examined them unnecessarily, violating the norms of cross examination. The evidences of these two P.Ws. will not help the prosecution in any way, even if it is taken in its entirety in favour of the prosecution.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong>       P.W. 7 Md. Anowar Hossain, who saw the dead body and police took his signature on a paper stating that they were bringing the dead body and also put his signature on the inquest report, so he is a formal witness. He was also cross examined by the learned Advocate of the defence unnecessarily.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong>       P-W. 8 Syed Lokman Ahmed, learned Magistrate, who recorded the statement of some witnesses. He recorded the statement of Ansar Ali. He stated in his examination in-chief that Ansar Ali was sent to him on 4.4.1999 who declined to make any confession but he stated that he could give some information as regards the occurrence and thus lie recorded his statement as a witness, which has been marked as Exhibit-5. In cross examination he stated that the learned Magistrate Mr. Bonomali Bhowmik directed for recording the statement of four witnesses and learned Magistrate Mr. Bonomali Bhowmik also directed for recording the statement of accused Ansar Ali on 4.4.1999, but as Ansar Ali declined to make any confession. Later he recorded his statement on a plain paper not as an accused.<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong>       P.W. 9 Dr. Md. Belayet Hossain is the Doctor, who held autopsy on the dead body of the deceased. He gave opinion that the death in my opinion was due to asphyxia resulting from strangulation, by ligature in neck which was ante mortem and homicidal in nature. The postmortem report was marked as Exhibit-8.<br/> <br/><strong>27.</strong>       P.W. 10 Selina Akter, who was the Metropo-litan Magistrate. Dhaka at the relevant time, lie recorded the statement of wetness Md. Mayeen Uddin. It appears from the case record that Mayeen Uddin was not examined as witness and as such the evidence No P.W. 10 has no evidentiary value in the eye of law.<br/><br/>P.W. 11 S.M. Kamruzzaman. He stated in his examination-in-chief that on 2.2.1999 he prepared inquest report of dead body with reference to Savar P.S.  G.D.  No.  89 dated 2.2.1999.

In cross examination he stated that before lodging   the   F.I.R.   on   17.2.1999   no   written   information   was received by the Saver Police Station. He came to learn that both the deceased   Nayeem   Uddin   and   his   wife,   the   informant   were employees of police department. In the column of accused of F.I.R. form there is no name of the accused and Kabirpur Burirtek has been mentioned as place of occurrence. He candidly admitted in cross examination that nothing was mentioned in the F.I.R. as regards delay in lodging of the F.I.R. and it is also admitted that there is no mention of the names of any witness in the F.I.R. In the inquest report there were names of as many as 5 witnesses but none of them were examined either by him or in the court. He further admitted   in  his  cross  examination   that  on   17.2.1999   he   was appointed as investigating officer of this case and before that he was investigating the case on the basis of G.D.

He admitted in his cross examination that since 2.2.1999 to 17.2.1999 i.e. before lodging of the F.I.R. several times he met with the wife of the deceased, the informant and he also met with the  children’s  of the  deceased   before   lodging  the   F.I.R.   After recording F.I.R.  he did not examine  any witness,  although  he visited the place of occurrence i.e. Burirtek 5 times, but nobody's statement was recorded albeit he met with Chairman,  Dafadar, school teachers and many other inhabitants of nearby place of occurrence and as per his sketch map there are many institutions in an around the so-called place of occurrence i.e. Burirtek of Kabirpur.

Yusuf, Inspector, CID Dhaka took up the investigation on 20.5.1999 and he prepared sketch map and its index and examined witnesses and recorded their statements and visited the place of occurrence as per the statement of Ansar Ali. In cross examination he stated that nothing is mentioned in the statement of Ansar Ali that murder was committed or anybody murdered the deceased. He did not prepare any sketch map of the place of where Nayeem Uddin was taken. He further admitted in cross examination that, ‘‘আসামীগন ও নিহত নাঈম উদ্দিনের মধ্যে কোন বিরোধ ছিল তৎ কোন দলিল ও কাগজ পত্র আমি জব্দ করি নাই।’’ He denied the defence suggestion that Ansar Ali was taken on remand although the court directed him to interrogate Ansar Ali with caution. But he made physical torture on Ansar Ali, as a result the learned Magistrate asked him to show cause by his order dated 3.6.1999.<br/> <br/><strong>31.</strong>       On the other hand defence examined one Md. Akbar Ali as defence witness, who tried to say that Abdur Rouf Dewan went to his village for seeking vote as he was a candidate for guardian representative in the School Managing Committee Election. He was cross examined by the prosecution.<br/> <br/><strong>32.</strong>       These are the evidences of both the sides in this case.<br/> <br/><strong>33.</strong>       We have perused the F.I.R. charge sheet, impugned judgment and the sketch map, seizure list and the statement of Ansar Ali recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/> <br/><strong>34.</strong>       At first we propose to discuss about the delay in lodging of the F.I.R. The cause of delay in lodging the F.I.R. is not at all explained in the F.I.R. or in the deposition of P.W. 1. Here it may be noted that the informant herself is a police official and married lady and it has already been pointed out that before lodging of the F.I.R. She went to the concerned police station several times and met the investigating officer for several times and admittedly none prevented her to lodge the F.I.R., but alter lapse of about 1 5/ 16 days he lodged the F.I.R. suspecting some persons without making any specific complain or allegation against them. Rather a vague allegation has been made that there was enmity in between the deceased and the accused persons which cannot be treated as a authentic ground for causing such inordinate delay in lodging the  F.I.R. It is well settled that in various decisions of our Apex Court that delay in lodging the F.I.R. gives opportunity to the prosecution for making embellishment and false implications. Further the P.W. 11, the investigating officer admitted in cross examination that before lodging of the F.I.R. he carried on investigation on the basis of a G.D. Entry. It is also settled that if any KI.R. is made in course of investigation that F.I.R. is not an F.J.R. at all which can at best be treated as statement of witness under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and it is not admissible in evidence.<br/> <br/><strong>35.</strong>       Further in this case as per the learned Deputy Attorney General there is no eye witness of the occurrence and it is solely based on circumstantial evidence. The learned Deputy Attorney General referred a decision reported in 16 DLR, 161 regarding last seen. We have perused the aforesaid reported case and found it difficult to accept the submission that the deceased was last seen with the accused persons by witness Nos. 2 and 4. The fact of the reported case and the fact of the present case   are   quite distinguishable and further the circumstances which the aforesaid two witnesses disclosed in their evidence in this ease do not create any credence that they have seen the deceased with accused persons at about 8.00 am to 8.30 a.m that is accused Rouf Dewan, Hakim Dewan and deceased Naymuddin were standing with a Motorcycle by the side of the Balia Baid Road inasmuch as P.W. 2 staled that he has seen a Microbus which was standing at their right side with 5/7 persons, but nobody could give the number of Microbus or as per P. W. 4 the place is densely populated and there is Bus stand and a big Bazar nearby the place from where he saw his brother-in-law to go away alone by a Motor Cycle which is at a considerable  distance from the place he claimed to have seen his brother-in-law and it is not a case that the accused persons have followed him with Microbus and abducted him, so the aforesaid reported case will not help the prosecution at all.<br/> <br/><strong>36.</strong>       The learned Judge of the trial court mainly relied on so-called confessional statement of accused Ansar Ali as basis of conviction.<br/> <br/><strong>37.</strong>       We have perused the statement of Ansar Ali which was marked as Ext. 5. We propose to reproduce his statement for ready reference which is as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>আনছার আলী এর ফৌজদারী কার্যবিধি ১৬৪ ধারা মতে জবানবন্দীঃ<br/>            আমার নামঃ আনছার আলী, পিতাঃ লাল শরীফ ঢালী, গ্রাম-চান্টা, থানা-নড়িয়া, জেলা-শরিয়তপুর, বর্তমানে বাহাদুর পুর, থানাঃ জয়দেবপুর, জেলাঃ গাজিপুর, বয়সঃ ৫০।<br/>            আমি বাহাদুরপুর গ্রামে মোজহারম্নল হকের জায়গায় থাকি এবং ডেকোরেটরের দোকান চালাই। মালিকই ডেকোরেটর দিয়েছে সেটার আয় দিয়ে জীবন ধারন করি। মাস দুই এক আগের ঘটনা দিন অনুঃ ১০.০০ টার দিকে ৫/৬ জন মানুষ ভর্তি সাদা মাইক্রোবাস  আমার ডেকোরেটরের দোকনের সামনে এসে দাড়ায়। তাদের মধ্যে কয়েকজন কিভাবে ঢুকে বলে শাটারটি ফেলে দে। আমি ভয়ে শাটার ফেলে দেই এবং বাহিরে দাড়াইয়া থাকি। ভিতরে ঢুকে একজনকে মারধর করে। আমি চিৎকার শুনি। ১৫/২০ মিঃ তারা ছিল, তারা আবার চিৎকার দিয়ে শাটার খুলতে বলে। বাহিরে তাদের আরেকজন ছিল সে তখন শাটার খোলে দেয় আমি সাহায্য করি। একজন লোককে তারা ধরাধরি করে মাইক্রোতে উঠায় বেং গাড়ী চালাইয়া চলে যায়। আমি আঃ রউফকে চিনি। অন্য কাউকে চিনি না। দোনে ঘটনার কয়েকদিন আগে আরছে এই সুবাদে চিনি। তারপর তারা সবাই চলে যায়। ভয়ে আমি কাউকে ঘটনা বলিনি। এই আমার বক্তব্য।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>38.</strong>       In the aforesaid statement Ansar Ali neither implicated himself in the commission of crime nor he implicated himself as abettor of the offence nor he stated that the deceased was killed inside the so-called decorator. Further it has been clearly stated by the learned Magistrate that Ansar Ali declined to make a confession under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure although he was forwarded for doing so, but he agreed to give some information about the occurrence and his statement was recorded on a white paper like other witnesses who made statement before him on the same date. It is curious to us that how the investigating officer or the prosecution treated this Ansar Ali as accused and how implicated him in the charge sheet, as accused and why the Magistrate considered him as witness? On the other hand the learned Magistrate also forgotten that he was asked to record his statement as an accused by another Magistrate, but he declined to make any confessional statement. It was the duty of the Magistrate to send him to custody without recording his statement as a witness. He has ex-ceded his own jurisdiction and he has played the part of the police officer in recording the statement for which he was not instructed. In this regard the learned Judge of Tribunal referred to a decision  of the case of  Golam   Mohammad Khan Vs. King Emperor, reported in 54 CWN, 464 (PC). But just going through the head note, the learned Judge arrived at a decision  that the aforesaid decision is applicable in this case, forgett-ing that in the body of the judgment it has been held that if the statement recorded following section 164 and 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure then only the same is admissible in evidence and as such this so-called statement of Ansar Ali is not admissible  in   evidence inasmuch as it is difficult to ascertain as to whether it was recorded treating  him as an accused  or a witness and as such is not admissible in eviden-ce, as suggested in the aforesaid case.<br/> <br/><strong>39.</strong>       He has referred another decision which is related to Civil Case and thus it has no manner of application in the present case.<br/> <br/><strong>40.</strong>       The aforesaid act is not expected from a responsible Judge of Druto Bichar Tribunal. He has wrongly amalgamated the terms of admission and confession. Where the question is unsettled, whether the statement of Ansar Ali was recorded as a witness or an accused, even then the learned Judge based his judgment on the so-called statement of Ansar Ali treating it as confession of an accused.<br/> <br/><strong>41.</strong>       We are constrained to hold that the learned Judge having power to inflict even death sentence upon a person should have sound knowledge in law.<br/> <br/><strong>42.</strong>       It may be mentioned here that it has been well settled by the Apex Courts of this Sub-Continent that an accused can not be convicted on the sole basis of a confession made by co-accused unless it has got corroboration from independent source. In this ease the so-called statement of Ansar Ali is not confession at all, rather it is a statement of witness as admitted by recording Magistrate but he was shown in the column of accused as a result the convict accused persons did not get any scope to cross-examine him.<br/> <br/><strong>43.</strong>       We   have     given   our   anxious   thought   over   the-   whole prosecution case, but we are surprised to note that the police personnel’s have conducted a perfunctory investigation and submitted a belated charge sheet under Section 302/201/34 of the Penal Code and the learned Judge of the Druto Bichar Tribunal conducted the trial and arrived at a decision to inflict death sentence to  one  of the  accused  persons  without  proper  appreciation  of evidence on record in its true perspective.<br/> <br/><strong>44.</strong>       Belated examination of witness: The delayed examination of witnesses by the Investigating officer afforded an opportunity of concoction and it makes testimony of the witness unreliable .<br/> <br/><strong>45.</strong>       In this connection reference may be made to the case of the Sate Vs. Paran Chandro Baroi: Reported in 2 B.C.R. -292: Relevant Para-12-14: Where it has been held:<br/>'In this connection the power given to the Police officer under Section 175(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure cannot be over looked. No reason has been given by the prosecution for the delayed examination of these two witnesses. They were examined by the I.O. after 4 days of the occurrence. The delay  in examining them has not been explained. The delay in examining P.Ws. 4 and 5 in the circumstance of the case appears to be unjustified. In the facts and circumstances of the case I am of the opinion that it would not be safe to rely or the testimony of P.Ws. 4 and 5.<br/> <br/><strong>46.</strong>       Further reference may be made to 25 BCR (HC)—216:  Kazi Mahbubuddin Ahamed Vs. the State.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Held:   "Unusual delay cannot be caused in the matter of noting down statement of a person/witness and mandate of law demands immediate recording statements when memory of witness remain fresh as human memory is always fleeting. Benefit of doubt arising out of the unusual delay of examining and noting down statements would got to accused."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>47.</strong>       On perusal of the ease Diary it appears that the Investigating Officers examined the witnesses on the dates mentioned against their names:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">A. Rashim -------- examined on 15.3.1999<br/>Osman Gani    "    "   on 15.3.1999<br/>Abdur Rob      "     "  ------ 29.7.1999<br/>Moksed Ali     "      "—-29.7.1999<br/>Md. Mainuddin           "     "—12.9.2002<br/>Sunwar Hossain          "       "-—29.12.2001<br/>SagorHossain  "       "— 11.8.2002<br/>Anwar Hossain           “      “  — 8.10.2002<br/>MunnuMia      "     "   —8.9.2002</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>48.</strong>       The above chart shows that the prosecution witnesses were examined at a belated stage without any explanation and as result their testimony became untrustworthy and unreliable. Therefore, no conviction can be recorded relying on their testimonies and thus from the above facts this case can safely be considered as a case of evidence.<br/> <br/><strong>49.</strong>       We off and on hear through Media that police by exercising their prudence and after facing long trouble used to catch the criminals, but they used to get bail, even acquittal from this court and the general people of this country has been loosing their confidence upon the judiciary believing the aforesaid statements, specially  made by the police department. But considering the present case  we  arc  surprised to  note  that one  of the police personnel   was   murdered  and   another   police   personnel   is   the informant in this case and at the same time a High Ranking Police Officer is a relation of the deceased and a perfunctory investigation was conducted consum-ing long time and changing Investigating Officers one after another, involved the accused persons without having any materials in the whole case records, but arranged to get the accused person convicted and one of them was sentenced to death.  It is really shocking to us that the police officers who diverted the case by fabricating the facts for facilitating awarding of conviction towards the so-called enemies of a police officials are kept above law!<br/> <br/><strong>50.</strong>       We also find that charge does not contain any essential materials to give proper notice to the accused persons as to what offence they have committed and thus it has caused prejudice to them.<br/> <br/><strong>51.</strong>       We have given our anxious thought over the whole matters and hold that if we allow the reference and allow the execution of the death penalty, it will be treated as a "judicial murder". So we are not inclined to commit such murder sitting on the high altar of judiciary.<br/> <br/><strong>52.</strong>       In the result, the reference is rejected and the criminal appeals including the jail appeal are allowed.<br/> <br/><strong>53.</strong>       Let an advance order be sent to the concerned court and the concerned jail authority to   release the condemned prisoner forthwith, if not wanted in connection with any other case. Other convict appellants be discharged from their bail bond.<br/> <br/><strong>54.</strong>       Send down lower courts record forthwith.<br/> <br/>            Let a copy of this judgment be forwarded to the Inspector General of Police with an expectation that he will look into the matter so that general people do not suffer, as those have been done in the present case, making favor to a police family.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>
