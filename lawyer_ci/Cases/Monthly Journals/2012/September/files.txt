Kamruzzaman, the learned Advo-cate appearing for the petitioner Agrani Bank at the very outset upon referring a number of decisions reported in 49 DLR(AD)-135, 16 MLR-97, 12 MLR-73, 9 MLR-17, 18 BLD (AD)-268, 56 DLR-695 and 8 MLR(AD)-01 submits that the proposition of law is by now well settled that no separate suit lies against the judgment and decree or order passed by the Artha Rin Adalat.<br/> <br/><strong>7. </strong>        Drawing my attention to the provision of section 6 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 1990, Mr. Md. Kamruzzaman submits that the impugned order does not reflect the true position of law and as such the same is liable to be set-aside.<br/> <br/><strong>8. </strong>        No one has entered appearance to oppose the Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>         I have considered the submission of the learned Advocate and perused the Revisional application along with other materials on record. It is found that the plaintiff-opposite party filed Title Suit No.30 of 1995 impleading the petitioner-Agrani Bank for declaration that the exparte decree passed in Money Suit No. 3 of 1993 is collusive, illegal, without jurisdic-tion and not binding upon the plaintiff.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>       Now, the only question calls for consideration in this Rule whether any separate suit lies against the judgment and decree passed by the Artha Rin Adalat. In order to resolve this point certain provisions of law are required to be referred to for having a better view of the dispute in question.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>       In this connection, I feel it proper to quote Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure at the outset which reads as follows :- <br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>       The Plaint shall be rejected in the following cases:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>(a)    where it does not disclose a cause of action.<br/>(b)    where the relief claimed is undervalued , and the plaintiff, on being required by the Court to correct the valuation within a time to be fixed by the Court fails to do so:<br/>(c)    where the relief claimed is properly valued but the plaint is written upon insufficient stamp and the plaintiff on being required by the Court  to supply the requisite stamp-paper within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to do so :<br/>(d)    where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law.<br/>(Provided that the time fixed by the Court for the correction of the valuation or supplying of the requisite stamp paper shall not exceed twenty one days ).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>13.</strong>       From a plain reading of the aforesaid provision of law, I find that Clause (d) of Rule 11 of Order 7 is relevant for our purpose. Since, the defendant claims that the said suit is barred under the specific provision of law as contemplated under section 6 of Artha Rin Adalat Ain,1990. Therefore, I also feel it necessary to quote the aforesaid provisions of law. Section 6 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 1990 reads as follows :-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“৬। অর্থ ঋণ আদালতের সিদ্ধামত্ম চুড়ামত্ম। (১) ধারা ৭ এর বিধান সাপেক্ষে, অর্থ ঋণ আদালতের কার্য্যধারা, আদেশ, রায় ও ডিক্রী সম্পর্কে কোন আদালত বা অন্য কোন কর্তৃপক্ষের নিকট প্রশ্ন উত্থাপন করা যাইবে না।‘<br/>(২) উপ-ধারা (১) এ যাহা কিছুই থাকুক না কেন, কোন অর্থ ঋণ আদালত কর্তৃক বিবাদীর বিরুদ্ধে প্রদত্ত কোন একতরফা ডিক্রী রদ করার জন্য বিবাদী Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act V of 1903) এর Order IX Gi rule 13 এর বিধান মোতাবেক আদালতে দরখাসত্ম করিতে চাহিলে তাহাকে তাহার বিরুদ্ধে ডিক্রীকৃত অর্থের অমত্মতঃ অর্ধেক অর্থ বা উহার সমপরিমান অর্থের ব্যাংক জামানত দরখাসেত্মর সহিত আদালতে জমা করিতে হইবে, এবং উক্তরুপ জমা করা না হইলে তাহার দরখাসত্ম গ্রহন যোগ্য হইবে না।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>14.</strong>       From a plain reading of the above quoted provisions of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 1990, it appears that under the Ain of 1990, if any party is aggrieved by the ex-parte decree of the Artha Rin Adalat two remedies are available to judgment debtor or aggrieved party. One, a petition under Order IX, rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the other, an appeal before the High Court Division. In both the cases deposit of half of the decreetal amount is a positive requirement and mandate.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>       In this connection I must quote a passage from a case of Nur Islam (Md) Vs Agroni Bank reported in 49 DLR (AD) 135 for having a better view in the dispute in question which reads as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>Mr. AKM Nurun Nabi Khan, learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner, contends that <u>when the petitioner-defendant challenged the exparte decree on the ground of fraud his application under section 151 CPC is quite maintainable. We do not find any substance in this contention, for the Artha Rin Adalat Act specifically provides for only two remedies against an exparte decree</u>. It is either by an application or by an appeal; but in both the cases deposit of 50% of decretal amount is necessary. To avoid this deposit, it appears, the petitioner has sought a short-cut by invoking section 151 CPC which is not applicable in such a situation. The application under section 151 is found to have been rightly dismissed.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(The under linings are mine)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>16.</strong>       In the case  being M. Tariqullah Sikder Vs. Sonali Bank reported in 56 DLR(2007)695 also provides similar feature to the effect that provision of Section 6 of the Artha Rin Adalat  Ain 1990 bars instituting of separate suit to set aside exparte decree passed by Artha Rin Adalat. Only available  scope for setting aside ex-parte  decree passed by Artha Rin Adalat in Artha Rin case is to file miscellaneous case under Order IX  rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure  by deposit of 50% of decreetal amount or in the alternative in the appeal as contemplated under the said Ain.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>       As, I have already noticed that in this case the plaintiff-opposite party without taking the remedies available to him challenged the rightness of the judgment and decree in a suit before a Court of ordinary civil jurisdiction. The suit, thus is clearly barred by law justifying rejection of plaint.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>       For the reasons stated above, I am inclined to hold that the learned Assistant Judge seriously erred in law in passing the impugned order without properly applying his judicial mind into the facts and circumstances of the case and law bearing on the subject and the same has resulted in an error in the impugned decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>       In the result, the Rule is made absolute. The impugned order dated 28.9.95 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Barisal in Title Suit No. 30 of 1995 refusing to reject plaint stands set-aside. Plaint of Title Suit No. 30 of 1995 of the said Court stands rejected.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>       The order of stay granted earlier by this Court so far it relates to Execution Case No. 19 of 1994 arising out of Money Suit No. 03 of 1993 pending in the 1<sup>st</sup> Court of learned Subordinate Judge, and Artha Rin Adalat, Barisal stands vacated.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">The Artha Rin Adalat concerned is directed to proceed with the Money Execution Case No. 19 of 1994 arising out of Money Suit No. 03 of 1993 expeditiously.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Sessions Case No. 1494 of 2006 arising out of CR Case No. 3247 of 2005 under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, now pending before Metropolitan Assistant Sessions Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> court, Dhaka should not be  quashed.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong>         The prosecution case, in short, is that the complainant is a businessman; that the accused for payment of outstanding money on 02.10.2005 issued a cheque bearing No. 1526509 for an amount of Taka 2,20,000.00 ( Two lac and twenty thousand) to be drawn from an account being Account No. 1425 lying with Janata Bank, Mugdhapara Branch, Dhaka maintained by the accused; that the complainant presented the said cheque for encashment on 03.10.2005 but returned unpaid due to insufficiency of fund and that thereafter the complainant through his engaged Lawyer served a legal notice on 12.10.2005 upon the accused and thereby requested the accused to repay the cheque amount within 15 days but the accused did not pay the said amount of money. Hence the case.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>         The Magistrate examined the complainant on 10.11.2005 and issued summons against the accused-petitioner under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 fixing the next date on 23.01.2006.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>         The accused petitioner appeared and voluntarily surrendered before the Magistrate on 23.01.2006 and prayed for bail. After hearing the Magistrate enlarged accused petitioner on bail on 23.01.2006. Thereafter the case record was transferred to learned Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Dhaka by order dated 08.03.2006 for trail.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>         The learned Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Dhaka received the case record and took cognizance against the accused petitioner on 15.06.2006 and transferred the case record to learned Metropolitan Assistant Sessions Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> Court Dhaka for disposal.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>         Learned Assistant Metropolitan Sessions Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka received the case record on 18.06.2006 and fixed the next date on 22.08.2006 for charge hearing.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>         The petitioner appeared before the learned Assistant Metropolitan Sessions Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> Court Dhaka on 22.08.2006 and filed an application under Section 265(c) of Code of Criminal procedure praying for discharge on the ground that the petition of complaint does not disclose any cause of action under clause (c) of proviso to Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 and as such the charge is groundless and therefore the petitioner is entitled to  be discharged.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>         After hearing upon  both sides, the learned Assistant Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Dhaka rejected the application for discharge by order dated 22.08.2006 and fixed the next date on 03.09.2006 for charge hearing.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>         Being aggrieved  by and dissatisfied with the proceedings of the Metropolitan  Sessions No. 1494 of 2006 the petitioner moved  this application before this court and obtained Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>   Mr. Md. Bakir Uddin Bhuiyan, the learned Advocate for the petitioner  submits that  there being no assertion in the petition of complaint as to when the notice  for payment of money sent by the complainant was actually received by the accused and as such the countdown of 15 days has not yet been begun for a cause of action, the petition of complaint , in the instant  case and the proceedings suffer for patent illegality and thus on the face of the petition of complaint even if it is accepted   in its entirety, it does not constitute any offence or no offence shall be deemed to have been committed as alleged and as such it would be manifestly unjust to allow.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>   He further submits that  under section141 of the Negotiable Instruments act, 1881 it has been provided that no court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section138 of the act except on a complaint in  writing and  such complaint is to be made within one month form the date on which the cause of  action arises under clause (c) of proviso to section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 but in the instant case there is no cause of action and as such the cognizance taken by the learned Metropolitan Sessions Judge , Dhaka is on the face of it is unjust and as such the continuance of the proceedings of the instant  case is an abuse of the process of the court and therefore liable to be quashed.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>   Mr.  Syed Mizanur Rahman the learned Advocate for the opposite party No.2, on the other  hand, submits that  the contention of the petitioner is  subject to prove; that impugned proceedings is legal and the complainant  categorically described the very arising out of cause of action having no ambiguity in it and therefore there is no legal flaws  in the  impugned proceedings and the learned Assistant Metropolitan  Sessions Judge, 5th court, Dhaka on appreciating the said legal aspect rightly framed charge. He further submits that there is no legal ground in the instant  Rule  by which this court can at all interfere with the impugned proceedings initiated and pending for trial and as such, the Rule is  liable to be discharged and stay be vacated.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>   In order to appreciate the contention of the accused petitioner and the submission  made by the  learned Advocate for the opposite party No.2, let us now see  whether the complainant opposite party No.2  has filed the case before the learned  Metropolitan  Magistrate strictly complying with the provision of law envisaged under section  138 and 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and whether the proceedings under section 561A of the Code of Criminal  Procedure is liable to be quashed. Now let us see the provision of  section  138  of the Negotiable Instruments act which reads as follows:<br/><br/><em>“138. Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc. of funds in the account –(1). Where any cheque drawn by a person on an account maintained by him with a banker for payment of any amount of money to another person from out of that account  is returned by the bank unpaid, either because of the amount of money standing to the credit of that account is insufficient to dis-honour the cheque or that it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement made with that bank, such person shall be deemed to have committed an offence and shall, without prejudice to any other provisions of this Act, be  punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine which may extend to  (thrice)  the amount of the cheque, or with both;<br/><br/>Provided that nothing contained in this section shall apply unless-</em></div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>the cheque has been presented to the bank within a period of six months from the date on which it is drawn or within the period of its validity, whichever is earlier;</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>The payee or the holder in due course of the cheque, as the case may be, makes a demand for the payment of the said amount of money by giving a notice, in  writing, to the drawer of the cheque, within  fifteen days of the receipt of information by him from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid, and</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>The drawer of such cheque fails to make the payment of the said amount of money to the payee or, as the case may be, to the holder in due course of the cheque, within (fifteen days) of the receipt of the said notice.</em></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>14.</strong>   On a careful analysis of section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, it is seen that its main part creates an offence when a cheque is returned by the bank unpaid for any of the reasons mentioned therein. The significant fact , however, is that  the proviso lays down three conditions precedent to the applicability of the above section and, for that matter, creation of such offence and the conditions are: (i) the cheque should have  been presented  to the bank within six  months of its issue or within the period  of its validity whichever is earlier; (ii) payee should have made a demand for payment by registered notice after the cheque is returned unpaid; and  (iii) that the drawer should have failed to pay the amount within 15 days of the receipt of notice. It is only when all the above  three conditions are satisfied that a prosecution can be launched for the offence under section 138.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>   Now let us see the provision of section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act  which runs as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“141. Cognizance of offences– Notwithst-anding any thing contained in the Code  of criminal Procedure 1898. <br/>(a) No court shall take cognizance  of any offence punishable under section 138  except upon a  complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque;<br/>(b) Such  complaint is made within one month of the date on which the cause of action arises under clause  (c) of the proviso to section 138.     <br/>(C) no court inferior to that of a court of sessions shall try any offence punishable under section 138.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>16.</strong>   From the plain reading of the above section it is manifest that a competent  court can take cognizance of a written complaint of an offence under section 138 if it is made within one month of the date on which the cause of action arises under clause ( c) of the proviso of section 138.<br/>        (Emphasis supplied).<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>   From the above provisions, we find the following three different propositions which  have been supported by our apex court.</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">a cheque can be presented for  encashment on any number of occasions within the period of  its validity and  its dishonour on every  occasion will give rise to a fresh’ Cause of action’ within the meaning of clause (b) of section 141 of the  Negotiable Instruments Act so as to entitle the payee to institute  prosecution under section 138 on the basis of the last cause of action;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A cheque can be presented for encashment on any number of occasions within the period of its validity but there can be only one cause of action under section 141(b)  arising from its last dishonour and</li><li style="text-align: justify;"> Only for the first dishonour and not subsequent dishonours can a prosecution under section 138 be instituted as per section 138 (c) read with section 141(b) envisages only one cause of action in respect  of one and the same cheque.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>18.</strong>   Now the point for determination is (1) whether the petitioner filed the case satisfying the provisions of law and (II) whether taking cognizance of the offence in this case is in contravention of law and (III) whether framing of charge and the continuation of the case is legal.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>   On the critical analysis of the facts and circumstances of the case, it  appears  that the complainant opposite party No. 2, Khalilur Rahman as per proviso (a) of sub-section (1) of section 138  has presented the cheque to the Bank with 6(six) months of its issuance or within the period of its validity. As per proviso (b) of subsection (1) of section 138, the complainant opposite party No.2 also made a demand for the payment of the said amount by giving registered notice, in writing, to the accused petitioner within 15 days after the cheque is returned unpaid. Thus the complainant opposite party No.2 has fulfilled two conditions out of above mentioned 3(three) conditions. The third condition is whether he has filed the case within 15(fifteen) days as per proviso (c)  sub-section  (1) of section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>   Since the date of receipt of notice was not mentioned in the complaint petition and thus the cause of action of this case cannot be ascertained.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>   On perusal of the record, it appears that the notice for demand of money was issued on 12.10.2005. It is alleged that said notice was not received by the accused petitioner. But the accused petitioner alleged that he did not receive the notice. The case of the opposite party No.2 is that  the legal notice  under section 138 (1) (b) of the Negotiable Instruments act  was issued  on 12.10.2005 through  registered post with AD; that it is presumed as per the provision of law that the said notice has been duly served upon the accused petitioner but the accused petitioner did not turn up to clear up the dues after getting notice as per the provision of law.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>   The only contention of the accused petitioner is that no notice was served upon  him and thus no cause of action arose in the instant case and as such the proceedings of the  instant case is liable to be quashed.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>   Since the notice was issued through registered post with AD and thus it is  deemed  to be served on and received by the accused petitioner, So it can be legally presumed  that the notice  has been  served properly as per article 17 of General Clauses Act. The accused petitioner no where in his entire  petition  mentioned that  he did not receive  the legal notice. There is nothing  in the four corners of section 138 or of section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act that for non mentioning of receiving date of the legal notice in the petition of complaint, the case will render illegal when all other ingredients in filling the case is very much available in the materials on record. We find support of  above view in the case of Nizamuddin Mahmood vs. Abdul Hamid Bhuiyan reported in 60 DLR(AD)195.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong>   More so  the very correctness of serving  legal notice under section 138 (1)(B) of the act by the  opposite party No.2 and receiving so by the drawer of the cheque can only be  adjudicated in the trial and as such the proceeding can not be quashed  for factual aspect of  a case. Whatever the defence case might be, that cannot be the basis of quashing the proceedings initiated against the petitioner when it is proved that the alleged cheque has been issued by him and it was bounced from his Bank.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong>   In this connection we may profitably refers the decision in the case of Nizamuddin Mahmood vs. Abdul Hamid Bhuiyan and another reported in 60 DLR (AD) 195 wherein their Lordships held “Since the date of receipt is a question of fact to be ascertained at the time of trial,  non-disclosure of such fact in the complaint petition cannot render the proceeding liable to be quashed to the great prejudice of the complainant who is entitled to prove his case on evidence.” <br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong>   In view of the decisions of our apex court, we are of the view that non disclosure of the date of receipt of notice under section 138 (1) (b) of the Negotiable Instruments Act is a question of fact which will be decided at the time of trial after taking evidence and thus non-disclosure of date of receipt of notice and consequently the failure to disclose the cause of action can not render the proceedings under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure liable to be quashed.<br/> <br/><strong>27.</strong>   In this connection we may also profitably refer the decision in the case of Ali Akkas vs. Enayet Hossain and others reported in 17 BLD (AD) 44 wherein their lordship held” the settled principle of law is that to bring a cause within the purview of section 561A of the purpose for quashing a proceedings one following conditions must bee fulfilled.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Interference even at an initial stage may be justified where the facts are so preposterous that even on admitted facts no case stands against the accused;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Where the institution and continuation of the proceeding amounts to an abuse of the process of the court;</li><li style="text-align: justify;"> Where there is a legal bar against the initiation or continuation of the proceeding;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In a case where the allegations in the FIR  or the petition of complaint, even if taken at their face value   and accepted in their entirely, do not constitute the offence alleged; and</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The allegations against the accused although constituted an offence alleged but there is either no legal evidence adduced in support of the case or the evidence adduced clearly or manifestly fails to prove the charge.”</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>28.</strong>   In the light of the above decision and considering the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that since there is no legal bar against the initiation and continuation of the proceedings and as such the proceedings do not amount to an abuse of the process of the court. We could safely presumed  that the proceedings shall not be quashed and the accused petitioner is not therefore entitled to get  relief as prayed for and as such the Rule should be discharged.<br/> <br/><strong>29.</strong>   In the result, the Rule is discharged and the proceedings in Metro. Sessions Case No. 1494 of 2006 under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act which is now pending in the court of Metropolitan Assistant Sessions, Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> court, Dhaka should not be quashed.<br/> <br/>        The order of stay granted earlier shall stand vacated.<br/> <br/>       Let a copy of this judgment be sent to the learned Metropolitan Assistant Sessions Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka for compliance.<br/> <br/><strong>       Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

The paramount object of cross-examination is firstly, to bring out desirable facts of the case modifying the examination-in-chief or establishing the cross-examiner's own case; Secondly, to impeach the credit of the witness, thirdly, the extraction of the qualifying the circumstances of the testimony given by a witness and to unveil all the facts known to the witness, and fourthly, to halt falsehood in its tracks and discover the truth before the Court of law.  In course of cross-examination if it is possible to unveil any fact which supports the case of cross-examiner or an indication is revealed from the lips of the witness or if the witness makes statement inconsistent with his chief, the Court may infer an adverse presumption against the party for whom he has deposed in the case (Per S K Sinha majority view).     ...

Thus, we find that the Court of appeal below on a proper assessment of the evidence on record rightly held that the case is hopelessly barred by limitation.  (Per S K Sinha majority view)....(29)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </em><br/> <br/><strong>State Acquisition and Tenancy Act (XXVIII of 1951)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 89 and 96</strong><br/><strong>(Evidence Act (1 of 1872) </strong><br/><strong>Sections 101, 102, 103, and 104.   </strong><br/><strong>      Since the learned counsel for the appellants gave up the point of defect of parties, it is not at all necessary to dwell upon the same. The appellate court misread as well as failed to consider the material evidence on record and also misconceived the case of the pre-emptor as made out in the pre-emption petition in arriving at the finding of knowledge of the pre-emptor as to transfer in question. It is the settled principle of law that the testimony of a witness cannot be disbelieved only on the ground of relationship if his evidence is otherwise found to be true and withstand the test of cross-examination. The pre-emptor examined four witnesses in support of knowledge about the transfer in question for the first time in the salish baithak held on 20-03-1998 and such evidence of the witnesses could not be shaken in cross-examination. The pre-empees shall be entitled to get development cost till getting notice of the pre-emption application. The pre-emptee took false plea regarding serving notice under section 89 of the SAT Act. The contesting pre-emptee has failed to prove that he undertook development work in the case land in 1994/1995 rather it supported the case of the pre emptor that such development work was done and the shop rooms were erected after 20-03-1998. The pre-emptor proved her case of knowledge by four witnesses and she discharged her onus and then it shifted upon the contesting pre-emptee but he failed to discharge the said onus. The development cost was fixed at Tk. 75,000,000 by the High Court Division which appears to be reasonable. The appeal is dismissed without any order as to costs.</strong> <strong>(Per M.A. Wahhab Miah minority view). </strong><strong>… (39, 59, 60, 63 &amp; 65)</strong><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>Abdus Samad and others vs Md.

Sinha, J:</u></strong></span><br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong>         Pre-emptor is the appellant who seeks pre-emption of a holding claiming as co-sharer transferred by the respondent No. 2 in favour of Sultan Uddin Bhuiyan, the predecessor of the respondent Nos.1-3. Leave was granted to consider on two points, namely; the defect of parties and the limitation.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>     Short facts which gave rise to the institute of the pre-emption proceeding are as follows:<br/>        Elahi Box and Abdul Malek Mollah are owners of the case holding in equal shares.  There was an amicable partition between the said co-sharers. By an amicable partition Abdul Malek Mollah got 13 decimals of land of the case holding who died leaving wife, a son and two daughters. On the death of Abdul Malek Molla’s wife, her interest devolved upon her son and daughters. The pre-emptees’ father Sultan Uddin Bhuiyan was a bargadar under the preemptor’s father and later on under her.  Pre-emptor requested the respondent No. 2, the vendor on different occasions to partition the joint property left by her parents. Pre-emptor’s husband being a Government Servant, she used to stay with her husband at different places and so she could not visit her paternal home regularly. On her request her brother, the vendor, arranged a meeting for amicable partition of the joint property and in the said meeting, the vendor disclosed that he had transferred the case land to the father of the pre- emptees when she came to know about the transfer. Thereafter pre-emptor obtained the certified copy of the deed and ascertained about the transfer.  No notice for transfer was served upon her and she being a co-sharer in the holding is entitled to preempt the land transferred by her brother.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>4.</strong>     The pre-emptees contested the case denying the material averments made in the petition and stated that the land in R.S. Plot No. 7585 belonged to Elahi Box and Abdul Malek Mollah in equal shares and that each of them got 13 decimals of land. Elahi Box died leaving a son, the vendor, and a daughter by the 1<sup>st</sup> wife. Elahi Box’s son, the vendor by amicable arrangement with his sister got 13 decimals of land of Plot No. 7585 in his share, who sold the same to pre-emptees  predecessor  and  after  purchase he filled up the land at a cost of Tk 2,00, OOO/- and erected structures. Pre-emptor was aware about the transfer as she used to visit her village occasionally and as such it was known to her that the pre-emptees are the owners of the land by purchase. They have got their names mutated upon separation of the jama and have been paying rent. The case is hopelessly barred by limitation and also bad for defect of parties.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>     The trial Court allowed the pre-emption and on appeal from the said judgment, the Court of appeal below reversed the judgment of the trial Court and dismissed the pre-emption. The pre-emptor thereupon took a revision petition in the High Court Division which made the rule absolute, set aside the judgment of the Court of appeal below and restored that of the trial Court. While interfering with the judgment of the lower appellate Court, the High Court Division preferred to approve the views of the trial Court on the reasonings that it had the advantage to see the demeanour of the witnesses and disposed of the issues in a slip-shod manner without reversing the findings.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>     The moot question is whether the High Court Division is justified in disturbing the findings of fact arrived at by the Court of appeal below holding that the case is barred by limitation and bad for defect of parties, which are based on appreciation of the evidence on record.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>     Mr.  Mahbubey Alam, learned counsel appearing for the pre-emptees appellants has taken us to the pleadings, the evidence on record, the judgments and submits that the manner in which the High Court Division interferes with the judgment of the lower appellate Court is against the settled principles of law, inasmuch as, the lower appellate Court upon proper sifting of the evidence on record has held. that the case is bad for defect of parties and also barred by limitation but the High Court Division without reversing the findings on the above two counts has interfered with the judgment and in doing so, it has also assigned no reasons whatsoever.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>     Mr. Kamal-ul-Alam, on the other hand, contended that the pre-emptees did not raise, the point of defect of parties at the earliest opportunity; for which, the High Court Division had rightly interfered with the judgment of the Court of appeal below holding that since this point had not been raised, the Court of appeal below had committed error of law in finding the case as bad for defect of parties. In support of his contention, the learned counsel has referred the cases of Abdus Samad &amp; others Vs. Md. Sohrab Ali and others, 33 DLR (AD) 113 and Abdur Rashid Sarker (Md) and others Vs. Dines Chandra Das and others, 58 DLR (AD) 159. Learned counsel  further  contended that the  High Court  Division  is  justified  in  restoring  the judgment  of  the  trial  Court  on  the  point of limitation, inasmuch as, the Court of appeal below disbelieved the pre-emptor’s witnesses merely on the ground of relationship which is not a legal ground for disbelieving a witness.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>     On the point of the defect of parties, the Court of appeal below on assessment of the evidence on record came to a definite conclusion  that the heirs of Elahi Box are admitted co-sharers and that since the pre-emptor had admitted the same, the trial Court committed illegality in allowing pre-emption ignoring the point of  defect of parties . The High Court Division was of the view that the trial Court on consideration of the materials on record came to the finding that the case was not bad for defect of parties and that the Court of appeal below without assigning any reason abruptly came to the finding on the point of defect of parties. This finding of the High Court Division is based on non-application of judicial mind, inasmuch as, the Court of appeal below while deciding the point defect of parties has considered both oral and documentary evidence, particularly the khatians and came to the conclusion that the heirs of Elahi Box are admitted co-sharers. The Court of appeal below further observed that the trial Court’s observation that the pre-emptees did not point out about the names of the persons who have been left out despite that they were asked to supply the particulars in the interrogatories was not correct, inasmuch as, in the interrogatories submitted on behalf of the pre-emptor, it was not asked to supply the names of the persons who had been left out and naturally the pre-emptees did not supply the names. This finding of the Court of appeal below is based on consideration of the materials as well as the evidence on record and it being a finding of fact is binding upon the High Court Division, The High Court Division while interfering with the judgment overlooked the reasons assigned by the appellate Court and did not assign any reason as to the correctness of the findings arrived at by it.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>   Learned counsel for the pre-emptor argued that this point having not been specifically raised in the trial Court the appellate Court was not justified in deciding the point. There is no dispute that the pre-emptees made general statement on the point of defect of parties in the denial portion of their pleadings but in the statements of facts, they positively asserted that the heirs of Elahi Box are co-sharers of the khatian. However, they did not claim that as those heirs having been left out, the case is bad for defect of parties. The trial Court discarded this point observing that the pre-emptees did not supply the names of the persons who had been left out in answer to the interrogatories supplied by the pre-emptor. This observation suggests that the pre-emptees have raised the point in the trial Court, and the lower appellate Court reversed the observations of the trial Court on perusal of the interrogatories. Since there are conflicting findings on the point of defect of parties, the High Court Division ought to have examined the record and resolved the issue on perusal of the interrogatories particularly the lower appellate Court has made positive finding in that regard.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>   The High Court Division observed that the Court of appeal below without assigning any reason abruptly came to a finding that the case was bad for defect of parties. Such a finding cannot be sustained in law. This is not a legal ground for interference of the judgment of a court of appeal. The High Court Division ought to have decided as to whether the finding on the point of defect of party is based on the evidence on record. The Court of appeal below observed that the pre-emptor ought to have impleaded all co-sharers in the S.A. Khatian and apart from that it was observed “আর, এস, খাতিয়ানের নালিশী দাগের অপর ১১। আনা অংশ এলাহী বকসের নামে লিপি হইয়াছে। দরখাস্তকারিনী পক্ষ স্বীকার করিলে ও উক্ত এলাহী বকসের ওয়ারিসানদের অত্র অগ্র ক্রয় মোকদ্দমায়  পক্ষভুক্ত করে নাই” therefore we find that the lower appellate Court has assigned reasons but the High Court Division has overlooked those findings. In view of the above, the High Court Division erred in law in interfering with the judgment of the court of appeal below on this issue.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>12.</strong>   When a finding of fact is based   on consideration of the materials on record, those findings are immune from interference by the revisional Court except there is non-consideration or misreading of the material evidence on record. The High Court Division has no jurisdiction to sit on appeal over a finding of fact. It is concerned with the question as to whether the appellate court in giving a particular finding has committed any error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice or such finding is found to have resulted from glaring misconception of law or there is misreading or non-consideration of material evidence in arriving at such finding.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>   Similarly Article 103 does not give a right to a party to appeal to this Division except in cases provided in clause (2) to Article 103. Normally this Division grants leave against a judgment, decree or sentence of the High Court Division or from the judgment of the Administrative Appellate Tribunal if a substantial question of law of general or public importance arises which may not only determine the dispute between the parties but will be precedent for guidance for determination of similar disputes in other cases. The mere fact that some question of law arises from the judgments of the High Court Division or the Tribunal will not enable a party to claim as of right to appeal to the Division. This Division would also interfere with the judgment of the High Court Division or the Tribunal where a finding is reached without taking into consideration vital evidence or where the conclusions arrived at without consideration of the materials evidence or the finding which is inconsistent with the evidence on record. Apart from the above, if this Division finds a substantial and grave injustice or if there exists special and exceptional circumstances it can exercise extra ordinary jurisdiction for doing ‘complete justice’ in any matter pending before it. This does not mean that in every petition or appeal this Division will exercise extraordinary jurisdiction and reassess the evidence on record as may be done in an appeal under clause (2) of Article 103.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>   The High Court Division should have exercised its jurisdiction within the tenor of law but in the instant case, it has shirked its responsibility and relied upon the findings of the trial Court overlooking the findings of the Court of appeal below which has decided the issue on the basis of the materials on record. The High Court Division failed to notice the settled principle of law and interfered with the judgment of the appellate court without assigning reasons in any manner. In Abdus Samad vs. Sohrab Ali, 33 DLR(AD) 113, this Division Motilal Sikder Vs. Benodini Basi, 28 DLR (AD) 5 and observed   "objection   regarding   non-joinder  of necessary party should be taken at the earliest opportunity  before  the  trial  Court,  because  an enquiry  on  this  question  may  be  necessary.  Of course, in an appropriate case such objection may be allowed to be raised in the appeal. This may be done on the ground that the appeal is continuation of the suit or proceeding.  But there is no scope for raising the question of defect of parties on account of non-joinder of necessary parties, for the first time in revision.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>   In Abdur Rashid Sarker’s case (58 DLR(AD) 159),two  member  Bench  of  this  Division  noticed  the earlier cases including the case of Abdus Samad and observed "we are of the view that objection as to defect of parties is to be taken at the earliest opportunity. In the instant case that has not been done. Moreover, the pre-emptees did not supply the names of the persons whose names he put to the pre-emptor during cross-examination in reply to the interrogatory served on him. Therefore, in our view he was debarred from making such cross-examination regarding defect of parties and he was also debarred form raising the question of defect of parties at that stage of the proceeding after replying to the interrogatory served on him earlier".</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>16.</strong>   In Abdur Rashid, the pre-emptee’s raised the point of defect of parties in the written objection but did not supply the names of the persons left out in reply to the interrogatories asked by the pre-emptor. In the context of the matter, this Division maintained the judgment of the High Court Division which dismissed pre-emption. While approving arguments in Abdus Samad this Division in Abdur Rashid failed to notice the other opinion expressed therein that even if no objection was raised in the trial Court, it could be raised at the appellate stage since the appeal is the continuation of the proceeding. Only exception that has been taken is that this point can not be raised for the first time in revision.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>   What’s more, the claim of pre-emption is a predatory right and that is why, the legislature has imposed conditions for claiming pre-emption, such as, the petition should be made within four months of the service of notice under section 89 or if no notice has been served, within four months of the date of knowledge of the transfer, that the pre-emptor must be a bonafide cultivator and must fulfill the conditions laid down in section 90, that a tenant holding land contiguous to the land transferred claiming pre-emption shall make "all the co-sharer tenants of the holding and all the tenants holding lands contiguous to the land transferred and the transferees" parties and that a co-sharer tenant claiming pre-emption shall make "all other co-sharer tenants of the holding and the transferee" parties. Even if the pre-emptee does not raise the above points, the above requirements of law must be satisfied by the pre-emptor before claiming a right of pre-emption. There is no dispute that the pre-emptees raised the point of defect of parties in the trial Court, of course in an evasive manner but that the trial Court had considered the said issue and accordingly, the point was decided. The opinion expressed in Abdus Samad being a larger Bench, the said opinion would prevail over the opinion expressed in the case of Abdur Rashid. Therefore, the High Court Division has committed error of law in interfering with the judgment of the lower appellate Court on the point of defect of parties.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>   Mr. Mahbubey Alam pressed the point of limitation and submitted that the case is hopelessly barred by limitation. As to the point of limitation, there is no dispute that the case was instituted more than 8 years after the date of execution of the sale deed. Pre-emptor claimed that no notice was served upon her and as she was staying away from the case land with her husband, she had no knowledge about the transfer prior to 28th March, 1998, on which date, the vendor disclosed about the transfer of the case land. The trial Court believed the pre-emptor’s plea about the date of knowledge on the reasoning that there are corroborating evidence of P.Ws.1-4 in this regard and that the claim of the pre-emptees is inconsistent.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>   The Court of appeal, on the other hand, after reassessment of the evidence of P.Ws.1-4 held that the pre-emptor’s witnesses had admitted the pre-emptees claim of development of the case land except the amount of costs spent towards such development, that the improvement and constructions were made in 1995 to the knowledge of the pre-emptor, that the pre-emptor's witnesses being the nearest relations, they could not be relied upon without corroboration by independent witnesses and that the pre-emptor failed to prove that in the alleged salish there was talk for amicable partition of other joint properties, which belied her claim of date of knowledge. The Court of appeal below came to the conclusion that since the pre-emptor's witnesses had admitted the development of the case land, it was apparent that the date of knowledge as stated in the petition was false and that if the pre-emptees had improved the case land after the institution of the case on 27th May, 1998 as claimed, she ought have prayed for injunction restraining the pre- emptees from improving the case land but she did not take such step.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>   Thus, we find that the Court of appeal below has disbelieved the pre-emptor’s claim about the date of knowledge not merely on the ground of examination of nearest relations but also on taking into consideration the fact of development of the case land long before the date of institution of the case to the knowledge of her witnesses, who are none but her nearest relations. These findings of the Court of appeal below are based upon a proper appreciation of the evidence of both sides. There is no scope on the part of the High Court Division to sit on appeal over the finding of fact arrived at by the appellate Court. The High Court Division failed to point out any misreading or non-consideration of the evidence in arriving at such findings by the Court of appeal below. These findings       being based on proper appreciation of the evidence on record are binding upon the High Court Division exercising its revisional jurisdiction<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>   More so, the trial Court did not give development costs to the pre-emptor while allowing pre-emption, although there are sufficient evidence in that regard, which proved that the judgment of the trial Court was perfunctory and the High Court Division though noticed this defect, maintained the judgment of the trial court by awarding development costs without reversing the findings of the appellate Court that the development was made in 1995.The High Court Division having accepted the pre-emptees claim of development, it has impliedly accepted the findings of the appellate Court that the improvement has been made to the knowledge of the  pre-emptor  at  least  prior  to  the date of knowledge. There is thus apparent inconsistency in the judgment of the High Court Division.  In the premises, it is apparent that both the trial Court as well as the High Court Division did not apply its judicial mind in believing the date of knowledge of the pre-emptor.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>   The High Court Division has committed another fundamental error in disturbing the finding of fact on the point of date of knowledge, inasmuch as, the High Court Division did not say that there is no misreading or non-consideration of the evidence on record by the Court of appeal in arriving at the conclusion that the pre-emptor had knowledge about the transfer long before the date of knowledge and that she had instituted the case as soon as the case land had been improved at huge costs. The High Court Division though observed that the point of limitation is a disputed question of fact which can be determined on the basis of the evidence on record but on the other breath, it observed that the question of limitation "hinges on the credibility of the witnesses and the trial Court had the advantage to see the demeanor of the witnesses and as such the decision of the trial Court in respect of such finding should prevail. The Court of appeal below, on the other hand, did not have the advantage to see the demeanor of the witnesses and as such the finding arrived at by the Court of appeal as to the limitation cannot get preference".<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>   The High Court Division gave precedence to the conclusions arrived at by the trial Court on the reasonings that the trial Court was in an advantageous position to assess the demeanour of the witnesses. This finding of the High Court Division would have been justified if the trial Court had assessed all material evidence and arrieved at correct finding after such assessment. The High Court Division failed to notice that the trial Court overlooked the admissions made by the pre-emptor’s witnesses, who had impliedly supported the pre-emptees case of improvement. The High Court Division made further error in accepting the pre-emptees claim of development of the case land without ascertaining the exact date of such improvement, and also without repelling the findings of the appellate Court that the improvement was made in 1995.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong>   Since the pre-emptees came up with a specific case that they in proved the case land in 1995, and since the appellate Court believed their case on appreciation of the evidence, the High Court Division could have interfered with such finding if it had found any misreading or non consideration of this evidence in arriving at such finding. The High Court Division did not decide the issue in the manner it ought to have decided while interfering with the judgment of the appellate Court. This awarding of costs is also inconsistent with other findings of the judgment of the High Court Division, inasmuch as, whenever the High Court Division was convinced that the pre-emptees had improved the case land and spent Tk.75,000/-, the pertinent question which required to be decided was, when the pre-emptees had improved the case land? The High Court Division failed to notice that there is nexus between the development of the case land and the date of knowledge and since the pre-emptees have come up with a definite case that immediate after the purchase, they have developed the case land to the knowledge of the pre-emptor,  the High Court Division under such circumstances was required to decide the point by bringing all facts  in juxtaposition but it disbelieved the findings of the appellate Court regarding the date of knowledge without expressing any opinion in that regard.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong>   The basis of the finding of the Court of appeal on the point of limitation is based on the evidence of the pre-emptees witnesses and the admissions of pre-emptor's   witnesses   in   course   of   cross- examination.  The appellate Court assigned reasons and it cannot be said that the reasons assigned by it are capricious. The observations that if the improvement was made during the pendency of the case as claimed, naturally the pre-emptor would have intimated the Court and sought for injunction against such improvement but she did not take any step in that regard, which suggested beyond doubt that the constructions were made after the purchase to the knowledge of the pre-emptor, appear to me sound. The High Court Division totally ignored this finding of the Court of appeal below.<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong>   In this regard Mr. Mahbubey Alam has taken us the material portion of the evidence of the witnesses.  Khandaker Mahmud Murshed (P.W.I) who deposed on behalf of the pre-emptor had admitted that at least once a year he visited the pre- emptors village home.   In course of cross- examination, he admitted that in 1994, a road towards the western side and a bridge towards the southern side were constructed. He admitted that bharatias are in possession of the shops.  He, however, stated that the bharatias came after 28<sup>th</sup> March but he failed to substantiate his claim. This witness has practically admitted the, pre-emptees case. Khandaker Monjur Murshed (P.W.2) admitted in course of cross-examination that the case land had been improved by filling earth by the pre-emptees and their sons. He, however, could not say the date of such improvement. He admitted that the case land is situated at a distance of 150 yards from his house and that the pre-emptees constructed 3 shops. He failed to give the exact date or year on which the bharatias are in possession. He also admitted that previously the case land was ditch type of land (low lying area) and at present there are shops and that the purchasers improved the case land. This witness suppressed some facts regarding the exact date from which the tenants have been doing business but he has practically admitted the pre-emptees case.  This witness  being  a  close  neighbour  is supposed  to  know  when  the  pre-emptees  have constructed the  shops  and  let  out  the  same  to bharatias (tenants).<br/> <br/><strong>27.</strong>   Munshi Munir Uddin Ahmed (P.W.3) also admitted that the pre-emptees constructed shops. In cross-examination, this witness stated that during the rainy season the case land was under water but it had been raised by filling earth up to the road level. He stated that Sultan Bapari and his sons have been enjoying the case land and that there are 2/3 shops where the shop keepers are carrying on business of cement and selling tea. He also admitted that Azahar has been dealing with cement business in one shop as tenant under Sultan.  Iftekher Uddin Mollah (P.W.4) also made similar statements corroborating with P.W.3. He stated in cross সত্য ১-৩ নং বিবাদী খরিদ এর তারিখে ও দখলের ১৯৯৫ সনের মধ্যে ঘর দরজা নির্মাণ করে।’’ This witness   admitted   the   pre-emptees claim of construction of shops in 1995 and this admission destroys the entire story of the pre-emptor about the date of knowledge. When the admission of this witness was confronted to Mr. Kamalul Alam, learned counsel simply replied that there might be some mistake on the part of the trial Court in recording the testimony of this witness but he failed to show anything that this witness did not make such statement. On the other hand, the pre-emptees have examined 4 witnesses, who have corroborated the case of pre-emptees that they have constructed shop in 1995, of them, P.W.4 is a tenant.<br/> <br/><strong>28.</strong>   A witness is cross-examined for ascertainment of truth as regards his relationship with the parties, the subject of litigation, his motives, his inclination and prejudices, his means of obtaining a correct and certain knowledge of the facts to which he bears testimony, the manner in which he has used those means, his powers of discerning facts in the first instance and his capacity of retaining and describing them.  The paramount object of cross-examination is firstly, to bring out desirable facts of the case modifying the examination-in-chief or establishing the cross-examiner's own case; Secondly, to impeach the credit of the witness, thirdly, the extraction of the qualifying the circumstances of the testimony given by a witness and to unveil all the facts known to the witness, and fourthly, to halt falsehood in its tracks and discover the truth before the Court of law.  In course of cross-examination if it is possible to unveil any fact which supports the case of cross-examiner or an indication is revealed from the lips of the witness or if the witness makes statement inconsistent with his chief, the Court may infer an adverse presumption against the party for whom he has deposed in the case. The functions of cross-examination is to have the exact truth, to ascertain what part of the story is true, what is false and what is left out-these matters may be learnt, by searching for the questions put to the witness.<br/> <br/><strong>29.</strong>   On a cursory glance of the evidence adduced by the pre-emptor’s witnesses as above, we noticed that these witnesses, particularly P.W.4 has admitted the pre-emptees claim that they have constructed shop after improving the case land after purchase in 1995. The pre-emptor’s claim that as the pre-emptees were her borgaders, she had no knowledge about the transfer earlier had been negated by her witnesses, inasmuch as, her witnesses admitted that the case land was initially a low lying land, and that the pre-emptees had raised the level by filling earth and constructed shops in 1995. Therefore, the story of borga cultivation is a myth. Further, she did not adduce any reliable evidence regarding borga cultivation. The High Court Division has totally ignored the admission of P.W.4 who negated the pre-emptor’s plea of date of knowledge and also the year in which the pre-emptees made construction. <em>I </em>The pre-emptor’s witnesses having admitted the pre-emptees case of improvement of the case land in 1995, the case having been filed in 1998, there is no doubt that it is hopelessly barred by limitation and the Court of appeal below is perfectly justified in believing the pre-emptees case of improvement and construction  of  the  case  land.  The High Court Division, in the premises, committed a fundamental error in interfering with the judgment of the appellate Court on the point of limitation. Thus, we find that the Court of appeal below on a proper assessment of the evidence on record rightly held that the case is hopelessly barred by limitation.<br/> <br/><strong>30.</strong>   This appeal merited consideration which is allowed without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><span style="font-size:16px"><strong><u>Md. Abdul Wahhab Miah, J:</u></strong></span><br/> <br/><strong>31.</strong>   I regret that I could not subscribe to the views expressed in the judgment of my learned brother S.K.Sinha, J.<br/> <br/><strong>32.</strong>   Facts leading to this appeal are as follows:<br/><br/>       Respondent    No. 1 as pre-emptor filed Miscellaneous (pre-emption) Case No.7 of 1998 in the Court of Assistant Judge, Araihazar, Narayangonj for pre-emption of the case land impleading the present appellants and respondent Nos.2 and 3 as opposite parties. Of the 5(five) opposite parties, present appellants were the pre-emptee opposite party Nos.l-3 and present respondent No.2 was the seller opposite party No.4. Respondent No.3 was the other co-sharer (the appellants as well as the respondents hereinafter shall be referred to as opposite parties). The case of the pre-emptor was that the land sought to be pre-empted along with other land being in total 26 decimals belonged to Elahi Bux and Abdul Malek Mollah in equal share. There was an amicable partition between them and Abdul Malek Mollah got 13 decimals of land in his saham. In 1971, Abdul Malek died leaving behind widow, a son (the seller opposite party No.4) and two daughters, that is, the pre-emptor and opposite -party No. 3. Abdul Malek Mollah's wife Aesha died in 1973 and the case land devolved upon his son and daughters. The father of the pre-emptees was the bargadar under the pre-emptor's father and later on under the pre-emptor and the other co-sharers. After the death of the parents of the pre-emptor, she on several dates requested the seller opposite party No.4 to partition the land described in the schedule to the application along with other land left by them, but he killed time on this, or that plea. After the marriage of the pre-emptor in May, 1977, she had to stay with her husband at different places of his posting and whenever she used to come to her husband's house, she requested the seller-opposite party to partition the case land along with the other land but every time he avoided the proposal tactfully. The co-sharer opposite party No. 5 lives in Dhaka permanently with her husband. Recently when the pre-emptor put pressure upon the seller opposite party No. 4 to partition the case land along with other land which she inherited from her parents, he was compelled to arrange a gharua baithak at his village home on 20.03.1998. In the said baithak the pre-emptor, her husband, the other co-sharer opposite party No.5 and her husband, the seller opposite party No.4, Md. Moniruddin Munshi (Najuk) Khandker Rezaul Haque, Khandker Badrul Islam, A.N.M. Nazmul Ehsan, Iftekharuddin Mollah and Nazrul Ahsan Mollah were present. In the said baithak when the pre-emptor raised the question of partition of the case land, the seller opposite party No. 4 in presence of the said persons disclosed that he had sold the same to Sultanduddin Bhuiyan, father of the pre-emptee opposite party Nos.1-3. On 20.03.1998 the pre-emptor for the first time came to know about the sale of the case land by the seller opposite party. Gharua baithak on the said date ended without any final decision of the partition of the land left behind by Abdul Malek Mollah. Subsequently, the pre-emptor after making search in the office of Sub-registrar at Araihazar and Sadar Sub-registry office, Narayanganj came to know about the sale deed in respect of the case land and obtained the certified copy thereof on April 6, 1998 and then came to know definitely about the transfer of the case land by the seller opposite party No. 4 to the pre-emptee opposite party Nos.1-3 and not to their father by the sale deed dated 06.06.1996 at a price of taka 15,000.00. The deed was registered in the office of Sub-registrar, Araihazar being deed No.2946; the registration of the deed was complete as per the provision of the Registration Act, the same having been recorded in book No.l, volume No.36. Before transfer, the seller opposite party No. 4 did not give any notice either to the pre-emptor or to opposite party No. 5 either in writing or verbally. Had the pre-emptor any knowledge about the transfer of the case land, she would definitely purchase the same. The seller opposite party was owner of the half of 13 decimals of land and the rest half was owned by the pre-emptor and opposite party No.5, but he transferred the entire case land secretly just to deprive the pre-emptor of her right of pre-emption. The pre-emptor is a co-sharer by inheritance in the case land, on the other hand, the pre-emptees are strangers therein and as such, the pre-emptor is entitled to pre-empt the case land and filed the application for pre-emption within 4(four) months from the date of knowledge of the transfer in question.<br/> <br/><strong>33.</strong>   The miscellaneous case was contested by pre-emptee opposite party No. 3 by filing a written objection denying the material averments made in the application and stating, <em>inter alia, </em>that the land of S.A. plot No.2901 and R.S. Plot <em>No.7585 </em>belonged to Elahi Box and Abdul Malek Mollah in equal share. By amicable partition each of them got 13 decimals of land in their respective share and they possessed the same accordingly and in the R.S. khatian, the land of the case plot was recorded in eight annas share each in the name of Elahi Box and Abdul Malek Mollah; while Abdul Malek Mollah had been in possession of 13 decimals of land of the case plot, he died leaving behind a son (Opposite Party No. 4) by the first wife and a daughter by the second wife. By amicable settlement amongst the heirs of said Abdul Malek Mollah opposite party No.4 got 13 decimals of land of the case plot in his share and while he had been in possession thereof sold the same to opposite party Nos.1-3 by a kabala dated 06.06.1990 being kabala No.2946 and handed over possession of the same to them and since then they have been in possession thereof. After purchase, the opposite party Nos.1-3 had been cultivating the case land for 4 (four) years and then in 1994 raised the same by bringing earth by truck from Gazipur and Manoharer chak. On the raised land, the pre-emptees erected 4 (four) shop rooms. Of the 4 (four) shops one is two storied with pucca bhiti and tin roof and tin fencing, 3(three) other shops are with Dochala tin roof with tin fencing. There are also 4 (four) 1 (one) chala chhapra ghar and the pre-emptees have been possessing the case land by letting out the shops to the tenants. Moniruddin is the elder brother-in-law (husband’s elder brother) of the pre-emptor and Amajad, son of Moniruddin along with his partner Khokan used to deal in electric goods and power loom parts in a shop in the case land by taking the same on rental basis. The pre-emptor and the pre-emptees are of the same village. The houses of the father-in-law of the pre-emptor and her brother are in the same village and although the pre-emptor used to live with her husband at his place of posting, she used to come to the village to represent her husband once or twice a year and to look after her in-laws. The pre-emptor knew about the ownership of pre-emptees <em>as </em>well as the fact of development of the case land and erection of the shop rooms therein. At the time of purchase of the case land by the pre-emptees, they served notice upon the pre-emptor and she was aware of the notice and the sale. Before transferring the case land, the seller-opposite party also intimated the pre-emptor about the transfer in question and told her to purchase the case land, but she refused to purchase the same, then he was compelled to sell the case land to the pre-emptees. After purchase, the pre-emptees got their names mutated and paid rents. The pre-emptees spent about taka 3 (three) lakh in filling the land and taka 2 (two) lakh in erecting the shops in the case land. The pre-emptor having filed the case after 8 (eight) years from the date of transfer was not entitled to get any relief and the pre-emption application was liable to be rejected.<br/> <br/><strong>34.</strong>   During trial on behalf of the pre-emptor 4(four) witnesses were examined. Of the 4(four) witnesses, P.W.I is the husband of the pre-emptor. On behalf of contesting pre-emptee opposite party No. 3, 6(six) witnesses were examined including himself. The learned Assistant Judge by his order dated 17.06.1999 allowed the pre-emption application on the clear finding that the pre-emptor was an admitted co-sharer in the case holding; there was no defect of party and the application was filed within 4 (four) months from the date of knowledge of the transfer in question on 20<sup>th</sup> March, 1998 in the salish baithak wherein the seller opposite party disclosed that he had sold the land to the father of the pre-emptees.<br/> <br/><strong>35.</strong>   Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the order passed by the learned Assistant Judge, Araihazar, Narayanganj, the pre-emptee opposite party No.3 filed Miscellaneous Appeal No.33 of 1999 before the District Judge, Narayangonj and the learned Subordinate Judge who heard the appeal by his judgment and order dated 29.10.2000 allowed the same and set aside the order passed by the learned Assistant Judge holding that the pre-emption application was bad for defect of party and was barred by limitation as the same was filed after long 8 (eight) years from the date of the kabala under pre-emption.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>36.</strong>   Against the judgment and order of the appellate Court, the pre-emptor respondent filed Civil Revision No.5935 of 2000 before the High Court Division. A single Bench of the High Court Division after hearing the civil revision by judgment and order dated 25.01.2003 made the Rule absolute, set aside the judgment and order of the appellate Court and restored those of the learned Assistant Judge. Against the said judgment and order the pre-emptee appellants filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 556 of 2003 before this Division and leave was granted to consider the submission of the learned Counsel for the appellants that</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"there being no misreading o£ </em><em>evidence, misconstruction of </em><em>document and non-consideration of </em><em>any materials by the court of appeal below, the High Court </em><em>Division erred in setting aside the </em><em>judgment of the court of appeal </em><em>below. He also submits that the </em><em>reasons given by the High Court </em><em>Division for restoring the judgment </em><em>of the trial court is not tenable </em><em>in law and the court of appeal </em><em>below having not committed any </em><em>error of law resulting in an error </em><em>in the decision occasioning failure </em><em>of justice, the High Court Division </em><em>erred in law in setting aside the </em><em>said judgment. The learned Counsel lastly submits that there being no dispute that Abdul Malek Mollah and Elahi Bux were owners of the case plot and there being nothing on record to show that their Jama was separated and one of the heir of Abdul Malek Mollah having filed the instant pre-emption petition it is mandatory on his/her part to implead necessary parties under sub-section 2 of section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act and in reversing the finding of the Court of appeal below on that point the High Court Division has not taken into consideration the aforesaid provisions of law."</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>37.</strong>   Mr. Mahbubey Alam,  learned Counsel,  appearing for the appellants although initially tried to argue the point as to the defect of party in the pre­emption application, subsequently he gave up the point and mainly argued the point of limitation with all force at his command supporting the judgment of the appellate Court on the point.<br/> <br/><strong>38.</strong>   Mr. Kamal ul Alam, learned Counsel, appearing for the pre-emptor respondent, on the other hand, supported the finding given by the learned Assistant Judge on the point of limitation as endorsed by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/><strong>39.</strong>   Since the learned Counsel for the appellants gave up the point of defect of party, <em>I </em>do not consider it at all necessary to dwell upon the same. However, it would suffice to say that admittedly the case land along with other land belonged to 2 (two) brothers, Abdul Malek Mol.lah and Elahi Box, the sons of late Karim Box and as per the admitted case of both the parties by an amicable partition the case land fell in the saham of Abdul Malek Mollah who died leave behind a widow, one son (the seller opposite party No.4) and two daughters, one being the pre-emptor and the other being opposite party No.5 (respondent No.3 herein). Thus, Elahi Box and his heirs had no subsisting interest in the case land. The Statute, namely, section 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 (the Act) has given, <em>a </em>co-sharer tenant of a holding the right of prior purchase of a portion or share of a holding within 4(four) months of the service of notice given under section 89 of the Act, 1950, or if no notice has been served under section 89 of the Act within 4 (four)  months of the date of knowledge of the transfer. In the instant case, the pre-emptor is an admitted  co-sharer  in  the  case  holding.  The appellate  Court  also  has  not  given  any  finding  adverse to the pre-emptor's right of co-sharership by inheritance in the case holding. Therefore, the only question to be decided in this appeal is as to whether  the  appellate  Court  was  justified  in rejecting the pre-emption application on the ground of limitation and whether the High Court Division was correct in setting aside the judgment and order of the appellate Court and restoring those of the trial Court.<br/> <br/><strong>40.</strong>   From the leave granting order it is apparent that leave was granted in a very wide compass to examine the submission made by the learned Counsel for the appellants that there being no misreading of evidence,  misconstruction  of  document  and  non-consideration  of any materials  by the  Court of appeal below,  the  High Court  Division erred in setting aside the "judgment of the Court of appeal", I consider it necessary to see the pleading of the respective parties as well as the evidence adduced by them in support of their respective cases on the question of limitation.<br/> <br/><strong>41.</strong>   As already stated hereinbefore, the specific case of the pre-emptor was that she being the daughter of Abdul Malek Mollah, the owner of the case land had been  pursuing, the seller opposite party who had been enjoying and possessing the case land along with other land left by her parents to partition the same but he was not giving her dueshare and eventually a salish baithak was called for the purpose at the house of the seller on 20<sup>th</sup>. March, 1998 wherein he, for the first time, disclosed that he had sold case land to Sultanuddin Bhuiyan, the father of pre-emptees and then after obtaining the certified copy of the kabala under pre-emption on 06.04.1998 came to know definitely that the seller opposite party No.4 transferred the case land not to Sultanuddin Bhuiyan but to his sons, pre-emptee opposite party Nos.1-3 by a kabala registered on 06.06.1999 in the office of Sub-registrar, Araihazar, Narayangonj being kabala No.2946 at a price of TK.5,000.00. The kabala was registered under section 60 of the Registration Act on 09.09.1999 and then filed the pre-emption case in question on 27.05.1998 well ahead of the period of limitation. The further specific case of the pre-emptor was that before 20<sup>th</sup> of March, 1998 she had no knowledge about the transfer of the case land. It was also the definite case of the pre-emptor that no notice under 89 of the Act, 1950 was served upon her before the transfer of the case land. As against the said .case of the pre-emptor, the pre-emptee's case was that written notice was served upon the pre-emptor before the transfer of the case land. Further case of the pre-emptee was that the house of the pre-emptor's husband is in the same village and she used to visit her husband's house oft and often to look  after  her  in-laws,  so  she  knew  about  the transfer in question. It was also the case of the pre-emptee that after purchase of the case land in 1990 they had been cultivating the case land for 4 (four) years and then in 1994 raised the land by bringing earth from Gazipura and Monoharer chak by truck and then constructed 4 (four) shop rooms of which one is two storied with tin roof and pucca bhiti and tin fencing and 4 (four) others are tin chhapra (one chala) and since then they have been possessing the shop rooms by letting out the same to the tenants.<br/> <br/><strong>42.</strong>   Now let us see how far the parties could prove their respective cases. Pre-emptor examined 4 (four) witnesses. Of them, PW-1, Khandaker Mahmud Morshed is the husband of the pre-emptor and he deposed on her behalf. PW1 in his examination-in-chief categorically asserted the case as to the date of knowledge of the pre-emptor on  20<sup>th</sup> of March, 1998 about the transfer in question as well as the taking of certified copy of the kabala on 06.04.1990 whichwas filed and proved as exhibit-11.  PW-1 further asserted that salish baithak took place on the said date due to the fact that in spite of the request by the pre-emptor to give her the share in the landed property left by her parents, the seller was not giving her due share. PW-1 further asserted that the case land was transferred secretly. He denied the assertion of the pre-emptee that notice of transfer was given to the pre-emptor. PW-1 further asserted that Sultanuddin Bhuiyan used to cultivate the case land as bargader for the last 40 (forty) years, that is, right from the time of Malek Mollah in 1971 and after his death the pre-emptor became the owner, the case land was also used to be cultivated by the bargader and the seller opposite party used to give her crops. He further asserted that the case land was not partitioned among the co-sharers. In cross-examination, this PW categorically denied the pre-emptee's case that the case land was filled up by bringing earth from other place and then asserted that the case land was raised by taking earth from the river. This PW categorically asserted that it was a fact that shop rooms were erected in the case land but those were erected after 20<sup>th</sup> of March,1998.He also asserted that there are tenants in the case land, but after 20<sup>th</sup> of March, 1998. This PW also denied the suggestion given to him on behalf of the pre-emptee that Azad, son of Khandker Monjer Morshed, the pre-emptor's elder brother-in-law did business in a shop of the case land along with Khokon (OPW4). He denied the further suggestion that no 'baithakh' took place on 20<sup>th</sup> of March, 1998 and the seller opposite party was not present in the baithak. PW1 further asserted that they knew that the pre-emptees had been in possession of the case land as the bargader. The pre-emptee by cross-examining PW1 could not at all shake his testimony as to the knowledge of the transfer in question having been disclosed by the seller opposite party for the first time in the salish baithak held on 20<sup>th</sup> of March, 1998 for the purpose of partitioning the land left behind by the parents of the pre-emptor.<br/> <br/><strong>43.</strong>   PW-2, Khandaker Monjer Morshed is the husband of opposite party No.5, a co-sharer and sister of the pre-emptor. This PW in his examination-in-chief stated that Abdul Malek used to cultivate the case land through bargader Sultanuddin Bhuiyan, that is, the father of pre emptees. He categorically stated that the property left behind by late Malek Mollah was not partitioned. He himself and his wife requested the seller opposite party No. 4 to partition the land left behind by Malek Mollah but he did not do so and eventually baithak was called on 20<sup>th</sup> of March, 1998 for the purpose. Salish baithak was held in the house of opposite party No.4 and when discussion started about the case land he disclosed that he had transferred the same. This PW further asserted that before 20<sup>th</sup> of March, 1998 he did not know about the transfer in question. In cross-examination, this PW stated that he lived in the same village and the case land is just 150 yards away to the west of his house. He denied the suggestion of the pre-emptee that at the time of selling the case land, the pre-emptor and her husband were present and as they refused to purchase the case land, the same was sold to the pre-emptees. This PW denied the further suggestion that Sultanuddin Bhuiyan was not the bargader and that the pre-emptees filled up the land by spending TK.3,00,000.00. This PW stated in his cross-examination to the effect " সত্য ন্য প্রতিপক্ষ প্রায় ৩ লাখ টাকার মাতি ভরাট করে । ১৯৯৫ সনের নালিশী জমিতে দোকান আছে  কিনা জানি না । গত ৬ মাস যাবৎ বাড়ি যাচ্ছি না। নালিশী জমিতে প্রতিপক্ষরা গোটা তিনেক ঘর  তুলে। ভাড়াটিয়ার ঘর কত বৎসর যাবৎ তা জানি না। সত্য নয় তরফছানি ১৯৯৫ সনে ঘর ভাড়া দেয়।  তারা কত তাকা ঘর ভাড়া দেয় জানি না। সত্য নয় প্রায় ২ লক্ষ টাকা কারন নয়। ১৯৯৫ সনে। আমার  মতে ৪৫/৪৫ হাজার টাকা খরচ করে প্রতিপক্ষ ঘর নির্মান করে। Thus,  from the cross-examination of PW-2,  it does appear that this PW at all admitted the fact that the pre-emptees made development in the case land in 1995 as found by the appellate Court. In cross-examination, the PW further asserted the fact stated by him in his examination-in-chief that he tried many a time to partition the land left behind by Malek, but failed. He denied the suggestion of the pre-emptees that no salish took place on 20.03.1998.<br/> <br/><strong>44.</strong>   PW-3, Munshi Monir Uddin Ahmed, an independent witness categorically stated in his examination-in-chief that Abdul Malek Mollah died in 1971 leaving behind many properties including the case land. The case land was not partitioned before and a baithak took place at the house of the seller opposite party No. 4 on 20<sup>th</sup> of March, 1998 about the case land. When the pre-emptor demanded her share in the case land, the seller opposite party told that he had transferred the case land to Sultan Bapari. Discussion also took place about other properties. He further asserted that before 20<sup>th</sup> of March, 1998 he did not know about the sale of the case land. He further stated to the effect নালিশী জমিতে ঘর দরজা আছে। ঘর দরজা সমূহ ২০/৩/৯৮ ইং এর পর। This PW also named the persons who were present in the baithak as stated in the pre­emption application. In cross-examination this PW further asserted to the effect মাটি ভরাট ঘর নির্মান কোন তারিখে করে তা বলতে পারব না তবে ২০/।৩/৯৮ ইং তারিখ এর পর করে। But unfortunately the appellate Court found that though salish wascalled in writing but no paper was filed in that respect. Thus, it is clear that this PW in cross-examination re-asserted the statements as made by him in his examination-in-chief about the salish baithak. He further stated in cross-examination that Sultanuddin Bhuiyan and his sons used to possess the case land for long, but as bargader. This PW very stoutly denied the suggestion of the pre-emptee that he raised the land and erected shop rooms in 1995. It would be better to quote the relevant portion of the cross-examination of PW-3 which is as follows: সত্য নয় ২০/৩/৯৮ ইং তারিখে এর মাটি ভরাট ও ঘর নির্মাণ  মিথ্যা । সত্য নয় ১৯৯৫ ইং তারিখে পর্যন্ত তরফছানিগর ঘর দ্রজার কাজ শেষ করে। সত্য নয় ১৯৯০-১৯৯৫ সন পর্যন্ত মাটি ভরাট ও ঘর দরজা নির্মাণ করে। <br/> <br/><strong>45.</strong>   P.W.4,  Eftekher  Uddin Mollah,  stated  in  his examination-in-chief that late Abdul Malek Mollah had other land except the case land and there was no partition of the lands left behind by him amongst his heirs. This PW categorically stated that he was present  in  the  baithak  which  took  place  on 20.03.1998 at the house of opposite party No.4 alongwith PW-2,  Khandaker Monjur  Morshed,  PW-3 Munsh Moniruddin  Ahmed,  Nazrul  Islam,  seller  opposite party No.4, his second wife and opposite party No.5 along with others. He further stated that rooms were erected in the case land after 20<sup>cn</sup> of March, 1998. In cross-examination this PW further stated to the Effect মাটি ভরাট ঘর নির্মান কোন তারিখে করে তা বলতে পারব না তবে ২০/।৩/৯৮ ইং তারিখ এর পর  করে।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>46.</strong>   On behalf of the contesting  pre-emptee,  6 witnesses were examined. Of these OPW's, OPW-1 is the pre-emptee No. 3. He asserted the case as made out in the written objection. This OPW stated in his examination-in-chief that after purchase, they had been cultivating the case land for the first 4(four) years and then in 1995 filled up the land and erected shop rooms therein spending TK.5,00,000.00. He further stated that they erected 4 (four) rooms of which one was du chala tin with pucca bhiti and they used to possess the same through tenants. Azad, a son of the elder brother-in-law (son of the elder brother of the pre-emptor's husband) of the pre-emptor also did business in the case land as a tenant under. The house of the pre-emptor and her husband is in the same village and she used to visit the village 6/7 times in a year. The seller informed the pre-emptor about the sale of the case land but she refused to purchase the same. This OPW further stated that at the time of transfer of the case land, notice was given to the pre-emptor. He denied that salish took place on 20<sup>th</sup> of March, 1998 and then after obtaining the certified copy of the kabala in question, the pre-emptor came to know definitely about the transfer in question. He further asserted that the case was filed after 8 (eight)  years from the date of transfer out of greed as the land was developed by then.  In cross-examination, this PW denied the suggestion that they developed the case land and erected the structures on the case land on 20.03.1998. He further stated that আমার নালিশী সম্পত্তি খরিদের বিষয়ে মজহরকে জানাই এ যাবত নোটিশ এর কপি আদালতে দাখিল  করি নাই । পর বলে নোটিশ হারিয়ে গিয়েছে।<br/> <br/><strong>47.</strong>   OPW-2,  Khoka Khandaker deposed that the pre-emptor and her husband used to visit their house at the village <em>5/7 </em>times in a year. After purchase, the case land was raised. This OPW further stated to the the effect ” ৪/৫ বৎসর পূর্বে মাটি ভরাট করে। There are structures in the case land which have been let out to the tenants.He further stated that he is a salishder of panchgram village and he knew Baker Mollah (seller opposite partyNo.4). He could not say whether any baithak took place in the house of opposite party No. 4. Had there been any such baithak,  the same would have come to his knowledge. Thus, it is clear that this OPW did not specifically say anything in which year development in the case land was done and the shop rooms were erected. In cross-examination, this OPW denied the suggestion that the work of  raising the case land and erection of the shop rooms were done after 20<sup>th</sup> of March, 1998 and then he asserted that the work of filling up the land and erecting shop rooms were done 5(five) years before<br/> <br/><strong>48.</strong>   OPW-3, Abdur Razzak, deposed that the case land was purchased 5/6 years before.  Everybody of the village knew about the purchase and the sale did not take place secretly. After purchase, the purchaser used to plant seedlings for sometime and then filled up the land by bringing earth by truck at the cost of taka 2/3 lakh. The work of earth filling was done 4(four) years before. In cross examination, he  stated that he was not a witness to the sale deed and he was not present at the time of sale of the case land. He denied the suggestion given by the pre-emptor that the shop rooms in the case land were erected at a cost of taka 40/50 thousand after 20.03.1998. This OPW further stated that the pre- emptees erected rooms and let out the same to the tenants and there were 5 (five)  tenants. This OPW contradicted OPW s 1 and 2 as to the development of the case land and erection of shop rooms therein.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>49.</strong>   OPW-4,  Khokan Dewan,  stated that he knew the case land which <em>is </em>being possessed by opposite party No.3. The case land was filled up by opposite party No. 3, he has been possessing the same for 7/8 years. Opposite party No .3 erected rooms in the case land and presently possesses the same through tenants. He used to do business in a shop in the case land by taking the same on rental basis along with Azad khandaker, son of the elder brother-in-law of the pre-emptor as his partner. He further stated that opposite party No. 3 filled up the land by bringing earth by truck and in doing so he had to spend TK.2/2.5 lakh and he also spent TK. 1.5 lakh for erecting the rooms. In cross-examination, he stated that presently he works at the colour shop of his maternal uncle. He had no written tenancy agreement with OPW-3 and no receipt of the payment of rent as well. There was no agreement to show that Azad Khandaker used to do business with him jointly. However, he denied the suggestion given by the pre-emptor that he was not tenant in the case land.<br/> <br/><strong>50.</strong>   `OPW-5 is Tota Miah. He deposed that opposite party No.3 had been possessing the case land for 7/8 years. The case land was low land and the same was filled up by bringing earth by truck through him.A sum of taka 3/4 lakh were spent in filling the land. The earth was brought from Gazipur and Monoharer chak. The cost of bringing the earth was paid by opposite party No.3. He further stated that after filling the land opposite party No. 3 erected rooms at the cost of TK.2.5 lakh. There are 3 (three) shops in the case land, one furniture shop, one saloon and one tea shop which have been let out to the tenants. In cross-examination, this OPW stated that he was a man of village Monoharer chak which was 2 kilometers away from his house. He further stated that he had no truck of his own and he did not file any receipt of hiring truck. He denied the suggestion that the rooms  in  the  case land  were  erected  after 20.03.1998.<br/> <br/><strong>51.</strong>   In cross – examination he further stated that এর পাশে লাগ পূর্বে দিকে ব্র পুত্র নদী আছে । সেখানে থেকে মাটি ভরাট হয়েছে । (সে নিশ্চুপ ছিল) পরে বলে তা সত্যি নয় . The demeanour of witness as recorded by the trail court shows that he was a partisan witness and he did not tell the truth.<br/> <br/><strong>52.</strong>   OPW-6 is one Haridas . He deposed that he has furniture shop in the case land and he has been  doing his business there since 1995 by taking the same on rent at TK. 6, 000. 00 per year.  In cross- examination,  he  stated that  he brings  wood  for furniture from Araihazar and Narsingdi. The receipt for purchasing wood is given from Narsingdi but he has not filed the same in Court. He further stated that  there  was  no  tenancy  agreement  with  the opposite party No. 3.<br/> <br/><strong>53.</strong>   These are the relevant evidence of the witnesses adduced by the parties in the case land.<br/> <br/><strong>54.</strong>   Sub-section (1) of section 96 of the Act has clearly mandated that if a portion or share of a holding of a raiyat is transferred then a co-sharer tenant of that holding may within 4 (four) months of the service of notice given under section 89 of the Act or if no notice has been served under section 89 of the Act within 4 (four) months of the date of knowledge of the transfer, apply to the Court for the said portion or share to be transferred to him. In this case, the pre-emptor categorically asserted in the application for pre-emption that before transfer of the case land no notice was served upon her either in writing or verbally. The pre-emptor further asserted that the case land was transferred secretly beyond her knowledge. On the other hand, the pre-emptee in his written objection asserted that before purchasing the case land, he served notice of the transfer to the pre-emptor and the pre-emptor was aware about the notice and the sale in  question.  Section  96(1)   of  the  Act  has contemplated two situations as to the limitation for filing an application for pre-emption, one within 4(four) months of the service of the notice given under section 89 of the Act and the other within 4 (four)  months of the date of knowledge of the transfer if no notice has been served under section 89 of the act. When the pre emteein his written objection  specifically  pleaded  that  notice  of transfer  was  given  to  the  pre-emptor  onus  was squarely upon him to prove the same. Now let us see whether the pre-emptee proved the said fact.<br/> <br/><strong>55.</strong>   Pre-emptee-opposite party No. 3 examined himself as OPW1. He in his examination in chief asserted that at the time of purchase of the case land notice was  given  to  the  pre-emptor. The OPW  further asserted that the seller-opposite party informed the pre-emptor about the sale but he refused to purchase the same. I consider it better to quote the relevant portion of the evidence of P.W.I in this respect বিক্রেতা তরপছানি নালিশী সম্পত্তি বিক্রির সময় মজহরকে জানায় । নালিশী সম্পত্তি রাখতে বা ক্রয়ে অস্বীকার করে। দরখাস্তকারিনীকে নোটিশ দেওয়া হয় নালিশী সম্পত্তি খরিদের সময় নালিশী সম্পত্তির  দক্ষিণ পার্শ্বে আমাদের সম্পত্তি। But copy of such notice was not filed in the Court. And in cross-examination this PW stated to the effect আমার নালিশী সম্পত্তি খরিদের বিষয়ে মজহরকে জানাই এ যাবত নোটিশ এর কপি আদালতে দাখিল  করি নাই । পর বলে নোটিশ হারিয়ে গিয়েছে। Thus it is clear that notice of transfer under section 89 of the Act was not served upon the pre- emptor and the contesting pre-emptee took false plea in the written objection. Therefore, the case of the pre-emptor that on coming to know about thetransfer in question in the salish baithak held, on 20<sup>th</sup> of March, 1998 she obtained the certified copy of the kabala in question on 06.04.1998 and then came to know definitely about the transfer in question and then filed the case on 27.05.1998, that is, well ahead of 4 (four) months from the date of knowledge has to be considered in the light of the evidence adduced by the parties. In this regard, I am not oblivious of the onus of the pre-emptor to prove the Fact of knowledge as to the sale in question as asserted by her in the pre-emption application as well as by her husband as PW-1.<br/> <br/><strong>56.</strong>   From  the  judgment  of  the  trial  Court,  it appears that it considered the evidence of the PW’s and then believed the pre-emptor's case of knowledge about the transfer in question on 20<sup>th</sup> of March, 1998 as disclosed by the seller – opposite party in the salish baithakheld on the said date.The trial Court found the PW’s  trustworthy And no inconsistency in their evidence.The trial Court Court did not find OPW1 trustworthy as he madecontradictory statements in cross-examination from that of the examination-in-chief. I considerit better to quote the relevant portion of the finding of the trial Court about OPW-1 which is as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>অপর দিকে প্রতিপক্ষের সাক্ষী নং ১ তার জবান বন্দিতে বলে, খরিদের পূর্বে থেকেই দরখাস্তকারিনী  জানে। নাঃ সম্পত্তি খরিদের সময়, সে তার জেরায় স্বীকার করে, আমরা নাঃ সম্পত্তি খরিদের বিষয়ে  মজহরকে জানাই এবং এ বাবদ নোটিশে এর কপি আদালতে দাখি করি নাই। পরে বলে নোটিশ  হারিয়ে গিয়েছে । এ সাক্ষী জবানবন্দী ও জেরা মধ্যে সমস্যা খুজে না পাওয়ায় ও এ সাক্ষী সাক্ষ্য  বিশ্বাস যোগ্য নয়।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>57.</strong>   The trial Court found that though OPW-2 in his examination-in-chief  stated  that  everybody  knew about the purchase and that the transfer in question was not made secretly and that after purchase, the purchasers planted seedlings for sometimes, in cross-examination, stated that he was not present during  the  transfer  and he  also  could  not  say whether the people of the village knew about the transfer and finally observed that this witness could not say whether everybody knew about the transfer and then concluded by saying that from analysis of the deposition of the witnesses it appeared that the pre-emptor came to know about the trans-fer for the first time on 20.03.1998. However, the trial Court did not consider it necessary to discuss the evidence of the other OPWs.<br/> <br/><strong>58.</strong>   The appellate Court which is the last Court of fact disbelieved the pre-emptor's case of salish baithak held on 20<sup>th</sup> of March, 1998 on the ground that no document was filed as to the proof of holding of salish on the said date completely forgetting that neither in the application for pre-emption nor in the deposition of PW1, any such case of written salish baithak was made out. The other reason given by the appellate Court to disbelieve the  story  of  salish  as  deposed  by  PW-3,  an independent witness is that except him none of the other  salishder  deposed  to  the  said  effect completely  ignoring  the  evidence  of  PW-4  who categorically deposed about the holding of salish on 20™ of March, 1998 and the further fact that he was present at the salish. PW-4 categorically stated in his examination-in-chief that he was present in the salish along with PWs 2 and 3. In this regard, the appellate Court also failed to notice section 134 of the Evidence Act which has clearly provided that no particular number of witnesses is necessary to prove a fact. Thus, it appears to me that the appellate Court totally misread as well as failed to consider the   material   evidence   on   record   and   also misconceived the case of the pre-emptor as made out in the pre-emption application in arriving at the finding of knowledge of the pre-emptor as to the transfer in question. It further appears that the appellate Court disbelieved the evidence of PW's 1,2 and 4 on the ground that they were the own men of the pre-emptor. Such reason given by the appellate Court in disbelieving PW s 1, 2 and 3 is absolutely fallacious and contrary to the settled principle of law that the testimony of a witness cannot be disbelieved only on the ground of relationship or closeness if his evidence is otherwise found to be true and withstand the test of cross-examination. In this regard, reference may be made to the cases of Samad Sikder @ Somed Sikder-vs- State reported in 50 DLR(AD)24, Nowbul Alam and others-Vs- State reported in 45DLR(AD) 140, and Anwara Khatun-Vs-Md. Abdul Hye and others reported in 4BLC(AD) 14.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>59.</strong>   In support of the case of knowledge about the transfer  in question for the  first time in the salish baithak held on 20<sup>th</sup> of March, 1998 the pre-emptor examined 3(three) witnesses in addition to her husband as PWl. The evidence of the witnesses to the above effect could not be  shaken  in cross-examination then what more the pre-emptor could do to prove the knowledge within the meaning of sub­section (1) of section 96 of the Act. So, the appellate Court was absolutely in error when it observed that the pre-emptor could not prove that she did not know about the transfer in question before 20<sup>th</sup> of March, 1988. it further appears that the appellate court in a circuitus and negative way disbelieved the pre emptors case of knowledge about the transfer in question on 20<sup>th</sup> of march, 1988 and  the development made in the case land including erection of the shops therein after the said date by posing a question why she did not pray for any injunction   after   filing   of   the   pre-emption application  on  27.05.1998  if  the  pre-emptees undertook development work in the case land after 20<sup>th</sup> of March, 1998 in complete disregard to the factual position that the gap between 20<sup>th</sup> of March, 1998  upto  <em>27   </em>May,  1998  was  quite  enough to undertake the nature of the development works and erection of the structures on the case land as claimed by the pre-emptees. The appellate Court also failed to consider in its proper perspective that even  if  it  is  conceded  that  the  pre-emptees undertook development work after the filing of the pre-emption case and the pre-emptor failed to take any step by way of filing an application to injunct them from undertaking such development work that does not debar the pre-emptor to pray for pre-emption and for such failure no adverse presumpti can be drawn against her. In this regard, law is very much clear which is that the pre-emptees shall be entitled to get development cost till getting notice of the pre-emption application<br/> <br/><strong>60.</strong>   it is very much striking to state that the appellate Court itself disbelieved the pre-emptee’s case of spending TK. 5,00,000.00 for the development of the case land  including erection  of  the structures thereon on the ground that he failed to file any documentary evidence in that respect and found that the pre-emptee spent TK. 1,50,000.00 only. From  the  appellate  Court  judgment,  it  further appears that it proceeded with a prior view that since the pre-emption application was filed after 8 (eight)  years, the same was barred by limitation ignoring the positive evidence on record adduced by the pre-emptor that she had no knowledge about the transfer in question prior to 20<sup>th</sup> of March, 1998 and whatever development was done in the case land was done after the said date. The appellate Court also failed to consider the fact that the pre-emptee took specific plea in the written objection as well as in Court while he deposed as OPW-1 that notice under section 89 of the Act was served upon the pre-emptor but failed to prove the said fact which shows that the pre-emptee took false plea in his pleading to defeat the case of the pre-emptor and for this reason the appellate Court ought to have drawn an adverse presumption against him. It is true that the pre-emptee developed the case land and erected some shop rooms therein but the pre-emptor specifically  stated that those were done after the disclosure of the fact of transfer on 20<sup>tn</sup> of March, 1998.<br/> <br/><strong>61.</strong>   In  sifting the evidence of the PW’s in arriving at the finding of knowledge of the pre-emptor about the transfer in question, the appellate Court totally failed to consider the pertinent fact that the seller-opposite party No.4 is none else, but his full brother and the father of the pre-emptees Sultanuddin Bhuiyan used to cultivate the case land as bargadar during the life time of her father and then under them and the seller used to give her the share of the crops, so even if the pre-emptee was in possession of the case land till 20<sup>th</sup> of March, 1998 the pre-emptor had no scope to know about the transfer in question.<br/> <br/><strong>62.</strong>   In the face of positive evidence adduced by the pre-emptor as to knowledge about the transfer in question  as  discussed  above  the pre-emptee  was obliged to examine witnesses who as  per his own case participated  in  filling  up  the case  land  and erecting shop rooms therein after 1994 and before 20<sup>th</sup> March, 1998. But the pre-emptee failed to examine any such witness in the case. To specify, the pre-emptee did not examine the truck owner or the truck driver in support of his case that he filled, up the case land by bringing earth in truck from Gazipur and Monoharer chak. The pre-emptee examined one Tota Mia as OPW-5 to prove that earth was brought from Gazipur and Monoharer chak by truck at the cost of taka 3/4 lakh, but in cross-examination he stated that his house was two kilometers away from the case land and that he had no truck and did not submit any receipt of truck fare. The pre-emptee did not examine any one who erected the shop rooms in the case land. The pre-emptee examined Haridas as OPW-6 who is his alleged tenant in the case land since 1995. This OPW stated in his deposition that he had a furniture shop in the case land since 1995 but in support of his tenancy no agreement was produced. Although OPW-6 stated that he has been doing the business in the case land since 1995 by paying rent of TK.6,000.00 per year, no rent receipt was produced. All these categorically disproved the case of the contesting pre-emptee that he undertook development work in the case land in 1994/1995 rather supported the case of the pre-emptor that the development in the case land was done and shop rooms were erected after 20<sup>th</sup>  of March, 1998.<br/> <br/><strong>63.</strong>   I am of the view that by examining 4 (four) witnesses in support of the case of knowledge of the transfer in question on 20<sup>th</sup> of March, 1998 the pre-emptor discharged her onus and then the onus shifted upon the contesting pre-emptee that he developed the case land in 1994/1995 and then erected the shop rooms therein, but he failed to discharge the said onus. The appellate Court did not at all consider this legal aspect of the case.<br/> <br/><strong>64.</strong>   From the impugned judgment of the High Court Division, it appears that the High Court Division, in fact, did not discuss and consider the evidence on record on the question of limitation on the view that  the  question  of  limitation  "hinges  on  the credibility of the witnesses and the trial Court had the advantage to see the demeanor of the witnesses and as such, its decision in respect of such finding should prevail and accordingly, endorsed the finding of the trial Court on the question of limitation. In this  regard,  the  High  Court  Division  further observed that "The Court of appeal below, on the other hand, did not have the advantage to see the demeanor of the witnesses and as such the finding arrived at by the Court of appeal below as to limitation cannot get preference.<br/> <br/><strong>65.</strong>   In view of the discussions made hereinabove, I do not find anything wrong with the view taken by the High Court Division. Since the trial Court did not consider the question of improvement of the pre-emptees and the appellate Court found the same at TK.1,50,000.00, the High Court Division considering the admission of the pre-emptor that the pre-emptees made improvement in the case land at the cost of taka 40,000.00/50,000.00 fixed the development cost at  TK.75,000.00. I  find the  assessment  of  cost reasonable  and  based  on  evidence  on  record particularly in view of the admitted fact that no documentary evidence was produced in support of the development cost<br/> <br/><strong>66.</strong>   It is true that the judgment of High Court Division is not that happy as it should have been, but I do not find any error in the ultimate decision arrived at by the High Court Division in making the Rule absolute restoring those of the trial Court considering the judgments of the two Courts below.<br/> <br/><strong>67.</strong>   In  conclusion,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the appellate Court rejected the pre-emption application on  total  misreading,  non-consideration  of  the material evidence of the PW s and the OPW's, with reference to the pleading of the parties as well as the settled principle of law in sifting and weighing the evidence of a witness. I would dismiss the appeal without any order as to cost.<br/> <br/><strong><u>Nazmun Ara Sultana, J:</u></strong> I have gone through the separate judgments prepared by my learned brother, Surendra Kumar Sinha, J. and my learned brother Md.

Saudi-Bangladesh Services Company Limited (the respondent).<br/> <br/>In the arbitration proceeding before the Arbitral Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as the Tribunal), the respondent, as claimant, made a claim of Tk. 32,27,50,566.51, while the present petitioner, as respondent, not only denied the claim, but made a counter claim for Tk. 161,15,29,583.00 along with interest @ 16% per annum on the awarded sum.<br/> <br/>The three member Tribunal comprising of Mr. Justice M. H. Rahman, a former Head of the Caretaker Government and former Chief Justice of Bangladesh, Mr. M. Amirul Islam, Senior Advocate, Supreme Court of Bangladesh and Dr. M. Zahir, Senior Advocate, Supreme Court of Bangladesh, upon hearing the parties, by a majority decision, made an Award of Tk. 31,27,50,566 in favour of the claimant (the respondent herein) and dismissed the counter claim of the respondent (the petitioner herein).<br/> <br/>The dissenting opinion was given by Mr. M. Amirul Islam, who allowed the claim of the claimant for the amount of Tk. 4,88,72,217.43 and also allowed the counter-claim of respondent no.1 for Tk. 57,26,92,897.67.<br/> <br/>Since the instant application was filed challenging the legality and propriety of the Award on the ground of non-compliance as well as violation of the provisions of the Arbitration Act, 2001 by the Tribunal, and that too, at the stage of making and signing the Award, this Court is not inclined to enter into a discourse regarding the claims and counter claims of the parties or, for that matter, the merit of the case.<br/> <br/>Mr. Ajmalul Hossain, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner submits at the outset that he will not press ground numbers I, II, III, IV and V which relate to jurisdiction of the Tribunal, but would rely on the other grounds, particularly ground numbers VI, VII and XI stated in his application.<br/> <br/>Giving a factual background of the entire arbitration proceeding, Mr. Hossain submits that in the instant case, the majority decision of the Trubunal is not legal and binding upon the parties in view of the fact that one of the Arbitrators, namely, Mr. M. Amirul Islam (hereinafter referred to as the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator) was completely left out of the process of consultation before finalizing and making the Award. Mr. Hossain submits that the spirit and intent of the Arbitration Act, 2001 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) is to ensure that the arbitration proceeding including the making and signing of the Award is conducted by effective participation of all the members of the Tribunal, but in the instant case, there was a clear deviation therefrom. Mr. Hossain accepts the position that there are may be an Award by the majority, but contends that such an Award has to be made after taking due consideration of the views and opinion of the dissenting Arbitrator.<br/> <br/>Referring to Annexures I and II, annexed with the dissenting opinion marked as Annexure F, Mr. Hossian submits that upon conclusion of the hearing on 05.04.2006, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator had written to both the Chairman and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Arbitrator (Dr. M. Zahir) on the following day expressing his view that the Tribunal should meet and deliberate on the issues before making the Award.<br/> <br/>Referring to the respective endorsements made by the Chairman and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Arbitrator on the letter sent by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator, Mr. Hossain submits that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator was led to believe that the members of the Tribunal would meet at BILIA (the venue of the Arbitration proceeding) for holding deliberation before making the Award. However, when the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator went to BILIA at the appointed date and time, ie., on 08.04.2006 at 10:00 a.m., he was given a one hundred page typed Award, which had already been signed by both the Chairman and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Arbitrator. Upon receiving the same, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator put the following endorsement on the Award :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“I just now saw the opinion this morning at 10.20 a.m. Since I differ with the opinion given herein I will submit my separate opinion.”</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;">Sd/-(M. Amir-Ul-Islam)<br/>Barrister-at-Law, Senior Advocate</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Mr. Hossain contends that without paying any heed to the aforesaid request and without even affording an opportunity to the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator to participate in the deliberation and express his views before the Award was made, the Chairman and the other member of the Tribunal finalized and signed the Award. Therefore, on this ground, the Award is liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/>Substantiating his argument, Mr. Hossain has referred to the opening paragraph of the dissenting opinion given by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator, as evidenced by Annexure-F, which reads as under :  </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“At the outset I express my discomfort with the statement in paragraph 45 of the award opinion of my fellow con-arbitrators, Mr. Justice M.H. Rahman, Chairman and Dr. M. Zahir that “Mr. M. Amir-Ul Islam, Barrister-at-Law, Senior Advocate, co-arbitrator, has been consulted ...”. On the contrary, I wrote letters to both of my co-arbitrators on April 06, 2006 stating that our very brief discussion on the date of the close of the hearing was not enough and we should discuss at length with regard to each of the issues before we make up our mind. In response to my letters both the learned co-arbitrators were pleased to fix a meeting on April 08, 2006 in the morning. But with utter surprise both my co-arbitrators without allowing time for the proposed discussion signed the award at 10.20 on the same date before I could even have a look at the award which was produced in a finished and conclusive form typed on a stamped paper, already signed by my two co-arbitrators.”  </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Mr. Hossain submits that it is evident from the aforesaid statement made by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator that he was neither consulted nor was he given any opportunity, as was requested by him on the previous day, to discuss the issues before the Award was made.<br/> <br/> Referring to section 43(v) of the Act, Mr. Hossain contends that although the law requires the arbitration proceeding to be conducted in accordance with the agreement of the parties, there was a clear deviation from the agreement in as much as, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator was totally excluded from the deliberation process before making and signing the Award. In doing so, according to Mr. Hossain, the Tribunal had not only acted in utter disregard to the requirement of section 23 of the Act, but had also acted contrary to the provisions of section 25 of the Act. Consequently, Mr. Hossain submits, the Award is liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/>Mr. A. J. Mohammad Ali, Senior Advocate appearing with Ms. Verbeena Huda, Advocate for the respondent (Saudi Arabia Airlines Corporation) submits that the Award under challenge was passed by the Tribunal upon holding a lengthy hearing in presence of both the parties, who were duly represented by their learned lawyers. Mr. Ali further submits that the arbitration proceeding lasted for about three years and, therefore, it cannot be said that the parities did not have adequate opportunity to place their respective case before the Tribunal. Mr. Ali further submits that the agreement between the parties provides for an Award by the majority and in the instant case, the Award having been so made, it does not call for any interference by this Court.<br/> <br/>Mr. Ali submits categorically that the entire proceedings took place before the Tribunal comprising of the Chairman and the two Arbitrators who had ample opportunity to discuss the issues amongst themselves when the hearing took place and, therefore, the allegation of excluding the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator from the deliberation process before making the Award is not tenable. Mr. Ali further submits that if any member of a Tribunal decides to give a dissenting opinion, he can very well do so. Mr. Ali lastly submits that if the instant application is allowed, it will open a floodgate and frustrate the purpose and spirit of the Act, which is primarily intended to settle disputes between the parties outside the Court.<br/> <br/>Undoubtedly, there is a great deal of force in the contention of Mr. Ali that the purpose of the Arbitration Act, 2001 is to minimize the duration of litigation between the parties by affording a forum for settling their dispute outside the Court.<br/> <br/>When an arbitration proceeding is conducted before an Arbitral Tribunal, there may very well be an Award by the majority. This is an undisputed position. At the same time, the arbitration proceeding must also conform to certain well established principles and norms of legal rules and conduct. Upon conclusion of hearing, the members of the Tribunal must hold proper deliberations amongst themselves covering all the issues of the proceeding before making and signing the Award. This is not an idle formality, but a judicial requirement designed to ensure that the matter is heard and deliberated by each and every member of the Tribunal before making and signing the Award.<br/> <br/>Although a good number of cases have been cited by Mr. Hossain, I shall only refer to those which are relevant for the purpose of disposal of the instant case. On the other hand, Mr. Mohammad Ali has lightened the burden of the Court by not referring to any decision.<br/> <br/>In Sheik Abdulla v. M.V.R.S. Firm and Sons and another, reported in 1924 Rangoon 153, both the parties nominated five Arbitrators and agreed that the Award of the majority of the Arbitrators would prevail. Nevertheless, the Court held :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“In this view of the reference each party was entitled to have the benefit of the opinion and decision of all the five arbitrators and not only some of them. From the fact that the three arbitrators who actually made the award happened to hold the same opinion it cannot be assumed that even if the other two had acted, the opinion of the former three would not have been affected. It is not impossible that a discussion among all the five might have produced a different award.”             </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In another case, reported in XXII CWN (1917-18), 301 (Abu Hamid Zahira Ala v. Golam Sarwar),  the Court held :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“……. It is essential that there should be a unanimous participation by the arbitrators in consulting and deliberating upon the award to be made ; the operation of this rule is in no way affected by the fact that authority is conferred upon the arbitrators to make a majority award ; even where less than the whole number of arbitrators may make a valid award, they cannot do so without consulting the other arbitrators.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Mr. Hossain refers to the widely followed work of “Rusesell on Arbitration”, 28<sup>th </sup> Edition, where it has been stated :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“All the arbitrators must act together. As they must all act, so they must all act together. They must each be present at every meeting ; and the witnesses and the parties must be examined in the presence of them all.</em><br/><em>All must make award together. Where there are two or more arbitrators, all should execute the award at the same time and place. If they do not, the award may be invalidated, but as the objection is one of a formal character, if no other objection is shown, the court may remit the award to the arbitrators for correction.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The aforesaid statement was cited with approval in the case of European Grain v. Johnston, reported in Lloyd’s Law Reports (1982) Vol. 2, 551, where the Court held :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“What I think the authorities show, as must be right, is that an arbitration conducted by a tribunal of several arbitrators necessarily requires a joint process of full and complete adjudication by all of them, so that the ultimate award represents the state of mind of all of them at the time when they sign it”.</em>(Per Lord Justice Kerr).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It appears from Annexure I and Annexure II of Annexure F, that upon conclusion of the hearing on 05.04.2006, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator sent a letter on the following day to the Chairman and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Arbitrator of the Tribunal requesting for a meeting to discuss and deliberate on the issues before making the Award. It is perhaps pertinent to quote the said letter in full, which reads as under :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“April 6, 2006<br/>Dear Hon’ble Chairman<br/>Mr. Justice Habibur Rahman and<br/>Co Arbitrator Dr. M. Zahir<br/><br/><strong>Ref:</strong> Saudia Arabian Airlines Corporation<br/>            -Versus-<br/>Saudia Bangladesh Services Company Ltd.<br/><br/>I refer to our discussions yesterday after the close of the hearing. I thought this was not adequate to discuss the proposed award, not allowing any opportunity to discuss the issues and the underlying legal principles involved both on question of fact and law. While we accepted the obligation to hear and determine the dispute between the parties it will not be proper to rush for an award without discussing each of the issues. You proposed Saturday, 08.04.2006 I hope you will not close your mind and take a view before we have had opportunity to share our thoughts and reasoning. I invite you to arrange a mutually convenient time when we can discuss the issues between the parties and deliberate our reasoning for resolution of those issues. You suggested Saturday but before signing the award there has to be enough time, opportunity and willingness to share the reasoning before taking a view and finalizing the Award.<br/><br/>Since this matter is of the greatest importance to the parties, I feel that it is incumbent upon us to properly and judicially approach the issues with a view to resolving them and the material and legal principles have to be considered before the Award is finalized.<br/><br/>Kindly inform me of a convenient date and time for proper deliberations with adequate opportunity to deal with each of the issues before the award is made. If there is such an opportunity prior to finalizing the Award, then, I shall certainly make myself available to deliberate upon these issues and consider the proper Award to be made in this case.<br/><br/>Yours sincerely,<br/>M. Amir-Ul Islam<br/>Co Arbitrator”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Upon receiving the aforesaid letter, the Chairman of the Tribunal made the following endorsement :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The matter was heard for days. The parties have given their written submission extensively. I shall be at the Bilia at 10-10 AM on next Saturday.”</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;">Signed (eligible)<br/>6.30 p.m. 06.04.06</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The 2<sup>nd</sup> Arbitrator made the following endorsement :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“We have already exchanged opinion, pl. contact Chairman. Friday 7<sup>th</sup> April, 06 we can meet. Alternatively you can give your opinion later. But whatever the Chairman says is OK with me.”</em></div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;">Signed (M. Zahir)<br/>6 April 2006</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The following day, i.e., 7<sup>th</sup> April was a holiday, being Friday. On 08.06.2006 (Saturday), when the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator went to BILIA at 10:00 a.m., he was given the 100 page typed Award, which had already been signed by the Chairman and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Arbitrator.<br/> <br/>Immediately thereupon, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator made the following observation, which appears at page 100 of the Award :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“I just now saw the opinion this morning at 10.20 a.m. Since I differ with the opinion given herein I will submit my separate opinion.”</em></div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;">Sd/-(M. Amir-Ul-Islam)<br/>Barrister-at-Law, Senior Advocate.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Furthermore, at page 53 of the dissenting opinion, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator made the following observation :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Though it is a dissenting award, I wish, I could share my views as expressed in this opinion with my co-arbitrators before they signed their award which I did not have the opportunity to see before they were signed by them.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From the sequence of events noted above, it is apparent that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator was not provided with any scope or opportunity to deliberate on the issues with the other members of the Tribunal and express his views before the Award was made. Moreover, there is no indication in the endorsement made by the Chairman that he had already discussed the matter with the 2<sup>nd</sup> Arbitrator. Rather, from his endorsement, it appears that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator was asked to be present at BILIA on Saturday at 10:00 in the morning, thereby giving him an impression that there would be a deliberation before making the Award, as was requested for by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator in his letter dated 06.04.2006.<br/> <br/>At the penultimate page of Award made by the two Arbitrators, there is a statement to the effect that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator had been consulted. Paragraph 45 at page 99 of the Award reads as under :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Mr. M. Amir-Ul-Islam (sic), Barrister-at-Law, Senior Advocate, co-arbitrator, has been consulted. He differs from the above finding and has stated that he will give his opinion later on. This award is given on the basis of agreement between the Chairman and another arbitrator, that is, a majority of two in a panel of three arbitrators.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>However, the endorsement made by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator at page 100 of the Award as well as the opening and concluding remarks made by him in his dissenting opinion, quoted above, clearly demonstrate that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator was neither consulted nor given any opportunity to deliberate on the issues with the other two Arbitrators before the Award was finalized and signed. In other words, the Award was made and signed by the Chairman and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Arbitrator without even the participation, let alone any input, of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator. Evidently, there was an omission or failure on the part of the Chairman of the Tribunal to deliberate on the issues with the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator or, at least, provide an opportunity to him to express his views on the issues before making the Award, moreso, when he had expressed such intention immediately after conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, as is evident from the letter dated 06.04.2006, referred to above.<br/> <br/>Having discussed the factual aspect and back-ground of the matter, I now intend to deal with the legal aspect of the case.<br/> <br/>Section 23 of the Act, which deals with the general responsibilities of the Tribunal, stipulates that the Tribunal shall deal with the dispute submitted to it “fairly” and “impartially”.<br/> <br/>Section 25 of the Act provides that subject to the Act, the Tribunal shall follow the procedure “to be agreed on” by the parties in “conducting its proceedings”. A similar provision appears in the ‘United Nations Commission on International Trade Law’ (briefly UNCITRAL), Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Model Law’). Article 28(4) of the Model Law stipulates that in all cases, the arbitral tribunal shall decide in accordance with the terms of the contract.<br/> <br/>Section 36(3) of the Act mandates that the Tribunal shall decide in accordance with the terms of the contract.<br/> <br/>Upon a combined reading of the sections and articles referred to above, the conclusion that flows therefrom is that the Tribunal, meaning all the members and not just the majority, are not only required to act fairly, but are also required to follow the procedure that has been agreed by and between the parties “in conducting the proceedings”.<br/> <br/>The term “proceeding” has not been defined in the Act. However, Article 32(1) of the Model Law provides that the arbitral proceedings are terminated by the final award. In my view, the term ‘proceeding’ includes the final deliberations/discussions that takes place between the members of the Tribunal before an Award is made and signed. Therefore, the duty to act fairly, as envisaged by section 23 of the Act, is not merely confined to the arbitration proceeding itself, but extends to the deliberations that is required to take place between the members of the Tribunal before an Award is made.<br/> <br/>Section 37 of the Act provides that the decision of the Tribunal shall be by a majority of its members. Article 29 of the Model Law contains a similar provision.<br/> <br/>An Award by the majority connotes an Award where each and every member of the Tribunal actively participates not only in the arbitration proceeding, but also in the deliberation that takes place between the members of the Tribunal before the Award is made and signed. There may very well be an Award by the majority, but that should only be made after there has been a proper and complete deliberation between the members of the Tribunal covering all the issues in dispute between the parties. However, if an Award is made in violation of the aforesaid procedure, it would tantamount to a procedural impropriety and therefore, the resultant Award cannot be termed as an Award by the majority. In my view, this is certainly not the intendment of the parties.<br/> <br/>In any event, whether the Award of the Tribunal is ‘unanimous’ or ‘by a majority’, it is imperative that there must be deliberation /discussion between the members of the Tribunal prior to making and signing the Award. This is not an idle formality, but a legal requirement, as reflected in section 23 of the Act, which enjoins a positive duty upon the Tribunal to act ‘fairly’.<br/> <br/>Furthermore, the Tribunal is not only expected to act fairly, but it must also act judicially in the discharge of its duty. If it does otherwise, that would be contrary to and violative of the principles of natural justice since judicial acts, by their very nature, are deemed to be amenable to the rules of natural justice.<br/> <br/>In Dewan Singh v. Champat Singh, reported in AIR 1970 SC 967, the Supreme Court of India observed :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The proceedings before the arbitra-tors are quasi-judicial proceedings. They must be conducted in accordance with the principles of natural justice.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of S.L. Kapoor v. Jagmohan, reported in AIR 1981 SC 136, it was held :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Non-observance of natural justice by itself causes prejudice to a party and proof of prejudice to a party and proof of prejudice independent thereof is unnecessary.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In ‘Law and Practice of International Commercial Arbitration’ (Alan Redfern and Martin Hunter, 3<sup>rd</sup> Ed., pg. 257), it has been observed :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“A tribunal should act judicially. The duty to act judicially is a duty which extends to all aspect of the proceedings.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It has further been observed (at page 377) :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Where an arbitral tribunal is composed of more than  one  arbitrator,  it  is  self-evident  that  there  should  be discussion between the arbitrators before the award is drawn up. Some system of law contain mandatory provisions to this effect but, whether this is so or not, the principle that arbitrators must consult before issuing their award is well-recognised.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The aforesaid principle was endorsed by the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) in the matter of Klockner Industries and Others v. United Republic of Cameroon, reported in (1986) XI Yearbook of Commercial Arbitration, 161.<br/> <br/>As has been stated so aptly by Mahmood, J more than a century ago in the case of Nand Ram v. Fakir Chand, reported in ILR 7 (1885) All 523 :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“What the parties to a reference to arbitration intended is that the persons to whom the reference is made should meet and discuss together all the matters referred, and that the award should be the result of their united deliberations. This conference and deliberation in the presence of all the arbitrators is the very essence of the arbitration, and the sole reason why the award is made binding.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the instant case, the parties had agreed to have their dispute settled by a Tribunal comprising of three members. Both the parties also agreed that the Award of the Tribunal shall be by a majority. It was therefore implied that the Award should be the outcome of the deliberation between each and every member of the Tribunal, even though at the end, the Award may either be unanimous or by a majority. However, in no circumstances can it be inferred that by agreeing to an Award by the majority, the parties had empowered the Chairman to deliberate on the issues with only one member of the Tribunal to the exclusion of the other member before making and signing the Award.<br/> <br/>Although section 37(2) of the Act authorizes the Chairman to decided “questions of procedure”, if authorized by the parties or all the members of the Tribunal, it does not confer any authority on the Chairman to make the Award without undertaking a proper and detailed deliberation with the other members of the Tribunal. However, in the instant case the Tribunal or, in any event, the Chairman had acted in contravention of the terms of the agreement between the parties.<br/> <br/>Despite having made a request in writing, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator was not given any scope or opportunity to deliberate on the issues with Chairman and the other member of the Tribunal before the Award was finalized and signed. On the contrary, he was merely required to append his signature on a one hundred page typed Award which had already been signed by the Chairman and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Arbitrator. Even if there was any deliberation before the Award was made and signed, it took place between the Chairman and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Arbitrator, evidently, without the participation and input of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator. In such premises, the Award in question cannot be termed as an Award by the majority. Consequently, it cannot be said that the Tribunal had either acted fairly or in accordance with the terms of the agreement between the parties, as it was required to do under the Act.<br/> <br/>From a careful reading of the provisions laid down in the Act as well as the Model Law, it appears that neither the Act nor the Model Law have considered the scenario where one of the Arbitrator is, in fact, excluded totally from the process of deliberation that is required to take place between the members of a Tribunal before an Award is made. Neither the Act or the Model Law contains any provision to that effect.<br/> <br/>In my view, the provisions of section 43(1)(a)(v) of the Act as well as Articles 34(2)(a)(iv) and 36(1)(a)(iv) of the UNCITRAL Model Law are attracted in the instant case, both of which provides for setting aside an Award on the ground that “the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties”.<br/> <br/>It has also been argued by Mr. Hossain that the Award is liable to be set aside on the ground of being opposed to public policy.<br/> <br/>In the case of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited v. Environmental Engineers Ltd. and another, reported in (2001) 2 Comp 79 (Bom), it was held :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“As the expression is incapable of precise definition, those challenges would be available, if the court finds the award abnoxious to its sense of justice, based on settled principles of law, whether as to the conduct of the arbitrator or arbitral proceedings or the award itself. Justice is the beginning and the end. Law must ultimately reach out to justice. Public policy contemplates that, courts must reflect it.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In Murlidhar Agarwal and another v State of Uttar Pradesh and others, reported in AIR 1974 SC 1924, the Supreme Court of India observed :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Public policy’, has been defined by Winfield as a principle of judicial legislation or interpretation founded on the current needs of the community.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd v. SAW Pipes Ltd, reported in AIR 2003 SC 2629, the Supreme Court of India held :          </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“In exercising jurisdiction, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot act in breach of some provision of substantive  law or the provisions of the Act.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case referred to above, the Court further held :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“It can be stated that the concept of public policy connotes some matter which concerns public good and the public interest. What is for public good or in public interest or what would be injurious or harmful to the public good or public interest has varied from time to   time. However, the award which is, on the face of it, patently in violation of statutory provisions cannot be said to be in public interest.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Evidently, the final deliberation that took place leading to the making and signing of the Award was only between the Chairman and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Arbitrator to the total exclusion of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator, although the parties had referred the matter to a Tribunal comprising of three members. In my view, this is not what the Act or the Model Law contemplates and this is certainly not what the parties intended. Consequently, upholding the Award would be against the spirit and intendment of the Act and that, no doubt, would be contrary to public policy.<br/> <br/>Having considered the submissions advanced by the learned Advocates of the contending sides and in due deference to the decisions cited above, this Court is inclined to hold that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Arbitrator was neither consulted nor given any opportunity by the Chairman of the Tribunal to deliberate and express his views on the issues before making and signing the Award under challenge.<br/> <br/>In the premises noted above, I am of the view that there was non-compliance with the provisions of the Arbitration Act, 2001. Consequently, the Award dated 08.06.2006 made by the majority members of the Arbitral Tribunal is liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the Award dated 08.06.2006 is hereby set aside.<br/> <br/>There will be no order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Nazrul Islam Talukder, J:</u></strong><br/><br/>This Rule, at the instance of the convict-petitioner, was issued calling upon the opposite-party to show cause as to why the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 19.7.2006 passed by the learned Judge of the Special Tribunal No. 4, Dhaka in Special Tribunal Case No. 144 of 1999 arising out of Keranigonj Police Station Case No. 11 dated 4.12.1998 corresponding to G.R. No. 412 of  1998 convicting the convict-petitioner under section 4 of the Explosive Substance Act, 1908 and sentencing him thereunder to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 7 (seven) years and to pay a fine of Tk. 5,000/= in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 6 (six) months more should not be quashed and/or pass such other or further order or orders as to this Court may seem fit and proper.<br/><br/>Facts relevant for disposal of this Rule may be, briefly, stated as follows: Acting on a tip-off, in the morning of 4.02.1998, the informant came to know that a gang of dacoits would go at Rajarhat on Dhaka Mawa road for committing dacoity. The informant along with some Constables, on the basis of aforesaid information, went to the place of occurrence. After reaching the place of occurrence, the informant and others started searching out the different vehicles which were plying on the way. On the date of occurrence at around 7:15 a.m, a baby taxi being No. Dhaka Metro. 031289 was heading towards the place of occurrence from Dhaka. At the time of searching the baby taxi, 5 suspected persons tried to flee away from the baby taxi. However, the informant and others caught them red-handed and carried out a search and recovered a pipe gun loaded with one round bullet from the waist of the convict, namely, Akram, 9 Cocktails from the waist of present convict-petitioner, a Chapati of 15 inches long with a wooden bat from the waist of another convict, namely, Alamgir, 8 Cocktails from the waist of convict, namely, Babul and 5 Cocktails from waist of convict, namely, Safar Ali. The informant and others prepared a seizure list in presence of the local witnesses and took their signature on it. The convict-petitioner and other convicts could not offer any satisfactory account for keeping the alleged arms and explosive substance in their possession. Hence, the F.I.R was lodged against the convict-petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the petitioner) and others under section 4 of the Explosive Substances Act on 4.12.1998.<br/><br/>During investigation, the police recorded the statements of the witnesses under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Having found <em>prima-facie</em> case, the police submitted charge sheet No. 2090 dated 7.6.1999 against the petitioner and others under section 4 of the Explosive Substance Act, 1908. After submission of the charge sheet, the case record was sent to the Special Tribunal for trial.<br/><br/>At the time of commencement of trial, the learned Judge of the Tribunal framed charge against the petitioner and others under section 4 of the Explosive Substance Act and the same was read over and explained to them who pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried in accordance with law.<br/><br/>At the trial of the case, the prosecution examined as many as 11 witnesses to prove the case. The learned Judge of the Tribunal after recording the evidence from the witnesses and on perusal of the same found the petitioner and others guilty under section 4 of the Explosive Substance Act and sentenced them thereunder by the impugned judgment and order as aforesaid.<br/><br/>It is to be noted that the petitioner was arrested by the police on 5.12.1998 and he was enlarged on bail by the learned Judge of the Tribunal on 29.02.2000, but after enlarging on bail he was found absent from the proceeding and accordingly, the order of bail was cancelled by the learned Judge of the Tribunal on 23.10.2000. However, the petitioner remained absconding till delivery of judgment.<br/><br/>After delivery of judgment, the petitioner was arrested by the police in connection with another case and he was shown arrested in the present case on 11.02.2009 and produced before the learned Judge of the Tribunal, who sent him to jail to undergo the sentence. The petitioner thereafter submitted an application for certified copy of the impugned judgment and order and other relevant papers for preferring a miscellaneous case under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. After procuring the certified copy of the judgment and order, the petitioner approached this court with an application under section 561A or the Code of Criminal Procedure and obtained the present Rule.<br/><br/>At the very outset, Mr. Shah Alam Dewan, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner, submits that there is no sufficient legal evidence on record to connect the petitioner with the alleged offence under section 4 of the Explosive Substances Act and that the evidence adduced by the police personnel was not supported by the public witnesses. He next submits that P.W.4, a seizure list witness, has not supported and corroborated the prosecution story and the recovery of the Cocktails from the possession of the petitioner. He then submits that since the informant and Investigating Officer are same person, the evidence adduced by him appears to be doubtful and the impugned judgment and order, on the basis of doubtful evidence, is liable to be quashed. He empathically submits that though Cocktails allegedly recovered from the possession of the petitioner were not examined by any explosive expert to come to a decision as to whether the alleged Cocktails were really Cocktails or not and as such the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence is not based on satisfactory and reliable evidence and as such the same is liable to be quashed. The learned Advocate for the petitioner, in support of his submissions,  relied upon the cases of Masud and others Vs. State, 3 BLC 107, State Vs. Sarowar Uddin, 5BLC 451, Delwar Hossain Vs. State, 16 BLC(2011) 32 and Md. Harun Bepari Vs. State, 5 MLR (2000) 395, Md. Sayem Islam Vs. State, 13 MLR 155, Aslam Jahangir Vs. State, 20 BLD 426, Pear Ali Vs. State, 7 BLT (HCD) 59 and Ashok Kumar Saha Vs. State, 2 BLT (HCD) 79. <br/><br/>On the other hand, Mr. Md. Shohrowardi, learned Deputy Attorney-General along with Mr. Md. Nazibur Rahman, learned Assistant Attorney-General and Mr. Md. Monjur Kader, learned Assistant Attorney-General appearing on behalf of the State, submits that there is sufficient legal evidence on the record of the case to connect the petitioner with the alleged offence under section 4 of the Explosive Substances Act. He next submits that the prosecution examined as many as 11 witnesses to prove the prosecution case and that there is sufficient legal evidence on record to connect the petitioner with the offence under section 4 of the Explosive Substances Act. He then submits that this Court not being the Court of appeal has hardly any scope to sift and assess the evidence like a Court of appeal in its extra-ordinary jurisdiction under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He emphatically submits that the convict-petitioner being enlarged on bail deliberately remained absconding at the time of cross-examining the prosecution witnesses and that he also remained absconding at the time of delivery of judgment. He lastly submits that since the petitioner has not come before this Court with clean hands, he is not entitled to get relief under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure and as such the Rule should be discharged.<br/><br/>We have gone through the application under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the materials annexed thereto.<br/><br/>Before we take up the question for consideration as to whether the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence should be quashed or not, it will be necessary to see the extent of power, scope, principles and categories of cases in which High Court Division may invoke its power and authority under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/><br/>In the case of <strong>Abdul Quader Chowdhury Vs. The State, 28 DLR (AD) (1976) 38</strong>, it has been held that the High Court Division may quash a criminal proceeding invoking its jurisdiction  under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the following circumstances:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>      (1) Interference even at an initial stage may be justified where the facts are so preposterous that even on admitted facts no case stands against the accused.<br/>      (2) Where the institution and continuation of the proceeding amounts to an abuse of the process of the court.<br/>      (3) Where there is a legal bar against the initiation or continuation of the proceeding.<br/>      (4) In a case where the allegations in the F.I.R or the petition of complaint, even if taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety, do not constitute the offence as alleged.<br/>      (5) The allegations against the accused although constitute an offence alleged but there is either no legal evidence adduced in support of the case or the evidence adduced clearly or manifestly fails to prove the charge.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Similar view on the principles and categories of cases for quashing the proceeding was, subsequently, followed in many cases including the cases of Ali Akkas Vs. Enayet Hossain and others, 17 BLD (AD) (1997) 44,and Bangladesh Vs. Tan Khen Hock, 31 DLR (AD) (1979) 69.<br/><br/>It is pertinent to note that the inherent power under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure can be invoked at any stage of the proceeding even after conclusion of the trial, if it is necessary to prevent the abuse of the process of the court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. In the case of Sher Ali (Md) and others Vs. The State, 46 DLR (AD) (1994) 67 it has been decided that the inherent power under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure can be exercised to quash a proceeding or even a conviction on conclusion of a trial if the court concerned got no jurisdiction to hold the said trial or the facts alleged against the accused do not constitute any Criminal offence, or the conviction has been based on ‘no evidence’ or otherwise to secure ends of justice.<br/><br/>Coming back to the present case, we want to address the submissions of the learned Advocates for the petitioner seriatim.<br/><br/>It is on record that in order to prove the prosecution case, the prosecution examined as many as 11 witnesses to prove the prosecution case. P.W.1 Rabindra Narayan Saha supported and corroborated the prosecution case in his deposition and cross-examination and claimed that 9 Cocktails were recovered from the possession of the petitioner. The aforesaid evidence given by the P.W.1 was also supported and corroborated by P.W.2, P.W.5,6 and 7. A reference to the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses clearly and manifestly shows that 9 Cocktails were recovered from the exclusive control and possession of the convict-petitioner. It should be borne in mind that the jurisdiction under section 561A can not be invoked for the purpose of examining the correctness, legality and propriety of any finding, sentence and order passed by the criminal Courts inferior to this Court. Section 561A may be invoked only for the specific purpose set out in this section and this Court may, in appropriate cases, exercise its extra-ordinary power under this section to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. Admittedly, the power of this Court under section 561A is very limited. This court not being the court of appeal is not in a position to re-assess and sift the evidence on record like the court of appeal in its extra-ordinary jurisdiction under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/><br/>In order to address the submission of learned Advocate for the petitioner that since the informant and investigating officer is the same person, the informant is an interested witness and the impugned judgment and order based on the evidence of interested witness is not sustainable in the eye of law.<br/><br/>It is true that generally, an informant who is a police officer should not be an investigation officer in order to maintain the neutrality and acceptability of the trial of the case in the estimation of litigant public and the posture to appoint the informant as an investigating officer is normally deprecated and discarded. Practically, there is no bar on the part of the informant to act as an Investigating Officer in the eye of law. It is a well settled principle of law that the evidence of police personnel should not be discarded simply because they belong to police force as their evidence is also legal evidence within the meaning of section 3 of the Evidence Act. Section 134 of the Evidence Act contemplates that no particular number of witnesses shall, in any case, be required for the proof of any fact and as such conviction can be based on the evidence of a solitary witness if his evidence is full, complete and self-contained having no blemish and taint thereto. There is nothing on record to show that there was any enmity between the petitioner and the informant nor any suggestion was given to that effect. Under the circumstances, we do not find any material and circumstances which may lead us to hold that the evidence of informant and investigating officer is blemished and tainted one that may persuade us to keep the same out of consideration. Furthermore, this Court not being the Court of appeal has hardly any scope to sift and assess the evidence like the Court of appeal in its extra ordinary jurisdiction and the aforesaid view has been reflected in the case of Ayub Ali (Md) Vs. Abdul Khaleque, 56 DLR(HC)(2004) 489. Against this backdrop of the case, the submission made by the learned Advocate does not hold good and the same falls through.<br/><br/>Considering the above facts and circumstances of the case and the evidence of record, it can not be said that there is no legal evidence against the petitioner to connect him with the offence levelled against him and for insufficiency of the evidence if any, it can not be said that the petitioner may escape from the conviction and sentence on the ground of insufficiency of evidence of the case under the Jurisdiction of section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/><br/>Precisely speaking, it is not the case of the petitioner that the trial of the case was a coram non-judice. So, we would not like to embark upon that aspect of the case for our consideration and decision.<br/><br/>Now, we want to consider as to whether the petitioner has come before this Court with clean hands or not. It appears from the record of the case that the petitioner was enlarged on bail by the learned Judge of the Tribunal on 29.2.2000 which is very much evident from the annexure-E to the application. However, the petitioner being admitted to on bail remained absconding during cross examination of the prosecution witnesses. Accordingly, during trial, the learned Judge of the Tribunal cancelled the order of bail of the petitioner on 23.10.2000. Admittedly, the petitioner remained absconding during trial of the case and as such he could not cross examine the prosecution witnesses. Any way, the trial was held in absence of the petitioner. The learned Judge of the Tribunal, after taking evidence and on perusal of the evidence and other materials on record, found the petitioner guilty under section 4 of the Explosive Substances Act and sentenced him thereunder to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 7 (seven) years and to pay a fine of Tk. 5,000/-, in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 6 (six) months more. Admittedly, the petitioner was found absent at the time of delivery of judgment. However, after delivery of judgment the petitioner was arrested in connection with another case and sent to jail to suffer the sentence. Subsequently, the petitioner filed this application under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure before this Court and obtained this Rule.<br/><br/>In this connection, it may be mentioned that this Court has always disfavored to grant relief in its extraordinary jurisdiction under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure to an absconder who does not approach the Court with clean hands. In the case of Alamgir Hossain Vs. State reported in 49 DLR (HCD) (1997) 630<strong><em>,</em></strong> it has been decided that:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“A convict may invoke the jurisdiction of this Division under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure if he can make a case of Coram non judice of the trial Court or that the facts alleged do not constitute any criminal offence or the conviction has been passed on no evidence or other wise to secure the ends of justice and with that we add that he should approach the Court with clean hands.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The aforesaid view has been reflected and endorsed by the Appellate Division in the cases of Sher Ali(Md) and others Vs. State, 46 DLR (AD) (1994) 67 and Md. Khoka Mollah Vs. The State, 22 BLD (AD) (2002) 229.<br/><br/>It is an indisputable fact that after being admitted to bail on 29.2.2000, the petitioner remained absconding till delivery of judgment on 19.7.2006 and he was also on the run for a long time till he was shown arrested in the present case on 11.2.2009. Section 27(6A) of the Special Powers Act, 1974 provides that if the accused being enlarged on bail remains absconding , there is no necessity for issuing a further direction directing the accused to appear in the proceeding. The aforesaid view finds support in the case of Abu Taleb Vs. The State, 59 DLR (AD) (2007) 93. Since the petitioner was enlarged on bail and he, deliberately, avoided the proceeding keeping himself in abscondence which disentitles him to get relief under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In view of section 8 of the Evidence Act, abscondence of an accused lends support to the direct evidence of eye witnesses connecting the accused with the crime. The aforesaid view has been reflected in the case of Amir Hossain Hawlader Vs The State, 4 BLD (AD) (1984) 193<strong><em>.</em></strong><br/><br/>However, the petitioner could not offer any plausible explanation as to his abscondence from proceeding jumping bail. Taking this aspect of the matter in view, we feel constrained to hold that the convict-petitioner has not approached this court with clean hands.<br/><br/>Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the settled proposition of law as discussed above, the decisions cited by the learned Advocate for the petitioner do not fit in the facts and circumstances of the present case as the facts, purpose and scope of those decisions are quite different and distinguishable from the present case and as such those decisions have no manner of application in the instant case.<br/><br/>Considering the above facts and circumstances of the case and the evidence on record, it cannot be said that there is no legal evidence on the record of the case to connect the convict-petitioner with the offence levelled against him under section 4 of the Explosive Substances Act.<br/><br/>On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and the stated decisions discussed above, we are of the view that the present case is not a case of ‘no evidence’; rather it is a case of ‘evidence’, however insufficient it may be.<br/><br/>Having considered all aspects of the case, we do not find any merit in this Rule.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the Rule is discharged.<br/><br/>      Communicate this judgment to the concerned Tribunal immediately.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

There is no gainsaying the fact that this Grameen Bank could not have been established unless professor Muhammad Yunus came forward with the ideas which he dreamt of providing 'micro credit' facilities to the rural poor while he was a professor of the Chittagong University. He is the precursor for the establishment of the Bank and its founder Managing Director. Professor Muhammad Yunus was appointed as Managing Director initially as per terms and conditions of </strong><strong>the Implementation Division's</strong><strong> memo dated 11.09.1980 of the Ministry of Finance and Planning Division, Government of Bangladesh. He was reappointed on 25.08.1990, in the said post by the Board of Grameen Bank. The Managing Director will not be elected but be appointed by the Board with prior approval of the Government under section 14(1) of the Grameen Bank Ordinance.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>The petitioner has come in Court for judicial review of the orders/decisions of the Bangladesh Bank intimating the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank that as Professor Yunus has been continuing as Managing Director even after surpassing the retirement age of 60 years violating the service Regulations, his continuation as per decision of the Board for indefinite period without approval of the Bangladesh Bank is not legal and that he has not been legally working as Managing Director of the Bank. A judicial review differs from an appeal. The Court conducting a review is concerned to determine the lawfulness, but not the merits of the decision under review. Though the Court could quash the impugned decision, it could not substitute its own decision for that of the concerned Authority, the original decision maker. There is no dispute that the terms of appointment of Professor Yunus cover the provisions of Regulation of 1993. The petitionner is not in service of a private Bank, rather, he is in the service of a statutory Bank established under an Ordinance being controlled and regulated by the Government and therefore, the Board has no authority to fix his tenure of service for an indefinite period without approval of the Bangladesh Bank. The submission that the Prof. Muhammad Yunus was removed without affording any opportunity of being heard is contrary to the materials on record, specially when, in the eye of law, he was not ‘removed’ rather, he ceased to hold his office of Managing Director of Grameen Bank by operation of law, on his attaining the age of his superannuation for which it cannot be said that he was dealt with unfairly. Though Appellate Division do not approve of all the findings and observations of the High Court Division but the Appellate Division fully agree with its ultimate decision that there are no merits in the writ petitions. ...

Sinha, J:</strong><br/> <br/>Though these petitions arise out of two separate judgments, the writ petitions out of which these petitions arise have been instituted challenging the self-same orders over the same subject matter and the questions involve in these petitions being identical, these petitions are disposed of analogously. <br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong>     Before entering into the merit of the matter we would like to dispose of the application filed by Prof. Muhammad Yunus (petitioner) in Civil Petition No. 640 of 2011 for recalling the unsigned order dated 5th April, 2011. The leave petitions upon hearing the parties at length were dismissed in open Court on 5th April, 2011. Soon thereafter, the petitioner filed an application for rehearing of the matters after recalling the unsigned orders on the ground that all the learned counsel for the petitioner could not complete their submissions and therefore, for ends of justice the learned counsel may be afforded opportunity to make further submissions. The Supreme Court of Bangladesh (Appellate Division) Rules, 1988 does not provide any provision for rehearing of a matter which has been dismissed upon hearing the parties on merit other than hearing of a review petition under Order XXVI Part IV. What is more, the prayer for rehearing is not in conformity with Order XXVI Rule XI of Rules of 1988. As such, this petition is misconceived one. However, on consideration of the fact that three senior most learned counsel expressed their desire to make further submissions, we treat this case as an exceptional one and recall the unsigned orders in exercise of inherent powers of this Division.<br/> <br/><strong>3.     </strong>Short facts relevant for the disposal of these petitions are succinctly narrated thus:<br/>Grameen Bank Ordinance, 1983 (Ordinance No.XLVI/83), was promulgated on 4th September, 1983 with a view to establishing a Grameen Bank for providing credit facilities and other services to landless persons in rural areas and other matters connected there with. Section 14 authorizes the Government to appoint a Managing Director of the Bank. Accordingly Prof. Muhammad Yunus was appointed by Notification dated 13th September, 1983 as its Managing Director on the terms and conditions regulated by the Implementation Division's O.M. No. MF./ID/ V/N(A)-16/78/1199 dated 11th September, 1980.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>     The Ordinance was amended on 31st July, 1990, and by this amendment the Board of Directors (the Board) has been given the power to appoint the Managing Director "with prior approval of the Bangladesh Bank". In pursuance thereof as per proposal of the Bank by letter under memo dated 14th August, 1990 Prof. Muhammad Yunus was reappointed on certain terms and conditions, and one of which was to frame Regulations. Accordingly the Bank promulgated "গ্রামীন ব্যাংক চাকুরী বিধিমালা" which was published in the Official Gazette on 1st March, 1993.<br/> <br/><strong>5.     </strong>Bangladesh Bank Inspection Division-2 inspected the affairs of the Grameen Bank and in its report submitted on 31st December, 1999 it was pointed out in paragraph 20.4 that Prof. Muhammad Yunus and Mr. Md. Khaled Shams had been performing as Managing Director and Deputy Managing Director respectively who had attained the age of superannuation as they had exceeded the age of 60(sixty) years as per Regulations and that they had been performing their responsibilities as per decision of the Board for indefinite period.  This probably prompted the Bank to promulgate another Regulations regulating the terms and conditions for the appointment of Managing Director, which was published in the Official Gazette on 19th November, 2001. Under such circumstances, the Bangladesh Bank by its letter under memo dated 27th February, 2011 annexure-M to Writ Petition No.1890 of 2011, wrote to the respondent No.3 intimating that despite exceeding the retirement age of 60 years, Prof. Muhammad Yunus had been continuing as Managing Director of the Bank as per decision of the Board without approval of the Bangladesh Bank in accord-ance with section 14(1) of the Ordinance, that his continuation in such office was not legal and that he was not legally holding the office of Managing Director. On 2nd March, 2011 the Bangladesh Bank intimated the Chairman of the Grameen Bank that the continuation of Prof. Muhammad Yunus as the Managing Director was violation of section 14(1) of the Ordinance. <br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>     Prof. Muhammad Yunus challenged these two orders in Writ Petition No. 1980 of 2011 in the High Court Division claiming that he was appointed as Managing Director as per resolution of the Board in accordance with section 14(1) of the Ordinance, that the Grameen Bank Ordinance having not conferred any power upon the Bangladesh Bank to dictate or determine the terms and conditions under which the Managing Director would serve Grameen Bank, the impugned orders are unlawful, that the Grameen Bank Service Regulations, 1983 have no manner of applic-ation to Prof. Muhammad Yunus, that the Bangladesh Bank has not been invested with any authority to pass any order relieving the Managing Director of the Grameen Bank from service and that the removal was in violation of the principle of natural justice. 9(nine) Direct-ors of Grameen Bank, the petitioners in Civil Petition No.641 of 2011, moved another petition being Writ Petition No.1891 of 2011 in 7the High Court Division challenging the aforesaid two letters raising self-same grounds.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>     The High Court Division upon hearing the parties by two separate judgments dismi-ssed the writ petitions summarily. While dismissing the petition of Prof. Muhammad Yunus, the High Court Division noticed section 14(4) of the Ordinance and the Regul-ations of 1993, and came to the conclusion that he was performing as an officer of the Bank and therefore, his Service would be regulated by the Regulations of 1993, that after expiry of 60 years he was not legally entitled to continue as Managing Director of the Bank, that the resolution of the Board dated 28th July, 1999 allowing him to continue as Managing Director until the Board decides otherwise without prior approval of the Bangladesh Bank provided in section 14(1) of the Ordinance is illegal, that as Prof. Muhammad Yunus had been holding the office beyond the age of superannuation, the principle of  <em>audi alteram partem</em> would not be applicable and that the other petitioners had no locus-standi to maintain the writ petition challenging the impugned orders.  <br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>     We have perused the writ petitions along with annexures, the impugned judgments, the Ordinance and the Service Regulations. We have heard the learned counsel at length for days together. Dr. Kamal Hossain, learned counsel appearing for Prof. Muhammad Yunus argued:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>a) the petitioner had effectively been denied access to justice by the summary rejection of the Writ Petition and no affidavit-in-opposition was filed controverting averments made in the writ petition; <br/>b) this Division in exercising appellate jurisdiction should have examined the judgment, and the petitioner should have been given opportunity to point out the errors in the judgment of the High Court Division;<br/>c) a summary rejection by the High Court Division of the writ petition denied the petitioner an opportunity of having an   9 effective hearing at that level and also deprived the petitioner of having an effective hearing at the appellate level since in the judgment of the High Court Division all relevant materials had not been considered;<br/>d) the grounds taken in the writ petition challenging the legality of the impugned orders are based on issues relating to interpretation of law and where the construction of law is to be considered, a proper adjudication as required by all constitutions can not be done in a vacuum or without consideration of the factual context;<br/>e) the summary rejection of the writ petition in the circumstances is contrary to stablished norms of consti-tutional jurisprudence; and<br/>f) the mode of exercise of judicial power by the High Court Division is manifestly erroneous and amounts to a denial of access to justice to the petitioner. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>9.</strong>     In support of his contention, the learned counsel has cited the cases of General Medical Council V. Spackman (1943) AC 644-645, Kanda V. Government of Malaya (1962) AC Privy Council, 322,337, Bibi Quamrunnessa V. Bandar Building Co. Ltd. (unreported), Civil Appeal No.190 of 2003, Exen Industries V. CCIE, AIR 1971 SC 1025, Century Spinning V. Ulhasnagar Municipal Council AIR 1971 SC 1021 and Veerappa V. B.P. Dalal AIR 1975 SC .778.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>   Mr. Mahmudul Islam while endorsing the submissions of Dr. Hossain contended:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>a) even if the petitioner had no legal right to continue as Managing Director of the Bank, the principle of natural justice had to be followed before removing him from such office;<br/>b) this being an essential principle when a quasi-judicial body embarks on deter-mining disputes between the parties, it should not be denied to a person even if he had no legal right;<br/>c) there are inconsistent findings and observations in the judgment of the High Court Division and for correcting gross error committed by it, leave should be granted;<br/>d) in the Regulations of 1993 the expression 'ব্যাবসহাপনা পরিচালক'  and  'কর্মী'  having been separately defined in clause 2.0 (O) and (P) respectively, there is no scope to apply the Regulations for deciding the terms and conditions of the office of the Managing Director, inasmuch as, Prof. Muhammad Yunus is not an employee but the Managing Director, who has been appointing the workers and officers of the Bank as per Regulations; and<br/>e) the Bangladesh Bank having not raised any objection in the petitioner’s performing as Managing Director since 1999, such   12 inaction indicates that there is tacit consent by implication to continue such office.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>11.</strong>   Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud took us to the resolutions of the Board of Directors dated 28<sup>th</sup> July, 1999 and 31st December, 1999, the para wise reply of Grameen Bank in pursuance of Bangladesh Bank’s letter under memo dated 12th February, 2001, annexure-J, particularly paragraph 50.0 and the representation of the Grameen Bank in pursuance of the report of the Bangladesh Bank, annexure-M to the writ petition, and paragraph 3.0 including annexures-C and D and submitted;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>a) the last sentence of annexure-C is not applicable to the petitioner, inasmuch as, the petitioner’s terms of service will be regulated as per Regulations of 2001;<br/>b) since Prof. Muhammad Yunus has been holding the office of Managing Director for more than 10 years even after exceeding 60 years of age, his removal from office without proper notice is violative of the principle of natural justice, particularly when a stigma has been given to him in the impugned orders; and <br/>c) the petitioner having been appointed by the Board in accordance with section 14(1) of the Ordinance and approval having been sought by letter dated 14th August, 1990 and Bangla-desh Bank having accorded approval by its letter dated 14th August, 1990, the impugned orders are without jurisdiction. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>12.</strong>   Ms. Sara Hossain, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners in Civil Petition No.641 of 2011 took us to the various provisions of the Ordinance and submitted:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>a) the petitioners who constitute the majority of the Board of Directors being borrowers and share holders of Grameen Bank have their right to challenge the impugned orders, inasmuch as, they improved their own lives and those of their family and children as a result of their involvement with Grameen Bank and thus, they are certainly aggrieved persons within the meaning of Article 102 of the Constitution;<br/>b) the High Court Division acted illegally in rejecting their petition in-limine, inasmuch as, they filed the writ petition in their personal capacity and even though they have no personal interest in the post of Managing Director, they have the right to prevent the interference in the internal affairs of the Bank;<br/>c) the petitioners as Directors of the Bank filed the writ petition to protect their statutory right under the Grameen Bank Ordinance, it being not a public institution, the majority shares held by private citizens have the right to prevent usurpation of their statutory right with regard to the management and control of the Grameen Bank and to safe-guard their organization;<br/>d) the petitioners have been denied their right of hearing and thus the  High Court Division committed fundamental error in dismissing their writ petition summarily, and<br/>e)  Grameen Bank being a specialied Bank, Sui generis in the manner of its establishment and functioning, its operation is different from other Banks-the Board of the Bank, not the Government is the competent decision-making body.  </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>13.</strong>   Mr. Mahbubey Alam, learned Attorney General, on the other hand, supported the judgments of the High Court Division. According to the learned Attorney General, </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>(a)  Grameen Bank being a statutory Bank, the petitioner is a public servant within the meaning of Public Servants (Retirement Act) 1974, therefore, the Act of 1974 will be applicable to the case of the petitioner;<br/>(b)  since the petitioner has already attained the age of 60 years, he has been holding the office of Managing Director illegally and therefore, no show cause notice is required to be served upon him; and <br/>(c)  Rules of 2001 will not be applicable to the petitioner, which will be applicable for those who will be newly appointed as Managing Director.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>14.</strong>   Mr. Tawfiq Nawaz while endorsing the submissions of the learned Attorney General added:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>(a)    the petitioner having attained the age of 60 years before promulgation of Regulations of 2001, does not deserve a show cause notice before taking action against him, and the Regulations of 2001 will not be applicable to him;<br/>(b)    section 14(1) of the Ordinance clearly provides for approval of the Bangladesh Bank for appointment of a Managing Director and the petitioner having not challenged section 14, there is no scope to declare the impugned orders illegal  since no prior approval of the Bangladesh has been taken;<br/>(c)    the impugned orders are in fact not actions taken by the Bangladesh Bank; rather by these orders an intimation has been given to the Bank that Prof. Muhammad Yunus has been holding the office of Managing Director even after attaining the age of superannuation;<br/>(d)    the Grameen Bank being a statutory Bank, it comes within the definition of “statutory public authority” within the meaning of Article 152 of the Constitution and the petitioner having admitted in his affidavit that his profession is service, he is a public servant and therefore, he can not continue as Managing Director of the Bank even after crossing the age of 70 years;<br/>(e)    when a public servant attains the age of superannuation, the authority is not   required to issue any show cause notice for his removal other than to intimate him the correct position of his service and the same has been done in case of the petitioner; and<br/>(f)    even if it is assumed that no action has been taken against Prof. Muhammad Yunus even after expiry the age of 60 years that does not mean that the provisions of law which are applicable to the Bank and its employees have no force of law. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>15.</strong>   Upon hearing the parties and on consideration of the materials on record the following points have emerged for our consideration:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>a)   What is the status of Grameen Bank?<br/>b) What is the status of its Managing Director?<br/>c) What is the tenure of the Managing Director as per existing law?<br/>d) What are the terms and conditions regulating the office of the Managing Director?  <br/>e)  Whether the Board of Directors of the Bank can allow the Managing Director to continue for indefinite period without approval of the Bangladesh Bank, and<br/>f)  Whether the principle of audi alteram partem is applicable while removing an officer of a statutory organization who has been holding such office beyond the age of superannuation.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>16.</strong>   There is no dispute that Grameen Bank has been established by a statute with 60% paid-up share capital subscribed, managed or controlled by the Government and 25% by borrowers. The above ratio of share capital has been reduced to 25% and 75% respectively by an amendment by the Grameen Bank (Amend-ment) Ordinance, 1986. Be that as it may, this reduction of holding share capital will not make any difference regarding its status and the Government's power in the affairs of this statutory Bank. Section 5(2) of the Ordinance shows that the Board has no power to open regional or other offices without approval of the Bangladesh Bank. Even in case of increase of its   authorized capital, prior approval of the Government is necessary under section 6(3). It is also provided in section 7(2) that the Government may increase the paid up capital of the Bank from time to time in its sole discretion. Section 10(1) provides that the Chairman of the Board will be appointed by the Government, and three persons shall be appointed as Directors of the Bank by the Government under section 9(1)(a). The Managing Director will not be elected but be appointed by the Board with prior approval of the Government under section 14(1). Even the resignation of the Managing Director will not be effective until such resignation is accepted by the Government. These provisions undoubtly spel out that it is a statutory Bank and though the Board of Directors have been authorized to manage its affairs including the power to appoint the Managing Director but the Government and/or Bangladesh Bank is its ultimate controlling authority. <br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>   However, there is no dispute that Professor Muhammad Yunus undertook "Rural Economics Programme" at village Jobra being sponsored by the Department of Economics, University of Chittagong in 1976, when he was a professor of the said University. This project was adopted by the Bangladesh Bank which is evident from the 'Explanation' added at the bottom of the Ordinance. But at the same time, there is no gainsaying the fact that this Grameen Bank could not have been established unless professor Muhammad Yunus came forward with the ideas which he dreamt of providing 'micro credit' facilities to the rural poor while he was a professor of the University and approached the Government to set up Grameen Bank by an Ordinance. In view of the above admitted facts, we find no substance in the submission of the learned counsel that Professor Muhammad Yunus is the founder of the Bank and that Grameen Bank is a Private Bank. It may be said that he is the precursor for the establishment of the Bank and its founder Managing Director.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>   Admittedly Professor Muhammad Yunus was appointed as Managing Director initially in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Implementation Division's memo dated 11th September, 1980 of the Ministry of  Finance and Planning Division, Government of Bangladesh. He was reappointed on 25th August, 1990 on the following terms and conditions:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>a) his service conditions will be regulated as per Regulations to be framed in accordance with section 14(4) of the Ordinance;<br/>b) the Regulations will be effective after publishing them in the Official Gazette;<br/>c) Grameen Bank has been advised to take effective steps in this regard; and <br/>d) if the Regulations are inconsistent with the existing ones prior approval of the Bangladesh Bank will be necessary.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>19.</strong>   The petitioner did not file the Implementation Divisions memo dated 11th September, 1980, though in his reappointment letter there was clear stipulation that his terms and conditions of service would be regulated as per 'existing terms' until the Regulations are framed in exercise of powers under section 36, i.e. the Implementation Division's memo dated 11th September, 1980. In course of hearing we drew the attention of Dr. Hossain repeatedly about this letter for appraising us the initial terms and the status of the Managing Director. Dr. Hossain avoided to meet the query saying that Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud would meet all those queries on facts. When Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud argued on facts, he was asked to produce this memorandum or at least to intimate us the terms and conditions on which he was appointed as Managing Director. Mr. Mahmud’s response was that he would reply to our query later on but to our utter surprise, Mr. Mahmud concluded his submissions without meeting our query. <br/> <br/><strong>20.   </strong>The petitioner has come in Court for judicial review of the orders/decisions of the Bangladesh Bank intimating the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank that as Prof. Yunus has been continuing as Managing Director even after surpassing the retirement age of 60 years violating the service Regulations, his continuation as per decision of the Board for indefinite period without approval of the Bangladesh Bank is not legal and that he has not been legally working as Managing Director of the Bank. <br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>   Judicial review is different from an appeal. The Court hearing an appeal will normally have the right to decide the whole case again and, if it wishes, to substitute its own decision for that of the Court below. This is precisely where a judicial review differs from an appeal. The Court conducting a review is concerned to determine the lawfulness, but not the merits of the decision under review. The natural corollary to this is that though the Court could quash the impugned decision, it could not substitute its own decision for that of the concerned Authority, the original decision maker.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>   The governing principles of judicial review adopted by Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions V. Minister for the Civil Service (1984) 3 All ER 935 at 949 commands considerable respect.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"Judicial review has I think developed to a stage today when, without reiterating any analysis of the steps by which the development  has come about, one can conveniently classify under three heads the grounds on which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review. The first ground I would call 'illegality', the second irrationality' and the third 'procedural impropriety". </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>23.</strong>   Lord Diplock, explained the meaning of the expression 'illegality' in determining the lawfulness of the decision as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"By illegality as a ground for judicial review I mean that the decision-maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-making power and must give effect to it. Whether he has or not is par excellence a justi-ciable question to be decided, in the event of dispute, by those persons, the judges, by whom the judicial power of the state is exercisable." </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>24.</strong>   This test is two fold, as the decision maker (a) 'must understand' the relevant law orrectly, and (b) 'must give effect to it'. The decision- maker i.e. the Bangladesh Bank must comply with both these conditions.  Failure under either head will presumably be enough to entitle the Court to quash the decision. It is also pointed out by Lord Diplock that it is for the Court to decide whether the decision-maker has indeed complied with these conditions. Now the question is essentially whether the authority entrusted with the decision-making power has the right to decide the case 'wrongly' or whether any error of law automatically takes the decision outside the authority's jurisdiction. This takes us to consider the relevant provisions of law.<br/> <br/><strong>25.   </strong>Section 14(1) of the Ordinance states that the Managing Director of the Bank shall be appointed by the Board with prior approval of the Bangladesh Bank. Sub-section (4) provides that the Managing Director shall be the whole-time officer and Chief Executive of the Bank and shall serve under the Bank on such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by Regulations.  Section 15 also provides that the Managing Director shall perform functions as may be prescribed by the Regulations. The letter of reappointment dated 25th August, 1990, annexure-C, was issued in accordance with   27 sections 14(4) and 15. It has been specifically mentioned that till such Regulations are framed, the 'existing terms' will hold the field. Existing terms means the terms fixed in his initial appointment letter on 13th September, 1983. It is also seen that the Board made Regulations under the heading "গ্রামীন চাকুরী বিধিমালা" which had been published in the Gazette on 1st March, 1993.<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong>   Though it has been termed as Service Regulations, it is seen that apart from terms and conditions of service of the workers, staff and officers, this Regulations also provide the powers, the performance of functions and discharge of duties by the employees, staff and officers of the Bank. The inclusion of these provisions sufficiently indicate that the Regulations have been made for 'efficient conduct of the affairs of the Bank' as well. It may be said that it is a complete Code promulgated in accordance with the Ordinance for running the affairs of the Bank and that being the position, it can safely be concluded that this Regulations are applicable to all the employees including the officers of the Bank.   <br/> <br/><strong>27.</strong>   What's more, this Regulations have been promulgated within less than three years of the direction given by the Bangladesh Bank in annexure-C. Besides, in paragraph 2.0 of the re-appointment letter of the petitioner, annexure-D, it was pointed out that he would be treated as a regular 'officer' of the Bank, and in paragraph 3.0 it was clearly mentioned that he would draw monthly 'বেতন' (salary), and would also be provided with pension, gratuity along with other benefits as per prevailing rules. Pension benefits are given to the employees of the Government and other statutory bodies including a bank. Clause 2(P) defines 'কর্মী' (worker/employee) means all permanent and temporary officers and employees. Clause 2(X) defines 'বেতন' (salary) means monthly salary received by an employee sanctioned against his post or other equal financial benefits sanctioned. In paragraph 3.0, his monthly salary was fixed which is in accordance with clause 2(P). Clause 49.0 relates to gratuity and clause 51.0 relates to pension etc, which the petitioner is entitled to as per paragraph 9.0 of his appointment letter. Clause 50.0 states that the retirement age of an employee of the Bank is 60 years. There is, therefore, no dispute that the terms of appointment of Professor Yunus cover the provisions of these Regulations.<br/> <br/><strong>28.</strong>   It is argued that in the Regulations the expressions 'Managing Director' and 'Employee' having been separately defined in paragraphs 2(O) and 2(P) respectively, and as the Managing Director being the employer of the employees and officers, he should not be treated in the category of an employee. This submission is devoid of substance because, as mentioned above, Professor Yunus had not been elected Managing Director but appointed Managing Director with the status of a regular officer of the Bank and he had acquiesced to his such status as an officer of the Bank. Further, his power to appoint officers is a part of the functions of his job provided in section 15 read with clause 7.4 of the Regulations which will not make any difference in his status. This power of appointment was also given to other officers of the Bank before   30coming into force of the Regulations and powers of those officers had been retained in the proviso to clause 7.4 of the Regulations. This being the position if we accept the submission of the learned counsel, then the Regulations will not be applicable to them as well. Similar job descriptions and functions have also been allocated to branch managers, area managers, programme officers etc. in appendix-3 to the Regulations.<br/> <br/><strong>29.</strong>   There is no dispute that Professor Muhammad Yunus was reappointed by the Board with prior approval of the Bangladesh Bank on 25th August, 1990. The question then turns to be decided as to the tenure of such appointment. On this point there are inconsistent submissions from the Bar. It is firstly submitted, there is no fixed tenure and on the next breath, it is contended that the Board is the authority to decide the tenure, and at its 52nd meeting it has been decided that Professor Yunus would continue to perform as Managing Director until contrary is decided. Alternatively, it is argued that the terms and conditions including the tenure will be regulated as per Regulations of 2001 published in the Gazette on 19th November, 2001, annexure-H. We find fallacy in the submissions in view of the fact that the petitioner is not in service of a private Bank; rather, he is in the service of a statutory Bank, established under an Ordinance, being controlled and regulated by the Government and therefore, the Board has no authority to fix his tenure of service for an indefinite period without approval of the Bangladesh Bank. <br/> <br/><strong>30.</strong>   This resolution, according to the learned counsel, is in accordance with law and the Bangladesh Bank illegally interfered with the internal affairs of the Bank. The tenure including the terms and conditions will be governed by section 14 read with the Regulations made in exercise of powers under section 36. Assuming that the Regulations of 1993 will not be applicable to the petitioner, as argued, then the Implementation Division's memo dated 11th September, 1980 will hold the field since it was clearly pointed out in his reappointment letter that until the  Regulations are framed the ‘existing terms’ would govern his service, and if the Regulations as may be framed conflicts with the existing ones, prior approval of the Bangladesh Bank would be necessary. The Regulations of 2001 were framed long after the expiry of the retirement age of 60 years.<br/> <br/><strong>31.</strong>   We are of the view that since the petitioner seeks judicial review of the impugned orders of the Bangladesh Bank removing him from the post of Managing Director, he ought to have filed the Implementation Division’s memorandum which is relevant for deciding his status and the terms and conditions of his service.<br/> <br/><strong>32.</strong>   The said memorandum was issued by the Ministry of Finance fixing the pay scales of the Governor/Deputy Governor of Bangladesh Bank and Managing Directors of the Nationalised Banks and Financial Institutions and providing other related facilities and benefits, the relevant portion is reproduced below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH<br/>MINISTRY OF FINANCE<br/>IMPLEMENTATION DIVISION<br/>No. MF(ID)V/N(A)-16/78/1199   Dated 11.9.80   33<br/>OFFICE MEMORANDUM<br/>Sub: Pay scales of the Governor/Dy. Governor of Bangladesh Bank and Managing Directors of the Nationalised Banks &amp; Financial Instts.<br/>The undersigned is directed to say that the Government have been pleased to decide that the posts of Governor/Deputy Governor of Bangladesh Bank and the Managing Directors of Nationalised Banks and Financial Institutions named below will be placed in the New scales of pay and receive other allowances/facilities as shown below ..............."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>33.</strong>   The petitioner had been given the status of the Managing Director of a Nationalised Bank and therefore, the terms and conditions applicable to the Managing Director of a Nationalised Bank would apply to him. These terms and conditions have not been changed by the Bank by the Regulations or by the Board with the approval of the Bangladesh Bank. Therefore, we can safely infer that the petitioner has been performing as Managing Director for a tenure equivalent to those Managing Directors of Nationalised Banks. The  petitioner did not claim that he was not appointed on contract basis as per paragraph 7 of this memorandum, in which case, his service would have been "governed by their own terms of contract". He is a public servant plain and simple, and the age limit for retirement of a public servant will be applicable to him. In his appointment letter it was clearly pointed out that he would be treated as নিয়মিত কর্মকর্তা (regular officer) and that there would be a continuity of service. A public servant's retirement age has been fixed by statute and after expiry of his age of superannuation, he cannot continue in such office as of right, unless, the tenure of his service is extended by the authority. There is nothing on record to show that his service has been extended by the concerned authority.<br/> <br/><strong>34.   </strong>There is no explanation as to why the Grameen Bank did not frame separate Regulations determining the terms and conditions of the Managing Director at the time of framing the Regulations of 1993 if they are not applicable to him despite direction given by the Bangladesh Bank. Mr. Tawfiq Nawaz submitted that the Regulations of 2001 would not be applicable to the petitioner as he had already attained the age of 60 years on 28th June, 2000, long before coming into force of this Regulations on 19th November, 2001 and secondly,  these Regulations have been made providing the terms and conditions for those Managing Directors who will be appointed later on. In this connection, the learned counsel has drawn our attention to the preamble. In the preamble it has been stated Ordinance No.XLVI, 1983 এর ১৪ ধারার বিধান মোতাবেক  ব্যবসহাপনা পরিচালক নিয়োগের শর্তাবলী সংক্রামত্ম নিম্ন বর্ণিত নিম্নলিখিত রেগুলেশন প্রণীত হলো।” (emphasis added)<br/> <br/><strong>35.</strong>   The preamble of a statute is a prefactory statement at the beginning, following the title and preceding the enacting clause; it explains the policy and purpose, the reasons and motives for, and the objects sought to be accomplished by the enactment of the statute. Preamble has been regarded as of great importance as guides to construction.  In the preamble of the Regulations it has been stated in clear terms that those have been framed for regulating the terms of appointment of the Managing Director. While Professor   36 Yunus was performing as Managing Director these Regulations were framed. In view of the above, we find merit in the contention of Mr. Tawfiq Nawaz. <br/> <br/><strong>36.</strong>   Even if it is assumed that these Regulat-ions are applicable, the petitioner will not derive any benefit from them. The petitioner has not been reappointed after promulgation of the same with prior approval of the Bangladesh Bank. Secondly, clause 4.00 provides that the tenure of the office will not be more than five years, and the Board can reappoint the Managing Director for a fixed term on such new terms as will be decided at the time of reappointment. The tenure of five years expired in November, 2006 from the date of coming into force of these Regulations even if it is taken that the same are applicable to the petitioner. But the petitioner was neither appointed nor reappointed fixing his terms after coming into force of the said Regulations. Learned counsel for the petitioner fails to explain how these Regulations will regulate the terms and conditions of Professor Yunus? In view of the above, there is no doubt that Bangladesh  Bank removed the petitioner in exercise of its power in accordance with law.<br/> <br/><strong>37.</strong>   It is submitted that the Bangladesh Bank issued the impugned orders without affording Prof. Muhammad Yunus an opportunity of being heard and thus there is procedural impropriety in the impugned orders. This principle of natural justice has been laid down by Courts as being minimum protection of rights of the individual against the arbitrary decision taken by the quasi-judicial and administrative authority when making an order affecting ones rights. There is no dispute that whenever justice fails to achieve solemn purpose, natural justice is called in aid of legal justice. Natural justice relieves legal justice from unnecessary technicality. There is also no denial of the fact that the adherence to principle of natural justice is recognized by all civilized States which is of supreme importance when quasi-judicial body embarks on determining disputes between the parties, or any administrative action involving penal consequence is in issue. It is now well recognized that no one should be condemned unheard and a notice has to be served before any action is taken.<br/> <br/><strong>38.</strong>   First it has to be decided as to whether he was entitled to a notice when he ceased to hold office on attaining the age of retirement, on the operation of law. He was not terminated from service or retired compulsorily or removed from service for which he was entitled to a show cause notice. He was informed that as he had surpassed the age of uperannuation, he had no right to hold the office. This principle would apply only when the action was attended with penal consequences, which constituted punishment. In the facts of the given case it would not attract this principle. It is contended that an express stigma was attached to the order of removal and thus, the orders were violative to the principle of natural justice. As observed, as the petitioner was neither removed nor discharged or retired compulsorily it could have been inferred that the orders constituted no penal consequences so as to attract a notice. There is no aspersion or reflection on the conduct, efficiency or  the like, made in the orders, which would adversely affect his social status and therefore, we find no substance in the contention that a stigma was attached to the impugned orders. <br/> <br/><strong>39.</strong>   Provisions of Article 135(2) of the Constitution can be invoked by a person who holds any civil post in the service of the Republic but the petitioner being an officer of a statutory Bank did not come in the said category. Article 135(2) provides that no person shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause why that action should not be taken. Similar provision is provided in Article 311(2) of the Constitution of India. It has been held in different cases that compulsory retirement of an officer who has completed 25 years of service before superannuation would not attract Article 311(2) even though it is, in fact, ordered on the ground of misconduct, inefficiency or the like because in compulsory retirement, the Government servant does not lose any retirement benefits. Reference in this connection is the cases of  Mati Ram Deka V. NEF Railways, AIR 1964 S.C. 600 and Chief Justice of A.P. V. LVA Dixitulu, AIR 1979 S.C. 193. <br/> <br/><strong>40.</strong>   We noticed that before  the audit objection was raised by the Bangladesh Bank on 31st December, 1999, Prof. Muhammad Yunus had sufficient information that he would not eligible to continue as Managing Director as he would attain the age of superannuation in June 2000, as would be evident from annexure-F, the 52th meeting of the Board held on 28th July, 1999, otherwise there was no reason behind to discuss and adopt a resolution to the effect that while appointing Prof. Muhammad Yunus the Board did not fix the tenure and he would be entitled to continue until otherwise decided. Besides, in his letter dated 15th March, 2010 addressed to the Minister for Finance, which was reproduced in his supplementary affidavit dated 6th March, 2011, he expressed his intention to retire by handing over charge to the second generation. This letter indicated that he was convinced that age is the barrier to continue as Managing Director and accordingly he wanted  to become Chairman of the Bank, and desired an honourable transition of power. Therefore, he had sufficient knowledge that he had ceased to hold the office of Managing Director otherwise there was no reason for him to express his desire to handover the power. <br/> <br/><strong>41.</strong>   Even if it is assumed that the impugned orders of removal visited professor Yunus with the loss of office, the maxim  audi alteram partem can not have universal application. Rules of natural justice necessarily vary with the nature of the right and the attendant circumstances. Tucker L.J. said in Russell V. Duke of Norfolk (1949 1 All E R 109) “the requirements of natural justice must depend on the circumstances of the case, the nature of the enquiry, the rules under which the tribunal is acting, the subject matter that is being dealt with, and so forth.”  It has been argued in Uma Nath Pandey V. State of U.P., AIR 2009 SC 2375 by Dr. Arijit Pasayat, J. </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"Concept of natural justice has undergone a great deal of change in recent years. Rules   of natural justice are not rules embodied always expressly in a statute or in rules framed thereunder. They may be implied from the nature of the duty to be performed under a statute. What particular rule of natural justice should be implied and what its context should be in a given case must depend to a great extent on the facts and circumstances of that case, the frame work of the statute under which the enquiry is held. The old distinction between a judicial act and an administrative act has withered away. Even an administrative order which involves civil consequences must be consistent with the rules of natural justice. Expression 'civil consequences' encompasses infraction of not merely property or personal rights but of civil liberties, material deprivations, and non-pecuniary damages. In its wide umbrella comes everything that affects a citizen in his civil life."   </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>42.</strong>   After making above observation, the learned Judge travelled the globe to explore the principle and concluded:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"We may, however, point out that even in cases where the facts are not all admitted or beyond dispute, there is a considerable unanimity that the Courts can, in exercise of their 'discretion' refuse certiorari, prohibition, mandamus or injunction even though natural justice is not followed". </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>43.</strong>   In Rajendra Singh V. State of M.P. (1996) 5 SCC 460 it is stated:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"even in relation to statutory provisions requiring notice, a distinction is to be made between cases where the provision is intended for individual benefit and where a provision is intended to protect public interest. In the former case, it can be waived while in the case of the latter, it can not be waived". </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>44.</strong>   There are cases in which it is argued that if this principle is followed it will be rather useless formality as no fruitful purpose will be served in such cases this principle can not be adhered to. In M.C. Mehta V. Union of India (1999) 6 SCC 237 it was observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"Before we go into the final aspect of this contention, we would like to state that case relating to breach of natural justice do also occur where all facts are not admitted or are not all beyond dispute. In the context of those cases there is a considerable case-law and literature as to whether relief can be refused even if the court thinks that the case of the applicant is  not one of 'real substance' or that there is no substantial possibility of his success or that the result will not be different, even if natural justice is followed." </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>45.</strong>   Lord Woolf in Lloyd V. Mc Mohan (1987) 1 All ER 1118 has also not disfavoured refusal of discretion in certain cases of breach of natural justice. One argument has been made in Mc Carthy V. Grant, 1959 NZLE   451014 "it is sufficient for the applicant to show that there is 'real-likelihood-not certainly -of prejudice". Wade, Administrative Law, 5th Edn. Page 526-530 it has been stated that while futile writs may not be issued, a distinction has to be made according to the nature of the decision. We found that Prof. Muhammad Yunus was not condemned unheard. He had sufficient notice that he was holding the office of Managing Director of Grameen Bank without sanction of law as he had attained the age of superannuation in June, 2000, 10 years prior to the making of the impugned orders. Therefore, we find no merit in the contention of the learned counsel.<br/> <br/><strong>46.</strong>   In General Medical Council case (1943 AC 644), the question involved was "if any registered medical practitioner shall be convicted in England or Ireland of any felony or misdemeanour, or in Scotland of any crime or offence, or shall after due inquiry be judged by the General Council to have been guilty of infamous conduct in any professional respect, the General Council may, if they see fit, direct the registrar to erase the name of such medical practitioner from the register". Section 29 of the Medical Act, 1858 empowers the medical council to convict for felony or misdemeanour with a criminal conviction. In case of infamous conduct which is not connected with a criminal conviction, the decision of the council, if adverse to the practitioner, must be arrived at "after due inquiry". The question is whether the council in that case can be regarded having reached its adverse decision "after due inquiry" when it has refused to hear evidence tendered by the practitioner with a view to showing that he has not been guilty of the infamous conduct alleged. In the facts of the given case Lord Wright following the case of Rex V. Local Government Board (1914) 1KB 160 argued on consideration of an observation made in that case "contrary to natural justice" as an expression "sadly lacking in precision". "So it may be, and perhaps, it is not desirable to attempt to force it into any procrustean bed, but the statements which I have quoted may, at least, be taken to emphasize the essential requirements that the tribunal should be impartial and that the medical   practitioner who is impugned should be given a full and fair opportunity of being heard".<br/><br/>In Kanda V. Government of Federation of Malaya, 1962(AC) 322, two men were charged in the Supreme Court at Penag with uttering forged lottery tickets. The prosecution failed? Police officers as witnesses gave false evidence in trial. The two accused men including inspector Kanda were acquitted. The commissioner of police ordered an inquiry to be held. It reported that false evidence had been fabricated for use at the trial. Article 135(2) of the Constitution of Federation of Malaya provides "No member of such a service as aforesaid (the police service is one of these) shall be dismissed or reduce in rank without being given a reasonable opportunity of being heard". Inspector Kanda was dismissed on 7th July, 1958. In the context of the matter, it was observed "if the right to be heard is to be a real right which is worth anything, it must carry with it a right in the accused man to know the case which is made against him. He must know what evidence has been given and what statements have been made affecting him: and then he must be given a fair opportunity to correct or contradict them. It follows, of course, that the judge or whoever has to adjudicate must not hear evidence or receive representations from one side behind the back of the other".<br/>In Century Spinning and Manufacturing Company Case AIR 1971 SC (1021), the company set up a factory within the limits of Bombay Industrial area. On the representation of the company the Government of Bombay published a notification including the company's area in which the industrial area was set up proclaiming that the industrial area to be excluded from municipal jurisdiction and on the representation of the municipality, the Government withdrew the said notification on condition that the municipality would exempt existing factories from payment of octroi for 7 years. The municipality thereafter ignoring the advise of the government informed that it would consider on merits any representation of a tax prayer for exemption from payment of octroi. Thereafter the Municipality sought to levy octroi duty and to recover octroi duty from the company. In the context of the matter, the Supreme Court observed "the High Court may, in exercise of its discretion, decline to excise its extra-ordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. But the discretion is judicial: if the petitioner makes a claim which is frivolous, vexatious, or prima facie unjust, or may not appropriately be tried in a petition invoking extra-ordinary jurisdiction, the Court may decline to entertain the petition. But a party claiming to be aggrieved by the action of a public body or authority on the plea that the action is unlawful, high-handed, arbitrary or unjust is entitled to a hearing of its petition on the merits. Apparently the petition filed by the Company did not raise any complicated questions of fact for determination, and the claim could not be characterised as frivolous, vexatious or unjust. The High Court has given no reasons for dismissing the petition in limine, and on a consideration of the averments in the petition and the materials placed before the Court we are satisfied that the Company was entitled to have its grievance against   the action of the Municipality, which was prima-facie unjust, tried".<br/> <br/><strong>47.</strong>   In Veerapa Rachappa Saboji, (AIR 1975 SC 773), the Supreme Court observed "we do not think the High Court Division was right in rejecting the petition of the appellant in limine. The grounds of challenge taken by the appellant in the petition could not be said to be frivolous so as to merit summary rejection. They did require consideration, and particularly the first ground raised an issue of some importance depending on the true construction of Rule 4(2)(iv) of the Bombay Judicial Service Recruitment Rules, 1956. The High Court ought, therefore, to have admitted the petition and issued a rule so that the grounds of challenge set out in the petition could be examined on merits. No disputed questions of fact appeared to arise in the petition and in any event until a return was filed by the respondents, it could not be said whether the controversy between the parties would involve any disputed questions of fact. There was, therefore, no point in refusing to entertain the petition on merits   and referring the appellant to a suit. We must in the circumstances, set aside the order of summary reject-ion passed by the High Court and remand the petition to the High Court with a direction to admit it and to issue a rule to the respondents".<br/> <br/><strong>48.</strong>   We do not dispute the statement of law argued in the cases referred to by Dr. Hossain. These cases are quite distinguishable and not applicable in this case. No case can be an authority on facts. We find no substance in the submission that the High Court Division acted illegally in dismissing the petitions, inasmuch as, the petitions do not involve issues relating to interpretation and construction of law.<br/> <br/><strong>49.</strong>   Now the question is after expressing the desire to retire about one year before making of the impugned orders, the petitioner can challenge the impugned orders? When he has been convinced that he has no legal sanction of law to hold on the office, he has no right   to challenge the order of removal. In course of hearing learned counsel also indicated that there is still scope for honourable transition of power if the petitioner is appointed as chairman of the Bank by the Government considering his social status and contribution towards the Bank, and this can be possible if this Division makes observation in this regard. It is the discretionary power of the Govern-ment to appoint the Chairman under the Ordinance and it is not within our jurisdiction. Since the impugned orders were made on 27th February, 2011 after about one year of writing of the above letter, the issuance of prior notice, in our view, will be an unnecessary exercise. Therefore, the submission that the Prof. Muhammad Yunus was removed without affording any opportunity of being heard is contrary to the materials on record, specially when, in the eye of law, he was not ‘removed’ rather, he ceased to hold his office of Managing Director of Grameen Bank by operation of law, on his attaining the age of his superannuation. On these facts, it cannot be said that he was dealt with unfairly. <br/> <br/><strong>50.</strong>   Next point is whether the High Court Division acted illegally in dismissing the writ petitions summarily and thereby denied the petitioner access to  justice. The main thrust of Dr. Hossain is that the High Court Division ought to have admitted the petitions and should have decided the matters on the basis of the affidavit-in-opposition. This lead us to decide whether the admission of a writ petition, irrespective of its merit, is a sine-qua-non. The power of the High Court Division to issue writ under Article 102 can be exercised for the enforcement of fundamental rights, as well as, of non-fundamental legal rights where the action taken is procedurally ultra vires or where the authority being under an obligation to act judicially, or even quasi judicially, passes an order which is in violation of the principle of natural justice, for safeguarding such fundamental rights of the aggrieved person. When all the facts are on record and the law is clear on the subject, the exercise of jurisdiction in such a case is uncalled for. <br/> <br/><strong>51.</strong>   Similarly, in cases where the question of law or constitutionality urged can be determined only upon investigation into disputed questions of fact, for which there are no materials on the record, or where  the facts stated in the petition do not ex facie support the petitioner’s case, but not otherwise or where the petitioner seeks to secure unjust gain, or where the quasi-judicial authority acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or in contravention of the principle of natural justice, the exercise of power may be refused. We have observed above, there was no infraction of any right of the petitioner as he was holding and continuing in the office of Managing Director of a statutory bank without any legal sanction. Or in the alternative, he has no legal authority to hold the office of Managing Director as he has no legal basis to continue in such office after attaining the age of superannuation. In the absence of violation of any mandatory provision of law, the Court will not come in aid to the petitioner as he is a disqualified person to continue in the office of Managing Director. <br/> <br/><strong>52.</strong>   Prof. Muhammad Yunus is a nobel laureate. He is a respectable person not only in Bangladesh but all over the world. He was initially appointed as Managing   Director of Grameen Bank by the Government and subsequently the Board reappointed him with prior approval of the Bangladesh Bank. Under such circumstances, the observations of the High Court Division that "a 'squatter' or a 'trespasser' or a 'usurper' cannot maintain a writ petition under Article 102" are totally uncalled for in this case and the petitioner was illegally compared with litigants like "squatter, trespasser, usurper". Prof. Muhammad Yunus is neither a 'squatter' nor a 'trespasser' or a 'usurper' of Grameen Bank in any sense. Rather he is the person on whose ideas and innovative projects for extending collateral free small loans to the rural people, the Bank has been established and it has achieved the prestigious nobel prize as a recognition of its phenomenal success. Therefore, the unnecessary observations as quoted above are totally derogatory which are hereby expunged. It is hoped that the High Court Division should be cautious in future in making any unhealthy observation against any litigant who has   come to Court for justice and not for seeking derogatory remarks instead. <br/> <br/><strong>53.</strong>   It is to be remembered that Judges administer justice. In order to do justice, the first and foremost expectation from them is to be just. This expectation itself is the fountain source of all that can be put in the realm of canons of judicial ethics. A Judge can not have any predisposed state of mind. His judgment would not be actuated by concerns of private interests or considerations. He has to be decisive. His every action and every word–spoken or written, must show and reflect correctly that he holds the office as a public trust and he is determined to strive continuously to enhance and maintain the people’s confidence in the judicial system. Learning, personality, manners  and stature in the judicial functioning matter. A Judge is as much respected as he respects the law, justice, equity and good conscience, and above all serves and seen to serve the cause of justice. It is desirable that the High Court Division should not use such unsophisticated words against a respectable person like Prof. Muhammad Yunus. The language of the Court should be dignified and the findings should confine to the issues involved in the matter. <br/> <br/><strong>54.</strong>   Like a Judge, a lawyer is a functionary of the judicial system with powers and duties as important as those of Judges. Lawyers are an important limb in the administration of justice.  Their duty to the cause of justice is even superior. Their first obligation is to assist the Courts to the best of their ability so that justice can be done, so much so that only the legal profession is deservingly called a learned profession. It has high standards to keep abreast. That is why the profession commands respect. A lawyer’s advanced education, training, knowledge and skill in the field of law, apart from his duty to the client, are the attributes to his tradition in the practice of law. Instances are not rare to find where lawyers in their over-zealousness to protect the interest of their clients have chosen to go over-board to the extent of submitting misleading facts and law. In the words of Justice Sir Maurice Gwyer, “Every member of the Bar is   a trustee for the honour and prestige of the profession as a whole.” He said, every member of the Bar must bear in mind that it is expected of him that “never by any act or word of his will he show himself unworthy of the great tradition which he has inherited.”<br/> <br/><strong>55.</strong>   We would like to observe that the writ petition filed by 9(nine) Directors is not maintainable on two grounds firstly, they are not 'aggrieved persons' within the meaning of Article 102 of the Constitution and secondly, since the aggrieved person Prof. Muhammad Yunus having challenged the impugned orders himself, they have no locus-standi to challenge the same orders by a separate petition for, if such process is allowed multiplicity of proceedings would crop up and there would be likelihood of conflicting decisions over the same subject matter, in which event, instead of doing justice, the ends of justice would be defeated. The High Court Division declared the Regulations of 2001 being inconsistent with section 14 of the Ordinance invalid. True, a Subordinate law cannot supersede the parent law but since no rule was issued in these matters, the High Court Division is not justified in declaring Regulations of 2001 invalid.<br/> <br/><strong>56.</strong>   Though we do not approve of all the findings and observations of the High Court Division, we fully agree with its ultimate decision that there are no merits in the writ petitions. Thus, these petitions merit no consideration which are dismissed with the above observations.<br/> <br/>        The parties would bear their respective costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Amin Iqbal Corporation and others for realization of Tk. 15,77,113.50 and Other Suit no. 2 of 1994 filed by M/S Amin Iqbal Corporation against the Pubali Bank Ltd. for a counter claim of Tk. 57,08,529.17 over the same dispute, which were heard analogous.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong>         Precisely, the relevant facts are that the Pubali Bank Ltd. instituted the Money Suit no.  181 of 1988 alleging in the plaint that the defendant No. 1/S. Amin   Iqbal Corporation was Proprietary firm dealing with Sewing Machine and the defendants 2-3 used to carry on business through it, and they maintained a current account in the name of defendant No. l with the plaintiff-Bank. The defendant No. 3 being operator of the account, approached the Bank for opening Letters of Credit (L.C.) to import 457 packages of household Sewing Machine from Taiwan. Accordingly, the plaintiff-Bank, opened two Letters of Credit on 16.4.75 and 1.12.75 in the name of the defendant No. l M/S. Amin Iqbal Corporation    for the amounts of #3,672.30 and #2,849.25 British Pound respectively. The documents were executed by the defendant no.3 in the name of defendant No. l. The   imported   goods covered   by the Letters of Credit duly arrived at the Chittagong Port.  On receipt of the shipping documents,   the  plaintiff-Bank requested the defendant  to retire the same on payment of the plaintiffs dues. But they did not respond. Subsequently, the defendants requested the plaintiff-Bank to retire the documents and clear the imported goods through its own clearing and forwarding agent. Thereafter, the plaintiff-Bank had to clear those goods on payment of necessary custom duty and other charges, and stored those imported items in the godown of the plaintiffs Bank. Against the expenditure on account of sales, tax, duties and other charges for clearance of the goods, the plaintiff opened two merchandise accounts namely, L.A.M account no. 21 of 1976 and 28 of 1976. Then it became obligatory on the part of the defendants to take delivery of the goods on payment of the outstanding dues in the said L.A.M. accounts. But inspite of repeated requests by personal approach and in writing, they failed to take delivery of those goods from the godown and adjust their liabilities. Since the value of the goods was  deteriorate-ing  due  to  prolonged  storage,  the plaintiff Bank had to sell out those goods by public auction after observing necessary formalities for a total sum of Tk. 2,80,000,/ and credited the same in the respective L.A.M. accounts towards partial adjustment of the defendants' liabilities in accordance with Rules. Thereafter, the plaintiff-Bank started demanding the balance amount from the defendants and issued lawyer's notice demanding payment. On receipt of the notice, although the defendants made promise from time to time to adjust the liabilities, ultimately they did not pay any amount of money to the Bank. The defendants' total liabilities stood at Tk. 15,77,113.50 as calculated on 30.11.88 together with interest and incidental charges. At last on 16.8.87, the defendants were served with legal notice for payment, and on 5.12.88 an F.D.R. of the Defendant No. 2 available in the Bank was adjusted in the L.A.M. account no. 21 of 1976. The plaintiff -Bank thereafter, filed the suit for the realisation of  remain-ing balance amounting to Tk. 15,77,113.50 and also prayed for penal interest thereon   at the rate of 20%  per annum from the date of filing the suit till realisation along with the cost of the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>         The defendants 1-3 contested the suit by filing a written statement admitting that the defendant No. l was a Small industrial enterprise   while the defendants 2-3 were its owner and Managing Director respectively. It is contented interalia that the defendant No. 2 being entrusted to operate the business of the defendant No. l, opened a current account bearing no. 2683 and subsequently opened two Letter of Credits   for 3,672.30 and 2,849.25 British pound for the purpose of importing goods from Taiwan and that the shipping documents and though the imported goods duly reached, the defendants were not informed anything about the same. That the defendant No. 3 went to the Pubali Bank to get information about the consignment under the L.Cs, but the Bank maintained silence. The defendant No. 3 came to know that the two ships carrying those imported goods had already left the Chittagong Port and as such., he wrote letters including the letters dated 15.3.76 and 28.6.76 to the Bank to get the goods released, but the Bank did not make any reply. It is contended further that Mr. Bose an employee of the Bank misbehaved with him when he approached to the Bank personally.  Subsequently, the defendants approached to the Bank to open another Letter of Credit for the years 1976-1977 to run the business, but the Bank refused and did not even return the import license of the defendants preventing them from operating their business by opening Letter of Credit in another Bank. The plaintiff at first sent a letter dated 6.11.86 to the defendants informing about the import consignment, auction sale of the goods and claimed an amount of Tk. 4,71,156.60. The defendants came to know that the imported goods were sold by the Bank on auction on 18.9.84. As the plaintiff-Bank failed to  make any amicable settlement of the dispute on 22.7.91, the defendants instituted the Other Suit No. 25 of  1992(subsequently renumbered as Other Suit no. 2 of 1994) for a declaratory decree and compensation of  Tk. 5,08,529.17 on different counts. So the suit of the plaintiff- Bank is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>         The defendants 1-3 of the previously filed Money Suit also instituted Other Suit no. 25 of 1992 subsequently renumbered as Other Suit No. 2 of 1994 against the Pubali Bank for getting compensation of Tk. 57, 8,529.17 as a counter claimed as evident from the written statement filed in Money Suit no. 181 of 1988. The defendants being plaintiffs in the Money Suit also filed written statement in that Other Suit denying the plaint case and narrating the same facts of their plaint as stated above. So, we do not feel it necessary to state elaborate same facts   of the written Statement and plaint of the subsequent suit to avoid repetition.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>         The trial Court appears to have framed the following issues for adjudication of both the suits:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>(1)        Are the suits of the plaintiffs maintainable in the represent form?<br/>(2)        Whether the plaintiffs have cause of action for filing the suits?<br/>(3)        Are the plaintiffs of the respective suits entitled to get decree?<br/>(4)        To what the relief are the plaintiffs entitled?</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>6.</strong>         At the trial, the plaintiff -Bank examined 2 P.Ws. and the defendants M/S. Amin Iqbal Corporation and others examined 1 D.W., and series of documents submitted by the both the parties were admitted in evidence with exhibit marks.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>         Considering the facts, circumstances and evidence on the record, the learned Subordinate Judge, First Court, Artha Rin Adalat, Chittagong passed the impugned analogous judgment and decree dated 18.5.96 dismissing the Money Suit no. 181 of 1988 without cost and decreed Other Suit no. 2 of 92 with costs directing the defendant Pubali Bank to pay Tk. 15,00,000(fifteen lac) to the plaintiff M/S. Amin Iqbal Corporation and others as compensation within 6 months.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>         Being aggrieved, the Pubali Bank (plaintiff in the Money Suit and the defendant in the Other Suit) preferred this appeal.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>         Mr. Zakir Hossain Mazumdar, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant-Bank, submits that the trial Court being Artha Rin Adalat had no jurisdiction to entertain Other Suit no. 2 of 1994 filed in the Court of Subordinate Judge and hold trial of the same together with the suit filed by the financial institution. Because a case pending in the Artha Rin Adalat under the special law cannot be heard analogous with a suit pending in any Court created by the general law. In support of his submission , the learned Advocate has relied upon the case of Sultana Jute Mills Ltd. and others -Vs- Agrani Bank and others reported in 14 BLD(AD)- 196 and another case decision reported in 22 BLD(HCD)-127. He submits that both the cited cases are related to Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 1990 under which the instant case of the Bank was dealt with at the earlier stage. It is further submitted that there is also specific bar under section 18(2) of the existing Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 to try a suit instituted under the general law by the Artha Rin Adalat. So, the trial Judge, according to him, exercised jurisdiction not vested on it by the law and the impugned judgment and decree so far it relates to Other Suit no. 2 of 94 is illegal, void and without jurisdiction and as such, it is liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>       As regards the judgment and decree dismissing Money Suit no. 181 of 1988, the learned Advocate submits that the trial Court did not consider series of exhibited documents submitted by the Bank and as such, erroneously found that the defendants were not informed about the consignment and that the suit was barred by limitation. That the plaint has clearly disclosed cause of action for filing of the suit from which limitation should run. The learned Advocate has referred to the Exhibit-l(Ga) to show that on 6.11.86 an elaborate letter was issued by the Bank to the plaintiff about the consignment asking to clear dues of L.A.M. accounts with reference to the defendants’ letter dated 26.1.86 (Exhibit-5(Gha). It is submitted   that so many correspondences were made with the defendants regarding the matter and as such, it is down right falsehood to say that the defendants were totally in the dark about the release of imported goods by the Bank. Rather on the request of the defendants, the Bank had to clear the goods on payment of custom duty, tax and other charges, and store the same in the godown for a long time. But the defendants, having full knowledge, did not come to release the goods on payment of dues payable to the Bank. As a result, those goods were sold in public auction to the highest bidder and after partial adjustment of the dues by the sale proceeds and F.D.R. money of the defendant No. 2; the Bank lawfully filed the suit for realisation of the remaining balance. It is submitted that there is no earthly reason to refuse the genuine claim of the Bank and dismiss the Money Suit. The learned Advocate has relied on the Bank statement (Exhibit-4) to prove the outstay-nding dues and preyed for decree in Money Suit on setting aside the judgment of dismissal. He has also prayed for setting aside the judgment and decree so far it relates to Other Suit no. 2 of 1994.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>       None appeared on behalf of the respondents on several dates when hearing was going on.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>       We have gone through the impugned judgment, oral and   documentary   evidence      available   on   record   and considered other attending; facts and circumstances of this case.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>       Admittedly, the defendants opened two Letter of Credits (L.C.) in the Pubali Bank on 16.4.75 and 1.12.75 in the name of the defendant No. l for importing 457 packages of household Sewing Machine components from Taiwan, and those goods arrived at the Chittagong port in due time by two different ships. It appears that the plaintiff –Bank thereafter issued series of letters of addressing the defendants on various dates ranging from 1976 to 1987, which are in Exhibits-1,2 and 5 series. Those documents show that the Pubali Bank requested the defendants to retire the L.C. documents on payment of the dues and receive the imported goods, but the defendants did not. Exhibit- l(Kha), a letter dated 11.9.85 and Exhibit-l(Cha), a letter dated 18.12.76 along with so many other letters in the exhibits show that the Bank requested the defendants time and again to take delivery of the consignment on payment of the bills.It transpires from the Exhibit- l(Ga), a letter dated 6.11.86 that the defendants also made a reply to the some letters of the Bank requesting it to clear the consignment by a letter dated 3.2.77 and keep the goods in the Bank's godown. It appears that they also assured the Bank to receive the goods on payment of the dues positively by 30.6.80, but ultimately they did not. A letter dated 26.1.1986 (Exhibit-S(Gha) page 57 of the P.B.) shows that the defendants also sent reply to the letter of the Bank regarding the subject matter in , disputes. So, it is not an acceptable contention that the defendants were not aware of the arrival of goods and subsequent release of the same by the Bank and after keeping in godown for about 9 years sold the same in public auction without their knowledge. In fact, after keeping the goods in the Bank's godown for a long time, the Bank was ultimately compelled to sell the same on auction.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>       Exhibit-3 series are tender notices published in the daily Ittefaque on 1.6.82 and the particulars of the imported goods for auction sale were also made known to all concern and those were sold to the highest bidder in accordance with law, as the importer did not turn up to receive the goods from the Bank's godown. It is evident that the imported goods arrived in Chittagong Port in the year 1975 and it was disposed of by open public auction in the year 1984 i.e. after about 9 years. It also transpires that the sale proceed of the goods .were duly adjusted in the L.A.M. accounts no. 21 of 1976 and 28 of 1976. Exhibit-4 is the Bank statement of those L.A.M. accounts and it shows that on 30.11.88, the balance in the L.A.M. account no. 21 of 1976 and 28 of 1976 stood at Tk. 8,90,542.50 and 6,86,571/- respectively in total balance amount was Tk. 15,77,113.50 and accordingly, the plaintiff-Bank appears to have instituted the suit for realization. of the said amount along with interest thereon till realisation.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>       The learned Judge of the Court below could not detect any mistake in calculating the balance as shown in statement of the Bank (Exhibit-4). The defendants contested the Money Suit in the Court below, but could not specifically identify any mistake in calculating the balance payable amount, for which, the suit was filed by the Bank. The learned Judge of the Court below appears to have avoided in taking consideration of the pleadings and evidence available in favour of the plaintiff-Bank. If those are considered properly, there is no reason to dismiss the suit. In case, the Money Suit succeeds, the defendants cannot get any compensation in the Other Suit tiled by them. The plaint of the Other Suit no. 2 of 1994 shows that the defendants set up a counter claim of Tk. 57,08,529.17 due to their loss in the  business and damages for a period of 15 years. Apparently the nature of claims were baseless and there is hardly any foundation in the evidence as well. But unfortunately, the learned Judge of the trial court accepted the contentions of the defendants in an arbitrary manner and decreed their suit in part awarding compensation for on amount of Tk. 15,00,000/-, our considered view is that the defendants' suit for compensation and damages as set up in Other Suit no. 2 of 94 has no merit to succeed.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>       Apart from the merit of the suit,   the learned Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat has no jurisdiction to entertain Other Suit no. 2 of 94 and give hearing of the said suit under general law alongwith the Money Suit filed by the financial institution under the special law. It is legally barred and he cannot hold trial of any other suit of the Civil Court unless it is filed by any financial institution for recovery of loan under the Artha Rin Addalat Ain. In this respect we rely upon the case of Sultana Jute Mills Ltd. and others-Vs- Agrani Bank and others reported in 14 BLD(AD)-196 wherein it was decided that the Artha Rin Adalat Ain 1990 does not give Artha Rin Adalat any jurisdiction to adjudicate  upon any matter other than that provided in  section 5(l) of the said Ain. It has been well settled that the defendants cannot also claim a set-off and make out a case of counter claim in a suit filed under the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 1990. Under the existing Artha Rin Addalat Ain 2003  section 18 (2) also stands as a clear bar to entertain any suit Or counter cliam against the claim of the financial institution.  The relevant  subsection 2 section 18 runs as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">কোন ঋণগ্রহীতা, কোন আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠানের বিরুদ্ধে, এই আইনের অধীন আদালতে, সংশ্লিষ্ট ঋণ হইতে উদ্ভূত কোন বিষয়, কোন প্রতিকার দাবী করিয়া মামলা দায়ের করিতে পারিবেন না, এবং ঋণগ্রহীতা-বিবাদী, বাদী- আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠান কর্তৃক দায়েরকৃত মামলা লিখিত জবাব দাখিল করিয়া, উক্ত লিখিত জবাবে প্রতিগণন (Set-Off) বা পাল্টাদাবী (counter claim) অন্তর্ভুক্ত করিতে পারিবেন না</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong>17.</strong>       It transpires from the L.C.Rs. that the other suit No. 25 of 1992 was filed before the 2nd court subordinate judge, Chittagong under the general law and it was not even filed before the Artha Rin Addalat or commercial court. Therefore, the learned Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat, appears to have assumed illegal jurisdiction over the said other suit and held the trial of the said civil suit without having any jurisdiction.        <br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>       Generally if a suit is tried by a Court without having jurisdiction, the same is required to be sent to a competent Court having jurisdiction to hold trial and make disposal of   the suit afresh. But in the instant Other Suit no. 2 of 94, we have already considered merit of the suit and seen that when the Money Suit no. 181 of 1988 succeeds, the Other Suit no. 2 of 1994 must fail having no other third course. Since we have reached to such a finding, sending back Other Suit no. 2 of 1994 to the appropriate Civil Court for retrial would be useless and unnecessary time consuming and a mere futile exercise. So, the Other Suit no. 2 of 94 is also going to be dismissed in the appeal.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>       The learned trial Judge appears to have dismissed the  Money Suit of the Bank on another ground that it was berred by law of limitation, though no such issue was  raised by the parties  and framed before trial. However, it is true that the Money Suit was not filed within three years from the date of auction sale of the imported goods in the month of September, 1984. But it appears that subsequently FDR. -money of the defendant 2 was adjusted with the balance and several correspondences were going on to settle up the dispute amicably. Paragraph -11 of the plaint has clearly disclosed cause of action for the Money Suit. It appears that on 5.12.88, the F.D.R.-money belonging to the defendant 2 was at last adjusted with the balance amount. So the matter was not closed before that date. Moreover, last correspondence with the defendant was made on 6.11.88 and   as the defendant did not comply with the request to pay the balance amount of money, the plaintiff-Bank had to file the Money Suit on 24.12.88. Therefore, the question of barring the suit by article 57 of the Limitation Act, as found by the trial Court does not arise. It is a wrong finding of the trial Court. As such, we are inclined to hold that the money suit was not barred by the law of limitation.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>       It appears that in money suit No. 181 of 88 the plaintiff-bank also has prayed for interest at the rate of 20% per annum on the principal amount from the date of filing of the suit till realisation. But we are not inclined to impose such an exorbitant rate of interest as claimed by the plaintiff. Keeping consistency with the section 50(2) of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003, we are inclined to award simple interest at the rate of 12% per annum on the principal amount from the date of filing the suit till realisation subject to maximum payable under section 47 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003. It means that the simple interest payable shall not exceed 200% of the original claim.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>       Having due regard to the aforesaid observations and findings, we are inclined to hold that the impugned judgment and decree suffers from gross mistake and legal infirmity, and as such, the same is liable to be set aside. Consequently, the impugned analogous judgment passed in the two suits may be reversed.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>       Consequently, the First Appeal succeeds.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>       Court fees paid on the memorandum of the appeal is sufficient.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong>       In the result, the First Appeal no. 219 of 1996 is allowed without any order as to costs. The impugned judgment and decree dated 18.5.96 passed analogous in Money Suit no. 181 of 1988 and Other Suit no. 2 of 1994 are set aside. The Money Suit no. 181 of 1988 is decreed on contest with cost. The plaintiff-Pubali Bank  is entitled to get Tk. 15,77,1 13.50 from the defendants alongwith simple interest thereon at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of filing the suit till realisation subject to the restriction          imposed   under section 47 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003. The interest   amount shall not exceed 200% of the Principal amount in any case. Accordingly, the defendants Are directed to pay the said amount to the plaintiff- Bank within 60(sixty) days from this date, failing which The plaintiff shall be entitled to get the same the same through the court in accordance with law.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong>       The Other Suit No. 2 of 1994 is dismissed without any order as to costs. The analogous judgment and decree so far it relates to that suit are hereby set aside.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>Send down the L.C.Rs. along with a copy of the judgment to the Court below immediately.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"> </div></div></div></div>

The statement of the victims made under section 164 of the code of Criminal Procedure, reveal that they are not abducted by the accused persons; rather they went away on their own volition. There is no evidence whatsoever to indicate that they were “bought” or “sold” or “exported” or “imported” or “transferred” for any such illegal or immoral act, as contemplated in section 8 of the Ain of 1995.

Rafique and Most. Shahida Khanun, husband and wife and both absconding, were tried in Nari-O-Shishu Case No. 26 of 1999 under sections 8 and 12 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain, 1995 and sentenced thereunder to death by the learned Judge, Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal No. 2, Chandpur who has submitted Death Reference No. 128 of 2004 under section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for confirmation of the sentence of death imposed upon both the absconding condemned prisoners.<br/> <br/>Criminal Appeal No. 3520 of 2004 is at the instance of Md. Idris Mia, who was tried along with condemned prisoners in the aforesaid case and convicted thereunder and sentenced to imprisonment for life.<br/> <br/>Briefly stated, the relevant facts are as under:<br/>      On 29.01.99, an FIR was lodged by one Md. Mostafa Kamal alleging, inter alia, that his wife Marzina Begum and his 4 year old son Jony were rescued along with Shahid Mia, Md. Kamal Hossain and Nazma Begum from the house of one Hamid Ali in village Paragaon under Kachua Police Station in Chandpur District. The informant’s wife had left home 10 days earlier following an altercation with him and went to Chittagong to her aunt’s house, but finding no one there, she returned home. On her way back, she met condemned prisoner Rafique who enticed her to go with him on the assurance of being sent to Pakistan with a job. Rafique also obtained her thumb impression on some blank papers in order to secure her divorce from the informant. During the next 10 days, she was kept in confinement at different places. The informant came to know that his wife, along with some others, were being detained in the said house of Hamid Ali at Paragaon village whereupon, being accompa-nied by the local Chowkider Md. Abdul Hakim (PW 2), Md. Momtaz Uddin (PW 6), Rakhal Chandra Shil (PW 5) and other local elites, he went to the said house of Hamid Ali and rescued his wife along with three other persons from there. However, on getting scent of their arrival, condemned prisoner Rafiq, Hashem and 2/3 other unknown persons made good their escape, while one Shahid Mia was arrested, who made a confessional statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the Magistrate, 1<sup>st</sup> Class, Chandpur. Appellant Md. Idris Mia was subsequently apprehended by the police.<br/> <br/>The learned Judge of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Bishesh Adalat No. 1, Chandpur framed charge against four accused persons, namely, Md. Shahid Mia, Md. Rafique, Most. Shahida Khatun and Md. Idris Mia under sections 8/12 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain, 1995 (briefly the Ain, 1995) in presence of Md. Shahid Mia and Md. Idris Mia, since the other two accused persons remained in abscondence. The charge was read over to the accused persons present in the dock to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. However, the absconding accused persons remained unrepresented, although on the following day, a State Defence lawyer was appointed to defend them.<br/> <br/>At the trial, the prosecution examined 15 witnesses in support of their case, while the defence examined none.  On conclusion of recording of evidence, the incriminating part of the evidence adduced by the prosecution at the trial and the confessional statement of accused Shahid Mia was brought to the notice of the persons facing the trial to which they pleaded their innocence and claimed to be tried. Upon consideration of the material evidence on record, the learned Judge of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal No. 2, Chandpur acquitted  Md. Shahid, but sentenced both the condemned prisoners and the appellant Md. Idris Mia in the manner noted above.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Shamsul Haque, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing in support of the Reference has placed the FIR, the deposition of the witnesses and the impugned judgment. The learned Deputy Attorney General (briefly, the learned DAG) submits that the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence has been rightly passed and calls for no interference in view of the recovery of the victims from the custody of the condemned prisoners.<br/> <br/>On the other hand, Mr. Md. Habibullah Chowdhury, the learned Advocate appearing as State Defence lawyer for both the absconding condemned prisoners, has challenged the impugned judgment on two grounds ; technical and substantive. As to the technical ground, the learned Advocate submits that although the charge was framed on 17.08.99 by the learned Judge of the Special Tribunal, on that date, the condemned prisoners remained unrepresented in Court. On the following day after framing of charge, a State Defence lawyer was appointed for the condemned prisoners and in such view of the matter, the framing of the charge, vis-a-vis the condemned prisoners, was improper and invalid in the eye of law. On the substantive ground, the learned Advocate submits that although the conviction of the accused persons was secured under sections 8 and 12 of the Ain, 1995, the basic elements or requirements of the aforesaid two sections are missing in the instant case and on such ground, the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence is liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/>In order to appreciate the submissions advanced at the Bar, we are called upon to review the evidence on record.<br/> <br/>PW 1, the informant, is the former husband of the victim Marzina (PW 13). He narrated the incident as disclosed in the FIR and further stated that on reaching the village haat, he found condemned prisoner Rafique and another person in a restaurant and upon seeing him, they fled from there, but their accomplice Shahid Mia was apprehended by the public. Subsequently, the victims were recovered from the house of said Hamid Ali, but condemned prisoner Rafique, his wife Shahida Khatun and Md. Idris Mia managed to escape.<br/> <br/>In his cross-examination, he stated that two criminal cases were pending against him. He further stated that he was acquainted with Idris Mia who was present at the hotel along with Shahid, Rafique and some other persons. He denied that accused Shahid was implecated in this case due to previous enmity and also denied that the accused persons did not commit any offence.<br/> <br/>PW 2 Abdul Hakim, the village policeman, stated that he accompanied Rakhal Chowkider, Momtaj and others and recovered the victims from Paragaon village. In his cross-examination, he stated that he did not see any accused persons when the victims were rescued.<br/> <br/>PW 3 Abul Hossain is a journalist as well as a teacher of Nurpur Laboratory High School.

He further deposed that upon query from the aforesaid persons, he came to learn that Rafique and his associates were attempting to send them to Pakistan on the pretext of providing them with jobs there, but the victims were rescued from village Paragaon from the house of one Abdul Hamid, the father-in-law of condemned-prisoner Rafique.<br/> <br/>In his cross-examination, he stated that he did not go to Paragaon and that he did not see the victims being rescued, but found them near the bus-stand surrounded by the public.<br/> <br/>PW 4 Helal Uddin runs a medicine store in Rahimanagor Bazar. On 29.01.99 at about 5:30 p.m., he saw a crowd near the bus-stand and heard that some traffickers had been detained. He saw appellant Shahid, who was a baby-taxi driver, along with two other women.

He took the accused-persons as well as the victims to the Thana and handed them over to the police.<br/> <br/>In his cross-examination, he stated that he did not give any statement to the I/O. He identified Malek at the dock.<br/> <br/>PW 6 Momtaj Uddin is another village policeman in Ward No. 10. On the day in question, he heard that some traffickers had been detained at Hamid Ali’s house and Hakim Chowkider and the informant rescued Morzina, Nazma Akter, Kamal Hossain and others from the said house and they were  subsequently handed over to the police.<br/> <br/>In his cross-examination, he stated that he did not find the others except appellant Shahid present there.<br/> <br/>PW 7 Abul Kashem is a Member of the Rahimanagor Bazar Committee. He deposed that on 29.01.99 at about 6:30 p.m. upon hearing hue and cry near the bus-stand, he went there along with others and the informant (PW 1) informed them that his wife and child and two other women were being detained in the house of Abdul Hamid for the purpose of trafficking. Upon hearing this, PW 7 along with Rakhal Chowkider, Hakim Chowkider and Shajahan Member and others went to the said place and rescued the victims and handed them over to the Chowkider. The informant’s wife Marzina informed them that appellant Shahid Miah and some others brought them there on the assurance of providing well-paid jobs in Pakistan.<br/> <br/>In his cross-examination, he stated that he did not find any accused person at Rafique’s in-law’s house since they had already fled from the scene. He further stated that the informant disclosed the name of appellant Shahid Miah, but denied that the informant was known to him from before.<br/> <br/>PW 8 Md. Safiullah was tendered by the prosecution. In his cross-examination, he stated that he heard that appellant Idris was innocent.<br/> <br/>PW 9 Kong Kham Neel Moni Singh was working as the Magistrate, 1<sup>st</sup> Class, Chandpur. He recorded the statements of victim Nazma Akter and Morzina Begum and identified the same as Exhibit 2 and his signature thereon as Exhibits 2/1 and 2/2. He also recorded the statement of the informant.<br/> <br/>In his cross-examination, he denied that the victims made their respective statements at the dictation of the police.<br/> <br/>On being re-called, PW 9 deposed that he recorded the statement of victim Kamal under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and identified the same as Exhibit 7 and his signature thereon as Exhibit 7/2.<br/> <br/>In his cross-examination, he stated that he recorded the statements as stated by the victims themselves.<br/> <br/>PW 10 Miah Md. Shahid was the Officer-In-Charge of Kachua Thana at the relevant time and upon receiving the written ejhar from PW 1, he initiated the P.S. case. He stated that SI Abbas Ali was entrusted with the investigation of the case.<br/> <br/>PW 11 Md. Jahangir Alam, Magistrate, 1<sup>st</sup> Class, Sylhet Sadar recorded the confessional statement of Md. Shahid under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

He visited the place of occurrence, prepared sketch map with index and recorded the statement of the victims and appellant Shahid under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and filed charge sheet against the accused persons. He identified the accused persons present at the dock. In his cross-examination, he denied that he did not conduct the investigation properly and also denied that the accused persons were not involved with the alleged offence.<br/> <br/>PW 13 Morzina is one of the victim. She deposed that she was initially married to the informant, but their marriage ended in divorce and subsequently she married one Abdur Rashid. She stated that at the relevant time when she was still married to the informant, she left their rented house following a quarrel with him and went to her sister’s house at Chittagong. As she did not find her sister, she returned to Chandpur. As she did not find her husband at home, she went to the landlord’s house. He offered to send her abroad and introduced her to Idris and Raifque. Idris took her to his house and kept her there and both Rafiq and Idris brought some papers and asked her to put her LTI on those papers for the purpose of going abroad. However, after obtaining her LTI on the blank-papers, she was told that her divorce had taken place. Thereafter, Idris took her to another house along with her son from where they were brought to Paragon in a baby-taxi which was driven by appellant Shahid. She further stated that they were scheduled to be sent abroad on 29.01.99, but they were rescued on that date at about 5:00 in the evening by her husband (the informant) and although Idris and Shahid were apprehended, Rafique and his wife managed to escape. She further stated that the accused persons were planning to send her abroad along with her child in the name of providing a well-paid job.<br/> <br/>In her cross-examination, she stated that she married Abdur Rashid about two years back. She further stated that she was first taken by Idris to his house and from there to Rafique’s in-laws house at Rahimanagor, where she was kept for five days before being rescued by the informant.<br/> <br/>PW 14 Nazma Akter is also a victim. She stated that she used to reside in Comilla along with her parents and Rafique and his wife used to stay in the neighbouring house. Rafique’s wife Shahida proposed to send her abroad (Pakistan) in exchange of Tk. 2,000/- and some ornaments. Accordingly, she paid Tk. 2,000/- and also gave a pair of ear-rings to Rafique and his wife and she was brought to Rahimanagor from where she was subsequently rescued. She further stated that during her confinement, she became scared and requested Shahida to refund the money, but Shahida refused to do so. She further stated that Rafique and his wife Shahida were engaged in the business of trafficking women.<br/> <br/>In her cross-examination, she stated that she did not know any one else other than Rafique and his wife, whom she knew for about 10/12 years. She categorically stated that it was Raifque’s wife who had enticed her to leave home.<br/> <br/>PW 15 Md. Kamal Hossain, another victim, stated that condemned-prisoner Rafique convinced his (victim’s) father to send him to Pakistan for Tk. 7,000/-. On 25.01.99, Rafique brought him to Shahidpur village in Baghmara from where he was taken to Rahimanagor to Rafique’s in-law’s house where he saw Nazma and her child. He further stated that if he was not rescued by the informant on that day, he would have been sent to Pakistan.<br/> <br/>During cross-examination, he stated that Rafique took him to his in-law’s house. He denied that Rafiq and his wife were innocent.<br/> <br/>We may now refer to the confessional statement of accused Md. Shahid (since acquitted) made before the Magistrate, 1<sup>st</sup> Class, Chandpur, which reads as under :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“আমার নাম মোঃ শহীদ, পিতা- আনু মিয়া। আমি লাকসাম থানার বেতিয়া পাড়া গ্রামে বাস করি। আমি একজন বেবী ট্যাক্সি ড্রাইভার। গত শুক্রবার ভোর ৬ টায় আমি বেবি নিয়া আমার বাড়ী থেকে বের হই। তখন থেকে জুমার নামাজের আজান দেয়ার সময় পর্যন্ত লাকসাম- বাগমারা এলাকায় গাড়ী চালাই। আমি গাড়ীটি বাগমারা জামে মসজিদের সামনে গাড়ী রাখিয়া জুমআর নামজ পড়িতে যাই। আমি নামাজ পড়িয়া গাড়ীর কাছে যাইয়া দেখি রফিক, মাইনুল আর ইদ্রিস এই ৩ জনে একটি আনুঃ ৫ বছরের বাচ্চাসহ একজন মহিলাকে সাথে করে দাড়াইয়া আছে। আমি নামাজ পড়ে গাড়ীর কাছে গেলে রফিক আমাকে জিজ্ঞাসা করে, “তুমি রহিমা নগর যাইতে পারবানি”? ২ ঘন্টার মধ্যে পৌছাইয়া দিতে পারলে ২ হাজার টাকা দেব।” অামার সাথে রফিক, মাইনুল ও ইদ্রিসের পূর্ব থেকে পরিচয় ছিল। ওদের কথায় রাজি হই। ওরা যে বিদেশে লোক পাঠায় তা আমি জানতাম। ওরা বিদেশে মানুষকে চাকুরী দেয় তা জানতাম। এর মধ্যে তারা অন্যায় করতো- এইটা জানতাম না। ওরা নিজেদের মধ্যে আলাপ করে বেবীতে উঠে। মাইনুল পিছনে হোন্ডায় আসে। তাদের কথায় আমি যা বুঝতে পারলাম তা হইল রহিমানগরে ও তাদের আরো কয়েকজন লোক আছে। এদের সাথে তাদেরকেও তারা বিদেশে পাঠাইয়া দিবে। আমি- আনুমানিক বেলা ৪ টায় রহিমানগরে তাদেরকে নিয়া পৌছাই। আমি রহিমানগর বাজারের উত্তর দিকে মেইন রোডের উপর দাড়াইয়া আছি। তারা গাড়ী থেকে নামিয়াছে। আমি তাদেরকে বললাম, “ভাড়া দেন।” রফিক বললো, “তুমি বাজারে বসে চা খাও- আমি আসতেছি এখনই। এই বলিয়া সে চলিয়া গেল। তখন আমি রহিমানগর বাজারে আসি। আনুমানিক আধা ঘন্টা পর রফিক ও মাইনুল বাজারে ফিরে আসে। এর কিছুক্ষণ আগে একজন (ছেড়া) (এখন আমি জানি তার নাম মোস্তফা কামাল এবং সে (মহিলা) যাকে আমি বেবিতে লাকসাম থেকে আনি তার স্বামী) আমাকে জিজ্ঞাসা করে, “তুমি কোথা থেকে আসিয়াছ? আমি বললাম, লাকসামের বাগমারা থেকে আসিয়াছি সে বলে “তোমার গাড়ীতে একজন বাচ্চা ছেলেসহ কোন মহিলা আসিয়াছে কিনা? ” আমি বললাম “আমার গাড়ীতে বাচ্চাসহ একজন মহিলা একজন পুরুষের সাথে আসিয়াছে।” তখন ঐ মানুষটি আমাকে গ্রাম পুলিশ দিয়া ধরায়। আমি তাদেরকে বললাম “আমি প্যাছেঞ্জার নিয়া আসিয়াছে। আমার কি দোষ? এরপর তারা আমাকে থানায় পাঠাইয়া দিয়াছে। আমি কান্নাকাটি করি কিন্তু রহিমানগরের আমাকে চিনে না। আর ঐ মহিলার স্বামী মোস্তফা আমাকে নারী পাচারের লোক বলায় বাজারের লোকেরাও আমার পক্ষে কথা বলে না। আসামীরা অন্যায় কাজ করিতেছে” এই কথা জানতে পারলে আমি তাদেরকে গাড়ীতে উঠাইতাম না। আসামী মইনুল ও রফিক হাই-ফাই চলে। আমার ধারনা ছিল তারা বিদেশে মানুষ পাঠাইয়া এত টাকা পায়। তারা মানুষের উপকার করে- এই টাই জানতাম। তবে ঐদিন এই ঘটনার পরথেকে আমি জানতে পারলাম যে তারা নারী পাচার করে। তাদের কঠোর শাস্তি হওয়া দরকার। আমার একটি বাচ্চাসহ আমার পরিবার অত্যন্ত কষ্টে সময় কাটাইতেছে। এই আমার বক্তব্য।"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The learned Judge of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal No. 2, Chandpur acquitted  Md. Shahid, but sentenced both the condemned prisoners and the appellant Md. Idris Mia in the manner noted above.<br/> <br/> <br/>For proper understanding and appreciation of the relevant law, we may now refer to section 8 and section 12 of the Ain, 1995.<br/>Section 8 reads as under :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“৮। নারী পাচার ইত্যাদির শাস্তি- (১) কোন ব্যক্তি যদি বেশ্যাবৃত্তি বা অবৈধ সহবাস বা বে-আইনী ও নীতিবিগর্হিত কাজে নিয়োজিত করার উদ্দেশ্যে কোন নারী আমদানী, রপ্তানী, ক্রয় বা বিক্রয় করেন বা ভাড়ায় বা অন্য কোনভাবে হস্তান্তর করেন, তাহা হইলে উক্ত ব্যক্তি যাবজ্জীবন কারাদন্ডে দন্ডনীয় হইবেন এবং ইহার অতিরিক্ত অর্থদন্ডে দন্ডনীয় হইতে পারেন।<br/>(২) কোন ব্যক্তি যদি বেশ্যাবৃত্তি বা অবৈধ সহবাস বা বে-আইনী ও নীতিবিগর্হিত কাজে নিয়োজিত করার উদ্দেশ্যে কোন নারী আমদানী বা রপ্তানী ভাড়ায় বা অন্য কোনভাবে হস্তান্তর করার জন্য কোন নারীকে তাহার দখলে, জিম্মায় বা হেফাজতে রাখেন, তাহা হইলে উক্ত ব্যক্তি ১৪ বৎসরের সশ্রম কারাদন্ডে দন্ডনীয় হইবেন, এবং ইহার অতিরিক্ত অর্থদন্ডেও দন্ডনীয় হইতে পারেন।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Section 12 of the Ain, 1995 states as follows :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“যদি কোন ব্যক্তি বে-আইনীভাবে শিশু আমদানী, রপ্তানী বা বিক্রয় করেন, বা যদি আমদানী, রপ্তানী বা বিক্রয়ের উদ্দেশ্যে কোন শিশুকে কোন ব্যক্তি নিজ হেফাজতে রাখেন বা উক্ত উদ্দেশ্যে কোন শিশুকে কোন ব্যক্তির নিকট পাওয়া যায়, তাহা হইলে উক্ত ব্যক্তি মৃত্যুদন্ডে অথবা যাবজ্জীবন কারাদন্ডে দন্ডনীয় হইবেন।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From a plain reading of the aforesaid two sections, it appears that section 8 (1) relates to “আমাদানী, রপ্তানী, এ্রয় বা বিএ্রয়” or the transfer by way of hire or otherwise of any woman for the purpose of prostitution or unlawful intercourse or engaging her in illegal and immoral activities. Section 8 (2) contemplates the situation where any woman is kept under the control or custody of any person for any of the above mentioned purposes.<br/> <br/>It is apparent that section 8 relates only to women and not children. However, when the offence involves children, section 12 will come into play in determining the quantum of punishment.<br/> <br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General has referred to a decision, reported in 59 DLR 314, where a Division Bench of this Court had an occasion to decide a criminal appeal involving sections 8 and 12 of the Ain, 1995. However, this aspect was not addressed by the Court in that decision. The learned Deputy Attorney General submits that despite his best efforts, he could not lay his hands on any other decision in respect of sections 8 and 12 of the Ain, 1995.<br/> <br/>The ingredients or elements necessary for invoking sections 8 and 12 are missing in the instant case. There is no evidence on record to show that the victims were transferred to the custody of some other persons nor any documents like Passport, airline ticket etc were recovered to show that there was any intention to send the victims to Pakistan, as alleged by the victims themselves. The  statement of the victims, made under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, reveal that they were not abducted by the accused persons; rather, they went away on their own volition.<br/> <br/>As per the statement of the victims, they paid some money and gave ornaments to the accused persons for sending them abroad, who subsequently refused to return back the same, but assured the victims of providing them with jobs. But there is no evidence whatsoever to indicate that they were “bought” or “sold” or “exported” or “imported” or “transferred” for any  such illegal or immoral act, as contemplated in section 8 of the Ain, 1995. We fail to understand how, in the face of such statement from the victims themselves, the learned Judge of the Tribunal could find the accused persons guilty under sections 8 and 12 of the Ain, 1995 when, apparently, the preconditions for application of the aforesaid two sections were not fulfilled in the instant case. In the absence of such evidence, the order of conviction and sentence appears to be without any legal basis.<br/> <br/>It is to be noted that there is a substantive or fundamental difference between section 8 and section 12 with regard to imposition of punishment. While section 8 provides for a maximum punishment of imprisonment for life, section 12 stands for capital punishment.<br/> <br/>We have noticed, albeit with some astonishment, that the learned Judge, on a clear misconception of law and gross misreading of evidence, awarded capital punishment to the condemned prisoners finding them guilty under section 8, although the prescribed maximum punishment under that section is imprisonment for life. Furthermore, as noted earlier, section 8 deals with women (নারী), while section 12 deals with children (শিশু). It appears that the learned Judge, being totally oblivious of the definition of  “নারী” and “শিশু” as provided in section 2(ঘ) and 2(ছ) of the Ain, 1995, proceeded to try the case without splitting up the respective charges involving woman and children and passed the impugned order of conviction and sentence of death under section 8 and section 12, when section 8 has no such provision. This, in our view, is enough to make the conviction of the condemned prisoners unsustainable.<br/> <br/>The operative word used in section 8 of the Ain, 1995 is    “হস্তান্তর”. While section 8 (1) deals with actual “হস্তান্তর” or “transfer”, section 8(2) contemplates the situation where the victim is kept in the control or custody of the accused person for the purpose of “হস্তান্তর” or “transfer”. But nowhere within the four corners of the FIR or the statements of the victims do we find any evidence that there was any “হস্তান্তর” or “transfer” of the victims. All the victims were in the company of condemned prisoner   Rafique and his wife Shaheda and appellant Idris from the moment they left their respective homes till their recovery from Rafique’s in-laws house. They were not handed over to any third person and therefore, there was no “হস্তান্তর” or “transfer”, for the purpose of export or import or sale or purchase, as contemplated in section 8 and consequently, there is hardly any scope for application of the aforesaid section in the instant case.<br/> <br/>Similarly, section 12 of the Ain, 1995 deals with the situation where there is, in the words of the section “illegal import, export or sale of a child” or keeping in custody of a child by a person for the purpose of “import, export or sale”. Once again, we do not find any evidence on record to indicate that there was any “export, import or sale” of the victims.<br/> <br/>When the essential ingredients required for invoking sections 8 and 12 are wanting in the instant case, the order of conviction and sentence based on the aforesaid two sections would obviously become unsustainable.<br/> <br/>We now turn to the other, yet, more significant aspect of the case. The terms “রপ্তানী”, “আমদানী”, employed in sections 8 and 12 of the Ain, 1995 appears to us, prima-facie, to be misconstrued. The words “export” and “import” generally relate to commercial transaction of commodities or goods which is either sent to another country or brought in from another country, primarily for the purpose of trade and commerce and they signify a very important aspect of trade and commerce in today’s commercial world.  Both the process of export and import usually involves several Government agencies and departments, not to mention commercial Banks.<br/> <br/>It is, perhaps, pertinent at this stage to refer to the meaning of some of the relevant terms central to the issue before us.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">The Chambers Dictionary defines the terms export and import as under :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“export – the act of exporting ; something which is exported ; a commodity which is or may be sent from one country to another as a business transaction”.<br/>“import – to bring in from an outside source ; to bring in from abroad”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In Black’s Law Dictionary (Sixth Edition), the terms export and import have been defined as under :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“Export, n. Products manufactured in one country, and then shipped and sold in another. A thing or commodity exported. More commonly used in the plural.”<br/>“Import. A product manufactured in a foreign country, and then shipped to and sold in this country.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The Law Lexicon provides the following definition :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“EXPORT.  …………………..<br/>to send out from one country to another ; to send goods and merchandise from one country to another ; to send or carry out of the state, for the purpose of sale, trade, or disposition.<br/>‘Import means bringing or entry of any goods into the Octrori limits of Board from any place outside such limits.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>According to The Concise Oxford Dictionary, the term “commodity” means :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Commodity, n. Useful thing ; article of trade (staple c.); of trade.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In Chambers 21<sup>st</sup> Century Dictionary, the terms “goods” and “commodity” have been defined as follows :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Commodity. Noun (commodities) something that is bought and sold, especially a manufactured product raw material.<br/>Goods. Plural noun 1 articles for sale; merchandise”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From the definitions quoted above, it is evident that the terms ‘goods’ and ‘commodities’ do not, by any strech of imagination, include “human beings”, more particularly “woman” and/or “child”.<br/> <br/>We find, much to our surprise and dismay, that section 8 contemplates the “আমদানী বা রপ্তানী” of নারী, while section 12  contemplates “বে-আইনীভাবে শিশু আমদানী, রপ্তানী…….”. The process of export and import generally involves goods or commodities. However, the export or import of “নারী” and “শিশু”, as contemplated in the aforesaid two sections, is not only unheard of, but novel too in the field of legislation, which is neither desirable, nor acceptable. We are not aware of any civil society in today’s world that allows or provides for, and that too by legislation, the export or import of “woman” and “child”.  The very terms “আমদানী” and “রপ্তানী” are legal terms and the prefix of the word “বে-আইনীভাবে” before the terms “আমদানী” or “রপ্তানী” cannot render the aforesaid two terms “illegal”.<br/> <br/>Mr. Hassan Foiz Siddique, the learned Additional Attorney General appeared at our instance to address us on these issues. Having gone through the provisions of both sections 8 and 12 of the Ain, 1995, he frankly conceded that the terms “আমদানী” and “রপ্তানী” are quiet inappropriate in the context of the spirit and intent in which the law was promulgated by the Legislators. The learned  Additional Attorney General submits that the primary objective of the Ain, 1995 was to prevent the trafficking (পাচার) of women and children which was assuming an alarming proportion during the relevant period. However, the learned Additional Attorney General concedes that the words used in the section are neither appropriate nor satisfactory.<br/> <br/>In our view, the tenor and sprit of the legislation is quiet clear, as has been rightly canvassed by the learned Additional Attorney General. However, the choice of words used in sections 8 and 12 of the Ain, 1995 is far from satisfactory ; rather, they are inappropriate and out of context, to say the least.<br/> <br/>We are constrained to observe with regard to the Ain, 1995 that the concerned officials, who were entrusted with the task of drafting this particular law, have not only demonstrated an utter lack of common sense, but were also callous and inept, to say the least.<br/> <br/>The observation made by us hereinabove is intended for the information and guidance of all concerned, particularly the officials of the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs who are entrusted with the task of drafting laws and ordinance so as to ensure that repetitions of such nature do not occur in future.<br/> <br/>The logical inference from the above discourse is that the impugned order of conviction and sentence of death of the absconding condemned-prisoners is not sustainable in law and consequently, the instant Death Reference is liable to be rejected.<br/> <br/>This bring us now to Criminal Appeal No. 3520 of 2004, which is at the instance of Md. Idris Mia. Although one Farida Yeasmin, a learned Advocate of this Court, filed  power, she did not turn up when the matter was taken up for hearing. Be that as it may, we propose to dispose of the criminal appeal on merit.<br/> <br/>It appears that the learned Judge of the Court below found the complicity of appellant Idris Mia in the alleged offence for taking victim Marzina from her house to another house in the village and from there to condemned prisoner’s Rafique’s father-in-law’s house. However, the aforesaid evidence is not enough to bring the offence within the ambit and scope of sections 8 and 12 of the Ain, 1995. Even if the statements made by the victims are taken to be true and correct in their entirety, the only role played by appellant Idris Mia was that of taking the victims from one place to another. In the absence of any evidence to show that the fundamental requirements of section 8 and section 12 were fulfilled, the conviction and sentence of Md. Idris Mia under the aforesaid two sections is not sustainable. In such view of the matter, there is considerable merit in the appeal.<br/> <br/>Having regard to the foregoing discussion, we are of the view that the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed by the learned Judge, Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal No. 2, Chandpur in Nari-O-Shishu Case No. 26 of 1999 under sections 8 and 12 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain, 1995 warrants interference from this Court.<br/> <br/>Resultantly, Criminal Appeal No. 3520 of 2004 is allowed. The order of conviction and sentence of imprisonment for life passed in respect of Md. Idris Mia is hereby set aside.<br/> <br/>Let Md. Idris Mia, son of late Joynal Abedin, be set at liberty if not wanted in connection with any other case.<br/> <br/>Death Reference No. 128 of 2004 stands rejected. The orders of conviction and sentence of death passed in respect of Md. Rafique (absconding), son of Korban Ali and Most. Shahida Khatun (absconding), wife of Md. Rafique is hereby set aside.<br/> <br/>The warrant of arrest of Md. Rafique and Most. Shahida Khatun be recalled at once.<br/> <br/>Let a copy of this judgment be sent to the Secretary, Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs for information and guidance.<br/> <br/>        Let a copy of the judgment along with the lower Court’s records be sent down for information and necessary action.<br/> <br/><strong>        Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Ziaul Karim, J:</u></strong><br/> <br/>          This reference under Section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (briefly as the Code) has been made by learned Judge of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal no.2, Bogra (briefly as Tribunal), for confirmation of death sentences of condemned-prisoners.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong>         By the above appeals the appellants have challenged the legality and propriety of the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 18-05-2006 passed by learned Judge of Tribunal in Nari-O-Shishu Case no. 288 of 2004 convicting the appellants under Section 9(3) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 (briefly as Ain 2000) and sentencing each of them to death by hanging and also to pay a fine of Tk.1,00,000/= each.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>         This death reference and all these appeals having arisen out of a common judgment, these have been heard together and are being disposed of by this judgment.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>         The prosecution case put in a nutshell are that on the night following 13-08-2000 victim Shahnaj Akhter Banu alias Sumi (since deceased) daughter of Abdus Sattar (P.W.1) was in asleep in her father’s dwelling hut. At about 11:00 p.m. the accused called her out of the house on a pretext to get meet with her paramour Alam. Later on she was raped to death at the বনপাতির land belonged to father of Abdul Mannan. Later, dumped her body in a pond near the house. Subsequently the body was found floating in the pond and it was brought to its courtyard. The body bore multiple injuries having marks of sexual violence. On 14-08-2000 the incident was informed to her father who was then Station master at Adomdighi gate no.4, over telephone by Md. Belayet Hossain alias Nantu (P.W. 6). He, then rushed to his home and heard the occurrence from his wife Rowshan Ara Begum(P.W.2) to the effect that since 11:00 p.m. victim Sumi was found missing, son Sumon, domestic worker Md. Ashraful (P.W.7), neighbours Rafiqul, and Delbor (P.W.4)  unsuccessfully searched her and on the following morning her dead body was found inside the pond by Rafiqul. The accused also took her ornaments. The prosecution was launched by lodging a first information report (briefly as FIR) by Abdus Sattar (P.W.1) as informant which was recorded as Adamdighi Police Station case no. 9 dated 14-08-2000 corresponding to G.R. no. 90 of 2000.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>         During investigation on 02-09-2000 accused Md. Milon was arrested by the Police and on the same day he made confession before the learned Magistrate(Exhbt.4) implicating himself along with five co-accused namely Rabiul alias Hubul, Helal, Aslam, Musaddek and Mannan. Rabiul alias Hubul being arrested on 08-09-2000 made extra judicial confession before the locals implicating himself along with aforesaid persons.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>         The Police after investigation submitted charge sheet accusing the appellants under section 9(3) of the Ain 2000.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>         Eventually the accused were called upon to answer the charge under Section 9(3) of the Ain 2000 to which the accused on dock pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>         In course of trial the prosecution in all examined thirteen witnesses out of twenty charge sheeted witnesses. The defence examined none.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>         After closure of prosecution case, the accused were examined under Section 342 of the Code, again they repeated their innocence and led no evidence in defence.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>       The defence case as it appears from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses are that of innocence and false implication. It was divulged in defence that some unknown assailants kidnapped the victim. Subsequently raped her to death and due to internal feud between the accused and the informant, they were falsely implicated in this case.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>       After trial the accused were convicted as aforesaid.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>       The learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the State supports the reference and submits that soon after the occurrence arrestee Md. Milon made confession. Later on another co-accused Rabiul was nabbed by his father and locals who then made extra judicial confession. He adds that both the accused implicated themselves aswellas other co-accused. He adds that confession of Milon was true and voluntary, and there are corroborative evidence against all the accused. So the Court below rightly convicted them. He adds that the confession if it is found true and voluntary, may form the sole basis of conviction. In support of his contentions he refers the case of <em><strong>Abdur Rouf Mollah Vs. The State 2 LG (2005) AD 105</strong></em> held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>It is now well settled that the confessional statement if it is found to be true and voluntary may form the sole basis of conviction as against the maker even if it is subsequently retracted. In this case the confessional statement was not retracted immediately after making the same. It is only at the time of examination of the condemned prisoner under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, he at a belated stage retracted the same and such belated retraction has not made the confessional statement, which is voluntary and true, unworthy of making basis for conviction.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>13.</strong>       In the case of <em><strong>Samim Vs. The State 27 BLD (AD) 74</strong></em> held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>The appellant went to the place of occurrence and on the request of other accused he asked the night guard of the school to go out and then other accused came and killed the deceased but he did not disclose the same to anybody. Thus it appears that his confessional statement is not wholly exculpatory rather the same is partly exculpatory and partly inculpatory. It is true that he did not directly participate in the murder of the deceased but he participated in the occurrence by asking the night guard of the school to go out and thereby facilitating the murder of the deceased by other accused as narrated by him in his confessional statement. It is on record that the appellant retracted his confession in writing subsequently which clearly goes to show that he made the judicial confession. In the opinion of recording Magistrate the confession is true and voluntary. The confessional statement of the appellant is sufficient for his conviction and in addition there is circumstantial evidence also and the High Court Division rightly maintained his conviction and sentence and dismissed the appeal. The High Court Division upon correct assessment of the materials on record arrived at a correct decision and as such there is no cogent reason to interfere with the judgment of the said Division.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>14.</strong>       The learned Counsel next refers the case of <em><strong>A.B.M. Nazmus Sakib Ashik Vs. State 12 BLC (AD) 203</strong></em> held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“ It appears that the confessional statement can never be treated to be false or not voluntary but the same is statement of fact depicting vividly the occurrence and does not suffer any infirmity so as to render the same illegal due to certain allegation alleged in violation of any provision of law regarding the recording of the same. Moreover, at no point of time during trial the alleged allegation was raised against the confessional statement and the said allegation is an afterthought. The High Court Division has observed that  “ On careful scrutiny of the confessional statement of the accused ABM Nazmus Sakib alias Ashik, it appears that the Magistrate put to him six questions including the question that he was not bound to admit his guilt and make confessional statement and if he confessed, it would be used as evidence against him. He also gave him more than three hours’ time for reflection of mind and deciding about giving confession independently keeping him in seclusion as provided under law and thereafter started recording confession at about 6-15 PM. The Magistrate appears to have recorded his satisfaction as to the voluntariness and spontaneous nature of the confession of the accused.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>It appears that the confession has not been vitiated by any illegality on the alleged ground. Through the police apprehended the accused on 18-09-2000 but he was produced before the Magistrate for recording confession on 19-09-2000 at 12-15 hours and there is nothing on record that he was allegedly produced after more than 30 hours of the apprehension before the Magistrate for recording his confession. The alleged ground is as a measure of afterthought and assumed as not tenable in law.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>15.</strong>       He lastly submits that the case was proved by evidence and based on materials/evidence on record which calls for no interference by this Court.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>       The learned Counsels appearing for the condemned-prisoners and appellants by their common contention seek to impeach the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence on the five fold arguments.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>       <strong><u>Firstly,</u></strong> the confession of Md. Milon  was not true and voluntary inasmuch as it was extracted on the point of fear, torture and coercion.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>       <strong><u>Secondly,</u></strong> the accused and the victim are inter-related so it was impossible for them to commit such offence.<br/> <br/><strong>19.       <u>Thirdly,</u></strong> the Court below convicted the co-accused on the basis of confession of Md. Milon without any substantive corroboration.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>       <strong><u>Fourthly,</u></strong> the Tribunal most erroneously considered the absconsion of accused Mannan, Musaddek and Aslam an incriminating matter which is not a correct view.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>       In support of their contention they refer the case of State Vs. Lalu Miah and another 39 DLR (AD)118 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>Absconsion by itself is not an incriminating matter, for, even an innocent person, if implicated in the ejahar for a serious crime, sometimes absconds to avoid harassment during investigation by the police. But in some cases a person with guilty knowledge also absconds. It is the facts and circumstances of the case which decide whether the absconsion is due to any guilty knowledge or to any intention to avoid police harassment.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong>22.</strong>       <strong><u>Fifthly,</u></strong> the Tribunal without appreciating the evidence on record convicted the accused on suspicion which cannot be sustained in the eye of law.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>       In support of their contention the learned Counsels refer the case of <em><strong>Abu Taher Chowdhury and others Vs. The State 11 BLD (AD)-2</strong></em> held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong>“<em> <u>Suspicion</u></em></strong><br/><em>Suspicion, however, strong it might be, is not a substitute for evidence on which to base a conviction. </em><em>In a gruesome murder when the accused cannot be brought to book for lack of evidence beyond reasonable doubt the prosecution, instead of bewailing on an order of acquittal, should take heed to improve its quality of investigation.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>24.</strong>       The learned Counsel lastly submits that the conviction of non-confessing accused based on the confession of accused Md. Milon without any substantive corroboration which cannot be sustained.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong>       In support of their contention they refer the case of <em><strong>Lutfun Naher Begum Vs. The State 27 DLR (AD)-29</strong></em> held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em> Confession of an accused cannot be treated as substantive evidence against another accused but that it can only be used "to lend assurance to other evidence." </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>26.</strong>       In order to appreciate their submissions we have gone through the record and given our anxious consideration to their submissions.<br/> <br/><strong>27.</strong>       Let us now weigh and sift the evidence on record as adduced by the prosecution to prove the charge.<br/><br/>P.W.1, Md.

The material excerpt of confession of Milon( Exhbt. 4) reads as hereunder:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“আমি আপনার জিজ্ঞাসাবাদে জানাচ্ছি যে, গত ১৩-০৮-২০০০ তারিখে দিবাগত রাতে রবিউল পিতা হাবু, হেলাল পিতা আলেফ, আসলাম পিতা নজরুল ওরফে নজু, মুসাদ্দেক পিতা মনসের, মান্নান পিতা সামাদ এবং আমি রাত অনুমান ১১ টার দিকে আমাদের প্রাননাথপুর গ্রামের সাত্তারের বাড়ির খোলানে যাই। হেলাল ও রবিউল সাত্তারের মেয়ে শাহনাজ যে ঘরে থাকে সেই ঘরের জানালায় হাত দিয়ে টোকা মারে এবং শাহনাজকে বলে তার প্রেমিক আলম এসেছে। শাহনাজ তার ঘর থেকে বের হয় এবং মই দিয়ে বাড়ির প্রাচীরের উপরে উঠে এবং আসলাম শাহনাজকে হাত দিয়ে ধরে প্রাচীরের বাইরে নামায়। আমাদের সঙ্গে অল্প কিছু দূরে অনুমান ২০/২৫ হাত যাওয়ার পরে শাহনাজ আলমের কথা জিজ্ঞেস করে। আলম পুকুর পাড়ে বলে হেলাল জানায়। আসলাম কাপড়  দিয়ে শাহনাজের মুখ চেপে ধরে এবং হেলাল শাহনাজকে পাঁজাকোলা করে শাহনাজ ওরফে সুমির পিতার বাড়ির পূর্ব দিকে অবস্থিত মান্নানের পিতার বনপাতির জমিতে নিয়ে যায়। আমি নিকটবর্তী  পুকুরের পারে বসে পাহাড়ায় ছিলাম যাতে অন্য লোকজন টের না পায়। প্রথমে হেলাল, তার পর আসলাম, তারপর মুসাদ্দেক, তারপর রবিউল, তারপর মান্নান এবং সর্বশেষে আমি শাহনাজ ওরফে সুমিকে  ধর্ষণ করি।  ধর্ষনের সময় শাহনাজ বাধা দেয়। শাহনাজের হাত পা জোর করে ধরে রেখে এবং  মুখে কাপড় চেপে ধরে ধর্ষণ করা হয়। ধর্ষনের পরে আসলাম ও হেলাল শাহনাজের ওড়না  দিয়ে ওখানেই শাহনাজের গলায় ফাঁস লাগায় গলায় পেঁচিয়ে মারার সময় মান্নান শাহনাজের  পা  ও রবিউল হাত ধরে ছিল।  মুসাদ্দেক আমাকে এই  ঘটনা  প্রকাশ করতে নিষেধ করে। হেলাল আমাকে বলে যে এই ঘটনা ফাস করলে  তোকে মারব। হেলাল, আসলাম ও রবিউল এই তিন জন শাহনাজের লাশ পুকুরের পূর্ব পাড়ে নিয়ে আসে হাত দিয়ে তুলে ধরে। শাহনাজের লাশ তারা পুকুরের  পূর্ব পাড়ে রাখে পানিতে, মাথাটির কিছু অংশ পানির উপরে পুকুরের পাড়ে মাটিতে ছিল। আমরা সবাই চলে গেলাম। আমি বাড়িতে গেলাম। পরদিন বিকেলে আমি বিরামপুরে যাই।<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>59.</strong>       We find that the occurrence took place on 13-08-2000 and accused Milon was arrested on 02-09-2000 and on the same day his confession was recorded.<br/> <br/><strong>60.</strong>       P.W.11 Md. Al Amin, Magistrate, first Class, recorded the confession of accused Milon (Exhbt. 4) after complying all legal formalities as laid down in Section 364 of the Code. He was cross-examined by the defence but nothing could be elucidated to shake its credibility in any manner whatsoever.<br/> <br/><strong>61.</strong>       It is pertinent to point out that at the time of recording confession by P.W.11 accused Milon did not raise any objection regarding its truth and voluntariness but later on, at the time of examination under section 342 of the Code, he offered an explanation to the effect that the confession was extracted under coercion and torture. The relevant excerpt of the said statement reads as hereunder:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"> </div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;"><br/>“জেলা বগুড়ার নারী ও শিশু নির্যাতন দমন বিষয়ক আদালত নং -২<br/>মোকদ্দমা নং -২৮৮/০৪ (নারী ও শিশু)<br/>রাষ্ট --------------------------------- বাদী<br/>-বনাম-<br/>মোঃ মিলন --------------------------আসামী</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"> <br/>বিষয়ঃ ফৌজদারী কার্য্য বিধি  আইনের ৩৪২ ধারার পরীক্ষাকালে আসামী মিলনের বক্তব্য।<br/> <br/>দরখাস্তপক্ষে আসামীর বিনীত নিবেদন এই যে, আসামী একজন মাদুর ব্যবসায়ী। আমি গত ইংরেজী ০১-০৯-২০০০ তারিখে দিনাজপুর জেলার বিরামপুরে মাদুর বিক্রি করাকালে অত্র মামলার বাদী মোঃ আবদুল সাত্তার এবং তাহার ভাগিনা  স্বপন বিরামপুর রেল ষ্টেশন হইতে পূর্বশত্রুতার জের হিসাবে আসামীকে ভয়ভীতি  প্রলোভন দিয়া ধরিয়া লইয়া আসিয়া প্রথমে বাদীর ভাগিনা স্বপনের সান্তাহার বাজারে অবস্থিত ইলেকট্রিক এর দোকানে উঠাইয়া আমাকে অমানবিক নির্যাতন করে এবং বাদীর কন্যাকে এই আসামী হত্যা না করা সত্বেও হত্যা করিয়াছি মর্মে বলানোর চেষ্টা  করে এবং বলে যে, তুমি মিথ্যা করে হলেও সব কিছু স্বীকার কর তোমার কিছুই হবে না আমি তোমাকে বাঁচাবো। অাসামী বাদীর উক্তরুপ কথাবর্তা ও নির্যাতনে কোন কিছু স্বীকার না করিলে আসামীকে বাদী এবং তাহার ভাগিনা স্বপন আদমদিঘী থানায় লইয়া গিয়া থানা কর্তৃপক্ষের নিকট সোপর্দ্দ করে এবং থানা কর্তৃপক্ষকে অন্যায় ও বে-আইনীভাবে  প্রভাবিত করিয়া আসামীর  উপরে অমানবিক নির্যাতন চালাইতে থাকে। সারারাত  ধরে পুলিশ আসামীর মাথার উপর গামছা  দিয়া চোখ মুখ বাধিয়া পানি ঢালে, আসামীর গোপনাংগে মরিচ  ঢুকাইয়া  দেয় তাহার দু, পা দড়ি দিয়া বাধিয়া মাঝখানে  বাশ ঢুকাইয়া  ঘুড়াইতে থাকে,  দুই হাতের আঙ্গুল  জোড়া জোড়া করিয়া বাধিয়া  পেরেক মারে এবং তাহাকে ভয় দেখায় এবং বলে যে, সে যদি ঘটনা কথা স্বীকার না করে তাহা হইলে তাহাকে জীবনে শেষ করিয়া ফেলিবে। সে যদি ঘটনার সহিত জড়িত না ও থাকে  তথাপিও সে যদি  ঘটনার কথা স্বীকার করে তাহা হইলে তাহার কিছুই হবে না মর্মে প্রলোভন দিতে থাকে।  বাদী  এবং পুলিশ  এই ভাবে আসামীকে বলিতে থাকে। আসামীর উপরে অমানুসিক নির্যাতনের ফলে আসামী তাহার স্বাভাবিক জ্ঞান বুদ্ধি লোপ পায় এবং সে তাহার ভালমন্দ অনুধাবন করার ক্ষমতা হারাইয়া ফেলে এবং পুলিশের  নিকট এবং মাজিস্ট্রেট সাহেবর নিকট  সে কি বলিয়াছে  তাহা তাহার স্মরণ নাই। প্রকৃতপক্ষে এই আসামীর  স্বীকারোক্তি স্বেচছা প্রনোদিত ছিল না এবং এই ধরনের  কোন কথাই  সে কোথাও বলে না। সে অত্র হত্যাকান্ড  কিংবা ধর্ষণের সাথে জড়িত ছিল না। বাদীর কন্যাকে হত্যা করিয়াছে তাহা সে কিছুই জানে না। এই আসামী নিজেকে সম্পূর্ন র্রপে নির্দোষ দাবী করে উপরোক্ত  বক্তব্য প্রদান করিল।<br/>                                                সত্যপাঠ<br/>এই দরখাস্তের  যাবতীয় বিবরণ সত্য জানিয়া  আমার নিজ নাম  স্বাক্ষর করিলাম।<br/>            মিলন ”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>62.</strong>       We have gone through the above contents. It appears to us that he made out a new story of torture, which are inconsistent with that of the evidence on record and  attention to those facts were not drawn to the investigating officer(P.W.13) at the time of cross-examining him who earlier arrested him and produced before the Magistrate for recording confession. So the same should be left out of consideration.<br/> <br/><strong>63.</strong>       It further appears to us that above confessing accused implicated himself in commission of rape and murdering. The materials on record shows that his confession was shown as voluntary and inculpatory in nature. So it is well established that confessional statement if found inculpatory in nature and also true and voluntary it can be used against its maker and conviction can solely be based on it without any further corroborative evidence. <br/> <br/><strong>64.</strong>       In the instant case the confession made by accused Milon (Exhbt.4) was not only inculpatory in nature, but also true and voluntary and as such the Tribunal very rightly based solely on the confession and correctly convicted and sentenced the above accused by the impugned judgment and order, having duly found him guilty for the offence committed under Section 9(3) of the Ain 2000.<br/> <br/><strong>65.</strong>       In the case of Islam Uddin (Md.) alias Din Islam  Vs. The State 13 BLC(AD)81 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“It is now settle principle of law that <em> Judicial confession if it is found to be true and voluntary can form the sole basis of conviction as against the maker of the same. The High Court Division has rightly found the judicial confession of the condemned-prisoner true and voluntary and considering the same, the extra judicial confession and, circumstances of the case, found the condemned-prisoner guilty and accordingly imposed the sentence of death upon him. ”  </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>66.</strong>       Similar views were taken in the cases of Abdur Rashid and others Vs. The State 3 BLD 206, Amir Hossain Vs. The State 6 BLD(AD)193, Gouranga Chandra Paul Vs. The State 59 DLR 17, 29 DLR(SC)27, Shajahan Ali (Md.) alias Md. Shahjahan Vs. The State 59 DLR 396, Hazrat Ali  and others Vs. The State 44 DLR(AD) 51, The State Vs. Abul Kalam Azad and others 8 BLC 464. Therefore we hold that the Court below rightly convicted the condemned prisoner Md. Milon after considering the evidence on record.<br/> <br/><strong>67.</strong>       We should bear in mind, credibility of testimony oral and circumstantial, depends considerably on a judicial evaluation of the totality, not isolated scrutiny. When dealing with the serious question of guilt or innocence of persons charged with crime, the following principles should be taken into consideration.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>a) The onus of proving everything essential to the establishment of the charge against the accused lies on the prosecutor.<br/>b) The evidence must be such asto exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.<br/>c) In matters of doubt it is safer to acquit than to condemn, for it is better that several guilty persons should escape than that one innocent person suffer.<br/>d) There must be clear and unequivocal proof of the corpus delicit.<br/>e) The hypothesis of delinquency should be consistent with all the facts proved.<br/>Inspite of the presumption of truth attached to oral evidence under oath if the Court is not satisfied, the evidence inspite of oath is of no avail.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>68.</strong>       It further appears to us that accused Milon in his Judicial confession (Exhbt.4) disclosed the complicity of accused Rafibul alias Hubul along with other accused particularly in respect of direct participation of commission of rape and murder. Accused Rabiul alias Hubul was arrested on 08-09-2000 with the help of his father and locals. Later he confessed his guilt and complicity of above co-accused in commission of rape and murder of deceased Sumi in presence of PWs.1-8. His statements was also recorded in the cassette in their presence which was proved by P.W.6 as Mat. Exhbt. VI. The voice recorded in cassette was also proved by the above witnesses. The contents of Judicial confession of accused Milon (Exhbt.4) and statement of accused Rabiul alias Hubul recorded in cassette (Mat. Exhbt. VI) are identical in respect of complicity of all accused with regards to rape and murder of deceased Sumi. So the evidence of all these PWs. regarding the commission of offence by accused Rabiul alias Hubul are consistent uniform and corroborative with each other with all material particulars. There is absolutely no reason to disbelieve the consistent and corroborative evidence of those competent witnesses having no reason whatsoever to depose falsely against him. The defence extensively cross-examined them but nothing could be elicited to shake their credibility in any manner whatsoever. So the same are invulnerable to the credibility. Therefore, considering the evidence on record and substantive corroborative evidence, the Tribunal rightly convicted the accused Rabiul alias Hubul.<br/> <br/><strong>69.</strong>       It appears to us that there is absolutely no evidence against other four accused namely Helal, Aslam, Musaddek, and Mannan alias A. Mannan, save and except their names were disclosed by other two co-accused, viz Milon and Rabiul alias Hubul. We also find that there is no substantive corroboration with the Judicial and extra-Judicial confessions of co-accused Milon and Rabiul alias Hubul. So such confessions should not be used against them.<br/> <br/><strong>70.       </strong>It is well settled that the confession of an accused is not a substantive piece of evidence against co-accused who did not confess and such evidence alone without any substantive corroborative evidence cannot form basis of conviction of co-accused. With this regard reliance is being placed in this case of Mofazzal Hossain alias Mofa and others Vs. State 58 DLR-524. This view receives support in the cases of State Vs. Rafiqullah Khan 7 BLC-480, Ustar Ali Vs. State 3 BLC (AD)53, Lutfurnahar Vs. State 27 DLR(AD)29, Babor Ali Molla Vs. State 44 DLR(AD)10, State Vs. Lalu Mia 39 DLR(AD)117, Amir Hossain Vs. State 37 DLR(AD)179, Joygun Bibi Vs. The State 12 DLR(SC) 156.<br/> <br/><strong>71.</strong>       Therefore we hold that the Tribunal without considering the settled principle of law and the materials and evidence on record most erroneously convicted them which cannot be sustained.<br/> <br/><strong>72.</strong>       The explanation given under the section includes within the term “ offence” used in the section, the abetment or attempt to commit the offence. The language of the section does not render the confession of a co-accused as evidence within the definition of section 3 of the Evidence Act. It simply says that the Court may “take into consideration such confession”. In the case of Bhuboni Sahu Vs. The King, reported in L.R.76 Indian Appeals page 147, the Privy Council stated as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“But a confession of a co-accused is obviously evidence of a very weak type. It does not indeed come within the definition of “evidence” contained in section 3 of the Evidence Act. It is not required to be given on oath, nor in the presence of the accused, and it cannot be tested by cross-examination. Section 30, however, provides that the court may take the confession into consideration and thereby, no doubt, makes it evidence on which the court may act; but the section does not say that the confession is to amount to proof. Clearly there must be other evidence. The confession is only one element in the consideration of all the facts proved in the case; it can be put into the scale and weighed with the other evidence.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>73.</strong>       In view of the observation above, the questions arose in what way can a confession be used in support of other evidence and whether it can be used to fill in missing gaps. The questions were considered by the Supreme Court of India in the case of Kashmira Singh Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, reported in 1952 S.C.R.(India) 526. After referring approvingly to the observations made by Sir Lawrence Jenkins in the case of Emperor Vs. Lalit Mohan Chockerbutty, reported in (1911)I.L.R.38 Calcutta, 559 at 588 where it was said that such a confession can only be used to “ led assurance to other evidence against a co-accused” and to the observation of Reilly, J. in re Periyaswami Moopan reported in (1931) I.L.R. 54 Madras, 75 at 77 that “where there is evidence against the co-accused sufficient, if believed, to support his conviction, then the kind of confession described in section 30 may be thrown into the scale as an additional reason for believing that  evidence”, the Supreme Court of India held as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The proper way to approach a case of this kind is first, to marshal the evidence against the accused excluding the confession altogether from consideration and see whether, if it is believed a conviction could safely be based on it. If it is capable of belief independently of the confession, then of course it is not necessary to call the confession in aid. But cases may arise when the judge is not prepared to act on the other evidence as it stands even though, if believed, it would be sufficient to sustain a conviction. In such an event the Judge may call in aid the confession and use it to lend assurance to the other evidence and thus fortify himself in believing what without the aid of the confession he would not be prepared to accept.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>74.</strong>       We may as well refer to the views expressed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan is two cases. In the case of Joygun Bibi Vs. The State, reported in (1960) 12 DLR(SC)156 it was held that the High Court was not justified in discarding the confession of co-accused Abdul Majid, in connection with the question of the guilt of the appellant Joygun Bibi. It was found that confession of Abdul Majid was by no means the only material against Joygun Bibi but that there was other evidence which, along with the confession of Abdul Majid, pointed to her guilt.<br/> <br/><strong>75.</strong>       In the case of Maqbool Hussain Vs. The State, reported in (1960) 12 DLR (SC) 217 the Supreme Court of Pakistan made the following observations regarding the use of a confession under Section 30 of the Evidence Act-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The language of the section is very guarded and lends no warrant to the inference that such a statement made by a co-accused could be treated as substantive evidence against the other person sufficient to sustain his conviction. It is well settled that there ought to be other evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, linking such a person with the crime. Before a confession made by a co-accused could be adverted to, in adjudging the guilt of that person.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>76.</strong>       The upshot of the discussions above is that confession of an accused cannot be treated as substantive evidence against another accused but that it can only be used “ to lend assurance to other evidence.”<br/> <br/><strong>77.</strong>       In the instant case, there is no doubt that the above four appellants have been implicated in the murder in the confessional statement of two accused, but the said confessional statements cannot be taken into consideration unless there exists independent evidence, direct or circumstantial, to connect the appellants with the murder. There is no direct evidence in this case against them. So such confessions should not be used against them.<br/> <br/><strong>78.</strong>       In Indian Jurisdiction we find that while dealing with a case as regards the confession of co-accused affecting himself and some other persons who were being tried jointly with him for the same offence, their Lordships of the Supreme Court of India have laid down the law as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“ In dealing with a criminal case where the prosecution relies upon the confession of one accused person against another accused person, the proper approach to adopt is to consider the other evidence against such an accused person, and if the said evidence appears to be satisfactory and the Court is inclined to hold that the said evidence may sustain the charge framed against the said accused person, the Court turns to the confession with a view to assure itself that the conclusion which it is inclined to draw from the other evidence is right,   AIR 1964 SC 1184.</em><br/><br/>In a case it has been observed as follows:<br/><br/><em>“In dealing with a case against an accused person, the Court can not start with the confession of a co-accused person; it must begin with other evidence adduced by the prosecution and after it has formed its opinion with regard to the quality and effect of the said evidence, then  it is permissible to turn to the confession in order to receive assurance to the conclusion of guilt which the judicial mind is about to reach on the said other evidence. That, briefly stated, is the effect of the provisions contained in section 30, AIR 1949 PC 257+ AIR 1952 SC 159.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>79.</strong>       Under section 30, Evidence Act, confession of a co-accused can only be taken into consideration but is not in itself substantive evidence. AIR 1957 SC 381+AIR 1964 AP 548.<br/> <br/><strong>80.</strong>       Where such statement is exculpatory it cannot be used against another accused in support of his conviction. It would be dangerous to do so. AIR 1967. Goa 31 at p.25.<br/> <br/><strong>81.</strong>       It has been laid down that confessions of co-accused are not evidence as defined in section 3 and no conviction can be founded thereon. But, if there was other evidence on which a conviction be based, they can be referred to as lending assurance to that conclusion and for fortifying it. AIR 1956 SC 56.<br/> <br/><strong>82.</strong>       The law is well-settled that the confession of a co-accused is not substantive evidence in the sense that conviction on that alone must stand and section 30 has merely given the Court a discretion to call it in aid inappropriate case. It can be used only for lending assurance and is to be merely an  element in considering the evidence in the case. If there is no other evidence or if the other evidence in the case is insufficient to establish the case against the accused, the confession cannot betaken into consideration against the co-accused. It cannot be called in aid to supplement evidence otherwise insufficient and in no case can  it be used to fill up gaps in the prosecution evidence. AIR 1957 A.P. 758 + AIR 1952 SC 139+AIR 1956 SC 56+AIR 1957 Orissa 172.<br/> <br/><strong>83.</strong>       The confession of a co-accused person can be pressed into service only when the Court is inclined to accept other evidence and feels the necessity of seeking for an assurance in support of its conclusion deducible from the said evidence. AIR 1952 SC 159+air 1964 SC 1184+AIR1965 Orissa 170.<br/> <br/><strong>84.</strong>       A confession can only be used to “lend assurance to other evidence against a co-accused AIR 1966 Pat. 448.<br/> <br/><strong>85.</strong>       Their Lordships held that one of the conditions in section 30 of the Evidence Act is that the confession must implicate the maker substantially to the same extent as the other accused against whom it is sought to be taken into consideration. Where he was really trying to throw the main blame on the other accused and make out that he was an unwilling spectator to the crime committed by the other accused, the confession cannot be used at all against the other accused. But because there was differences between his confession and the confessional statement of the other accused, the confessional statement cannot be condemned in limini. AIR 1957 SC 216+(1966) 142 Cut LT 1140.<br/> <br/><strong>86.</strong>       The confessional statement made by one accused could only be taken into consideration against other co-accused if there is other acceptable evidence against the other co-accused for the purpose of lending further assurance which the Court may need. Hence in the absence of any other evidence in this case the confessional statement made by any one of the appellants cannot be used against the other appellants AIR 1964 SC 1184+1977 Crl.LJ 1309.<br/> <br/><strong>87.</strong>       The confessions of co-accused are not evidence but if there is other evidence on which a conviction can be based, they can be referred to as lending some assurance to the verdict. AIR 1956 SC 56+AIR 1968 SC 832.<br/> <br/><strong>88.</strong>       The Tribunal convicted those accused considering their absconsion for certain period of time, and the prosecution also tried to make nexus between the absconsion and the crime of murder.<br/> <br/><strong>89.</strong>       According to the submissions from prosecution and observations made by the Tribunal, it indicate that some accused remained absconding from the place of occurrence for certain period, which is a circumstances leading to the inference of guilt. In our view it is mere submissions and observation of the Court below. The prosecution measurably failed to establish by evidence that soon after the occurrence, the accused had any responsibilities to discharge their duties towards the occurrence. It is well settled that mere abscondence cannot always be a circumstances leading to the inference of guilt of the accused. In this case, there is no evidence against the accused. Hence their subsequent abscondence cannot be treated as a circumstances leading to the inference of involvement in the crime. Mere abscondence cannot always be a circumstances which should lead to an inference of guilt of the accused. Sometimes out of fear and self respect and to avoid unnecessary harassment even an innocent person remain absconding for sometime.<br/> <br/><strong>90.</strong>       With this regard reliance are being placed in the cases of Monsur Ali Vs. The State 13 BLC 196. Similar views were taken in the cases of State Vs. Badsha Molla, 41 DLR 11, State Vs. Mofijuddin 4 BLD-481=10 BLC-93, State Vs. Lalu Mia, 39 DLR(AD)117, State Vs.

The State 13 MLR-88.<br/> <br/><strong>91.</strong>       In the light of discussions made above and the preponderant judicial views emerging out of the authorities referred to above, we are of the view that the prosecution successfully proved the charge against accused Milon and Rabiul alias Hubul beyond all reasonable doubt but failed to prove the charge against accused Aslam, Musaddek, Helal,  Mannan alias A.

The petitioner is the mother of the detenu child. She has been residing in London, England for the last 6 years. Currently, she has been enrolled in two years’ diploma course in business management and marketing at London Reading College, London, England. She has also been employed part time as a child care worker at City Literacy Institute. Respondent No. 1 is the father of the detenu. He had been employed in a number of jobs, most recently as a kitchen porter in Park Town Casino, London until his sudden departure from the U.K in December 2008.    <br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>         On 6.11.1998, the detenu Ayon was born to the petitioner and respondent No. 1 and he is now ten years old. He has been living with his parents in London since he was three years old. After arrival in London, the detenu was diagnosed with significant psychological and physical health problems and had been suffering from chronically poor growth and difficulty in eating. He requires regular treatment and care for his condition and has been receiving such specialist treatment and care while living   in London. The detenu has been enrolled in the reception class (nursery) at the Holy Trinity St. Sailors Primary School, Camden, London. He had been studying there for the past six years prior to his wrongful removal from the petitioner’s custody. The detenu had been receiving specialized support for his speech and language difficulties. He had been cared for and nurtured exclusively by his mother (petitioner), since his birth and had never been parted from her until his removal from her custody by respondent No. 1 on 29.12.2008.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>         The petitioner is aggrieved by the deceitful removal of the detenu by the respondents from her custody without her consent. As a result, the detenu is being deprived of his right to access to his mother and also to appropriate and specialized healthcare, nutrition and education facilities. In September 2008, the petitioner and respondent No. 1 had a blazing argument after which respondent No. 1 forcibly prevented the petitioner from leaving the house stating that if she were to leave, he would take no responsibility for her or for the detenu child.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>         In October 2008, the petitioner left the house with the detenu and started living in a rented house. By mutual agreement, respondent No. 1 had regular contact with the detenu, speaking to him daily on the telephone every weekend but did not make any payment towards his maintenance including food or clothing except for the fees for a coaching centre attended by the detenu. In November 2008, respondent No. 1 informed the petitioner that he wished to take the detenu child on a five days’ family visit to his relatives in Ireland. Respondent No. 1 also repeatedly assured the petitioner that the child would be returned to her custody within five days.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>         On 31.12.2008, the petitioner came to learn that respondent No. 1 left for Dhaka, Bangladesh on Ettihad Airlines accompanying by Mrs. Rokhsana Chowdhury, aunt of the detenu. On 31.12.2008, the petitioner’s sister telephoned respondent No. 2 who informed her that neither respondent No. 1 nor the child was there and that he did not know their whereabouts.  On 1.1.2009, respondent No. 1 informed the petitioner over telephone that he is a Bangladeshi and that according to Bangladesh law the child was his and refused to let her to speak to the child. The petitioner made a missing child complaint with the Barnet Police Station, which was recorded as Case No. 08MIS031027. The police thereupon questioned Mr. Mamun Chowdhury, uncle of the detenu, and thereafter arrested Mrs. Rokshana Chowdhury who admitted that she accompanied respondent No. 1 and the detenu child to Bangladesh. The petitioner thereupon filed a petition before the High Court of Justice, Family Division, Principal Registry, in London (England) in respect of the detenu child and recovery of his custody against respondent No. 1 and Mr. Mamun Chowdhury. The petitioner’s Barrister in London on 23.1.2009 contacted the respondents by telephone but they refused to let the child speak to the petitioner. The High Court of Justice, Family Division, in London on 26.1.2009 was pleased to pass an order making the detenu child a ward of the Court and further directing respondent No. 1 to return him to the jurisdiction of England.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>         The petitioner returned to Bangladesh on 12.2.2009 after making all effort to take the detenu from the custody of the respondents but to no avail. Therefore, the petitioner had to file the instant Writ Petition and obtained the Rule Nisi.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>         Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 filed an affidavit-in-opposition denying all the material allegations made in the Writ Petition. Their case, in short, is that the detenu was not diagnosed with psychological or mental disability. He had been studying at the school with other students for the last six years. The detenu successfully passed the exams in previous years after competing with the other students. After his coming to Bangladesh, the detenu was taken to the doctor who found no psychological or mental disability in the detenu. The detenu is about ten years old, who can form his own opinion. The petitioner was never subjected to torture or oppression. The detenu is a Muslim child who is above seven years of age. According to Muslim law his father (respondent No. 1) is entitled to retain the child in his custody. Moreover, according to section 17 of the Guardian and Wards Act, 1890 the paramount consideration will be the welfare of the minor. Since the petitioner is a lone mother in the U.K. and since she is on student visa there, she can only work limited hours. It would be difficult for her to maintain herself and the child. After attending class and doing the job, she would have a little time left for the child. The detenu child is now with his father who is the legal guardian of the child. The child is now growing up with care of his grandmother, uncle and aunty. So, the welfare of the child will be best protected if he is allowed to remain in the custody of his father.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>         Ms. Sara Hossain, learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner, submits that the detenu was illegally removed from the custody of her mother while he was in London and as such the removal of the detenu from the custody of the petitioner is without lawful authority. She further submits that though the detenu is aged about ten years, he cannot be removed from the custody of her mother without the consent of the petitioner. The learned Advocate lastly submits that the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration and that the petitioner being the mother is entitled to his custody till she remarries.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>       Mr. Md. Ashraf Ali, learned Advocate for respondent Nos. 1 and 2, on the other hand, submits that admittedly the child detenu is aged about ten years and that according to the Mohammedan law, the father being the legal guardian is entitled to the custody of his son (detenu). He further submits that the mother is a student and that she has been working part time and therefore, it is not possible on her part to safeguard the welfare of the detenu.<br/> <br/><strong>11.       </strong>Admittedly, the detenu was in the custody of the petitioner. It has not been denied in the affidavit-in-opposition that respondent No. 1 did not remove the detenu from the custody of the petitioner and that the detenu was brought to Bangladesh without her consent. From the statement made in Writ Petition, it appears that the petitioner made a missing child complaint with the Barnet Police Station, Camden, London, which was recorded as Case No. 08MIS031027. The detenu was taken from the custody of his mother while he was in U.K. The law of the U.K. does not permit such a removal. In addition, Islamic Sharia law does not have any application in the U.K although Dr. Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, suggested adopting parts of Islamic Sharia law to resolve martial disputes or financial matters of the Muslims living there. But the British Prime Minister Gordon Brown believed that British law should be based on British values. (Internet edition of BBC news dated 7.2.2008). Father is not even the natural guardian in U.K where Children Act, 1989 in section 2(4) provides that the rule of law that father is the natural guardian of the legitimate child is abolished. According to Mohammedan law of hizanat, it is no doubt that father is entitled to the custody of his minor son when he attains the age of seven years. But the law relating to the custody does not permit deceitful removal of the detenu from the custody of his mother while he was in a foreign country where such removal is not at all permissible. The rule of hizanat has not given any unfettered right to the father to remove a minor son aged about 10 years from the custody of his mother at will. By resorting to deceptive means, respondent No. 1 took the temporary custody of detenu from his mother on pretext of going to a family visit to Ireland and then brought the detenu to Bangladesh. By doing so, respondent No. 1 has taken law in his own hand without waiting for adjudication of the custody and welfare of the child in an appropriate forum. <br/> <br/><strong>12.       </strong>Meanwhile, on 1.3.2009 the petitioner filed Family Suit No. 126 of 2009 before the 3<sup>rd</sup> Court of Additional Assistant Judge, and Family Court, Dhaka praying for the custody of child under section 25(1) of the Guardian of Wards Act, 1890 read with section 5(ka) of the Family Court Ordinance, 1985. It is, of course, true that the question of welfare will be dealt with by the Family Court which will take into account in whose custody the welfare of the child will be best protected. After issuance of the Rule, we directed the learned Advocate for respondent Nos. 1 and 2 for production of the child as it is evident from the order dated 2.3.2009. Accordingly, the detenu was produced on 9.3.2009. Both of us had the occasion to speak to the detenu. We found that the detenu could not speak properly and that he was not looking healthy as well. Sitting here in the writ jurisdiction we cannot decide the welfare of the child but we have observed the physical condition of the child while deciding the question of illegal detention. The Family Court must take into account the physical condition of the child as well as the law involved for deciding the question of custody. The age of the detenu can not be the sole basis for deciding the question of custody. In this connection reliance may be made on the case of Md. Abu Baker Siddique Vs. S.M.A Bakar and Others, 38 DLR (AD) 106. The above case arose out of Guardian and Wards Act, 1890 and the boy was above seven years of age. The learned District Judge found that welfare of the boy would best served if he was allowed to live with his mother’s relations in preference to the father. The judgment of the learned District Judge was upheld upto the Appellate Division which, among other findings, held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Indeed, the principle of Islamic Law (in the instant case, the rule of hizanat or guardianship of a minor child as stated in Hanafi School) has to be regarded, <u>but deviation therefrom would seem permissible as the paramount consideration should be the child’s welfare”</u>.  (Emphasis is ours)</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>13.</strong>       In this connection we would like to refer to the case of Rumana Afrin Vs. Fakir Ashrafuddin Ahmed and Others (1996) 1 BLC 517 in which this Division held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Thus, the Islamic law of hidnat is that the mother has absolute right against the father over the minor child till she remarries. It is to be noticed that the hadith quoted above does not specifically state that the right of hidnat will cease if she remarries. The hadith indicates that the right of hidnat of the mother then will be at par with that of the father and the case of the mother versus the father is to be decided vis-a-vis the minor’s welfare.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>14.</strong>       In this case Abdul Jalil Vs. Sharon Laily Begum Jalil (1998) 50 DLR (AD) 55 the Appellate Division has held that a Writ Petition at the instance of the mother in the form of <em>habeas corpus</em> is maintainable against wrongful removal of the children by the father from her custody during pendency of the Family Suit for guardianship. The Appellate Division has also held: “It is well settled that in matters concerning the custody of the minor children, the paramount consideration is the welfare of the minor and not the legal right of this and that particular party.”  <br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>       The General Assembly of the United Nations adopted the International Convention of the Rights of the Child, 1989. The document is a binding treaty to which 176 nations including Bangladesh became “state parties”. Article 3(1) of the Convention provides “In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institution, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.”<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>       We do not like to make any comment about the judgments and the convention discussed above. The Family Court will look into the cases referred to above and come to a finding in whose custody the welfare of the detenu will be better protected. In short, the child’s welfare is the supreme consideration, irrespective of the rights and wrongs of the contending parties.<br/> <br/><strong>17.       </strong>But the fact remains that the detenu was illegally removed from the custody of his mother while he was in the U.K.  We have already stated that the law of U.K. does not permit such removal of a child from the custody of his mother without her consent. Before adjudication of the Family Suit the detenu must be restored to his earlier custody, that is, in the custody of the petitioner. Therefore, we are of the view that removal of the detenu from the custody of his mother is without lawful authority and that he is being held in the custody of the respondents in an unlawful manner.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>       Any delay in determining the question of custody is likely to prejudice the welfare of the child. Therefore, we are of the view that the Family Court should dispose of the Family Suit within a specified time. Till disposal of the suit, we would like to ensure that the mother shall remain in Bangladesh and she must deposit her passport with the concerned Family Court.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>       In this result, the Rule is made absolute and the detention of the detenu Syed Shafin Ahmed  (Ayon), aged about 10 years in the custody of respondents is declared to be unlawful and he is being held in their custody in an unlawful manner.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>       Respondent No. 1 is directed to handover the detenu to the custody of the petitioner by 23.3.2009 in presence of the learned Advocates for both the sides. Before handing over the detenu in the custody of the petitioner, the petitioner shall deposit her passport with the concerned Family Court which shall retain the passport till disposal of the suit. The Family Court is directed to dispose of the Family Suit within one month from the date of receipt of this judgment. The Family Court is also directed not to allow adjournment to either of the parties. During pendency of the suit in the Family Court, the father (respondent No. 1) shall have the right to visit his son at a conveniently agreed time, place and period twice a week.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>       Let a copy of the judgment be communicated to the 3<sup>rd</sup> Court of Additional Assistant Judge, Family Court, Dhaka by a special messenger of this Court.<br/> <br/>      There is no order as to costs.        <br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>
