Ruhul Quddus, J:</strong></span><br/> <br/>This appeal at the instance of the plaintiffs is directed against judgment and decree dated 17.6.2004 passed by the Joint District Judge, Second Court, Dhaka rejecting the plaint in Title Suit No.89 of 2003. The suit was instituted for declaration of title and perpetual injunction for restraining the Government-officials from disturbing the plaintiffs’ peaceful possession on the suit property and from transferring it to any other person.<br/><br/>Plaintiffs’ case, in brief, is that the suit property originally belonged to one Md. Ramjan Ali, who being a migrated refugee from India, got it allotted from the Government of erstwhile East Pakistan by an indenture of agreement dated 29.7.1966 followed by another deed of conveyance dated 8.11.1969. After independence of Bangladesh, the said Ramjan Ali owed allegiance to Bangladesh and his name was included in the voter list dated 30.1.1973. He paid remaining installments on 17.4.1978 against the suit property and acquired sole proprietary right over the same.<br/><br/>Subsequently the said Ramjan Ali sold the suit property to the plaintiffs’ father and predecessor-in-interest Mukhlesuddin Ahmed by a registered sale deed dated 11.5.1978 and handed over possession thereof to him. Even after the said transfer, Ramjan Ali was all along present in Bangladesh. He died in Dhaka on 2.2.1980.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the area of Mirpur Police Station was declared as Mirpur Paurashava, and Holding No.372 was created against the suit property. Since then the plaintiffs were paying all taxes and utility charges to the Paurashava against the said holding.<br/><br/>Plaintiffs’ further case is that the suit property was declared abandoned and published as such in the ‘kha’ list of abandoned property on 23.9.1986, although in a prior inquiry it was found that the original allottee Ramjan Ali had sold it to Mukhlesuddin Ahmed, who was in possession thereof.<br/><br/>Thereafter, Mukhlesuddin Ahmed filed Case No.7 of 2001 (kha) in the First Court of Settlement, Dhaka for release of the said property, which was rejected on 1.12.2001. It is alleged that in rejecting the case, the Tribunal did not examine the thump impression of the original allottee Ramjan Ali by an expert and illegally arrived at a finding that the sale deed was not executed by him (Ramjan Ali).<br/><br/>Challenging the said decision, Mukhlesu-ddin Ahmed filed Writ Petition No.1238 of 2002. The High Court Division rejected it summarily by its judgment and order dated 17.3.2002. Then he moved in the Appellate Division with Civil Petition No.807 of 2002, which was also rejected in limini.<br/><br/>The plaintiffs came to know on 1.4.2003 that the defendant-officials were trying to settle the property elsewhere, thus the cause of action for filing the present suit arose.<br/><br/>The Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Public Works as defendant No.1 entered appearance and filed an application under Order VII rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure for rejection of the plaint on the grounds that the suit was barred by article 14 of President’s Order No.16 of 1972 and also under article 6 (b) of The Ordinance No. XLIV of 1985, and that the abandoned character of the suit property was finally decided up to the Appellate Division.<br/><br/>Against the said application for rejection of the plaint, the plaintiffs filed a written objection on the facts and grounds stated therein.<br/><br/>Learned Joint District Judge heard the application and allowed the same by his order dated 17.6.2004 and thereby rejected the plaint on the ground that the suit was barred by law. Against the said judgment, the plaintiffs preferred the instant First Appeal and obtained an ad-interim order of injunction in the connected Civil Rule.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Lutfor Rahman Mandal, learned Advocate appearing for the appellants submits that the Court of Settlement had no jurisdiction to decide title of the suit property and as such question of title between the parties is still open to be decided by a competent civil Court. Since the present suit is for declaration of title and other consequential relief, the plaint cannot be rejected on the ground of finality of the decision passed by the Court of Settlement. He further submits that the Government did not file any written objection denying the material allegations of the application, still the Court of Settlement rejected the application without proper adjudication of the issues whether the original allottee Ramjan Ali had left Bangladesh leaving the property uncared for; whether he died and was buried in Dhaka, and whether the authority served any statutory notice upon the occupants or did serve any other notice to meet natural justice. Under the facts and circumstances of the present case, the ouster clauses are not applicable and the civil Court is fully competent to adjudicate the issues and decide title of the suit land on that basis.<br/><br/>On the jurisdiction of civil Court, Mr. Mandal refers to the cases of Mohammad Jamil Vs. Improvement Trust, Rawalpindi, 17 DLR (SC) 520; Secretary of State, represented by the Collector of South Arcot Vs. Mask and Company, Indians Appeals Vol. LXVII 222; Anisminic Ltd. Vs. Foreign Compensation Commission, 2 A C 147; Sm. Krishnamoni Vs. Baser Mondal and others, 1963 AIR Calcutta 225; The Province of East Pakistan and others Vs. Sirajul Huq Patwari and another, and some other cases in bunch, PLD 1966 Supreme Court 854; and People’s Republic of Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Public Works Vs. Chairman, Court of Settlement and others, 50 DLR (AD) 93.<br/><br/>On the other hand Ms. Promila Biswas, learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the Government-respondents submits that the decision of the Court of Settlement reached finality with dismissal of the civil petition filed by late Mukhlesuddin Ahmed, father of the plaintiffs. Thus the abandoned character of the suit property was finally established and it vested in Government. Now the heirs of the said Mukhlesuddin Ahmed cannot claim any title over the same property against the Government. The suit is clearly barred by law.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions advanced by learned Advocates of both the sides, examined the materials on record and gone through the decisions cited. It appears that the Court of Settlement considered and discussed the evidence both oral and docume-ntary as adduced by the petitioner and observed that “<em>it also appears from the Govt. file No.S-7/AP-145/85 of the Ministry of Works that a legal notice in page No.1 of the file N/s5(Q) was served upon the possessor, petitioner Muklesuddin for surrendering possession</em>”. The Tribunal disbelieved Ramjan Ali’s presence in Bangladesh at the relevant time as no citizenship certificate, non-option certificate, voter list or any other document in support of his presence was produced. The Tribunal also disbelieved the sale deed of Mukhlesuddin Ahmed because of non-production of any original via-deed and non-examination of any attesting witness.<br/><br/>All the cases cited by Mr. Mandal, learned Advocate for the appellants are distinguishable. Of those, only the case of 50 DLR (AD) 93 is related to abandoned property, wherein two claimants were fighting for one property claiming their diverse title. Those claimants filed two separate applications for release of that property and the Court of Settlement allowed both the applications deciding the property not to be abandoned. Challenging the said decision, the Government unsuccessfully moved a writ petition in the High Court Division and thereafter, a civil petition before the Appellate Division. In the leave petition, learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for Government petitioner submitted that the Court of Settlement was wrong in allowing the applications of two applicants on conflicting claims. Their Lordships of the Appellate Division dismissed the leave petition replying the said point in the following manner:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The Court of Settlement was not a Court for determining the title of the rival claimants. It was a Court for determination whether the case property was an abandoned property or not. Since the Court of Settlement and the High Court Division both found that the case property is not an abandoned property it will be for the rival claimants themselves to sort out who is the legal owner thereof and to what extent, if not already determined by a Court of law.” </em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the present case, there is only one claimant, who filed application before the Court of Settlement and claimed the suit property not to be an abandoned property. No dispute over title against any other individual is raised. The Tribunal rejected the application on consideration of the abandoned character of the said property. The genuineness of the petitioner’s sale deed was a collateral issue related with the abandoned character of the suit property, which the petitioner Mukhesuddin Ahmed could not prove to rebut the conclusiveness of abandoned character of the property. The case of 50 DLR (AD) 93 is, therefore, not applicable here.<br/><br/>The facts regarding to filing of application before the Court of Settlement by the plaintiffs’ father Mukhlesuddin Ahmed for exclusion of the suit property from the list of abandoned property, rejection of the said application by the Tribunal’s decision dated 1.12.2001 and its affirmation up to the Appellate Division, have been clearly stated in the plaint.<br/><br/>The decision of the Court of Settlement thus reached finality. Its legal consequence is that the property vested in Government, which can own, possess and dispose of it in any lawful manner. The plaintiffs, who are heirs of late Mukhlesuddin Ahmed (applicant before the Court of Settlement) cannot reopen the case raising the question of title in a disguised form. If the present suit is allowed to continue, there will be no end of litigation. It is barred by law and should be buried at the earliest opportunity.<br/><br/>This is correct that the Court of Settlement has a limited jurisdiction only to look into whether a particular property answers to the definition of abandoned property or not. But for that purpose it has jurisdiction also to see whether the applicant has <em>locus standi </em>to claim the property in question. In the present case the Court of Settlement found the transfer in favour of Mukhlesuddin Ahmed not to be genuine. This is in substance a decision on <em>locus standi </em>of the applicant in negative.<br/><br/>It is clear that the heirs of late Muklesuddin Ahmed (applicant before the Court of Settlement) have brought the present suit to continue with their possession over the abandoned property and it is definite that the suit will bring no result for the plaintiffs. In such a suit, the Court can also invoke its inherent power and reject the plaint taking recourse to section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, even if it cannot be rejected under Order VII rule 11 of the Code. [reliance placed on 20 BLD (AD) 278].<br/><br/>In view of the discussions made above and the decision cited, we do not find any illegality in the impugned order of rejection of the plaint. The appeal merits no consideration and is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>Accordingly the appeal is dismissed, however, without any order as to cost. The connected Civil Rule is also discharged and the stay granted therein is vacated.<br/><br/>Send down the lower Court’s record.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Akram Hossain Chowdhury, J:</u></strong></span><br/> <br/>This Rule was issued at the instance of the informant petitioner calling upon the Deputy Commissioner, Mymensingh to show cause as to why the impugned Judgment and order dated 03.05.1993 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Mymensingh in Criminal Revision No. 93 of 1992 affirming those dated 06.02.1992 passed by the learned Upazilla Magistrate, Fulbaria, Mymensingh in Fulbaria P.S. Case No. 5 dated 19.01.1989 correspon-ding to G.R. No. 5(2)1989 under Section 302/34 of the Penal Code, allowing the CID to proceed with the further investigation of the case, should not be quashed and/or such other or further order or orders passed as to this Court may seem fit and proper.<br/><br/>The petitioner being informant lodged a First Information Report with the Fulbaria Police Station being Fulbaria P.S. Case No.5 dated 19.01.1989 corresponding to G.R. No. 5(2) of 1989 implicating the 11(eleven) accused persons for committing offence under Section 302/34 of the Penal Code. In the said case the police submitted charge sheet on 05.01.1989 against all the FIR named accused under section 302/34 of the Penal Code and the said charge sheet was sent to the Upazilla Magistrate, Fulbaria, Mymensingh for accep-tance. The learned Magistrate by its order dated 14.4.1989 accepted the same but soon after the said charge sheet CID vide its Memo dated 23.05.1989 prayed for permission to hold further investigation into the case; which was allowed by the learned Additional District Ma-gistrate (ADM), Mymensingh on 08.07.1989. Against the said order of further investigation the informant filed a Criminal Revision being No.265 of 1989 before the Sessions Judge, My-mensingh. Subsequently, the learned Sessions Judge after hearing the parties by his Judgment and order dated 04.02.1990 allowing the revision set aside the order of the ADM. Then the state being petitioner filed an application before the High Court Division under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure challenging the said proceeding and subsequent order of the learned Sessions Judge, Mymen-shingh dated 04.02.1990 which was ultimately allowed by the High Court Division on 31.01.1991 and thus allowed the CID for further investigation.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the said Judgment and order of the High Court Division, the informant moved in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court and the Hon’ble Judges of the Appellate Division upheld the High Court’s Judgment and order dated 31.01.1991. Thereby the case was sent back to the concerned Court of Magistrate to adjudicate the matter but the informant again filed an application stating that since the CID could not investigate the case within the stipulated period, the further investigation should be stopped; upon which the learned Magistrate, Fulbaria, Mymensingh by his order dated 16.01.1992 directed the CID to stop the investigation and also ordered to transmit the case record to the Sessions Judge, Mymensingh for trial. Then on 06.02.1992 all the charge sheeted accused persons appearing before the Upazilla Magistrate prayed for enlarging them on bail and simultaneously filed an application for reviving the order of the learned Magistrate dated 16.01.1992; by which the learned Magistrate stopped the further investigation by CID. In the said application it has been contended <em>inter-alia</em> that the time limit of the case has been elapsed due to a revisional application was filed by the prosecution before the learned Sessions Judge, Mymensingh challenging the order of further investigation by CID and then the matter was moved up to the Appellate Division, as such, the investigation by CID could not be comple-ted within the stipulated period; therefore the statutory period of investigation should not be counted in the present case. The learned Magistrate after hearing both the parties by his order dated 06.02.1992 allowing the said application revived his earlier order dated 16.01.1992 and again directed the CID for further investigation.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Magistrate dated 06.02.1992, the informant as petitioner again filed a Criminal Revision being No.93 of 1992 before the learned Sessions Judge, Mymensingh, and the learned Sessions Judge after hearing both the parties by his judgment and order dated 03.05.1993 affirming the judgment and order of the Magistrate dated 06.02.1992, dismissed the said revision.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the said order of the learned Sessions Judge, Mymenshingh dated 03.05.1993, the informant as petitioner by filing an application under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure obtained the present rule.<br/><br/>Mr. Abdul Baset Majumder, the learned Advocate appearing with Ms. Sanda Ghosh, Advocate for the petitioner submitted that by the impugned judgment and order the learned Sessions Judge, Mymensingh after a long lapse of time dismissing the revision and upholding the order of the Magistrate allowed the CID to re-investigate the case after long lapse of more then three years; which is nothing but an abuse of the process of the Court. Whereas the police after proper investigation submitted charge sheet against the FIR named accused persons earlier and since the case was being ready for trial no further investigation is required. Hence, the instant rule is to be absolute.<br/><br/>On the other hand Gazi Md. Mamunur Rashid, the learned Assistant Attorney General opposing the rule submitted that there is no bar in holding further investigation under Section 173(3)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure though a charge sheet has been submitted. Thus, the learned Sessions Judge, Mymensingh has not committed any illegality in passing the impugned order and the said judgment and order deserves no interference. As such, the instant rule is liable to be discharged.<br/><br/>Heard the learned Advocates, perused the materials on record and gone through the impugned Judgment and order of the Court below. It appears from the record that a similar application in a form of Criminal Revision was earlier filed by the prosecution at the instance of the present petitioner which has been moved up to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, on which the present issue has already been settled by the Appellate Division that the further investigation should have to be done by the CID and there is no bar in the eye of law for further investigation. The period as claimed has been elapsed was happened due to the pendency of the several legal proceeding initiated by both the parties one after another up to the apex Court and the said period should not be counted under Section 167(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure for holding investigation of the case and there is no bar for further investigation under Section 173(3)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure even though a charge sheet has already been submitted. As such, the investigation could not be held by CID within the time limit in the instant case.<br/><br/>Having considered the above we are of the opinion that since the same issue has already been settled by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court earlier upon elaborate discussion and observations and the learned Session Judge, Mymensingh relying on the said observations of the Supreme Court passed the impugned judgment and order dated 03.05.1993 which do not calls for any interference.<br/><br/>In view of the above we find no merit in the rule, thus, inclined to discharge the same.<br/><br/>In the result, the rule is discharged. The impugned judgment and order dated 03.05.1993 passed by the Sessions Judge, Mymensingh, in Criminal Revision No. 93 of 1992 affirming those dated 06.12.1992 passed by the Upazilla Magistrate, Fulbaria, Mymens-ingh allowing the CID for further investigation into the case is hereby upheld and to be maintained. The order of stay granted earlier by this Court on 18.01.1996 is recalled and vacated. The CID, Mymenshingh is directed to file its report within the stipulated period as provided by law after holding investigation into the case from the date of receipt of this judgment and accordingly the Court below is at liberty to proceed with the case in accordance with law.    <br/><br/>Communicate this judgment and order to the Court concerned at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Ruhul Quddus, J:</strong></span><br/><br/>This Rule at the instance of the accused-petitioners was issued on an application under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Proced-ure for quashment of the proceedings in C. R. Case No. 69 of 1992 that was pending before the Thana Magistrate, Dashmina, Patuakhali and its order dated 22.6.1992 taking cogniza-nce of offence under sections 427, 447 and 109 of the Penal Code against the accused.<br/><br/>Complainant Nur Mohammad, Tahsildar of Dashmina Union Land Office, Patuakhali sent a petition of complaint on 20.6.1992 to the Assistant Commissioner (Land), Dashmina alleging, <em>inter alia</em>, that petitioner No.1 was the President of Bangladesh Krishok Federation while petitioner No. 2 was President of Krishani Sabha. All the accused persons being united instigated the people to occupy <em>khas </em>land of the Government stating that they would allot the land to the people. They had illegally occupied the <em>khas </em>land as described in the schedule of complaint petition on 16.1.1992 and inducted three hundred seventy-six families therein, who demarcated the land and erected dwelling houses thereon, and thereby changed the nature and character of the land causing loss of Taka 1,14,500/- (one lac fourteen thousand five hundred) only to the Government.<br/><br/>The Assistant Commissioner forwarded the petition of complaint to the Thana Magistr-ate, Dashmina with a covering letter containing Memo No.194-Dash dated 22.6.1992, upon which the Magistrate took cognizance of offence against all the accused including the petitioners on the same day. The petitioners voluntarily surrendered before the Magistrate and obtained bail on 5.7.1992. Subsequently they moved in this Court with the present application under section 561 A of the Code challenging the proceedings and also the order of taking cognizance.<br/><br/>It appears that the learned Advocate for petitioners, Mr. Formanullah Khan died. Thereafter, notices in form N-10 were served upon them, but no one appeared. In view of its long pendency for nearly twenty years, we take it up for hearing and allow the Deputy Attorney General to make his submissions.<br/><br/>Mr. Khizir Hayat, learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the State-opposite party opposes the Rule without filing any counter affidavit and submits that the petition of complaint discloses offence of mischief and criminal trespass on the part of the petitioners and as such the Magistrate rightly took cognizance against them.<br/><br/>The petitioners have annexed some documents with the application. Of them, annex-D is a notice of eviction dated 20.4.1992 issued by the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Patuakhali asking petitioner No.1 to vacate the case land to the extent of his possession within 10.5.1992. Annex-E, a demi official letter dated 3.5.1992 issued by the Member of Parliament from Patuakhali-3 constituency addressing the Hon’ble Minister for Land, wherein it was mentioned that a class of influential persons and <em>joteders </em>illegally occupied vast land rose out of river bed. The landless farmers and labourers of that area were agitating and launching movement in a disciplined manner demanding settlement of the land to the landless, but without any result. The Member of Parliament raised the issue on the floor, when the Hon’ble Minister for Land made a statement assuring to dissolve the matter. It was further mentioned that on 30.7.1991 thousands of landless women, under the leadership of petitioner No.1, went on hunger strike for fulfillment of their demand. In that situation, a committee headed by the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) under instruction of the Hon’ble Minister visited the spot, made an enquiry and assured them to cancel all illegal settlements and to prepare a correct list of landless farmers and labourers, so that the <em>khas </em>land could be settled in their favour. On such assurance, they withdrew from hunger strike. In spite of all the assurance from different levels of the State, the vast land was still under illegal occupation of the <em>joteders </em>to the deprivation of the landless, who were legally entitled to get the land in accordance with law, policy and program of the Government. The Member of Parliament, however, made some recommendations to the Hon'ble Minister for his consideration. Annex-F, a telex copy sent on 4.5.1992 from the Ministry of Land to the Deputy Commissioner, Patuakhali shows that the Ministry repeatedly asked the District Administration to stop eviction of the landless, who took shelter in the land in question.<br/>Authenticity of the documents referred to above or the contents therein are not denied by the State. Since the documents fall within the definition of public documents and are not denied by the State, this Court can take notice of the same and consider those in deciding the present application otherwise to meet the ends of justice, despite these are defense materials and generally not considered except in due course of trial.<br/><br/>It transpires from the documents referred to above that against whom the present crimi-nal case was initiated were landless farmers and labourers. They were organized under the banner of Bangladesh Krisok Federation and Krisani Sabha, two organizations working for the landless. It also transpires that the vast land rose out of river bed was illegally occupied by the <em>joteders</em>. The District Administration did not take proper step for eviction of the <em>joteders </em>and settle the land to landless farmers and labourers, which they were legally entitled to get.<br/><br/>In view of the directive made under article 7 of the Land Reform Ordinance, 1984 and also the National Land Reform Program initiated by the Government as mentioned in section 41 of the Land Management Manual, 1990 and the implementing guideline framed thereunder, it was the legal obligation of the State to settle the khas land to the landless farmers and labourers, whom the petitioners organizationally represent. It did not do so, instead a petty-officer like Tahshilder prosecu-ted them for taking shelter in the land of Government in assertion of their right to life guaranteed under the Constitution. It is pertin-ent to mention that in urban area, under similar socio-economic condition, the poor and help-less people float and flock together in certain vacant spaces and start living there by constructing huts thereon. In number of cases against eviction of such people, this Court observed that our Constitution, both in funda-mental principles of State policy and in preservation of fundamental rights provided that the State shall direct its policy towards securing the citizens’ right to life that includes right to shelter and livelihood, and thus restrained the Government from evicting the slum dwellers without rehabilitation. (reliance placed on Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust and others Vs. Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and others, 13 BLC 384; Ain-o-Salish Kendra and others Vs. Government of Bangladesh and others, 19 BLD 488; Kalam and others Vs. Bangladesh and others, 21 BLD 446). So, if the instant criminal case, allegedly for entering into the <em>khas </em>land and erecting dwelling houses thereon for shelters of some landless farmers and labourers is allowed to proceed against them, it will virtually impair their right to life guaranteed under the Constitution. People’s movement towards implementation of law or fulfillment of any program or commitment of the Government or to establish their legal and fundamental rights cannot constitute any criminal offence. Their actions taken in course of such movement should also be considered with a lenient view.<br/><br/>In the present case, petition of complaint was filed on 20.6.1992 and the time of alleged occurrence was shown as 16.1.1992. There is no explanation as to why there was such inordinate delay in filing the complaint. The Magistrate took cognizance of offence under section 427 of the Penal Code against the petitioners allegedly for committing mischief causing damage to <em>khas </em>land of the Gove-rnment and also under section 447 of the Code for committing criminal trespass into the land. But from the facts and circumstances of the case it does not appear that the helpless farmers and labourers including the petitioners intentionally did any wrongful loss or damage to the public or any person or that they caused destruction to the <em>khas </em>land by entering therein for shelter. It also does not appear that they entered into the land with any motive/intent to commit an offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy the person in possession i.e. the Government. Therefore, the necessary legal ingredients of offence under sections 427 and 447 of the Code are also absent here. From the facts and circumstances of the case it cannot be logically inferred that the petitioners had any dominant criminal intention, even if they had entered into the land. It rather appears that the two organizations were struggling to get the <em>khas </em>land free from illegal occupation of the <em>joteders </em>and settle it in favour of the landless.<br/><br/>There is another aspect to consider in the present case. The complainant, a Tahshilder sent the petition of compliant to the Assistant Commissioner (Land), who forwarded the same to the concerned Magistrate. Both of them did it in their official capacity. When the Ministry of Land itself instructed the District Administration, Patuakhali not to evict the landless, who took shelters in the land in question (vide annex-F), they had no authority to prosecute the case against the policy of their controlling Ministry.<br/><br/>In view of the discussions made above, we do not find any ingredients of offence under sections 427 and 447 of the Code or any other criminal offence against the accused-petitioners and also do not find that the complainant has got any authority to prosecute the case in his official capacity. The Rule thus merits consideration.<br/><br/>Accordingly the Rule is made absolute. The order dated 22.6.1992 passed by the Thana Magistrate, Dashmina, Patuakhali in C. R. Case No. 69 of 1992 taking cognizance of offence under sections 427, 447 and 109 of the Penal Code against the accused is set aside and proceedings of the case is also quashed.<br/>Communicate a copy of this judgment.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

The learned Judge framed issue as to the maintainability of the suit and after hearing both side rejected the plaint on the ground of maintainability. In passing the order, learned judge found that against the application filed under order VII rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, plaintiff did not file any written objection as plaintiff submits as “বাদী/প্রতিপক্ষ আপত্তি দাখিল করেন নাই এবং মৌখিকভাবে জানান যে, তাহাদের আপত্তি দাখিলের আবশ্যকতা নাই।”<br/><br/>Learned Judge after hearing both the parties, was of the opinion that, by Dhaka gazette notification dated 29.2.1956 and also in 1965, at serial No.31, rent receiving interest of Surujbala Bibi and others have been taken over by the Government and also the learned judge on consideration of C.S and R.S. khatian, finally came to the decision that, plaintiff has no title in instituting the suit.<br/><br/>Against this judgment and decree, plaintiff filed this appeal before this Court, out of time of by 191 days and filed an application for condonation of delay of the aforesaid days. This Court issued rule upon the defendant-respondents to show cause as to why the delay in filing the appeal should not be condoned.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Abdul Haque, learned Advocate, appearing for the plaintiff-appellant, submits that, the delay has been explained in the supplementary-affidavit, as such this Court should condone the delay. Learned Advocate frankly submits that, originally, in the application for condonation of delay, delay of 191 days was not been properly explained. Learned Advocate further submits that, since the plaintiff filed advolerum Court fees of Taka more than forty thousands, the delay should be condoned.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Khalilur Rahman, learned Advocate, appearing for the defendant-opposite parties, submits that, usually he did not raise objection for condonation of delay of 191 days in preferring the appeal but he submits that, no effective result will be available to the plaintiff, save and except dragging this matter for unlimited period and thereby hanging the defendants in condoning the delay, as plaintiff failed to prove title for instituting the suit and did not file any written objection against the averments made in the application for rejection of the plaint, in Court below, as such the delay should not be condoned. Learned Advocate taken us to the annexures with the counter-affidavit filed against the application for condonation of delay, particularly annexure-1, and submits that by gazette notification published on Monday, March 24, 1952, in exercise of the power conferred by sub-section (1) of section 3 of the East Bengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 (East Bengal Act No.XXVIII of 1951), Government notified for the information of all concerned, that the Governor is pleased to acquire, with effect from the 14th April 1952, all interests of the rent-receivers named in column 1 of the schedule below, in the estates and taluks and tenures, the particulars whereof are given in column 2 of the schedule, against their names, including all their interests in all sub-soil and rights to mineral in such estates and taluks and tenures and in column, the name of the plaintiff appeared and also in column 2 (a), particularly, Mirash Raja Rajendra Narayan Roy, under Sk.Tq.

Jahangir Ali and others 21 BLD 315, the case of Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and others vs. Md. Jahangir Ali and another 53 DLR (HCD) 365.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates of both sides. From the Judgment itself it appears that the plaintiff did not file a raised any objection to the application filed by the defendant-respondent-opposite party for rejection of the plaint, on the ground that it is barred by law. Before this Court, from the original application for condonation of delay the plaintiff explained the delay of 191 days in paragraphs 5 and 6, that is:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“5. That the law officer after receiving the certified copies produced the concerned file to the Manager of the Court of Wards Bhawal Raj Estate who produced proceed the file to the Chairman of the Land Reform Board, Ministry of Land Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh through the Member, Land Reform Board. The Chairman, Land Reform Board passed his orders to produce the matter before a Committee formed with some learned panel Lawyers headed by member Land management to examine and give opinion regarding filing of the appeal before the Hob’ble High Court Division.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>6. That the committee meeting held on 20.2.2008 and the matter was discussed in the meeting and it was decided that the Senior law Advisor (a retired District Judge) of the Court of Wards Bhawal Raj Estate will peruse the case record, impugned Judgment and decree, necessary documents and will to through the related laws and will give his opinion in respect of the Case. Accordingly the file was given to the Senior Law Advisor on 13.4.2008 and the Senior Law Advisor perused the record, impugned Judgment and decree and other necessary documents and opined on 23.4.2008 to prefer the appeal before the Hon’ble High Court Division.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Having been in difficulty plaintiff filed supplementary-affidavit where the plaintiff explained the delay as, after the judgment, file was produced by the Manger, Court of Wards Bhawal Raj Estate to the Member, Land Reform Board, Ministry of Land on 22.11.2007. The Member Land Reform Board after perusing the file, asked the Manager, Court of Wards to take opinion from the Senior Legal Advisor (in respect of filing of the appeal) by his order dated 26.11.2007; thereafter, the file was again sent to the Chairman, Land Reform Board Ministry of land. The Chairman approved the proposal by his order dated 26.11.2007 and the file was sent to the law Officer on 27.11.2007 and the law officer produced the file to the Senior legal advisor on 27.11.2008 and the Senior legal advisor proposed to submit the matter before the board meeting (authority) for decision; the Senior legal advisor sent the file to the law Officer on 10.12.2007. The law officer consulted about the matter with the authority and produced the file on 26.12.2007 to the Manager who produced the file on the same day to the Member, Land Reform Board, Ministry of Land, who passed his order dated 27.12.2007 to take step. Thereafter, it was proposed to produce the matter before the Land Reform Board and the proposal was approved by the Chairman, Land Reform Board, on 2.1.2008. On 7.1.2008, the law officer produced the file to the Manager, Bhawal Raj Estate, for fixing a date for holding meeting and the date was fixed on 15.1.2008. But, unfortunately, the Manager had to take leave from Office for his personal difficulties and the concern lawyer of the Bhawal Raj Estate could not appear in the meeting. On 21.1.2008, the file was produced by the law officer for fixing a date of meeting and the Chairman, Land Reform Board fixed the date for holding the meeting on 29.1.2008. Thereafter, the Member, Land Reform Board, decided to hold meeting with the learned Advocate of the land Reform Board for taking a decision in respect of dismissal of the Title Suit No.212 of 2006 and thereby, the day was fixed on 20.2.2008. Then it has been written that the authority with a view to file appeal, referred the matter to Mr. Md. Faijul Kabir, learned Advocate, who opined on 6.3.2008 that appeal can not be file against the order of rejection of the plaint of the Title Suit No.212 of 2006, on 29.10.2007. But as per decision of the authority dated 20.2.2008, appellant took step for fling appeal and accordingly, Law Officer proposed on 12.3.2008 to appoint Ms. Ferdous Akhter Wahida, learned Advocate for filing the appeal. The authority approved the proposal on 23.3.2008. Then the learned Advocate, Ms. Ferdous Akher Wahida, orally refused to receive the brief, as such, the file was produced before the Manager, Court of Wards, on 1.4.2008 for appointing a new Advocate. Manager consulted with the Member and Chairman, Land Reform Board and they referred the matter to the Senior Legal Advisor on 2.4.2008. The Senior Legal Advisor opined on 3.4.2008 to file the appeal and to take opinion from the newly appointed Senior legal advisor and the law officer proposed on 6.4.2008 to appoint Mr.Md. Abdul Haque, Advocate for filing the appeal and proposal was made to the authority to sent the file to the senior legal advisor for opinion. The proposal was approved on 10.4.2008 and the file was sent to the senior legal advisor on 13.4.2008. Senior legal advisor after perusing the record, impugned Judgment and decree and other necessary documents, opined on 23.4.2008, to prefer the appeal before the Hon’ble High Court Division.<br/><br/>The facts disclosed in the supplementary affidavit are the inherited bureaucratic methodology smeared with note-making, file pushing and passing of the back ethoes, delay on part of the appellant is less difficult to understand but more difficult to approve. The entire statements of the application for condonation of delay with supplementary affidavit reflect the appellants callousness, negligence, slothful manner and indolent attitude. <br/><br/>It appears that appeal was tendered before this Court on 27.8.2008 without second judge’s copy, which was filed on 27.8.2008. From the aforesaid narration of fact for explaining the delay in supplementary-affidavit, we do not find that, even if we consider the entire explanation given in the supplementary-affidavit as true and genuine, then we also do not find any explanation for the period from 23.4.2008 up to 27.8.2008, that is, about 4 months. This delay of 4 months has neither been sought for nor explained. It appears from the aforesaid facts that condonation of delay has been sought for in piecemeal basis. Application was filed on 27.08.2008 and supplementary affidavit was filed on 01.12.2008 which shows how much negligent and careless the petitioner was in the matter of prosecuting the appeal. In the case of <em>Bangladesh vs. Abdul Wahab and others</em> reported in 45 DLR-30 where it has been held that “petitioner having knowledge of limitation and without sufficient cause slept over the matter and allowed the period of limitation to run out and as such the delay cannot be condoned.”<br/><br/>In the case of <em>Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh Vs. Mr. Alauddin</em>, 21 BLD(AD) 35, it is observed. “It is really surprising to know that more than one year and nine months was consumed to start a part file and to file the leave petition. This is gross negligence of the part of the Solicitor wing which should not be condoned.”<br/><br/>In the case of <em>Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh Vs. Md. Jahangir Ali </em>and others, 21 DLR 315, it is held that negligence of an agent or servant of the Government is not sufficient cause to condone the delay.<br/><br/>In the case of <em>People’s Republic of Bangladesh Vs. Sri Sri Madan Gopal Jew Bigraha</em>, 53 DLR(AD)13, it has been held, while seeking condonation the Government officials concerned are to explain the delay for each day. In the application the condonation, a general explanation has been given without proper explanation for delay of each day.<br/><br/>In the case of<em> Province of East Pakistan Vs. Abdul Hamid Dargee</em>, 21 DLR 824, <em>Bangladesh Vs. Suppliers and Building Corporation</em>, 1991 BLD 194, <em>Subash Chandra Chowdhury and another Vs. Govt. of Bangladesh</em>, 46 DLR 663 and many other decisions of this sub-continent it has been held that as litigant, the Government stands on the same footing with ordinary litigants. As such delay of each date when not satisfactorily explained no one could get any premium whether he is a private individual, corporate body or government.<br/><br/>A question may arise that delay being of 191 days appellant paid court fee of more than Tk. 40,000/- and appeal is a matter of right, why the delay should not be condoned? Mr. Khalilur Rahman raises the question that after whole sale acquisition of rent receiving interest of the Zamindars by the Government, appellant lost his locus stands to initiate any case.<br/><br/>In the case of <em>Gopal Das Soni and another Vs. Government of Bangladesh</em>, 13 BLC(AD)69, it has been held, it is seen from the judgment of the High Court Division that the land in suit being the land within periphery of Khulna Hat and Bazar, compensation roll has been prepared and finally published in the gazette and that being the undisputed fact relief sought in the suit was not available to the plaintiffs so long compensation roll is not revised and the land is being shown as retainable class of land. It is also seen from the judgment of the High Court Division that compensation roll in respect of the land in suit was prepared as back as in 1962 upon assessing considerable amount of money and thereupon compensation roll has been published in the gazette. It is further seen from the judgment of the High Court Division that a sketch map has been prepared some time in 1975 by the Government in respect of the land in suit and the same has been shown within the peripehry of the Khulna Hat and Bazar. The High Court Division, on consideration of the materials on record, particularly the fact of preparation of compensation assessment roll and publication thereof in the gazette as well as the sketch map prepared in 1975 showing the land in suit within the periphery of Khulna Hat and Bazar set aside the judgment and decree of the courts below. The learned Counsel has submitted that compensation assessment roll in respect of the land of the plaintiffs and publication thereof was illegal and that publication of the said illegal assessment roll can no way take away the title of the plaintiffs in the land which is of retainable class of land and that also not within the periphery of Khulna Hat and Bazar. He has also submitted that the sketch map said to have been prepared in 1975 showing land within periphery of Khulna Hat and Bazar is an unauthorised and illegal act of the respondents and, on the basis thereof plaintiffs cannot be deprived of their tenanted land which they are legally entitled to retain. The submission of the learned Counsel as of no merit since preparation of the compensation assessment roll and the publication thereof has the legal presumption that the land claimed by the plaintiffs is of non-retainable class of land and that as on the publication of the compensation assessment roll in the gazetter, the land has vested in the Government the plaintiffs are not entitled to raise any daim in the land and as such, relief sought in the suit was not available to them. Moreover as back as in 1975 the Government prepared the sketch map showing the land in suit within the periphery of Khulna Haat and Bazar and that as it appears the said sketch map has been prepared in the background of the publication of the compensation assessment roll in the gazette the same carries legal weight in arriving at the decision as to the class of land in suit. As in the background of the materials on record the High Court Division has arrived at the finding the Courts below were in error in decreeing the suit, in our view, the finding so arrived at by the High Court Division is once in accordance with law and suffers from so infirmity are illegality.<br/><br/>In the case of <em>Promode Ranjan Shaha Vs. govt. of Bangladesh</em>, 33 DLR 53, it has been held; there are can be no denying the fact that the plaintiffs sought to challenge the acquisition of their Hat and Bazars made under the general notification dated 2.4.56 issued under section 3(1) of the East Bengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, and so it is directly hit by Presidents Order No.90 of 1972, which gives a clear mandate of law that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, on the commencement of the Order, all suits, appeals, applications and of the legal proceedings pending or continuing or deemed to be pending or continuing in any Court against the Government of the Peoples’ Republic of Bangladesh in which the legality of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act 150 (E.B. Act No. XXVIII of 1951), or of the East Bengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Amendment) Ordinance, 1956 (E.B. Ordinance No.III of 1956) or of any other law making any amendment in the said Act or of the acquisition of any property made under any provision thereof is challenged or called in question shall abate, and all orders, including orders of injunction and other interlocutory orders passed in suits, appeals, applications and other legal proceeding shall cease to have any effect: and no Courts shall entertain and no person shall brings any fresh suit, appeal, application or other legal proceedings in which the legality or validity of any such law or requisition is challenged or called in question.<br/><br/>In the case of <em>Anwara Begum Chowdhurani Vs. Nur Jahan Begum,</em> 27 DLR(AD) 109, it has been held; it appears that mention of the different classes of tenants or occupants has been made in the above quoted provisions of law. It was argued that sub-section (1) of section 24 of the Act clearly indicates that on under-raiyati holding would remain in existence at the time of the preparation of the record-of-rights which would be subsequent to the Notification under section 3 of the Act. Rule 18 provides for the preparation or revision of the record-of-rights on the basis of which the compensation Assessment-roll would be prepared and published and rule 61says that the different classes of tenancies would not cease to exist with publication of the Notification under section 3 of the Act and that entire chain of interests of rent-receivers would be eliminated only after the publication of the Compensation Assessment-roll. Thereafter a Notification would be published under sub-section (2) of section 43 declaring that the compensation assessment-roll in respect of that area had been finally published and after this publication of Notification, the whole of Part V of the Act would come into operation. The sum and substance of the contention of the learned Counsel is that raiyati interest did not cease to exist and that under-raiyat was not upgraded before Part V came into operation. With a view to strengthen his argument the learned Counsel relied on a decision in Afran Ali Sheikh’s case reported in 14 D.L.R.(Dacca)791. It is a Single Bench decision by Idris, J. of the Dacca High Court. The said case was under section 26F of the B.T. Act. In that case the question arose as to whether there was an automatic elevation of under-raiyats to the status of raiyats with effect from 14.4.56 when all rent-receiving interests vested in the Government. The learned Judge held that publication of Notification under section 3 of the Act did not eliminate the different classes of tenancies till publication of the compensation assessment-roll, i.e., till Part V of the Act came into operation. In coming to that decision Idris, J., it appears, relied on an unreported decision by Asir, J., in Civil Revision Case Nos.1129 and 1130 of 1960 of the Dacca High Court. On the authority of the decision of Idris, J. and the provisions of law referred to above, the learned Counsel submitted that pre-emption was not available in the present case to an under-raiyati even if he had occupancy right.<br/><br/>From the aforesaid discussion it appears that plaintiff has no subsisting interest in instituting the suit. The impugned Gazette notification was published under Section 3 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act with reference to particular estates, taluks, tenures, holding and tenancies and in respect of all rent receives whose properties were under the management of court of wards Act, 1878. Sub-Section (2a) was enacted and introduced in Section 3 of the Act by ordinance No.111 of 1956. It is after this amendment that general notification dated 2nd April, 1956 were issued district wise in regard to all rent receiving interest which thereafter vested in the government with effect from 14.04.56 in terms of those notification. As such, after 14.4.56 the plaintiff has no right take interest or possession in itself, whatever it has, has under the Government, not of it in any individual form to initiate any proceeding. A title less person has no legal character to initiate any proceeding as such no effective result would be available to the appellant in appeal be admitted on condonation of delay.<br/><br/>In the decision of Santannessa vs. Hapitullah Sarker, 41 DLR (AD)105 it has been held that when no useful purpose will be served in allowing the restoration of appeal and the plaintiff will be driven to fruitless litigation instead of being benefited in any manner if restoration is allowed impugned order does not call for any interference. We have already seen that plaint was rejected, as per provision of order VII rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as it is barred by law and by framing of issue as per order XIV rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the learned Judge rejected the plaintiff. Plaintiff as it appears from all the documents produced before us and produced before trial Court, that he has no title, it’s title has been eaten by the Government as per gazette notification of Monday, 24th March, 1952 published under provision of section 3 (1) of the East Bengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 (East Bengal Act No. XXVIII of 1951, as if the appeal be registered on condonation of delay, the plaintiff instead of being benefited in any manner will be driven to a fruitless litigation as it appears the defendants after getting the land from the land owners and also from Government is possessing the same for 50 years.<br/><br/>We find no reason to condone the delay.<br/><br/>In the result, the rule is discharged without any order as to costs.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

To make it clearer, a crossed cheque “account payee” must be encashed through the account of the holder in whose favour it was issued. So, by no means, a crossed cheque “account payee” looses its character as a negotiable one within the meaning of section 138 of the </strong><strong>Act of 1881. Moreover, section 13 of Act  of 1881 which has defined “Negotiable instrument” has not made any distinction between crossed cheque “account payee” or cheque of other kind such as ‘bearer cheque’ as we ordinarily mean.

The aforesaid cheque was deposited by the complainant in his Bank, AB Bank Limited, Uttara Branch, for collection from the drawee Bank, i.e. Standard Chartered Bank, Bangladesh, but the cheque was dishonoured as informed to him by a dishonour slip bearing the remark “insufficient fund”, on 11.12.2008. Thereafter, in compliance with the provisions of section 138 of the Act, 1881 the complainant sent a notice on 15.12.2008 to the accused by registered post with acknowledgement due at his abode demanding payment of the amount due under the cheque within 30(thirty) days. The said notice was received by the accused on 17.12.2008, but he did not come forward to adjust the amount due under the cheque within the stipulated period mentioned in the notice, i.e. within 17.01.2009. Hence, the complainant filed the petition of complaint on 26.01.2009. After examining the complainant under section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (the Code), the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka took cognizance in the case against the accused-petitioner under the said section of the Act, 1881. The accused petitioner surrendered before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka and obtained bail. The case being ready for trial, the record of the case was transmitted to the Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Dhaka who took cognizance in the case against the petitioner under section 138 of the Act, 1881. The case was registered as Metropolitan Sessions Case No. 2939 of 2009. Eventually, the case was transferred to the Court of Metropolitan Joint Sessions Judge, 7 Court, Dhaka for trial. The accused-petitioner appeared before the said Metropolitan Joint Sessions Judge and obtained bail.<br/><br/>The accused-petitioner filed an application in the case under section 265C of the Code on 23.06.2009 for discharging him from the case. The learned Metropolitan Joint Sessions Judge by his order dated 12.08.2009 rejected the application and then by order dated 14.08.2009 framed charge against the petitioner under section 138 of the Act, 1881. Challenging the said order of framing charge the petitioner filed a revision application before the High Court Division under section 439 read with 435 of the Code and obtained the Rule vide Criminal Revision No. 1717 of 2009.<br/><br/>A Division Bench of the High Court Division which heard the Rule by the impugned judgment and order discharged the same; hence, this petition for leave to appeal.<br/><br/>Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud, learned Advocate, appearing for the petitioner has contended that the cheque which was allegedly dishonoured being a crossed cheque “account payee”, was not a negotiable instrument within the meaning of section 123A(2)(a) of the Act, 1881, therefore, the accused-petitioner was not liable to be prosecuted within the meaning of section 138 of the Act, 1881, the High Court Division ought to have interferred with the impugned order passed by the learned Metropolitan Joint Sessions Judge framing charge against him. Mr. Mahmud has further contended that the cheque was dishonoured by the drawee Bank, namely, Standard Chartered Bank not on the ground of “insufficiency of fund” but for the dissimilarity of the signature of the accused-petitioner on the cheque and there being no dishonour slip from the said Bank in favour of the complainant, it could not be said that the offence as contemplated under section 138 of the Act, 1881 was committed by the accused-petitioner, the order passed by the Joint Metropolitan Sessions Judge, framing charge against the petitioner is liable to be set aside. Mr. Mahmud has further contended that the High Court Division fell into an error in not interfering with the order framing charge against the petitioner inasmuch as a suit being Title Suit No. 33 of 2009 filed by the accused in respect of the dishonoured cheque is pending in the 4<sup>th </sup>Court of Assistant Judge, Narayan-gonj wherein it would be decided as to whether the accused-petitioner issued the dishonoured cheque or not. He has lastly contended that at least the proceedings of the sessions case in question is required to be stayed till the decision of the said title suit, otherwise, the suit shall become infructuous<br/><br/>On the above submissions Mr. Mahmud prays for granting leave by this Court against the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division.<br/><br/>Mrs. Sufia Khatun, learned Advocate-on-Record, entering caveat on behalf of the complainant-respondent, on the other hand, supported the judgment passed by the High Court Division.<br/><br/>We have gone through the petition of complaint, the order framing charge by the learned Metropolitan Joint Sessions Judge and the judgment passed by the High Court Division.<br/><br/>From the impugned judgment it appears that the High Court Division has clearly found that the petition of complaint was filed before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka complying with all the requirements of sections 138 and 141 of the Act, 1881. The High Court Division further found that the abbreviation etc (for etcetera) used in the heading of section 138 of the Act, 1881 covers any ground or reason, whatsoever, for which a cheque is bounced, and any other interpretation would not only frustrate the legislative intent of this piece of beneficial legislation, but shall amount to deviation from the plain and clear language as well as shall give a drawer of the cheque to take undue advantage of his own act by deliberately <em>“mismatching his signature on the cheque or by making stop payment order or otherwise in order to deprive the payee.” </em>The High Court Division further found that though the Standard Bank was the drawee Bank, the cheque in question having been deposited by the payee with his banker, A.B. Bank Limited, Uttara Branch, for collection, either because the cheque was a crossed cheque or the payee deposited the cheque after crossing it and the cheque having been returned as unpaid, the offence under section 138 of the Act, 1881 was committed. The High Court Division further found that the complainant was not “supposed” to receive the information about the letter dated 30.08.2009 issued by an officer of the drawee bank to its customer, the accused-petitioner to the effect that the signature of the drawer did not match with “the signature made on the cheque” and the same has no relevance to issue a demand notice under clause (b) of section 138(1) of the Act, 1881.<br/><br/>Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud does not dispute the finding given by the High Court Division that the petition of complaint giving rise to the sessions case in question was filed complying with all the requirements as required by sections 138 and 141 of the Act, 1881, so in view of the findings given by the High Court Division and the submissions made by the learned Advocates for the respective parties, the questions to be decided in the petition for leave to appeal are (i) whether the dishonoured cheque being a crossed cheque “account payee” returned to the bank of the payee A.B. Bank unpaid with the endorsement “insufficiency of fund” would attract the mischief of section 138 of the Act, 1881 (ii) whether the letter issued by the drawee bank on 30.08.2009 to the accused-petitioner to the effect that the signature of the drawer did not match with the signature “made on the cheque” can be taken into consideration in deciding the merit of a revision application preferred by the petitioner against the order framing charge under section 138 of the Act, 1881 (iii) whether a pending civil suit in respect of the dishonoured cheque can be used as a shield by the accused for his protection from being prosecuted in respect of an offence committed under section 138 of the Act, 1881.<br/><br/>Cheque has been defined in section 6 of the Act, 1881 as a bill of exchange drawn on a specified banker and not expressed to be payable otherwise than on demand. In section 6 nothing has been said about crossed cheque or an account payee cheque. We get the idea of crossed cheque or “account payee” cheque in section 123 and 123A of the Act, 1881. The said two sections read as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong>123.</strong> <strong>Cheque cross generally</strong><strong> – </strong>Where a cheque bears a cross across its face an addition of the words “and company” or any abbreviation thereof, between two parallel transverse lines, or of two paralleled transverse lines simply, either with or without the words “not negotiable”, that addition shall be deemed a crossing and the cheque shall be deemed to be crossed generally.<br/><br/><strong>123A. Cheque cross “account payee” </strong><strong>– </strong>(1) Where a cheque crossed generally bears across its face an addition of the words “account payee” between the two parallel transverse lines constituting the general cross-ing, the cheque, besides being crossed generally, is said to be crossed “account payee.”<br/>(2) When a cheque is crossed “account payee”–<br/>(a)    it shall cease to be negotiable; and<br/>(b)    it shall be the duty of the banker collecting payment of the cheque to credit the proceeds thereof only to the account of the payee named in the cheque.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From clause (a) of sub-section (2) of section 123A it appears that when a cheque is crossed “account payee” it ceases to be negotiable. Now we are to see what is the legal implication of these words “shall cease to be negotiable”; to answer this question effectively and squarely, we are to see the provisions of section 138 of the Act, 1881. The admitted position being that the petition of complaint was filed complying with the requirements of section 138 of the Act as spelt out in the proviso to sub-section (1) and the other sub-sections thereto, we are not required to consider those provisions but we are to consider the heading of section 138 as well as sub-section (1) without the proviso which read as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong>138. Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc. of funds in the account</strong><strong>– </strong>(1). Where any cheque drawn by a person on an account maintained by him with a banker for payment of any amount of money to another person from out of that account is returned by the bank unpaid, either because of the amount of money standing to the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the cheque or that it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement made with that bank, such person shall be deemed to have committed an offence and shall, without prejudice to any other provisions of this Act, be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine which may extend to thrice the amount of the cheque, or with both:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From a mere reading of sub-section (1) of section 138 of the Act it is apparent that the legislature has consciously used the word any ‘cheque’ drawn by a person on an account maintained by him with a banker for payment of any amount of money to another person from out of that account. Legislature very well knew about section 123A of the Act. Had it been the intention of the legislature to exclude a crossed cheque “account payee” as used in clause (a) of sub-section (2) of section 123A from the mischief of sections 138 and 141 of the Act, 1881, then they would have definitely mentioned cheque other than ‘crossed cheque’. It appears to us that the moment a cheque is dishonoured, either a bearer cheque or crossed cheque “account payee”, for any reason whatsoever including the alleged dissimilarity of the signature of the drawer on the cheque as found by the High Court Division while interpreting the meaning of the abbreviation “etc.” used in the heading of section 138, the offence under the section shall be complete and in that case the payee shall have the liberty to file a petition of complaint before the competent Magistrate against the drawer of the cheque, of course, by complying with the proviso to sub-section (1) of section 138. And in the instant case admittedly those requirements were clearly complied with before filing the case. The legislative mandate as used in clause (a) of sub-section (2) of section 123A of the Act, 1881 that when a cheque is crossed “account payee” shall cease to be negotiable means it cannot be negotiated or encashed with any other person except the person in whose favour the same was issued. To make it clearer, a crossed cheque “account payee” must be encashed through the account of the holder in whose favour it was issued. So, by no means, a crossed cheque “account payee” looses its character as a negotiable one within the meaning of section 138 of the Act, 1881. Moreover, section 13 of Act, 1881 which has defined “Negotiable instrument” has not made any distinction between crossed cheque “account payee” or cheque of other kind such as ‘bearer cheque’ as we ordinarily mean. Thus, we find that section 123A of the Act, 1881, in no way, creates any bar in proceeding with a case under section 138 of the Act, 1881. In other words, we do not see any nexus of section 123A with the proceedings to be initiated under section 138 of the Act. If the interpretation of Mr. Mahmud about clause (a) of sub-section (2) of section 123A of the Act, is accepted then the whole purpose of bringing into book of the defaulting drawer of the cheque shall be frustrated; accordingly, we reject his contention on the point. So, we find nothing wrong with the order of the learned Joint Metropolitan Sessions Judge in framing charge against the petitioner under section 138 of the Act, 1881.<br/> <br/>The contention of Mr. Rokunuddin Mahmud that the cheque in the instant case was not dishonoured by the drawee bank because of the “insufficiency of fund” but because of the dissimilarity of the signature of the drawer on the cheque as apparent from annexure-X to the revision application, therefore, by such dishonourment no offence was committed by the accused has got no substance. It is the common banking practice that the holder of an account payee cheque deposits the cheque with his banker for collection of the amount of the cheque from the drawee bank through the clearing house. And in the instant case the said procedure was followed by the complainant as he deposited the cheque in question with his banker A.B. Bank Limited, Uttara Branch for collection of the amount of the cheque. The cheque was returned unpaid to his banker which gave the dishonour slip to him on 10.12.2008 with the endorsement for “insufficient fund” and thus, the complainant had the definite information about return of the cheque as contemplated in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 138 of the Act, 1881 and accordingly, he issued the notice asking the drawer to pay the money of the cheque. As per, the mandate of clause (b) of the proviso to section 138(1) the complainant was not at all required to wait for any information from the drawee bank in respect of the dishonoured cheque. Moreover, the letter by the drawee bank having been issued on 30.08.2009 to the accused-petitioner, that is, after about 8(eight) months from the presentation of the cheque to the effect that the signature of the drawer “does not match with the signature of the drawer made on the cheque” cannot be a ground to absolve the accused-petitioner from the mischief of section 138 of the Act, 1881, particularly when charge in the case had already been framed on 14.08.2009. We also do not see any rationale in the submission of Mr. Mahmud in this regard, as the complainant was not supposed to have received such information from the drawee bank. Whether the cheque in question was dishonoured for the “insufficiency of fund” or for the “dissimilarity of the signature of the drawer on the cheque” as stated in the letter dated 30.08.2009 is a question of fact which can only be thrashed out during the trial. We do not see any scope of deciding such question in considering the merit of the revision application.<br/> <br/>So far as the last question is concerned, we are of the view that the operation of section 138 of the Act, 1881 cannot be obstructed or, in any way, circumvented by the mere fact of filing of a suit by the drawer of the dishonoured cheque in civil Court whatever allegations may be in the plaint about the same and the relief prayed for therein, because such a device shall totally make the section itself nugatory. However, if a holder or the payee gets hold of a dishonoured cheque by fraudulent means or forgery, the drawer of the cheque shall have the liberty to take such defence during the trial.<br/> <br/>For the discussions made above, all the 3(three) questions as formulated hereinbefore are answered in the negative, consequently we find no reason to interfere with the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, this petition is dismissed. <br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Akram Hossain Chowdhury, J:</u></strong></span><br/><br/>The appeal is directed against the order dated 19.01.2009 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court and Special Tribunal No. 6, Kushtia, in Special Tribunal Case No. 23 of 2008 arising out of Kushtia Sadar Police Station Case No. 18 dated 18.11.2007 corresponding to G.R. No. 303 of 2007, framing charge against the appellants under Section 25(1) of the Special Powers Act, 1974.<br/><br/>The prosecution case in short is that one Md. Rejaul karim, Sub-Inspector of Police, Detective Branch, Kushtia being informant lodged an FIR with Kushtia Sadar Police Station implicating the present appellants and six others as accused stating <em>inter-alia </em>that <em>on</em> the basis of secret message he, upon making entry of a General Diary (G.D.) being No.90 dated 18.11.2007, with his force went to Mojompur area to apprehend the terrorists and for recovery of narcotics from there. Then they got an information from a secret source that some accused persons might carry fertilizer for smuggling or black marketing by a truck. While they reached at the petrol pump of one Mojaffar at Mojompur out of suspicion they made signal to stop a truck being number Jessore Da-11-0588. At that time the passengers of the Truck accused Joni and Nayan took steps to flee away; the informant’s accompanied forces caught hold the accused Joni and Nayan on the spot and another accused namely Nazrul managed to flee away from the place of occurrence. The informant and his forces upon searching the truck in presence of the witnesses recovered 60 bags of M.O.P fertilizer and 120 bags of T.S.P fertilizer. On interrogation the accused persons disclosed the names of other accused Nazrul, Jamiruddin, Sagor, Jhontu, Laltu and shajahan. Thereafter preparing a seizure list in presence of witnesses the informant lodged the FIR. Upon which Kushtia Sadar Police Station case No. 18 dated 18.11.2007 corresponding to G.R. No. 303 of 2007 under Section 25(1) of the Special Powers Act, 1974 was started against the accused appellants and others.<br/>The police after holding investigation in to the case submitted charge sheet being No.282 dated 16.12.2007 against the six accused persons including the present appellants under the aforesaid Provisions of Law. Eventually the case was transferred to the Court of Special Tribunal No. 6, Kushtia for trial and the same was registered as Special Tribunal case No. 23 of 2008.<br/><br/>The learned Judge of the Special Tribunal No. 6, Kushtia upon hearing the parties, by his Order dated 19.01.2009, framed charge against accused appellants and others under Section 25(1) of the Special Powers Act, 1974.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the said order of framing charge dated 19.01.2009 the present accused appellants preferred this appeal under Section 30 of the Special Powers Act, 1974.<br/><br/>Mr. Zulfiquer Motin, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants submitted that the appellants are the bonafide businessman by profession and they deal with fertilizer business at Vatoibazar under Jhena-idah District. The appellants have the license and other legal documents for the same business. They have been falsely implicated with the case though they have not committed the alleged offence. He further submitted that though the accused appellants had filed their legal documents with their application under Section 265C of the Code of Criminal Procedure but the learned Judge of the Tribunal without considering the said documents and assigning any cogent reason therein rejecting the said application framed charge against the appellants. The learned Advocate of the appellants further submitted that there is no ingredients of Section 25(1) of the Special Powers Act, 1974 against the appellants to implicate them in the case for committing such offence. His further submission was that the alleged fertilizer have been seized at Mojompur bus stand which is situated under the District of Kushtia, whereas the accused appellants are living and deal with their business at Vatoibazar in Jhenaidah District and at the time of occurrence of the case nothing has been recovered from the house or business place of the appellants. As such, the impugned order of charge as framed against them is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>Mr. Motin finally placing before us the “সার (ব্যবস্থাপনা) আইন-২০০৬” submitted that though the appellants were not involved with the alleged occurrence of black marketing of fertilizer or smuggling but the alleged offence may attract within the purview of the “সার (ব্যবস্থাপনা) আইন, ২০০৬”. According to the “সার (ব্যবস্থাপনা) আইন-২০০৬” the alleged offence is triable by the 1<sup>st</sup> Class Magistrate and not by the Special Tribunal under the Special Powers Act, 1974. The learned Judge of the Tribunal without appreciating the said provisions of law framed charge against the accused appellants by the impugned order which is to be interfered with by this Hon’ble Court and the same is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>Mr. Gazi Md. Mamunur Rashid, the learned Assistant Attorney General though opposes the said submission of the appellants but he find difficulties to rebut the submission of the learned Advocate of the appellants with regards to that the offence as alleged attracted within the purview of “সার (ব্যবস্থাপনা) আইন-২০০৬” and its trial should have to be held by the Magistrate, 1<sup>st</sup> class under the said provisions of law and not by the Tribunal under the Special Act, 1974.<br/><br/>Heard the learned Advocates, perused the FIR, Charge Sheet and other materials on record. We have gone through the impugned order as well as the “সার (ব্যবস্থাপনা) আইন-২০০৬” for proper disposal of the appeal. It appears from the record that the offence as alleged in the case for hoarding and transporting the fertilizer for the purpose of black marketing has been committed by the accused persons including the present appellants and upon which the case was initiated against them under Section 25(1) of the Special Powers Act, 1974. But while the “সার (ব্যবস্থাপনা) আইন-২০০৬” has been promulgated by the Government for protection and proper management of the fertilizer and also to impose punishment to the offender for such offence like the offence narrated in the instant FIR and charge sheet, its proceedings should have to be proceed under the said Ain and not under the Special Powers Act. After promulgation of the said Ain such offence should not come within the purview of any other law other than the “সার (ব্যবসহাপনা) আইন-২০০৬”. In the “সার (ব্যবস্থাপনা) আইন, ২০০৬” there are some specific sections provided for such offence like unlawful hoarding, carrying and producing of fertilizer and those offence are punishable under Section 12/17 of the said Ain and the trial of such offences as provided therein to be held by a Magistrate, 1<sup>st</sup> class under Section 21 of সার (ব্যবস্থাপনা) আইন, ২০০৬। Since the Government promulgated the Specific Law for protection and proper management of fertilizer, after which trial of such offence should not be held under any law other than the “সার (ব্যবস্থাপনা) আইন, ২০০৬”।<br/><br/>Apart from this the offences as described under the সার (ব্যবস্থাপনা) আইন, ২০০৬ are not the scheduled offence to the Special Powers Act, 1974 and on that regard we find support in the case of Abdur Rahman and others =Vs= The state, reported in 19 BLD (AD)-4, wherein our apex court held that- “The Special Tribunal had only Jurisdiction to try cases as enumerated in the schedule of Special Powers Act and not beyond that”.<br/><br/>Having considered the facts and circumstances of the case and discussion made herein above it appears to us that the offence as described in the FIR and charge sheet has fallen within the purview of  “সার (ব্যবস্থাপনা) আইন, ২০০৬”. Thus, we are inclined to dispose of the appeal upon setting aside the impugned order, as it was passed without jurisdiction, with an observation that since the alleged offence as enunciated has fallen within the purview of the “সার (ব্যবস্থাপনা) আইন, ২০০৬” the trial of the instant case should have to be held in accordance with Section 21 of the said Ain not beyond that.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the appeal is disposed of with the above observation. The impugned order dated 19.01.2009 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court and Special Tribunal No. 6, Kushtia, in Special Tribunal Case No. 23 of 2008 is hereby set aside and the learned Judge of the Tribunal is directed to take necessary steps to send the case to the appropriate Court for holding the trial of the case in accordance with the “সার (ব্যবস্থাপনা) আইন, ২০০৬”।<br/><br/>Communicate the judgment and order to the Court concerned at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Mafizul Haque as complainant filed a petition of complaint in the Court of  Magistr-ate, first Class, Sherpur alleging that on 02-03-2001 his daughter Nurjahan was married with accused No. 1 Md. Samidul. During their wed-lock one female child born. Since marriage all the accused conjointly used to torture her for the cause of dowry. Later, the accused drove her with child for bringing Tk. 40,000/- as dowry. Then the complainant again kept her in her conjugal house. Subsequently it was informed that one day after occurrence victim Nurjahan was missing and her whereabout was not known to the accused. The complaint was referred to local P.S. wherein it was recorded as Nalitabari Police Station Case No. 05 dated 10-05-2003 corresponding to G.R. No. 355 of 2003.<br/><br/>The Police after investigation on 22-07-2003 submitted final report in favour of all the accused and recommended to prosecute the complainant under Section 17 of the Ain, 2000 for bringing false allegations.<br/><br/>The learned Magistrate, ultimately referred the case record to the Tribunal, wherein the learned Judge by the order dated 11-04-2004 took cognizance of the offence under Section 11(Ga)/30 of the Ain, 2000 against the accused Samidul, Lichu Khatun and Mala Khatun and accepted the Police report in respect of the rest accused however, recomm-endation to prosecute under Section 17 of the Ain was refused.<br/><br/>Eventually, the learned Judge framed charge against the aforesaid three accused under Sections 11(Ga), 11(Ga)/30 of the Ain, 2000 by the impugned order.<br/><br/>Feeling aggrieved the appellants preferred the instant appeal.<br/><br/>No one appears to support the appeal. In view of the facts this is an old appeal of 2004. We are inclined to take it up for disposal on merit considering the materials on record.<br/><br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the respondent opposes the appeal and submits that the learned Judge of the Court below after considering the materials on record rightly framed charge which calls for no interference by this Court.<br/><br/>In order to appreciate his submission we have gone through the record and given our anxious consideration to his submissions.<br/><br/>On going to the materials on record it transpires that the informant in his complaint made allegations that the accused persons conjointly demanded dowry to his daughter Nurjahan. On meticulous examination of the complaint we failed to discover that for the cause of such demanding of dowry the accused persons caused any hurt to her.<br/><br/>For the convenience of understanding the provisions of Section 11(Ga) of the Ain, 2000 reads as hereunder:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong>১১। যৌতুকের জন্য মৃত্যু ঘটানোর, ইত্যাদির শাস্তি।-</strong> যদি কোন নারীর স্বামী অথবা স্বামীর পিতা, মাতা, অভিভাবক, আত্মীয় বা স্বামীর পক্ষে অন্য কোন ব্যক্তি যৌতুকের জন্য উক্ত নারীর মৃত্যু ঘটান বা মৃত্যু ঘটানোর চেষ্টা করেন, কিংবা উক্ত নারীকে মারাত্মক জখম (grievous hurt) করেন বা সাধারণ জখম (simple hurt) করেন। তাহা হইলে উক্ত স্বামী, স্বামীর পিতা, মাতা, অভিভাবক, আত্মীয় বা ব্যাক্তি-<br/>ক) ---------------------------<br/>খ) ---------------------------<br/>গ) সাধারণ জখম (simple hurt) করার জন্য অনধিক তিন বৎসর কিন্তু অন্যুন এক বৎসর সশ্রম কারাদন্ডে দন্ডনীয় হইবেন এবং উক্ত দন্ডের অতিরিক্ত অর্থ দন্ডেও দন্ডনীয় হইবেন।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Moreso, we find that there is vague and unspecific allegation of torture, mental or physical torture and causing hurt- or injury are not the same act. The allegation of torture does not mean causing hurt. Thus the vague and unspecific allegation of torture made in the first information report/complaint does not attract an offence under Sections 11(M), 11(M)/30 of the Ain 2000. Therefore, we hold that the learned Judge of the Court below “without considering the materials on record erroneously framed charge against the appellants which cannot be sustained in the eye of law. Thus the appeal having merit succeeds.<br/> <br/>In view of foregoing narrative, the appeal is allowed.<br/> <br/>The appellants are discharged from the charge leveled against them.<br/> <br/>The office is directed to communicate the order at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

They also found accused Nurul Kabir running away towards north. Later on P.Ws. 6 and 9 happened at the scene they also found the accused Nurul Kabir running away and heard that the accused Nurul Kabir inflicted gun-fire upon deceased Syed Karim. So the evidence of all the above prosecution witnesses in respect of hearing the verbal dying declaration of the deceased and running away the accused Nurul Kabir are consistent, uniform and corroborative with material particulars. So the same are invulnerable to the credibility....(65)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Criminal Trial </strong><br/><strong>It is true that the case was investigated twice by the two investigating officers so obviously the examination of the witnesses will occur in two different occasions. So the same will not prejudice the accused in any manner. Furthermore there are some minor discrepancies in respect of circumstantial facts which can not be denoted as contradictions and affected the merit of the case. With that regard we must bear in mind that the discrepancies have to be distinguished from the contradictions whereas contradictions in the statements of witnesses may be fatal for the prosecution but minor discrepancies in evidence will not make the prosecution case doubtful where the discrepancies are of minor character and do not go to the root of the prosecution story and do not shake the basic version of the witnesses, they need not be given much more importance and their testimony should not be jettisoned....(66)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Criminal Trial</strong><br/><strong>It appears that the defence unsuccessfully tried to make out the case that blood stained earth was not seized at the relevant time but it is in the evidence that it was diminished by walking and I.O. did not find it at or about the time of occurrence. Moreover the learned Counsel repeatedly urged that the gun fire was inflicted from the back but the post-mortem report does not support the same. So, we are unable to accept it. Therefore, we find the complicity of the accused Nurul Kabir with crime of murder is well proved and the Court below rightly and legally convicted him....(67)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)</strong><br/><strong>Section 376</strong><br/><strong>The condemned-prisoner was aged about 28 years when he was examined under Section 342 Cr.P.C. The record indicates that the condemned prisoner is not a hard criminal, he cannot be at all characterized to be a menace to the society. Taking an account of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, ends of justice will be met if death sentence is altered to one of imprisonment for life. Condemned prisoner Nurul Kabir, thus stands sentenced to imprisonment for life. ...(68)</strong><br/><br/><em>Sanwar Hossain Vs.

Ziaul Karim, J:</u></strong></span><br/><br/>This Death Reference under Section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been made by the learned Judge of Divisional Druto Bichar Tribunal, Chittagong (briefly as Tribunal) for confirmation of death sentence of condemned-prisoner.<br/><br/>By the Criminal appeal no. 3778 of 2009 and Jail Appeal No. 1055 of 2005 the convict-appellant has challenged the legality and propriety of the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 30-08-2005 passed by learned Judge of Tribunal, in Druto Bichar Case no. 10 of 2005 convicting the appellant under Section 302 of the Penal Code and sentencing him to death by hanging. By the same judgment the learned Judge acquitted the other co-accused Manjur Alam alias Manju from the charge.  Against which the informant as appellant preferred Criminal appeal no. 4347 of 2005.<br/><br/>The Death Reference and all these appeals having arisen out of the common judgment, these have been heard together and are being disposed of by this judgment.<br/><br/>The prosecution case put in a nutshell are that on 15-12-2001 at 9.15 p.m. Jahir Ahmed (P.W.1) and his manager of salt crashing factory Mr. Jaker Ahmed (P.W.7) were discussing about business affairs at his house. At that time his brother Syed Karim alias Latkaia (since deceased) was passing towards east through the courtyard by motor cycle (briefly as P.O.). Having had heard the gun fire and screaming of his brother, he along with Jaker Ahmed(P.W.7), father Haji Abdul Karim Sikder(P.W.3), mother Rowshan Ara Begum alias Rowshan (P.W.2), brother Muslem and deceased’s wife Most. Joinab Begum(P.W.4) rushed to the scene to whom the victim disclosed that Nurul Kabir son of Haji Siddique Ahmed of village Maddya Napitkhali, inflicted gun fire to him(victim) and ran away. They also witnessed the assailant Nurul Kabir retreating and identified him by the electric light. They carried the victim to Malumghat Christian hospital wherein the attending doctor declared him dead. After occurrence the locals namely Shah Alam, Md. Hefajat Ulla (P.W. 5), Shahabuddin (P.W. 10), Faridul Alam (P.W. 6), Jafer Ahmed(P.W.9) happened at the scene who also disclosed that prior to occurrence accused Monjur Alam was roaming around the P.O. and they found accused Nurul Kabir running away. The reasons behind such murder might be the sequel to the conflict between the deceased and accused Monjur Alam over non-payment of borrowed money by later who later on managed to commit murder by accused Nurul Kabir. The prosecution was launched by lodging a first information report (briefly as F.I.R.) by the elder brother of deceased Jahir Ahmed as informant which was recorded as Cox’s Bazar Police Station Case no. 12(12)2001 corresponding to G.R. no. 444 of 2001.<br/><br/>The Police after investigation submitted charge sheet under Sections 302, 109 of the Penal Code accusing two accused namely Nurul Kabir and Monjur Alam.<br/><br/>Eventually the accused were called upon to answer the charge under Sections 302, 34 of the Penal Code to which the accused on dock pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/><br/>In course of trial the prosecution in all, produced 15 witnesses, of them examined 14 witnesses and P.W. 3 was tendered  by the prosecution and defence declined to cross-examine him.<br/><br/>After closure of the prosecution case the accused were examined under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure again they repeated their innocence and led no evidence in defence.<br/><br/>The defence case as it appears from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses are that of innocence and false implication. It is divulged in defence that the deceased have been killed by unknown assailants but due to previous internal feud they were falsely implicated out of vengence by their local rivals.<br/><br/>After trial the learned Judge of the Court below convicted the accused as aforesaid.<br/><br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General  appearing for the State supports the reference and submits that the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence based on evidence on record. He adds that the deceased Syed Karim made a verbal dying declaration narrating the complicity of accused Nurul Kabir and the same was corroborated by the witnesses who also found that accused Nurul Kabir was retreating. He further submits that the injuries received by the victim were corroborated with the injuries shown in the inquest report. Therefore the conviction and sentence calls for no interference by this Court.<br/><br/>The learned Counsels appearing for the condemned prisoner by their common contentions seek to impeach the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence on the four fold arguments:<br/><br/><u><strong>Firstly:</strong></u> Prima-facie it appears that the victim received the gun–shot injury at the back, so it was impossible for him to identify the assailants and according to him recognition was absolutely doubtful.<br/><br/><u><strong>Secondly:</strong></u> Most of the witnesses categorically stated that at the time of occurrence blood of the deceased fell down but the investigating officer (briefly as I.O.) failed to seize blood stained earth from the P.O. which cast a serious doubt upon the manner of occurrence.<br/><br/><u><strong>Thirdly: </strong></u>Some of the witnesses were examined by the I.O. after long time. So their evidence cannot be relied in convicting the accused.<br/><br/>In support of their contentions, the learned Counsels refer the case of Sanwar Hossain Vs. State 45 DLR 489 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Inordinate delay in examining impo-rtant prosecution witnesses casts a serious doubt as to the truth of the prosecution case and in such circums-tances their evidence is to be left out of consideration.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><u><strong>Fourthly:</strong></u> The defence even if fails to establish his case but the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.<br/><br/>In support of their contentions they refer the case of Shadat Ali and another Vs. State 44 DLR 217 held: </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“ Even if the defence fails to establish its case that will not make the prosecution case proved as the burden of proof on the prosecution never shifts.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The learned Counsels lastly submit that there are material contradictions between the testimony of the alleged eye witnesses. So it is very unsafe to rely on it. So the conviction and sentence cannot be sustained in the eye of law.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate appearing for the informant-appellant submits that the most of the local witnesses categorically stated about the complicity of accused Monjur Alam in this case. He adds that there was long standing business transactions between him and deceased who conspired the whole crime and abated accused Nurul Kabir and there is no mismatch or distinction between the convict and acquitted accused but the Court below without considering the evidence on record acquitted the accused Manjur Alam causing miscarriage of justice.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate appearing for the respondent no.2, Manjur Alam submits that there is no evidence in respect of abating the accused Nurul Kabir by accused Manjur Alam and the prosecution measurably failed to make a nexus between him and crime of murder. The Court below rightly considered the insufficient evidence and acquitted him which calls for no interference by this Court.<br/><br/>In order to appreciate their submissions we have gone through the record and given our anxious considerations to their submissions.<br/><br/>It is indisputable that slain Syed Karim was lynched by receiving gun shot injuries.<br/><br/>Now the question calls for consideration, is, whether the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence can be sustained in the eye of law.<br/><br/>Let us now weigh and sift the evidence on record adduced by the prosecution to prove the charge.<br/><br/>P.W.1, Jahir Ahmed is the informant and elder brother of deceased Syed Karim. He deposed that on 15-12-2001 at 9.00 p.m. he along with his Manager Zaker Ahamed was discussing about business.

LJ 1122);</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Normally the Court in order to satisfy whether the deceased was in a fit mental condition to make the dying declaration look up to the medical opinion.

Madan Mohan A 1989, SC 1519: 1989 Cri LJ 1485).</em></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Dying declaration if found acceptable alone can form the foundation for a conviction. The General rule is that all oral evidence must be direct viz, if it refers to a fact which could be seen it must be the evidence of the witness who says he saw it; if it refers to a fact which could be heard, it must be the evidence of the witness who says he heard it, if it refers to a fact which could be perceived by any other sense, it must be the evidence of the witness who says he perceived it by that sense. Similar is the case with opinion. These aspects are elaborated in S. 60. The eight clauses of S.32 are exceptions to the general rule against hearsay just stated. Clause (1) of Section 32 makes relevant what is generally described as dying declaration, though such an expression has not been used in any statute. It essentially means statements made by a person as to the cause of his death or as to the circumstances of the transaction resulting in his death. The grounds of admission are: firstly, necessity for the victim being generally the only principal eye-witness to the crime, the exclusion of the statement might defeat the ends of justice and, secondly, the sense of impending death, which creates a sanction equal to the obligation of an oath. The general principle on which this species of evidence is admitted is that they are declarations made in extremity, when the party is at the point of death and when every hope of this world is gone, when every motive to falsehood is silenced, and the mind is induced by the most powerful considerations to speak the truth; a situation so solemn and so lawful is considered by the law as creating an obligation equal to that which is imposed by a positive oath administered in a Court of justice. These aspects have been eloquently stated by Eyre L CR in R.V. Wood Cock(1789) 1 Leach 500.<br/> <br/>The situation in which a man is on death bed is so solemn and screen when he is dying that the grave position in which he is placed, is the reason in law to accept inveracity of his statement. It is for this reason the requirements of oath and cross-examination are dispensed with. Besides, should the dying declaration be excluded it will result in miscarriage of justice  because the victim being generally the only eye witnesses in a serious crime, the exclusion of the statement would leave the Court without a scrap of evidence.<br/> <br/>Though a dying declaration is entitled to a great weight, it is worthwhile to note that the accused has no power of cross-examination. Such a power is essential for eliciting the truth as an obligation of oath could be. This is the reason the Court also insists that the dying declaration should be of such a nature as to inspire full confidence of the Court in its correctness. The Court has to be on guard that the statement of deceased was not as a result of either tutoring, or prompting or a product of imagination. The Court must be further satisfied that the deceased was in a fit state of mind after a clear opportunity to observe and identify the assailants. Once the Court is satisfied that the declaration was true and voluntary, undoubtedly, it can base its conviction without any further corroboration. It cannot be laid down as an absolute rule of law that the dying declaration cannot form the sole basis of conviction unless it is corroborated. The rule requiring corrobor-ation is merely a rule of prudence.<br/> <br/>Dying declaration if found acceptable alone can form the foundation for a conviction. The rule requiring corroboration is merely a rule of prudence.<br/><br/>In the case of Salim(Md.) V. State 54 DLR -359 held :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The dying declaration of victim has not been reduced to writing, yet when it has been proved by overwh-elmming ocular evidence to prove the guilt of accused-appellant, the dying declaration of victim itself stands out as a strong piece of evidence proving the guilt of the appellant.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>P.W.1, brother of the deceased, having had heard the gun-fire and screaming of the deceased rushed to the P.O. along with others namely P.Ws.2, 4 and 7, to whom the victim Syed Karim stated that accused Nurul Kabir inflicted gun fire and running away. They also found accused Nurul Kabir running away towards north. Later on P.Ws. 6 and 9 happened at the scene they also found the accused Nurul Kabir running away and heard that the accused Nurul Kabir inflicted gun-fire upon deceased Syed Karim. So the evidence of all the above prosecution witnesses in respect of hearing the verbal dying declaration of the deceased and running away the accused Nurul Kabir are consistent, uniform and corroborative with material particulars. There is absolutely no reason to disbelieve the consistent and corroborative evidence of those competent witnesses, having no reason whatsoever to depose falsely against the condemned-prisoner. The defence extensively cross-examined them but nothing could be elicited to shake their credibility in any manner whatsoever. So the same are invulnerable to the credibility.<br/>It is true that the case was investigated twice by the two investigating officers so obviously the examination of the witnesses will occur in two different occasions. So the same will not prejudice the accused in any manner. Furthermore there are some minor discrepa-ncies in respect of circumstantial facts which can not be denoted as contradictions and affe-cted the merit of the case. With that regard we must bear in mind that the discrepancies have to be distinguished from the contradict-ions whereas contradictions in the statements of witnesses may be fatal for the prosecution but minor discrepancies in evidence will not make the prosecution case doubtful where the discrepancies are of minor character and do not go to the root of the prosecution story and do not shake the basic version of the witnesses, they need not be given much more importance and their testimony should not be jettisoned.<br/><br/>It appears that the defence unsuccessfully tried to make out the case that blood stained earth was not seized at the relevant time but it is in the evidence that it was diminished by walking and I.O. did not find it at or about the time of occurrence. Moreover the learned Counsel repeatedly urged that the gun fire was inflicted from the back but the post-mortem report does not support the same. So, we are unable to accept it. Therefore, we find the complicity of the accused Nurul Kabir with crime of murder is well proved and the Court below rightly and legally convicted him.<br/><br/>Moreover the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence in its entirety is well founded in the facts and circumstances of the case. So the grounds urged and contentions advanced by the learned Counsel for the condemned prisoner are not the correct exposition of law. However, the condemned-prisoner was aged about 28 years when he was examined under Section 342 Cr.P.C. The record indicates that the condemned prisoner is not a hard criminal, he cannot be at all characterised to be a menace to the society. Taking an account of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, ends of justice will be met if death sentence is altered to one of imprisonment for life. Condemned prisoner Nurul Kabir, thus stands sentenced to imprisonment for life.<br/><br/>In the light of discussions made above we find no evidence against Monjur Alam for abating accused Nurul Kabir to commit murder of deceased Syed Karim. Most of the witnesses merely stated that the accused Monjur Alam was roaming around the place of occurrence for certain moment but the deceased Syed Karim himself did not disclose such fact to his inmates and other neighbouring witnesses. So we failed to discover any merit in Criminal appeal no. 4347 of 2005.<br/><br/>In the result the reference is rejected with a modification of sentence to the above terms;<br/><br/>The Criminal appeal no. 3778 of 2009 and Jail appeal no. 1055 of 2005 are allowed in part with a modification to the effect that the condemned prisoner Nurul Kabir is convicted under Section 302 of the Penal Code and sentenced to suffer imprisonment for life.<br/><br/>In view of the provisions laid down in Section 35A(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure the total period the condemned prisoner have been in the custody before conviction in connection with this offence shall be deducted from the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to him.<br/><br/>Criminal appeal no. 4347 of 2005 is dismissed.<br/><br/>The office is directed to send down the records at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

But the defendants sold out more lands than their shares and have been continuing to sell further lands. They sold properties to different persons on different occasions by more than 50 deeds of sale. The plaintiffs being poor could collect certified copies of four such deeds of sale only. The defendants  threatened the labourers of the plaintiffs, who had been ploughing the land of the plaintiffs. Under the circumstance it is necessary to appoint a receiver in respect of the suit land just to save the suit land from wastage and selling.<br/> <br/>The learned Joint District Judge, First Court, Dinajpur allowed the application appointing a receiver in Partition Suit No. 250 of 1982 by his order dated 02.11.2002.<br/> <br/>After that, defendant Nos. 1 to 6 and defendant Nos. 12-23 preferred two appeals being Miscellaneous Appeal Nos. 85 of 2002 and 79 of 2002 respectively before the Special District Judge, Dinajpur who heard and allowed both the appeals analogously by his single judgment and order dated 15.06.2006. <br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the  judgment and order dated 15.06.2006 passed by the learned Special District Judge, Dinajpur the plaintiffs preferred two revisional applications before the High Court Division under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Proced-ure and obtained Rules in Civil Revision Nos. 3492 and 3650 of 2006. <br/> <br/>The High Court Division made both the Rules absolute reversing the judgment and order passed by the learned Special District Judge and restoring the order passed by the learned Joint District Judge by the judgment and order dated 06.12.2009.<br/> <br/>Feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division, the defendants-petitioners have filed both the appeals.<br/> <br/>Dr. M. Zahir, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the petitioners in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.94 of 2010 submits that as a general rule, a receiver is not appointed in a suit for partition and that existence of dispute cannot be a ground for appointing a receiver and that the High Court Division without taking into consideration those broad principles set aside the judgment delivered by the appellate Court restoring the order passed by the learned Joint District Judge appointing receiver in respect of the suit land.<br/> <br/>He further submits that there is no scope for putting a third party as a receiver of property of a joint family and admittedly when the members of the joint family have been enjoying the undivided property. He lastly submits that without taking into consideration the provision of Order 40 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the High Court Division set aside the judgment and order of the Court of appeal restoring the order of the Joint District Judge who appointed receiver behind the back of the defendants petitioners.<br/> <br/>Mr. Khorshed Alam Khan, learned Advocate appearing for the petitioners in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.397 of 2010 has adopted the submissions made by Dr. M. Zahir.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Aftab Hossain, learned Advocate-on-Record appearing for the respondents in both the leave petitions supports the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates, perused the impugned judgment and order delivered by the High Court Division and the materials on record. Admittedly the plaintiffs filed a suit for partition in 1982. The plaintiffs claimed a saham for 91 bighas of land and the defendants 182 bighas of land. In the application for appointment of receiver the plaintiffs stated that the defendants sold out lands by many deeds of sale numbering more than fifty exceeding their shares. The plaintiffs also stated that they could procure certified copies of four of such deeds only because of their poverty.<br/> <br/>The learned Joint District Judge, First Court, Dinajpur, by his order dated 02.11.2002 appointed receiver in respect of the suit land. The learned Joint District Judge came to a  finding that it could take long time for disposal of the suit because drawing up of final decree in a suit for partition usually would take long time and as such for management of the suit property, an Advocate Commissioner should be appointed as a receiver.<br/> <br/>The appellate Court took into considera-tion the findings arrived at by the trial Court in detail and came to a finding that appointment of receiver by the trial Court without hearing the other side was illegal and as such the ex-parte order could not sustain. The appellate Court also noted that the properties left behind by Muldhoni Cheharu Mohammad were the subject matter of Partition Suit No.16 of 1965 in which there was an admission about passing of a compromise decree in that suit and that without examination of that decree appointm-ent of receiver in respect of the suit land could not sustain. <br/> <br/>Without adverting to the findings arrived at by the appellate Court the High Court Division came to a finding that 27 years had already elapsed and that the case was still in rudimentary stage and that it might so happen that to dispose of the suit another twenty-seven years might be required. Therefore, the High Court Division set aside the judgment and order passed by the appellate Court restoring the order passed by the trial Court appointing the receiver in respect of the suit land.<br/> <br/>As was discussed earlier, the trial Court appointed receiver without assigning proper reason as contemplated under Order XL Rule I of the Code of Civil Procedure. On the other hand the appellate Court taking into consideration all aspects of the case reversed the order of learned Joint District Judge appointing receiver. The High Court Division, however, concurred with the cryptic and slipshod order passed by the trial Court appointing receiver in respect of the suit land.<br/> <br/>As a general Rule it is not proper to appoint a receiver in a suit for partition. Mere existence of a dispute can not be a ground whatsoever for appointment of a receiver. Receiver should be appointed in a suit for partition with the consent of the parties, especially where the family property consists of land. Delay in disposal of the suit cannot at all be a ground for appointment of a receiver in respect of the suit land. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had been exhausting their shares in the suit land. But the plaintiffs could only produce certified copies of four such deeds of sale although the defendants were stated to have sold land to different persons by more than fifty deeds. Admittedly the plaintiffs claimed a saham for 91 bighas of land and according to the plaintiffs the defendants are entitled to 182 bighas of land. Therefore, it appears  that the share of the defendants is double than that of the plaintiffs. Moreover, the plaintiffs could file an application for injunction praying for restraining the defend-ants by an order of temporary injunction from selling the suit land without prior permission of the Court. Instead of doing so the plaintiffs filed an application for appointment of receiver. The trial Court passed an order inducting a third party as receiver of the joint property of the family which goes against the cardinal principle of management of the property of a family.<br/> <br/>In this connection reliance may be made on the case of  <strong><em>Faiz Ahmed Chowdhury and another Vs. Baktear Ahmed Chowdhury and others (1984)36DLR(AD)97.</em></strong> In the above case, this Division relying upon a good number of cases, held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“As a general rule, the appoint-ment of a receiver in a particular suit has not met the approval of the Court. The existences of dispute offers no ground whatsoever for appointing a receiver. In Govind Narain Rao Desal Vs. Vallabhrao Narayantao Dasal, AIR 1920 Bom. 321, it has been observed that in a partition suit between members of a joint family the Court will not appoint a receiver except by consent, and especially where the family property consists of land. Special circumstances must be proved before the Court will make such appointment. The plaintiff must satisfy the Court that the property in posses-sion of the defendant is in danger of being wasted.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The principle expounded in the case referred to above applies to the facts and circumstances of the case in hand.<br/> <br/>In the case of <strong><em>Nurul Hossain Vs. Hasan Banu, (1983) 35 DLR 28, </em></strong>the High Court Division maintained the order of appointment of receiver as the plaintiffs who were female co-sharers had been kept out of enjoyment of the property and the defendants were appropriating all the rents of the tenanted premises from the tenants. The High Court Division has held that order 40 of the Code  of Civil Procedure confers very wide powers on the Court to appoint a receiver where it appears to the Court to be just and convenient. <br/> <br/>The question of appointment of the recei-ver arose in the above case as the female co-sharers were deprived of the rent of tenanted premises. In the case in hand the nature of the property is land and the share of the defendants is double than that of the plaintiffs. Therefore, the question of appointment of receiver in such a case does not arise.<br/> <br/>In the case of <strong><em>Razia Begum Vs. Rafique Chowdhury (1981) 33 DLR 198,</em></strong> the High Court Division set aside the order passed by the learned Subordinate Judge appointing receiver in a suit for partition on the ground that on an application filed by one of the defendants, the parties were directed to maintain a status-quo in respect of the suit property.<br/> <br/>In the present case, the plaintiffs could have filed an application praying for restraining the defendants by an order of temporary injunction from selling the suit land without prior permission of the Court but they failed to do so. <br/> <br/>What is important to note here is that in a suit for partition not merely the interest of the plaintiffs but also the interest of all the parties to the suit need be protected. The power to appoint a receiver as conferred by Order 40, rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, therefore, should, therefore, be sparingly used. The provisions for the appointment of a receiver is to be considered as one of the harshest remedies for the enforcement of rights to property.<br/> <br/>In the light of the findings made before, the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division cannot sustain. <br/> <br/>The present suit for partition has been pending before the trial Court. Therefore, we are of the view that instead of dragging the case in this Division, it would be proper to dispose of both the leave petitions to enable the trial Court to dispose of the suit as expeditiously as possible. <br/> <br/>Accordingly, both the petitions are disposed of and the impugned judgment and order passed by High Court Division is set aside. The plaintiffs will, however, be at liberty to file an application praying for restraining the defendants by an order of temporary injunction from selling any portion of the suit land without prior permission of the trial Court, if so advised.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>
