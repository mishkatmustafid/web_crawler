W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury was partly examined-in-chief and during the pendency of the case in the lower Court, he died and because of his death, his further examination-in-chief and cross-examination could not be completed. That the probative value of the statements made by the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury in his part examination-in-chief may be small depending upon the facts and circumstances of the present case....(142)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 154</strong><br/><strong>If the evidence of the P. W. 13 Md. Rajab Ali fits in with the attending circumstances of the case, then it may be taken into account and accepted along with other evidence on record. In other words, simply because the P. W. 13 Md. Rajab Ali is a hostile witness, his evidence can not be rejected out of hand.....(144)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 8 and 145</strong><br/><strong>It is well-settled that enmity cuts both ways, that is to say, because of previous enmity, the accused might have committed the offence on the one hand and again because of previous enmity, the accused might have been falsely implicated in the case on the other hand. In fact, enmity is like a double-edged sword. This being the scenario, only a critical appreciation of the evidence of the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury will reveal the stark reality. On a critical analysis of his ocular evidence, we do not find any vital omission, inconsistency or contradiction on any material aspect concerning the occurrence between his examination-in-chief and cross-examination. In such a landscape, we must say that his rock-like evidence puts the prosecution case on a definite foundation and to discredit or to dislodge him, the reasonable doubt that must be created in our mind must be based on the evidence on record itself and not on mere inferences, surmises, speculations and conjectures....(154-155)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 3 and 137</strong><br/><strong>We have put the direct evidence of the P.W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury to the closest scrutiny as is required by law and found the same quite trustworthy, unblemished, unimpeachable, impeccable and invincible. In his expansive and detailed evidence, the substantive part touching upon the factum of occurrence and its manner, method and sequence have not been shaken, deviated from or rendered doubtful in his cross-examination. The defence has failed to make any headway in this respect....(158)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 8</strong><br/><strong>Admittedly, the accused Lechu Meah was all along an absconder during the trial of the case. He had been on the run for about four years till his surrender before the Court below on 03.05.2007 after pronouncement of the impugned judgment. This long abscondence of the accused Lechu Meah without any explanation whatsoever is a relevant fact under Section 8 of the Evidence Act and favours the prosecution pointing a finger at his guilt, though abscondence by itself is not conclusive of one’s guilt....(162)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 161 and 537</strong><br/><strong>In the present case before us, investigation was started on the basis of the G. D. Entry No. 297 dated 09.08.2003 and that G.D. Entry is the ejahar of the case for all practical purposes and the subsequent so-called formal ejahar lodged by the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury with Biswanath Police Station may be construed as a statement under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. However, the non-treating of the G.D. Entry No. 297 dated 09.08.2003 as the ejahar of the case by the lower Court is curable by Section 537 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and will not affect the merit of the case....(166)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 8</strong><br/><strong>There is no onus on the prosecution to lead positive evidence of motive in a given case and a charge established by reliable evidence will not fail if there be no ostensible motive on the part of the accused to commit the crime. This being the legal position, the contention of Mr. S. M. Shahjahan stands jettisoned....(171)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Penal Code (XLV of 1860)</strong><br/><strong>Section 302/34</strong><br/><strong>It is abundantly clear from the conduct of the accused Ustar and Sohrab that by their active armed presence, they shared the common intention of the accused Mujib and Lechu which was formed at the spot on the spur of the moment when those accused did not find their target at the place of occurrence room, that is to say, P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury. Originally all the twelve accused were animated by common intention to kill the P. W. 1 and in furtherance of that common intention, they went to the place of occurrence. As they missed their target (Fatik Miah Chowdhury), the four accused, namely, Mujib, Sohrab, Ustar and Lechu developed their common intention to kill Lovely and Aklima, two innocent persons and in furtherance of their common intention, they (Lovely and Aklima) were done to death in a cruel manner.....(203)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Penal Code (XLV of 1860)</strong><br/><strong>Section 302/34</strong><br/><strong>Precisely speaking, the accused Shamshad, Selim, Abul Hossain, Amir Hossain and Amir Ali can not be connected with the killing of Lovely and Aklima in furtherance of common intention as contemplated by Section 34 of the Penal Code. Had all the twelve accused succeeded in killing the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury as planned, then those accused would have incurred the criminal liability under Sections 302/34 of the Penal Code. As the accused Shamshad, Selim, Abul Hossain, Amir Hossain and Amir Ali did not share the common intention of the accused Mujib, Sohrab, Ustar and Lechu, they can not be fastened with the criminal liability under Sections 302/34 of the Penal Code. That being so, the accused Shamshad, Selim, Abul Hossain, Amir Hossain and Amir Ali are liable to be acquitted of the charge levelled against them.    ...(204)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Penal Code (XLV of 1860)</strong><br/><strong>Section 300, Clause Firstly</strong><br/><strong>The manner of the occurrence as deposed to by the star prosecution witness (P. W. 2) Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury together with the evidence of the P. W. 4 Manjur Miah Chowdhury and P. W. 5 Kulsuma Begum and the medical evidence adduced by the P. W. 20 Dr. M. A. Shahid go to show that the criminal act was done with the intention of causing the death of Lovely and Aklima thus attracting the ingredients of Clause ‘Firstly’ of Section 300 of the Penal Code. This being the state of affairs, the criminal act commit-ted by the accused Mujib, Sohrab, Ustar and Lechu is culpable homicide amounting to murder....(212)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Penal Code (XLV of 1860)</strong><br/><strong>Section 302/34</strong><br/><strong>In a case under Sections 302/34 of the Penal Code when an accused is sentenced to death, he is not awarded any sentence of fine. In the instant case, the death sentence awardees have been sentenced to pay a fine of Tk. 1,000/- each. This sentence of fine awarded to the condemned-prisoners is improper or inapposite, though not illegal. As such, the sentence of fine imposed upon the condemned-prisoners, namely, Mujib Ali and Lechu Meah is knocked down....(217)</strong><br/> <br/><em>Nowabul Alam and others Vs.

Rafiqul Alam, Additional Sessions Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Sylhet in Sessions Case No. 169 of 2004 arising out of G. R. Case No. 87 of 2003 corresponding to Biswanath Police Station Case No. 07 dated 09.08.2003. By the impugned judgment and order, the learned Additional Sessions Judge convicted the accused-appellants under Section 302 of the Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced the appellants Mujib Ali and Lechu Meah @ Kamal Ahmed to death and to pay a fine of Tk. 1,000/- each and also convicted and sentenced the other appellants thereunder to suffer imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Tk. 1,000/- each, in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for a further period of 2(two) months each. He also convicted the appellants under various other Sections of the Penal Code and sentenced them thereunder to different terms of imprisonment. The learned Additional Sessions Judge also made a Reference to the High Court Division under Section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for confirmation of the death sentence imposed upon the appellants Mujib Ali and Lechu Meah.<br/> <br/>All the appeals and the Death Reference have been heard together and are disposed of by this consolidated judgment.<br/> <br/>The prosecution version of the case, in short, is as follows:<br/><br/>On 09.08.2003 at about 3.00/3.30 A. M. (in the early hours of 09.08.2003), the informant Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury and the members of his family were asleep at their house at village Nobhagi under Police Station Biswanath, District- Sylhet and at that time, at the sound of some people inside the bed-room of Hosne Ara Lovely, the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury woke up from sleep and saw the electric light of the room switched on and also saw four persons, namely, Mujib, Sohrab, Ustar and Lechu being armed with deadly weapons there. The accused Mujib made a query to Lovely as to the whereabouts of her husband and in case of her failure to disclose his whereabouts, they would finish her off. But Lovely refused to disclose the whereabouts of her husband to the accused Mujib. At this, the accused Mujib dealt a dagger blow on the head of Lovely as a result of which she fell down on her bed. He lifted her from the bed once again and wanted to know the whereabouts of her husband and when she refused to disclose the same, he again dealt a dagger blow on her head in consequence of which she fell down and started writhing in pain on the bed. At that point of time, Aklima Begum, a baby aged about one year and a half, who was beside Lovely on the bed started crying out and at this, the accused Lechu took her away from the room by holding her throat and thereafter all the accused left the place of occurrence. After the departure of the accused, the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury raised a hue and cry and on hearing the same, his paternal uncles, namely, Md. Manjur Miah Chowdhury and Md. Farid Miah Chowdhury along with their spouses and others came to the place of occurrence and he (P.W. 2) narrated the occurrence to them. Anyway, Md. Manjur Miah Chowdhury told that he woke up from sleep on hearing the crying sound of a child and wanted to open the door; but it was closed from outside and then he wanted to come out through the window by taking a ‘bendah’ in his hand and then the accused Abul Hossain, Sohrab and Shamshad dealt blows on the ‘bendah’. On hearing an outcry from Md. Manjur Miah Chowdhury, Md. Farid Miah Chowdhury woke up from sleep and opened the door. However, the informant-party could recognize all the accused, that is to say, Mujib, Sohrab, Ustar, Lechu, Shamshad, Selim, Bari, Aftab Ali, Abdul Matin, Amir Ali, Amir Hossain and Abul Hossain by means of electric lights. The husband of Lovely, namely, Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury (P. W. 1) came to the place of occurrence room from the drawing room of the house and the P.W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury and his paternal uncles narrated the occurrence to him (P. W. 1). Subsequently the informant-party looked for the whereabouts of Aklima and at one stage, they found her dead body floating in the pond behind their house. The police, however, lifted the dead body of Aklima from the pond and held inquests on the deceased Lovely and Aklima and sent the same to the morgue of Sylhet Osmany Medical College Hospital for autopsies. Thereafter the informant Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury (P.W. 1) lodged an ejahar with Biswanath Police Station against the accused.<br/> <br/>The Investigating Officer of the case is the P. W. 21 Sub-Inspector Md. Monjurul Murshed of Biswanath Police Station, Sylhet. During investigation, he visited the place of occurrence, made a sketch-map thereof along with a separate index, examined witnesses and recorded their statements under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Sub-Inspector Md. Monjurul Murshed also produced the accused Abul Hossain and Abdul Matin to the learned Magistrate concerned for recording of their confessional statements and accordingly, the learned Magistrate recorded the same as per Section 164 of the said Code. Sub-Inspector Md. Monjurul Murshed procured the autopsy-reports of the deceased Lovely and Aklima during investigation. Having found a prima facie case, Sub-Inspector Md. Monjurul Murshed submitted the charge-sheet no. 86 dated 24.11.2003 against all the accused under Sections 302/34 of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/>At the commencement of the trial of the case, the learned trial Judge charged all the accused under various Sections of the Penal Code including Sections 302/34 of the Penal Code, 1860. The charge was read over and explained to the accused present in the dock; but they pleaded not guilty thereto and claimed to be tried as per law.<br/> <br/>The defence version of the case, as it appears from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses, is that two paternal uncles of the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury, namely, Shahed Miah Chowdhury and Khaled Miah Chowdhury used to send money from abroad to the bank account of Lovely maintained with Sonali Bank, Kamal Bazar Branch, Biswanath, Sylhet and there were disputes with regard to that money between Lovely and other paternal uncles of the said P. W. 2 as a result of which those paternal uncles of the P. W. 2 killed Lovely and her baby Aklima and as such one Jamal Ahmed, maternal uncle of the P. W. 2, filed Petition Case No. 41 of 2003 against his five paternal uncles in the Criminal Court and the accused have been falsely implicated in this case out of previous enmity and bad blood and the alleged confessional statements of the accused Abul Hossain and Abdul Matin are the products of police torture, oppression and maltreatment.<br/> <br/>After hearing both the prosecution and the defence and on an appraisal of the evidence and materials on record and having regard to the attending circumstances of the case, the Court below came to the finding that the prosecution brought the charge home against the appellants and others and accordingly, it convicted and sentenced them by the impugned judgment and order as aforesaid.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved at and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order, the convict-appellants have preferred the instant appeals. As already observed, the learned trial Judge has also made a statutory reference to the High Court Division for confirmation of the death sentence imposed upon the appellants Mujib Ali and Lechu Meah @ Kamal Ahmed.<br/> <br/>The only point for determination in the appeals and the Death Reference is whether the impugned judgment and order dated 21.03.2007 is sustainable in law or not? <br/> <br/>At the outset, Mr. S. M. Shahjahan, learned Advocate appearing for the appellants in Criminal Appeal Nos. 4263 of 2007 and 2529 of 2007, submits that it is an admitted fact that the informant of the case, that is to say, Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury (P.W. 1) died during the pendency of the case in the lower Court and as such, he could not finish his deposition therebefore and since he was partly examined-in-chief, the evidentiary value of the statements made by him shall stand diminished.<br/> <br/>Mr. S. M. Shahjahan further submits that the evidence on record shows that after the occurrence, the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury gave a telephonic call to the local Chairman Md. Rajab Ali (P. W. 13) about the occurrence and the P. W. 13 in his turn gave a message to the then Second Officer of Biswanath Police Station, namely, Sub-Inspector Asaduzzaman about the occurrence and Sub-Inspector Asaduzzaman recorded G. D. Entry No. 297 dated 09.08.2003 (Exhibit-20) and after lodgment of the G. D. Entry with the Police Station, the police force under the leadership of Sub-Inspector Asaduzzaman rushed to the place of occurrence at village Nobhagi and the P. W. 21 Md. Monjurul Murshed held inquests on the deceased Lovely and Aklima and sent the same to the morgue of the hospital for autopsies; but curiously enough, the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury did not disclose the names of the accused at the time of his telephonic conversation with the P. W. 13 Md. Rajab Ali or to the police even at the time of holding inquests on the deceased Lovely and Aklima and by that reason, the P. W. 21 Md. Monjurul Murshed was not aware of the names of the accused and as such the two inquest-reports do not contain the names of any of the accused and the belated disclosure of the names of the accused by the P.W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury at the time of lodgment of the formal ejahar with the Police Station concerned gave a long rope to the prosecution for embellishment of the prosecution story; but the learned trial Judge failed to consider this aspect of the case occasioning a miscarriage of justice.<br/> <br/>Mr. S. M. Shahjahan also submits that in a criminal case, the disclosure of the names of the accused at the earliest opportunity is of paramount importance with a view to preventing any subsequent embellishment of the prosecution story and the lodgment of the formal ejahar with the Police Station after about 20(twenty) hours of the occurrence has rendered the prosecution case doubtful entitling his clients to an order of acquittal; but the learned trial Judge failed to take into account this dimension of the case resulting in a failure of justice.<br/> <br/>Mr. S. M. Shahjahan next submits that the only star prosecution witness is the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury who was aged about 14.5 years at the time of the occurrence and 16 years at the time of his deposition before the trial Court and he, being a tender boy and an interested witness, should not have been believed at all in view of the attending circumstances of the case especially due to non-disclosure of the names of the accused during 20(twenty) hours after the occurrence and prior to the lodgment of the formal ejahar with the Police Station; but the Court below placed its reliance on the P. W. 2 and illegally convicted and sentenced his clients.<br/> <br/>Mr. S. M. Shahjahan further submits that the occurrence took place during night-time and in this perspective, the means of recognition of the accused is of vital importance, but strangely enough, no electric bulb was seized from the place of occurrence by the Investigating Officer (P.W. 21) to prove the means of recognition and in the absence of seizure of any electric bulb, the prosecution case has become doubtful and in this view of the matter, the lower Court ought to have acquitted his clients of the charge levelled against them.<br/> <br/>Mr. S. M. Shahjahan also submits that the manner of entry of the accused Mujib and Lechu, amongst others, into the place of occurrence room at the relevant time has not been proved at all by the prosecution and this factum renders the prosecution version suspect entitling his clients to an order of acquittal.<br/> <br/>Mr. S. M. Shahjahan further submits that the confessional statement of the convict-appellant Abul Hossain is a product of police torture and oppression and taking his confessional statement as it stands, it does not manifest that he participated in the occurrence; but the lower Court did not consider this aspect of the case and wrongly convicted and sentenced Abul Hossain.<br/> <br/>Mr. S. M. Shahjahan next submits that having regard to the totality of the evidence on record and attending circumstances of the case, his clients (Mujib, Lechu and Abul Hossain) ought to have been awarded the benefit of doubt by the trial Court; but the trial Court on misappreciation of the evidence on record, erroneously convicted and sentenced them by the impugned judgment and as such the same is liable to be reversed.<br/> <br/>Mr. S. M. Shahjahan also submits that the common intention of the accused, if any, was to kill the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury and not his wife Lovely and their baby Aklima and in such view of the matter, it can not be said that the accused were animated by any common intention to kill Lovely and Aklima and it is also not understandable as to why the accused Mujib and Lechu would kill Lovely and Aklima respectively and the accused have been falsely implicated in the case out of previous animosity and against this backdrop, the accused should have been acquitted of the charge brought against them.<br/>In support of the above submissions, Mr. S. M. Shahjahan relies upon the decisions in the cases of Nowabul Alam and others Vs. The State, 15 BLD (AD) 54; Muslimuddin and others Vs. The State, 38 DLR (AD) 311; Abu Taher Chowdhury and others….Vs…The State, 11 BLD (AD) 2; Maharaja of Kolhapur Vs. S. Sundaram Ayyar and others,  AIR 1925 Madras 497; Abdul Latif alias Budu and others Vs. The State, 14 BLD (HCD) 94; The State Vs. Manjur, 15 BLD (HCD) 193 and The State Vs. Anwar Hossain and others, 14 BLC (HCD) 440.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Khabir Uddin Bhuiyan, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants in Jail Appeal Nos. 274 of 2007 and 275 of 2007, contends that the names of the appellants, namely, Mujib and Abul Hossain were not disclosed to the P. W. 13 Md. Rajab Ali by the informant (P. W. 1) Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury at the time of telephonic transmission of the message of the occurrence and the inquest-reports of the deceased Lovely and Aklima too are conspicuously silent about the names of the accused Mujib Ali, Abul Hossain and others and that being so, the prosecution case is doubtful; but the Court below did not consider this dimension of the case and illegally convicted and sentenced them by the impugned judgment.<br/> <br/>Mrs. Hamida Chowdhury, learned Advocate appearing for the appellants in Criminal Appeal Nos. 2018 of 2007 and 1913 of 2007, adopts the submissions advanced by the learned Advocate Mr. S. M. Shahjahan.<br/> <br/>Mrs. Shirin Afrozee, learned Advocate appearing for the appellant in Jail Appeal No. 273 of 2007, submits that in the facts and circumstances of the case and in view of the evidence on record, the prosecution case is doubtful and as such the appellant Amir Ali should have been acquitted of the charge levelled against him.<br/> <br/>Mr. Belayet Hossain, learned Advocate for the appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 2244 of 2011, does not appear before this Court at the time of hearing of the appeal. However, the appeal will be disposed of on merit.<br/> <br/>In contrast, Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam, learned Deputy Attorney-General appearing on behalf of the State-respondent  and in support of the Death Reference, argues that the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury is the star prosecution witness and he has given a blow-by-blow account of the occurrence leading to the death of Lovely and Aklima and he has remained unshaken in his cross-examination and by that reason, his evidence is worthy of credence, though he is an interested witness and the learned trial Judge rightly relied upon the expansive deposition of the P. W. 2 along with other evidence on record in convicting and sentencing the appellants and others and as such no exception can be taken to the impugned judgment.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam also argues that the informant Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury was shell-shocked and traumatized at the death of his wife Lovely and their child Aklima and on that account, he could not disclose the names of the accused to the P. W. 13 Md. Rajab Ali at the time of his telephonic conversation with him, but this circumstance has not rendered the prosecution case doubtful in any way.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam further argues that it is in the cross-examination of the P. W. 13 Md. Rajab Ali that prior to holding of the inquests of the deceased Lovely and Aklima, the P.W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury disclosed the names of the accused to Sub-Inspector Asaduzzaman and Sub-Inspector Asaduzzaman wrote an ejahar according to the narration given by the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury; but because of the sudden death of Sub-Inspector Asaduzzaman during the pendency of the case in the lower Court, no explanation is forthcoming as to what Sub-Inspector Asaduzzaman did with the plain-paper ejahar in view of the admitted fact that he did not initiate any case on the basis of that plain-paper ejahar and considered from this standpoint, it can not be said that the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury did not disclose the names of the accused prior to holding of the inquests of the deceased Lovely and Aklima and given this scenario and in view of the facts and circumstances of the case, the disclosure of the names of the accused can not be regarded as very belated.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam also argues that it is true that no plain-paper ejahar was given to the P. W. 21 Sub-Inspector Md. Monjurul Murshed and it is in his cross-examination that he did not receive any written or verbal ejahar from the informant-party before holding of the inquest of the deceased Lovely and Aklima; but the informant is not to blame for this state of affairs and it is only Sub-Inspector Asaduzzaman who is to blame for non-initiation of any case on the basis of the plain-paper ejahar which was written as per the dictation of the informant (P. W. 1) Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury and judged from this perspective, the lodgment of the formal ejahar with the Police Station concerned after 20(twenty) hours from the time of the occurrence will not tell upon the merit of the case.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam next argues that because of non-seizure of any electric bulb from the place of occurrence, the prosecution case can not be rendered doubtful in view of the unimpeachable and unblemished evidence of the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 4 Md. Manjur Miah Chowdhury and P. W. 5 Kulsuma Begum coupled with the medical evidence on record.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam further argues that the distance between the place of occurrence and Biswanath Police Station is 23 (twenty-three) kilometres and indisputably two persons, namely, Lovely and Aklima were done to death and what is more, a mature foetus (nine-month-old) was also killed in the uterus along with Lovely and after pulling himself together from this shock wave, the informant performed the funeral rites of the deceased Lovely and Aklima and in the process some time definitely elapsed and the delay for about 20(twenty) hours in the matter of lodgment of the formal ejahar with the concerned Police Station will not create any doubt as to the veracity of the prosecution case in any manner.   <br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam also argues that although the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 3 Md. Farid Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 4 Md. Manjur Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 5 Kulsuma Begum, P. W. 6 Ayesha Khanom, P. W. 7 Halima Begum, P. W. 8 Md. Monsur Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 9 Rubi Begum and P. W. 10 Sundari Bibi Chowdhury are interested witnesses, yet the fact remains that their evidence does not suffer from any legal infirmity and they have told the unvarnished truth to the trial Court and as they are credible witnesses despite their interestedness, the lower Court rightly convicted and sentenced the appellants and others by the impugned judgment.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam also argues that it is true that in furtherance of common intention to kill the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury, all the accused assembled at the place of occurrence and four of them, namely, Mujib, Ustar, Sohrab and Lechu entered the place of occurrence room and having failed to trace out the whereabouts of the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury, those four accused were animated by common intention to kill Lovely and Aklima and  that common intention developed at the spot on the spur of the moment and in furtherance of that common intention, both Lovely and Aklima were done to death in a brutal and gruesome manner and as such they were rightly served by the impugned judgment.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam further argues that the invincible ocular evidence of the star prosecution witness Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury (P.W. 2) stands corroborated by the medical evidence and the confessional statements of the accused Abul Hossain and Abdul Matin and this being the position, the learned trial Judge rightly believed the prosecution case and convicted and sentenced the appellants and others by the impugned judgment.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam also argues that the occurrence took place at dead of night and as such there was no scope to see the occurrence by any independent, disinterested and non-partisan witness and in this context, the prosecution had to rely necessarily on the evidence of the interested witnesses, namely, P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury and other inmates of the house.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam further argues that the defence version of the case that Lovely and Aklima were killed at the hands of the paternal uncles of the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury stands belied by the evidence of the P. W. 21 Md. Monjurul Murshed and the certificate of the local Sonali Bank Manager (Exhibit-18) and consequently the learned trial Judge legally accepted the prosecution version of the case and recorded the impugned order of conviction and sentence.<br/> <br/>In support of the above submissions, the learned Deputy Attorney-General Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam draws our attention to the decisions in the cases of The State represented by the Solicitor, Ministry of Law &amp; Justice, Government of Bangladesh Vs. Montu alias Nazrul Haque &amp; others, 44 DLR (AD) 287; The State Vs. Ful Mia, 5 BLC (AD) 41 and Chowdhury Nuruzzaman &amp; another Vs. The State, 6 BLC (AD) 58.<br/> <br/>We have heard the submissions of the learned Advocates Mr. S. M. Shahjahan, Mr. Md. Khabir Uddin Bhuiyan, Mrs. Hamida Chowdhury and Mrs. Shirin Afrozee and the counter-submissions of the learned Deputy Attorney-General Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam.<br/> <br/>With a view to arriving at a correct decision in the appeals as well as in the Death Reference, we are to advert to and scrutinize the relevant evidence and attending circumstances by way of juxtaposing both the prosecution and defence versions of the case.  <br/> <br/>At the trial, the prosecution has examined 22 (twenty-two) witnesses and tendered one witness in all on its side. But the defence has examined none.<br/> <br/>Anyway, the P.W. 1 is the informant Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury. He deposes that his nine-month-pregnant wife Hosne Ara Lovely and daughter Aklima, aged about one year and a half, were killed on 09.08.2003.<br/> <br/>The P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury also deposes that he retired as Havildar from the Army and their dwelling house is east-facing that extends from north to south and his brothers reside in the southern rooms of the house and there is a pathway between his dwelling rooms and those of his brothers under the same roof and his (P.W. 1) kitchen is contiguous to the southern room.<br/> <br/>The P.

Fatik Miah Chowdhury next deposes that on 09.08.2003, his wife Lovely and daughters Aklima and Mohima were on the cot in the 3<sup>rd</sup> room (bed-room) from the south and his sons Masud Miah Chowdhury and others slept on the floor of that room and in the northern room, his mother and two sons and one daughter slept.<br/> <br/>The P.

W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury also testifies that at about 3.00 o’clock during night-time, he woke up from sleep on hearing a sound, saw the electric light of the room switched on and also saw 4(four) persons, namely, Mujib, Sohrab, Ustar and Lechu armed with dao, dagger etc. and then the accused Mujib wanted to know the whereabouts of his father from his mother and when his mother refused to disclose his whereabouts, the accused Mujib dealt a dagger blow on her mother’s head as a result of which she fell down on the bed and the accused Mujib lifted her from the bed and wanted to know the whereabouts of his father from her once again and because of her refusal for the second time, the accused Mujib dealt another dagger blow on her head and at this she fell down on the bed again and started writhing in pain and at this point of time, his younger sister Aklima woke up from sleep and cried out and the accused Lechu took her away outside the room by holding her throat and the other accused also followed suit.<br/> <br/>The P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury next testifies that he raised a hue and cry and his paternal uncles Manjur Miah Chowdhury and Farid Miah Chowdhury along with their wives came to the place of occurrence room and he narrated the occurrence to them and then Manjur Miah Chowdhury told them that he woke up from sleep on hearing the crying sound of a child and wanted to open the door; but it was found closed from outside and then he wanted to come out through the window by taking a ‘bendah’ in his hand and then the accused Abul, Sohrab and Shamshad dealt blows on the ‘bendah’.<br/> <br/>The P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury also testifies that afterwards his father (P. W. 1) came to the place of occurrence room from the drawing room and he (P.W. 2) and his uncles narrated the occurrence to him.<br/> <br/>The P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury further testifies that they looked for the whereabouts of Aklima and found her dead body floating in the pond behind their house and in the following morning, the police lifted the dead body of Aklima from the pond, held inquests on the deceased Lovely and Aklima and sent the dead bodies to Sylhet Osmany Medical College Hospital for post-mortem examinations and after holding of post-mortem examinations, the dead bodies were buried and thereafter his father and paternal uncles Manjur Miah Chowdhury and Farid Miah Chowdhury and others went to Biswanath Police Station and his father lodged an ejahar therewith against the accused.<br/> <br/>The P.

W. 4 Md. Manjur Miah Chowdhury also denies a defence suggestion that the accused have been falsely implicated in the case out of political vengeance.<br/> <br/>In his cross-examination, the P.

Monjurul Murshed also states:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“এস, আই, আসাদুজ্জামান কয়টার সময় ঘটনাসহল ত্যাগ করে তাহা আমি ডায়েরীতে নোট করি নাই। আমরা ঘটনাসহলে গিয়া মাসুদ চৌধুরী বা ফটিক চৌধুরীর নিকট হইতে কোন মৌখিক বা লিখিত এজাহার নেই নাই।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In his cross-examination, the P. W. 21 Md.

He is a formal witness and as Officer-in-Charge of Malkhana, he received 10(ten) alamats of Biswanath Police Station Case No. 07(8)2003 corresponding to G. R. Case No. 87 of 2003.<br/><br/>The P. W. 23 is Mobasher Ali Mirza. He deposes that he has been posted as Sub-Inspector at Biswanath Police Station and as per order of the Court, he appeared before the Court with the G. D. Entry No. 297 dated 09.08.2003 and it appears from the G. D. Entry that on 09.08.2003, the Chairman of Khajanshi Union Parishad No. 2 Md. Rajab Ali sent a message over telephone that the wife and an infant of Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury had been killed at his house at village Nobhagi and on receipt of that telephonic message, Sub-Inspector Asaduzzaman recorded the G. D. Entry at 6.10 A. M. and pursuant to the G.D. Entry, they started for the place of occurrence and Sub-Inspector Asaduzzaman is now dead.<br/><br/>In his cross-examination, the P. W. 23 Mobasher Ali Mirza admits that there is no mention of the names of the accused in the G. D. Entry.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury was partly examined-in-chief and during the pendency of the case in the lower Court, he died and because of his death, his further examination-in-chief and cross-examination could not be completed. Now a pertinent question arises: what will be the evidentiary value of the statements made by Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury in his part examination-in-chief? In this context, Mr. S. M. Shahjahan has relied upon the decision in the case of Maharaja of Kolhapur Vs. S. Sundaram Ayyar and others, AIR 1925 Madras 497. In that decision, it has been held that where a witness dies after examination-in-chief and before cross-examination, the evidence is admissible; but the weight to be attached to such evidence should depend upon the circumstances of each case and though in some cases, the Court may act upon it if there is other evidence on record, its probative value may be very small and may even be disregarded. We are in complete agreement with the above principle enunciated by Madras High Court in the reported decision. Keeping this principle in view, we hold that the probative value of the statements made by the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury in his part examination-in-chief may be small depending upon the facts and circumstances of the present case.<br/><br/>It transpires that the P. W. 13 Md. Rajab Ali has been declared hostile by the prosecution in the midst of his examination-in-chief. So the P. W. 13 Md. Rajab Ali is a hostile witness. In this connection, the decision in the case of Siddique Munshi Vs. The State reported in 44 DLR (AD) 169 may be adverted to. In that decision, it was held, inter alia, in paragraph 9:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“9. A witness is not necessarily hostile if he reveals the truth. Established practice, now forming a rule of law, regarding the evidence of a hostile witness is that the whole of his evidence so far as it affects both the parties, favourably or unfavourably, must be considered and the Court which gets the opportunity to observe his demeanour is at liberty to make assessment of the evidence. If corroboration from other sources is available to the evidence of a hostile witness, there is no reason why his evidence should be rejected outright. If the evidence of the hostile witness fits in with the attending circumstances, then it may be accepted and considered along with other evidence.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>What we are driving at in this regard boils down to this: if the evidence of the P. W. 13 Md. Rajab Ali fits in with the attending circumstances of the case, then it may be taken into account and accepted along with other evidence on record. In other words, simply because the P. W. 13 Md. Rajab Ali is a hostile witness, his evidence can not be rejected out of hand.<br/><br/>Out of 23 (twenty-three) prosecution witnesses, the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 4 Md. Manjur Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 5 Kulsuma Begum, P. W. 13 Md. Rajab Ali, P. W. 20 Dr. M. A. Shahid and P. W. 21 Md. Monjurul Murshed appear to be vital witnesses in the facts and circumstances of the case. Out of them, the star prosecution witness is the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury. Professedly, he is an eye-witness to the occurrence, though he is an interested witness. As a matter of fact, the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 3 Md. Farid Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 4 Md. Manjur Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 5 Kulsuma Begum, P. W. 6 Ayesha Khanom, P. W. 7 Halima Begum, P. W. 8 Md. Monsur Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 9 Rubi Begum and P. W. 10 Sundari Bibi Chowdhury are all inter-related and interested witnesses in this case. Now a million-dollar question arises: can the Court reject the evidence of those partisan and interested witnesses outright on the ground of their interestedness and partisanship. The answer is obviously in the negative. In this connection, the decision in the case of Nowabul Alam and others Vs. The State reported in 15 BLD (AD) 54 adverted to by Mr. S. M. Shahjahan may be called in aid. In that decision, it was held in paragraph 17:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“17. The principle that is to be followed is that the evidence of persons falling in the category of interested, inter-related and partisan witnesses, must be closely and critically scrutinized. They should not be accepted on their face value. Their evidence can not be rejected outright simply because they are interested witnesses for that will result in a failure of justice, but their evidence is liable to be scrutinized with more care and caution than is necessary in the case of disinterested and unrelated witnesses. An interested witness is one who has a motive for falsely implicating an accused person and that is the reason why his evidence is initially suspect. His evidence has to cross the hurdle of critical appreciation. As his evidence can not be thrown out mechanically because of his interestedness, so his evidence can not be accepted mechanically without a critical examination. As Hamoodur Rahman, J (as his Lordship then was) observed in the case of Ali Ahmed Vs. State (14 DLR (SC) 81):</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Prudence, of course, requires that the evidence of an interested witness should be scrutinized with care and conviction should not be based upon such evidence alone unless the Court can place implicit reliance thereon.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the decision in the case of Masalti Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1965 (SC) 202, the Indian Supreme Court observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“There is no doubt that when a Criminal Court has to appreciate evidence given by witnesses who are partisan or interested, it has to be very careful in weighing such evidence. Whether or not there are discrepancies in the evidence, whether or not the evidence strikes the Court as genuine, whether or not the story disclosed by the evidence is probable, are all matters which must be taken into account. But it would, we think, be unreasonable to contend that evidence given by witnesses should be discarded only on the ground that it is evidence of partisan or interested witnesses. Often enough, where factions prevail in villages and murders are committed as a result of enmity between such factions, Criminal Courts have to deal with the evidence of a partisan type. The mechanical rejection of such evidence on the sole ground that it is partisan would inevitably lead to failure of justice. No hard and fast rule can be laid down as to how such evidence should be appreciated. Judicial approach has to be cautious in dealing with such evidence; but the plea that such evidence should be rejected because it is partisan can not be accepted as correct.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The rule that the evidence of interested witnesses requires corroboration is not an inflexible one. It is a rule of caution rather than an ordinary rule of appreciation of evidence. The Supreme Court of Pakistan spelt out the rule in the case of Nazir Vs. The State, 14 DLR (SC) 159 as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“……………………………………………we had not intention of laying down an inflexible rule that the statement of an interested witness (by which expression is meant a witness who has a motive for falsely implicating an accused person) can never be accepted without corroboration. There may be an interested witness whom the Court regards as incapable of falsely implicating an innocent person. But he will be an exceptional witness and, so far as an ordinary interested witness is concerned, it can not be said that it is safe to rely upon his testimony in respect of every person against whom he deposes. In order, therefore, to be satisfied that no innocent persons are being implicated along with the guilty, the Court will in the case of an ordinary interested witness look for some circumstances that give sufficient support to his statement so as to create that degree of probability which can be made the basis of conviction. That is what is meant by saying that the statement of an interested witness ordinarily needs corroboration.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>If on consideration of the evidence and the circumstances, it is seen that the witnesses are related to one another and to the deceased also, in such a situation what the Court should do came up for consideration in the case of Abdul Karim Vs. State and another reported in 1981 BLD (AD) 200 wherein it was observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Relationship by itself can not be a ground for rejecting testimony of a witness unless it is shown that the witness was biased and resorted to falsehood.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The decisions in the cases of Mohammad Ali alias Shanu Vs. The State, 13 MLR (AD) 121 and Siraj Mal and others Vs. The State, 45 DLR (HCD) 688 are also in the same vein.<br/>In the case of the State Vs. Ful Mia reported in 5 BLC (AD) 41 referred to by the Deputy Attorney-General Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam, it has been held in paragraph 16 that interested evidence by itself can not be a ground to discard the evidence if one is found to be a truthful witness and telling the truth.<br/><br/>In the case of the State of Rajasthan Vs. Smt. Kalki and another reported in AIR 1981 (SC) 1390, the Indian Supreme Court held in paragraph 6:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“6. In the depositions of witnesses, there are always normal discrepancies, however honest and truthful they may be. These discrepancies are due to normal errors of observation, normal errors of memory due to lapse of time, due to mental disposition such as shock and horror at the time of the occurrence, and the like. Material discrepancies are those which are not normal, and not expected of a normal person.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Keeping the above principle in view, we are to scan the testimony of the star prosecution witness Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury (P. W. 2) and other interested witnesses.<br/>It transpires from the testimony of the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury that he has narrated the occurrence in a vivid, graphic and pictorial manner. In other words, he has given a blow-by-blow account of the occurrence leading to the death of Lovely and Aklima. According to his deposition, the accused Mujib, Ustar, Sohrab and Lechu appeared on the scene of occurrence at dead of night and the accused Mujib wanted to know from Lovely as to the whereabouts of her husband, namely, Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury (since deceased) and in case of her repeated refusal, the accused Mujib dealt two dagger blows on the head of Lovely resulting in her instantaneous death on the cot at the place of occurrence room.<br/><br/>It has been contended on the side of the defence that the accused have been falsely implicated in the case out of previous enmity and bad blood. But the cause of enmity and bad blood has not been spelt out by the defence. It is not clear from the evidence and materials on record as to why the informant-party and the accused-party are at odds with each other. In other words, we are in the dark about the bone of contention between the parties. However, it is well-settled that enmity cuts both ways, that is to say, because of previous enmity, the accused might have committed the offence on the one hand and again because of previous enmity, the accused might have been falsely implicated in the case on the other hand. In fact, enmity is like a double-edged sword. This being the scenario, only a critical appreciation of the evidence of the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury will reveal the stark reality.<br/><br/>It seems that the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury has remained unshaken in his cross-examination. On a critical analysis of his ocular evidence, we do not find any vital omission, inconsistency or contradiction on any material aspect concerning the occurrence between his examination-in-chief and cross-examination. In such a landscape, we must say that his rock-like evidence puts the prosecution case on a definite foundation and to discredit or to dislodge him, the reasonable doubt that must be created in our mind must be based on the evidence on record itself and not on mere inferences, surmises, speculations and conjectures.<br/><br/>It transpires that the ocular evidence of the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury has a natural flow and the same does not at all appear to be laboured in character. He has dourly stood his ground. His evidence, so to say, is impregnable on all points. In his expansive evidence, we do not come across any marks of blemish or falsehood. In such a posture of things, we opine that the ocular evidence of the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury excludes the possibility of any inference of fabrication, concoction, tutoring and rehearsal.<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it is in the evidence of the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury that he showed the electric bulb to the Investigating Officer by the light of which he had recognized the accused Mujib, Sohrab, Ustar and Lechu inside the occurrence room and the Investigating Officer seized it; but in fact, no bulb was seized by the Investigating Officer during the investigation of the case. Barring this single statement in the evidence of the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury, the evidence of the P. W. 2 inspires confidence in us. Although the above statement does not accord with the other evidence on record, that statement may be ignored as a normal discrepancy of an eye-witness as found by the Indian Supreme Court in the case of the State of Rajasthan Vs. Smt. Kalki and another reported in AIR 1981 (SC) 1390.<br/><br/>We have put the direct evidence of the P.W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury to the closest scrutiny as is required by law and found the same quite trustworthy, unblemished, unimpeachable, impeccable and invincible. In his expansive and detailed evidence, the substantive part touching upon the factum of occurrence and its manner, method and sequence have not been shaken, deviated from or rendered doubtful in his cross-examination. The defence has failed to make any headway in this respect.<br/><br/>As the occurrence took place at dead of night, there was virtually no scope to eye-witness the occurrence by any independent, disinterested and non-partisan witness. It was rather impracticable on the part of such a witness to see the occurrence inside the bed-room (place of occurrence room) of the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury. The evidence on record shows that the police and villagers arrived at the place of occurrence house at about 7.00/7.30 A. M. whereas the occurrence took place at about 3.00/3.30 A.M. on 09.08.2003. During this interregnum, no people other than the inmates of the house were available at the place of occurrence house. On the arrival of the P. W. 13 Md. Rajab Ali and others at the place of occurrence house, the informant wanted to disclose the names of the accused to the P. W. 13 Md. Rajab Ali; but he wanted the informant to disclose the same to the police and accordingly, the informant Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury disclosed the names of the accused to Sub-Inspector Asaduzzaman (since deceased). In this regard, the relevant part of the cross-examination of the P. W. 13 Md. Rajab Ali may be adverted to−</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“ঐ দারোগার নাম আসাদুজ্জামান। ফটিক চৌধুরী উপস্থিত লোকদের সরাইয়া একটি রুমের মধ্যে দারোগার কাছে আসামীদের নাম বলে। তখন দারোগা সাহেব আসামীদের নাম লিখিয়াছেন ঐ লেখাটি এজাহার আকারে দারোগা সাহেব বাদীর কথিত মতে লেখেন। এজাহারের পর দারোগা লাশের সুরতহাল করে।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Undeniably, the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury, P.W. 3 Md. Farid Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 4 Md. Manjur Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 5 Kulsuma Begum, P. W. 6 Ayesha Khanom, P. W. 7 Halima Begum, P. W. 8 Md. Monsur Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 9 Rubi Begum and P. W. 10 Sundari Bibi Chowdhury are all inmates of the place of occurrence house. It appears from the evidence of the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury that immediately after the occurrence at the place of occurrence room, the other inmates, that is to say, the P.W. 3 Md. Farid Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 4 Md. Manjur Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 5 Kulsuma Begum, P. W. 6 Ayesha Khanom, P. W. 7 Halima Begum, P. W. 8 Md. Monsur Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 9 Rubi Begum, P. W. 10 Sundari Bibi Chowdhury and P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury rushed to the place of occurrence room and the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury narrated the occurrence to them and the P.Ws 3 to 10 in turn also corroborated the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury in this respect, though they are interested witnesses. The taking away of the infant Aklima by the accused Lechu Meah from the place of occurrence room by holding her throat at the relevant time has been corroborated by the evidence of the P. W. 4 Md. Manjur Miah Chowdhury and P. W. 5 Kulsuma Begum. In other words, these two witnesses, namely, the P. W. 4 Md. Manjur Miah Chowdhury and P. W. 5 Kulsuma Begum eye-witnessed that part of the occurrence which related to the taking away of Aklima by the accused Lechu Meah by holding her throat at the material time. We do not find any marks of falsehood in the evidence of the P. W. 3 Md. Farid Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 4 Md. Manjur Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 5 Kulsuma Begum, P. W. 6 Ayesha Khanom, P. W. 7 Halima Begum, P. W. 8 Md. Monsur Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 9 Rubi Begum and P. W. 10 Sundari Bibi Chowdhury. They have stood the test of cross-examination remarkably well. We hardly find any inconsistency or discrepancy or contradiction between their examination-in-chief and cross-examination. Against this backdrop, we are led to hold that the evidence of the P. W. 3 Md. Farid Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 4 Md. Manjur Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 5 Kulsuma Begum, P. W. 6 Ayesha Khanom, P. W. 7 Halima Begum, P. W. 8 Md. Monsur Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 9 Rubi Begum and P. W. 10 Sundari Bibi Chowdhury is worthy of credence.<br/><br/>The ocular evidence of the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury, it transpires, stands corroborated by the evidence of the P. W. 20 Dr. M. A. Shahid and attending circumstances of the case.<br/><br/>Besides, admittedly the accused Lechu Meah was all along an absconder during the trial of the case. He had been on the run for about four years till his surrender before the Court below on 03.05.2007 after pronouncement of the impugned judgment. This long abscondence of the accused Lechu Meah without any explanation whatsoever is a relevant fact under Section 8 of the Evidence Act and favours the prosecution pointing a finger at his guilt, though abscondence by itself is not conclusive of one’s guilt.<br/><br/>It appears that Mr. S. M. Shahjahan has rightly contended that the G. D. Entry No. 297 dated 09.08.2003 lodged with Biswanath Police Station on receipt of a telephonic message about the occurrence from the P. W. 13 Md. Rajab Ali should be construed as an ejahar being the first information in point of time with regard to the commission of the offence and the so-called ejahar lodged by the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury was illegally admitted in evidence on the side of the prosecution. In this context, Mr. S. M. Shahjahan has relied upon the decisions in the cases of The State Vs. Anwar Hossain and others, 14 BLC (HCD) 440 and Muslimuddin and others Vs. The State, 38 DLR (AD) 311.<br/><br/>In the decision reported in 38 DLR (AD) 311, our Appellate Division has held that in the early morning “somebody” was sent to the Police Station to give an information about this gruesome murder. In point of time that information carried to the police “by somebody” is the First Information Report within the meaning of Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and all subsequent information falls within the purview of Section 161 of the said Code.<br/><br/>In the decision reported in 14 BLC (HCD) 440, it was held, amongst others, in paragraph 70:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“70. The P.W. 18, the Investigating Officer, testified that he went to the place of occurrence at 7.00 A. M. on the basis of a G.D. Entry made at 6.30 A. M. in the Police Station. The inquest of the dead body of the deceased was made at 7.45 A. M. on the basis of G.D. Entry No. 930 dated 14.01.2002. Inquest was made in presence of the P.W. 1 who was one of the witnesses of inquest-report. The P. W. 1 after making inquest of the dead body of the deceased went to the Police Station and lodged FIR at 10.05 A.M. Thus it appears that investigation of the case was started before lodging the FIR. In fact, investigation was started on the basis of the G. D. Entry. Police after getting the information that the deceased was killed entered that information in the G. D. and then came to the place of occurrence and started investigation. Thus, according to law, that G. D. Entry No. 930 dated 14.01.2002 is the FIR in the present case.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Reverting to the case in hand, it is admitted that the G. D. Entry No. 297 dated 09.08.2003 was lodged with Biswanath Police Station at the instance of the P. W. 13 Md. Rajab Ali at 6.10 A. M. and at about 7.00/7.30 A. M., the police personnel under the leadership of Sub-Inspector Asaduzzaman went to the place of occurrence house and the P. W. 21 Sub-Inspector Md. Monjurul Murshed held inquests on the deceased Lovely and Aklima pursuant to that G. D. Entry. In view of the decisions reported in 38 DLR (AD) 311 and 14 BLC (HCD) 440, we are led to hold that in the present case before us, investigation was started on the basis of the G. D. Entry No. 297 dated 09.08.2003 and that G.D. Entry is the ejahar of the case for all practical purposes and the subsequent so-called formal ejahar lodged by the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury with Biswanath Police Station may be construed as a statement under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. However, the non-treating of the G.D. Entry No. 297 dated 09.08.2003 as the ejahar of the case by the lower Court is curable by Section 537 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and will not affect the merit of the case.<br/><br/>Now let us address the question of belated disclosure of the names of the accused to the police as raised by Mr. S. M. Shahjahan. The occurrence took place on 09.08.2003 at about 3.00/3.30 A. M. and the informant lost his wife and their infant daughter Aklima. So it is quite natural that having lost his nine-month-pregnant wife Lovely and their infant daughter Aklima, the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury was traumatized, perplexed and shell-shocked and was in a fix as to what to do. Anyway, at a subsequent stage, he made a telephone call to the Chairman Md. Rajab Ali (P.W. 13) who in turn sent the message of the occurrence to the Second Officer of Biswanath Police Station, namely, Sub-Inspector Asaduzzaman. On the basis of that message about the occurrence, the G. D. Entry No. 297 dated 09.08.2003 was recorded at 6.10 A. M. In the facts and circumstances of the case, it seems to us that the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury being under the spell of bewilderment and shock wave failed to communicate the names of the accused to the P. W. 13 Md. Rajab Ali at the time of the telephonic conversation. But as soon as the police-party led by Sub-Inspector Asaduzzaman arrived at the place of occurrence at about 7.00/7.30 A. M. pursuant to the G. D. Entry No. 297 dated 09.08.2003 the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury wanted to disclose the names of the accused to the P. W. 13 Md. Rajab Ali; but the P. W. 13 instructed the P. W. 1 to disclose the names of the accused to the police and accordingly, the P. W. 1 disclosed the names of the accused to Sub-Inspector Asaduzzaman in a room of the place of occurrence house and Asaduzzaman wrote down the names of the accused on a sheet of paper in the form of an ejahar as is evident from the cross-examination of the P. W. 13 Md. Rajab Ali.<br/><br/>It is also in the cross-examination of the P. W. 13 Md. Rajab Ali that inquests were held on the deceased Lovely and Aklima after the disclosure of the names of the accused to Sub-Inspector Asaduzzaman by the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury. But in his cross-examination, the P. W. 21 Sub-Inspector Md. Monjurul Murshed has stated that they did not take any written or oral ejahar either from Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury (P. W. 1) or from Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury (P. W. 2) on their arrival at the place of occurrence. In this perspective, it may be pointed out that Sub-Inspector Asaduzzaman left the place of occurrence prior to the departure of the police-party as is manifest from the cross-examination of the P. W. 21 Md. Monjurul Murshed. From the tone and tenor of the cross-examination of the P. W. 21 Md. Monjurul Murshed, it appears to us that for some reason or other, Sub-Inspector Asaduzzaman left the place of occurrence leaving behind Sub-Inspector Md. Monjurul Murshed (P. W. 21) and other police personnel there. As already observed, the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury disclosed the names of the accused to Sub-Inspector Asaduzzaman in a room of the place of occurrence house in confidence. Against this backdrop, the P. W. 21 Md. Monjurul Murshed might not be aware of the disclosure of the names of the accused to Sub-Inspector Asaduzzaman by the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury and probably on that count, the names of the accused did not appear in the inquest-reports of Lovely and Aklima. In this regard, the role of Sub-Inspector Asaduzzaman appears to be cryptic and mysterious.<br/><br/>It does not stand to reason and logic as to why Sub-Inspector Azaduzzaman failed to register a case on the basis of the plain-paper ejahar lodged with him by the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury at the spot. Since Sub-Inspector Asaduzzaman died during the pendency of the case in the lower Court, no explanation could be obtained from him in this respect. Indisputably the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury did not disclose the names of the accused to the P. W. 13 Md. Rajab Ali at the time of the telephonic conversation. As a natural consequence thereto, the names of the accused did not find place in the G. D. Entry No. 297 dated 09.08.2003. There was, no doubt, some delay in the matter of disclosure of the names of the accused, but the delay, in the facts and circumstances of the case, will not render the prosecution case doubtful in any view of the matter. In this connection, the reference to the decisions in the cases of Abu Taher Chowdhury and others….Vs…The State, 11 BLD (AD) 2 and Nowabul Alam and others Vs. The State, 15 BLD (AD) 54 will be of no avail to Mr. S. M. Shahjahan.<br/><br/>As to the contention of Mr. S. M. Shahjahan that the manner of entry of the accused Mujib and Lechu, amongst others, into the place of occurrence room at the material time has not been proved at all by the prosecution, we find from the evidence on record that the accused Mujib, Lechu, Sohrab and Ustar entered the place of occurrence room at the relevant time by breaking open the fence of the kitchen of the P.W. 1 Fatik Miah Chowdhury (informant). But how did they enter the place of occurrence room through the kitchen when admittedly the said room was closed from inside? This question needs to be answered. It is within the especial knowledge of the defence as regards how they entered the place of occurrence room from the kitchen. So the prosecution can not prove this factum. Anyway, as we see it, the accused Mujib, Lechu, Sohrab and Ustar entered the place of occurrence room at dead of night (on 09.08.2003 at 3.00/3.30 A. M.) by somehow opening its door through the kitchen. Given this scenario, we are not impressed by the contention of Mr. S. M. Shahjahan.<br/><br/>As regards the contention of Mr. S. M. Shahajan that it is not understandable as to why the accused Mujib and Lechu would kill Lovely and Aklima at the place of occurrence room instead of their target, namely, Fatik Miah Chowdhury (P. W. 1), we feel tempted to advert to the decision in the case of Lal Khan...Vs…Muhammad Sadiq and others reported in 20 DLR (SC) 306. In that decision, it has been clearly, categorically and unequivocally observed that what moves an individual to commit the crime being within his exclusive knowledge, there is no onus on the prosecution to lead positive evidence of motive in a given case and a charge established by reliable evidence will not fail if there be no ostensible motive on the part of the accused to commit the crime. This being the legal position, the contention of Mr. S. M. Shahjahan stands jettisoned.<br/><br/>The accused Abdul Matin and Abul Hossain are confessing accused. As Abdul Matin is not an appellant before us, we will not discuss his confessional statement in detail. But as the accused Abul Hossain is an appellant before us, the voluntariness and truth or otherwise of his confessional statement will be gone into.<br/><br/>There are certain criteria to assess the judicial confession of an accused. In the case of Habibur Rahman @ Habib….Vs…The State reported in 8 BLD (HCD) 210, it was observed in paragraph 15:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“15………………………………………….…………………………………………………………………………………………. ….</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Before a Court acts upon a confessional statement, it has to affirmatively satisfy that the statement is voluntary and true. In this regard, the judicial authorities always insist on the meticulous observance of all necessary formalities and precautions provided in Section 164 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure with minute particularity so as to ensure that the confession is absolutely free from the slightest tinge or taint of extraneous influence. ‘It is a settled principle of law’ as pointed out by a Division Bench of this Court in the case of Zaheda Bewa and another Vs. The State reported in 1985 BLD 9 ‘that the requirement of adherence to the provisions of Section 164 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not a mere matter of form, but of substance. Section 164 (3) is a mandatory provision of law as has been settled by the Privy Council in the case of Nazir Ahmed Vs. The King Emperor, AIR 1936 P.C 253’. Before recording a confession, a Magistrate is bound to make a real and substantial enquiry as to the voluntariness of the confession. In so doing, he must put questions to the accused with a view to finding out the real object of the confession, whether it is made out of repentance or for any other such good reason or whether it is the result of torture or tutoring by some body or whether it has been caused by any inducement, threat or promise. The questions put by the Magistrate and the answers given by the accused furnish sufficient data for coming to the conclusion whether the statement was voluntary or not.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the decision in the case of Abul Hossain and others Vs. The State reported in 13 BLD (HCD) 311, it has been held, inter alia, in paragraph 7 that Sub-Section (3) of Section 164 speaks of the manner as to how the confession of an accused is to be recorded by a Magistrate and this is a mandatory provision and failure to comply therewith shall make the confession invalid and unreliable. It has been further held therein that this provision of law together with the provisions of Section 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure require to be strictly observed and followed to make the confession voluntary and true in the real sense to be fit for reliance for convicting an accused on his confession.<br/><br/>In the case of Nurul Haque and another Vs. The State reported in 20 DLR (HCD) 780, it was observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Before recording the confession, it must be explained to the accused that he is not bound to make a confession and if he makes a confession, it may be used as evidence against him. It is a mandatory provision of law. No Magistrate should record any confession unless, upon putting questions to the accused, he has reason to believe that the confession was made voluntarily. Any defect arising out of violation of any mandatory provision of law is not curable under Section 533 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>A reference may be made to the decision reported in 1986 (BLD) 436 (Ali Asgar and another Vs. The State). In the said decision at page 438, it was held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Now let us consider the value of a retracted confession as against the maker. On consideration of evidence on record, if it is found that a confession is voluntary and true, conviction of the maker himself can solely be based upon the same, no matter whether it is retracted or not. In the case of the State Vs. Minbun alias Gul Hassan reported in 16 DLR (Supreme Court) page 598, their Lordships of the Supreme Court held as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>‘As against the maker himself, his confession, judicial or extra-judicial, whether retracted, or not retracted, can in law validly form the sole basis of his conviction. So we are also of the opinion that a confession, if proved true and voluntary, can be the sole basis for conviction of the maker of the confession.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of the State Vs. Punardhar Joydhar alias Kudu and Shefali reported in 31 DLR (HCD) 312, it has been held that the accused first made a confessional statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure that he committed that murder, although subsequently he retracted his confessional statement before the Court and the confession being found voluntary and without any threat, coercion or inducement, conviction of the accused based on his confession, though subsequently retracted by him, is valid in law.<br/><br/>The principle that has been enunciated in the case of Hazrat Ali and another….Vs…The State reported in 1990 BLD (HCD) 38 is that once a confession has been found to be true and voluntary, conviction can be based solely on the confession, even if it is retracted.<br/><br/>The ‘ratio decidendi’ of the case of Bakul Chandra Sarkar Vs. The State reported in 45 DLR (HCD) 260 is that if a confession recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is true and voluntary, the same alone is sufficient for convicting the confessing accused and retraction of confession is immaterial, once it is found to be true and voluntary.<br/><br/>Keeping the aforesaid decisions in view, let us deal with the confessional statement of the accused Abul Hossain. His confession (Exhibit-8) runs as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“আমার নাম আবুল হোসেন। পিতা- মৃত আঃ আজীজ। আমরা ৫ ভাই দুই বোন। আমি ভাই-বোনদের মধ্যে চতুর্থ। গত ৮/৮/০৩ তারিখ সোহরাব ও বারী মিয়া রাত অনুমান ৩টার দিকে ফটিক মিয়া চৌধুরীর বাড়ীতে ডেকে নিয়ে যায়। আমরা সর্ব মোট ১২জন ছিলাম যেমন সোহরাব, বারী মিয়া, ওস্টার আলী, লেচু মিয়া, সেলিম, শমশের মিয়া, আফতাব আলী, মতিন, মুজিব, আমির আলী, আমির ও আমি আবুল হোসেন। আমরা ফটিক মিয়া চৌধুরীর বাড়ী ঢুকি। সোহরাব, ওস¹ার, মুজিব ও লেচু ফটিক মিয়ার ঘরে ঢুকে। মুজিব ফটিক মিয়ার স্ত্রীকে দাও দিয়ে কোপ দেয়। এক কোপেই ফটিকেরস্ত্রী মারা যায়। লেচু মিয়া ফটিক মিয়ার মেয়েকে ঘরের ভিতরে গলা টিপে মেরে ফেলে পাশের পুকুরে নিয়ে ফেলে দেয়। তারপর আমরা চলে আসি।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>There is no gainsaying the fact that the confessional statement of Abul Hossain has been recorded in the prescribed form. A reference to the confessional statement clearly and unmistakably shows that the learned Magistrate Md. Mojibur Rahman (P. W. 15) has recorded the same after substantially complying with all legal formalities. He has given all statutory warnings to the accused before recording his confession. Mr. Md. Mojibur Rahman, before recording the confession, has explained to the accused Abul Hossain that he is not bound to make any confession and if he does so, that may be used as evidence against him and thereafter he has become satisfied upon questioning him that he is making the confession voluntarily.<br/><br/>It is the contention of Mr. S. M. Shahjahan that the confessional statement of Abul Hossain is a product of police torture and oppression. But it does not appear from the evidence of the P. W. 15 Md. Mojibur Rahman that he has found any marks of injuries on the person of the accused Abul Hossain at the time of recording of the confession. A suggestion has been put to the P. W. 21 Md. Monjurul Murshed in his cross-examination that the confessional statement of Abul Hossain was extorted by breaking his right jaws, but that suggestion has been squarely denied by the P. W. 21. Besides, it does not transpire from the evidence of the P. W. 15 Md. Mojibur Rahman that the accused Abul Hossain has complained of any torture or oppression or maltreatment to him at the time of recording of his confession. The record shows that a petition was filed by the accused Abul Hossain on 08.11.2003 retracting his earlier confessional statement. As already held, retraction of confession by an accused is immaterial, once it is found to be true and voluntary.<br/><br/>Regard being had to the evidence of the P. W. 15 Md. Mojibur Rahman (confession-recording Magistrate) and the Investigating Officer Md. Monjurul Murshed (P. W. 21) and on consideration of the confessional statement of Abul Hossain (Exhibit-8), it seems to us that the confessional statement is true and voluntary. This is why, the subsequent retraction of the confession on 08.11.2003 by the accused Abul Hossain is of no consequence.<br/><br/>The evidence of the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 3 Md. Farid Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 4 Md. Manjur Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 5 Kulsuma Begum, P. W. 6 Ayesha Khanom, P. W. 7 Halima Begum, P. W. 8 Md. Monsur Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 9 Rubi Begum and P. W. 10 Sundari Bibi Chowdhury receives support from the confessional statements of the accused Abul Hossain and Abdul Matin.<br/><br/>The seizure of the alamats of the case like blood-stained wearing-apparels of the deceased, broken bamboo fence, blood-stained pillows, bed-sheet, ‘bendah’ etc. by the P.W. 21 Md. Monjurul Murshed supports the prosecution version of the case.<br/><br/>To our mind, the non-seizure of any electric bulb from the place of occurrence, in the facts and circumstances of the case and in the face of the evidence on record, will not tell upon the prosecution case on merit. In this context, the decisions in the cases of Abdul Latif alias Budu and others Vs. The State, 14 BLD (HCD) 94 and The State Vs. Manjur, 15 BLD (HCD) 193 relied on by Mr. S. M. Shahjahan do not help him in any way.<br/><br/>On the contrary, the decision in the case of Chowdhury Nuruzzaman and another Vs. The State, 6 BLC (AD) 58 referred to by the learned Deputy Attorney-General Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam does not exactly fit in with the facts and circumstances of the case in hand. So the reference to that decision of the Appellate Division is wide of the mark.<br/><br/>It may be recalled that the defence version of the case is that Shahed Miah Chowdhury and Khaled Miah Chowdhury, paternal uncles of the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury, used to send money to Lovely from abroad and there were disputes with regard to that money between Lovely and other paternal uncles of the P. W. 2 as a result of which those paternal uncles of the P. W. 2 killed Lovely and Aklima at the material time for which one Jamal Ahmed, maternal uncle of the P. W. 2, filed Petition Case No. 41 of 2003 against his five paternal uncles in the Criminal Court and the present accused have been falsely implicated in the case out of previous animosity. It is admitted that Jamal Ahmed is a maternal uncle of the P. W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury and that he filed Petition Case No. 41 of 2003 against five paternal uncles of the P. W. 2 vis-à-vis the occurrence in the Criminal Court. The P. W. 21 Md. Monjurul Murshed also investigated the said Petition Case as per the direction of the Criminal Court and during investigation, it transpired that there was no bank account in the name of Lovely with Sonali Bank, Kamal Bazar Branch, Biswanath, Sylhet. Rather a bank account stood in the name of the mother-in-law of the deceased Lovely, that is to say, Sundari Bibi Chowdhury (P. W. 10) with Sonali Bank, Kamal Bazar Branch and her two expatriate sons, namely, Shahed Miah Chowdhury and Khaled Miah Chowdhury used to send money to that bank account of Sundari Bibi Chowdhury from time to time and this being the panorama, the certificate of the Bank Manager dated 23.10.2003 (Exhibit-18) is a very material document. Needless to say, Exhibit-18 dated 23.10.2003 belies the defence version of the case.<br/><br/>According to the finding of the learned trial Judge, this is a case under Sections 302/149 of the Penal Code and not a case under Sections 302/34 of the said Code; but shockingly enough, in the operative part of the judgment, he recorded the conviction and sentence of all the accused under Section 302 of the Penal Code only which is ex-facie untenable in law. However, the question whether the instant case comes within the mischief of Sections 302/109 or Sections 302/34 of the Penal Code must be decided.<br/><br/>In the case of Barendra Kumar Ghosh. Vs. .King Emperor reported in AIR 1925 PC 1, the Judicial Committee dealt with the scope of Section 34 of the Penal Code and held thus:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Section 34 deals with the doing of separate acts, similar or diverse, by several persons; if all are done in furtherance of a common intention, each person is liable for the result of them all, as if he had done them himself, for ‘that act’ and ‘the act’ in the latter part of the Section must include the whole action covered by ‘a criminal act’ in the first part, because they refer to it.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The classic case on the subject is the case of Mahbub Shah Vs. King-Emperor, AIR 1945 PC 118. In that case, referring to Section 34 of the Penal Code prior to its amendment in 1870, it was observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“When a criminal act is done by several persons, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act was done by him alone.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It was noticed that by way of amendment, the words “in furtherance of common intention of all” were inserted after the word “persons” and before the word “each” so as to make the object of the Section clear. Dealing with the scope of the Section, as it exists today, it was held therein:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Section 34 lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. The Section does not say ‘the common intention of all’ nor does it say ‘an intention common to all’. Under the Section, the essence of that liability is to be found in the existence of a common intention animating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such intention. To invoke the aid of Section 34 successfully, it must be shown that the criminal act complained against was done by one of the accused persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, if this is shown, then liability for the crime may be imposed on any one of the persons in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone. This being the principle, it is clear to their Lordships that common intention within the meaning of the Section implies a pre-arranged plan, and to convict the accused of an offence applying the Section, it should be proved that the criminal act was done in concert pursuant to the pre-arranged plan. As has been often observed, it is difficult, if not impossible, to procure direct evidence to prove the intention of an individual: in most cases, it has to be inferred from his act or conduct or other relevant circumstances of the case.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of Hassan Vs. The State reported in 1969 SCMR 454, the Supreme Court of Pakistan laid down:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“In order to support a conviction under Section 34 of the Penal Code, mere presence would not be sufficient, but there must be proof of some overt act on the part of each accused done in furtherance of the common intention.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of Abu Sayed and another Vs. .The State reported in 38 DLR (HCD) 17, it was held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“For the applicability of Section 34, it is essential that the act of murder is done by several persons and all the persons who were sought to be made liable by virtue of Section 34 must have done some act and those of the accused who have not taken any part either by word or by action in doing the act of murder can not be made liable under that Section.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Common intention must, also, be proved before a conviction under Section 34 can be made.” <br/>In the case of Muhammad Akbar and two others Vs. The State reported in PLD 1991 SC 923, the observation of their Lordships of the Supreme Court of Pakistan was couched in the following terms:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Mere presence of an accused at the place of incident with a co-accused who commits offence may not be sufficient to visit the former with the vicarious liability, but there should be some strong circumstance manifesting a common intention. Generally common intention, inter alia, precedes by some or all of the following elements, namely, common motive, pre-planned preparation and concert pursuant to such plan.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of Sk. Baharul Islam Vs. The State reported in 11 BLD (HCD) 158, it was stated:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“For the application of Section 34, it must be established first that a criminal act has been done by several persons and secondly that all the participants intended that the criminal act should be done and lastly that the criminal act has been done in furtherance of common intention shared by all the offenders. There must be evidence to show that the accused were present at the scene of occurrence and have actually participated and there must be a pre-concert or pre-arranged plan.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>Inference of common intention within the meaning of Section 34 of the Penal Code should not be readily drawn or pushed too far unless the same is deducible from the evidence and circumstances of the case.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the decision in the case of the State represented by the Solicitor, Ministry of Law &amp; Justice, Government of Bangladesh Vs. Montu alias Nazrul Haque &amp; others reported in 44 DLR (AD) 287 relied on by the learned Deputy Attorney-General Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam, it was held, inter alia, in paragraph 9:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“9. Section 34 lays down the principle of joint liability for doing a criminal act. The essence of the liability is to be found in the existence of common intention animating the accused persons to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of the common intention of them all. “Common intention” of several persons is to be inferred from their conduct, manner of doing the act and the attending circumstances. If one has intention to do any act and others share this intention, their intention becomes “common intention” of them all. And if the act is done in furtherance of the common intention, then all who participated in the act are equally liable for the result of the act………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of Abu Sayed and another Vs. .The State reported in 38 DLR (HCD) 17, it has been held that under Section 34 in case of a criminal act in furtherance of common intention by several persons, each shall be individually liable for the act which he has committed; but under Section 149 every member of the unlawful assembly is guilty of the offence committed in prosecution of the common object. Under Section 34 each of the accused must do some act in furtherance of common intention. For the applicability of Section 34, it is essential that the act of murder is done by several persons and all the persons who were sought to be made liable by virtue of Section 34 must have done some act and those of the accused who have not taken any part either by word or by action in doing the act of murder can not be made liable under that Section. Common intention must, also, be proved before a conviction under Section 34 can be made.<br/><br/>In the case of the State Vs. Idris Pandit and Anu Mia reported in 25 DLR (HCD) 232, it has been held that the ingredients of Section 34 must be fulfilled to justify its application in the absence of which no conviction under Section 34 is valid. The common intention may grow in the course of the event. A common intention or common object is a thing which can not always be proved by direct evidence and it should be inferred from the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case.<br/><br/>The essential constituent of the joint criminal liability prescribed by Section 34 of the Penal Code is common intention. Such common intention, it is well-settled, can be formed even at the spot and it is not necessary that long interval should intervene between the formation and the actual commission of the crime. The common intention is to be inferred from the surrounding facts, circumstances, conduct of the parties and various acts of the accused. In order that intention may be common, the test which is applied is whether intention of one was known to the other and shared by that other. Though common intention implies a pre-arranged plan or concert between persons, it is not necessary that the pre-arranged plan must come into existence before the acts are done. It can come into existence whilst the acts are being committed and can be inferred from such acts (Oswal Danji Tejsi and others….Vs… The State, AIR 1961 Gujarat 16). In a case where the assault is not sudden, common intention should be generally presumed unless there is something to show that there was no opportunity for the accused to have a concert.<br/><br/>The crystallized judicial views that have emerged from the above-mentioned authorities are as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>The distinct feature of Section 34 of the Penal Code is the element of ‘participation in action’;<br/><br/>A common intention pre-supposes prior concert. It requires a pre-arranged plan because before a man can be jointly convicted for the criminal act of another, the act must have been in furtherance of common intention of all of them. Accordingly, there must have been a prior meeting of minds. Unless a common intention is established as a matter of necessary inference from the proved circumstances, the accused person will be liable for his individual act and not for the act done by any other person. For an inference of common intention to be drawn for the purpose of Section 34, the evidence and circumstances of the case should establish without any room for doubt that a meeting of minds and fusion of ideas had taken place amongst different accused and in furtherance of that common intention, overt acts of the accused persons flowed out as if in obedience to the command of a single mind;<br/>Criminal sharing of overt or covert act by active presence or by distant direction making out certain measure of jointness in the commission of the act is the essence of Section 34 of the Penal Code;<br/><br/>A person merely because he was present at or near the scene without doing anything could not and can not be convicted with the aid of Section 34 for the offence committed by other accused persons; and<br/><br/>Common intention of the accused persons to do a criminal act may be formed at the spot even on the spur of the moment.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Section 34 of the Penal Code speaks of common intention while Section 149 of the said Code refers to common object. Besides, Section 149 comes into operation only when there is an unlawful assembly of five or more persons as required by Section 141 and in that view of the matter, it has a wider scope than Section 34. The essence of Section 34 is common intention. Both Sections deal with combination of persons who become punishable as sharers in a crime. The basis of constructive guilt under Section 149 is mere membership of the unlawful assembly while the basis under Section 34 is participation in some action with common intention of committing the crime.<br/><br/>The upshot of the above discussion is that in a case under Sections 302/34 of the Penal Code, all the accused must have participated in the commission of the offence in some form or other while in a case under Sections 302/149, the criminal act might have been committed by a member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of that unlawful assembly. Whether a criminal act is an individual act of an accused or is committed in furtherance of common intention of all the accused or in prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly is a matter to be decided in the facts and circumstances of the case and from the conduct of the accused. In this matter, no strait-jacket formula can be laid down.<br/><br/>It is abundantly clear from the conduct of the accused Ustar and Sohrab that by their active armed presence, they shared the common intention of the accused Mujib and Lechu which was formed at the spot on the spur of the moment when those accused did not find their target at the place of occurrence room, that is to say, P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury. Originally all the twelve accused were animated by common intention to kill the P. W. 1 and in furtherance of that common intention, they went to the place of occurrence. As they missed their target (Fatik Miah Chowdhury), the four accused, namely, Mujib, Sohrab, Ustar and Lechu developed their common intention to kill Lovely and Aklima, two innocent persons and in furtherance of their common intention, they (Lovely and Aklima) were done to death in a cruel manner.<br/><br/>It appears that the accused Shamshad, Selim, Abul Hossain (a confessing accused), Amir Hossain and Amir Ali did not share the common intention of the accused Mujib, Sohrab, Ustar and Lechu in the matter of killing of Lovely and Aklima in that those five accused were outside the place of occurrence room and they did not know what was going on inside that room. In such view of the matter, the question of sharing of the common intention of the accused Mujib, Sohrab, Ustar and Lechu to kill Lovely and Aklima by those five accused is out of the question. Precisely speaking, the accused Shamshad, Selim, Abul Hossain, Amir Hossain and Amir Ali can not be connected with the killing of Lovely and Aklima in furtherance of common intention as contemplated by Section 34 of the Penal Code. Had all the twelve accused succeeded in killing the P. W. 1 Md. Fatik Miah Chowdhury as planned, then those accused would have incurred the criminal liability under Sections 302/34 of the Penal Code. As the accused Shamshad, Selim, Abul Hossain, Amir Hossain and Amir Ali did not share the common intention of the accused Mujib, Sohrab, Ustar and Lechu, they can not be fastened with the criminal liability under Sections 302/34 of the Penal Code. That being so, the accused Shamshad, Selim, Abul Hossain, Amir Hossain and Amir Ali are liable to be acquitted of the charge levelled against them.<br/><br/>According to us, the facts and circumstances of the case and the evidence on record do not attract the mischief of Sections 302/149 of the Penal Code as found by the learned trial Judge in the impugned judgment; rather it is a case under Sections 302/34 of the Penal Code as detailed above. We are taken by surprise at the conviction of all the accused under Section 302 of the Penal Code only in the operative part of the impugned judgment, though it is the definite finding of the learned trial Judge that it is a case under Sections 302/149 of the Penal Code. However, as this finding is an erroneous finding, it is struck down.<br/><br/>In view of what have been discussed above, there is no room for doubt that the accused Mujib, Sohrab, Ustar and Lechu are responsible for the death of Lovely and Aklima. This is why, the submission of Mr. S. M. Shahjahan for awarding the benefit of doubt to the accused Mujib and Lechu stands negatived.<br/><br/>Incidentally, we feel tempted to say that the concept of benefit of doubt as has been understood in our Criminal Jurisprudence signifies reasonable doubt. Can a Court of law reject the substantive and ocular evidence on record and other attending facts and circumstances as in the present case which have been found to be trustworthy on mere grounds which are fanciful or based on conjectures and surmises? In this context, it will be worthwhile to quote a passage from A.I.R 1972 Supreme Court-975 wherein the Supreme Court of India while elaborating the principle of benefit of doubt held in paragraph-6 to the following effect:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The benefit of doubt to which the accused is entitled is reasonable doubt-the doubt which rational-thinking men will reasonably, honestly and conscientiously entertain and not the doubt of a timid mind which fights shy, though unwittingly it may be or is afraid of the logical consequence, if that benefit is not given. The maxim that the prosecution must prove beyond doubt the guilt of the accused or otherwise he is entitled to the benefit of doubt does not mean that the prosecution evidence must be so strong as to exclude even a remote possibility that the accused could not have committed the offence. On the contrary, once the guilt of the accused is established, the mere fact that there is only a remote possibility in favour of the accused is itself sufficient to establish the case beyond all reasonable doubt.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the instant case, in the face of the unimpeachable, untainted and unblemished ocular evidence of the P.W. 2 Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury coupled with the trustworthy evidence of the P. W. 3 Md. Farid Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 4 Md. Manjur Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 5 Kulsuma Begum, P. W. 6 Ayesha Khanom, P. W. 7 Halima Begum, P. W. 8 Md. Monsur Miah Chowdhury, P. W. 9 Rubi Begum and P. W. 10 Sundari Bibi Chowdhury and the medical evidence on record and having regard to the attending circumstances of the case, the question of awarding the benefit of doubt to the accused Mujib and Lechu does not arise at all. As already held, the death of Lovely and Aklima was caused in furtherance of common intention of all the four accused, namely, Mujib, Sohrab, Ustar and Lechu.                                                                          <br/><br/>Now a pertinent question arises as to whether the accused Mujib, Sohrab, Ustar and Lechu are guilty of the offence of culpable homicide amounting to murder or of the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder?<br/>In the case of Bandez Ali alias Md. Bandez Ali Vs. The State reported in 40 DLR (AD) 200, it was held at page 201:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Culpable homicide has been defined in Section 299, and murder in Section 300 of the Penal Code. All ‘murders’ are necessarily ‘culpable homicides,’ but not vice-versa. Culpable homicide is the causing of death by doing any act with the intention of causing death or with the  intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death or with the knowledge that the offender is likely, by such act, to cause death. Culpable homicide becomes murder in any of the four circumstances as stated in Section 300…………………........................ .................................................................................................................................. unless it falls into any of the five Exceptions referred to in Section 300.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of the State represented by the Solicitor to the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh Vs. Ashraf Ali and others reported in 46 DLR (AD) 241, it was observed by our Appellate Division in paragraph 5:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“5. Culpable Homicide in Section 299 is: ‘whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits Culpable Homicide’. Murder has been described in Section 300 of the Penal Code, and without correct understanding of what is ‘Culpable Homicide’, one can not understand what is ‘Murder’. To put it in a simple way, an aggravated form of Culpable Homicide is Murder. In other words, Culpable Homicide falling within any of the four classes of cases specifically described in Section 300 is Murder. All Murders are necessarily Culpable Homicides, but all Culpable Homicides are not Murders, and these cases are termed as ‘Culpable Homicides not amounting to Murders’. Mere killing of a person or mere causing a person’s death is not Murder, Culpable Homicide or even any other criminal offence; but it is so when caused with certain guilty intention or guilty knowledge. Three classes of cases have been described in Section 299 as ‘Culpable Homicide’ and four classes of cases have been described in Section 300 as ‘Murder’. Cases described in class (1) is common in both the two Sections, 299 and 300. That is, when death is caused by an Act ‘done with the intention of causing death’, then it is Murder or Culpable Homicide amounting to Murder. In the other categories of cases as described in both these Sections, the difference between ‘Culpable Homicide’ and ‘Culpable Homicide amounting to Murder’ is the mere degree of probability of the death being caused; when death is probable, it is Culpable Homicide; and when death is most probable, then it is Murder.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Coming back to the present case, the manner of the occurrence as deposed to by the star prosecution witness (P. W. 2) Md. Masud Miah Chowdhury together with the evidence of the P. W. 4 Manjur Miah Chowdhury and P. W. 5 Kulsuma Begum and the medical evidence adduced by the P. W. 20 Dr. M. A. Shahid go to show that the criminal act was done with the intention of causing the death of Lovely and Aklima thus attracting the ingredients of Clause ‘Firstly’ of Section 300 of the Penal Code. This being the state of affairs, the criminal act committed by the accused Mujib, Sohrab, Ustar and Lechu is culpable homicide amounting to murder.<br/><br/>It is a truism that in the criminal justice delivery system, sentencing is the cutting-edge of the judicial process.<br/><br/>In the case of the State Vs. Rokeya Begum alias Rokaya Begum and another (condemned-prisoners) reported in 13 BLT (HCD) 377, it was held in paragraph 51:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“51. Sentencing discretion on the part of a Judge is the most difficult task to perform. It is, also, not possible to lay down any cut and dry formula for imposition of sentence, but the object of sentence should be to see that crime does not go unpunished and the victim of crime as, also, the society has the satisfaction that justice has been done. It will be a mockery of justice to permit the accused to escape the extreme penalty of law when faced with such evidence and cruel act perpetrated by the offenders. To give lesser punishment to the condemned prisoners who stand convicted in a shocking and revolting crime would render the Justicing System of the country suspect. Under sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more harm to Justice System to undermine public confidence in the efficacy of law.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the decision in the case of Madan Gopal Kakkad Vs. Naval Dubey and another reported in 3 SCC (1992) 204, it was observed in paragraph 58:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“58. We feel that Judges who bear the Sword of Justice should not hesitate to use that Sword with the utmost severity, to the full and to the end, if the gravity of the offences so demand.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It is on record that the accused Mujib dealt two dagger blows on the head of Hosne Ara Lovely resulting in her instantaneous death on her cot at the place of occurrence bed-room. Moreover, a mature foetus (nine-month-old) was found killed in the uterus of Lovely. Again the accused Lechu, without rhyme or reason, throttled the infant daughter Aklima to death and threw away her dead body in the pond behind the place of occurrence house. The criminal act appears to be cold-blooded, brutal, gruesome and shocking to our conscience. The circumstances are aggravating and not mitigating or extenuating in so far as the accused Mujib and Lechu are concerned. So we should not hesitate to use the Sword of Justice as regards them with the utmost severity, to the full and to the end. As the remaining two accused, namely, Sohrab and Ustar did not play any major role in the commission of the criminal act, they have been rightly sentenced to imprisonment for life by the Court below.<br/><br/>In a case under Sections 302/34 of the Penal Code when an accused is sentenced to death, he is not awarded any sentence of fine. In the instant case, the death sentence awardees have been sentenced to pay a fine of Tk. 1,000/- each. This sentence of fine awarded to the condemned-prisoners is improper or inapposite, though not illegal. As such, the sentence of fine imposed upon the condemned-prisoners, namely, Mujib Ali and Lechu Meah is knocked down.<br/><br/>The other convictions and sentences recorded against the accused Mujib, Lechu, Sohrab and Ustar under various Sections of the Penal Code are, no doubt, superfluities. So those convictions and sentences are set aside.<br/><br/>In view of what have been discussed above, we do not find any merit in Criminal Appeal Nos. 4263 of 2007, 2018 of 2007, 2244 of 2011, Jail Appeal No. 275 of 2007 and Criminal Appeal No. 2529 of 2007 so far as it relates to the condemned-prisoner Mujib Ali. Those appeals are, therefore, necessarily dismissed. Consequently, we accept the Death Reference and confirm the death sentence imposed upon the condemned-prisoners, namely, Mujib Ali and Lechu Meah @ Kamal Ahmed. The other appeals, that is to say, Criminal Appeal Nos. 1913 of 2007 and 2529 of 2007 so far as it relates to the accused Abul Hossain and Amir Hossain and Jail Appeal Nos. 273 of 2007 and 274 of 2007 are allowed. The impugned judgment stands modified with the findings and observations made in the body of this judgment.<br/><br/>However, the impugned judgment is reversed so far as it relates to the accused Shamshad, Selim, Abul Hossain, Amir Hossain and Amir Ali and the same is maintained so far as it relates to Mujib, Sohrab, Ustar and Lechu.<br/><br/>The accused-appellants Shamshad, Selim, Abul Hossain, Amir Hossain and Amir Ali are acquitted of the charge levelled against them and let them be discharged from their respective bail bonds at once.<br/><br/>The convict-appellant Ustar Ali, son of late Nirmuj Ali of village Nobhagi, Police Station Dakkhin Surma, District- Sylhet is directed to surrender to his bail within 15 (fifteen) days from date in order to serve out the sentence of life-term imprisonment in full, failing which, the Court below will take necessary steps to secure his arrest to that end.<br/><br/>Let the lower Court records along with a copy of this judgment be sent down immediately.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

This being the panorama, we must say that their rock-like evidence puts the prosecution case on a definite foundation and to discre-dit or to dislodge them, the reasonable doubt that must be  created in our mind must be based on the evidence on record itself and not on mere inferences, surmises, speculations and conjectures. . . . (162)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)</strong><br/><strong>Section 164(3)</strong><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 24</strong><br/><strong>It transpires from the confessional statement that the learned confession recording Magistrate meticulously complied with all the mandatory provisions of Section 164(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It also appears from the confessional statement that he did not notice any marks of injury on the person of Masum. Moreover, no suggestion was put either to the P.W. 17 Md. Abul Hossain or to the P.W. 46 Inspector Belal Uddin Chowhdury (Investigating Officer) in their cross-examination on the side of the defence that the confessional statement is a product of police torture or oppression or maltreatment. Over and above, it is the admitted position that the accused Masum did not file any application in the Court for retraction of his confessi-onal statement at any point of time. It does not also appear from the testimony of the P.W. 17 Mr. Md. Abul Hossain that Masum complained of any police torture or oppression to him prior to recording of his confession. On top of that, the learned Magistrate appended a certificate to the confessional statement that it appeared to him that the accused Masum made the confession voluntarily and spontaneously. Against this backdrop, we have no option but to hold that the confessional statement of the condemned-appellant Masum is voluntary. Broadly speaking, the judicial confession of the condemned-appellant Masum stands corroborated by the evidence of the eye-witnesses to the occurrence. In other words, the judicial confession of Masum has been corroborated by the ocular evidence on record in material particulars. This being the position, we feel no hesitation in holding that the confessional statement of Masum is true as well. …(176 – 177)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Explosive Substances Act (VI of 1908)</strong><br/><strong>Section 3 </strong><br/><strong>It is crystal clear that the accused Masum unlawfully or maliciously caused by an explosive substance an explosion of a nature likely to endanger life or to cause serious injury to person or property and because of the bomb explosion, many people were injured and one Mozibul Haque sustained a grievous splinter injury on his person resulting in his death. This being the position, it leaves no room for doubt that the accused Masum committed the offence punishable under Section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act.…(182)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Special Powers Act (XIV of 1974)</strong><br/><strong>Section 27</strong><br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)</strong><br/><strong>Section 537</strong><br/><strong>In the instant case, it is undisputed that no cognizance was taken of the offence against the accused Amzad by the learned Special Tribunal Judge under Section 27 of the Special Powers Act. In the cited decision, the non-taking of cognizance of the offence against the offender, amongst others, was one of the reasons for reversal of his conviction.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Unless cognizance is taken of the offence against him, his subsequent trial, if any, can not be sustainable in law inasmuch as the learned Tribunal Judge did not prima facie hold that there was commission of any offence by him. In such a situation, the trial of the accused shall stand vitiated.</strong><br/><br/><strong>In the present case, the non-taking of cognizance of the offence against the accused Amzad by the concerned Tribunal Judge is admitted. Such being the state of affairs, the non-taking of cognizance of the offence against the accused Amzad on the basis of the supplementary charge-sheet by the concerned Tribunal Judge has vitiated the trial of the case insofar as it relates to him. This illegality is not curable by Section 537 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. So we can not maintain the order of conviction and sentence passed against the accused Amzad. Consequently, the accused Amzad is entitled to acquittal ….(186 – 188)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)</strong><br/><strong>Section 376</strong><br/><strong>The sentence should commensurate with the gravity of the offence. It goes without saying that the criminal act of the condemned-appellant Masum is fiendish, diabolical, heinous and shocking to our conscience. In fact, we do not find any mitigating or extenuating circumstance of a compelling nature for the purpose of commutation of his death sentence; rather all the circumstances are aggravating. In such a landscape, we should not hesitate to use the Sword of Justice with the utmost severity, to the full and to the end. As it is not only a crime against a particular individual but also a crime against the judicial system as a whole as is evident from the confessional statement of Masum and as rightly pointed out by the learned Deputy Attorney-General, the extreme penalty of death, to our mind, will be an appropriate sentence for the commis-sion of the offence by the accused Masum. </strong><br/><br/><strong>It transpires from the impugned judgment that the accused Masum was also awarded a fine of Tk. 1,00,000/- along with the death sentence. It should be borne in mind that imposition of fine on a death sentence awardee is improper or inapposite, though not illegal. So the sentence of fine imposed upon him is set aside.     …(200 – 201)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Explosive Substances Act (VI of 1908)</strong><br/><strong>Section 4(b)</strong><br/><strong>The other order of conviction and sentence recorded against the condemned-prisoner Masum under Section 4(b) of the Explosive Substances Act is, no doubt, a superfluity and that being so, the same is knocked down.…(202)</strong><br/><br/><em>State Vs.

R. Case No. 501 of 2005 corresponding to Lakshmipur Police Station Case No. 01 dated 03.10.2005. By the impugned judgment and order, the Special Tribunal No. 01 convicted the accused-appellant Masumur Rahman @ Masum @ Ahmed under Section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908  and sentenced him thereunder to death and to pay a fine of Tk. 1,00,000/- and also convicted him under Section 4(b) of the said Act and sentenced him thereunder to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 20 years and further convicted  the accused-appellant Amzad Ali @ Mohammad Hossain @ Babu under Sections 3/6 of the said Act and sentenced him thereunder to death and to pay a fine of Tk. 1,00,000/- and also convicted him under Sections 4(b)/6 of the Act and sentenced him thereunder to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 20 years.<br/> <br/>The Special Tribunal No. 1, Lakshmipur also made a Reference to the High Court Division under Sub-section (2) of Section 30 of the Special Powers Act, 1974 for confirmation of the death sentence imposed upon them.<br/> <br/>Both the appeals and the Death Reference have been heard together and are disposed of by this consolidated judgment.<br/> <br/>The prosecution version of the case, in short, is as follows:<br/>         On 03.10.2005, Mr. M. A. Sufian, Joint District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Lakshmipur was hearing cases in open Court and the Court- room was crammed with Advocates, clerks, witnesses, Court support- staff and litigant people. Anyway, at one stage of the Court proceedings, Mr. M. A. Sufian, the Presiding Judge of the Court, noticed a tall young man with a yellow shirt on having a DLR-like book in his hand sitting on a chair amongst the Advocates. As time rolled by, at about 12:00 noon, Mr. M. A. Sufian further noticed that the said young man with the DLR-like book in his hand stood up from the chair, advanced one or two steps forward towards the rostrum of the Court and in the twinkling of an eye, he hurled  the DLR-like book aiming at Mr. M.A. Sufian. The DLR-like book missed the target, hit the table on the rostrum and a bomb concealed in the DLR-like book exploded with a bang scattering splinters all around and injuring many people including the Presiding Judge Mr. M.A. Sufian and damaging the furniture of the Court-room. One Mozibul Haque, a defendant of Title Suit No. 793 of 1981, sustained grievous injuries on his person resulting in ejaculation of his brain-matter as a result of the detonation of the bomb. Eventually Mozibul Haque succumbed to his bomb injuries.  However, the man who hurled the bomb came out of the Court-room in order to make good his escape. The police personnel and people chased him and succeeded in catching hold of him in front of the building of Lakshmipur District Bar Association. On being apprehe-nded, he disclosed his name as Masumur Rahman @ Masum @ Ahmed. Professedly, he is a member of the suicide squad of the militant outfit Jamayatul Muzahedin Bangladesh (JMB). He was assigned with the mission of killing the Judge (Mr. M.A. Sufian) as a part of their blue print to establish Islamic Rule in Bangladesh.  Be that as it may, while the accused Masum was fleeing away from the Court-room, another bomb exploded on the verandah in order to facilitate his escape out of the clutches of the people and police personnel. At the directive  of the  condemned-prisoner Ataur Rahman @ Sunny (since executed),  the condemned-prisoner Amzad Ali @ Moham-mad Hossain @ Babu supplied the bomb to the condemned-prisoner Masumur Rahman @ Masum @ Ahmed  with a view to  killing the Judge concerned by exploding the same so as to fulfill their mission. However, Mr. Md. Bazlur Rahman, Nazir of Lakshmipur Judges-hip, lodged an ejahar with Lakshmipur Police Station, Lakshmipur narrating the occurrence.<br/> <br/>The Investigating Officers of the case are Sub-Inspector Md. Abdus Salam (P.W. 45) and Inspector Belal Uddin Chowdhury (P.W. 46). They investigated the case by visiting the place of occurrence. During investigation, a sketch-map of the place of occurrence along with a separate index was prepared and witnesses were examined and their statements were recorded under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Besides, all the condemned-prisoners made self-inculpatory confessional statements and necessary alamats were seized as per seizure-lists and a copy of the autopsy-report of the deceased Mozibul Haque was obtained. Having found a prima facie case, the second Investigating Officer, that is to say, Inspector Belal Uddin Chowdhury (P.W. 46) submitted charge-sheet no. 221 dated 20.10.2005 against the condemned-prisoner Masumur Rahman under Sections 3/4 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908. Subsequently, the police submitted the relevant supplementary charge-sheet against the remaining two condemned-prisoners, namely, Amzad Ali and Ataur Rahman.<br/> <br/>At the commencement of the trial of the case, the learned trial Judge charged the condemned-prisoner Masumur Rahman under Sections 3/4  of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 and  the other two condemned-prisoners, namely, Amzad Ali and Ataur Rahman  under Sections 3/4/6 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908. The charge was read over and explained to them in the dock; but they pleaded not guilty thereto and claimed to be tried as per law.<br/> <br/>The defence version of the case, as it appears from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses and the statements made by the condemned-prisoners Masumur Rahman and Amzad Ali  at the time of their examination under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, is that they are innocent and have been falsely implicated in the case and their alleged confessional statements are products of police torture, oppression and maltreatment.<br/> <br/>After hearing both the prosecution and the defence and on an appraisal of the evidence and materials on record and having regard to the attending circumstances of the case, the Tribunal below came to the finding that the prosecution brought the charge home against the condemned-prisoners and accordingly, it convicted and sentenced them by the impugned judgment and order as aforesaid.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved at and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order, Masumur Rahman and Amzad Ali have preferred the instant appeals. As already observed, the learned trial Judge has also made a statutory reference to the High Court Division for confirmation of the death sentence imposed upon them.<br/> <br/>At this stage, it may be pointed out that the condemned-prisoner Ataur Rahman was executed on 29.03.2007 in connection with Sessions Case No. 28 of 2006 arising out of Jhalakathi G. R. Case No.  253 of 2005 as is apparent from the order dated 10.06.2012 recorded by this Court. Against this backdrop, the Death Reference so far as it relates to the condemned-prisoner Ataur Rahman has become infructuous as a matter of course.<br/> <br/>The only point for determination in the appeals and the Death Reference is whether the impugned judgment and order dated 15.08.2006 is sustainable in law or not?<br/> <br/>Mr. Syed Mizanur Rahman, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the condemned-appellant Masum, submits that his alleged self-inculpatory confessional statement dated 13.10.2005 (Exhibit-15)  is a product of police torture and oppression, but the Tribunal failed to properly appreciate this dimension of the case resulting in a miscarriage of justice.<br/> <br/>Mr. Syed Mizanur Rahman also submits that since the accused Masum has been convicted under Section 302 of the Penal Code and sentenced thereunder to death, his conviction and sentence under Section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act arising out of the self-same transaction is hit by Section 26 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 and that being so, there is no scope for his prosecution under Section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act; but the learned Tribunal Judge failed to consider this aspect of the case resulting in grave prejudice to the accused Masum.<br/> <br/>Mr. Syed Mizanur Rahman next submits that virtually  he has nothing to say about the ocular evidence of the prosecution witnesses concerned;  but he makes a prayer  to this Court to  commute  the death sentence of Masum to imprisonment for life on the ground of his tender age  and long pendency of the Death Reference in the High Court Division in view of the decisions in the cases of The State -Vs- Jahangir Mallik, 15 BLC (HCD) 67; The State -Vs- Abdul Karim alias Gonesh and others, 8 BLC (HCD) 264; The State -Vs- Md. Shahjahan alias Babu,  7 BLC (HCD) 602; The State -Vs- Yeasin Khan Palash and 4 others, 12 BLC (HCD) 631;The State -Vs- Saidul and others, 13 BLC (HCD) 739; The State -Vs- Silbestar Roy alias Tito alias Noorzzaman, 13 BLC (HCD) 287;The State -Vs- Md. Monir Mridha and others, 14 BLC (HCD) 532; The State -Vs- Anowar  Hossain Pinto alias Anowar Hossain and another, 61 DLR (AD) 108 and The State -Vs- Md. Shamim alias Shamim Sikder and others, 53 DLR(HCD) 439.<br/> <br/>Mr. Junayed Ahmed Chowdhury, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of Advocate Mr. Md. Anisur Rahman Hatem for the condemned-appellant Amzad Ali, submits that there is nothing on record to show that cognizance of the offence was taken against Amzad Ali by the concerned Special Tribunal Judge under Section 27 of the Special Powers Act on the basis of the supplementary charge-sheet no. 86 dated 14.05.2006 and as no cognizance was taken against Amzad, the entire trial as against him stands vitiated.<br/> <br/>Mr. Junayed Ahmed Chowdhury further submits that the non-taking of cognizance against Amzad is not curable by Section 537 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and in this view of the matter, the learned trial Judge erred in law in convicting and sentencing the condemned-appellant Amzad.<br/> <br/>In support of the above submission, Mr. Junayed Ahmed Chowdhury relies upon the decision in the case of Abdullah Shah and others -Vs- The State reported in PLD 1962 (WP) Karachi 633 (paragraph 4).<br/> <br/>On the other hand, Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam, learned Deputy Attorney-General appearing on behalf of the State-respondent and in support of the Death Reference, submits that the evidence of the eye-witnesses, namely, the P.W. 1 Md. Bazlur Rahman, P.W. 3 Advocate Md. Nur Nabi, P.W. 5 Md. Shafiq Ullah (Bench Assistant),  P.W. 6  Advocate Azgar Hossain Mahmud,  P.W. 7 Advocate Saibal Kanti Saha, P.W. 10 Advocate Zahidul Islam,  P.W. 11 Advocate Ratan Lal Bhowmik,  P.W. 12  Advocate Makhan Lal Saha,  P.W. 13  Shahid Ali Rarri (defendant no. 21 of Title Suit No.793 of 1981),  P.W. 15  Delwar Hossain Patwary,  P.W. 16 Idris Ali,  P.W. 23  Md. Monzil Hossain (Constable on duty), P.W. 26  Advocate Md. Shahid Hossain, P.W. 28  Advocate Tasaddek Uddin Ahmed Chowdhury, P.W. 30  Peon Nur Nabi,  P.W. 31  Mr. M. A. Sufian (Presiding Judge of the Court),  P.W. 33 Sub-Inspector Parimal Chandra Das,  P.W. 39 Constable  No. 598 Md. Alamgir Hossain,  P.W. 40  Md. Anowar Hossain and  P.W. 44 Constable No. 134 Md. Abdul Alim coupled with the medical evidence on record  have proved the prosecution version of the case to the hilt  and  viewed from this standpoint, it is crystal clear that the learned trial Judge rightly convicted and sentenced the condemned-appellant Masum.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam next submits that the offences punishable under Section 302 of the Penal Code and under Section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act are distinct and separate offences and in such view of the matter, the provisions of Section 26 of the General Clauses Act can not be invoked.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam also submits that the self-inculpatory confessional statements of Masum and Amzad are not the products of police torture or oppression or maltreatment; rather they made the confessions spontaneously under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the confessions having been found to be true and voluntary, the trial Court rightly relied upon them in conjunction with the ocular evidence on record.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam, however, finds it difficult to assail the submission of Mr. Junayed Ahmed Chowdhury that the trial of the case so far as it relates to the condemned-prisoner Amzad stands vitiated for not taking cognizance of the offence on the basis of the supplementary charge-sheet no. 86 dated 14.05.2006; but he says that this was an inadvertent mistake committed by the learned Tribunal Judge.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam next submits that the offence committed by the condemned-prisoner Masum is very heinous and brutal and it was perpetrated not against any particular individual, but against the State, social structure and the Judiciary and in that view of the matter, there is no scope for commutation of the death sentence of Masum to life-term imprisonment. In this regard, Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam draws our attention to the decisions in the cases of Abdul Khaleque Mir -Vs- .The State, 2 BLT (AD) 172 and Islamuddin (Md) @ Din Islam -Vs- .The State, 13 BLC (AD) 81.<br/> <br/>We have heard the submissions of the learned Advocates Mr. Syed Mizanur Rahman and Mr. Junayed Ahmed Chowdhury and the counter-submissions of the learned Deputy Attorney-General Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam.<br/> <br/>With a view to arriving at a correct decision in the appeals as well as in the Death Reference, we are to advert to and scrutinize the relevant evidence and attending circumstances by way of juxtaposing both the prosecution and the defence versions of the case.  <br/> <br/>At the trial, the prosecution has examined 46 (forty-six) witnesses in all on its side. But the defence has examined none.<br/> <br/>Anyway, the informant Md. Bazlur Rahman has examined himself as P.W. 1 in the case. He deposes that he has been posted as Nazir of Lakshmipur Judgeship, Lakshimpur and on 03.10.2005 at 12:00 noon, Mr. M.A. Sufian, Presiding Judge of the 1<sup>st</sup> Court of  Joint District Judge, Lakshmipur along with his Bench Assistant Md. Shafiq Ullah and others was injured in bomb explosion at the time of Court proceedings and when the bomb-thrower started running away from the place of occurrence, the police personnel and people apprehended him and one of the injured persons was declared  dead when he was taken to Lakshmipur Sadar Hospital for treatment.<br/> <br/>The P.W. 1 Md.

The main thrust of his testimony is that on 14.10.2005, he was on duty at Bandar Police Station, Narayanganj and on receipt of an inquiry slip being no. 4/05 dated 14.10.2005 from the Detective Branch of Lakshmipur District, the Officer-in-Charge of Bandar Police Station endorsed it to him for inquiry and he verified the antecedents of the accused Masum as per inquiry slip.<br/> <br/>The P.W. 44 is Constable No. 134 Abdul Alim.  He deposes that on 03.10.2005, he was on duty at the ejlash of the 1<sup>st</sup> Court of  Joint District Judge, Lakshmipur and at about 12:00 noon, he saw that a young man hurled a voluminous book towards the Joint District Judge M.A. Sufian and it hit the table, fell down near the Judicial Chair and a bomb concealed therein exploded with a bang and that young man ran away from the ejlash immediately  after the bomb explosion and then and there another bomb was detonated on the verandah and he along with the police and the crowd chased the young man and at one stage, the young man  doffed his yellow  shirt and threw it away so that he could not be identified  by anybody; but he (P.W. 44 ) and  the Joint District Judge M.A. Sufian identified the bomb-thrower young man and apprehended him in front of the building of the District Bar Association  and the apprehended man disclosed his name as Masum.<br/> <br/>The P.W. 44 Constable No. 134 Abdul Alim also deposes that he was also injured in the bomb explosion and admitted to Lakshmipur Sadar Hospital for treatment.<br/> <br/>The P.W. 44 Constable No. 134 Abdul Alim identifies the accused Masum in the dock. In his cross-examination, the P.W. 44 Constable No. 134 Abdul Alim denies a defence suggestion that he did not see the accused Masum hurling the bomb in the Court-room.<br/> <br/>The P.W. 45 is Sub-Inspector Md.

He testifies that on 03.10.2005,  he was on duty at Lakshmipur Police Station and having taken up investigation of the case, he visited the place of occurrence, prepared a sketch-map thereof along with a separate index and on 04.10.2005, he seized a copy of the CD as submitted by Tapash and also seized five copies of still photographs of the place of occurrence from one Pintu Majumdar, examined four witnesses and recorded their statements under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure  and on that day (04.10.2005),  he handed over the case diary to the Detective Branch.<br/> <br/>In his cross-examination, the P.W. 45 Sub-Inspector Md. Abdus Salam denies a defence suggestion that he did not investigate the case properly.<br/> <br/>The P.W. 46 is Inspector Belal Uddin Chowdhury. He deposes that on 04.10.2005, he was on duty as Officer-in-Charge of Lakshmipur Detective Branch and on that day, as per the order of the Superintendent of Police, Lakshmipur, he took over the investigation of the case, visited the place of occurrence, examined witnesses and recorded their statements under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/> <br/>The P.W. 46 Inspector Belal Uddin Chowdhury also deposes that at the showing of the accused Masum, he seized six Islamic books, one circuit, two torch-lights, two old Olympic batteries and other articles from his house at Chandpur Town.<br/> <br/>The P.W. 46 Inspector Belal Uddin Chowdhury further deposes that he sent the alamats of bomb explosion to the explosive expert, procured  copies of the autopsy-report of the deceased Mozibul Haque and the self-inculpatory confessional statement of the accused Masum and having found a prima facie case, he submitted the relevant charge-sheet against the accused Masum.<br/> <br/>The P.W. 46 Inspector Belal Uddin Chowdhury next deposes that subsequently he submitted supplementary charge-sheet against the accused Amzad and Sunny.<br/> <br/>In his cross-examination, the P.W. 46 Inspector Belal Uddin Chowdhury denies a defence suggestion that he did not investigate the case in a proper manner.<br/> <br/>At this juncture, it will not be out of place to mention that the examination report dated 11.10.2005 made by the Chief Explosive Inspector Mr. Nurul Alam has been admitted in evidence under Section 510 of the Code of Criminal Procedure  and marked Exhibit-24 on the side of the prosecution. His opinion as contained in Exhibit-24 runs as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“উপরোক্তর অনুচ্ছেদে বর্ণিত লোহার তৈরী চাক্তি, লোহার সর্র দন্ড ও লোহার ভাঙ্গা টুকরা ইত্যাদি পর্যবেক্ষণে আলামতগুলি দৃশ্যত বিস্ফোরিত বোমার  ধবংসাবশেষ বলিয়া প্রতীয়মান হয়।  পুরো লোহার পাত ছিন্ন-বিচ্ছিন্ন হওয়ার প্রেক্ষিতে প্রতীয়মান হয় যে, সংশ্নিষ্ট বোমা বেশ শক্তিশালী ছিল। তবে, কোন রাসায়নিক পদার্থ না পাওয়ায় বিস্ফোরকটি কোন শ্রেণীর তাহা নির্ণয় করা যায় নাই। তাহাছাড়া কসটেপ, ব্যাটারী, বৈদ্যুতিক তার, সার্কিট ইত্যাদি আলামতগুলি বৈদ্যুতিকভাবে বিস্ফোরণ ঘটানোর প্রক্রিয়ার সহায়ক বৈদ্যুতিক সরনজ্ঞামাদি বলিয়া মনে হয়।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Out of 46(forty-six) prosecution witnesses, the star prosecution witnesses appear to be the  P.W. 1  Md. Bazlur Rahman,  P.W. 3  Advocate Md. Nur Nabi, P.W. 5  Md. Shafiq Ullah,  P.W. 6  Advocate Azgar Hossain Mahmud,  P.W. 7 Advocate Saibal Kanti Saha,  P.W. 10 Advocate Zahidul Islam,  P.W. 11  Advocate Ratan Lal Bhowmik,  P.W. 12 Advocate Makhan Lal Saha,  P.W. 13  Shahid Ali Rarri,  P.W. 15  Delwar Hossain,  P.W. 16 Idris Ali,  P.W. 23  Md. Monzil Hossain,  P.W. 26  Advocate Md. Shahid Hossain,  P.W. 28  Advocate Tasaddek Uddin Ahmed Chowdhury,  P.W. 30 Peon Nur Nabi,  P.W. 31  M. A. Sufian, injured Presiding Officer of the 1<sup>st</sup> Court of Joint District Judge, Lakshmipur, P.W. 39 Constable  Md. Alamgir Hossain,  P.W. 40  Md. Anwar Hossain and  P.W. 44 Constable Md. Abdul Alim. Excepting the P.W. 3 Advocate Md. Nur Nabi, all the afore-mentioned prosecution witnesses eye-witnessed the hurling of the bomb concealed inside a DLR-like book towards the P.W. 31 M. A. Sufian while he was hearing a petition arising out of Title Suit No. 793 of 1981. It may be pointed out that while the P.W. 3 Md. Nur Nabi was moving the petition at the material time, the bomb was hurled from behind and as such he could not see the face of the bomb- thrower. The eye-witness account of the prosecution witnesses concerned appears to be very vivid, pictorial and graphic. They have given a blow-by-blow account of the occurrence leading to the eventual apprehension of the bomb-thrower Masum. As a matter of fact, the time, place and manner of the occurrence are not disputed by the defence.  The main thrust of the contention of the defence is that Masum did not hurl the bomb at the place of occurrence and his alleged confessional statement is a product of police torture, oppression and maltreatment.<br/> <br/>Out of the eye-witnesses, the evidence of the P.W. 31 M.A. Sufian appears to be very vital. He himself sustained injuries on his person in the bomb explosion at his ejlash. Ostensively he was the target of the bomb attack of Masum. It is in his evidence that when the accused Masum hurled the bomb aiming at him, he (P.W. 31) tilted his chair to some extent in order to save himself from the bomb attack and the bomb hit the table on the rostrum, fell down and exploded with a bang causing damage to the furniture and records of the Court and resulting in injuries to many persons.<br/> <br/>It is evident from the relevant testimony on record that the learned Presiding Judge M.A. Sufian (P.W. 31) himself got down from the ejlash and he along with others started chasing the bomb-thrower Masum and at one stage, they succeeded in catching hold of Masum in front of the building of Lakshmipur District Bar Association in co-operation with the police and the crowd.  All the eye-witnesses have stated in chorus that the accused Masum hurled the bomb aiming at the P.W. 31 M.A. Sufian and it detonated with a bang causing damage to the furniture and records of the Court, as already mentioned. It does not stand to reason and logic as to why they will falsely implicate the accused Masum. There is nothing on record to show that the eye-witnesses have   any animus or ill-feeling against the accused Masum; rather the evidence on record unerringly shows that Masum was not known to them prior to the occurrence. So the question of false implication of the accused Masum in the commission of the offence, as we see it, is out of the question.<br/> <br/>The identity of the accused Masum, it transpires, has been firmly established by the evidence of the star prosecution witnesses. In this regard, the evidence of the P.W. 31 M. A. Sufian and other witnesses concerned is very weighty.  It is in the evidence on record that immediately after the explosion in the Court-room, Masum started running away therefrom by doffing his yellow shirt in order to avoid identification by the people; but the P.W. 31 M. A. Sufian and others could identify him beyond any shadow of doubt and ultimately they tracked him down in collaboration with the police and the crowd. The attempt of the defence to create a sort of smokescreen as regards the identity of the accused Masum falls through.<br/> <br/>On a critical analysis of the ocular evidence of the star prosecution witnesses, we do not find any omissions, inconsistencies or contradictions on any material aspect concerning the occurrence between their examination-in-chief and cross-examination. This being the panorama, we must say that their rock-like evidence puts the prosecution case on a definite foundation and to discredit or to dislodge them, the reasonable doubt that must be  created in our mind must be based on the evidence on record itself and not on mere inferences, surmises, speculations and conjectures.<br/> <br/>We have put the direct evidence of the P.W. 1 Md. Bazlur Rahman,  P.W. 3  Advocate Md. Nur Nabi,  P.W. 5  Md. Shafiq Ullah,  P.W. 6  Advocate Azgar Hossain Mahmud,  P.W. 7  Advocate Saibal Kanti Saha,  P.W. 10 Advocate Zahidul Islam,  P.W. 11 Advocate Ratan Lal Bhowmik,  P.W. 12  Advocate Makhan Lal Saha,  P.W. 13  Shahid Ali Rarri,  P.W. 15  Delwar Hossain,  P.W. 16 Idris Ali,  P.W. 23  Md. Monzil Hossain,  P.W. 26  Advocate Md. Shahid Hossain,  P.W. 28  Advocate Tasaddek Uddin Ahmed Chowdhury,  P.W. 30  Peon Nur Nabi,  P.W. 31  M. A. Sufian,  P.W. 39  Md. Alamgir Hossain,  P.W. 40  Md. Anwar Hossain and  P.W. 44  Constable Abdul Alim  to the closest scrutiny as is required by law and found the same to be quite trustworthy, unblemished, unimpeach-able, impeccable and invincible. In their evidence, the substantive part touching upon the factum of the occurrence and its manner, method and sequence have not been shaken, deviated from or rendered doubtful in their cross-examination. The defence has failed to make any headway in this respect.<br/> <br/>It appears that the evidence of the star prosecution witnesses has a natural flow and the same is not at all laboured in character. They have dourly stood their ground. Their evidence, so to say, is impregnable. That being so, we opine that their ocular evidence excludes the possibility of any inference of fabrication, concoction, tutoring and rehearsal.<br/> <br/>It is an indisputable fact that one Mozibul Haque was grievously injured in the bomb explosion at the ejlash of the 1<sup>st</sup> Court of Joint District Judge, Lakshmipur and he succumbed to bomb injuries. The P.W. 9 Dr. Md. Salah Uddin Sharif held an autopsy on the deceased Mozibul Haque. It is the opinion of the P.W. 9 Dr. Md. Salah Uddin Sharif that the death of Mozibul Haque was due to haemorrhagic shock because of  splinter injury on account of bomb  blast which was ante-mortem and homicidal in nature. The evidence of Dr. Md. Salah Uddin Sharif (P.W. 9) seems to be confirmatory of the cause of death of Mozibul Haque. So there is no room for any doubt that Mozibul Haque was grievously injured in the bomb explosion in the Court-room resulting in his death. Besides, the report of the Chief Explosive Inspector dated 11.10.2005 (Exhibit-24) lends support to the bomb explosion that took place in the Court- room. Moreover, the seizure of the alamats (Exhibits-3, 4 and 5) and the attending circumstances of the case bear out the bomb explosion at the place of occurrence. Nor is this all, the sketch-map pinpoints the ejlash of the 1<sup>st</sup> Court of Joint District Judge, Lakshmipur as the place of bomb explosion.<br/> <br/>The accused Masum is a confessing accused. His confession dated 13.10.2005 has been admitted in evidence and marked Exhibit-15 on the side of the prosecution. We must ascertain as to whether the judicial confession of Masum is true and voluntary or otherwise. There are certain criteria for assessing the worth of a judicial confession.<br/> <br/>In the case of Habibur Rahman @ Habib -Vs- The State reported in 8 BLD (HCD) 210, it was observed in paragraph 15:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“15………………………………………….……………………………<br/>Before a Court acts upon a confessional statement, it has to affirmatively satisfy that the statement is voluntary and true. In this regard, the judicial authorities always insist on the meticulous observance of all necessary formalities and precautions provided in Section 164 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure with minute particularity so as to ensure that the confession is absolutely free from the slightest tinge or taint of extraneous influence. ‘It is a settled principle of law’ as pointed out by a Division Bench of this Court in the case of Zaheda Bewa and another -Vs- The State reported in 1985 BLD 9 ‘that the requirement of adherence to the provisions of Section 164 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not a mere matter of form, but of substance. Section 164 (3) is a mandatory provision of law as has been settled by the Privy Council in the case of Nazir Ahmed -Vs- The King Emperor, AIR 1936 P.C 253’. Before recording a confession, a Magistrate is bound to make a real and substantial enquiry as to the voluntariness of the confession. In so doing, he must put questions to the accused with a view to finding out the real object of the confession, whether it is made out of repentance or for any other such good reason or whether it is the result of torture or tutoring by some body or whether it has been caused by any inducement, threat or promise. The questions put by the Magistrate and the answers given by the accused furnish sufficient data for coming to the conclusion whether the statement was voluntary or not.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the decision in the case of Abul Hossain and others -Vs- The State reported in 13 BLD (HCD) 311, it has been held, inter alia, in paragraph 7 that Sub-Section (3) of Section 164 speaks of the manner as to how the confession of an accused is to be recorded by a Magistrate and this is a mandatory provision and failure to comply therewith shall make the confession invalid and unreliable. It has been further held therein that this provision of law together with the provisions of Section 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure require to be strictly observed and followed to make the confession voluntary and true in the real sense to be fit for reliance for convicting an accused on his confession.<br/> <br/>In the case of Nurul Haque and another -Vs- The State reported in 20 DLR (HCD) 780, it was observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Before recording the confession, it must be explained to the accused that he is not bound to make a confession and if he makes a confession, it may be used as evidence against him. It is a mandatory provision of law. No Magistrate should record any confession unless, upon putting questions to the accused, he has reason to believe that the confession was made voluntarily. Any defect arising out of violation of any mandatory provision of law is not curable under Section 533 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>A reference may be made to the decision reported in 1986 (BLD) 436 (Ali Asgar and another -Vs- The State). In the said decision at page 438, it was held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Now let us consider the value of a retracted confession as against the maker. On consideration of evidence on record, if it is found that a confession is voluntary and true, conviction of the maker himself can solely be based upon the same, no matter whether it is retracted or not. In the case of the State -Vs- Minbun alias Gul Hassan reported in 16 DLR (Supreme Court) page 598, their Lordships of the Supreme Court held as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>‘As against the maker himself, his confession, judicial or extra-judicial, whether retracted, or not retracted, can in law validly form the sole basis of his conviction. So we are also of the opinion that a confession, if proved true and voluntary, can be the sole basis for conviction of the maker of the confession.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of the State -Vs- Punardhar Joydhar alias Kudu and Shefali reported in 31 DLR (HCD) 312, it has been held that the accused first made a confessional statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure that he committed that murder, although subsequently he retracted his confessional statement before the Court and the confession being found voluntary and without any threat, coercion or inducement, conviction of the accused based on his confession, though subsequently retracted by him, is valid in law.<br/> <br/>The principle that has been enunciated in the case of Hazrat Ali and another -Vs- The State reported in 1990 BLD (HCD) 38 is that once a confession has been found to be true and voluntary, conviction can be based solely on the confession, even if it is retracted.<br/> <br/>The ‘ratio decidendi’ of the case of Bakul Chandra Sarkar -Vs- The State reported in 45 DLR (HCD) 260 is that if a confession recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is true and voluntary, the same alone is sufficient for convicting the confessing accused and retraction of confession is immaterial, once it is found to be true and voluntary.<br/> <br/>Keeping the aforesaid principles in view, let us address and consider the inculpatory confessional statement of the condemned-prisoner Masum (Exhibit-15).<br/> <br/>The relevant portion of Exhibit-15 is to the following effect:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“গত ০১.১০.২০০৫ তারিখ ও ০২.১০.২০০৫  তারিখ আমি লক্ষিপুর জজ কোর্ট গিয়ে কোর্টের এজলাসগুলো দেখে আসি।  ঐ দুদিন সকাল ১০.০০ টায় কোর্টগুলো দেখে আনুমানিক ১ ঘটিকা থাকার পর চলে যাই। ০২.১০.২০০৫ তারিখ রাতে কামরুল সকলকে নিয়ে বসে আমাকে বলে তোমাকে একটা অপারেশনে যেতে হবে। রাতে হোসেন ওরফে বাবু, হাজ্ঞালা, জুয়েল তাদের বেডিংপত্র বেঁধে ফেলে ও ৩/১০/২০০৫ তারিখ সকালে নামাজ পড়ে বেডিং সহ চলে যায়। কামরুল ও তাদের সাথে রুম হতে চলে যায় এবং আধা ঘন্টা পর ২ টি ব্যাগ হাতে কামরুল ঘরে প্রবেশ করে বলে ২ টি ব্যাগে ২ টি বোমা যা বই এর মত দেখতে। কামরুল আমাকে বলে যে, বোমার ১ টি লাল ফিতা আছে। উক্ত ফিতা টান দিয়ে নিক্ষেপ করার পর বোমাটি বিস্ফোরিত হবে। সে আমাকে আরো বলে যে, দৌড়ে পালানোর সময় কেহ ধাওয়া করলে তোমার পরনের শার্ট ও জুতা খুলে দোঁড় দিবে। গত ৩/১০/২০০৫ তারিখ সকাল ৮.০০ টার সময় ১ টি বইয়ের মতো বোমা আমার হাতে কামরুল দেয় এবং বোমাটি ১২.০০ টার সময় জজ সাহেবের টেবিলের মধ্যে ফিতা টেনে ছুঁড়ে মারার জন্য বলে। আমি বোমা সহ পরিকল্পনা অনুযায়ী সকাল ৮.১৫ মিনিটের সময় আদালতের সম্মুখের রাস্তার পার্শ্বে অবস্থান করতে থাকি। অন্য বোমাটি কামরুল কোথায় নিয়ে গেছে তা জানিনা। আমার ঘড়িতে ১২ টা বাজার ১৫ মিনিট পূর্বে আমি জজ কোর্টে বিচার চলাকালে পিছনের বেঞ্চে গিয়ে বসি। ঐ বেঞ্চেই আমার পাশে একজন বৃদ্ধ লোক বসা ছিল। বেলা ১২.০০ টায় বোমার সাথে সংযুক্তর লাল ফিতাটি টান দিয়ে বই এর মতো দেখতে বোমাটি জজ সাহেব যে টেবিলে বসে বিচার কার্যএ্রম চালায় ঐ টেবিলের দিকে বোমাটি নিক্ষেপ করি। বোমাটি নিক্ষেপ করার পর পরই দরজা দিয়ে সহান হতে দৌড় দিয়ে পালানোর চেষ্টা করলে জনতা ও পুলিশ বোমা নিক্ষেপকারী হিসেবে আমাকে চিহ্রিত করে আমাকে ধাওয়া করলে আমি আমার পরনের হলুদ/ টিয়া রংয়ের ফুলহাতা শার্ট খুলে ফেলি এবং পায়ের সেন্ডেল খুলে দৌঁড় দিলে পুলিশ ও জনতা আমাকে ধরে ফেলে। সে সময় আমি আরেকটি বোমা বিস্ফোরনের শব্দ শুনতে পাই। বোমা বিস্ফোরনের সময় আমাকে কামরুল বলেছিল যে, তুই ধরা পড়লে তোকে রক্ষা করার জন্য আরেকজন আছে। আমার পালানোর সুবিধার জন্য ২য় বোমাটি ফাটানো হয়েছিল। পুলিশ আমাকে গ্রেপ্তারের পর জানতে  পারি যে, বোমার আঘাতে একজন বৃদ্ধ লোক হাসপাতালে চিকিৎসাধীন অবসহায় মারা গেছে ও অনেকে গুরুতরভাবে আহত হয়েছে। আল্লাহর আইন ছাড়া মানুষের তৈরী প্রচলিত আইন অনুযায়ী যারা বিচার কার্যক্রম করে তারা কাফের। বিচারককে শেষ করার উদ্দেশ্যেই তার উপর বোমা নিক্ষেপ করেছিলাম।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It transpires from the confessional statement (Exbibit-15) that the learned confession recording Magistrate Mr. Md. Abul Hossain (P.W. 17) meticulously complied with all the mandatory provisions of Section 164(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It also appears from Exhibit-15 that he did not notice any marks of injury on the person of Masum. Moreover, no suggestion was put either to the P.W. 17 Md. Abul Hossain or to the P.W. 46 Inspector Belal Uddin Chowhdury (Investigating Officer) in their cross-examination on the side of the defence that Exibit-15 is a product of police torture or oppression or maltreatment. Over and above, it is the admitted position that the accused Masum did not file any application in the Court for retraction of his confessional statement at any point of time. It does not also appear from the testimony of the P.W. 17 Mr. Md. Abul Hossain that Masum complained of any police torture or oppression to him prior to recording of his confession. On top of that, the P.W. 17 Md. Abul Hossain appended a certificate to Exhibit-15 that it appeared to him that the accused Masum made the confession voluntarily and spontaneously. Against this backdrop, we have no option but to hold that the confessional statement of the condemned-appellant Masum (Exhibit-15) is voluntary.   <br/> <br/>Broadly speaking, the judicial confession of the condemned-appellant Masum stands corroborated by the evidence of the eye-witnesses to the occurrence. In other words, the judicial confession of Masum has been corroborated by the ocular evidence on record in material particulars. This being the position, we feel no hesitation in holding that the confessional statement of Masum is true as well.<br/> <br/>The defence version of the case that the accused Masum is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the case and his alleged confessional statement is the product of police torture, oppression and maltreatment does not receive any indication or support from the evidence and materials on record and attending circumstances of the case. So the defence version of the case is a downright falsehood. It is like-‘A drowning man catches at a straw’.<br/> <br/>From the discussions made above, it has been conclusively proved that the accused Masum detonated the bomb at the ejlash of the 1<sup>st</sup> Court of Joint District Judge, Lakshmipur at the material time. It appears from the tone and tenor of his confessional statement that they (Masum and other JMB activists) wanted to establish the Rule of Allah by implementing Islamic Law. However, we have already found that as a result of the bomb explosion, one Mozibul Haque died and many people including the Presiding Judge M.A. Sufian (P.W.31) were injured.<br/> <br/>In this perspective, a pertinent question arises: does Islam support killing of innocent people by means of bomb explosion or other means of violence to establish the Rule of Allah through implementation of Islamic Law in this country? The answer is obviously in the negative. In this context, we feel tempted to advert to the decision in the case of Iftekhar Hasan (Md) @ Al Mamun and others -Vs- ..The State reported in 59 DLR(AD)36. In that decision, it was observed in paragraph 83:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“83. Islam is a religion of peace. It is derived from the word “Salam” meaning peace. Using the holy name of Islam, the petitioners have engaged in a wild mad struggle jeopardizing the law and order of the country resulting in killing of innocent people as has been done in the present case of killing the two Judges. Does Islam permit killing of such innocent persons? Are those ill-fated Judges responsible for not implementing Islamic law in this country?  Is it the job of the Judges to legislate Islamic law in Bangladesh? Is there even any allegation against them of murdering any other persons or any adversary or being themselves Murtad? Islam does not encourage use of force in the matter of religion. The way the petitioners resorted to outrageous atrocities in the name of Islam killing innocent persons has been prohibited clearly in Islam. The Quran says “……….. whosoever kills a human being for other than manslaughter or corruption in the earth, it shall be as if he had killed all mankind, and whosoever saveth the life of one, it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind……” Sura 5:Al Maidah: 32.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Reverting to the case in hand, although the Joint District Judge M.A. Sufian (P.W. 31) was the target of the unlawful or malicious bomb attack, he escaped death narrowly and one of the litigants, namely, Mozibul Haque having been grievously injured died owing to the bomb explosion.  <br/> <br/>From the discussions made above and in view of the facts and circumstances of the case, it is crystal clear that the accused Masum unlawfully or maliciously caused by an explosive substance an explosion of a nature likely to endanger life or to cause serious injury to person or property and because of the bomb explosion, many people were injured and one Mozibul Haque sustained a grievous splinter injury on his person resulting in his death. This being the position, it leaves no room for doubt that the accused Masum committed the offence punishable under Section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act.<br/> <br/>Section 26 of the General Clauses Act contemplates  that where an act or omission constitutes an offence under two or more enactments, then the offender shall be liable to be prosecuted and punished under either or any of those enactments, but shall not be liable to be punished twice for the same offence. But the offence punishable under Section 302 of the Penal Code and the offence punishable under Section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act are not one and the same; rather they are distinct and separate offences. As they are distinct and separate offences, Mr. Syed Mizanur Rahman can not invoke the aid of Section 26 of the General Clauses Act.<br/> <br/>At this juncture, let us address the submission of Mr. Junayed Ahmed Chowdhury that the non-taking of cognizance of the offence against the accused Amzad on the basis of the supplementary charge-sheet by the learned Special Tribunal Judge under Section 27 of the Special Powers Act has vitiated the trial of the case in so far as he is concerned. It may be recalled that the accused Amzad is also a confessing accused. His confession is inculpatory in nature.  According to the purport of his confession, he abetted the commission of the offence.<br/> <br/>However, in the decision in the case of The Crown -Vs- Pirdhan Rautamall &amp; Co. represented by Matilal Mulgulia reported in 2 DLR 304 relied on by Mr. Junayed Ahmed Chowdhury, it was held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“It is difficult to comprehend under what provision of law the learned Sub-Divisional Officer believed himself  to be acting when after calling on the petitioner to show cause why he should not be prosecuted and on his showing cause, convicted him without any further ado, without  taking cognizance of the offence and without taking any action under  Chapter XVII or  Chapter XX  of the Code of Criminal Procedure, without respecting the provisions of Section 190(C), without recording any evidence and without following any recognized procedure for trial. Clearly the conviction can not possibly be maintained and must be set aside.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the instant case, it is undisputed that no cognizance was taken of the offence against the accused Amzad by the learned Special Tribunal Judge under Section 27 of the Special Powers Act. In the aforesaid decision, the non-taking of cognizance of the offence against the offender, amongst others, was one of the reasons for reversal of his conviction.<br/> <br/>Now a billion-dollar question arises: what legal consequences will ensue for not taking cognizance of the offence against the accused Amzad on the basis of the supplementary charge-sheet no. 86 dated 14.05.2006?  Taking cognizance of an offence means taking judicial notice of the prima facie commission of an offence against a particular accused. In our view, unless cognizance is taken of the offence against him, his subsequent trial, if any, can not be sustainable in law inasmuch as the learned Tribunal Judge did not prima facie hold that there was commission of any offence by him. In such a situation, the trial of the accused shall stand vitiated.<br/> <br/>In this case, admittedly no cognizance was taken of the offence against the accused Amzad on the basis of the supplementary charge-sheet and that meant that there was no prima facie commission of the offence by him. Considered from this standpoint, the trial of the accused Amzad by the Tribunal below is, no doubt, a mistrial. We have already noticed that the non-taking of cognizance of the offence against the offender was one of the reasons for reversal of his conviction in the case of the Crown -Vs- Pirdhan Rautamall &amp; Co. represented by Matilal Mulgulia reported in 2 DLR 304. In the present case, the non-taking of cognizance of the offence against the accused Amzad by the concerned Tribunal Judge is admitted. Such being the state of affairs, we opine that the non-taking of cognizance of the offence against the accused Amzad on the basis of the supplementary charge-sheet by the concerned Tribunal Judge has vitiated the trial of the case so far as it relates to him. This illegality is not curable by Section 537 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. So we can not maintain the order of conviction and sentence passed against the accused Amzad. Consequently, the accused Amzad is entitled to acquittal.<br/> <br/>We may now deal with the question of commutation of the death sentence of Masum to imprisonment for life as strenuously urged Mr. Syed Mizanur Rahman. According to the learned Deputy Attorney-General Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam, the accused Masum committed the crime against the State, social structure and the Judiciary and in the process of commission of the crime, many persons including the Joint District Judge M.A. Sufian (P.W. 31) were injured and one Mozibul Haque died. As a matter of fact, the commutation of death sentence of a condemned person to life-term imprisonment depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case. No strait-jacket formula can be laid down in this respect. Mr. Syed Mizanur Rahamn has relied upon a good number of decisions mainly of the High Court Division in respect of commutation of the death sentence of Masum to life-term imprisonment. The learned Deputy Attorney-General Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam has also relied upon some decisions of the Appellate Division for upholding the death penalty imposed upon him.<br/> <br/>It is axiomatic that in the criminal justice delivery system, sentencing is the cutting-edge of the judicial process.<br/> <br/>In the case of Abul Khair -Vs- The State reported in 44 DLR (AD) 225, it was observed in paragraph 17:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“17. Delay by itself in the execution of sentence of death is by no means an extenuating circumstance for commuting the sentence of death to imprisonment for life. There must be other circumstances of a compelling nature which together with delay will merit such commutation. We find no compelling extenuating circumstance in this case and therefore find no ground whatsoever to interfere.” </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of the State -Vs- Rokeya Begum alias Rokaya Begum and another (condemned-prisoners) reported in 13 BLT (HCD) 377, it was held in paragraph 51:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“51. Sentencing discretion on the part of a Judge is the most difficult task to perform. It is, also, not possible to lay down any cut and dry formula for imposition of sentence, but the object of sentence should be to see that crime does not go unpunished and the victim of crime as, also, the society has the satisfaction that justice has been done. It will be a mockery of justice to permit the accused to escape the extreme penalty of law when faced with such evidence and cruel act perpetrated by the offenders. To give lesser punishment to the condemned prisoners who stand convicted in a shocking and revolting crime would render the Justicing System of the country suspect. Under sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more harm to Justice System to undermine public confidence in the efficacy of law.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Undeniably, the condemned-prisoner Masum has been in the condemned cell for over 6(six) years. Long pendency of the Death Reference per se is not a ground for commutation of the death sentence of Masum to life-term imprisonment. There must be other circumstances of a compelling nature as observed by the Appellate Division in the decision reported in 44 DLR (AD) 225 (supra).<br/> <br/>It may be recalled that Mr. Syed Mizanur Rahman has urged for commutation of the death sentence of Masum to life-term imprisonment in view of his tender age and long pendency of the Death Reference in the High Court Division. By the way, at the time of the commission of the offence, Masum was about 21/22 years of age.<br/> <br/>In the decision in the case of Abdul Khaleque Mir -Vs- The State reported in 2BLT(AD) 172 relied upon by the learned Deputy Attorney-General Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam, it was held in paragraph 15:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“15. The Government may consider the destitute nature of the family consisting of several children and a wife who will be left without any moorings if the sentence of death passed against the condemned-prisoner is maintained and executed. There will be both a real and psychological deprivation and traumatic experience to the large number of children, who are innocent, if their father, namely, the accused-petitioner is to suffer the sentence of death. The misery of a poor family is likely to become more miserable. These considerations which are in the nature of human concern can not be legally a matter for a Court of law for imposing a lesser sentence under Section 302 of the Penal Code once the offence is proved; but the Government and/or the President may always exercise their power under the law for commuting the sentence of death on considerations as referred to above or on any other legitimate consideration.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Islamuddin (Md) @ Din Islam  -Vs- The State reported in 13 BLC (AD) 81 referred to by the learned Deputy Attorney-General Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam, it was held in paragraph 9:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“9. It further appears that the High Court Division also considered the argument of the learned Counsel for the condemned- prisoner  that the condemned-prisoner being a young man of 33 years, the ends of justice would be met if the sentence of imprisonment for life was awarded to him instead of death  sentence. But the High Court Division opined that in the facts and circumstances of the case and the heinous nature of offence, the condemned-prisoner deserved punishment as has been imposed upon him by the trial Court.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Ultimately the Appellate Division concurred with the view of the High Court Division and maintained the death sentence imposed upon the condemned-prisoner by the trial Court in that case.<br/> <br/>While commuting the sentence of death to imprisonment for life in the case of Chowla  -Vs- .The  State of Haryana reported in AIR 1974 (SC) 1039, it was spelt out as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Perhaps none of the above circumstances, taken singly and judged rigidly by the old draconian standards would be sufficient to justify the imposition of the lesser penalty nor are these circumstances adequate enough to palliate the offence of murder. But in their totality, they tilt the judicial scales in favour of life rather than putting it out.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>We have gone through the decisions referred to by Mr. Syed Mizanur Rahman carefully. It seems that the High Court Division commuted the death sentences to life-term imprisonments in view of tender age of the condemned-prisoners and long pendency of the Death References; but this view of the High Court Division is not in keeping with that of the Appellate Division, as noticed above.<br/> <br/>In the decision in the case of Madan Gopal Kakkad -Vs- Naval Dubey and another reported in 3 SCC (1992) 204,  paragraph 58 runs as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“58. We feel that Judges who bear the Sword of Justice should not hesitate to use that Sword with the utmost severity, to the full and to the end, if the gravity of the offences so demand.” </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Coming back to the instant case, the sentence should commensurate with the gravity of the offence. It goes without saying that the criminal act of the condemned-appellant Masum is fiendish, diabolical, heinous and shocking to our conscience. In fact, we do not find any mitigating or extenuating circumstance of a compelling nature for the purpose of commutation of his death sentence; rather all the circumstances are aggravating. In such a landscape, we should not hesitate to use the Sword of Justice with the utmost severity, to the full and to the end. As it is not only a crime against a particular individual but also a crime against the judicial system as a whole as is evident from the confessional statement of Masum (Exhibit-15) and as rightly pointed out by the learned Deputy Attorney-General Mr. Md. Khurshedul Alam, the extreme penalty of death, to our mind, will be an appropriate sentence for the commission of the offence by the accused Masum. So we are unable to accept the submission or prayer of Mr. Syed Mizanur Rahman in respect of commutation of the death sentence of the appellant Masum to imprisonment for life. Accordingly that submission or prayer stands negatived.<br/> <br/>It transpires from the impugned judgment that the accused Masum was also awarded a fine of Tk. 1,00,000/- along with the death sentence. It should be borne in mind that imposition of fine on a death sentence awardee is improper or inapposite, though not illegal. So the sentence of fine imposed upon him is set aside.<br/> <br/>The other order of conviction and sentence recorded against the condemned-prisoner Masum under Section 4(b) of the Explosive Substances Act is, no doubt, a superfluity and that being so, the same is knocked down.<br/> <br/>From the foregoing discussions, we do not find any merit in Criminal Appeal No. 902 of 2007 preferred by the condemned-prisoner Masum and as such it is dismissed with the modification of the impugned judgment made in the body of this judgment. Consequently, we accept the Death Reference in part so far as it relates to the condemned-prisoner Masum, confirm the death sentence imposed upon him and affirm the impugned order of conviction and sentence recorded against him under Section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908.<br/> <br/>The Criminal Appeal No. 7820 of 2012 is allowed and the Death Reference is rejected so far as it relates to the condemned-appellant Amzad Ali. The impugned order of conviction and sentence passed against the appellant Amzad Ali under Sections 3/6 and 4(b)/6 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 is set aside and he is acquitted of the charge levelled against him.<br/> <br/>Let the accused-appellant Amzad Ali @ Mohammad Hossain @ Babu be set at liberty at once, if not wanted in connection with any other case.<br/> <br/>Let the records of the Tribunal below along with a copy of this judgment be sent down at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

In the remark’s column of the said khatian that pond had been shown as being used ‘by the public’ but in the D.P.Khatian No.1362 the said pond had been wrongly recorded in the name of respondent No.2 having no right, title, interest and possession therein. The suit pond measuring 1.71 acres of plot No.680 appertaining to C.S. Khatian No.17 is being used by the public but in the D.P. Khatian No.538 the same had been wrongly recorded in the name of respondent No.1. The suit pond measuring 0.23 acre of C.S. Khatian No.17 containing plot No.1108 belonged to Jogodeshwari and others and the said pond is also being used by the public but in D.P. Khatian No.1076 the same had been wrongly recorded in the name of respondent Nos.3-5. It has further been alleged that the defendants respondents in connivance with the settlement officials have managed to get their names recorded in D.P. Khatian in respect of the suit ponds. In fact, the petitioners and the general public have been enjoying the possession of the said ponds in exercise of their easement right. The cause of action of the suit arose on 15.11.2000 when the defendants-respondents obstructed the petitioners from exercising their right of easement in the suit ponds. Hence the suit.<br/> <br/>The defendants respondents appeared and contested the suit by filing a joint written statement denying the materials statements made in the plaint.<br/> <br/>On 16.05.2006, the petitioners filed an application under Order VI Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure before the learned Senior Assistant Judge, First Court, Bogra for amendment of the plaint. They stated, inter alia, that owing to inadvertence some import-ant facts have not been incorporated in the plaint. Not only correction of the description of the names of some of the plaintiffs is necessary but striking out the name of plaintiff No.61 is also essential. Inclusion of C.S. Khatian No.18 containing plot Nos.709, 680 and 1108 is essential and a paragraph to the effect that the plaintiffs-petitioners shall conduct the suit in representative character for declaration of their easement and customary right on replacing the original prayer for declaration of their title over the suit ponds is also necessary.<br/> <br/>Respondent Nos.1-13 contested the application by filing written objection dated 28.06.2006. They contended, inter alia, that the proposed amendment has introduced new facts and different cause of action from those which have been made earlier in the plaint and that the said prayer has been made after 6(six) years from the date of initiation of the instant suit. It has been contended that the procedures under Order 1 Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure having not been complied with, the prayer for amendment of the plaint should be rejected.<br/> <br/>The learned Senior Assistant Judge, First Court, Bogra by his judgment and order dated 27.07.2006 allowed the application.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved respondent Nos.1-13 preferred Civil Revision No.98 of 2006 before the District Judge, Bogra who after hearing both the parties, vide judgment and order dated 07.03.2007 allowed the said Civil Revision setting aside the order dated 27.07.2006 passed by the learned Senior Assistant Judge, First Court, Bogra in Other Suit No. 300 of 2000.<br/> <br/>Challenging the judgment and order passed by the learned District Judge rejecting the prayer for amendment the plaintiffs-petitioners filed a revisional application before the High Court Division and obtained Rule in Civil Revision No.1396 of 2007.<br/> <br/>The High Court Division discharged the Rule by the impugned judgment and order dated 15.01.2009.<br/> <br/>Feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division, the plaintiffs-petitioners have preferred this civil petition for leave to appeal before this Division.<br/> <br/>Mr. Shaheed Alam, learned Advocate, appearing on behalf of the leave petitioners, submits that the High Court Division wrongly came to a finding that the proposed amendment would change nature and character of the suit although addition of new fact cannot in any way change the nature and character and as such the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court Division should be set aside.<br/> <br/>Mr. Abul Kalam Mainuddin, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of respondent Nos.1-13, supports the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates, the impugned judgment and order and the materials on record.<br/> <br/>The plaintiffs instituted Other Class Suit No.300 of 2000 in the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, First Court, Bogra, for declaration of title and for establishment of their easement right over the suit ponds. From the impugned judgment, it appears that the plaintiffs amended the plaint more than once. On 15.06.2006, the plaintiffs filed an application under Order 6 Rule 17 read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure for amendment of plaint incorporating new facts and prayer.<br/> <br/>On 27.07.2006, the trial Court allowed the application for amendment of plaint with a cost of Tk.500 as it was filed at a belated stage without assigning any other reason whatsoever.<br/> <br/>The contesting defendant challenged the order of amendment in Civil Revision No.98 of 2006 before the District Judge, Bogra. On 07.03.2007, the learned District Judge allowed the revision holding that in the application, it was not clarified as to why the application for amendment was filed at a belated stage and that the amendment had changed the nature and character of the suit.<br/> <br/>The High Court Division affirmed the judgment and order of the learned District Judge holding that the amendment would change the nature and character of the suit.<br/> <br/>Having considered the application for amendment, it appears that the plaintiffs incorporated new facts by the amendment but incorporation of new fact cannot in any way change the nature and character of the suit. The suit still be named as a suit for declaration of plaintiffs’ easement right.<br/><br/>The finding of the High Court Division that the nature and character of the suit would be changed by the amendment without elaboration of its finding cannot sustain in law. Amendment is always necessary to determine the real question of controversy between the parties otherwise there is likelihood of croping-up of multifarious litigations.<br/> <br/>Admittedly the trial Court allowed the application for amendment by a cryptic and slipshod order. A judicial order devoid of reasoning causes error of law but mere error of law cannot be a ground for interference unless it has occasioned failure of justice. While exercising any discretion under Order VI Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure the court is required to assign its reasons so that when the order is called in question, the higher Court may be in position to see that there has been application of mind by the Court concerned and that it is aware of the principles involved in the exercise of its discretion.<br/> <br/>In this connection, reliance may be made on the case of <strong><em>Abdul Motaleb Vs. Md. Ershad Ali and others (1998) 18 BLD(AD)121</em></strong> in which it was held that, since the impugned order was not a speaking order, could not by itself be a valid ground for interference by the High Court Division unless it could be shown that the Subordinate Court has committed any error of law ‘resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice’. The order of the learned Senior Assistant Judge may have been a bad or improper order for not assigning reasons but before interfering with the same the High Court Division is required to examine whether the same has resulted in an erroneous decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/> <br/>In the above case, the Appellate Division held as under:<br/> <br/>“There is one limitation in amending a plaint which is well recognized, that is, the nature and character of a suit cannot be changed by amendment. It is not, however, always correctly appreciated as to what is meant by a change in the nature and character of the suit. For example, as in the present case, a simple suit for declaration of title to the suit land was converted following an alleged dispossession in the meantime, into a suit for recovery of possession by amendment. Can it be said that by adding a new prayer for recovery of possession there has been a change, although apparently it may seem so, in the nature and character of the suit? ‘The answer is obviously no. Has there been a change in the nature and character of the suit then by adding the prayer for partition which was allowed by the learned Subordinate Judge? The answer again must be no, because the principle is that the nature and character of a suit do not change so long as the fundamental character of the suit remains the same.”<br/> <br/>In the above case, this Division has found that a suit for simple declaration of title to the suit land may continue with an additional prayer for recovery if the disposes-ession was made during pendency of the suit. Even in a suit for declaration of title and recovery of possession, the plaintiff may ask for partition and such amendment by introdu-ceing a relief for partition will not change the nature and character of the suit.<br/> <br/>In the case of <strong><em>Managing Committee N.M.C. Model High School and others Vs. Obaidur Rahman Chowdhury and others, (1979) 31 DLR(AD) 133,</em></strong> the plaintiff initially filed a suit for permanent injunction. During progress of the suit the defendants raised some structures and then the plaintiff filed an application under Order VI Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure praying for amendment of plaint by adding a new prayer for declaration of title and recovery of possession of a portion alleged to have been encroached upon by the defendants. The plaintiffs paid <strong><em>advalorem</em></strong> court fee on the proposed amended plaint. The order of amen-dment was upheld by the Courts below. Turning down the contention of the defendants who stated that the proposed amendment would change the nature and character of the suit land this Division held as under:<br/> <br/>“Turning to the leave order we find that it is now well-settled that the amendment of the pleadings could be allowed at any stage of the proceedin-gs for the purpose of determining the real question of controversy between the parties, but it could not be allowed, if, it changed the nature and character of the suit, or if the prayer for amendment had became barred by lapse of time and a right had accrued to the other side. But the latter principle can be departed from, if there are circumstances which outweigh the hardship and cause a prejudice to the applicant.”<br/> <br/>In the case referred to above this Division relied upon the case of <strong><em>Charan Das Vs. Amir Khan, A.I.R. 1921 P.C.50,</em></strong> which has been followed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of <strong><em>Keramat Ali Vs. Muhammad Younus Haji P.L.D. 1963 (S.C.) 191=15 DLR(S.C.)120.</em></strong> This Division also considered the case of <strong><em>Md. Zahoor Ali Khan’s case 11 M.L.A. 468 </em></strong>in which <strong><em>Privy Councils’</em></strong> observation is that the Mufussil Court’s pleadings are to be construed liberally and for the confused pleadings, the party should not suffer. We cannot make ourselves oblivious of the prevailing situation in the <strong><em>Mufussil Courts</em></strong> where drafting of good pleading is a rarity now-a-days. For the failure of the lawyers the common litigants should not be penalized. One of the fundamental principles governing the amendment of the pleadings is that all the controversies between the parties as far as possible should be included and multiplicity of the proceedings avoided.<br/> <br/>Therefore, the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division affirming the judgment and order passed by the learned District Judge cannot sustain.<br/> <br/>Admittedly the suit filed in 2000 is yet to be disposed of by the trial Court. Such being the state of affairs we do not find any point dragging the case before this Division in an interlocutory matter. Therefore, it would be proper to dispose of this Civil Petition for Leave to appeal.<br/> <br/>Accordingly the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division affirming the judgment and order passed by the learned District Judge is set aside and the order of trial Court allowing amendment is restored. The trial Court is directed to dispose of the suit as expeditiously as possible.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

In the alleged death certificate the address is different from the address as given in the plaint and decree in question.

Case No.2 of 2006 rejecting the application under Order IX, Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure for restoration of Other Class Suit No.94 of 1995 decreeing the suit exparte on 3.5.2006 should not be set aside.<br/> <br/>Facts necessary for the disposal of the Rule are that one Al-hajj Mahmuddunnabi Chowdhury, the  predecessor of the defendant Nos.1-10 filed Other Class Suit No. 91 of 1990 in the Court of the  Assistant Judge,  1st Court, Chittagong for ejectment of tenant and realization of outstanding rent along with compensation against the defendant Sheikh Bashir Ali ( proprietor of  M/S. Mohammadi Metal Industry) and M/S. Mohammadi Metal Industry. The suit was subsequently renumber-red on transfer in the Court of the learned  Additional Senior Assistant Judge, 3rd Court, Sadar, Chittagong as Other Class Suit No.94 of 1995. During the pendency of the suit plaintiff Mahamuddun Nabi Chowdhury died and the opposite party Nos.1-10 were substituted as plaintiffs in place of their predecessor, Mahamuddun Nabi Chowdhury.<br/> <br/>The defendant Nos.1-2 entered appear-ance in the suit on 11.02.1991 and filed written statement on 19.5.1991 denying most of the allegations of the plaint contending, inter-alia, that the defendant No.1 is not a defaulter in payment of rent and the plaintiff filed the suit without serving any notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act and as such the suit is liable to be dismissed. The defendant Nos. 1-2, finally did not turn to contest the suit and consequently exparte decree was passed on 3.5.2006.<br/> <br/>In this background of the case the present petitioner showing himself as defendant of Other Suit No. 94 of 1995/90 of 1991 filed Miscellaneous case No. 02 of 2006 under Order IX,  Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure  for setting-aside the exparte judgment and decree dated 3.5.2006 passed in Other Suit No. 94 of 1995/90 of 1991 stating that defendant Sheikh Bashir Ali converted his private enterprise Mohammadi Metal Industries into M/S. Mohammadi Metal Industries Limited in 1981 and got it registered on 06.06.1991 as per Government registration No. C-9066/905 1980-1981 and the petitioner Salamat Hossain became its Managing Director and two other Share holders named Mrs. Salma Begum and Habibur Rahman became Directors and afterwards M/S. Mahammadi Metal Industries Limited expanded the Industry by including 5 other share holders named (1) Kazi Abu Kalam (2) Mrs. Subra Das (3) Kazal Chandra Das (4) Md. Hashem (5) Abdul Hashem and after the death of Sheikh Basir Ali (Managing Director),  the petitioner Salamat Hossain purchased the shares of Mrs. Salma Begum and Md. Habibur Rahman on 28.11.2005 and thereafter, he became its Managing Director by a resolution of the general meeting of the Industry held on 20.12.2005 under section 110 of the company Act, 1994.  The proceeding of Other Class Suit No. 94 of 1995 was stayed by an order passed in Civil Revision 2231 of 1996 though after vacating said the order of stay the trial Court fixed the suit for peremptory hearing on 03.05.2006 without notifying or informing  the learned Advocate for the  defendant Nos. 1-2 and the suit was  decreed exparte virtually  against a dead man without impleading the successors of deceased defendant No. 1, Sheikh Basir Ali who died on 04.05.2003 and as such  the exparte decree is liable to be set-aside.<br/> <br/>The plaintiff-opposite parties contested the Miscellaneous Case No. 02 of 2006 by filing written objection. The plaintiff-opposite parties case in short is that the petitioner Md. Salmat Hossen was never a tenant of plaintiffs, nor the petitioner paid any rent to the plaintiffs nor there was any tenancy agreement between plaintiff/s and petitioner, Md. Salamat Hossen nor the decree was passed against any dead man nor it is true that the trial of suit was resumed without informing to the learned Advocate of the principal defendants. The petitioner has no locus standi to file the miscellaneous case under Order IX, Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure for setting-aside the exparte decree dated 3.5.2006 passed in Other Suit No. 94 of 1995/90 of 1991 and hence, the miscellaneous case is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/>The trial Court by its judgment and order dated 04.10.2009 dismissed the Miscellaneous case No.02 of 2006.<br/> <br/>The unsuccessful petitioner Md. Salamat Hossen then took an appeal therefrom to the Court of   learned District Judge, Chittagong  which was ultimately heard and disposed of by learned Additional District Judge, 4<sup>th</sup>  Court, Chittagong who by his judgment and order dated 26.09.2010  dismissed the appeal and affirmed the judgment of the trial Court and the instant Civil Revision is directed against that judgment and order dated 26.09.2010.<br/> <br/>Mr. Mohammad Jamir Uddin Sircar, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner in the course of his argument after placing the judgments of both the Courts below and other materials on record submits that both the courts below having failed to consider that defendant No. 1, Sheikh Bashir Ali, who died on 4.5.2003  and  exparte decree was passed   on  3.5.2006 against deceased Sheikh Bashir Ali,  which is a nullity and thus fell into an error of law in disallowing the Misc. Case under Order IX,  Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure  and the same has occasioned failure of justice. He next submits that  the proceeding of Other Class Suit No. 94 of 1995 was stayed by an order of this Court passed in Civil Revision 2231 of 1996 but after vacating the order of stay the trial Court fixed the suit for peremptory hearing on 03.05.2006 without notifying or informing  the learned Advocate for the  defendant Nos. 1-2 and in this way the suit was  decreed exparte virtually  against a dead man without substituting the successors of deceased defendant No. 1, Sheikh Basir Ali who died on 04.05.2003 and as such  at any rate the impugned exparte decree dated 3.5.2006 is liable to be set-aside.<br/> <br/>Mr. Sircar further argues that both the Courts below failed to consider that the petitioner stepped into the shoes of Sheikh Bashir Ali, the Managing Director of M/S Mohammadi Metal Industries, a private enterprise after it was transformed into M/S Mohammadi Metal Industries Ltd. a public company and thereby most illegally  arrived at a finding that  the petitioner  was not a party in Other Class Suit No.94 of 1995 and the impugned exparte decree was not passed against him and as such the same has occasioned failure of justice.<br/> <br/>Mr. Sk. Zulfiqur Bulbul Chowdhury, the learned Advocate appearing for the opposite party Nos.1-10, on the other hand, by filing counter affidavit supports the impugned judgments of 2 (two) Courts below and contends that both the Courts below were  perfectly justified in rejecting the petitioner's application under Order IX, Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure for setting-aside exparte decree dated 3.5.2006 on the clear findings that neither the petitioner, Md. Salamat Hossain nor M/S. Mohammadi Metal Industries Ltd.  was defendant in the other suit No.94 of 1995 and  hence a third party is not entitled to file Miscellaneous Case No.02 of 2006 under Order IX,  Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure  against the decree passed in Other Suit No.94 of 1995.<br/> <br/>Mr. Chowdhury next submits that original Other Suit No. No. 94 of 1995/90 of 1991  was decreed agai-nst Sheikh Bashir Ali,  who was not in fact died on 04.05.2003 as alleged by the petitioner Md. Salamat Hossen inasmuch as it is apparent from the evidence of the petitioner Md. Salamat Hossain in Miscellaneous Case No. 02 of 2006 that he submitted annual report in the form of Particulars of Directors (P.D) in the year 2005-2008 to the Registrar, Joint Stock Company and Firms showing the defendant No.1,  Sheikh Bashir Ali as existing Director and alive, hence both the Courts below correctly found that the plea as raised by the petitioner that decree in question   was passed against a dead man is not true.He adds that   the petitioner Md. Salamat Hossen did neither show nor produce any death certificate even on the date of filing of the instant revisional application from Khulna City Corporation or from any other authority showing that the defendant No.1,  Sheikh Bashir Ali died on 03.05.2003 and subsequent  death certificate dated 09.06.2007 allegedly issued by Khulna City  Corporation filed by petitioner in his supplementary affidavit dated 07.02.2013 shows that the person Sk. Bashir Ali named in said death certificate dated 09.06.2007 and the defendant No.1 Sheikh Bashir Ali of Other Class Suit No. 94 of 1995 are separate two persons but the petitioner Md. Salamat Hossen for the first time at the belated stage with a view to fortify his case that  defendant No.1 Sheikh Bashir Ali of Other Class Suit No.94 of 1995 died at Khulna on 04.05.2003  produced a self manufactured death certificate  before this Court.<br/> <br/>Referring to the order sheets passed in  other class suit No.94 of 1995  Mr. Zulfiqur Bulbul Chowdhury submits that the contention as raised by the learned Advocate for the petitioner that the judgment and decree was passed against a dead man is not correct inasmuch as there is nothing on record to suggest that during the pendency of the suit the legal heirs or legal representative  of defendant Nos.1 and 2 brought the matter to the notice of the Court below  that the defendant Sheikh Bashir Ali died during pendency of the suit rather the record speaks that the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 after  filing written statement willfully did not turn to contest the suit. Mr. Chowdhury finally submits that from the finding of two Courts below and other materials on record it is evident that the petitioner as a illegal occupant in order to sit over the suit land years together without any payment of any rent filed this Misc. Case under Order 9, Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure with unclean and dirty hands and as such the Rule is liable to be discharged with exemplary cost.<br/> <br/>I have heard the learned Advocates of both the sides, perused the impugned judgment, deposition of witnesses and other materials on record. The facts of the case have already been set out so, I need not to repeat the same again. Now, the material question for consideration is whether the Court of appeal below was  justified in affirming the finding of the trial Court below that the petitioner has no locus standi to file an application under Order IX, Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure for setting-aside the exparte decree dated 3.5.2006 passed in Other Class Suit No.94 of 1995.<br/> <br/>In order to resolve this dispute let me advert the evidence on record.  It appears that petitioner Md. Salamat Hossain himself was examined as PW-1, who  in his cross-examination categorically  admitted that : "মুল মামলার আরজি­তে ছালামত হো­সেন বাদী ছি­­লন না।.....মুল একতরফা ডিক্রী হওয়ার আ­­গ আমি নি­জে ওকালতনামা দস্তখত ক­রে আমি কোন উকিল নি­য়োগ করি নাই"   .....মুল মামলায় আমি ­কোন জবাব দাখিল করি নাই। .....প্রতিপক্ষগ­নের পূর্ববর্তী মাহামুদুন্নবী মুল মামলা দা­­য়র করিয়াছি­­লন বশির আলীর বিরুদ্ধে। মুল মামলার আরজী­­ত আমার বিরুদ্ধে কোন প্রতিকার চাওয়া হয়নি।.....সংশ্লিষ্ট সম­য় অামি মুল মামলায় ছিলাম না।"<br/> <br/>From the above, it appears that the petitioner Md. Salamat Hossain was not a defendant in original Other suit No. 94 of 1995/90 of 1991  nor there was any name in the plaint "Salamat Hossain" as defendant and no relief was sought for against him in the plaint  and he neither filed any vokalatnama nor appointed any Advocate to contest the suit. It is found that the Court of appeal below has come to the conclusion that the petitioner has no right to call in question the legality and propriety of the exparte decree dated 3.5.2006 passed in Other Class Suit No.94 of 1995 since he was not a party in the suit and no decree was passed against him. In coming to this conclusion the said Court has observed that the trial Court below  on due consideration of the materials on record together with the case record of Other Class Suit No.94 of 1995 rightly arrived  at a finding that the petitioner, Md. Salamat Hossain is a 3<sup>rd</sup> party, who has no locus standi to file Misc. Case No. 2 of 2006  under Order 9, Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure for setting aside the exparte decree passed in Other Suit No.94 of 1995 .<br/> <br/>In view of the above finding of the Court of appeal bellow arrived at after  considering the evidence on record,  I do not find any  possible reason to differ with the view taken by both the Courts below that in the facts and  circumstance of the case the petitioner has no locus standi to file Misc. Case under Order 9, Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure for setting aside the exparte decree inasmuch as the petitioner was neither a party in the suit nor any decree was passed against him in Other Suit No.94 of 1995.<br/> <br/>To meet the submission of Mr. Mohammad Jamir Uddin Sircar that the judgment and decree was in fact passed against a dead man which is a nullity, I have carefully examined the record, it appears that the principal defendant Sheikh Bsashir Ali entered appearance in the suit and  filed written statement on 10.5.1991 and  lastly on 26.5.2005  after filing hajira  he did not turn to contest the suit. It further appears that during pendency of the suit no one on behalf of the contesting principal defendant No. 1, Sheikh Bsashir Ali brought to the notice of the Court that the defendant Sheikh Bashir Ali died. Moreover, the petitioner to prove that during pendency of the suit Sheikh Bashir Ali died did not produce any death certificate of Sheikh Bashir Ali in the Courts below.<br/> <br/>Further, it appears from the evidence of PW-1, petitioner Md. Salamat Hossain that he submitted annual report in the form of Particulars of Directors (P.D) in the year 2005-2008 to the Registrar, Joint Stock Company and Firms showing the defendant No.1, Sheikh Bashir Ali as existing director and alive, hence the plea as raised that the defendant No.1, Sheikh Bashir Ali died on 04.05.2003 appears to be false and without any legal basis. It also appears that the petitioner did not produce any death certificate of defendant No.1 Sheikh Bashir Ali even on the date of filing of the instant revisional application from Khulna City Corporation or from any other authority showing that the defendant No.1 Sheikh Bashir Ali died on 03.05.2003. It further appears from the plaint and decree in question that the address of Sheikh Bashir Ali  had mentioned as 312/B, Love Lane, P.S. Kotwali, Chittagong but the death certificate shows the address of Sheikh Bashir Ali  is written as 328, Sher-E-Bangla Road, Khulna (Annexure-B to the supplementary affidavit dated 7.02.2013) and thus, in the facts and circumstance of the case sitting under revisional jurisdiction it is very difficult to rely upon this type of death certificate. Therefore, I do not find any reason to hold that the petitioner has been able to prove that the exparte decree was passed against a dead man.<br/> <br/>Now, it remains for me to consider the last submission of Mr. Sircar that the petitioner stepped into the shoes of the original defendant Nos. 1-2 and in that view of the matter, it can not be said that the petitioner has no locus standi to file Misc. Case under Order 9, Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure for setting aside the exparte decree passed in Other Suit No.94 of 1995.<br/> <br/>It appears that petitioner, Md. Salamat Hossain as PW-1 categorically admitted in his evidence to the effect that "Defendant Mohammadi Metal Industries is proprietorship firm of Sheikh Bashir Ali and the Mohammadi Metal Industries Limited is not same establishment, both are different and separate establishment.  Therefore, I am unable to see eye to eye to such submission of Mr. Mohammad Jamir Uddin Sircar that the petitioner stepped into the shoes of defendant Nos. 1-2, rather I find there is a good deal of substance in the contention raised by  Mr. Sk. Zulfiqur Bulbul Chowdhury that the petitioner is a stranger to the suit,  who has no right to file an application under Order 9, Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure for setting aside the exparte decree passed in Other Suit No.94 of 1995. It is on record that the principal defendant No. 1, Sheikh Bashir Ali after filing written statement finally did not contest the suit. Provision of Order XXII, Rule 4(4) CPC provides that the heirs of non contesting defendant need not be  substituted.<br/><br/>On perusal of the record, it appears that the proceeding of Other Class Suit No. 94 of 1995 was stayed by an order of this court passed in Civil Revision 2231 of 1996 and  after vacating the order of stay the trial Court fixed the suit for peremptory hearing on 03.05.2006 which was seen by Mr. Uma Pada Talukder, Advocate for the defendants  before the hearing of the Other Suit No.94 of 1995. So the allegation of passing decree beyond the knowledge of defendant Nos.1 and 2 is not  correct. The contentions raised for the afore-said reason are of no substance.<br/><br/>By now I have covered all the points raised by Mr. Mohammad Jamir Uddin Sircar.<br/><br/>On an analysis of the impugned judgment, it appears that the learned  Additional District Judge  examined the records of the case and arrived at a finding inter alia, that:  “এমতাবস্থায় বিজ্ঞ নিম্ন অাদালত উপস্থাপিত সাক্ষ্য প্রমান ও অপর ৯৪/৯৫ মোকদ্দমার নথি পর্যা­লাচনাক্রমে প্রার্থী/আপীলকারী অপর ৯৪/৯৫ মোকদ্দমার বিবাদীপক্ষ না হওয়ায় মিছ ২/০৬ মোকদ্দমা দা­য়ের করার আইনগত কোন অধিকার নাই ম­র্মে সিদ্ধান্ত প্রদান আইনসংগত হওয়ায় তর্কিত রায় বহাল থাক­­ব। প্রার্থী/আপীলকারীর আপীল ­­মামলার দাবী এবং মিছ ২/০৬ মোকদ্দমার মিছ দরখা­স্তের দাবী সম্পূর্ণরূপে মিথ্যা ও মনগড়া হওয়ায় অত্র মিছ আপীল মোকদ্দমায় প্রার্থীত প্রতিকার পা­বে না।”<br/><br/>This findings of the Court of appeal below are in fact  based on proper and correct appreciation of both law and fact. In view of provisions of law only the defendant of the suit can file Miscellaneous Case under Order 9, Rule 13 of CPC with a prayer for setting aside the exparte decree. Stranger or any 3<sup>rd</sup> party has no locus standi to institute or maintain Miscellaneous Case under Order 9, Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure for setting aside the exparte decree passed.<br/><br/>In view of my discussions made in the forgoing paragraphs it is by now clear that the instant Rule must fail.<br/><br/>In the result, the Rule is discharged without any order as to costs.  The order of stay granted earlier by this Court stands vacated.<br/><br/>Let a copy of this judgment along with the lower Court’s record be sent down at once.           <br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Shahidul Islam alias Shahid, sought for bail in S. T. Case no. 533 of 2010 arising out of Hathazari Police Station Case no. 12(12)2009, corresponding to G.R. no. 301 of 2009 under Sections 395, 397 of the Penal Code, pending in the Court of learned Additional Sessions Judge, first Court, Chittagong.<br/><br/>Facts in brief are that on 10-12-2009 informant Md. Nizamuddin lodged an FIR against one  accused namely Md. Tajul Islam alleging that on the night following 09-12-2009 at 02.00 hrs – 02.15 hrs all accused forcibly entered into his shop and committed dacoity and plundered all the commodities. The locals nabbed four accused, of whom three accused beaten to death and only FIR named accused Tazul Islam was seriously wounded. With these allegations the informant lodged the FIR.<br/><br/>During investigation three accused including the petitioner made confession implicating themselves into the commission of offence of dacoity.<br/><br/>The Police after investigation submitted charge sheet accusing the petitioner and two others. The case is still pending before the Additional Sessions Judge, first Court, Chitta-ong for trial and no witness has yet been examined.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that the petitioner was arrested on 13-12-2009 since then he is in custody. He adds that the confession was extracted from him under torture and coercion.  He lastly submits that co-accused Sakil who also made confess-ion was granted bail by the Court below. So the petitioner is also entitled to be enlarged on bail.<br/><br/>The Rule is opposed by the learned Deputy Attorney General however he submits that as the petitioner is in custody since long so he has nothing to submit.<br/><br/>In order to appreciate their submissions we have gone through the record and given our anxious consideration to their submissions.<br/><br/>On going to the materials on record it transpires that the name of the petitioner do not appear in the FIR. Moreso, three accused namely Sahidul Islam(petitioner), Tazul Islam and Sakil made confession, of whom accused Sakil was granted bail by the Court below. The record indicates that the petitioner was arrested on 13-12-2009 since then he is in custody. The case is still pending for trial and no witness has yet been examined. Therefore, we hold that undue delay in holding trial is a valid ground for granting bail. Moreso there is no material to discriminate the case of the petitioner from the co-accused who has been enlarged on bail by the Court below. Thus we are inclined to enlarge the petitioner on bail.<br/><br/>In the result the Rule is made absolute. Let the petitioner Md. Shahidul Islam alias Shahid be released on bail on furnishing bail bond to the satisfaction of learned Additional Sessions Judge, first Court, Chittagong.<br/><br/>The learned Judge of the Court below is at liberty to cancel the bail of the petitioner, if he misuses the privilege of bail in any manner whatsoever.<br/><br/>Office is directed to communicate the order at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

During their wedlock one child born. She used to live in her conjugal home. Her accused husband along with other accused respondents used to torture her for the cause of dowry. On 17.04.2003 all the accused tortured her and demanded Tk. 3,00,000/- (three lacs) as dowry. When she refused, she was drove out from the conjugal home. She further alleged that afterward her accused husband divorced her. The First Information Report was recorded as Mirpur P.S. case No. 88 dated 21.04.2003.<br/> <br/>The Police after investigation submitted Final Report on 18.08.2003. Against which on 30.06.2004 the informant filed a Naraji Petition.<br/> <br/>Eventually, after hearing the learned Judge accepted the Final Report by rejecting the Naraji Petition by the impugned order.<br/> <br/>Feeling aggrieved the informant preferred the instant appeal.<br/> <br/>No one appears to support the appeal. In view of the facts this is an old appeal of 2004. We are inclined to take it up for disposal on merit considering the materials on record.<br/> <br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the State opposes the appeal and submits that, the learned Judge of the Court below after considering the materials on record rightly passed the impugned order, which calls for no interference by this Court.<br/> <br/>In order to appreciate his submissions we have gone through the record and given our anxious consideration to his submissions.<br/> <br/>On going to the materials on record it transpires that, the informant made allegations -against the respondents for demanding of dowry by causing hurt which was recorded under Sections II(kha)/30 of the Nari-O-Shishu NiIjatan Daman Ain, 2000. The police during investigation recorded statements of the witnesses under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. But none of the witnesses deposed supporting the allegations of the informant. Moreover, two local witness namely Baharuddin and Md. Hossain stated that informant was divorced by her accused husb-and long before. On meticulous examination of the materials on record particularly F.I.R., and Naraji Petition, we find that the allegation made therein are contradictory to each other. Moreso, the informant was divorced on 14.1.2002 by the accused and notices were duly served upon her. So the learned Judge of the court below rightly held that after divorce the question of demanding of dowry does not arise. Moreso, there is vague and unspecific allegation of torture, Mental or physical torture and causing hurt or injury are not the same act. The allegation of torture does not mean causing hurt. Thus the vague and unspecific allegation of torture made in the First Information Report does not attract an offence under section II(kha) of the Ain. So, the allegations made in the First Information Report, even if are taken as true, do not constitute an offence punishable under section 11 (kha) or 11 (kha) / 30 of the Act. With this regard reliance is being placed in the case of MM Ishak Vs State and another 56 DLR 516.<br/> <br/>Therefore, the learned Judge of the Court below after considering the materials on record rightly accepted the Final Report by rejecting the Naraji petition of the appellant. Thus the appeal having no merit fails.<br/> <br/>In view of foregoing narrative the appeal is dismissed.<br/> <br/>Office is directed to communicate the order at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

The informant heard about the incident with his niece Rumi and on that day he, his mother Rokeya Begum and Husna Begum, his brother’s wife asked the accused about the reason of abusing Rumi, whereupon, the accused abused them as well in filthy language and at one stage, he became furious and threatened to kill them. Then the informant along with his mother and sister-in-law came back to their house and informed about the occurrence to Milon Mia, the cousin of the informant. On 15.05.2003 at about 10.00 a.m. the accused sharpened a big sword which was seen by Husna Begum and neighbour Ahid Miah with other local people who told the informant. On 16.05.2003 at about 12.45 p.m. when the mother of the informant Rokeya Begum went beside their dwelling house to call their servant Jabbar Ali, the accused abused Rokeya Begum in filthy language and at one stage, on the road near the courtyard situated in between the house of the informant and his cousin Nazrul Islam, due to previous enmity the accused dealt blow on the head of Rokeya Begum with a four feet long sharp sword causing severe bleeding injury and as a result, the brain-matter of Rokeya Begum came out forthwith and she fell down to the ground. The occurrence took place in presence of Milon Mia, Shahadat Hossain and Husna Begum. Victim Rokeya Begum was rushed to Chand-iber Hospital by Ahid Miah and Nadir. The Doctor at the Emergency Department declared her dead. The persons present ran and caught the accused with the blood stained sword in his hand while he was trying to flee and handed him over to the police. The informant having been informed over telephone returned home from the Bazar and heard the occurrence, went to hospital and saw the dead body of his mother with bleeding injury. Thereafter, the informant lodged the First Information Report (FIR) on 16.05.2003 at about 13.30 hours under section 302 of the Penal Code against the condemned petitioner. Accordingly, Bhairab Thana Case No. 20(5) 2003 corresponding to G.R. No.260(2)03 was started.<br/><br/>The Investigating Officer in the course of investigation visited the place of occurrence, prepared the sketch map with index, prepared inquest report and recorded the statement of witnesses under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. After completion of investigation he submitted Charge-sheet No.143 dated 07.07.2003 under section 302 of the Penal Code against the condemned petitioner. <br/><br/>The case was transferred to the Court of Sessions Judge, Kishorganj where it was numbered as Sessions Case No.219 of 2003 for trial.<br/><br/>Charge was framed under section 302 of the Penal Code against the condemned prisoner and read over to him to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. During trial the prosecution examined as many as thirteen P.Ws. who were cross-examined by the defence but the defence examined none. Five witnesses were tendered. The condemned petitioner was examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure when again he pleaded not guilty and repeated his claim of innocence and declined to adduce evidence.<br/><br/>The defence case as it transpires from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses was that of innocence. Positive defence taken was that the deceased, an elderly lady and patient of hypertension accidentally fell on a tin and received injury on her head resulting in her death.<br/><br/>The learned Judge of the trial Court after hearing the parties and upon consideration of the evidence and materials on record convicted the condemned prisoner Rahmat Ali alias Shukkur under section 302 of the Penal Code and sentenced him to death by his judgement and order of conviction and sentence dated 18.05.2004.<br/><br/>Reference under section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was made to the High Court Division for confirmation of the sentence of death, which was numbered as Death Reference No.74 of 2004.<br/><br/>Before the High Court Division the Jail Appeal No.521 of 2004 was preferred by the condemned petitioner, which was heard along with Death Reference. By the impugned judgment and order the High Court Division accepted the reference and dismissed the jail appeal. Hence, the condemned prisoner has filed the instant Jail Petition before this Division.<br/><br/>Mr. Helal Uddin Mollah, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that in view of the evidence on record he will not challenge the conviction of the petitioner but rather pray for commutation of the sentence of death. He points out that the petitioner has been in the condemned cell for about 8 years and has suffered the pangs of death throughout this period. He further submits that it is apparent from the evidence on record that the petitioner had a previous quarrel with the victim due to the alleged incident concerning the victim’s granddaughter. He also submits that the petitioner acted in the way he did due to previous enmity, as mentioned in the FIR, and due to emotional pressure arising out of the earlier incident when he was taken to task by the victim and her family members. He finally submits that the petitioner is a young man aged about 25 years and should be treated with leniency. He therefore prays that the sentence of death may be modified to one of imprisonment for life.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Shohrowardi, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing on behalf of the State submits that the instant case is one of cold blooded murder where the accused took preparation by sharpening his sword and waiting for the opportunity to kill the victim. He therefore prays that the judgment and order of conviction and sentence be upheld.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocate for the parties concerned and perused the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record. <br/><br/>We find from the evidence on record that the condemned prisoner–petitioner previously had an argument with the victim and other family members. The incident was witnessed by the victim’s immediate family members as well as other independent witnesses. According to P.W.10 the petitioner having struck the victim with the sword ran into the Mosque, blood stained sword in hand saying “আমি খুন করিয়া আসিয়াছি, আমাকে বাঁচান” whereupon people in the vicinity ran there and caught him. We do not find anything on record to disbelieve the witnesses and accordingly the trial Court’s finding that the petitioner was guilty under section 302 of the Penal Code must be upheld.<br/><br/>However, from the record we find that the accused was aged 25 years when the statement under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was recorded on 08.05.2004. The occurrence took place on 16.05.2003 and therefore the accused was aged only 24 years at the time of occurrence. In this regard we may refer to the decision reported in 13 DLR 203 in the case of State Vs. Tasiruddin. That case was one where the death sentence was awarded by the trial Court. Murshed, J (as his Lordship then was) analysed the principle which a Court must follow in awarding sentence when convicting under section 302 of the Penal Code. While considering the aspect of age of the accused his Lordship looked at a number of cases decided by the higher Courts of the Subcontinent where the sentence of death had been modified and substituted by transportation for life (now imprisonment for life). Their Lordships made it clear that they were not laying down any precedent which can be applied to every case when a question of commutation of death sentence was considered on account of age of the accused. Nevertheless, in that particular case where the accused was 25 years old and possibly influenced by his elder brother, the sentence of death was commutated to a sentence of transportation for life.<br/><br/>We note from the decision referred to in the above mentioned case that the death sentence imposed upon youthful offenders, even up to the age of 25 years was commuted to a sentence of transportation for life. We also note from the charge-sheet that the P.C.P.R. (previous conviction and previous record) do not disclose any previous criminal activity of the condemned petitioner which tends to show that his character is not inherently criminal in nature. We keep in mind also the fact that admittedly enmity and grudge had developed between the condemned petitioner and the victim and her family which has triggered the action of the accused.<br/><br/>In the case of Nalu Vs. State reported in 1 Apex Law Report’s (AD) 222, where the facts were similar, with similar mitigating circumstances, this Division commuted the sentence of death to one of imprisonment for life.<br/><br/>In the facts and circumstances of the instant case, keeping in mind the youth  the condemned petitioner, no previous criminal record, admitted previous enmity, the fact that he had languished in the condemned cell for more than Eight and half years, we are of the view that ends of justice will be sufficiently met if the sentence of death is commuted and altered to one of imprisonment for life.<br/>    <br/>Accordingly, the Jail Petition No. 15 of 2010 is dismissed with modification of sentence of death as stated above.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

The suit was for realisation of loan amounting to Tk. 92,059/- with interest as stood on 7.6.1989 given by the plaintiff-appellant-Bank to the defendants namely, defendant No.1 Md. Komoruddin alias Kamar and defendant No.2 Sree Narayan Chandra Basak for business in which the defendant No.1 Md. Komoruddin alias Kamar mortgaged his property in favour of the plaintiff bank to secure the  loan facility; that the defendants as per terms and conditions of loan sanction letter failed to reimburse  the loan money in due time  inspite of several letters issued by the plaintiff bank and hence the suit.<br/> <br/> The defendant No. 1 appeared in the suit and filed written statement denying all the material allegations of the plaint contending,  inter-alia,  that  the Manager of the Bank inclusion with defendant No.2 created a joint account in the name of defendant No.1 and defendant No.2 and the defendant No.1 never received or  withdrawn any money  from the said account.<br/> <br/>In the course of trial upon considering the pleadings of the parties the trail judge framed the following issues:-</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the suit is maintainable in its present form?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the suit is barred by law?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the plaintiff is entitled to get a decree as prayed for?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the plaintiff-Bank is entitled to get any other relief?</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">At the trial the plaintiff-Bank examined in all 3 PWs. and the defendants also examined 3 witnesses namely DW-1, DW-2, DW-3 and both the parties exhibited a series of documents in support of their respective cases.<br/> <br/>The learned judge of the trial Court below on consideration of the materials on record by his judgment and decree dated 16.5.1991 (decree signed on 26.5.1991) decreed the mortgage suit against defendant No.2 and dismissed the same against the defendant No.1 (Mortgagor).<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and decree dated 16.5.1991 (decree signed on 26.5.1991) the plaintiff-Bank as appellant filed the instant First Appeal before this Court.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Golam Mostafa, the learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff-appellant submits that the learned trial Judge under misconception of law and facts most illegally by the impugned judgment and decree dated 16.5.1991 decreeing the suit against the defendant No.2 while dismissing the suit against the defendant No.1, who admittedly mortgaged his property as security of the loan facility to the plaintiff-Bank. The learned Advocate next in the course of his argument has taken us through the impugned judgment and decree, loan sanction letter (Ext.7), written statement of defendant No.1 and deposition the of PWs. and DWs. and then submits that the impugned judgment so far it relates to dismissing the suit against the defendant No.1 is perverse being contrary to law as well as the material evidences on record.<br/> <br/>Referring to the concluding portion of the written statement of defendant No.1, Mr. Mostafa, the learned Advocate points out that admittedly the defendant-respondent mortgaged his property in favour of the Bank to secure the loan facility and as such the trial Court below ought to have decreed the suit against the defendant respondent No.1 Md. Komoruddin alias Kamar along with defendant No. 2. Mr. Mostafa, finally submits that from a reading of the impugned judgment, it is apparent that the learned trial Judge in order to dismiss the suit so far it relates to the defendant No.1 mechanically dealt with some irrelevant facts and as such the impugned judgment and decree so far it relates to defendant-respondent No.1 is liable to be set-aside. The learned Advocate to fortify his argument has relied on the decision reported in 43 DLR-439.<br/> <br/>No one appears on behalf of the respondents.<br/> <br/>We have heard the leaned Advocate and perused the impugned judgment, deposition of witnesses, exhibits and other materials on record. It appears that both the defendant-respondents failed to reimburse the loan inspite of several letters issued by the appellant-Bank and thereupon,  the plaintiff-Bank filed the suit for realisation of Tk. 92,059/- with interest as stood on 7.6.1989. It also appears that the trial Court below on consideration of the materials on record by the impugned judgment and decree dated 16.5.1991 decreeing the suit against the defendant No.2 while dismissing the suit against the defendant No.1 stating that: ১নং বিবাদীর সরলতা ও মুর্খতার সুযোগে তৎকালিন  ম্যানেজার ঋণ মঞ্জুর হয় নাই বলিয়া তাহাকে বলে অথচ ২ নং বিবাদী টাকা  উঠাইয়া নেয়। এই অবসহায় ১ নং বিবাদী ঋণের কোন টাকা  না নেওয়ায় তাহার বিরুদ্ধে অত্র মোকদ্দমার ডিক্রী প্রদান করিলে ন্যায় বিচারের পরিপন্থী হইবে বলিয়া আমি মনে করি। ২ নং বিবাদী কোন সম্পত্তি ব্যাংকের নিকট বন্দক না রাখায় তাহার বিরুদ্ধে বাদী-ব্যাংক দাবীকৃত টাকার জন্য ব্যক্তিগত ডিক্রী পাইতে পারে।<br/> <br/>Now, let us see how far the learned trial Judge was justified in dismissing the suit against the defendant-respondent No.1 Md. Komoruddin alias Kamar. The plaintiff-appellant-Bank in order to prove its case examined 3 witnesses and also exhibited a series of documents. PWs. namely, PW-1 and PW-2 in their respective testimony categori-cally stated that the defendant-1 mortgaged his property in favour of the plaintiff-Bank to secure the loan facility and both the defendants took loan money through their joint account No. 1540. It is found from the loan sanction letter (Ext.7) that both the defendants in agreeing with the terms and conditions of loan sanction letter put their signature in loan sanction letter (Ext.7) in presence of witnesses.<br/> <br/>Mr. Mostafa, the learned Advocate for the appellant upon referring to the concluding portion of the written statement filed by the defendant No.1 Md. Komoruddin alias Kamar wherein, it has been stated as follows: “বাদীর মোকদ্দমা আদালতের ন্যায় বিচারে আদৌ ডিক্রী হইবে বিবেচিত হইলে যাবতীয় সুদ ও খরচাদি মওকুফ করিয়া এই বিবাদীকে শুধু মাত্র আসল ২৮,৫৬০/০০ টাকা ১০ টি মাসিক কিসিত্মতে পরিশোধ করার বিহিতাদেশ দিতে মর্জি হয়। submits that from the aforesaid pleadings of the defendant No.1, it is clear that the defendant-respondent No.1 by mortgaging his property as security to the plaintiff-Bank took loan along with defendant-respondent No.2.<br/> <br/>From a reading of the above quoted written objection of the defendant No.1, we find considerable merit in the aforesaid sub-mission of Mr. Mostafa, the learned Advocate for the appellant-Bank.<br/> <br/>On perusal of the impugned judgment together with the deposition of PWs. and DWs. and other tangible materials on record, we do not find any possible reason to hold that the defendant-respondent No.1 is made a scapegoat in the facts and circumstances of the case. Rather, it seems to us that the defendant-respondent No.1 mortgaged his property as security of loan facility as well as took loon along with defendant No. 2 and thereafter, deliberately on various pretext denied the same.<br/> <br/>In the facts and circumstances of the case the grievance of Mr. Mostafa, the learned Advocate for the appellant that the learned trial Judge in order to dismiss the suit against the defendant No.1 dealt with some irrelevant facts does not appear to be without any substance. The   trial Court dismissed the suit so far it relates to defendant No. 1 on the observation  that  “ ১নং বিবাদীর সরলতা ও মুর্খতায় সুযোগে তৎকালিন ম্যানেজার ঋণ মনজ্ঞুর হয় নাই বলিয়া তাহাকে বলে অথচ ২নং বিবাদী টাকা উঠাইয়া নেয়। এই অবসহায় ১নং বিবাদী ঋনের  কোন টাকা না নেওয়ায় তাহার বিরুদ্ধে অত্র মোকদদমার ডিক্রি প্রদান করিলে ন্যায় বিচারের পরিপমহী হইবে বলিয়া আমি মনে করি। ২নং বিবাদী কোন সম্পত্তি ব্যাংকের নিকট বন্ধক না রাখায় তাহার বিরুদ্ধে বাদী ব্যাংক দাবীকৃত টাকার জন্য ব্যক্তিগত ডিক্রী পাইতে পারে। ” This finding of the trial court  is, in fact, contrary to the material evidence  on record.<br/> <br/>On an analysis of the impugned judgment and decree dated 16.5.1991 our view is that the reasons given by the trial Court below for passing the decree in favour of the  defendant respondent No. 1 are not sustainable either in law or on facts. In this appeal, we are surprised to notice how a Subordinate Judge dealt  with some irrelevant facts on the basis of un-corroborative oral evidence of DW-1 giving a go by to the admitted documentary evidence namely, original deed of mortgaged property (Ext.6),  loan sanction letter (Ext.7), mortgage  deed (Ext.8) and power of attorney (Ext.9). In fact, there is nothing on record to suggest that the defendant-respondent in the facts and circumstance of the case made a scapegoat or he did not receive any loan amount from the appellant-bank.<br/> <br/>For the reasons stated above the impu-gned judgment and decree of the Subordinate Judge and Artha Rin Adalat, Mymensingh does not deserve to be sustained.<br/> <br/>In the result, the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment and decree dated 16.5.1991 (decree signed on 26.5.1991) passed by the learned Subordinate Judge and Artha Rin Adalat, Mymensingh in Mortgage Suit No. 94 of 1990 so far it relates to defendant-respondent No.1 is set-aside and accordingly, the suit is hereby decreed against both the defendant-respondents.<br/> <br/>Let a copy of this judgment along with lower Court’s record be sent down at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Thereby the petitioner the Editor of that Weekly “Jai Jai Din” committed the offence prescribed in Sections 501, 502 of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/>On receipt of the complaint the learned Magistrate took cognizance of the offence under the aforesaid sections. Thereafter the petitioner surrendered in the Court below and enlarged on bail.<br/> <br/>Feeling aggrieved by the aforesaid proceedings the petitioner preferred the instant application and obtained the present Rule.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner supports the Rule and submits that the written word in question being subject-matter of complaint in the impugned proceedings does not disclose any offence inasmuch as those words do not by any stretch of imagination demeanour the opposite party nor they are capable of imputation of any meaning or sense purporting nor those words are written with any intent thereof. He adds that the petitioner never had any intention of hurting any feeling of anybody or person, religious or otherwise or to defame in any manner whatsoever. Those words which are objected to merely contain a reference a letter only in capable of any innuendo as has been imputed to and that the petitioner never in his wildest thought that it could ever be linked with any religious feeling. It was merely part of a joke and an imaginary story as often the jokes are so made and this is a common joke used as adult joke in many Arabs Countries. He adds that the petitioner was never aware that this was capable of hurting the feeling of any individual religion or otherwise. He adds that in taking objection to the joke on the ground as he did unreasonable as because there is no nexus between the joke and religion or the Holy Quran. Yet the petitioner having shown respect even for such unreasonable and irrational emotion as he referred to a letter in the Holy Quran, the petitioner soon published a clarification in the 34<sup>th</sup> issue in a prominent manner further explaining that the story as was written in 31<sup>st</sup> Issue was merely a joke and it has no innuendo whatsoever of religion and even though it was not capable of any such innuendo as alleged the petitioner’s expressed his profound and sincere regret for the same. He adds that the written words in question having not disclosed any offence, the compl-aint is unjustifiable, unreasonable and has tendency to harass the petitioner and it further has the tendency of infringing the right to free expression. He adds that it is not the petitioner who has created any innuendo or maligned anybody or person, but it is the opposite party who is putting a false innuendo and thereby maligning the petitioner with a charge which is false and most heinous and tends to address to some kind of blind irrational emotion for nothing and with any justifiable basis. He lastly submits that the continuation of the proceedings not only causes unnecessary and illegal harassment to the petitioner but also tends to create and increase false tention and emotion against the petitioner which the petitioner does not deserve.<br/> <br/>The learned Assistant Attorney General appearing for the opposite party no. 2 opposes the Rule and submits that the allegations as made in the complaint will come within the mischief of section 501 of the Penal Code so the Court below rightly took cognizance of the offence which calls for no interference by this Court.<br/> <br/>In order to appreciate their submissions we have gone through the record and given our anxious consideration to their submissions.<br/> <br/>On going to the materials on record it transpires that the complainant Mohammad Hasanul Alam alleged that the subject-matter of the publication has hurt his religious feelings and he became shocked as the letter Alif is one of the letters used in the Holy Quran, and that part of the writing is obscene.<br/> <br/>We have carefully examined the allegations made in the petition of complaint.<br/> <br/>For the convenience of understanding Sections 499 and 501 read as hereunder:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>    499- Defamation-Whoever by words either spoken or intended to be read, or by signs or by visible representations, makes or publishes any imputation concerning any person intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm, the reputation of such person, is said, except in the case hereinafter excepted, to defame that person.”<br/><br/>    501- Printing or engraving matter known to be defamatory- Whoever prints or engraves any matter, knowing or having good reason to believe that such matter is defamatory of any person, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It is pertinent to point out that after publishing the same the publisher herein petitioner published a re-joinder in the following manner:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“বর্ষ ৪ সংখ্যা ৩৪ মঙ্গলবার ৩০ ন­­ভম্বর, ১৯৯৩ দামঃ পাঁচ টাকা<br/>“যায় যায় দিন”<br/>     যায় যায় দিন এর ৯ ন­ভেম্বর সংখ্যার দি­­নর পর দিন কলা­মের শে­ষে গল্পটি নিছক কৌতুহল হিসা­বেই ছাপা হয়েছে। আরবি ভাষায় কেবলমাত্র মুসলমানরাই  কথা ব­­লন না - অন্য ধর্মাবলম্বী­­দর ম­­ধ্যও আরবি ভাষাভাষী লোকজন রয়েছেন। তাছাড়া ওই রচনাটির কোন অং­শই কো­­না ধর্ম সম্প­র্কে কো­­না ধর­­নর ইঙ্গিত করা হয়নি। তারপরও যদি ওই গল্পটি কা­­রা অনুভূতিতে আঘাত দি­য়ে থা­কে তাহ­­ল সে জন্য আমরা আন্তরিকভা­­ব দুঃখিত। কাউ­কে কো­ন ভা­­ব দুঃখ দেয়াই ওই কৌতুকের উ­দ্দেশ্য নয়।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>On plain reading of the Provisions of section 499 of the Penal Code, we find that whoever makes or publishes any imputation concerning any person intending to harm or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm, the reputation of such person, is said to defame that person. The explanation 4 provides that no imputation is said to harm a person’s reputation, unless that imputation directly or indirectly, in the estimation of others, lowers the moral or intellectual character of that person, or lowers the character of that person, in respect of his caste or of his calling, or lowers the credit of that person, or causes it to be believed that the body of that person is in a loathsome state, or in a state generally considered as disgraceful. Moreso, in view of third exception of the above Provision, subject-matter of printing is not defamation inasmuchas the opinion or joke was expressed in good faith not to harm the reputation of any person.  Therefore we hold that the word used in the subject-matter of defamation is not a matter to hurt the religious feeling of the complainant in any manner whatsoever.<br/> <br/>Moreso, in the re-joinder the petitioner expressed his sincere regret for publishing the same stating that it has done in good faith, and he had no intention to hurt anyone of his religious feelings. Therefore we hold that the continuation of the proceedings adopted and constituted against the petitioner in the aforesaid case is abuses of the process of the Court which is liable to be quashed. Thus the Rule having merit succeeds. <br/> <br/>In view of the foregoing narrative the Rule is made absolute. The proceedings of C.R. case no. 498 of 1993 pending in the Court of Magistrate, first Class, Rangpur is hereby quashed.<br/> <br/>Office is directed to communicate the order at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>
