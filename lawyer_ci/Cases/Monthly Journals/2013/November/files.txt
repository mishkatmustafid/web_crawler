Abu Zafor Siddique, J:</u></strong></span><br/> <br/>This Jail Appeal is directed against the judgment and order of conviction and sentenced dated 14.02.2006 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Comilla in Sessions Trial Case No.99 of 2005 arising out of Kotwali Police Station Case No.12 dated 05.01.2005, corresponding to G.R. No.11 of 2005 convicting the accused-appellant under section 302 of the Penal Code and sentencing him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life and pay a fine of Tk.20,000/- in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 1(one) year more.<br/><br/>The prosecution case, in short, is that the informant, having his posting at Sadar Traffic of Comilla District Town, was duty on 05.01.2005 at 14.00 to 18.00 hours along with traffic constable Selim, when on duty constable Selim cried out for help. At that time, the infor-mant saw a man running away with a knife in his hand and he also found constable Selim with stab injury on his abdomen, chest and head and the informant then took step to take Selim to the Sadar hospital. Police Sergeant Mahmudul Hasan followed the informant to the hospital. The victim was provided primary treatment and sent to Comilla Medical College Hospital for better treatment, but the victim Selim died at 18.15 hours.<br/><br/>Sergeant Mahamudul Hasan informed the matter to the higher authority and all concerned and came to know that the assailant was a rickshaw puller. The police arrested him and on interrogation, the accused confessed his guilt and disclosed his name as Abu Bakar Siddique alias Badal S/O A. Rashid of Village Siramgari, under P.S. Lalpur of District Nator. Thereafter the informant lodged the ejahar.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Humayan Kabir, Sub-Inspector of Police, Kotwaly Police Station, Comilla, investigated the case. During investigation, he visited the place of occurrence, prepared sketch map along with index and recorded statements of the witnesses under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The investigating officer prepared inquest report and arrangement for post mortem of the deceased. Thereafter he also made arrangement for recording the confessional statement of the accused before the learned Magistrate, Ist Class, Comilla under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. After investigation, having found prima-facie case, he submitted charge-sheet under section 302 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>After investigation, the case record was transmitted to the learned Sessions Judge, Comilla and it was registered as Sessions Trial Case No.99 of 2005 thereafter, cognizance was taken and charge was framed against the convict-appellant under section 302 of the Penal Code and the same was read over and explained to him and the accused pleaded not guilty and he prayed to be tried in accordance with law.<br/><br/>During trial, the prosecution examined as many as 12 witnesses out of 17 cited witnesses in the charge-sheet, but the defence examined none.<br/><br/>The defence case, as it appears from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses, is that the appellant is completely innocent and he has been falsely implicated in the case out of enmity and no murder had been committed by the accused-person.<br/><br/>After conclusion of the hearing of both parties and on consideration of the evidence and the materials on record and in view of the facts and circumstances of the case the learned Sessions Judge, Comilla came to the finding that the prosecution proved the charge beyond all reasonable doubt and accordingly, the Court below convicted the accused.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence, the convict-appellant preferred the instant jail appeal through Comilla Jail authority for setting aside the judgment and order dated 14.02.2006 passed by the Court below.<br/><br/>Mrs. Hasna Begum, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant submits that the learned Sessions Judge, Comilla has misread the evidence and misinterpreted the law and thus passed the judgment and order of conviction which is not tenable in the eye of law. She has further submitted that the prosecution has miserable failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, since there is no eye witness to the occurrence. Moreover, the convict-appellant had no pre-plan to commit alleged murder. She has further submitted that the convict-appellant had no intention to kill the deceased Selim. As such, the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>On the other hand Mr. Md. Fazlur Rahman Khan, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing on behalf of the State, has supported the impugned judgment passed by the trial Court and submits that the prosecution by producing sufficient evidence has been able to prove the case beyond all reasonable doubt. He further submitted that the convict-appellant made a confessional statement before the Magistrate under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and as such, there is nothing to be interfered by this Court and accordingly, the appeal is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>We have heard the submission of both the sides and perused the impugned judgment of the trial Court and materials on record including the evidence adduced by the prosecution. For proper appreciation, the evidence is briefly discussed bellow.<br/><br/>P.W.1, Moin Uddin, constable of police, supported the prosecution case.

On the evidence on record of the prosecution witnesses, it apparent that there is no pre-plan by the convict-appellant to murder of the traffic police. Rather, as evident from the statement made by the appellant himself under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the Magistrate, 1<sup>st</sup> Class, Comilla, the appellant was facing extreme mental pressure for the reason that- “গত কাল ৫/১/২০০৫ তারিখ সকাল ১১.০০ টার দিকে কান্দিরপাড় লিবার্ঢি~ সিনেমার সামনে ট্রাফিক মোড়ে ট্রাফিক সেলিম আমাকে লাঠি দিয়ে কয়েকটা বারি মারে এবং আমার রিক্সার চাকার সব ¯Œzd ভেংগে ফেলে, তার মার খেয়ে আমার সহ্য হয় নাই।”<br/><br/>From the above circumstances, it is abundantly clear that there was no pre-plan to commit the murder. Therefore, the offence would not fall within the purview of section 302 of the Penal Code; rather all the elements are present in the instant case to indicate that the offence would attract the exception as laid down in section 300 of the Penal Code, and accordingly, the appellant would be guilty of the murder under part-II of section 304 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>Having regards to the facts and circumstances of the case and the statement made by the appellant under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, we are inclined to hold that the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 14.02.2006, so far as it relates to the sentence, is liable to be interfered.<br/><br/>We have also taken note of the fact that at the relevant time, the appellant was only 35 years. By this time, a period of 8 years has elapsed and during this enter period from the date of his arrest i.e. on and from 06.01.2005, he has been in custody till date.<br/><br/>In the result, the appeal is allowed in part.<br/><br/>The impugned judgment and order dated 14.02.2006, so far as it relates to the conviction of accused, is upheld.<br/><br/>However, the conviction under section 302 of the Penal Code is hereby altered to one under Part-II of section 304 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>Therefore, the sentence of imprisonment for life is reduced to a period of 10(ten) years that the appellant has already served as per Jail Code.<br/><br/>The imposition of the fine of taka 20,000/- in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonnment for 1(one) year is hereby waived.<br/><br/>The appellant Abu Bakkor Siddique alias Badal, son of Abdur Rashid be set at liberty forthwith, if not wanted in connected with any other case.<br/><br/>The office is directed to send down the lawyer court records along with a copy of the judgment at once.    <br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

The appeal before the Tribunal was filed against order No.289/07 dated 04.11.2007 passed by the Commissioner, Customs Bond Commissionerate, Dhaka demanding Taka 2,3108,831.43 (two crore thirty-one lac eight thousand eight hundred thirty-one and Paisa forty-three) only as customs duties and taxes from the appellant-company and imposing penalty of Taka 1,50,00,000/= (one crore and fifty lac) not in-bonding raw materials imported under bond facility and failing to produce any documents to show that the goods manufactured by the raw materials were subsequently exported.<br/><br/>Mr. A. M. Aminuddin, learned Advocate for the appellants in all the appeals with reference to an unreported judgment analogously passed in Customs Appeal No. 17 of 2008 with two other customs appeals, wherein he himself appeared as an intervener, submits that since it has already been decided that a customs appeal under section 196D of the Customs Act against an order of dismissal of appeal for not depositing duties, taxes and fine as required by section 194 of the said Act is not maintainable, he should not argue the case on merit so that the appellants can approach with their respective cases in appropriate forum.<br/>Mr. Pratikar Chakma, learned Assistant Attorney General appearing for the respondents does not find any reason to oppose the submissions of Mr. Aminuddin.<br/><br/>We have gone through the record and examined the impugned orders in all the four appeals. It appears that the Customs, Excise and Vat Appellate Tribunal, Dhaka dismissed the appeals for not depositing money as required by section 194 of the Customs Act. A customs appeal before the High Court Division is governed, amongst others, by section 196D read with section 196B of Customs Act. For better appreciation of law, these are quoted below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em><u>“</u></em><em><u>196B: Orders of Appellate Tribunal.- (1) The Appellate Tribunal may, after giving the parties to the appeal, an opportunity of being heard, pass such order thereon as it thinks fit, confirming, modifying or annulling the decision or order appealed against[or may refer the case back to the authority which passed such decision or order with such directions as the Appellate Tribunal may think fit, for a fresh adjudication or decision, as the case may be, after taking additional evidence, if necessary.</u></em> (Emphasis supplied)<br/><br/><em>2) The Appellate Tribunal may, at any time within four years from the date of the order, with a view to rectifying any mistake apparent from the record, amend any order passed by it under sub-section (1) and shall make such amendments if the mistake is brought to its notice by the Commissioner of Customs or the other party to the appeal: </em><br/><br/><em>Provided that an amendment which has the effect of enhancing the assessment or reducing a refund or otherwise increasing the liability of the other party shall not be made under this sub-section, unless the Appellate Tribunal has given notice to him of its intention to do so and has allowed him a reasonable opportunity of being heard. </em><br/><br/><em>The Appellate Tribunal shall send a copy of every order passed under this section to the Commissioner of Customs and the other party to the appeal. </em><br/><br/><em>4) Save as otherwise provided in section 196D, orders passed by the Appellate Tribunal on appeal shall be final </em><br/><br/><strong><em>“</em></strong><em>196D: Appeal to the High Court Division.</em><strong><em>- </em></strong><em>The Commissioner of Customs or the other party may, within ninety days of the date upon which he is served with notice of <u>an order under section 196B,</u> by an application, prefer an appeal to the High Court Division against such order.</em>” (Emphasis supplied)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From a careful reading of the aforequoted sections of the Customs Act, it comes out that a customs appeal under section 196D lies before the High Court Division against an order passed under section 196B after hearing of the parties on merit by the Customs, Excise and VAT Appellate Tribunal in an appeal preferred before it within the scope of law. Any order of dismissal of appeal filed under section 196 A for not depositing duty and/or fine as required under section 194, which is a precondition of considering any such appeal by the Customs Excise and VAT Appellate Tribunal, cannot be said to have been passed under section 196B. The law does not confer any jurisdiction on this Court to entertain any appeal against an order, which is not passed under section 196B of the Act.<br/><br/>This view also lends support from the aforesaid decision of Customs Appeal No.17 of 2008 analogously passed with two others customs appeals, wherein one of us was a party.<br/><br/>Since the orders in question before us are not the orders passed under section 196B of the Customs Act, the instant appeals under section 196D are not maintainable. Accordingly all the customs appeals are dismissed as being not maintainable.<br/><br/>         Communicate the orders and send down the records.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

Ruhul Quddus, J: </strong></u></span><br/> <br/>This appeal at the instance of a compl-ainant is preferred under section 417(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure against judgment and order dated 9.11.1994 passed by the Magistrate of first class, Pabna acquitting the respondent from charge under sections 406 and 420 of the Penal Code in C. R. Case No.192 of 1992 and commencing proceedings against the complainant under section 250 of the Code by issuing a notice upon him. The appeal has been appearing in the cause list since 4.4.2011 i.e. six days before starting of the vacation. Today it is taken up for hearing but no one appears for either of the parties. In view of its long pendency for more than sixteen years, we take it up for disposal.<br/><br/>Facts relevant for disposal of the appeal, in brief, are that the appellant as complainant filed a petition of complaint before the Thana Magistrate, Santhia, Pabna on 31.12.1991 alleging <em>inter alia</em> that he was the Loan Officer of Santhia T.C.C.A (Thana Central Co-operative Association), an association of cooperative societies. The respondent being a member of Dhopadaha Uttarpara Krishak Shomobyai Shamity bought two shallow pump machines namely, Duez-210 and Yanmar-105 on 5.1.1981 and 20.11.1981 respectively taking loan of Taka 24,060/= for Duez-210 machine and Taka 20,420/= for the Yanmar-105. It was stipulated that he would pay the entire install-ments against the Duez-210 within 30.9.1986 and against the Yanmar-105 within 31.3.1987. But he sold the said machines elsewhere without paying any subsequent monthly installment and misappropriated total Taka 2,58,961/= including the interest. In spite of service of notice, he did not pay off the loan although executed a written undertaking for payment of loan in favour of the T.C.C.A. In this way the respondent had committed offence of criminal breach of trust and cheating.<br/><br/>On receipt of the said complaint, the Thana Magistrate took cognizance of offence against the respondent under sections 406 and 420 of the Penal Code and issued warrant of arrest against him. The respondent voluntarily appeared before the Court and obtained bail on 24.2.1993. Thereafter, the case was sent to the Magistrate of first class (Md. Anisur Rahman), Pabna for hearing and disposal. The learned Magistrate by his order dated 17.7.1993 framed charge against him under the said penal sections, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/><br/>The prosecution in order to prove the case examined three witnesses including the complainant and two employees of the T.C.C.A. After closing the prosecution, the learned Magistrate examined the respondent under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to which he reiterated his innocence, but did not adduce any evidence in defense. The defense case as it transpires from the trend of the cross-examination that the respondent was innocent, he did not purchase any machine and was falsely implicated in the case. <br/><br/>After conclusion of trial, the learned Magistrate passed the impugned judgment and order of acquittal commencing the proceedings under section 250 of the Code, as aforesaid. Against the said judgment and order, the complainant moved in this Court with the instant criminal appeal. <br/><br/>It appears that P.W. 1, the complainant Md. Borkat Ali deposed in full support of the complaint case. He proved the petition of complaint and his signature thereon as exhibits-1 and 1/1 respectively, but did not adduce in evidence any loan sanction letter, money receipt, agreement or undertaking in support of the loan or purchase of machines. In cross-examination he stated that he himself did not hand over the pump machines to the respondent. He further stated that earlier he had filed C. R. Case No.183 of 1991 under sections 406 and 420 of the Penal Code against the same accused, but subsequently withdrew from the case on 23.10.1992. In that case he made allegation in respect of only Duez-210 pump machine and admitted that he had no claim in respect of another. He also admitted that the Rural Development Officer served a notice upon the respondent on 27.4.1992, wherein claim for only one machine was raised and there was no mention about the other machine.<br/><br/>P.W.2 M. A. Samad, an Inspector of Santhia T.C.C.A. though corroborated P.W.1, did not adduce any documentary evidence. In cross-examination he stated that at the relevant period he was not assigned for Dhopadah Krishak Shomobyai Shamity and further stated that he himself did not hand over any Duez-210 pump machine to the respondent.<br/><br/>P.W.3 Md. Kamrul Alam, another Inspector of the T.C.C.A. deposed corroborating the evidence of P.Ws. 1-2. He also did not adduce any documentary evidence. In cross-examination he stated that he himself did not hand over any Duez-210 pump machine to the respondent and was not present at the time of delivery of Yanmar-105 machine.  <br/><br/>According to the prosecution case, loan against two shallow pump machines were given by Santhia T.C.C.A to the respondent. It was done in due course of official transaction of the T.C.C.A. But none of the witnesses adduced in evidence any loan sanction letter, receipt, agreement or undertaking in support of the loan or purchase of pump machines, and all of them stated that they were not present at the time of delivery of the machines. In such a position it cannot be said that disbursement of loan against purchase of two pump machines as alleged in the complaint was proved, especially when the case was denied by the defense.<br/><br/>The complainant himself as P.W.1 deposed that notice was served upon the respondent in respect of Duez-210 machine and they had no claim over the other machine (meaning the Yanmar-105). The previous case filed in respect of Duez-210 was also withdrawn. Therefore, the present case on allegation of misappropriation of loan against two machines is not believable.<br/><br/>In view of the above discussion we do not find that the impugned judgment of the learned Magistrate is perverse, or so unreasonable that it would amount to miscarriage of justice, so far it relates to acquittal of the respondent. But at the same time we hold that the prosecution case has not been proved against the respondent for want of documentary evidence, which does not mean that the case was false and frivolous or vexatious. There is no satisfaction on the part of the learned Magistrate that the case was knowingly false and the complaint case was brought with some ulterior motive i.e to harass the accused or bring pressure on him to achieve some other purpose. Moreover, the complainant had initiated the present case in his capacity as Loan Officer of Santhia T.C.C.A, an association of cooperative societies. He was a mere employee in the said co-operative association and supposed to act under instruction of the concerned authority. The complainant should not be prosecuted for initiation of such a case and therefore, we are inclined to modify the judgment discharging him from the proceedings under section 250 of the Code commenced with passing of the impugned judgment. <br/><br/>In the result, the appeal is dismissed with modification. The complainant Md. Borkat Ali, Loan Officer, Santhia T.C.C.A is discharged from the proceedings under section 250 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/>Send down the lower Court records.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div><div><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"> </div></div></div></div>

Moazzam Husain, J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This appeal arises out of a judgment and order dated 14.3.2007 passed by the Special Tribunal No. 5. Chittagong, convicting the appellant (sole accused) under section 19A and 19(f) of the Arms Act and sentencing him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and 7 years respectively under those sections of law making the sentences to run concurrently.<br/> <br/>The case arose out of a first information report, shortly, “the FIR” lodged by one Dilwara Begum with Rawjan police station at about 14.30 hours on 17.2.2002. The story as alleged in the FIR, in short, is that the accused entered into the dwelling hut of the informant despite her opposition. He then emerged a revolver, pointed at her and charged her saying, ‘despite repeated requests why she did not pay money’. He said he   would kill them all this time. At an opportune moment she and her sister-in-law (second wife of her husband) hooked the door up from outside; caught hold of the accused with the revolver and raised hue and cry. Having heard the hue and cry Abdur Rahim, her brother-in-law (husband’s elder brother), Abdul Mannan, Mohammad Ali, Monaiya and many others came to the spot and heard about as well saw for themselves the occurrence. They all tied up the accused and were planning for giving information to the nearest police station. Meanwhile police came to the scene of occurrence having had information from sources not known to the informant. Having got the police at the spot they handed over the accused with the revolver with five round bullets. Police being satisfied that the accused did not have valid papers in support of the possession of the arms and ammunitions seized the same on the spot by a seizure list duly signed by the witnesses.<br/> <br/>The FIR gave rise to Rawjan Police Station Case No.11 dated 17.2.2002 under sections 19A and 19(f) of the Arms Act. Police, after investigations, submitted charge sheet against the appellant under the aforesaid sections of law and upon submission of charge-sheet the case was sent up to the Special Tribunal, Chittagong for trial wherein the same was registered as Special Tribunal Case No. 92 of 2002.<br/> <br/>The case was put on trial before the Special Tribunal No.5, Chittagong.  Learned Judge of the Tribunal framed charges against the appellant under sections 19A and 19(f) of the Arms Act to which the appellant pleaded not guilty. Six witnesses including the informant were   examined on behalf of the prosecution. The investigating officer could not be examined as he did not turn up during trial. The appellant cross-examined the witnesses himself.<br/> <br/>Learned Judge, upon trial found the appellant guilty of the charges framed against him and convicted and sentenced him under both the sections to suffer rigorous imprisonment for a period of 10 years under section 19A and 7 years under section 19(f) of the Arms Act. Learned Judge, however, made both the sentences to run concurrently. The appellant was found guilty essentially on the findings as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>   ‘‘এজাহারকারিনী ..এজাহারে উল্লিখিত ঘটনার বিবরণ তাহার সাক্ষ্য হুবহু পূণর্ব্যক্ত করেন।   পি, ডব্লিউ-২ কৃষিকাজ করাকালীন  হৈ চৈ শুনিয়া ঘটনাস্থলে যান । আসামীর নিকট হইতে রিভলভার কাড়িয়া লন। পি, ডব্লিউ-৩  এজাহারকারিন£র সতিন। তিনি তাহার সাক্ষ্যে বলেন আসামী  এজাহারকারিনীৃর  বসতঘরে ঢোকার পর বাহির হইতে শিকল আটকাইয়া চিৎকার দিলে আশেপাশের লোকজন আসে  এবং  আসামীর কাছ থেকে অস্ত্র ও গুলি উদ্ধার করে।"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>As the FIR version goes, out of six witnesses examined on behalf of the prosecution none was an eye witness except PW-1 and 3, ie, the informant and her sister-in-law. Except those two witnesses all others admittedly came to the spot having heard the hue and cry raised by them and, as per FIR, after they had seized of the accused and the arms. Relevant portion of the FIR (Ext.1) reads as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>   ‘‘আমি ও আমার সতিন  জোহরা খাতুন সুযোগ বুঝিয়া  আমাদের  ঘরের বাহিরের দরজার শিকল আটকাইয়া আমরা দুই সতীনে উক্ত আসামী  মো: ফিরোজকে  উল্লিখিত অগ্নেয়াস্ত্রসহ  ধরিয়া ফেলিয়া   ডাকচিৎকার দেই।"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In view of the FIR story the findings of the learned judge that -the neighboring people having heard hue and cry came and recovered the arms and ammunitions from the possession of the accused- apparently runs contrary to the FIR version. PW.3 who is said to be present at the time of occurrence did not support the mode of recovery of arms and ammunitions from the possession of the appellant and practically has taken a departure from the FIR story saying that-  অামার ভাসুর অা: রহিম অস্ত্রটি অাসামীর হাত থেকে নিয়েছে। So is the case with PW. 2, ie, brother-in-law of the informant who said -অামি দেখি অাসামীকে ঘরে অাটক করে রেখেছে, তার হাতে একটি রিভলভার ছিলো। সেই রিভলভার অামি কেড়ে নেই- Other witnesses are admittedly hearsay at least as far as the recovery of arms is concerned. The mode of recovery of arms disclosed in the FIR and the statements made by the witnesses to that effect thus leaves the factum of recovery unclear and do not permit safe inference of recovery of arms etc. from the appellant.<br/> <br/>A close scrutiny of the prosecution case is clearly suggestive of the fact that the story set out in the FIR is utterly unbelievable in that the story of an armed man being hauled up by two unarmed women as is stated in the FIR and thereafter taking control of him with his arms and gathering people by shouting is incompatible with the ordinary course of events.  It is not clear how they trapped a full-grown armed man in a so-called opportune moment.  There is nothing on records to show the exact condition of the room in terms of its nature, walls, doors, windows and lock-up devices so as to assess the possibility of confinement of  an armed man, as the appellant allegedly was. It is unclear how a person can see from outside one who is confined in a room, as PW.2 did.<br/> <br/>As is manifest from evidence that the family from where the appellant allegedly tried to extort money at gun point was a poor family of a person wanted in a number of cases and had long been in prison. Moreover, he maintains two wives. The economic condition of the family is fairly understandable. Pertinent question immediately crosses a reasonable mind what prompted an otherwise sane man to insist for  money from a wretched family of the kind and to go there  for money more so with gun that too  at broad daylight.  How could he conceive the idea that, of all the people, the two destitute wives of a poor prisoner were in a position to pay him money.<br/> <br/>Another aspect of the case cannot but draw attention. The occurrence took place at 10 O’clock in the morning. Policemen reportedly, came to the spot soon thereafter. Seizure list was prepared at 11 in the morning. Seizure-list (Ext.2) shows overwriting on “1100 hrs” making the same “1300 hrs.” as the time for its preparation. The manipulation is manifest from the fact that it is written in Bangla as:  সকাল ১৩.০০ ঘটিকার সময়।  “1300 hrs” cannot be called “morning” in any case.  It is, therefore, clear that police went to the spot before 11 in the morning. Curiously, the first police party who reached immediately after the occurrence chose to remain silent about the occurrence. They allowed 3½ hours for the complaint petition to be drafted and lodged in the police station at 13½ hrs which contains technical description of the arms as ‘revolver’ and the ‘type’ as capable of using bullets of 22 bore rifle. The technical name and type of the arms cannot be known to an illiterate woman like the informant. In view of the above coupled with the delay in lodging FIR likelihood of fabrication cannot be ruled out. <br/> <br/>The identification of the revolver and bullets in court, as is done, is open to doubt.  The internal infirmities of the case read with the apparently inconsistent versions of recovery of arms given by different witnesses make the prosecution case doubtful.<br/> <br/>Furthermore, the factum that PWs 1 and 3 are members of a criminal family seeks to impair their credibility as witnesses. It is unsafe to place reliance on their evidence unless supported by independent and reliable witnesses. We do not find any such witness to support their case to the satisfaction of the court. It follows, therefore, that the prosecution has failed to bring home the charges brought against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. Learned Judge appears to have given a total go-by to the need for assessment of evidence in their legal and factual perspective and made a short-cut to conclusion just on the face value of the statements made by three witnesses of highly doubtful credibility.<br/> <br/>Charges are framed against the appellant under sections 19A and 19(f) of the Arms Act. Learned Judge alongside charges framed issues exactly as it is done in law- suits and seems to have directed himself on the issues in coming to his findings. The issues as framed are:</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">এজাহার বর্ণিত ঘটনার তারিখ ও সময়ে অাসামী অবৈধ অস্ত্র ও গুলি  লাইসেন্স ব্যতিরেকে নিজ দথল ও নিয়ন্ত্রনে রাখিয়াছিলেন কিনা</li><li style="text-align: justify;">প্রসিকিউশন পক্ষ অাসামীর বিরুদ্ধে অানীত অভিযোগ সন্দেহাতীতভাবে প্রমানে সক্ষম হইয়াছেন কিনা।</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">The issues framed in addition to the specific charges might have been fatal had the second issue was not there in the sense that mere possession and control of unlicensed arms at a particular place and time may not always constitute offence. Such possession and control, to constitute offence, must come within the technical meaning of law.<br/> <br/>Framing of issues in criminal cases stands in contrast with criminal jurisprudence. In criminal cases it is the offence which is tried. Offences remain defined in penal clauses with all their intricacies communication of which in any language other than the technical language of law is not possible without and amount of risk of miscommunication. Code of Criminal Procedure, in its Chapter XIX, has taken adequate care about the language of charge to make sure that the accused is not prejudiced in his defense on the score of communication of the offence he is proposed to be tried upon. It is, therefore, not permissible under law to introduce any other device, in the form of issues or otherwise, as substitute or supplement of ‘charge’ into the scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/> <br/>Another aspect of this case is non-examination of the Investigating Officer which seems to have been slided over by the learned Judge. Non-examination of the Investigating Officer may, in certain circumstances, be fatal if it could be shown that by that way the accused is substantially prejudiced in his defense. In the peculiar facts of the present case it is most likely that such non-examination has prejudiced the accused in his defense which otherwise might have entitled him to benefit of doubt.<br/> <br/>For all the reasons states above we find merit in this appeal. The appeal is, accordingly, allowed. The impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence are set aside. The appellant is acquitted of the charges brought against him. Let the appellant, Md. Firoz, be set at liberty at once if not wanted in any other connection.<br/><br/>Send down the L/C records along with a copy of this judgment expeditiously.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

Moazzam Husain, J:</u></strong><br/> <br/>This rule at the instance of the second- party employer, was issued calling in question the judgment and order dated 29.5.2008 passed by the Labour Appellate Tribunal, Dhaka in Appeal No.2 of 2008 affirming those of the First Labour Court, Chittagong in IRO Case No. 33 of 2006.<br/> <br/>Facts leading to this rule, briefly stated, are that the first party respondent filed the IRO case under section 34 of the Industrial Relations Ordinance, 1969, (“the IRO” for short) in the First Labour Court Chittagong, alleging, <em>inter alia,</em> that  he is a permanent worker  serving in the  petitioner-company. His service record is satisfactory and he was elected CBA president on several terms. The petitioner by  a general notification issued <em>vide</em> Memo dated 29.12.2005 brought, amongst other things, to the notice of the first party respondent  an incorrect date of birth against his name which virtually curtailed around two years time from the length of service he is entitled to. <br/> <br/>Further case of the first party respondent is that he submitted SSC certificate and a testimonial along with the application for employment. According to SSC certificate his date of birth is 15.6.1952. Therefore, there is no scope of dispute or confusion about his date of birth. As per section 14A of the Public Corporation (Management Coordination) Ordinance, 1986, shortly, “the Ordinance of 1986” the retiring age of the workers of all public corporations and allied bodies was enhanced from 57 to 60 years. In view of the said Ordinance the respondent as a worker is entitled to retire on completion of 60 years of his age. And accordingly date of his retirement becomes due on 15.6.2012.  The first party respondent sent by registered mail a representation dated 27.7.2006 addressing the petitioner enclosing copies of all the necessary papers and documents requesting   correction of the official records containing disputed entry as to his age. The petitioner received the application but did not take any step nor was the respondent informed about the fate of his petition. The respondent was not allowed to see for himself his service book/register either.<br/> <br/>The petitioner as second party contested the case by filing written objection stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that the respondent made an application for employment on 27.8.1974. He was appointed as Mechanical Helper on 01.10.1974. At the time of making application the respondent did not file his SSC certificate. He rather mentioned in his application that he was 24 years of age. On that basis his date of birth was noted in his service book as 27.8.1950. The date of birth continued in the successive voters’ lists of the office.  The respondent was promoted to the post of ‘Master Technician’ on 30.6.1985. The post of Master Technician is included in the national pay scale and none serving in the national pay scale can be a ‘worker’ under the law.<br/> <br/>As per rule 9 of Bangladesh Service Rules (hereinafter referred to as “the BSR”) the date of birth declared by the public servant in his/her application for service is binding on the applicant for the purpose of calculation of the date of retirement. The respondent declared his age as 24 years in his application. On that basis his date of birth squares with 27.8.1950. The respondent not being a worker the extended age of retirement provided by the Ordinance of 1986 is not applicable to him.  As an employee under the national pay scale his service is invariably limited to 57 years. Moreover, sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 28 of the present Bangladesh Srama Ain, 2006, shortly, “Srama Ain,” have fixed the retirement age of the workers at 57 years to be calculated from the date of birth declared in the application for the job. Thus, there is no scope for correction of date of birth declared at the time of entry into service or entitlement of extended age of retirement.<br/> <br/>The Labour Court took up the case for trial. The first party respondent examined himself as PW.1 and, among other things, he proved his SSC certificate (Ext.1), passport (Ext.2), Freedom Fighters’ Certificate (Ext.3),-all testifying his date of birth as claimed by him. He also proved the list of LPR-2007 dated 02.02.2007 (Ext.6) issued from the office of the petitioner showing 26.8.2007 as his date of retirement. <br/> <br/>The petitioner as second party did not examine any witness nor did produce any papers or documents in support of its case. An inquiry report by Comilla Education Board was, however, produced before the court at the instance of the petitioner which instead of helping the petitioner company supported the case of the respondent.  Trial Court allowed the case with the observations, <em>inter alia</em>, that the complainant is a worker within the meaning of section 2(v) of the Employment of Labour (Standing Order) Act, 1965 as well as section 2(XXVIII) of the IRO. He passed his SSC Examination six years before his entry into service and the SSC certificate testifies his date of birth as claimed.  Nothing to the contrary is proved by the second party. Trial court further found that the fist party respondent comes within the definition of worker under Ordinance of 1986. He, in that sense, is entitled to enhanced age of retirement.<br/> <br/>On appeal the Appellate Tribunal made the similar findings in apparently stronger language used touching upon the failure of the appellant employer to press home its case.<br/> <br/>The points essentially sought to be canvassed by Mr. <u>Zulfiqur </u>Bulbul Chowdhury are threefold, namely, that the case is not maintainable under section 34 of the IRO as the section is intended to enforce the ‘established right’ not to settle  new disputes as is sought to done by the respondent.  In support of his contention Mr. Zulfiqur Bulbul referred to the cases of Mozammel<em> Haque Chowdhury v Chairman, Labour Court &amp; another</em> reported in 10 BLC p 485. ; <em>Chairman Power Development Board &amp; others v Chairman, Labour Court, Khulna</em> reported in 1981 BLD (AD) p 59.; <em>Abdul Hamid v Chairman, Second Labour Court</em> reported in 29 DLR p 295 and <em>Bangladesh Marine Fisheries Association v Bangladesh</em> reported in 52 DLR p 274.<br/> <br/>Second limp of his argument was that the first party respondent is not a ‘worker’ as his post is included in the national pay scale. None serving in the national pay scale can be a ‘worker’ as per law. The respondent, therefore, is not entitled to extended age of retirement provided under the Ordinance of 1986. And finally, as per Rule-9 of the Bangladesh Service Rules and section 28 of the Srama Ain,  2006 the respondent is bound by the date of birth declared by him in his application for the job. There is no scope for change or modification of the same by subsequent production of papers or documents testifying otherwise.<br/> <br/>To take up the second point first, ie., whether the first party respondent is a ‘worker’ as contemplated under the Employment of Labour (Standing Order)Act,1985 and the IRO.  The Labour court appears to have addressed the point elaborately by reference to relevant sections of Employment of Labour (Standing Order) Act, 1965 and the IRO and came to the conclusion that the respondent is a worker.  The Tribunal affirmed the judgment primarily on the failure of the appellant to prove anything to the contrary.<br/> <br/>The definition of ‘worker’ given in section 2(v) of the Employment of Labour (Standing Order) Act, 1965, is as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong><em>Section 2(v):</em></strong><em> ‘worker’ means any person including an apprentice employed in any shop, commercial establishment or industrial establishment to do any skilled, unskilled, manual,  technical, trade promotional or clerical work for hire or reward, whther the terms of employment be expressed or implied, but does not include any such person-</em></div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>who is employed mainly in a managerial or administrative capacity ; or </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>who, being employed in a supervisory capacity, exercises, either by nature of the duties attached to officer or by reason of power vested in him, functions mainly of managerial or administrative nature.    </em></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Definition of a ‘worker’ given in section 2(XXVIII) of the IRO, reads as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong><em>“Section 2(xxviii):</em></strong><em> “worker” and “workmen” means any person including an apprentice not falling within the definition of employer who is employed in an establishment or industry for hire or reward either directly or through a contractor to do any skilled, unskilled, manual, technical or clerical work whether the terms of employment be expressed or implied and for the purpose of any proceeding under this Ordinance in relation to an industrial dispute includes a person who has been dismissed, discharged, retrenched, laid-off or otherwise removed from employment in connection with or as a consequence of that dispute or whose dismissal, discharge, retrenchment, lay-off or removal has led to that dispute, but does not include a person- </em></div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>employed as a member of the watch and ward or security staff or confidential assistant, cypher assistant of any establishment;</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>employed in a managerial or administrative capacity; </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>who being employed in a supervisory capacity performs, by virtue of the duties attached to his office or by reason of the powers given to him, functions of managerial or administrative nature. </em></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong><em>[Exception.</em></strong><em> Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-clause (a), a person employed as a member of the watch and ward   or security staff or confidential assistant or cypher assistant of any establishment shall be entitled to all financial benefits admissible to a worker or workman of similar grade or category.]”   </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>A bare reading of the sections of law quoted above suggests that pay-scale, national or local has nothing to do with the question of determination of a person’s status as ‘worker’. The petitioner did not come up with any authority or law to substantiate its point either. The contention of Mr. Bulbul that the respondent himself admitted that he used to do supervisory works, thus, he ceased to be a worker does not also commend to us. The exact statement made by the first party respondent is:  Avwg wb‡RI KvR Kwi &amp;Ges I‡`i KvR †`Lvïbv Kwi| The statement plainly means that the respondent alongside his own works does some supervisory works. Law quoted above can hardly be construed to mean that a person even if employed in supervisory capacity ceases to be a worker unless he performs, by virtue of the duties attached to his office or by reason of the powers given to him, functions of managerial or administrative nature.  No such case is made out by the petitioner.  Our considered view, therefore, is that the respondent is a ‘worker’ within the meaning of the Employment of Labour (Standing Order) Act, 1965 and the IRO.<br/> <br/>Reverting back to the first point, ie., a right yet to be settled is sought to be enforced by the respondent  which is not maintainable under section 34 of the Employment of Labour (Standing Order) Act, 1985.  Mr. Bulbul has taken pains to press home the point and tried to stress on the contention that production of SSC certificate at the fag end of one’s career is not only unacceptable in law but also amounts to fraud on the employer. We are unable to follow the logic of his contention. It is difficult to conceive in human conditions that a sane man possessed of unimpeachable evidence in his favour like SSC certificate instead of using it to his benefit would keep it undisclosed till the end of his career with a view to defrauding his employer. Among the cases he referred to on this point Mr. Bulbul seems to have placed considerable reliance on the case of Mozammel Haque Chowdhury<em> reported in </em>10 BLC p 485.<br/> <br/>In the said case a Division Bench of this Court while sitting upon a dispute of age raised by a worker took into notice the principle enunciated by our Appellate Division in the case of Power<em> Development Board (supra) </em>and made the following observation:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“…..determination of the age of the petitioner is not a right secured or guaranteed within the meaning of section 34 of the Ordinance.</em>”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the cited case the employer asserted that a specific date of birth was given by the worker himself at the time of entry into the service. His ACR contained the date of birth as given by him. According to the date of birth given by the worker his retirement order was passed. At this stage he came with an objection to the Service Book entry as unilateral and conjectural by reference to a certificate issued by a High School where, as claimed, he was a student of class VIII, showing a different date of birth.  With the factual background High Court Division took the view that this being a disputed question of fact and not a right secured or guaranteed by law is not determinable by the Labour Court under section 34 of the IRO.<br/> <br/>In the next case, ie, the case of Power Development Board, 1981 BLD (AD) 59, our Appellate Division held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“It is true that they, along with three other respondents were appointed before Nov,1964 were allowed the designation of Line-Helpers but there is no post like Line-Helpers in the revised pay scale effective from Nov, 1964 and as such mere entry in the service books or even their letters of appointments, of this designation  will not entitle them to the pay scale of lineman.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In this case the Appellate Division further held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The respondents themselves are not sure of their right to the designation and pay scale of lineman appears from their respective applications  under section 34 of the industrial relation ordinance in which they prayed for establishment of their right to designation and pay scale of Lineman and for  enforcement of their right therefor. Section 34 is not meant for establishment of any right, but it provides for enforcement of any existing right, guaranteed or secured by law, award or settlement.”  </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The observations of the Appellate Division came in the following factual background:<br/><br/>         Some workers (designated as Line-Helpers) of  the then Water and  Power Development Authority, Shortly, “WAPDA”, claimed the designation as well as pay scale of lineman under the revised pay scale.  As their claim was rejected they individually filed application in the Labor Court under sec 34 of the IRO for enforcement of their right to the designation and pay scale of ‘lineman’ and came out successful up to the High Court Division.<br/><br/>         Their pay scale was governed by the modified pay scales of WAPDA till Nov 24, 1964. Under the modified pay scale there were three categories of employees under the same designation of “Line-Helpers”. But their pay scale varied according as the variation of skill and experiences. From 24.11.1950 modified pay scale was replaced by revised pay scale under which post of Line-Helpers were abolished altogether and the incumbents tuned into either “Lineman” or “Helper”. Some of the respondents, appointed as Line Helpers, continued their designation as such even after introduction of the revised pay scale. And similarly those who were appointed after revised pay scale as Helpers were designated as “Line-Helpers” and these facts were entered in their service books although there was no post of Line-Helpers since 1964.<br/> <br/>None of the decisions referred to by Mr. Bulbul seems to be of any help to him for the precise reason that peculiar facts of individual cases did not suggest that the right sought to be enforced in those cases were secured or guaranteed by law. In both the cases facts alleged were by their nature, disputed and not established or secured by law admitting of enforcement under section 34 of the IRO. Two other cases reported in 29 DLR p 295 and 52 DLR p 274 on the face of them are far distinguishable and removed from the point raised thus are of no avail for the petitioner.<br/> <br/>The peculiarity of facts of this case is that the first party respondent came up and examined himself as PW.1. He proved, amongst others, his SSC certificate (Ext.1); Passport (Ext.2); Freedom Fighters’ Certificate (Ext. 3); his representation (Ext.5) to the authority-all in order to show that his date of birth is 15.6.1952 and accordingly his date of retirement would be due on 15.6.2012. But the petitioner did neither examine any witness nor produce any document to show otherwise. Rather an inquiry report of the Comilla Education Board submitted at the instance of the petitioner itself conformed the date of birth sought to be established by the first party respondent.<br/> <br/>The first party respondent stated on oath that he passed SSC Examination six years before he made application for the present job. And when he entered the job he was a student of B.Sc. He further stated that at the time of making application for the job he submitted the SSC certificate and a testimonial. He denied having mentioned anywhere 24 years as his age. He has rather indicated that he fell victim for his trade union activities. <br/> <br/>The impressive body of evidence available on records remains unassailed for no steps was taken by the petitioner to impeach the credit of the same or to prove anything to the contrary.  Curiously, office of the petitioner company gave employment to a young man studying at the material time in the undergraduate class but it chose not to bother for his certificates instead, felt it convenient to enter in his service book/ register a date of birth the basis of which they cannot prove.<br/> <br/>Mere entry of the date of birth in the service book/register irrespective of its proven infirmities and reasonable nexus to the actual date of birth borne out by irrefutable evidence cannot be treated as a cast-iron rule to be followed in all circumstances. In order to prevent manifest injustice from being perpetuated the entry may be corrected, provided that such correction stands the test of reasonableness in terms of chain reaction and other  incidents of it  in the service set up. <br/> <br/>Date of birth of a worker borne out by a document like the Secondary School Certificate remaining unassailed in terms of credibility, constitutes, in fit circumstances, right guaranteed or secured to him by or under the law, award or settlement as contemplated under section 34 of the Industrial Relations Ordinance, 1969 and is enforceable under the said section of law. <br/> <br/>From the above discussions we are of the view that a right guaranteed or secured by law, award or settlement as contemplated under section 34 of the IRO emerges in favour of the first party respondent which comes within the meaning of section 34 of the IRO and the case of the first party respondent under the said section is fairly maintainable.<br/> <br/>Now the related question of entitlement of the respondent to the enhanced age of retirement comes in. Public Corporation (Management Co-ordination) 0rdinance, 1986 provides the privilege for the workers serving in public corporation enhanced age of retirement, ie, 60 years instead of 57 years allowed in other laws.<br/> <br/>Sections 2(b), 2(e), 3 and 14A of the Public Corporation (Management Co-ordination) 0rdinance, 1986 would be relevant for ascertaining the question of entitlement of the respondent to enhanced age of retirement. The sections are quoted below.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong><em>Section 2(b):</em></strong><em> “enterprise” means an industrial or commercial enterprise, a company or a firm vested in, or owned by, or the majority shares in which belong to, the Government and which is placed under a public corporation by or under any law for the time being in force or an industrial or commercial enterprise, a company or a firm owned, managed or maintained by a public corporation;    </em><br/><br/><strong><em>Section 2(e):</em></strong><em> “worker” means any person, skilled or unskilled, who works for hire or rewards, but does not include a person who is employed in any managerial, administrative, supervisory or solely clerical capacity</em><br/><br/><strong><em>Section 3: </em></strong><em>The provisions of this Ordinance and the regulations made thereunder shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force.   </em><br/><br/><strong><em>Section 14A:</em></strong><em> (1) A worker of an enterprise shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the terms and conditions of his employment in any contract, rule, regulation, bye-law or other instrument, retire from employment on the completion of the sixtieth year of his age. </em><br/><em>Provided that a worker who has completed the sixtieth year of his age on or before the date of commencement of the Public Corporations (Management Co-ordination) (Amendment) Act, 1994 </em><em>shall cease to be in the employment of the enterprise on such commencement.]   </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The Public Corporation (Management Co-ordination) 0rdinance, 1986 is a special law intended to provide for co-ordination of management of the affairs and business of certain public corporations and for matters connected therewith. Section 3 of the Ordinance is an overriding clause excluding operation of all other law in its area of operation. The definition of ‘enterprise’ given in section 2(b) of the Ordinance covers the employer company. The application of the Ordinance to the company is not denied by the petitioner. What is said by the petitioner is that the Ordinance does not apply to the respondent as he is not a worker. The first party respondent is already found to be worker within the meaning of the Employment of Labour (Standing Order) Act, 1965 as well as the IRO.   Now it remains to be seen whether he is a ‘worker’ within the meaning of the Ordinance of 1986 so as to be entitled to the enhanced age of retirement.<br/> <br/>By a plain reading of section 2(e) of the Ordinance of 1986 quoted above we are left with no doubt that the first party respondent comes within its ambit as a worker.  Thus as a worker employed in the petitioner company the first party respondent is entitled to the enhanced age of 60 years  provided by section 14A of the Ordinance. <br/> <br/>The last point canvassed was about the question of finality of the date of birth declared by the respondent. Mr. Bubul in his bid to substantiate the point referred to rule 9 of the BSR and section 28(2) of the Srama Ain, 2006 and submitted that the date of birth declared by the respondent and accordingly entered in his service book is binding upon him. His application for correction or change of his date of birth is barred by law. We are not at all persuaded by his contention for the simple reason that here is a case where the respondent worker has denied having declared any such age or date and the petitioner has clearly failed to prove anything to the contrary. There is, therefore, no age and/or date of birth declared by the respondent worker so as to attract the rules of the BSR or the Srama Ain in this case. Furthermore, the Srama Ain, 2006 by its transitory provision contained in <u>section 353</u> has excluded the cases pending on the date of its coming into force from its operation. The instant case being one filed before the Srama Ain came into being is governed by the law as it stood at the material time.<br/> <br/>It follows, therefore, that no age or date of birth has ever been declared by the first party respondent as claimed by the petitioner. And he is a worker within the meaning of section 2(e) of the Public Corporation (Management Co-ordination) Ordinance, 1986 and accordingly entitled to get the privilege of extended time of retirement under section 18A of the said Ordinance.  His right to go on retirement on the basis of the date of birth mentioned in the Secondary School Certificate remains to be his right secured under law enforceable under section 34 of the IRO.   <br/> <br/>For all the reasons stated above we find no substance in the submissions of Mr. Zulfiqur Bulul so strenuously made before us. The rule by the same token, being devoid of merit, is liable to be discharged. <br/> <br/>In the result, this rule is discharged. The impugned judgment and order passed by the Labour Appellate Tribunal affirming those of the First Labour Court, Chittagong, are affirmed.  The first party respondent will be entitled to his cost throughout.<br/> <br/>Communicate a copy of this judgment at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Significantly the PWs. 2, 3, 6, 8 and 9 were examined on 14.12.2003, 24.09.2002, 24.04. 2003, 17.06.2003 and 18.12.2003 respectively. Other brother of deceased, Dulal (Pw. 10) was examined after 8/9 months later from the occurrence. Therefore, it is very unsafe to rely upon such witnesses in convicting the accused persons. . . .(65)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Evidence Act, (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 8</strong><br/><strong>The circumstances by themselves without anything more, are not enough to connect the condemned prisoner with the crime. It is, therefore, clear that the learned trial Court has committed a serious error of law in basing conviction of the condemned prisoner on such circumstantial evidence which has failed to connect the appellants with the crime. . . . (87)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure, (V of 1898)</strong><br/><strong>Section 342</strong><br/><strong>The prosecution tried to make a nexus between the accused Badu and the crime of murder by one pair of Sandal which was allegedly belonged to Badu but surprisingly we find that at the time of examination of accused Badu under Section 342 of the Code, attention to such incriminating evidence i.e. Sandal was not drawn to him. In our view the same seriously prejudiced the accused and he was denied to explain his position in respect of nexus between the last seen and recovery of the dead-body and also with the crime of murder. . . . (93)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Evidence Act, (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 30</strong><br/><strong>From appraisal of the evidence on record it is crystal clear that there is absolutely no evidence against the other six co-accused namely, Yunus, Zia, Mizan, Hanif, Anwar Hossain and Kader save and except their names were disclosed in the confession of accused Tota Mia. Since there is no substantive corroborative evidence against those accused, the said confession should not be used against them unless there exists independent evidence, direct or circumsta-ntial, to connect them with the murder. Since there is no direct evidence in this case against them, such confession should not be used against them. Exculpatory confession cannot be used against them. . . . (98, 106 and 110)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Evidence Act, (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 8</strong><br/><strong>The prosecution measurably failed to establish by evidence that soon after the occurrence, the accused had any responsibilities to discharge their duties towards the occurrence. It is well settled that mere abscondence cannot always be a circumstances leading to the inference of guilt of the accused. In this case, there is no evidence against the accused. Hence their subsequent abscondence cannot be treated as a circumstances leading to the inference of involvement in the crime. Mere abscondence cannot always be a circumstances which should lead to an inference of guilt of the accused. Sometimes out of fear and self respect and to avoid unnecessary harassment even an innocent person remain absconding for sometime. </strong><br/><br/><strong>In the instant case abscondence of six accused from beginning is not conclusive proof of their guilt, it cannot be the sole basis of their conviction as there is no other evidence against them. . . . (119 and 121)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Evidence Act, (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 3</strong><br/><strong>There cannot be conviction for murder on mere</strong><strong> suspicion or presumption. The commission of murder must be proved. The presumption cannot take the place of positive evidence.  </strong><br/><br/><strong>Legal evidence in a criminal trial is the evidence of the incriminating facts and circumstances of involvement of the accused in the commission of offence inevitable pointing to their guilty as the perpetrators incompatible with the plea of their innocence. In view of the proved facts and circumstances of the present case which do not constitute any legal evidence moral conviction should not be substituted in place of the legal evidence.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Law is now well settled that suspicion or doubt however strong it might be cannot take place of evidence or there be slightest doubt as to the involvement of the accused in the crime, he cannot be convicted.  . .

Ziaul Karim, J:</u></strong></span><br/> <br/>This reference under Section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (briefly as the Code) has been made by learned Sessions Judge, Narayangonj, for confirmation of death sentence of condemned-prisoner.<br/><br/>By the above appeals the appellants have challenged the legality and propriety of the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 30-07-2006 passed by learned Sessions Judge, Narayangonj, convicting the appellants under Sections 302,34 of the Penal Code and sentencing appellant Badiuzzaman alias Badu to death by hanging and also to pay a fine of Tk.50,000/= and sentencing the appellants namely 1. Yunus, 2. Zia alias Ziaul, 3. Mizan, 4. Hanif, 5.Anwar Hossain and 6. Kadir for imprisonment for life and also to pay a fine of Tk.50,000/- each in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one year more, however, acquitted the accused namely 1. Tota Mia, 2. Siraj alias Sirajul Islam, 3. Asduzzaman alias Ashu, 4. Abul  Kalam, 5. Samad and 6. Nur Hossain, 7.Nuruzzaman alias Zaman.<br/><br/>This death reference and all these appeals having arisen out of a common judgment, these have been heard together and are being disposed of by this judgment.<br/><br/>The prosecution case put in a nutshell are that victim Sohel (since deceased) younger son of Mursheda Begum (P.W.1) was staying at her village home at Kazirgaon. On 18-07-2002 at 7:00 p.m. accused Badiuzzaman alias Badu called him out with a pretext to enjoy picnic with Asaduzzaman alias Ashu, Siraj and Kader, scheduled to held at a trawler. On the way Md. Ruhul Amin (P.W. 2) local mosque Imam, Nayeb Ali and Tota Mia(P.W.3) found him with Badu.  On the same night he did not return. Later, his mother (P.W.1), brother (P.Ws. 8 and 10) unsuccessfully searched him in different places including their host and relatives. On 20-07-2002 at 8:00 p.m. Ripon (P.W. 8), brother of deceased found two pairs of sandal one belonged to deceased Sohel beside the Majerchar graveyard. On 21-07-2002 at 6:00 a.m. one body was found floating at the point of Anarkhal and Brahmmaputra river western side of the house of Jalil Mia of village Nayagaon. They identified him as the body of Sohel which bore multiple injuries. From the local sources it was learnt that Sohel went with accused 1.  Badiuzzaman alias Badu, 2. Siraj, 3. Kadir, 4. Yunus, 5. Ziaul, 6. Mizan, 7.Hanif and 8. Anwar to enjoy picnic at Chalk near Kazirgaon graveyard. Later, Sohel was murdered by those accused. It was suspected that due to previous rivalry such incident happened. With these allegation prosecution was launched by lodging a first information report (briefly as FIR) by Mursheda Begum (P.W.1) which was recorded as Sonargaon Police Station case no. 9 dated 21-07-2002 corresponding to G.R. no. 614 of 2002 accusing eight accused namely 1. Badiuzzaman alias Badu, 2. Md.  Kadir, 3. Siraj, 4. Yunus, 5. Zia alias Ziaul 6. Mizan, 7. Hanif, and 8. Anwar.<br/><br/>During investigation accused Tota Mia father of accused Badiuzzaman alias Badu made confession disclosing the above named accused along with others.<br/><br/>The Police after investigation submitted charge sheet under Sections 302, 34 of the Penal Code accusing fourteen accused including the FIR named accused numbering eight.<br/><br/>Eventually, the accused were called upon to answer the charge under Sections 302, 34 of the Penal Code and the accused on dock pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The absconding accused were defended by the State defence lawyer.<br/><br/>In course of trial the prosecution in all examined seventeen witnesses out of twenty charge sheeted witnesses.<br/><br/>The defence case as it appears from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses are that of innocence and false implication. It was divulged in defence that due to previous enmity they were falsely implicated in this case by their local rivals.<br/><br/>After trial the learned Sessions Judge convicted the accused as aforesaid holding that:</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;">The confession of co-accused Tota Mia was found voluntary and true who implicated the other co-accused;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">There are specific evidence that accused Badiuzzaman alias Badu called the victim out from home and all the accused murdered him;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Soon after the occurrence the accused fled away which is a circumstance led to an inference of guilt of the accused;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The victim Sohel (since deceased) was called away on 18-07-2002 and two pairs of sandals were found on 20-07-2002 in the morning, of which one sandal belonged to accused Badu which indicates the complicity of accused in the crime of murder;</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">The absconding accused after pronouncement of judgment being surrendered preferred the above appeals.<br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the State supports the reference and submits that accused Badu called deceased Sohel out and subsequently his dead-body was found which bore multiple injuries and prior to it two pairs of  Sandal one belonged to deceased and other Badu were also found beside the graveyard which were duly identified by witnesses. He adds that those are the incriminating circumstances against the accused. He adds that PWs. 1,2,3,5 and 8 found the victim Sohel with accused Badu for certain period of time but the accused failed to explain the subsequent death of Sohel which are also incriminating circumstances against them. The learned Counsel lastly submits that the Court below after considering the evidence on record rightly convicted the accused which calls for no interference by this Court.<br/><br/>The learned Counsels appearing for the condemned-prisoner and appellants by their common contention seek to impeach the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence on five fold arguments:<br/><br/><strong><u>Firstly:</u></strong> It was proved by evidence that there was a strained relations between the parties. So it was improbable to go Sohel with Badu to enjoy picnic along with other accused. The prosecution failed to prove the nexus between the last scene with Badu and later recovery of dead-body Sohel by evidence. Moreso, the attention to the incriminating materials particulars the sandal was not drawn to the accused Badu at the time of examination under Section 342 of the Code which seriously prejudiced him. In support of their contention they refer the case of Mizazul Islam alias Dablu Vs. The State 41 DLR(AD) 157 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“On the important items for linking up the accused with the crime namely the sandal was not at all put to the accused as a circumstance appearing in the case against him while he was examined u/s.342 Cr.P.C.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>They next refer the case of Ismail Sarker alias Sudan Member and others Versus State 33 DLR-320 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>Deceased was seen in the company of the accused at 10 p.m. followed by discovery of his dead-body at noon next day- No presumption, without further materials, that the accused was concerned in the murder of the deceased –Circumstantial evidence being not incompatible with accused innocence.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong><u>Secondly:</u></strong> The most important witnesses like PWs. 2,3,6,8,9 and 10 upon which the prosecution relied were examined by the investigating officers after long lapse of time, which are required to be left out of consideration. In support of their contention they refer the case of State Vs. Al Hasib Bin Jamal alias Hasib and five others 59 DLR- 653 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>Inordinate delay in examining the important prosecution witnesses casts a serious doubt as to the truth of the prosecution case and in the circumst-ances their evidence cannot be relied on and are to be left out of consideration.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong><u>Thirdly:</u></strong> The confession of an accused cannot be a basis of conviction of other co-accused without any corroborative evidence. In support of their contention they refer  the case of Fateh Sher and another Vs. Crown 1956  PLD(Lahore) 157 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>Confession affecting co-accused but affecting the maker: only impliedly–In admissible against co-accused.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Moreso, there are glaring inconsistencies and contradictions between the FIR and other evidences which are unsafe to convict the accused in such circumstances. In support of their contention they refer the case of Babor Ali Molla and others Vs. State 44 DLR(AD)10 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"<em>Vital omissions in FIR and statement to the Investigation Officer make their substantive evidence unreliable.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>Prosecution did not make attempt to examine relevant witnesses to corroborate PW 1’s claim that she mentioned name of accused Babor while lodging the FIR but the report was not read over to her. Nor is there any cross-examination of the Investigating Officer who stated to have read over the FIR to her who admitted the same to have been correctly recorded. Similarly, another eye-witness. PW. 5, did not state to the Investigating Officer about the recognition of some of the accused and injuries done to the deceased that were deposed in Court. Such vital omissions of material facts amount to contradiction. The High Court Division did not at all consider vital omissions relating to assault on the deceased. In view of such vital omissions it is difficult to rely upon the so-called eye witnesses.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>They further submit that the learned Judge convicted the non-confessing accused considering their abscondence, which    cannot be the sole basis of their conviction. In support of their contention they refer the case of State Vs. Al Hasib Bin Jamal alias Hasib and five others 59 DLR-653 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>It is well settled that abscondence of an accused is not conclusive proof to his guilt and cannot be the sole basis of his conviction without any corroborative evidence.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong><u>Fourthly:</u></strong> The learned Sessions Judge convicted the accused without complying the procedures prescribed in Sections 87, 88 of the Code. They add that the procedures which are required to be followed directly should be followed but by non-complying those proce-dures cause a serious prejudice to the accused. So the conviction and sentence cannot be sustained. In support of their contention they refer the case of Nazir Ahmad Vs. King Emperior AIR 1936(P.C.) 253 observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>To this contention it was answered that there was no ground for reading the word “ may “ in S. 164 as meaning “ must” on the principle described in 5 A C 214  (18). There is no need to call in aid this rule of construction-well recognized in principle but much debated as to its application. It can hardly be doubted that a magistrate would not be obliged to record any confession made to him, if, for example, it were that of a self-accusing madman or for any other reason the Magistrate thought it to be  incredible or useless for the purposes of justice Whether a Magistrate records any confession is a matter of duty and discretions and not of obligation. The rule which applies is a different and not less well recognised rule, namely, that where a power is given to do a certain thing in a certain way the thing must be done in that way or not at all. Other methods of performance are necessarily forbidden. This doctrine has often been applied to Courts 1Ch D 426(19) at P. 431- and although the Magistrate acting under this group of sections is not acting as a Court, yet he is a judicial officer and both as a matter of construction and of good sense there are strong reasons for applying the rule in question to S. 164”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In support of last seen they refer the case of Rezaul Haq and others Vs. State 42 DLR-440 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>If it is proved beyond doubt that the deceased is seen last alive in the company of the accused, he is a liable to offer satisfactory explanation as to the cause of death of the deceased or at least as to his company with the deceased. If circumst-antial evidence leading to the irresistible conclusion that the accused alone caused the death of the victim is not considered sufficient for his conviction then there can never be any conviction on circumstantial evidence. In other words, the prosecution cannot prove its case by circumstantial evidence. Such a concept contrary to time, honoured principle of law regarding circumstantial evidence.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong><u>Fifthly:  </u></strong>The prosecution failed to prove time, place and manner of occurrence. They add that some unknown assailants may have committed the murder of Sohel for the cause of taking leadership to the locality but due to local rivalry those accused were implicated. They lastly submit that the prosecution measurably failed to prove the charge against the appellants beyond all reasonable doubt and conviction and sentence based on misreading and non-consideration of the evidence on record which cannot be sustained in the eye of law.<br/> <br/>In order to appreciate their submissions we have gone through the record and given our anxious consideration to their submissions.<br/><br/>Let us now weigh and sift the evidence on record as adduced by the prosecution to prove the charge.<br/><br/>P.W.1, Mursheda Begum is the informant and mother of deceased Sohel. She deposed that on 18-07-2002 at 7:00 p.m. accused Badiuzzaman alias Badu called her son Sohel out from their home with a plea to go for picnic with Ashu, Siraj and Kader in presence of Tota Mia.

Deceased Sohel did not return in the same night. So his mother unsuccessfully searched him in different places. On Saturday Ripon found two pairs of sandal and one Chinese axe near the graveyard and identified the sandal of Sohel and Badu and a China axe, used by accused Kadir. He was examined by the I.O. after 8/9 months of the occurrence.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that he heard the occurrence. The picnic was held in the Trawler. He denied the suggestion that he was deposing falsely due to local rivalry.<br/><br/>P.W. 10 Dulal younger brother of deceased Sohel.

At 10: 30 a.m. he held autopsy upon the cadaver  of Sohel aged about twenty years and found the following injuries:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“1. Extensive transversed ecchymosis on the right lateral aspect, anterior aspect on the left lateral aspect of mid middle of the neck.’</em><br/><em>2. Multiple ecchymosis on the left side of the face, on forehead, on the anterior  aspect of the upper part of the both side of the chest, on the back on the left parietal region, on the occipital region, on the both forearms.</em><br/><em>On dissection: Tissues were  congested and extra vasated with clotted bloods which resisted in washing. Tracking was found congested with blood clots.</em><br/><em>Lungs congested with emphysematous hullae Death was caused due to asphyxia resulting from strangulation from above mentioned injuries which were ante mortem and homicidal in nature.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>He proved the Post mortem report as Exhbt. 4 and his signature on it as Exhbt. 4/1.<br/>In cross-examination he stated that he did not mention the age of injuries and denied the suggestion that he submitted a perfunctory report.<br/><br/>P.W.12 Manjarul Mannan, Magistrate first class. He deposed that on 24-04-2003 he recorded the confession of accused Tota Mia after complying the provision of law. He proved the confession as Exhbt. 5 and his signature on it as Exhbt. 5/1.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that accused Tota did not implicate himself in his confession.<br/><br/>P.W. 13 Saiful Islam, Inspector CID. He deposed that on 21-07-2002 he recorded the FIR and filled up its form. He proved the same as Exhbt. 6 and his signature on it as Exhbt. 6/1.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he denied the suggestion that the FIR was not written at the instance of informant.<br/><br/>P.W.14, C- Amzad Hossain. He deposed that on 21-07-2002 he carried the dead-body to the morgue. He proved the Challan of it as Exhbts. 7, 7/1 and 7/2.<br/><br/>P.W. 15 Md. Aminul Islam, A.S.P. He deposed that on 17-03-3002 he was attached in Dhaka Zone. He investigated the case, visited the place of occurrence, recorded the statement of the witnesses under Section 161 of the Code, and made arrangement for recording confession of co-accused Tota Mia. After investigation he submitted the charge sheet.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that he took over the investigation on 17-03-2003. He examined witnesses Ripon on 17-06-2003, Taulad on 08-12-2003, Fatema on 24-04-2003.<br/><br/>He denied the suggestion that after perfunctory investigation he submitted charge sheet.<br/><br/>P.W. 16 S.I. Giasuddin, Partly investigated the case. He deposed that on 14-12-2002 he took over the investigation and examined witness Ruhul Amin. After transfer he handed over the case to the Officer-in-Charge.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that after five months of the occurrence Ruhul Amin was examined.<br/><br/>P.W. 17 S.I. Sultan Ahmed, partly investigated the case. He deposed that on 18-07-2002 he was attached with Sonargaon Police Station. S.I. Saiful recorded the case. He proved the same as Exhbt.1. He visited the place of occurrence, held inquest (Exhbts. 8, 8/1) prepared sketch map and index (Exhbts. 9 and 10). After transfer he handed over the case to next I.O.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that he visited the place of occurrence but did not seize alamats of seizure list. He did not find any witness regarding picnic held on Trawler and no material of picnic was found inside the Trawler, accused Badu was taken in Police remand for a period two times. He denied the suggestion that he did not investigate the case properly.<br/><br/>These are all of the evidence on record adduced by the prosecution to prove the charge.<br/><br/>It is indisputable that slain Sohel was lynched.<br/><br/>On going to the materials on record it transpires that the prosecution in all examined seventeen witnesses out of twenty charge sheeted witnesses, of whom P.W.1 mother of the deceased and informant of the case. P.Ws. 2,3,4,5,6 and 7 are the local witnesses. They heard the occurrence. P.Ws. 8, 9, 10 are the relations of deceased, PW-11 held autopsy upon the cadaver carried by P.W. 14, P.W.12 Magistrate, first Class recorded the confession of accused Tota Mia. P.Ws. 13,15,16 and 17 are the official witnesses, of whom P.W.15 submitted charge sheet accusing the accused.<br/><br/>We should bear in mind, credibility of testimony oral and circumstantial, depends considerably on a judicial evaluation of the totality, not isolated scrutiny. When dealing with the serious question of guilt or innocence of persons charged with crime, the following principles should be taken into consideration.</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;">The onus of proving everything essential to the establishment of the charge against the accused lies on the prosecutor.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The evidence must be such asto exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In matters of doubt it is safer to acquit than to condemn, for it is better that several guilty persons should escape than that one innocent person suffer.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">There must be clear and unequivocal proof of the corpus delicit.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The hypothesis of delinquency should be consistent with all the facts proved.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Inspite of the presumption of truth attached to oral evidence under oath if the Court is not satisfied, the evidence inspite of oath is of no avail.<br/><br/>It is true that there is no eye witness to the crime of murder.  The prosecution case absolu-tely rests upon the evidence of P.Ws.1,2,3,6,8 and 9 and also circumstantial evidence. P.W. 1 stated that on 18-07-2002 at 7:00 p.m. accused Badu came to her village home and asked Sohel to go with him to enjoy picnic with accused Ashu, Siraj and Kadir. Then victim Sohel went out with accused Badu. The victim Sohel was lastly seen with accused Badu on 18-07-2002 at 7:00 p.m. and the above witnesses were examined to corroborate such incident. P.W.2, Imam of local mosque and P.W. 3 uncle of deceased, P.Ws. 8, 9 and 10 are the brothers. They also found the deceased with accused Badu for a certain period of time on 18-07-2002 at 7:00 p.m. Since then the prosecution failed to produce any witness in support to enjoy picnic held at Trawler and such facts was also corroborated by P.W.17. We find that dead-body of deceased Sohel was recovered after three days from taking away him from home and the incriminating sandal was recovered two days later from calling him on 18-07-2002. It should be noticed that those witnesses were examined by the investigating officer after long lapse of time. Significantly P.Ws. 2,3,6,8 and 9 were examined on 14-12-2003, 24-09-2002, 24-04-2003, 17-06-2003, 18-12-2003 respectively. Other brother of deceased, Dulal (PW-10) was examined after 8/9 months later from the occurrence. Therefore, it is very unsafe to rely upon such witnesses in convicting the accused.<br/><br/>In the case of Bangladesh (State) Vs. Paran Chandra Baroi 1986 BCR(AD)225  held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>The long delay in examining the material witnesses cast a doubt on the whole prosecution case.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of Vijaybhai Bhanabhai Patel Vs.

State 45 DLR-489 it was held inordinate delay in examining the important prosecution witnesses casts a serious doubt as to the truth of the prosecution case and in the circumstances their evidence cannot be relied on and are to be left of consideration. In the case of Bangladesh Vs. Paran Chandra Baroi, 1986 BCR(AD) 225 it was held that the long delay in examining the material witnesses casts a doubt on the whole prosecution case. In the case of Muslimuddin and others Vs. State, 38 DLR (AD)311 evidence of P.W. 3 who claimed to have recognised the assailants was not relied upon as her statement, which could have been recorded on the day following the incident, was recorded after 34 days.

In view of the above settled principle of law the evidence of P.Ws. 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 10 should not be relied upon and the same are to be left out of consideration.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The circumstances upon which the prosecution relied was that the accused Badu called out the victim on 18-07-2002 at the evening. Since then the prosecution failed to make a nexus upto the recovery dead-body of the deceased Sohel and complicity of others accused.<br/><br/>The circumstantial evidence in order to sustain conviction, must be complete chain and in capable of explanation of any other hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused. It must be qualitatively such that on every reasonable hypothesis, the conclusion must be that the accused is guilty not on fantastic possibilities not fresh interference, but rational deduction which reasonable minds make from the probative force of facts if circumstances (AIR 1984 SC 1622, 1994 BLD 33). Where all the evidence is circumstantial it is necessary that cumulative its effect should be to exclude any reasonable hypothesis of the innocence of the accused (1985 BLD (AD) 301). The circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established and the circumstances should be of conclusive nature and tendency. There must be chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that all human probability the act must have been done by the accused and the accused alone ( AIR 1990 SC 214).<br/><br/>Court has to conclusively decide the guilt or otherwise of the accused in clear terms but cannot leave the accused to be punished by Allah. This is peculiar and unknown method which the Apex Court strongly disproved and upon reassessment of the evidence on record convicted accused–respdt. since acquitted by High Court Division (10 MLR(AD)175).<br/><br/>Death sentence can be awarded on circumstantial evidence provided all circumsta-nces constituted a chain and no link is missing and their combined effect in that the guilt of the accused is established beyond any shadow of doubt (PLD 2003 SC 704). The onus is on the prosecution to prove that the chain is complete (AIR 1984 SC 1622). Where various links in a chain are in themselves complete then a false plea or a false defence may be called into aid only to lend assurance to the Court. In other words, before using the additional link it must be proved that all the links in the chain are complete and do not suffer from any infirmity (41 DLR 11).<br/><br/>Where circumstances even if proved, there is a missing link and those circumstances can not lead to any irresistible conclusion that there was no other hypothesis except the guilt of the accused (61 DLR 310).<br/><br/>In a case based on circumstantial evidence the prosecution is under an obligation to establish fully and cogently each of the circumstances, which they want to rely upon [1992(2) Crimes 858]. The proved circumsta-nces should be of conclusive nature and definite tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused. It is not necessary that each circumstances by itself be conclusive but cumulatively must form unbroken chain of events leading to the proof of the guilt of the accused and no link in the chain should be missing (PLJ 1999 SC 729). If the circum-stances or some of them can be explained by any of the reasonable hypothesis then the accused must have the benefit of that hypot-hesis. In assessing evidence ordinary human probabilities but not the imaginary possibilities to be considered. When there is no direct witness to the commission of murder and the case rest entirety on circumstantial evidence, the circumstances relied on must be fully established. It is necessary to distinguish between primary or basic fact and inference of fact to be drawn from them. The Court has to consider the evidence and decide whether the evidence proves a particular fact or not whether the fact leads to the inference of the guilt of the accused or not is another aspect and in dealing with that aspect of the problem, the doctrine of benefit would reply and an inference of guilt can be drawn only if the proved fact are inconsistent with the innocence of the accused and are consistent only with his guilt( 1990 SC 214).<br/><br/>The law in respect of circumstantial evid-ence is well settled, circumstantial evidence can only be acted upon if each and every circumstance is individually and conclusively proved and the circumstances so proved must collectively lead to the only conclusion that the accused persons are not guilty of the crime. The proved circumstances must form a chain so complete by itself that they should  result in the only conclusion of being consistent with the guilt of the accused (1989(2) Crimes 240 Delhi, 37 DLR (AD) 87). If there be any missing link the accused will escape through it, for in that case the prosecution case will not be proved upto the hilt (9 BLT(AD) 107).<br/><br/>The rule as regards sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to be the basis for conviction is that the facts proved must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused and in capable of explanation by any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt(43 DLR 512).<br/><br/>The rule of circumstantial evidence is that each of circumstances must be knitted together closely so as to lead to an irresistible concl-usion that the accused alone had committed the offence by excluding the possibility that any other person might have committed the offence. The chain of events must be such that the possibility of innocence of the accused is wholly excluded and such facts are incapable of explanation of any reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the accused. If the circumstances do not provide any conclusive of the guilt of the accused, he cannot be convicted merely on the ground that such circumstances provide a strong ground for suspicion against the accused. If the theory of guilt and innocence are equally probable, then also the theory that favour of accused must be accepted (1991 BLD 158).<br/><br/>Relying on a number of decisions of the Supreme Court of the Sub-continent certain principles which are required to be followed in the criminal cases based on circumstantial evidence have been laid down in the case of Hasan Ali and another Vs. The State reported in 38 DLR(1986) 235 and those are reproduced below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>        “1. The circumstances for which an inference adverse to the accused was sought to be drawn must be proved beyond reasonable doubt;<br/>        2. That circumstances, if proved, must be incompatible with their innocence of the accused and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis that of this guilt. In other words, the inculpable facts must be such that the probability of innocence of the accused is wholly excluded ;<br/>        3. If the circumstantial evidence does not furnish conclusive proof of the guilt of the accused he cannot be convicted merely for the reason that the circumstantial evidence provides a ground for strong suspicion against him;<br/>        4. If the theory of guilt and the theory of innocence are equally probable, then also the accused cannot be convicted on such evidence.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Hasan Ali and another reported in 38 DLR 235 accused appellants were alleged to have gone to the house of the victim, called and brought him out and took him with them in the evening of 22-12-81 and the dead-body was found in the afternoon on the next day. In the said case it was held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>Merely  because the two accuseds had called and taken away the victim the previous evening it will be most unre-asonable to think that none but the two accused had called and taken away the victim. At least such a conclusion is not only beyond the scope but also absolutely unsafe to stretch the imagination so far.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Abdul Aziz and others Vs. The State reported in 33 DLR 402 it has been held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>The evidence that the accused forcibly took away the deceased at night followed by the discovery of his dead-body next morning were not enough for conviction under sections 302,324 of the Penal Code.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the present case there is no direct evidence of the commission of murder. Nobody saw the accused persons causing any assault on him and the whole case rests on the evidence of the P.Ws. 1,2,3,4,6,8,9 and 10 but none of them has seen the occurrence.  The law on the point is now well settled. To put it in the words of Munir CJ expressed himself in the case reported in PLD 1950 Lahore 288(FB) in the following language :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>To find a man guilty of a criminal offence on circumstantial evidence the facts proved must be consistent with the theory of guilt and incompatible with theory of innocence.” It is further obser-ved in the case “no man is to be found guilty on circumstantial evidence unless the circumstances established against him are such that no reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt can be built upon them”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Eradu and others Vs. State of Hyderabad reported in PLD 1956 (SC) India Page 286 it is held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>It is fundamental principle of Crimi-nal Jurisprudence that circumstantial evidence should point inevitably to the conclusion that the accused and the accused only were the perpetrators of the offence and as such evidence should be incompatible with the innocence of the accused.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The instant case is pre-eminently case where there is total absence of physical circumstances and link to connect the accused appellants with the crime and in that situation ocular evidence, to carry conviction, has also not come from unimpeachable source and it is also not supported by any strong circumstances, so as to over come the inherent doubt by which such evidence is necessarily affected.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The mode of approach of the evidence adopted by the learned trial Court is unsuitable for formation of a correct conclusion in a case of this nature. The Court below found that the accused were responsible for the crime without considering that the prosecution has failed to built up a link by circumstances so as to connect the appellant with the commission of the crime. There being no direct evidence in case and the circumstantial evidence being not conclusive, we cannot agree with the conclusion reached by the court below.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In our opinion, the circumstances by themselves without anything more, are not enough to connect the condemned prisoner with the crime. It is, therefore, clear that the learned trial Court has committed a serious error of law in basing conviction of the condemned prisoner on such circumstantial evidence which has failed to connect the appellants with the crime.<br/> <br/>In the case of Tasliumuddin alias Tasir and three others Vs. State 44 DLR 136 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>The fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence is that circumstantial evidence should inevitable be to the conclusion that the accused and the accused only were the perpetrators of the offence and such evidence should be incompatible with the innocence of the accused”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Rahman Vs. The St ate of U.P.

Khasru alias Syed Mostafa Hossain and another 43 DLR(AD)182 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>Circumstantial evidences-Its conclus-iveness- assessment of evidence- This is a case in which a minor boy, the victim of murder, was called away by and seen in the company of the two young accused for the last time before disappearance and then sometime thereafter the body of the victim was found out. The fact of calling away of victim Khairul by accused Khasru was satisfactorily established as the first circumstance in support of the prosecution and witnesses have also satisfactory proved that the victim traveled with the two accused from their village Noapara to a distant place called Takerhat by bus and got down there at 4-00/4.30 PM. On 04-01-1979. This is the second circumstance proved against the accused. From this point onward upto the time of recovery of the body Khairul at about 3.00/3.30 p.m. on the following day the accused were alleged to have been along with the deceased, the third  circumstance in the absence of ocular evidence of murder, by PWs. 11 &amp; 12. The High Court Division rejected their evidence due to apparent contradiction between their evidence and the statement made by them before the police and also for the reason that their identification of the accused in the TI parade had lost all significance in view of the fact that they had chance to see the accused. There has been no violation of any norm or procedure in assessing the evidence of the said two witnesses for which the finding of fact made by the High Court Division could be disturbed. The position therefore comes to this that the third circumstance, that of, seeing the three boys together near the bank of the river where the victim’s body was found was not satisfactory established. The circumsta-nces of the case can never be said to be conclusive as to the guilt of accused Khasru and his brother Nowab. The High Court Division has correctly applied the rule as to circumstantial evidence in the facts of the present case.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>These view receive support in the case of Abdus Samad Vs. The State 16 DLR(SC) 261, Anisur Rahman and others Vs. The State 1986 BLD(AD)77, 1987 BCR(AD)187, Taslimuddin alias Tasir Vs. The State 44 DLR 136 and the cases reported in 11 DLR(SC) 365, PLD 1956 SC 286, 33 DLR 402. Nuru and another Vs. The State 1 BLC-582 (Para-14).<br/> <br/>In the case of the State Vs. Khasru alias Syed  Mostafa Hossain and another 43 DLR(AD) 183 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Murder charge resting on circumst-antial evidence-Accused’s motive in calling out and accompanying the victim boy- There is absolutely no material on record to show that anybody had at any stage expressed any suspicion that the accused might have had any evil motive in calling out he victim. All that the father said at the trial was that the motive for murder was to give him pain. This is no motive. He did not say why the young accused would cause him pain. There is also no material to suggest even that there might have been some immediate and on-the–spot reason for the accused to cause violence to the victim or that they were acting at some others’ behest.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>On appraisal of the evidence on record we find that deceased Sohel was called away by accused Badu and both were lastly seen at the evening i.e. on 18-07-2002 at 7:00 p.m. The prosecution tried to make a nexus between the accused Badu and the crime of murder by one pair of Sandal which was allegedly belonged to Badu but surprisingly we find that at the time of examination of accused Badu under Section 342 of the Code, attention to such incriminating evidence i.e. Sandal was not drawn to him. In our view the same seriously prejudiced the accused and he was denied to explain his position in respect of nexus between the last seen and recovery of the dead-body and also with the crime of murder.<br/> <br/>The learned Judge of the Court below relied on the testimony of PW-8 Md. Repon Mia that two pairs of sandal one belonged to accused Badu were recovered.  “Therefore, the recovery of sandal links appellant Badu with the crime”. The learned Sessions Judge, however, omitted to mention the implication of the sandal. It is unfortunate that one of the important items for linking up the accused with the crime, namely, the sandal was not at all put to the accused as a circumstance appearing in the case against him. In the similar case in Sarwan Singh Rattan Singh  Vs. State of Punjab reported in A.I.R. 1957 (SC) 637, the Indian Supreme Court considered the implication of such omission. It was observed “Unfortunately, in his examination under Section 342 of the Code, no question had been put to Sarwan Singh about those shoes. It is not unlikely that Sarwan Singh may have offered to demonstrate that the shoes did not fit in with his feet.” In any event, failure to give him an opportunity to explain the circumstances in h is examination under section 342 of the Code justifies the defence argument that this circumstance should not be used against him.<br/> <br/>In the case of Mizazul Islam alias Dablu Vs. The State 41 DLR(AD) 157 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>One of the important items for linking up the accused with the crime namely the sandal was not at all put to the accused as a circumstance appearing in the case against him while he was examined u/s. 342 Cr.P.C.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Therefore, we hold that the prosecution failed to prove the charge against the condemned prisoner beyond all reasonable doubt.<br/> <br/>We find that the learned Judge convicted the other six co-accused namely–Yunus, Zia, Mizan, Hanif, Anwar Hossain and Kader relying on the confession made by accused Tota Mia (since acquitted). For the convenience of understanding the material excerpt of the said confession reads as hereunder:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong><u>তো</u></strong><strong><u>তা  মিয়াঃ</u></strong> আমার নাম তোতা মিয়া, পিতা মৃত চান মিয়া, গ্রাম-কাজীরগাওঁ, থানা সোনারগাওঁ, আমি ঘটনার দিন আদমজী মি­ল ই.ই. ডিউটি­ত ছিলাম। রা­ত ডিউটি  ক­রতে লাঙ্গলবন্দ যাই। আমার ভাতিজা আনার এর দোকান  গে­ল আনার আমা­ক জানায় যে, আমার ছে­ল বদু মৃত সো­হল­ক গতকাল সন্ধ্যা সময় বাড়ী হ­ত ডে­ক আনে। ঐ সময় ব্রম্মপুত্র নদীর পা­ড়  চ­ক আসামী আশু, সিরাজ, ছা­মদ, কাদির, আনার, হানিফা, জিয়া, মিজান, ইউনুছ  পিকনিক  খাই­তছিল। সো­হল­ক ডে­ক আনার প­র আসামীরা ট্রলা­র ক­র নি­য় যায়। প­র শুনি সো­হল­ক আসামীরা মে­র  ফে­ল। বৃহস্পতিবার রা­ত সো­হল­ক  মে­র ফে­ল।  রবিবা­র  সো­হ­লর  লাশ গা­ঙর  মা­ঝ পায়। আমার ছে­ল বদু বাড়ী­ত   চ­ল আ­সে।  আমার ছে­লের বন্ধু ছিল সো­হল। সো­হল­ক দি­য় আসামীরা ডে­ক নেয়।  আমি প­র বাড়ী­ত  না গি­য়  আমার মে­য়র বাড়ী­ত যাই। আমার মে­য়ও  আমা­ক  একই ঘটনা  জানায়। গত বর্ষায় সো­হেল­কে মে­র ফে­লে।   আসামী­দর সা­থে আসামী­দর শত্রুতা  থাক­ত পা­রে। এই আমার জবানবন্দি।</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">                                    স্বাক্ষর/- তোতা মিয়া</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 120px;">Signature or mark of the accused.”|</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From appraisal of the evidence on record we find that there is absolutely no evidence against those six co-accused save and except their names were disclosed in the confession of accused Tota Mia. We also find that there is no substantive corroborative evidence against those accused. So the said confession should not be used against them.<br/><br/>It is well settled that the confession of an accused is not a substantive piece of evidence against co-accused who did not confess and such evidence alone without any substantive corroborative evidence cannot form basis of conviction of co-accused. With this regard reliance is being placed in this case of Mofazzal Hossain alias Mofa and others Vs. State 58 DLR-524. This view receives support in the cases of State Vs. Rafiqullah Khan 7 BLC-480, Ustar Ali Vs. State 3 BLC (AD)53, Lutfurnahar Vs. State 27 DLR(AD)29, Babor Ali Molla Vs. State 44 DLR(AD)10, State Vs. Lalu Mia 39 DLR(AD)117, Amir Hossain Vs. State 37 DLR(AD)179, Joygun Bibi Vs. The State 12 DLR(SC) 156.<br/><br/>Therefore we hold that the learned Judge without considering the settled principle of law and the materials and evidence on record most erroneously convicted them which cannot be sustained.<br/><br/>The explanation given under the section includes within the term “offence” used in the section, the abetment or attempt to commit the offence. The language of the section does not render the confession of a co-accused as evidence within the definition of section 3 of the Evidence Act. It simply says that the Court may “take into consideration such confession”. In the case of Bhuboni Sahu Vs. The King, reported in L.R.76 Indian Appeals page 147, the Privy Council stated as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“But a confession of a co-accused is obviously evidence of a very weak type. It does not indeed come within the definition of “evidence” contained in section 3 of the Evidence Act. It is not required to be given on oath, nor in the presence of the accused, and it cannot be tested by cross-examination. Section 30, however, provi-des that the court may take the confession into consideration and thereby, no doubt, makes it evidence on which the court may act; but the section does not say that the confession is to amount to proof. Clearly there must be other evidence. The confession is only one element in the consideration of all the facts proved in the case; it can be put into the scale and weighed with the other evidence.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In view of the observation above, the questions arose in what way can a confession be used in support of other evidence and whether it can be used to fill in missing gaps. The questions were considered by the Supreme Court of India in the case of Kashmira Singh Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, reported in 1952 S.C.R.(India) 526. After referring approvingly to the observations made by Sir Lawrence Jenkins in the case of Emperor Vs. Lalit Mohan Chockerbutty, reported in (1911) I.L.R.38 Calcutta, 559 at 588 where it was said that such a confession can only be used to “ led assurance to other evidence against a co-accused” and to the observation of Reilly, J. in re Periyaswami Moopan reported in (1931) I.L.R. 54 Madras, 75 at 77 that “where there is evidence against the co-accused sufficient, if believed, to support his conviction, then the kind of confession described in section 30 may be thrown into the scale as an additional reason for believing that  evidence”, the Supreme Court of India held as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The proper way to approach a case of this kind is first, to marshal the evidence against the accused excluding the confession altogether from consideration and see whether, if it is believed a conviction could safely be based on it. If it is capable of belief independently of the confession, then of course it is not necessary to call the confession in aid. But cases may arise when the judge is not prepared to act on the other evidence as it stands even though, if believed, it would be sufficient to sustain a conviction. In such an event the Judge may call in aid the confession and use it to lend assurance to the other evidence and thus fortify himself in believing what without the aid of the confession he would not be prepared to accept.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>We may as well refer to the views expressed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan is two cases. In the case of Joygun Bibi Vs. The State, reported in (1960) 12 DLR(SC)156 it was held that the High Court was not justified in discarding the confession of co-accused Abdul Majid, in connection with the question of the guilt of the appellant Joygun Bibi. It was found that confession of Abdul Majid was by no means the only material against Joygun Bibi but that there was other evidence which, along with the confession of Abdul Majid, pointed to her guilt.<br/><br/>In the case of Maqbool Hussain Vs. The State, reported in (1960) 12 DLR (SC) 217 the Supreme Court of Pakistan made the following observations regarding the use of a confession under Section 30 of the Evidence Act-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The language of the section is very guarded and lends no warrant to the inference that such a statement made by a co-accused could be treated as substa-ntive evidence against the other person sufficient to sustain his conviction. It is well settled that there ought to be other evidence, whether direct or circumsta-ntial, linking such a person with the crime. Before a confession made by a co-accused could be adverted to, in adjud-ging the guilt of that person.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The upshot of the discussions above is that confession of an accused cannot be treated as substantive evidence against another accused but that it can only be used “ to lend assurance to other evidence.”<br/>In the instant case, there is no doubt that the above six appellants have been implicated in the murder in the confessional statement of co-accused, but the said confessional statement cannot be taken into consideration unless there exists independent evidence, direct or circumst-antial, to connect the appellants with the murder. There is no direct evidence in this case against them. So such confession should not be used against them.<br/><br/>In Indian Jurisdiction we find that while dealing with a case as regards the confession of co-accused affecting himself and some other persons who were being tried jointly with him for the same offence, their Lordships of the Supreme Court of India have laid down the law as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“In dealing with a criminal case where the prosecution relies upon the confession of one accused person against another accused person, the proper approach to adopt is to consider the other evidence against such an accused person, and if the said evidence appears to be satisfactory and the Court is inclined to hold that the said evidence may sustain the charge framed against the said accused person, the Court turns to the confession with a view to assure itself that the conclusion which it is inclined to draw from the other evidence is right,   AIR 1964 SC 1184.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In a case it has been observed as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“In dealing with a case against an accused person, the Court can not start with the confession of a co-accused person; it must begin with other evidence adduced by the prosecution and after it has formed its opinion with regard to the quality and effect of the said evidence, then  it is permissible to turn to the confession in order to receive assurance to the conclusion of guilt which the judicial mind is about to reach on the said other evidence. That, briefly stated, is the effect of the provisions contained in section 30, AIR 1949 PC 257+ AIR 1952 SC 159.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Under section 30, Evidence Act, confes-sion of a co-accused can only be taken into consideration but is not in itself substantive evidence. AIR 1957 SC 381+AIR 1964 AP 548.<br/><br/>Where such statement is exculpatory it cannot be used against another accused in support of his conviction. It would be dangerous to do so. AIR 1967. Goa 31 at p.25.<br/><br/>It has been laid down that confessions of co-accused are not evidence as defined in section 3 and no conviction can be founded thereon. But, if there was other evidence on which a conviction be based, they can be referred to as lending assurance to that conclusion and for fortifying it. AIR 1956 SC 56.<br/><br/>The law is well-settled that the confession of a co-accused is not substantive evidence in the sense that conviction on that alone must stand and section 30 has merely given the Court a discretion to call it in aid inappropriate case. It can be used only for lending assurance and is to be merely an  element in considering the evidence in the case. If there is no other evidence or if the other evidence in the case is insufficient to establish the case against the accused, the confession cannot betaken into consideration against the co-accused. It cannot be called in aid to supplement evidence otherwise insufficient and in no case can  it be used to fill up gaps in the prosecution evidence. AIR 1957 A.P. 758 + AIR 1952 SC 139 + AIR 1956 SC 56+AIR 1957 Orissa 172.<br/><br/>The confession of a co-accused person can be pressed into service only when the Court is inclined to accept other evidence and feels the necessity of seeking for an assurance in support of its conclusion deducible from the said evidence. AIR 1952 SC 159+AIR 1964 SC 1184+AIR1965 Orissa 170.<br/><br/>A confession can only be used to “lend assurance to other evidence against a co-accused AIR 1966 Pat. 448.<br/><br/>Their Lordships held that one of the conditions in section 30 of the Evidence Act is that the confession must implicate the maker substantially to the same extent as the other accused against whom it is sought to be taken into consideration. Where he was really trying to throw the main blame on the other accused and make out that he was an unwilling spectator to the crime committed by the other accused, the confession cannot be used at all against the other accused. But because there was differences between his confession and the confessional statement of the other accused, the confessional statement cannot be condemned in limini. AIR 1957 SC 216+(1966) 142 Cut LT 1140.<br/><br/>The confessional statement made by one accused could only be taken into consideration against other co-accused if there is other acceptable evidence against the other co-accused for the purpose of lending further assurance which the Court may need. Hence in the absence of any other evidence in this case the confessional statement made by any one of the co-accused cannot be used against the other appellants AIR 1964 SC 1184+1977 Crl.LJ 1309।<br/><br/>The confessions of co-accused are not evidence but if there is other evidence on which a conviction can be based, they can be referred to as lending some assurance to the verdict. AIR 1956 SC 56+AIR 1968 SC 832.<br/><br/>The learned Judge also convicted the aforesaid six accused considering their absconsion, the prosecution also tried to make nexus between the absconsion and the crime of murder.<br/><br/>According to the submissions from prosecution and observations made by the learned Judge, it indicate that those accused remained absconding from the place of occurrence for certain period, which is a circumstances leading to the inference of guilt. In our view it is mere submissions and observations of the Court below. The prosecution measurably failed to establish by evidence that soon after the occurrence, the accused had any responsibilities to discharge their duties towards the occurrence. It is well settled that mere abscondence cannot always be a circumstances leading to the inference of guilt of the accused. In this case, there is no evidence against the accused. Hence their subsequent abscondence cannot be treated as a circumstances leading to the inference of involvement in the crime. Mere abscondence cannot always be a circumstances which should lead to an inference of guilt of the accused. Sometimes out of fear and self respect and to avoid unnecessary harassment even an inno-cent person remain absconding for sometime.<br/><br/>It is well settled that abscondence of an accused is not conclusive proof of his guilt and cannot be the sole basis of his conviction without any corroborative evidence. In the case of Ashraf Ali Munshi vs. State, 48 DLR 590, it is held that the accused absconded soon after the crime is not conclusive evidence of guilt. It may lend weight to other evidence. Same view was taken in the cases of Shahjahan vs. State, 46 DLR 575, State vs. Balai Chandra Sarker, 47 DLR 467, State vs. Sree Ranjit Kumar Pramanik, 45 DLR 660, Abdul Khaleque vs. State 45 DLR 75, Sanwar Hossain vs. State, 45 DLR 489, Abdus Salam vs. State 1994 BLD 99 and State vs. Badsha Molla, 41 DLR 11. <br/><br/>Monsur Ali Vs. The State 13 BLC 196, State Vs. Mofijuddin 4 BLD-481=10 BLC-93, State Vs. Lalu Mia, 39 DLR (AD)117, 45 DLR 660, Ali Vs. Crown 6 DLR (W.P.)52, Rahman Vs. The State of U.P. AIR 1972(SC)110, Shajahan Vs. The State 46 DLR-575, Mojibur Rahman Vs. The State 13 MLR-88. In the instant case abscondence of six accused from beginning is not conclusive proof of their guilt, it cannot be the sole basis of their conviction as there is no other evidence against them.<br/><br/>Moreover, it is the definite case of the prosecution that there was an internal feud between the parties and when there is a background of enmity and the witnesses are chance witnesses and not natural witnesses and further natural and independent witness were not produced, it is unsafe to rely on the evidence of chance witnesses to make a nexus between the accused and the crime. So we hold that there is no cogent, convincing and unimpeachable evidence on record to prove the complicity of the accused with the crime of murder. Prosecution utterly failed to bring home guilt to the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<br/><br/>It is pertinent to point out that the learned Judge convicted one set of accused and acquitted other set over the selfsame of evidence on record. There is no mis-match or distinction between the acquitted accused and the convicts so far as the ocular testimony is concern. The eye witnesses having been disbelieved against one set of accused should not be believed against other set without any independent corroboration.<br/>It is true that crime like murder is shocking in nature and also, revolting. The Crime is against Society and humanity, but the prosecution convicted the accused merely on suspicion that the accused committed the murder. There cannot be conviction for murder on mere suspicion or presumption. The commission of murder must be proved. The presumption cannot take the place of positive evidence, (1970 P. Crl. L.J.-166).<br/>It further appears to us that the instant case is absolutely a case of no evidence but the Court below without any legal evidence convicted the accused in moral view. Legal evidence in a criminal trial is the evidence of the incriminating facts and circumstances of involvement of the accused in the commission of offence inevitable pointing to their guilty as the perpetrators incompatible with the plea of their innocence. In view of the proved facts and circumstances of the present case which do not constitute any legal evidence moral conviction should not be substituted in place of the legal evidence.<br/><br/>The accused was convicted merely on suspicion without any legal evidence. To that end in view, law is now well settled that suspicion or doubt however strong it might be cannot take place of evidence or there be slightest doubt as to the involvement of the accused in the crime, he cannot be convicted. With this regard reliance are being placed in the cases of Abdul Haq and others  Vs. The State 14 BLT 485, Fazu alias Fazlur Rahman Vs. The State 1 BLC 558, Rekatfullah Vs. The State 13 DLR-750. It is further held in the case reported in AIR 1921(PC) 69, that the decision of the Court must rest upon legal ground established by legal testimony from the prosecution.<br/><br/>Moreso in all respect, the convict is also entitled to benefit of doubt. In the case of Safder Ali Vs. Crown 5 DLR(FC) 107 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>In a criminal case, it is the duty of the Court to review the entire evidence that has been produced by the prosecution and the defence. If, after an examination of the whole evidence, the Court is of the opinion that there is a reasonable possibility that the defence put forward by the accused might be true, it is clear that such a view reacts on the whole prose-cution case. In these circumstances, the accused is entitled to benefit of doubt, not as a matter of grace, but as of right, because the prosecution has not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>So, there is no cogent, convincing and unimpeachable evidence on record to prove the complicity of the accused with the crime of murder. Prosecution utterly failed to bring home guilt to the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<br/><br/>Moreover, the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence in its entirety is not well founded in the facts and circumstances of the case. Therefore, the submissions advanc-ed by the learned Deputy Attorney General are not the correct exposition of law. Therefore, we are unable to accept his submissions. On the contrary submissions advanced by the learned Counsels for the defence prevail and appear to have a good deal of force.<br/><br/>In the light of discussions made above and the preponderant judicial views emerging out of the authorities refer to above, we are of the view that the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence suffer from legal infirmities which calls for interference by this Court. Thus the reference having no merit fails and all the appeals having merit succeed.<br/><br/><strong>In the result:-</strong></div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;">Death reference No. 66 of 2006 is rejected.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The impugned Judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 30-07-2006 passed by learned Sessions Judge, Narayangonj in Session Case no. 194 of 2005 is hereby set aside and the accused are acquitted from the charge.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Let the condemned prisoner Badiuz-zaman alias Badu be set at liberty if not detained in any other case.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The appellants who are on bail are discharged from the bail bond.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Accordingly all the appeals are allowed.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">The Office is directed to send down the records at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>
