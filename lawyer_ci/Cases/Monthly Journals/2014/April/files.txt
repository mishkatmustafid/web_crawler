Eventually, the said appeal was transmitted to the Court of Additional District Judge, 8<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka for disposal, who by the impugned judgment and order dated 17.4.2007 disallowed the Revision and affirmed the order of the trial Court dated 13.8.2006 and the instant Revision application is directed against that judgment and order.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Ibrahim Khalil, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioners submits that the defendant-opposite party clearly stated in paragraph No.8 of the written statement that the suit is bad for defect of parties inasmuch as the wife of the defendant is owner of the suit property by purchase but the plaintiffs did not implead  her in the suit  though  both the Courts blow without applying its judicial mind into the facts and circumstances of the case and law bearing on the subject most illegally rejected the prayer for addition of party and the same has occasioned failure of justice. This is the only ground urged by the learned Advocate for the petitioners.<br/><br/>Mr. A. K. Mojibur Rahman, the learned Advocate appearing for the defendant-opposite party, on the other hand, opposes the Rule. He submits that the Courts below were perfectly justified in refusing the petitioner’s prayer for addition of party on the clear finding that the wife of sole defendant is not at all necessary party in the instant case.<br/><br/>I have considered the submission of the learned Advocates for both the sides and perused the Revision application, impugned judgment and other materials on record. The only question that is to be decided in the rule is, whether the Courts below have committed any illegality in rejecting the prayer for addition of party. It appears that the plaintiff-petitioners filed a suit for permanent injunction against the sole defendant-opposite party. The defendant-opposite party entered appearance in the suit and filed written statement denying most of the allegations of the plaint. The material portion of the written statement  reads as follows: “মোকদ্দমাটি পক্ষভাব দোষে বারিত, বিবাদীর সএী নালিশা ভূমিতে খরিদ সুত্রে মালিক দখলকার. তাহাকে মোকদ্দমায় পক্ষ না করায় মোকদ্দমাটি পক্ষভাব দোষে অচল ও অরক্ষনীয়”<br/><br/>On that, the plaintiff-petitioners filed an application under Order 1, Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure for adding the wife of the sole defendant as defendant No.2. The trial Court rejected the prayer for addition of party on the ground that since there is no allegation of threat against the wife of sole defendant in a suit for permanent injunction, she is not a necessary party. In revision, the learned Additional District Judge, 8<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka, however, affirmed the order of the trial Court.<br/><br/>As, I have already  noticed that in this case the sole defendant entered appearance in the suit and filed written statement stating  that the suit  is  bad for non-joinder of necessary parties as  the  wife of the sole defendant  is the owner of the suit property by purchase though the plaintiffs did not implead her in the suit.<br/><br/>The proposition of law is by now well settled that  any one is entitled to be added as a party in a suit even he is a stranger, if he has direct interest, legal or equitable, in the dispute.<br/><br/>Admittedly, in this case the sole defendant in his written statement stated that the suit is bad for defect of party since the wife of the sole defendant is the owner of the suit property by purchase though the plaintiffs did not implead her in the suit. Thus, it does not lie in the mouth of the defendant-opposite party that the wife of defendant is not a necessary party. I do not think therefore that the Courts below made a correct approach to the simple problem. The impugned judgment as well as order of the trial Court does not reflect the true position of law and fact.<br/><br/>For the reasons stated above, I am inclined to hold that the learned Additional District Judge, 8<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka seriously erred in law in affirming  the  order dated 13.8.2006 passed by the learned Senior Assistant Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Dhaka in Title Suit No.399 of 2002 rejecting the application for addition of party  without properly applying his judicial mind into the facts and circumstances of the case and law bearing on the subject and the same has resulted in an error in the impugned decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/><br/>The Rule is, therefore,  made absolute without any order as to cost, the impugned judgment and order dated 17.4.2007 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, 8<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka in Civil Revision No.410 of 2006 as well as  order of the trial Court dated 13.8.2006 passed in Title Suit No.399 of 2002 are set-aside and consequently, the application for addition of party dated 13.08.2006 of the plaintiff petitioners is allowed, Nazli Begum, the wife of sole defendant is added as defendant No. 2 in the suit.<br/><br/>Since, the matter has been dragging over a period of 10(ten) years, the trial Court concerned is directed to proceed with the suit expeditiously without giving any adjournment to any of the parties in accordance with law.<br/><br/>Let a copy of this judgment be communicated to the Courts concerned at once.<br/><br/><strong>End.</strong></div></div></div>

Ali Hossain lodged a First Information Report (<strong>shortly the FIR</strong>) on 8.3.1995 with Mohanpur Police Station, Rajshahi against 8(eight) accused-persons on the allegations under sections 143, 148, 447, 313, 323, 324, 325, 326 and 427 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>The informant alleged that the accused-persons in a preplanned way being equipped with dangerous weapons made an unlawful assembly in his homestead on 10.02.1995 at 7/7.30 a.m. to cut away different trees, from the courtyard which were planted by the informant.  Aleya Bibi, the wife of the informant and his sister-in-law (ভাবী) namely Renuka Bibi came forward to resist cutting away the trees, but they failed. When the wife of the informant and his sister-in-law were going to Singmara village to inform the informant about the occurrence, accused Nos. 1-3 i.e. Solaiman, Sobhan and Ali obstructed their way and scolded them with rough and filthy words. Then accused Solaiman delt lathi blow to the wife of the informant Aleya Bibi and fell her down on the ground and accused Solaiman also delt a dao blow on her forehead. When witness No.1 Aleya Bibi raised hue and cry, accused No.3, Ali started beating her recklessly and also poking her abdomen with a lathi. Accused No. 2, Md. Sobhan caused bleeding injury to the witness Renuka Bibi with iron rod on her hip. Upon hearing the victim’s hue and cry neighbouring witnesses appeared and saw the occurrence and saved them from the clutches of the accused-persons. The accused-persons caused damage of Tk. 10,000/-by cutting the trees. The neighbouring witnesses took the victims to Mohanpur Hospital and they got admitted thereto for treatment. During treatment foetus of 3 months of his wife, Aleya Bibi was aborted.<br/><br/>After obtaining the medical certificate the informant lodged the FIR with Mohanpur Police Station whereupon Mohanpur Police Station Case No. 2 dated 08.03.1995 was recorded against the accused -persons and the same gave rise to G.R. No. 246 of 1995.<br/><br/>After investigation police submitted Charge Sheet dated 23.3.1995 against all the accused-persons under sections 143, 148, 447, 313, 323, 324, 325, 326 and 427 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>The Trial Court on 03.8.1995 framed charge under sections 313 and 34 of the Penal Code against all the accused-persons and the charge was read over to them to which they pleaded innocence and claimed to be tried.<br/>The prosecution examined as many as 11 witnesses in order to prove the charge, while the defence examined none.<br/><br/>After closure of the evidence of the prosecution, the accused- persons were examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (<strong>hereinafter referred to as the Code, 1898</strong>) to which they further pleaded not guilty.<br/>The Trial Court after conclusion of the trial found the 2(two) appellants guilty of the offence under section 313 of the Penal Code and convicted and sentenced them as stated above and acquitted 6 (six) other accused persons of the charge.<br/><br/>Against the said judgment and order of conviction and sentence the appellants preferred this Criminal Appeal and appellant No. 1- Solaiman was granted bail by an order dated 20.4.2005.<br/><br/>Mr. K. B. Rumy, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants submits that the prosecution miserably has failed to prove the charge by producing credible witnesses beyond reasonable doubt and the victim-witnesses being P.Ws. 2 and 3 contradicted themselves in their testimonies about the time, place and manner of the occurrence, and alleged miscarriage of foetus of P.W.2-Aleya Bibi.<br/><br/>Mr. Rumy, the learned Advocate submits further that the learned Additional Sessions Judge failed to consider the material discrepancies of the prosecution’s evidence and the conviction and sentence were based on misreading and non-consideration of the evidence on record and hence, the appeal should be allowed by setting aside the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence.<br/><br/>Mr. Rumy, finally submits that the appellants were falsely implicated in the alleged occurrence out of internal feud between the appellants and the informant as they were extended from the same family.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Mr. Md. Mamunor Rashid, learned Assistant Attorney General appearing on behalf of the respondent- State submits that the prosecution proved the charge by producing credible evidence and the conviction and sentence are well founded and need not be interfered with by this Court.<br/><br/>The learned A.A.G submits further that the Trial Court upon proper appreciation of the evidences on record convicted the appellants and thus nothing remains to interfere with the decision of the Trial Court.<br/><br/>For coming to proper decision about sustainability of the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence, we need to examine and assess the evidence on record keeping in view of the charge framed. Accordingly the relevant evidence on record is briefly presented below:</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">P.W. 1 Md. Ali Hossain is the informant, who reiterated the facts as stated in the FIR, but is not a witness of the occurrence or in other words the informant is a hearsay witness. However he proved the FIR as exhibit 1 and his signature therein as exhibit 1/1.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">P.W. 2 Aleya Bibi is one of the victims of the alleged occurrence, who stated that the occurrence took place on 10.2.1995 at about 7/7.30 a.m. She stated that accused Solaiman caused her injury and fell her down on the ground and accused Ali dealt lathi blow indiscriminately on her body<strong>.</strong> This P.W.2 also stated that accused Sobhan dealt rod blow to her sister-in-law, Renuka Bibi (P.W. 3) when she had come to the place of occurrence upon hearing her hue and cry. She also stated that she and Renuka Bibi (P.W. 3) were admitted to the hospital and her foetus aged about 3 months was aborted during her treatment.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In her cross-examination she stated that accused Solaiman is her cousin (চাচাতো ভাই). She further stated that when her foetus was miscarriaged she could not know. She also stated that after 4/5 days the foetus was shown to her. She could not say whether any bleeding was caused or not. She denied the suggestion that she deposed falsely due to internal feud between them and the accused-persons.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">P.W. 3 Renuka Bibi is allegedly another victim of the occurrence, who stated that the accused-persons including the appellants indiscriminately caused injury to her, when she went forward to resist them. She also stated that accused Solaiman and Ali dealt lathi blow to her sister-in-law, Aleya, P.W.2.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In her cross-examination she stated that the foetus of Aleya (p.w.2) was aborted after 4/5 days of the occurrence and Aleya was admitted to the hospital for 15 days.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">P.W. 4.  Alauddin is not  the witness of the occurrence.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">P.W. 5  Md. Iqbal Hossain and P.W.6 Raja were declared hostile and defence declined to cross-examine them.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">P.W. 7 Halima did not disclose the name of any of the accused- persons involving them in the occurrence and defence declined to cross -examine this P.W.7 .</li><li style="text-align: justify;">P.W. 8, Dr. Md. Belal Hossain, who treated the victim, Renuka (P.W.3) in the Mohonpur Thana Health Complex on 10.2.1995 at about 3 p.m. and also treated other victim Aleya Bibi (P.W.2) on the same day at about 3.15.p.m.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In his cross-examination he stated that “বাচ্চা কত বড় ছিল তাহা রিপোর্টে  লেখা নাই। বাচ্চাটা কি হলো তাহা জানি না। বাচ্চাটির সম্পর্কে রিপোর্টে কিছুই লেখা নাই। দারোগা আমার নিকট থেকে রক্তমাখা কাপড়  সিজ করে নাই। দারোগা সাহেব আমার নিকট হতে বাচ্চা সিজ করে নাই। ”</li><li style="text-align: justify;">P.W. 9 and 10 were not the witnesses of the occurrence.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">P.W. 11 Shamsul Alam is the Investigation Officer of the case, who stated that he went to the place of the occurrence, recorded the statements of the witnesses under section 161 of the Code, 1898, prepared the index and the sketch map and after investigation he submitted charge sheet against the accused-persons.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In his cross-examination he stated that the occurrence took place on 10.2.1995 and the FIR was lodged on 8.3.1995. But no explanation of the delay was explained in the FIR. He further deposed that he did not seize any blood stain cloth of the victim, Aleya Bibi (P.W.2).</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">We have heard the learned A.A.G, perused the impugned judgment and evidence on record and also considered the ground taken in the petition of appeal.<br/><br/>The informant is not the witness of the occurrence, who lodged the FIR on 08.3.1995 alleging the date of occurrence on 10.2.1995. But in the FIR we do not find any explanation of causing delay of 26(twenty six) days in lodging the FIR. P.W. 2 Aleya is the principal victim of the alleged occurrence, who stated that her foetus was miscarriaged on 10.2.1995 in the Hospital. But in the deposition of P.W. 3 Renuka stated that the foetus of Aleya was miscarriaged after 4/5 days of the occurrence, who is also a victim of the alleged occurrence. P.W.2 Aleya Bibi also did not state about injuries of her abdomen caused by the appellant Ali at the time of alleged occurrence. Victim Aleya Bibi (P.W.2) deposed that she did not know when her foetus was aborted in the hospital nor could she say whether any bleeding was caused when the foetus was aborted. In the instant case only P.W. 2 and 3 were the victim-witnesses, who contradicted themselves in their testimonies about the alleged occurrence as stated in the FIR.<br/><br/>Dr.Md. Belal Hossain (P.W. 8) who treated the victim Aleya Bibi stated in his cross-examination that nothing was written in the medical report about the foetus of the victim Aleya Bibi (P.W. 2).<br/><br/>The other prosecution witnesses were not the witnesses of the occurrence.<br/><br/>Upon consideration of the evidence on record as produced by the prosecution it appears that the prosecution miserably failed to prove the time, place, and manner of the occurrence as well as its case as a whole, but the learned Additional Sessions Judge upon misreading and non-consideration of the evidence on record convicted the appellants under section 313 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>Moreover, so far the medical jurispru-dence is concerned, it is absurd that a lady being the P.W.2 Aleya Bibi would not have knowledge about her miscarriage of foetus and whether any bleeding was caused in such miscarriage.<br/>We do not find any material on record to sustain the conviction of the appellants.<br/><br/>Moreover, there is nothing on record to be considered as a reason for believing the testimonies of the P.Ws. 2 and 3, who were the victim witnesses of the alleged occurrence as they contradicted themselves in their testimonies about abortion of Aleya Bibi (P.W.2) inasmuch as the testimony of the allege victim, Aleya is absurd.<br/><br/>In view of the above, we hold that the prosecution has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellants committed the alleged offence under section 313 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>We find no reason to agree with the finding and the decision arrived at by the trial court. Accordingly we hold that the appeal should be allowed.<br/><br/>In the result, the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 26.4.1999 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Rajshahi in Session Case No. 88 of 1995 is set aside.<br/><br/>The convict appellants (1) Ali, son of Late Johir (2) Md. Solaiman, son of Late Inat Ali Mondol both of village –Maldia, Police Station–Mohanpur, District-Rajshahi are acquitted  of the charge  and released from their bail bond, if furnished any.<br/><br/>Send copy of this judgment along with the lower court record to the learned Additional Sessions Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> court, Rajshahi.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Ali Advocate, instructed by Mr. Ziaur Rahman, Advocate-on-Record.<br/><strong>For the Respondent Nos. 2-6: </strong>Not represented.<br/> <br/><u><strong>CIVIL PETITION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL No. 355  OF 2012</strong></u><br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size:20px">JUDGEMENT</span></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><u><strong>Muhammad Imman Ali, J:</strong></u><br/><br/>This petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgement and order dated 20.01.2011 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 2942 of 2010 making the Rule absolute with a direction upon the writ respondent No.2 to implement the decision of the Upozila Jalmahal Management Committee, dated 9th February, 2010, and thereby take a decision in accord-ance with the Rules to demise the fishery concerned to one of the two remaining societies namely (1) Lahlamary Fisheries Co-operative and (2) Ramibari Fisheries Co-operative Society forthwith.<br/><br/>The facts relevant for disposal of this petition are that the writ petitioner applied for long term lease under Development Scheme for the “Shukro Bari Damus Dighar Fishery” situated within Upazila-Shibigonj, District-Chapai Nababgonj. His application was filed before the Ministry, which called for report from the Deputy Commissioner, Chapai Nababgonj who then forwarded the application to the Upazila Jolmohal Management Committee for investigation and report. Thereafter, the report of the Upazila Jolmohal Management Committee was forwarded to the Deputy Commissioner for consideration. However, the District Jolmohal Management Committee ignoring the findings and recommendation of the Upazila Jolmohal Management Committee decided to recommend lease in favour of the writ respondent No.6-petitioner herein.<br/><br/>The writ petitioner’s contention was that the membership of the writ respondent No.6- the Daipukuria Union Matshajibi Samabaya Samity Ltd. did not consist of genuine fishermen of locality as the President of the Samity was listed in the voters’ list as businessman and as such the co-operative society consisting of non-fisherman cannot qualify to get lease. The writ petitioner further contended that the writ respondent No.6 society is not a riparian fishermen Co-operative Society and that members of the said society are living away from the fishery and as per the Nitimala-2009 they are not qualified for getting lease.<br/><br/>Rule Nisi was issued by the High Court Division upon the respondents to show cause as to why the granting of lease of the fishery concerned to writ respondent No.6 for a period of 6(six) years with effect from 1417-1422 B.S. should not be declared to have been made without lawful authority. The operation of the memo granting lease was stayed.<br/><br/>The writ respondent No.6 (petitioner herein) filed an affidavit-in-opposition stating, inter alia that the writ respondent No.6 was also an applicant for grant of lease under the Development Scheme for the same fishery and that the Deputy Commissioner prepared a report in respect of his application and forwarded the same to the writ respondent No. 1 for giving a decision. He further contended that the writ respondent No.6 quoted the highest proposed lease money and for that reason recommendation was made to grant lease in it’s favour.<br/><br/>After hearing all the necessary parties the High Court Division by the impugned judgement and order made the Rule absolute holding that the lease agreement executed in favour of the writ respondent No.6 stands rescinded ab initio and at the same time directed the writ respondent No.2 to implement the decision of the Upozilla Jalmahal Management Committee, dated 09.02.2010, and thereby to take a decision in accordance with the Rules to lease the fishery concerned to one of the two remaining applicant societies namely (1) Lahlamary Fisheries Co-operative and (2) Ramibari Fisheries Co-operative Society.<br/><br/>Mr. Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan, the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that the Nitimala provides that lease under the Development Scheme is to be given to applicants who earn their livelihood mainly from fishing. He further submits that the Samity of the petitioner has been duly registered upon finding that the members of the Samity are genuine fishermen. He points out that Annexure-11 and 12 to the writ petition supports the contention of the petitioner that he and his society members are genuine fishermen and accordingly the lease was properly granted to them. He submits that without challenging or canceling the registration of the Samity the writ petitioner cannot challenge the grant of lease in their favour. Finally, by reference to the voters’ list the learned Counsel submits that the members of the writ petitioner’s Samity are also described in the voters’ list as businessman or farmer. Therefore, the impugned judgement and order directing lease to be granted to them is erroneous.<br/><br/>Dr. Md. Ali, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent No.1 submits that the voters’ list is compiled upon information gathered in the locality and reflects the true profession of the voters’ and, therefore, when the writ respondent No.6 is described as a businessman, and the same description appears in his affidavit-in-opposition, he cannot be entitled to get lease of a fishery where a pre-condition is that the applicant must be member of a society of genuine fisherman. He further points out that the purpose of the Nitimala was to alleviate the poverty of real fishermen, i.e., those whose livelihood is from catching and selling fish. He points out from Annexure-12 that the petitioner herein has been described as a fish cultivator and businessman, which is far from a genuine fisherman who earns his livelihood by catching and selling fish.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Counsel for the parties concerned and perused the impugned judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record.<br/><br/>We find from the Nitimala, 2009 that the lease of fishery under long term development scheme is to be given to any society which is a registered society of genuine fishermen and that if it is found that any society consists of any member who is not a real fisherman then the society will not be eligible to get lease of a Government Jalmohal. A real fisherman has been defined as one who catches and sells fish from a natural source and that is his primary source of livelihood.<br/><br/>The High Court Division in the impu-gned judgement did not accept the contention of the instant petitioner that someone engaged in the business of rearing and selling fish is also to be accepted as a fisherman. So, the judgement of the High Court Division cannot be faulted. On the other hand, the membership of fishermen society, of which the petitioner is the president, still remains valid, although his description as businessman in the voters’ list tends to support the contention that he is not a genuine fisherman within the meaning of the Nitimala, 2009.<br/><br/>It is the contention of Mr. Wadud Bhuiyan that the direction given by the High Court Division to grant lease of the fishery concerned to one of the two remaining societies is also based on misreading of evidence on record. We also find that the voters’ list of the locality shows that the members of the writ petitioner’s Samity are also described variously as businessman / farmer/worker etc.<br/><br/>In view of the submissions from the Bar and the evidence pointed out to us, we are of the opinion that the High Court Division rightly ordered recission of the lease granted in favour of the writ respondent No.6. But the direction to grant lease in favour of one of the two remaining societies does not appear to be in conformity with the requirement of the Nitimala, 2009 as some of the members of those two societies appear to be described as businessman /farmer.<br/><br/>In the facts and circumstances described above, we are of the view that the instant Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal be disposed of with modification of the order passed by the High Court Division. The direction to grant lease to one of the other two applicants’ Samity is set aside. The respondents are directed to start fresh process to lease out the fishery in question in accordance with the provisions of the Nitimala 2009. The respondents are directed to allow the petitioner four months time to hand over possession of the fishery in question and also to refund to the petitioner the proportionate lease money for the unexpired period of the lease.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Moazzam Husain, J</u></em></strong><strong><u>.</u></strong></span><br/> <br/>This rule was issued at the instance of the judgment- debtor petitioner calling in question an order dated 13.11.2002 passed by the Joint District Judge, Artha Rin Adalat No.1, Panchagarh, in Money Execution Case No. 8 of 2002.<br/><br/>The backdrop of facts giving rise to this rule, in short, is that the decree-holder opposite party obtained on 13.9.1988 a money decree of Tk.2, 36,761.50 against the present petitioner No.1 in Money Suit No.2 of 1988 passed by the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Panchagarh. The suit was for realization of Tk.1, 93,472.50 taken by the petitioner No.1 (judgment-debtor) from the opposite party Bank (decree-holder) against a small oil mill project. Pursuant to failure of the judgment-debtor to pay off the money the Bank initiated Money Execution Case No. 21 of 1993 in the court of Subordinate Judge, Artha Rin Adalat No.1 Panchagarh. During pendency of the execution case the judgment-debtor along with his two full brothers (Petitioner Nos. 2 and 3) filed on 29.1.1994 a joint petition (Annex-B) in the execution case stating, <em>inter alia,</em> that following a negotiation between the judgment-debtor, his brothers and the highest authority of the Bank the terms of the loan was re-scheduled with remission of the interests.  His brothers mortgaged a piece of land of their own as a matter of security to the loan and executed irrevocable power of attorney in favour of the bank. In view of the development he prayed, he might be allowed easy installments to pay of the outstanding dues on the loan account. Learned judge passed an order on 30.1.1994 disposing of execution case in terms of compromise allowing five years’ time to pay off the loan money with 3-monthly installments.<br/><br/>The 5 years’ time-frame expired on 30.1.1999 but the dues were not paid by the judgment-debtor on various excuses.  The decree-holder Bank was ultimately led to file  another application on 26.6.2002 for execution which gave rise to Execution Case No. 8 of 2002 in the court of the Joint District Judge and Artha Rin Adalat No.1, Panchagarh, this time for realization of Tk.9, 74,985/-. The present petitioner along with his said two brothers appeared in the execution case and filed a joint written objection on 28.9.2002 denying the liability essentially on the ground of limitation.  On 13.11.2002 an application was filed by the judgment-debtor asking for dismissal of the execution case basically on two grounds, namely, that the execution case was barred by limitation and that inclusion of his two brothers in the execution case is illegal as they were not party to the suit.<br/><br/>The application was heard by the learned  Joint District Judge and upon hearing learned Judge rejected the same by his impugned order dated 13.11.2002 with observations, <em>inter alia,</em> that the judgment-debtor  paid Tk.2,06,000/-. He lastly paid Tk.500/- on 31.1.2001. The amount Tk.9, 74,925/- is still outstanding which the judgment-debtor is liable to pay as per the conditions of the compromise. <br/><br/>The judgment-debtor and his said two brothers obtained this rule challenging the aforesaid order of rejection on the common grounds agitated before the execution court.<br/><br/>Mr. Mushfiqur Rahman, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioners submitted at the outset that his case lies in the question of limitation and he was not inclined to focus much on the other point raised in the revisional application. Mr. Mushfiq submits by way of illustration that the decree was passed on 13.9.1988 and after 5 years from the date of decree an application was made for execution which gave rise to Execution Case No. 21 of 1993.  On the compromise petition filed on 19.1.1994 the learned Judge passed his order on 30.1.1994 allowing the petitioner to pay off the outstanding dues within 5 years by 3-monthly installments. Five years’ time allowed by the court elapsed on 30.1.1999 allegedly without full payment of the dues.  No steps for realization of money were taken by the Bank until 26.6.2002 on which date aforesaid execution case i.e., Execution Case No. 8 of 2002, was filed. This, Mr. Mushfiq submits, means that the second  execution case was filed after 13 years 9 months from the date of decree; eight and half months from the date of disposal of the first execution in 1994 and at least 3 ½ years after the expiry  of 5 years’ time-frame allowed by court. Therefore, he insisted, the execution case is plainly barred by limitation in view of Article 182 of the Limitation Act read with Section 48 of the Code of Civil Procedure, shortly, “the Code”. In support of his contention  Mr. Mushfiq referred to the case of <em>Bangladesh Jatio Samabaya Bank Limited v. Sangbad Daily Papers and other</em> reported in 36 DLR 5 and another case ie, <em>ADC Revenue, Pabna v. Abdul Halim Miah</em> reported in 48 DLR (AD), 141.<br/><br/>Mr. Saidur Rahman learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the opposite party does not seem to oppose or controvert the sequence of facts presented by Mr. Mushfiqur Rahman. His contention is that the case is not barred by limitation in that where a decree or order directs any payment of money at a certain date the time limit is 12 years and computation of time starts from the date of default not from the date of decree or order.   The second line of argument sought to be advanced by him is that his case is saved from the bar of limitation by virtue of Sub-section (2) (a) of Section 48 of the Code which says, inter alia, that if the decree-holder is prevented by the judgment-debtor from executing the decree by fraud or force the court is competent to order execution even after 12 years provided by Section 48 (1) (b) of the Code.<br/><br/>In his bid to make out a case of ‘fraud’  Mr. Saidur Rahman urged upon us to take notice of the conduct of the judgment-debtor  from the date of decree down to the date of filing the second execution case in 2002. He submits that the loan was taken against a small project under a special scheme of the Bank. It needs no mention that in all cases of loan against industrial project the Bank as financing institution naturally remains interested more in the success of the project than in ready realization of money.   The judgment-debtor, he argued, taking advantage of the positive attitude of the Bank resorted to cunning devices from the outset to avoid payment. Soon after the decree was passed he began to overplay his sincerity to pay off the loan should the bank go soft on him. He set up plea that his mill was going sick and unless the interest was remitted and the loan terms were re-scheduled the project might fail and in the event none of the parties would benefit. The judgment-debtor, Mr. Rahman argued, in his bid to deceive the bank moved up to the Board of Directors well within 3 years’ from decree and succeeded in persuading the authority about his <em>bona fide</em> by promising  fresh-security against the loan through mortgage of land as mentioned above. The highest authority of the Bank stepped into the trap set by the judgment-debtor and after long negotiations remitted the interest of all kinds and re-scheduled the terms of the loan instead of taking recourse to execution process. <br/><br/>Mr. Rahman further contended that the judgment- debtor by reference to the re-scheduling of the loan as above filed the so-called compromise petition in court and asked for easy installments for payment.  Learned court allowed five years’ time with installments for payment which ended in January, 1999. The judgment-debtor continued with his secret design to deceive the bank and kept giving promises to pay the dues. Finally on 31.7.2001 he paid Tk. 500/-as a gesture of his pretended good intention. The bank this time got disillusioned and realized the hidden design of the judgment-debtor to deceive the bank and finally brought the second execution case on 26.6.2002. All the incidents and conduct, Mr. Rahman contended, can only be explained upon the proposition of ‘fraud’ as contemplated in Section 48(2) which, he contended, empowers the court to order execution any time beyond 12 years provided by Section 48(1) of the Code.<br/><br/>In support of his case Mr. Saidur Rahman referred to the case of <em>Bishwanath Prasad Mahtha and another v. Lachhmi Narain</em> reported in AIR 1935 Patna, 380 and another case ie, <em>Saifur Rahman and others v. Haider Shah and another</em> reported in 19 DLR (SC) 433.<br/><br/>A plain reading of the revisional application <em>vis-a-vis</em> the law involved suggests that the fate of the rule hinges more on technical question of law than on facts. The question that is mooted here is whether the execution case complained against is barred in view of Section 48 of the Code of Civil Procedure read with Article 182 of the Limitation Act?<br/> <br/>Section 48 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“48.- <em>(1) Where an application to execute a decree not being a decree granting an injunction has been made no order for the execution of the same decree shall be made upon any fresh application presented after the expiry of twelve years from:</em><br/><em>a) the date of the decree sought to be executed, or,</em><br/><em>b) where the decree or any Subsequent order directs any payment of money or the delivery of any property to be to be made at a certain date or at recurring period, the date of default in making the payment or delivery in respect of which the application seeks  to execute the decree.</em><br/><em>(2) Nothing in this Section shall be deemed-</em><br/><em>a) to prevent the Court from ordering the execution of a decree upon an application presented after the expiry of the said term of twelve years, where the judgment-debtor has, by fraud or force, prevented the execution of the decree at some time within twelve years immediately  before  the date of application; or </em><br/><em>b) to limit or otherwise affect the operation of article 183 of the First Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1908 (X of 1908). </em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the case of <em>Bangladesh Jatya Samabaya</em><em> Bank</em> reported in 36 DLR (AD) 5 and ADC Revenue case reported in 48 DLR (AD) 141, cited by Mr. Mushfiqur Rahman the view taken by the Appellate Division is that 12 years limitation for execution of decree is the maximum limit allowed by law but the first execution must, however, be made within 3 years from decree and no subsequent application, if any, should exceed 3 years from the final order passed in the preceding execution case. In ADC Revenue Case (<em>supra</em>) our Appellate Division held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“.. both Section 48 CPC and Article 182 of the First Schedule to the Limitation Act provide the period of limitation for execution of a decree. The Civil Procedure Code fixes the longest period whereas the Limitation Act fixes the earliest period to take the first step in execution and the Subsequent steps known as steps-in-aid.  .. an application for execution has, therefore, to satisfy first Article 182 of the Limitation Act being the earliest period prescribed and then also Section 48 CPC which prescribed the maximum period of limitation. If the execution petitions is hit by any of the two it is to fail.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The above decision of the Appellate Division came in the factual background of condoning the delay in making petitions for execution beyond 3 years time provided by Article 182 of the Limitation Act finally exceeding the outer limit of 12 years provided by Section 48 of the Code by the trial court on ground of continued insanity of the decree-holder and affirmed by the High Court Division in revision holding that Section 48 of the Code did not have application in the case.<br/><br/>It is clear from the above decisions that Section 48(1) of the Code and Article 182 of the Limitation Act are construed by the Appellate Division to mean that there is both earliest and longest time for putting decree into execution and violation of either of the limitations is held to be fatal.<br/><br/>In the instant case it appears that second execution case was filed apparently beyond 3 years’ from the date of decree. The judgment-debtor does not deny the fact either. The second execution case was filed in 2002 which by simple calculation is beyond 12 years from the decree. In needs hardly be mentioned that in view of the decision of the Appellate Division the execution case is barred by limitation. But that is not the only point raised here. The second and the most crucial point raised is distinctly removed from the issue decided by the Appellate Division. Mr. Saidur Rahman, learned Advocate, besides his first line of defense, has tried to make out a case of fraud as contemplated under Sub-Section (2) of Section 48 of the Code.<br/><br/>The case sought to be canvassed by Mr. Saidur Rahman is that the judgment-debtor by his fraudulent conduct prevented the decree-holder from taking out execution against him within time. Now the court is competent to see whether the decree-holder is so prevented and, if it is so found, can order execution even after expiry of 12 years’ time as per Sub-Section (2) of Section 48 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/>Sub-Section (2) of Section 48 of the Code, as is quoted above, is an overriding clause that empowers executing court to order execution even beyond 12 years’ time if it is found that the judgment-debtor, by fraud or force, has prevented the decree-holder from executing the decree at some time within the period of 12 years immediately before the date of application. The scope and ambit of ‘fraud’ for the purpose of the section   is now settled more or less.<br/><br/>For the purpose of Section 48(2) of the Code the word ‘fraud’ is liberally construed by the superior courts. In <em>Saifur Rahamn v Haidar Shah</em>, 19 DLR (SC) 433, the then Pakistan Supreme Court held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The term ‘fraud’ in this section has to be interpreted in liberal sense as including any improper means resorted to for preventing execution.  It covers not only deceit but also circumvention.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In <em>Biswanath v Lachhmi</em>, AIR 1935 Pat 380, a Division Bench of Patna High Court held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“What is quite clearly contemplated</em><em>, apart from the definition of the term itself, (fraud) is some action on the part of the judgment-debtor which prevents the decree-holder from taking out execution proceedings and thus allowing time to run against him or some action by judgment-debtor which entices the decree-holder to hold his hand”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Similar view has been taken in <em>Gobardhan v Daudayal</em>, AIR 1931 All 301; <em>Raj Sham v Damar</em>, 11 CWN 440 and <em>Adaikappa v Netsan</em>, AIR 1931 Mad 381and <em>Abdul Khadir, P. v Ajiyar Ahmmad and others </em>reported in  35 ILR Mad 670, Power of the court appears to be spelt out in no uncertain terms that if the decree-holder is found to be prevented by the judgment-debtor by fraud or force from taking out execution it is competent in its discretion to override the 12 years time prescribed by law and direct execution of decree anytime beyond the limitation.<br/><br/>Reverting back to the facts it transpires that there are some admitted positions, namely, that a certain amount of loan was taken by the petitioner No.1 (judgment-debtor) from the opposite party bank that he failed to pay off the loan in full till today far less on schedule. The bank filed two execution cases both beyond time prescribed by law. The judgment-debtor has seized of the weakness of the execution case and urges upon for the right vested in him due on the failure of the decree-holder to execute his decree.<br/><br/>A close scrutiny of factual developments around failure of the decree-holder bank in taking out execution in time presents a peculiar scenario of the conduct of the judgment-debtor. A decree-holder, that too a bank has no earthly reason to avoid execution. Curiously for the bank, it filed both the execution cases beyond time. This is self-explanatory and must have some or other back-story that consistently prevented the bank from initiation of execution cases.<br/><br/>Record shows that the decree was passed in 1988 and first execution case was filed in 1992. The so-called compromise petition suggests that the judgment-debtor moved to the Board of Directors of the decree-holder bank for remission of the interests, rescheduling of the loan and other facilities. It appears that the highest authority of the bank was finally prevailed over and remission of interests and re-scheduling etc was made. In taking the advantage the judgment-debtor got his two brothers tagged along and made them to provide fresh security against the loan by mortgaging pieces of land of their own and to execute irrevocable power of attorney in favour of the bank. The entire process from initiation to the end entails consumption of time. Mr. Saidur Rahman, Learned Advocate submitted with emphasis that the <em>tadbir</em> started immedi-ately after the decree was passed ie, far before the expiry of 3 years’ limitation for execution. In view of the volume of works and runaround involved in the job we have no reason to disbelieve the case of the decree-holder that the <em>tadbir</em> so started.  If it is so the decree-holder would naturally prefer pursuing the matter outside court and thereby incur delay in filing the execution case. The delay so incurred, in our opinion, may reasonably be explained upon the proposition that the decree-holder was prevented by fraud in taking out execution at sometime within 3 years from decree. In <em>Abdul Khadir (supra)</em>, a Division Bench of the Madras High Court made the following observations:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Fraud at sometime within 12 years period to the application for execution being sufficient to entitle the decree-holder to ask for execution, it is clear that it is not incumbent on him to show continuous diligence during all the time prior to the application. The language of the section also shows clearly that the decree-holder is not bound to show that, but for the fraud or force complained of, he would have realized the fruit of his decree. All that has to be proved is that the judgment-debtor, by fraud or force, at sometime prevented the execution that is, in my opinion, made the decree-holder’s attempts to execute at the time to which fraud relates, unsuccessful.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Payment of some money in 2001 by the judgment-debtor indicates that he kept the decree-holder in good humour althrough and by fraudulent means prevented the bank from going for execution of the decree.<br/><br/>The judgment-debtor being guilty of fraud within the meaning of Section 48(2) it must, therefore, be held that he prevented the decree-holder by fraud from taking out execution against him and thereby keeps the decree alive so as to be put into execution. The execution case filed after 12 years period from decree thus being protected under Section 48(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure is maintainable. <br/><br/>In the result, the rule is discharged.  The impugned order passed by the executing court is maintained and the order of stay granted earlier by this court is hereby vacated.<br/><br/>There shall, however, be no order as to cost.<br/><br/>Communicate a copy of this judgment at once.<br/><br/><strong>End.</strong></div></div></div>

Those are F type accommodations and as per Rule 4 of the Bangladesh Allocation Rules, 1982, those are reserved and earmarked only for Senior Secretaries to Joint Secretaries and the Senior Secretaries/Secretaries would obviously get preference in getting allocation of the said earmarked flats as per the Rules, norms and practice. Until a single Secretary to the Government is in pipe line to get the said flat, the other officers with the rank below the Secretary should not be accommodated therein until the said earmarked type flats becomes available to them. . . .

Thus, it </strong><strong>appears that the amount of residence allowance</strong><strong> of Tk. 26,600/- is too low to arrange for a suitable accommodation for the Judges privately.</strong><br/><strong>In absence of any guidelines for assessment and determination of the amount of house </strong><strong>allowance, there is always a serious likeliness</strong><strong> of deprivation of enjoying rational amount of house allowance by which a Judge may be </strong><strong>able to cope up with the expenses of privately</strong><strong> rented house.  . . .(108 and 109)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Supreme Court Judges (Remuneration and Privileges) Ordinance, 1978</strong><br/><strong>Section 4(1)(a)</strong><br/><strong>The executive cannot be allowed to enjoy the absolute authority in the matter of fixation of remuneration and/or with providing other privileges for the Supreme Court Judges as its ‘royal privilege’ or prerogative. If such a process is allowed to continue, the independence of judiciary will remain a distant dream.</strong><br/><strong>Presence of an alternative option in Section 4(i)(a) of the Ordinance, 1978 in the event of failure by the respondents to provide the Judges with houses defeats the scheme of the law that “<u>A Judge shall be entitled to, and </u></strong><strong><u>provided with</u></strong><strong>” in a three-fold way. Firstly, it</strong><strong> paves the way for the concerned authorities to refrain from providing the Judges with furnished government houses, secondly, the residence allowance figured therein does not become of any use for the Judges to arrange for privately rented house and, thirdly, threatens the independence of the judiciary as the judiciary is pushed to be dependent upon the members of the executive for increase of the amount of the residence allowance by making overturns to them. . . .(112 and 118)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 147(2)</strong><br/><strong>Supreme Court Judges (Remuneration and Privileges) Ordinance, 1978</strong><br/><strong>Section 4(1)(a)</strong><br/><strong>From a plain reading of Article 147(2) it appears that the State shall not make any legislation to the disadvantage of the Supreme Court Judges.

Khurshid Alam Sarkar, J:</strong></u></span><br/> <br/>All these three writ petitions have taken up simulteneously for hearing as common questions of law and fact are involved and, accordingly, they are being disposed of altogether by this single judgment.<br/> <br/>Initially, on 20.05.2013, Rules were issued in all the above writ petitions in the following terms:<br/> <br/>          Let a Rule Nisi be issued calling upon the respondents to show cause as to why the overall actions of the respondents in allocating the Government houses for the dignitaries positioned at serial no. 5 (Cabinet Ministers) to 16 (Secretaries to the Government) of the Warrant of Precedence, including their action in the allotment of House No. 12, Minto Road, Dhaka in favour of respondent no. 3 in defiance to the recommendation of the Hon’ble President of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh for allocation of the said house in favour of a Judge of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, being in violation of the Supreme Court Judges (Remuneration and Privileges) Ordinance, 1978, the Bangladesh Allocation Rules, 1982 and the Warrant of Precedence, shall not be declared to have been done without lawful authority and of no legal effect.<br/> <br/>         And why the respondents shall not be directed to arrange <em>“a furnished residence free from the payment of any rent and charges on account of municipal taxes and local rate and of the use of electricity, water and gas”</em> (bungalow type or similar accommodation) for all the persons holding Constitutional positions, specially for the dignitaries under Serial No. 5 to 10 of the Warrant of Precedence;<br/> <br/>         And, further, to show cause as to why the respondents shall not be directed to periodi-cally review the said provisions of Section 4(1) (a) of the Supreme Court Judges (Remuner-ation and Privileges) Ordinance, 1978, so far as it relates to the amount of the money for house allowance, in order to update and harmonize the same with the socio-economic conditions of the country;<br/> <br/>         And also to show cause as to why, in case of failure of making such residential allotment in favour of the aforesaid dignitaries, the respondents shall not be directed to bear the costs incurred from the house rents, bills, charges and all other expenses at actual, in addition to the fixed house allowance, and/or pass such other or further order or orders as to this Court may seem fit and proper.<br/> <br/>At the time of issuance of the above Rules on 30.05.2013 the following interim orders were passed upon the respondents:<br/> <br/>Respondent nos. 1 and 2 are directed to submit a list of total number of bungalow type houses including the number and names of allottees/present occupants of the same within 2(two) weeks from the date of receipt of this order.<br/> <br/>Pending hearing of the Rule, the respondents are directed not to allot any bungalow type house/similar accommodation to anyone without providing the same to the dignitaries under Serial No. 5 to 10 of the Warrant of Precedence.<br/> <br/>Further, the respondents are restrained by an order of injunction from handing over the possession of 12, Minto Road, Dhaka to respondent no. 3.<br/> <br/>On 20.06.2013, upon the prayer of the petitioners, a supplementary Rule was issued along with interim order in the following terms;<br/> <br/>Let a supplementary Rule Nisi be issued calling upon the respondents to show cause as to why the 2<sup>nd</sup> part of Section 4(1)(a) of the Supreme Court Judges (Remuneration and Privileges) Ordinance, 1978 shall not be declared to be ultra vires as the same is violative of Article 27, 29, 31 and 147(2) of the Constitution and, also, for being contradictory and repugnant to the first part of the said provisions of Section 4(1)(a) of the said Ordinance, 1978.<br/> <br/>Pending hearing of the Rule, respondent no. 1 is directed to submit a list of total number of flats/houses of the superior category which have been allotted to the Joint Secretaries to Secretaries with number and particulars of the present occupants before this Court within 10 (ten) days.<br/> <br/>Succinctly, the background of the case is that the writ petitioners in all the above three writ petitions are the practising advocates of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh and, day before the issuance of the instant Rules, they together with a handful young advocates approached this Court in the form and style of “mentioning” a particular matter by placing some news clippings/reportings which state that the Government has allotted House No. 12, Minto Road, Dhaka, in favour of the Secretary, Ministry of Industry despite the same being recommended by the Hon’ble President of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh for an Hon’ble Judge of the High Court Division and submitted that the said news, having caught sight of the petitioners, prompted them to engage in investigation into the matter and it was revealed that while a number of Hon’ble Judges’ applications for accommodation, after the same being forwarded by the Hon’ble Chief Justice of Bangladesh, are lying unnoticed in the Ministry of Public Works and Housing, the members of the administrative branch, ranking from Joint Secretary to Senior Secretary, are being regularly endowed with luxurious apartments and bungalows and, thus, the cases of Hon’ble Judges are being purposely ignored. Then, they submitted that they felt dismayed at the deplorable treatment of the state function-aries in providing the Judges of this Court with their legal entitlements and, hence, they consider the matter as a fit case for issuance of a Suo motu Rule and, accordingly, prayed for the same. However, this Court, instead of issu-ance of a Suo motu Rule, asked the petitioners to come up with a formal application, if they find themselves to be aggrieved with the actions of the respondents.<br/> <br/>At this juncture, on the following day, the petitioners filed 3 (three) applications under Article 102 of the Constitution. All of the petitions are almost with the same contentions and prayers. It is stated in all the writ petitions that the state functionaries, who are responsible for fixation of remunerations, privileges and other benefits, including allocation of suitable accommodation for the Judges of the Supreme Court, are discriminating against the latter in allocation of the residence in violation of the relevant laws of the land. It is stated that the Judges of this Court are not supposed to approach anyone in the Republic other than the Hon’ble President of the Republic, the highest authority of the land, and when the application of Mr. Justice Md. Jahangir Hossain for allotment of House No. 12 at Minto Road was recommended by the Hon’ble President, respondent Nos. 1&amp;2 were duty bound to comply with the said recommendation, but, instead, they allotted the House to respondent no. 3. It is stated that the respondents have committed a serious misconduct by defying the recommendation of the Hon’ble President of the Republic and thereby allotting the said house to respondent no. 3. The underlying concern of the petitioners is that unless the impugned actions of the respondents are adjudicated upon at an earliest convenience, it shall, at the very least, establish a dubious precedent of action arbitrarily and peremptorily taken with impunity against the legitimate rights and interests of a member of the Bench of the Superior Judiciary, thereby, operating inimically to the interests and image of the Supreme Judiciary as a whole.<br/> <br/>It is stated that lawyers are the integral part of the judiciary and as the conscious citizens of the country and members of the legal profession the petitioners believe in the independence of the judiciary and they are tirelessly working towards the establishment of the rule of law as they hold the Constitution of Bangladesh in high esteem as sacred inviolable superior law of the land. The petitioners stated that they consider the said incident to be a degrading treatment for the Hon’ble Judges of the Supreme Court with a perilous consequence to the state which consists of the  Executive, the Legislative and the Judiciary and, as such, the petitioners felt the urge to come up with these applications in the form of public interest litigation (PIL) for vindication of a public grievance related to the greater interest of the judiciary with a view to strengthening the position of the judiciary and, thereby, ensure the independence of the judiciary. Hence, these Rules.<br/> <br/>For illuminating the facts of these writ petitions stated hereinbefore and also of the discussions, observations and orders to be made/passed in these cases hereinafter and, further, for the ease of reference, let the respondents’ identities be known. In all the writ petitions respondent no. 1 is the Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Public Works, respondent no. 2 is the Director, Directorate of Government Accommodation, respondent no. 3 is the Secretary, Ministry of Industry, respondent no. 4 is the Secretary, Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs and respondent no. 5 is the Secretary, Ministry of Finance. All of them entered appearances by filing affidavits-in-opposition.<br/> <br/>The affidavit-in-opposition filed on behalf of respondent nos. 1 and 2 contends, <em>inter-alia</em>, that there are, in total, 124 superior type of houses (bungalows) and out of them 20 houses have been earmarked for the Judges of the Supreme Court and the Registrar of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh is in charge of allocation of all the said 20 houses and, currently, all these earmarked houses are being occupied by the Hon’ble Judges of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. It is stated that normally no bungalow type house, except the aforesaid 20 earmarked houses, is allotted to the Judges of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh by respondent no. 2. However, on special consideration, in addition to the said 20 earmarked houses, 27 extra superior types of Government houses have been allotted to the Judges of the Supreme Court and, thus, presently total 47 superior type of houses, being situated at Minto Road, Bailey Road, Dhanmondi Residential Area, Mohammadpur Residential Area and Gulshan Residential Area, are being occupied by the Judges of the Supreme Court. It is stated that the Government has undertaken a project at 67, Circuit House Road, Ramna, Dhaka for construction of 76 apartm-ents of 4200 Square feet for the Judges of the Supreme Court and the construction of the same is going on at full speed.<br/><br/>It is stated that most of the bungalow type houses at Minto Road, Bailey Road and Hare Road are earmarked for the Ministers, State Ministers, Deputy Ministers, Commissioners of Election Commission, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Auditor and Comptroller General of Bangladesh, Governor of Bangladesh Bank, District Judge, DC, SP of the Dhaka District and some other special designated officers. It is stated that as per the Bangladesh Government Allocation Rules, 1982 Government Officers with the scale of Tk. 32,300/- and above, ranking from Joint Secretary to Senior Secretary, are entitled to get allotment of the superior type of houses and, at present, there are 6 (Six) earmarked buildings for the said officers having 195 superior type of flats of above 4000 square feet. Nevertheless, there is an acute shortage of accommodations of the high-ranking Government servants and in order to cope up with the situation a good number of bungalow houses at Minto Road and Bailey Road and 9 (nine) bungalow type of houses outside the said areas have been allotted in favour of the Government servants with the rank of Secretary, Senior Secretary and Cabinet Secretary. It is stated that House No. 12 at Minto Road, Dhaka is a bungalow type house and the said house has been allotted to respondent no. 3 on 20.11.2012 upon his application dated 25.10.2012 and handed over to him on 15.05.2013. It is stated that Mr. Justice Md. Jahangir Hossain made his application to the Hon’ble President of the Republic for allocation of the said house on 08.11.2011 and the same, being recommended by the august office of the Hon’ble President of Bangladesh on 10.11.2012, was received only on 20.11.2012 and 21.11.2012 by respondent nos. 1 and 2 respectively and, thus, it could not be allotted to the Hon’ble Mr. Justice Md. Jahangir Hossain as the said house, by then, was allotted to respondent no. 3 on 20.11.2012. It is stated that Mr. Justice Md. Jahangir Hossain has been living in a superior type of house at House no. 71/1, Circuit House upon getting it allotted on 02.01.2012.<br/><br/>By filing a separate affidavit-in-opposi-tion respondent no. 3 contends, inter-alia, that currently he is living in a superior type house in Gulshan area allotted by the Government but his office being in Motijheel area, he was encountering severe traffic jam everyday on the way to and from his office and, under the situation, he applied for House no. 20 at Minto Road, Dhaka on 20.11.2012 and the same was handed over to him on 15.05.2013.<br/> <br/>By filing another affidavit-in-opposition respondent no. 5 contends, inter-alia, that as per the Supreme Court Judges (Remuneration and Privileges)(Amended) Act, 2010 at present the Hon’ble Judges of the Supreme Court gets Tk.26,600/- per month as their residence allowance. It is stated that previously the residence allowance was Tk. 20,000/-and recently the “Committee on Pay and Privilege of the Judges of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh” has been formed by the Government to place recomm-endation regarding revised remuneration of the Judges of the Supreme Court and the said Committee recommended for free furnished residence with all other facilities and a monthly payment of Tk. 35,000/- as residence allowance, in the event of its non-availability. It is stated that the Finance Division will do the needful to increase the amount of the residence allowance, if any such proposal is made by the Ministry of Law and Parliament.<br/><br/>Mr. A.M. Aminuddin, Mr. S.M. Rezaul Karim, Mr. B.M. Elias and Mr. Aneek R. Haque, all of the learned advocates appeared for the petitioners. They, at the very outset, submit in one voice that the petitioners are the conscious citizens of the country and are committed to the welfare of the Republic and to uphold the Rule of Law and our society expects that the lawyers, such as the petitioners, should always be vigilant against any action of the state taken to the disadvantage of the judiciary and, thus, all these Public Interest Litigations (PIL) are being moved in the interest of the public at large as <em>pro-bono publico</em>.<br/> <br/>They submit that the statements/ discus-sions by those holding high office and wielding state power, the elite class or the members of the civil society in different seminars and in the electronic/print media as to the establishment of rule of law in the country would be regarded by the common men to be a farce, if, at first, an environment for the judiciary to work indep-endently is not created. They submit that members of the judiciary must be allowed to work uninterruptedly being free from any anxiety about maintaining their personal and family life. They submit that if the Judges of the Supreme Court are to be dependent on the kindness of the members of the executive branch for their various legal entitlements such as, here in this case, allocation of houses, they will not be in a position to demonstrate their impartiality at the time of adjudication upon a case against the concerned authority of the government. They submit that if the Judges of the higher judiciary is to be engaged in satisfying the members of the executives, the judiciary as an organ of the state shall never be independent.<br/> <br/>Then, they placed Section 4(1)(a) of the Supreme Court Judges (Remuneration and Privileges) Ordinance, 1978 (hereinafter referred to as the Ordinance, 1978)  and submit that it is a mandatory duty of respondent nos. 1 and 2 to arrange for furnished residences with free electricity, gas, water and other facilities, which may either be bungalow type houses or flats in view of the words <em>“provided with”</em> employed in the said Section in furtherance to the words <em>“shall be entitled to”</em>. They submit that by using the phraseology <em>“a judge shall be entitled to, and provided with”,</em> the legislature intended to ensure that all the Judges of the Supreme Court must be provided with a suitable accommodation just after entering into their office.<br/> <br/>Then, they refer to the amount of money figured in the second part of Section 4(1)(a) of the Ordinance, 1978 which makes the provisions for monthly payment of Tk. 26,600/- in the event of the failure by the Government for arranging furnished houses for the Judges of the Supreme Court and term the said figure to be completely impractical and unreasonable as well as inconsistent with the provisions as prescribed in the same Section of the said Ordinance as to providing furnished residence for the Judges. They submit that the amount of money spent for providing a Judge with a furnished residence, together with the rent, charge and bills of electricity, water and gas does cost the Government nearly Taka 2, 00000/- (two lacs) per month and, on the other hand, only Tk. 26,600/- is being paid to the Judges living in privately rented accommo-dation. They submit that anyone with minimum prudence will get bewildered at the comparison of the above figures. They, therefore, submit that the provisions made in the Ordinance, 1978 for payment of Tk. 26, 600/- is violative of Articles 27 and 29 of the Constitution inasmuch as all the Judges of the Supreme Court being at par, some of them cannot be subjected to discrimination by the respondents by purposely not providing a furnished residence. They, thus, submit that the said provision is required to be declared ultra vires the Constitution.<br/> <br/>The learned advocates, by sketching out a comparative rent schedule of the different areas of the Dhaka City, submit that most of the Judges of the Supreme Court, who are yet to get Government accommodation, are living in the privately rented houses of 4 to 5 bed rooms and they are monthly spending for their house rent Tk. 40,000/- to Tk.70,000/-, based on the area/location and size of the flat and, in addition to that, they are paying Tk. 10,000/- to Tk. 20,000/- per month as service charges and for bills of electricity, water and gas and, therefore, the learned advocates for the petitioners assailed the second part of Section 4(1)(a) of the Ordinance, 1978 to be repugnant to the provisions of the first part of the said Section on the ground of lacking any basis in fixation of Taka 26,600/00. They submit that incorporation of the said part in Section 4(1)(a) of the Ordinance, 1978 has created scope for the respondents to act arbitrarily in allocation of accommodations for the Hon’ble Judges and, thereby, deprive them of getting their residence and, as such, the said part is an unreasonable legislation and requires to be deleted from the said Section 4(1)(a) and an alternative provisions should be incorporated therein to defuse the respondents’ tendency of being actuated by their whims, arbitrariness and malice in fixation of the amount of money as the residence allowance for the Judges of the Supreme Court in case of non-availability of the Government accommodation.<br/> <br/>They submit that it is the foremost responsibility of the State to ensure the hassle-free enjoyment of the privileges of the Judges as prescribed in the Supreme Court Judges (Remuneration and Privileges) Ordinance, 1978 as the Judges are entitled to get protection of Article 31 of the Constitution which guarantees that everyone will be treated in accordance with law. They refer to annexures X &amp; X(1) series appended to the affidavit-in-compliance where superior types of flats and bungalow houses have been listed. They assail the said list to be incorrect as the petitioners have come to know that there are some more superior type of accommodations presently lying vacant but the respondents do not intend to allot the same to the Judges and, thence, those have not been shown in the aforesaid 2 (two) lists. In this context, they refer to the statements made in Writ Petition no. 5276 of 2013 where, at the investigation of the petitioners, the House no. 8/15 at Sir Syed Ahmed Road has been surfaced to be vacant. They also referred to another news clipping which reports that a house in Dhanmondi area, for which the Government is litigating for years to dispossess the alleged owners, has been allotted to an Hon’ble Judge of the Supreme Court with an ulterior motive of maligning the image of the judges of the higher judiciary. They, then, refer to a number of decisions of our Apex Court where an Article or a part of the Constitution or a piece of legislation was struck down for being repugnant to the other provisions of the same statute or for being ultra vires the Constitution.<br/> <br/>They referred to Section 2(a) of Bangladesh Allocation Rules, 1982 and submit that when it does not become possible for the Government to make arrangement of accom-modation for the Government servants from the houses/flats owned by the Government, it hires or requisitions houses/flats for the Government servants for mitigating the demands and, thus, by drawing an analogy from the said provisions of the Bangladesh Allocation Rules, 1982 the learned advocates for the petitioners submit that the respondents ought to have hired or requisitioned the required number of houses or flats of 4,200 square feet for the Judges of the Supreme Court until the project of construction of 76 flats of 4200 square feet at 67, Circuit House Road, Ramna, Dhaka is completed inasmuch as it is the imperative for the respondents to provide accommodation. They, in the manner of placing a suggestion to the respondents through this Court, submit that the location of the hired or requisitioned flats should be within the proximity of the Supreme Court premises, such as Eskaton, Siddheshwari, Kakrail and Bailey Road areas and, in the case of non-availability of the required number of houses/flats in the said area, secured residential areas like, Dhanmondi, Gulshan and Banani should be selected. They put a further suggestion that the hired or requisitioned flat should not be of less than 4,200 square feet as they submit that the said residence for the Judges of the Supreme Court should have sufficient space with an internal arrangement of a study room, in addition to having at least 4 bed rooms, one dining room and one guest room. In a bid to compare the residential arrangements of the Judges of the Supreme Court with that of the members of the executive, they placed the fact before this Court that the flats earmarked for the Joint Secretaries to Secretaries at Eskaton, Bailey Road, Gulshan, Dhanmondi and other areas of the City are of 4,000 square feet and, further, the Ministers’ Flats situated at Minto Road earmarked for the State Ministers are of 5,200 square feet and submit that in comparison to the above facts and figures the Judges of the Supreme Court, being positioned in the Constitutional post, must deserve allotment of the flats of larger space than those of the Secretaries to the Government.<br/> <br/>Per contra Mr. Mahbubey Alam, the learned Attorney General appearing for all the respondents, submits that fixation of an amount of money as the residence allowance for the persons holding the Constitutional posts or for the Government servants is completely a policy decision and the power of making the policy decision has been vested in the legislature and in the executive and, as such, the same is not judicially reviewable. To augment the submissions, he draws our attention to the maxim “No man should be judge in his own cause (<em>Nemo debet esse judex in propria causa</em>)” and adds that since the issue is related to the self-interest of the honourable Judges of this Court, it may be fair to leave the dispute upon the policy makers for their considerations instead of adjudication upon the same by itself.<br/> <br/>He submits that the legislature in their wisdom have intended to provide furnished residence together with the rents, charges and bills for the Judges of the Supreme Court and if the said arrangement cannot be made due to the non-availability of the houses or flats, provisions have been made in the same piece of legislation for making payment of a fixed amount of money for the Judges of the Supreme Court as the residence allowance. He submits that previously the amount was Tk. 20,000/- which has, recently in 2010, been increased to Tk. 26,600/- and the Government is actively considering to increase it to Tk. 35,000/- and, as such, it will be illogical to say that the Government is not reviewing the provisions laid down in the second part of Section 4(1)(a) Ordinance, 1978.<br/> <br/>He submits that this Court is empowered to declare an Act of Parliament to be void only if it is clearly found that the same is inconsistent with any part of the Constitution and, in the case at hand, as he submits, there being no inconsistency of the provisions of second part of Section 4(1)(a) of the Ordinance, 1978 with any Article of the Constitution, there is no ground for declaring the same to be ultra vires the Constitution.<br/> <br/>He, by referring to the news clippings centering house no. 12 at Minto Road, Dhaka, submits that the adjudication upon these types of disputes by this Court may give rise to an unwanted unhappiness among the members of the executives and, thereby, may create an unhealthy working environment with the higher judiciary. He refers to Rules 3, 4 and 8 of the Bangladesh Allocation Rules, 1982 and submits that only the Government Servants are entitled to the superior type of houses and the Government has the power to reserve the required number of accommodations in order to allot the same to the holders of specific posts and the Judges of the Supreme Court being not in the service of the Republic cannot claim the houses/flats managed and controlled by respondent nos. 1 and 2. He submits that the Judges of the Supreme Court, being the Constitutional post holders, should be provided with accommodation at a specified place where only the Judges exclusively may live with their families and, keeping this view in mind, the Government previously has constructed 20 independent bungalow type houses within the vicinity at Kakrail and in view of the increasing appointments in the higher judiciary the Government has already undertaken a project to construct a building with 76 flats of 4,200 square feet each and the project is due to be completed in the next couple of years and, after completion of the said project, it is expected that there will be no shortage of accomm-odation for the Judges of the Supreme Court.<br/> <br/>The learned Attorney General endeavors to indicate that the present writ petitions are aimed at making a particular Judge of the Supreme Court, who was trying to get allotment of a bungalow type house in Minto Road area, happy and submits that this sort of phenomenon should be discouraged by this Court as it may lead to bridging up an unsolicited rapport of the petitioners with the said Judge. He submits that the House in question should not be allotted to the said Hon’ble Judge in the light of the fact that he might feel indebted towards the petitioners for their co-operation in encountering the concerned members of the Executive branch, if the said house is allotted to him consequent to the verdict of these writ petitions. He does not concede to the claim of the petitioners that the instant writ petitions are directed bona fide and aiming at vindication of a public concern and, thus, submits that the petitioners do not have any <em>locus standi</em> to file the instant applications under Article 102 of the Constitution.<br/> <br/>We have heard the submissions advanced by the learned advocates for the petitioners and the learned Attorney General at length and perused the writ petitions, affidavits-in-opposition and the annexures appended thereto. We have also looked at the relevant provisions of the law and gone through the decisions placed before us and considered them with great care.<br/> <br/>Since the learned Attorney General for Bangladesh has raised the question of maintainability of these writ petitions on the ground of the standing of the petitioners as well as the competency  of this Court in adjudic-ation upon the matter, for being the same related with the self-interest of the Judges of this Court, this Court is required to deal with the said issues at first before entering into the task of examining the constitutionality of the impugned part of Section 4(1) (a) of the Supreme Court Judges (Remuneration and Privileges) Ordinance, 1978 as well as the impugned actions of the respondents.<br/> <br/>In order to carry out the said examin-ation, we should look at the wordings of Article 102 of our Constitution in tandem with the decisions of our jurisdiction and foreign jurisdictions. <br/>Since we are a new born nation and have been bestowed with our Constitution only since 42 years, let us first look at the old jurisdiction, such as UK, India and Pakistan, for the interpretation made and hold on the point of standing of a petitioner in judicial review cases by their Constitutional Courts.<br/> <br/>In India, the concept of public interest litigation was imported by Mr. VR Krishna lyer, J in the case of <em>Mumbai Kamgar Sabha, Bombay vs Ms Abdul Bhai reported in AIR 1976 (SC) 1466</em> and, eventually, in the celebrated case of <em>SP Gupta vs President of India reported in AIR 1982 (SC) 149</em> (known as Judges case) the jurisprudential basis was laid down. In that case several advocates of different Bars challenged the Government’s action transferring some Judges of the High Courts and Justice Bhagwati approved the <em>locus standi</em> in paragraph 17.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“Where a legal wrong or a legal injury is caused to a person or to a determinate class of persons by reason of violation of any constitutional or legal right or any burden is imposed in contravention of any constitutional or legal provision or without authority of law or any such legal wrong or legal injury or illegal burden is threatened and such person or determinate class of persons is, by reason of poverty, helplessness or disability or socially or economically disadvantaged position, unable to approach the Court for relief, any member of the public maintain an application....... seeking judicial redress for the legal wrong or injury caused to such person or determinate class of persons”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In Indian jurisdiction the <em>locus standi</em> has been enlarged to such an extent that now it is left completely upon the discretion of the Courts on the basis of the fact of the each case. In the cases of  <em>BALCO Employees Union (Regd) V. Union of India, 2001 AIR SCW 5135</em>, <em>S.P. Gupta V. Union of India, 1981 (Supp) SCC 87</em>, <em>Janata Dal V. H.S. Chowdhury, (1992) 4 SCC 305</em> and in many other latest cases, the standing of a petitioner was accorded giving liberal meaning of the “person aggrieved”.<br/> <br/>In Pakistan, in the year of 1956, in the case of <em>Tariq Transport Company, Lahore vs Sargodha-Bhera Bus Service, Sargodha </em>reported in 11 DLR (SC) 140, the Supreme Court of Pakistan observed.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“........ a person seeking judicial review must show that he has a direct personal interest in the act which he challenges before his prayer for review is entertained.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of <em>Mian Fazal Din vs Lahore Improvement Trust</em> reported in 21 DLR (SC) 225, the Pakistan Supreme Court took somewhat liberal view stating—<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“........the right considered sufficient for maintaining a proceeding of this nature is not necessarily a right in the strict juristic sense; but it is enough if the applicant disclose that he had a personal interest in the performance of the legal duty, which if not performed or performed in a manner not permitted by law, would result in the loss of some personal benefit or advantage or the curtailment or the curtailment of a privilege or liberty or franchise.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>However, the development in this field took place in Pakistan only in the recent past. In the case of <em>Benazir Bhutto vs Federation of Pakistan, PLD 1988 (SC) 416</em>, the Pakistan Supreme Court held that as the provision of Article 184(3) is open-ended, the proceedings could be maintained by an individual whose fundamental rights are infracted or by a person bona fide alleging infraction of the fundamental rights of a class or a group of persons, as there is no rigid incorporation of the notion of ‘aggrieved party’ in Article 184(3).<br/> <br/>In England, no written Constitutional or any statutory provision as to the <em>locus-standi</em> of a petitioner to file judicial review application, like the words “any person aggrieved” as used in our Constitution, was in existence before 1981. The English Courts have, <em>de facto</em>   made the legislation as to the <em>locus-standi</em>. In the English jurisdiction, the leading English case on <em>locus standi</em> is <em>ex parte Sidebotham, (1880) 14 Ch D 458</em> where the Court held that a person aggrieved is a man “<em>who has suffered a legal grievance, a man against whom a decision has been pronounced which has wrongly deprived him of something, or wrongfully refused him something, or wrongfully affected his title to something.</em>”<br/> <br/>After the said judgment, there have been significant developments in the English jurisdiction as to the rule of <em>locus standi </em>and shifted from restrictive view of standing.<br/> <br/>In the case of <em>RV Metropolitan Police Commissioner ex P Blackburn [1968] 1 All ER 763</em> and, subsequently, in the case of <em>P Blackburn vs Attorney-General [1971] 2 all ER 1380 and, then, </em>in the case of <em>RV Metropolitan Police Commissioner ex P Blackburn [1973] All ER 324</em> the petitioners were accorded standing as the Courts found that the petitioners had ‘sufficient interest’ in the performance of the public duty.<br/> <br/>Thereafter, by the enactment of the Supreme Court Act, 1981 the issue has finally been settled. <br/>To return to our jurisdiction, the observations made by our Appellate Division in the case of  <em>Bangladesh Sangbadpatra Parishad Vs Bangladesh</em> reported in 43 DLR(AD) 126 (para 9), having compared the standing of a petitioner in the context of our Constitution to that of UK and India, may be quoted which is as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“In our Constitution the petitioner seeking enforcement of a fundamental right or constitutional remedies must be a “person aggrieved”. Our Constitution is not at pari materia with the Indian Constitution on this point. The Indian Constitution, either in Article 32 or in Article 226, has not mentioned who can apply for enforcement of fundamental rights and constitutional remedies. The Indian Courts only honoured a tradition in requiring that the petitioner must be an “aggrieved person”. The emergence in Indian of pro bono  publico litigation, that is litigation at the instance of a public-spirited citizen espousing causes of others, has been facilitated by the absence of any constitutional provision as to who can apply for a writ. In England, various tests were applied. Sometimes it was said that a person must be “aggrieved” or he must have “a specific legal right” of or, he must have a “sufficient interest”. Now, after the introduction of the new Rules of the Supreme Court, Order 53 Rule 3, any person can apply for “judicial review” in England under the Supreme Court Act, 1981 if he has a “sufficient interest”.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Let us first look at Article 102 of our Constitution, the repository power of this Court to review the actions of any person, reads as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“</em>Powers of High Court Division to issue certain orders and directions, etc. (1) The High Court Division on the application of <u>any person aggrieved</u>, may give such directions or orders to any person or authority, including any person performing any function in connection with the affairs of the Republic, as may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III of this Constitution.<br/>(2) the High Court Division may, if satisfied that no other equally efficacious remedy is provided by law-<br/>(a) on the application of any <u>person aggrieved</u>, make an order- (underlined by us)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Under Article 102(1) of our Constitution, our Court exercises the power of judicial review if an impugned action is made in violation of fundamental rights on the application of “any aggrieved person”. Under Article 102(2), in order to have locus standi to invoke the jurisdiction, an applicant has to show that he is an aggrieved party in an application for certiorari, mandamus or prohibition but not in an application for habeas corpus or quo warranto, where Writ Petitioner is not required to be a ‘person aggrieved’.<br/> <br/>In our jurisdiction the question of <em>locus standi</em> of the petitioners was examined for the first time in the <em>Beru Bari</em> Case reported in 26 DLR (SC) 44. In the aforesaid case their Lordships of the Supreme Court held as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“We have given the respondents’ objection as to the Appellants’ locus standi to move the High Court Division our anxious consideration. It appears to us that the question of locus standi does not involve the Court’s jurisdiction to hear a person but of the competency of the person to claim a hearing, so that the question is one of discretion which the Court exercises upon due consideration of the facts and circum-stances of each case. The appellant has complained that he is under impending threat of deprivation of his fundam-ental rights under Article 36 of the Constitution and his right of franchise. Because of this as well as of the excep-tional and extra-ordinary Constitutional issues raised in this case involving consideration of an international agre-ement between this country and the friendly Republic of India, we decided to hear the appellant.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In <em>Dr. Mohiuddin Farooque Vs. Bangladesh</em>, 49 DLR (AD) 1, (popularly known as BELA’s case) Mr. B.B. Roy Chowdhury, J, observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“<em>In such harrowing conditions of our people in general if socially conscious and public-spirited persons are not allowed to approach the court on behalf of the public or a section thereof for the enforcement of their rights the very scheme of the Constitution will be frustrated. The inescapable conclusion, therefore, is that the expression “person aggrieved” means not only any person who is personally aggrieved but also one whose heart bleeds for his less fortunate fellow beings for a wrong done by the Government or a local authority in not fulfilling its constitut-ional or statutory obligation. It does not, however, extend to a person who is an interloper and interferes with things which do not concern him. This approach is in keeping with the constitutional principles that are being evolved in the recent times in different countries”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the said <em>BELA’s case</em>, his Lordship Mr. Justice Mostafa Kamal of the Appellate Division held in paragraph 40:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“We now proceed to say we interpret Article 102 as a whole. We do not give much importance to the dictionary meaning or punctuation of the words ‘any person aggrieved.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It was further held in <em>BELA’s case</em> in paragraph 47:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“The Supreme Court being a vehicle, a medium or mechanism devised by the Constitution for the exercise of the judicial power of the people on behalf of the people, the people will always remain the focal point of concern of the Supreme Court while dispensing justice or propounding any judicial theory or interpreting any provision of the Constitution. Viewed in this context, interpreting the words “any person aggrieved” meaning only and exclusively individuals and excluding the consider-ation of people as a collective and consolidated personality will be a stand taken against the Constitution. There is no question of enlarging locus standi or legislation by Court.  The enlargement is writ large on the face of the Constitution.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Ultimately Mr. Justice Mostafa Kamal held in the same case in paragraph 48:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“The traditional view remains true, valid and effective till today in so far as individual rights and individual infraction thereof are concerned. But when a public injury or public wrong or infraction of a fundamental right affecting an indeterminate number of people is involved, it is not necessary, in the scheme of our Constitution, that the multitude of individuals who have been collectively wronged or injured or whose collective fundamental rights have been invaded are to invoke the jurisdiction under Article 102 in multitude of individual writ petitions, each representing his own portion of concern. In so far as it concerns public wrong or public injury or invasion of fundamental rights of an indeterminate number of people, any member of the public, being a citizen, suffering the common injury or common invasion in common with others or any citizen or an indigenous association, as distinguished from a local component of a foreign organization, espousing that particular cause is a person aggrieved and has the right to invoke the jurisdiction under Article 102.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of <em>Ekushey Television Ltd. vs Dr. Chowdhury Mahmood Hasan </em>reported in 54 DLR (AD) 130 (popularly known as ETV case), it was held in paragraph 48:   <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“What is meant by ‘sufficient interest’ is basically a question of fact and law which shall have to be decided by the Court. None of the fundamental rights like rule of law is subject to mechanical measurement. They are measured by our human institutions i.e. the Courts and by human beings i.e. the Judges, by applying law. Therefore, there will always be an element of discretion to be used by the Court in giving standing to the petitioner. From the above, it appears that the Courts of this jurisdiction have shifted their position to a great extent from the traditional rule of standing which confines access to the judicial process only to those to whom legal injuries are caused or legal wrong is done. The narrow confines within which the rule of standing was imprisoned for long years have been broken and a new dimension is being given to the doctrine of locus standi.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the Case of <em>Bangladesh and others Vs Idrisur Rahman</em> (10 Judges Case) reported in 17 BLT (AD) 231 the petitioner, Mr. Idrisur Rahman, was an advocate and the subject matter of the writ petition was reinstatement of some High Court Judges under Article 95 of the Constitution. Thus, though the petitioner was not found to be personally aggrieved but his standing was accorded on the ground that the petitioner, as a lawyer, has an intensive interest in the establishment of the independence of the Judiciary. <br/> <br/>In the case of <em>Bangladesh Vs Advocate AKM Shafiuddin </em>1 LCLR [2012] HCD339 (which has subsequently been disposed of by the Appellate Division in CP No.2212 of 2012), the petitioner, who is a lawyer of this Court, challenged the proceedings of the Parliament where a derogatory remark was made about an Hon’ble Judge of this Court and, further, a “Ruling” was passed by the Parliament demoralising the position and jurisdiction of this Court. In adjudication upon the said case, the competency of the petitioner in filing the writ petition was not viewed by this Court negatively.<br/> <br/>In the case of <em>Advocate Manzil Morshed and others</em> vs <em>Government of Bangladesh and others </em>(Writ Petition No. 2427 of 2011) the petitioners’ standing was not questioned albeit the subject matter of the case was related to the Supreme Court Judges’ remuneration (the matter being appealed by the Government as CPLA No. 1775 of 2013 is awaiting disposal by our Appellate Division).<br/> <br/>In all the above <em>Stare Decisis</em> (Starred Decisions), the standing of the petitioner was approved by our Courts.<br/> <br/>However, in the case of <em>Bangladesh Sangbadpatra Parishad Vs Bangladesh</em> reported in 43 DLR(AD) 126, the locus standi of the petitioner was denied. Later on, A.T.M. Afzal, J. in <em>Dr. Mohiuddin Farooque Vs Bangladesh,</em> 49 DLR (AD) 1, in according locus standi to the petitioner, laid down some principles to be observed by our High Court Division:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“A person pleading sufficient interest may be able to cross, what is called, the threshold stage on the averments made in the writ petition but it will always remain open for a prospective respondent to contest the said claim on facts and also to assail the bonafides on even the appropriateness in a particular case of the petitioner for seeking a relief invoking the constitut-ional jurisdiction of the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution. For example, standing was denied to the Bangladesh Sangbad Patra Parishad to represent its opulent members, namely, the newspaper owners who were directly affected by the Wage Board Award but even then none of them moved personally, but the consideration would have been different if any organization representing a weaker section of the society had come to complain about a breach of any fundamental right of its members or any public wrong done to the members generally in breach of any provision of the Constitution or law. The Court will have to decide in each case, particularly when objections is taken, not only the extent of sufficiency of interest but also the fitness of the person for invoking the discretionary jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution. Ordinarily, it is the affected party which is to come to the Court for remedy. The Court in considering the question of standing in a particular case, if the affected party is not before it, will enquire as to why the affected party is not coming before it and if it finds no satisfactory reason for non-appearance of the affected party, it may refuse to entertain the application.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the Case of <em>BRAC Vs Professor Mozaffar Ahmed</em> reported in 54 DLR (AD) 37 (popularly known as BRAC Bank Case) our Apex Court did not approve the standing of Professor Mozaffar Ahmed in availing the jurisdiction of this Court as the Court did not find any element of Public Interest in the case and also the petitioner was not found personally aggrieved due to not having his connection with any existing bank.<br/> <br/>Thereafter, in a recent case of <em>National Board of Revenue Vs Abu Sayeed Khan and others </em>reported in 18 BLC (AD) (2013) 116, our Appellate Division, after reviewing the views taken in the above cited series of decisions, has directed the High Court to be vigilant in entertaining the PIL cases in the following words:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“Now-a-days, it is noticeable that a group of lawyers have developed a tendency of filing PIL petitions on behalf of persons or organizations challenging the propriety of the Government in taking decision relating to policy matter, its development works, orders of promotion and transfer of public servants, imposition of taxes and fixation of tariff value by the authority for achieving dubious goal for generating publicity for themselves or to create public sensation. The High Court Division has been taking cognizance of those petitions without looking at whether or not such petitions are at all maintainable in the light of the principles settled by this Division in Mohiuddin Farooque, Professor Mozaffor Ahmed and Ms. Syeda Rizwana Hasan. It is also noticeable that after seeking an order from the High Court Division by filing a PIL, the lawyers are appearing before the electronic and print media propagating that the Court has made such and such directions, which suggest that those petitions have not been made for the cause of the needy or underprivileged or less fortunate people, who could not seek redress for a wrong done by the Government or a local authority, rather it were moved for achieving dubious goal for generating personal publicity.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Then, in the said case, our Apex Court took the pain of formulating guidelines for the High Court Division which is as under:<br/> <br/>“We reemphasize the parameters within which the High Court Division should extend its discretionary jurisdiction in entertaining a PIL.<br/> </div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Before entertaining a petition the Court will have to decide the extent of sufficiency of interest and the fitness of the person invoking the discretionary jurisdiction. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>The Court while considering the question of bonafide in a particular case will have to decide as to why the affected party has not come before it and if it finds no satisfactory reason for non-appearance of such affected party, it may refuse to entertain the petition. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>if a petition is filed to represent opulent</em><em> members who were directly affected by the decision of the Government or Public Authority, such petition would not be entertained. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>The expression ‘person aggrieved’ used in Article 102(1) means not any person who is personally aggrieved but one whose heart bleeds for the less fortunate fellow beings for a wrong done by any person or authority in connection with the affairs of the Republic or a Statutory Public Authority. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>If the person making the application on enquiry is found to be an interloper who interferes with the action of any person or authority as above which does not concern him is not entitled to make such petition. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>The Court is under an obligation to guard that the filing of a PIL does not convert into a publicity interest litigation or private interest litigation. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Only a public spirited person or organ-ization can invoke the discretionary jurisdiction of the Court on behalf of such disadvantaged and, helpless person. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>The Court should also guard that its processes are not abused by any person. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>The Court should also guard that the petition is initiated for the benefit of the poor or for any number of people who have been suffering from common injury but their grievances cannot be redressed as they are not able to reach the Court. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>  It must also be guarded that every wrong or curiosity is not and cannot be the subject matter of PIL.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>  No petitions will be entertained challenging the policy matter of the Government, development works being implemented by the Government, Orders of promotion or transfer of public servants, imposition of taxes by the competent authority.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em> The Court has no power to entertain a petition which trespasses into the areas which are reserved to the executive and legislative by the Constitution. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em> A petition will be entertained if it is moved to protect basic human rights of the disadvantaged citizens who are unable to reach the Court due to illiteracy or monetary helplessness. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Apart from the above, the following are some categories of cases which will be entertained:</em></li></ol><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>for protection of the neglected children. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>non-payment of minimum wages to workers and exploitation of casual workers and complaints of violation of labour laws (except in individual case).</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>petitions complaining death in jail or police custody, or caused by law enforcing agencies. </em></li><li style="text-align:

style="text-align: justify;"><em>petitions against atrocities on women such as, bride burning, rape, murder for dowry, kidnapping. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>petitions complaining harassment or torture of citizens by police or other law enforcing agencies. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>petitions pertaining to environmental pollution, disturbance of ecological balance, drugs, food adulteration, maintenance of heritage and culture, antiques, forest and wild life. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>petitions from riot victims</em>”.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Now, let us vet the competency of the present petitioners in the light of the provisions of our Constitution, other laws and the decisions of the Apex Court of our and foreign jurisdictions discussed hereinbefore.<br/> <br/>It is evident that the petitioners are the practising advocates of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh and the subject matter of these applications is not related to their personal issues, rather it is related to the interest of the Judges of the Supreme Court and, that being the scenario, we are to examine how they are aggrieved by the incorporation of the impugned provision of Section 4(1)(a) of the said Ordinance, 1978 and by the impugned actions of the respondents. It is the contentions of the petitioners that they are public spirited advocates and have come forward to remedy the injury caused to the administration of justice when they noticed that Judges of this Court are attempted to be maligned with a likely consequence of weakening the position of the judiciary. We find substance in the said contentions in that a lawyer has a vital interest in the independence of the judiciary as the legal profession is an integral part of the judicial system and, further, a lawyer is an Officer of the Court who sits and practises in the Court and, therefore, he has a legitimate interest in preserving the integrity of independence of the judicial system and if the integrity and interest of the judiciary is threatened by an act of a state functionary, naturally, it shakes the conscience of a lawyer.<br/> <br/>When there appears some scheme and a design to demoralize Judges of the highest Court, lawyers feel perturbed as they are always serious in maintaining the high standards of fearless, impartial and unbending justice. One may be able to live in a world of logic detachment when unjustified abuses are hurled at one’s self personally, but when the question is of injury to an institution, such as the highest Court of justice in the land, one cannot overlook its effect upon national honour and prestige. It becomes a matter deserving consideration of all serious minded people who are interested in seeing that democracy does not flounder or pale in this country.  <br/> <br/>In this connection it may be mentioned that in the celebrated judgment of the case of SP Gupta Vs. Union of India, AIR 1982(S.C) 149, (popularly known as Judges’ case, which is a 524-page judgment), it was observed by their Lordships that the profession of lawyers is an essential and integral part of judicial system and the lawyers may figuratively be described as priests in the temple of justice. They have special interest in preserving the integrity and independence of the judicial system, and if the integrity and independence of judiciary is threatened by any act of State or any public authority, they would naturally be concerned about it because they are equal partners with the Judges.<br/> <br/>In our jurisdiction, in the land mark cases of <em>the Secretary, Ministry of Finance Vs. Masdar Hossain and others</em> reported in 52 DLR (AD) 82, <em>Bangladesh and others Vs Md. Idrisur Rahman</em> reported in 17 BLT (AD) 231 (popularly known as 10 Judges Case) <em>Bangladesh Vs Advocate AKM Shafiuddin</em> reported in 64 DLR 508 (which has subsequently been disposed of by the Appellate Division through the CP No.2212 of 2012), <em>Government of Bangladesh Vs Advocate Manzil Morshed</em> (CP No. 1172 of 2012, case relating to the medical allowances of the Judges of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh)  and <em>Advocate Manzil Murshid Vs Bangladesh and others 33 BLD (HCD) 121</em> (case on the increase of the remuneration of the Supreme Court Judges where Rule having been made absolute, CP No. 1775 of 2013 is awaiting final disposal), <em>Advocate Manzil Morshed V Government of Bangladesh and other (Writ Petition No. 100027 of 2011</em>, where the circular of the Biman Bangladesh Airlines was challenged to be discriminatory on the ground of non-incorporation of the provisions for the judges to upgrade their tickets like other dignitaries below the Judges), the members of the judiciary i.e. the advocates and the judicial Officers were the petitioners who have been held to be competent to approach this Court in the event when an injurious action to the judiciary was taken by the state functionaries.<br/> <br/>In <em>Kamini Kumar Datta Memorial Lectures</em> (supra, pages v, vi) Mostafa Kamal, J said<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“<em>C</em><em>onstitutional development is no doubt an evolution of the Constitution through judicial decisions, but judicial decisions on the Constitution are the outcome of dedicated lawyering backed by intensive academic studies. The role of the Judges is no doubt important, but it is the <u>practising lawyers</u> who open the multiple keys to the Constitution and show to the Judges the wealth contained in it. A responsive Judge picks up the wealth thus exposed, although there have been and are Judges in all jurisdictions who need no keys. The wealth of the Constitution is stored in their wisdom. The lawyer has to know to pick it up bits and pieces</em>”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>On top of getting support from the above landmark case laws and lexis of the jurists on the <em>locus standi</em> of the advocates of our country in PIL Cases in approaching this Court in the interest of the judiciary, “The Bangladesh Bar Council Canons of Professional Conduct and Etiquette” encourages the lawyers to take a standing in the establishment of social justice, which declares that <em>“And whereas by their efforts Advocates are expected to contribute significantly towards the creation and maintenance of conditions in which a government established by law can function fruitfully so as to ensure the realization of political, economic and social justice by all citizens”</em>(Fourth Paragraph of the Preamble).<br/> <br/>Also Paragraph 1 of Chapter III of the said legal instrument prescribes the duty of a lawyer to the Court in the following words <em>“It is the duty of an Advocate to maintain towards the courts a respectful attitude, not for the sake of the temporary incumbent of the judicial office, but for the maintenance of its supreme importance”.</em><br/> <br/>Thus, upon reading through the above laws of the land and careful analysis of the <em>Stare Decisis </em>(Starred Decisions) of our Apex Court, it is our plain understanding that the lawyers are considered to have their status in the judiciary as members of the judicial fraternity and, in our modern judicial system, by virtue of their active engagement in legal profession in the Court, they are considered and believed to be the inseparable part of the judiciary and, accordingly, they have been imposed with a heavy duty of protection of the interest of the judiciary.<br/>In the past as well, the members of the Bar could not turn a blind eye and shrug off their Constitutional responsibilities in the matters related to the independence of the judiciary, rather they have risen to the occasion being above all political bias joining hands with others to resist any unholy attempt to pollute and/or to ruin the highest judiciary which is the repository of the public.<br/> <br/>That being the position of the lawyers in the judiciary, we see the petitioners’ present move in seeking redress for the alleged wrong done by the respondents in the matters of allocations of the houses for the Hon’ble Judges of Supreme Court as an innate reaction inasmuch as we are satisfied that their conduct, in moving these petitions, are not for personal gain or political motivation or for any other oblique purpose. We find that it was a bona fide step of all these writ petitioners to bring to the notice of this Court that there has been a violation of laws and norms in allocation of a particular bungalow type house to a particular Judge of the High Court Division of the Supreme Court and, later on, during the course of hearing of these writ petitions, the petitioners’ further exertion with a prayer for issuance of supplementary Rule to challenge the vires of the second part of Section 4(1(a) of the Supreme Court Judges (Remuneration and Privileges) Ordinance, 1978 also demonstrate their bona fides inasmuch as we find their subsequent march as an effort to make out a fit PIL case on the ground that a handful of the Judges of the Supreme Court are persistently being victimized due to the operation of the said part of the law, hence, it is their contention that the same is liable to be declared ultra vires to Article 27 of the Constitution and a guideline should be given by this Court in the form of directions upon the respondents so that there will not be any scope for the respondents to allocate Government accommodations at their sweet will, whims and self-interest. Thus, we do not find any element of making any particular judge happy by moving the instant applications. Rather, we are satisfied that these are directed at endeavouring the establishment of the independence of the judiciary and rule of law.<br/> <br/>Furthermore, apart from being lawyers, the advocates are conscious citizens of the country. In our way of understanding the spirit of our Constitution, as mirrors in the above cited <em>Berubari’</em>s case, the <em>BELA’</em>s case, the <em>BRAC Bank</em> case, the <em>ETV</em> case and the case of <em>National Board of Revenue Vs Abu Sayeed Khan and others </em>reported in 18 BLC (AD) 116, is that any public spirited conscious citizen may, bona fide, come forward for resolution of a grievance of a public nature through the Court of law for the benefit of the public, as opposed to the personal benefit, and our inevitable conclusion is that the petitioners are ‘person aggrieved’ within the meaning of Article 102 of the Constitution. In coming to our conclusion we have taken into our consideration the cautionary principles laid down by Mr. ATM Afjal, J <em>in BELA’s case</em> 49 DLR (AD) 1 and also the guidelines given by our Apex Court in the <em>case of National Board of Revenue Vs Abu Sayeed Khan and others </em>reported in 18 BLC (AD) (2013) 116 on top of other scores of decisions of our jurisdiction and that of India, Pakistan and U.K.<br/> <br/>With regard to the issue of competency of this Court in adjudicating upon the instant cases, we may again profitably refer to the cases of <em>the Secretary, Ministry of Finance Vs. Masdar Hossain and others</em> reported in 52 DLR (AD) 82, <em>Bangladesh and others Vs Md. Idrisur Rahman</em> reported in 17 BLT (AD) 231 (popularly known as 10 Judges Case), <em>Bangladesh Vs Advocate AKM Shafiuddin </em>1 LCLR [2012] HCD 339 (which has subsequently been disposed of by the Appellate Division in CP No. 2212 of 2012), <em>Government of Bangladesh Vs Advocate Manzil Morshed</em> (CP No. 1172 of 2012, case relating to the medical allowances of the Judges of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh)  and <em>Bangladesh Vs Advocate Manzil Morshed</em> 33 BLD 121 (CP No. 1775 of 2013), <em>Advocate Manzil Morshed V Government of Bangladesh and other (Writ Petition No. 100027 of 2011)</em>. We may sum up the issue by noting that in course of dealing with the issue of standing of the present petitioners, it has been divulged and perceived that in all the cited cases the direct interests of the Judges of this Court were involved, nevertheless, the same were decided by this Court without being blamed as to getting predisposed. It is our considered view that while there is no separate forum for the adjudication of grievances related to the benefits and interests of the Judges of the Supreme Court, this Court being bestowed with the power of judicial review is not debarred to take up the present cases for its consideration. Furthermore, in a case where a judge’s criminality is required to be tried, there being no special forum consisting of non-judicial persons, we the Judges of this Court have never hesitated to award sentence, if found guilty. The maxim <em>Nemo debet esse judex in propria causa</em>, thus, hardly has the scope of application in such like cases in that the judiciary is an organ of the state and the said organ is staffed and run by human beings who may commit sin and, thereby, face trial and the outcome of the trial may be against or in favour of a single member of the judiciary or as a whole of the judiciary. Also, side by side, as a citizen of this country the judges are entitled to enjoy their lawful rights guaranteed in the Constitution and other laws of the land and if their rights are invaded by any state functionary or individual, they are entitled to have recourse to the competent Court of law.<br/> <br/>Article 31 of our Constitution guarantees that it is an inalienable right of every citizen to be treated in accordance with law and to enjoy the protection of law.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Article 31:</strong> “Right to protection of law. To enjoy the protection of law, and to be treated in accordance with law, and only in accordance with law, is the inalienable right of every citizen, wherever he may be, and of every other person for the time being within Bangladesh, and in particular no action detrimental to the life, liberty, body, reputation or property of any person shall be taken except in accordance with law<em>”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The Judges, thus, being the citizens of this country are entitled to benefit from the above Constitutional protection. Further, a Supreme Court Judge himself is an institution who can not act unscrupulously for his personal gain and, for this reason, all the citizens including the members of the executive branch are duty bound to pay homage to them.<br/> <br/>In the case of State V Abul Hossain reported in 14 BLC (HCD) 223 it has been observed that:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“Let it be known to everybody, if it is not already known, that a Judge of the Supreme Court is an upholder of the Rule of Law and is a Justice of the Peace for and of the whole of  Bangladesh. Any disrespect shown to him, constitutes disrespect towards the Supreme Court and also to the Republic itself, because the Supreme Court wields the power of the Republic.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The essence of the said maxim<em> Nemo debet esse judex in propria causa</em>, thus, is that no judge should try his own case and, further, in conducting the trial of a case where interest of other Judges, be that expressly or impliedly, are involved, the Judges should maintain impartiality. We can recall that we had indicated to the learned Attorney General, in course of making his submissions on the said issue, that this Court is not dealing with an isolated complaint regarding allocation or non-allocation of a house for a particular Judge, rather the onerous task devolved upon this Court is to examine the position of the impugned statute in line with our Constitution and other relevant laws of the land and, further, to see as to whether there is any need to frame a guideline for the executive to be observed in allocation of the superior type of houses to the dignitaries, particularly to the persons holding the Constitutional posts, as submitted by the learned advocate for the petitioners.<br/> <br/>Judges interpret the law as they find it and, thus, not as they would like to do it. They are inherently conditioned by the training that they would undertake their judicial functions with dispassionate objectivity without being influenced by personal and individual predilections. The Judges of this Court are under the legal obligation to protect, preserve and defend the Constitution and to dispense justice in accordance with law without any fear or favour, ill will or affection, be it the subject matter of adjudication involving our own interest or the interest of any near and dear one. The Judges, thus, can never act selfishly to personally benefit from the judgment or order passed by them. Rather, they act upon the dictates of their conscience which invariably leads them to act according to their oath.<br/> <br/>The law is reason unaffected by desire or free from passion as propounded by the great philosopher Aristotle.<br/> <br/>Lord Mansfield sees the duties of a Judge in the following words:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“I will not do that which my conscience tells me is wrong, upon this occasion, to gain the hurrah of thousands, or the daily praise of all the papers which come from the press: I will not avoid doing what I think is right; though it should draw on me the whole artillery of libels; all that falsehood and malice can invent, or the credulity of a deluded populace can swallow.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>John Adams said:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“Judges are deaf as an adder to the clamours of the populace” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Judge Hiller B. Zobel comments:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“Must follow their oaths and do their duty, heedless of editorials, letters, telegrams, picketers, threats, petitions, panelists and talk-shows. In this country, we do not administer justice by plebiscite.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Thus, we see the present applications to be one of our routine cases which we are dealing everyday as a Court of law without being partial to any parties to the litigations.<br/>Accordingly, we find that the present Writ Petitions are maintainable at the instance of the petitioners and we also find that this Court is competent to adjudicate upon the cases. <br/>The resolution of the above technical issues in the affirmative leads this Court to undertake the core issues of the case namely, (i) the impugned actions of the respondents in allocation of the Government accommodation to the person holding Constitutional posts and (ii) the constitutionality of the second part of Section 4(1)(a) of the Supreme Court Judges (Remuneration and Privileges) Ordinance, 1978.        <br/> <br/>Let us first take up the actions of the respondents which have allegedly been taken in violation of the laws and norms of the land. The alleged actions are (i) illegal allocation of House no. 12 at Minto Road in favour of respondent no. 3, (ii) non-compliance of the recommendations made by the Hon’ble President of the Republic, (iii) withholding of the Supreme Court Judges’ applications for residence and non-cooperation of respondent nos. 1 and 2 in allocation of the residence to the Supreme Court Judges and (iv) illegal allotments of a number of bungalow type houses in favour of Secretaries to the Government or other officials below serial no. 9 of the warrant of precedence.<br/> <br/>It is alleged by the petitioners that when Mr Justice Md Jahangir Hossain’s application for obtaining allotment of House no. 12 at Minto Road was lying before respondent nos. 1 &amp; 2, they ignored the same and volunteered to allot the said house infavour of  respondent no. 3. It is further alleged that since the said application was recommended by the Honourable President of the Republic for allocation of the said house, the respondents have committed a serious illegality by not complying with the recommendation of the highest functionary of the Republic. It appears from annnexures 1, 2 &amp; 3 that the application of Mr. Justice Md Jahangir Hossain has been shown to have been received by respondent no. 1 on 20.11.2012 though the same has been forwarded from the Office of the Honourable President on 10.11.2012, which appears to be an inordinate delay inasmuch as usually all the correspondences from the Office of the Honourable President reaches the concerned Ministries within a day or two. Even, if it was received on 20.11.2012, allocation of the house in favour of respondent no. 3 on 20.11.2012 (on the day of receiving of Mr. Justice Jahangir’s application) cannot escape from being exposed to question in the light of the fact that after receiving the letter from the Office of the President, the dispatch of the said allocation letter could well have been stopped. In any event, when a Judge of the High Court Division has asked for the same, the allocation letter should have been revoked inasmuch as a Judge of the Supreme Court holds a much higher post than that of a Secretary. Moreover, when the said application was recommended by the highest person of the Republic, the respondents had no option but to deal with the same first and comply with it but, instead, they showed the audacity of handing over of the residence to respondent no. 3 on 15.05.2013 i.e. after issuance of the instant Rules, which demonstrates the deliberate disregard to a Judge of the Supreme Court and the Honourable President of the Republic. Thus, the conducts of respondent nos. 1 &amp; 2 clearly appears to be malafide.<br/> <br/>Also, it is the allegation of the petitioners that while the applications for accommodation of a number of High Court Judges are not being dealt with for years, quick disposal of the application of respondent no. 3 on 20.11.2012, which was received only on 25.10.2012, demonstrates the arbitrariness and self-interest of respondent nos. 1 &amp; 2. Furthermore, the petitioners have unveiled the fact that while a handful High Court Judges are kept in the pipeline for suitable residences, a number of Senior Secretaries, Secretaries and Additional Secretaries of the Government are occupying bungalow type houses.<br/> <br/>Now, let us see what their duty is and what they have done. Respondent nos. 1 &amp; 2 are entrusted with the functions of constructions of Government houses and thereafter maintain and allot the same to the deserving applicants from the Constitutional post holders and Government servants. In discharging their duties, they are required to act in accordance with the laws of the land and, thus, not being actuated by their sweet will and interest. Now, let us see what the law prescribes in the matters of allocation of residence to the Constitution post holders and whether the said respondent nos. 1 and 2 have acted lawfully.<br/> <br/>Article 147(1) of the Constitution reads as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“ </em>(1) The remuneration, privileges and other terms and conditions of service of a person holding or acting in any office to which this article applies shall be determined by or under Act of Parliament<em>, ---</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In compliance to the above mandatory provisions the legislature in their wisdom have enacted the Supreme Court Judges (Remuneration and Privileges) Ordinance, 1978 and Section 4 (1) (a) of the same deals with the matters of accommodation of the Judges of the Supreme Court  which reads as under:<br/> <br/><u>A Judge shall be entitled to, and provided with </u>a furnished residence free from the payment of any rent and charges on account of municipal taxes and local rate and of the use of electricity, water and gas and until such residence is provided, a judge shall be paid a residence allowance of Taka, 26,600/- per month.<br/> <br/>Thus, it transpires that the entitlement to a furnished house of a Supreme Court Judge is a statutory right stemming from the Supreme law, the Constitution. Therefore, making allocation of an accommodation to a Supreme Court Judge is an unbreachable duty of the State.<br/> <br/>Furthermore, in the Warrant of Precedence the position of the High Court Judges is at serial no. 9 and it is worthy of mentioning here that the said Warrant of Precedence is framed and used for carrying out all sorts of functions of the State, not for ceremonial occasions only. If the provisions of the warrant of Precedence, for the arguments’ sake, is taken to be not applicable for the affairs of house allocation, nonetheless, by dint of statutory right, as enshrined in the Supreme Court Judges (Remuneration and Privileges) Ordinance, 1978, the Supreme Court Judges shall get preference over the Secretaries to the Governments.<br/> <br/>Invoking the provisions of the Note 1 of the Warrant of Precedence which provides: “<em>the order in the Warrant of Precedence is to be observed for State and ceremonial occasions as well as for all purpose of the Government</em>” and agreeing with the view taken in the case of Ataur Rahman (Md) Vs Bangladesh and others reported in 62 DLR 329 it is our considered view that the provisions of Warrant of Precedence is applicable for all the purposes including the matters of house allocation and, thus, it is the duty of the respondents to ensure that the houses are provided for dignitaries listed therein as per their serial and positions and, accordingly, when the allocation of the superior type of houses for the dignitaries positioned at serial no. 5 to 8 in the Warrant of Precedence is completed, the High Court Judges shall be entitled to the same. However, the lists of the superior type of houses (annexures-x &amp; x (1) portray an opposite scenario as these record that a good number of Secretaries to the Government have been allocated bungalow type houses. Without, first, accommodating the High Court Judges in bungalow type house or superior flats in any secured place, allotments of the same to the Government servants appear to be a bizarre action by the respondent nos. 1 &amp; 2. If the same are left over and available after all the Judges have been provided with their houses, there might have been an option for them but until a single Judge or any other Constitutional post holder is left without residence, no Government servant shall be eligible for the said bungalow type houses in that the Judges of the Supreme Court are Constitutional post holders and their remuneration and privileges are guaranteed in the Constitution but the Secretaries to the Government are Government servants and their terms and conditions of services are governed by the ordinary law and rules.<br/> <br/>Here, in the cases at hand, the respondents failed to comprehend that while the source of entitlement of the Supreme Court Judges to an accommodation is an Act of Parliament being a compliance to Article 147(1) of the Constitution, the source of entitlement to the accommodation of the Secretaries is Rules such as, Bangladesh Service Rules (BSR) and the Bangladesh Allocation Rules 1982 etc.<br/> <br/>As per the words of the statute “<em>A Judge shall be entitled to, and provided with</em>”, respondent nos. 1, 2 &amp; 5 are under a mandatory duty to arrange for accommodation, be that a hired or Government owned property. Entitlements prescribed in a statute shall always override and, thus, get preference to that of a Rule. An obligation imposed upon the Government functionaries vide the provisions of the Constitution may be compared with and termed as “Farj”, the highest obligation imposed by the holy Quran. If it is imposed by an act of Parliament, the same may be termed as “Wazib”, if the same is imposed by any Rule, it may be compared to “Sunnah” and if the source of obligation is any “Government Circular”, then the same may be considered as “Nafal”. The respondents are, thus, found to be more fanciful to perform “Sunnat” and “Nafal” leaving the “Farj” and “Wazib”. Islam being the state religion, as enshrined in Article 2A of our Constitution, the comparison is made for ease of understanding and aimed at simplif-ication of the duties and obligation of the respondents and, thus, without any prejudice to the Islamic law.<br/><br/>For the Secretaries to the Government, there is nothing to be jealous with the privileges and remuneration of the Judges of the Supreme Court, rather the state functionaries are expected to look after the Judges and should never disturb the Judges in enjoying their normal privileges and benefits, let alone providing any extra privileges.<br/> <br/>In the cases of <em>All Indian Judges’ Association vs Union of India (1993) 4 JT (SC) 618</em> the following observations were made:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“The judicial service is not service in the sense of employment of the judiciary; they exercise the sovereign judicial power of the State. They are holders of public offices as the ministers and the members of the legislature. When it is said that in a democracy such as ours, the executive, the legislature and the judiciary constitute the three pillars of the State,  what is intended to be conveyed is that the three essential functions of the State and each one of them in turn represents the authority of the State. However, those who exercise the State power are the ministers, the legislators and the judges, and not the members of their staff who implement or assist in implementing their decisions. The council of ministers or the political executive is different from the secretarial staff or the administrative executive which carries out the decisions of the political. Similarly, the legislators are different from the judicial staff. So also the judges from the judicial staff. The party is between the political executive, the legislators and the judges and not between the judges and the administrative executive. In some democracies like the USA, members of some State judiciaries are elected as much as the members of the legislature and the heads of the State. The Judges, at whatever level they may be, represent the State and its authority unlike the administrative executive or the members of other services. The members of the other services, therefore, cannot be placed on par with the members of the judiciary, either constitutional or functional. It is high time that all concerned appreciated that for the reasons pointed out above there cannot be any link between the service conditions of the judges and those of the members of the other service”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Let it be known to the people what a Supreme Court Judge gets after his elevation and what he is to sacrifice. Before being elevated as a Judge from the Bench or subordinate judiciary, all the Judges of the Supreme Court were financially better off in terms of earnings given that as a District Judge they used to enjoy comfortable accommodation arrangement in an independent bungalow type house in the District Headquarters and also, in addition to their monthly salaries, there were various benefits in their service life such as, judicial allowance and some ancillary allowances for attending Government meetings, seminars and trainings. And the judges who have been elevated from the bar used to earn a significant and considerable amount of money in their legal profession. People from both the arenas by the strength of their solvent background do accept the offer of holding a position of a Judge of the Supreme Court only in an expectation of getting honour from the society, otherwise, the offer for accepting the post of a Judge of the Supreme Court hardly could entice them, if it is to be considered in terms of payment of remuneration. The Judges of the Supreme Court, thus, do not get financially anything or any other privileges, which make this post too precious to be lured, rather they accept the offer of elevation for the greater interest of the nation with an interest to contribute something in the development of the jurisprudence. The lure, thus, is of the dignity and esteem attached to the position of a Judge and not of enjoyment of a sound financial position or any other pecuniary interest.<br/> <br/>Though the Judges require the state of solitude in preparing their verdicts, unfortunately still today the judges have not been provided with full logistic support that they need and the working condition of the judges also has not been upgraded as they have never been provided with adequate facilities and privileges besides raising the level of salary. The concerned organs of the State never give their attention and make earnest endeavour to this aspect of the case. The state functionaries should conceive and concede to the fact that in pronouncing a judgment, a Judge does everything on his own without taking assistance from his colleagues but the other state functionaries carries out their job being assisted or advised by their bosses or assistants, advisors or colleagues. Unlike other state functionaries, the Supreme Court Judges can never accomplish their works between 9 am to 5 pm, rather their work volume compels them to work day-night, even, during the vacations. They hardly find any time to go for social outings for recreation and with the passage of time in the said process they eventually become workaholics.<br/> <br/>In accepting the position of a judge, thus, the lawyers of the Supreme Court as well as the District Judges are to sacrifice huge financial benefits and other equally lucrative prospects. The Judges of the Supreme Court are entrusted with the duties of a sacred nature and after being positioned as a Judge of the Supreme Court, they place themselves in an isolated and aloof environment having remained incommu-nicado where they find themselves to be in a fragile condition, a state of being overwhe-lmingly professional preoccupation that others may find difficult to fathom.<br/>To portray the painstaking duty of a Judge, Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone expressed his feelings to the President Truman of the United States in the following words;<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“<em>Few are aware that neither my predecessor, nor 1, in more than twenty years since I have been a Justice of the Supreme Court, have been able to meet the daily demands upon us without working nights and holidays and Sundays. The administrative duties of the Chief Justice have increased and many other duties have been imposed on him by acts of Congress which my predecessors were not called on to perform.............. Unlike the functions of an executive officer, practically none of these can be delegated</em> (13<sup>th</sup> February 1946: cited at page 125 of the book titled “Judges and Justices”, supra).”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Justice William Brenan Jr narrated the Judges’ function in the following language;<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“<em>The writing of opinion is not easy work. It always takes weeks, and som-etimes, months. The most painstaking research and care go into the task. Research, of course, concentrates on relevant legal materials-precedents particularly. But Supreme Court cases often require also some familiarity with other disciplines-history, economics, the social and other sciences-and the authorities in these area are, too consulted</em>” (An Affair with Freedom Supra, page 336-338, also reproduced at page 192-193 of the book, “Judges and Justices”, supra).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Justice Blackburn of the United States Supreme Court relates the work load of a Judge of the Supreme Court in the following words;<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“<em>I have never worked harder and more concentratedly than since I came to Washington Just five years ago. I thought I had labored to the limits of my ability in private practice, in my work for a decade as a member of the Section of Administration of the Mayo organization, and as a Judge of the Court of Appeals. Here, however, the pressure is greater and more constant, and it relents little even during summer months. One, therefore, to a large extent relies on experience and an innate and, hopefully, developed proper judicial reaction. One had better be right! Good health is an absolute requisite. The normal extracurricular enjoyment of life becomes secondary, if it can be said that they exist at all</em>. “(Page 185, Judges and Justices, supra)”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Justice Mostafa Kamal, in describing his own experiences of the job of judgeship, states;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/>“<em>Snatching sometimes away from my days’ (and nights’) Court work, I have prepared these lectures all alone in my study</em>”. (Kamini Kumar Dutta Memorial Law Lectures 1994: Bangladesh Constitution: Trends and Issues: Page VIII).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The Supreme Court Judges are highly dignified persons whose appointments are made as per the provisions of the Constitutions and they are not subordinate and, thus, accountable to any authority including the Chief Justice, Prime Minister and President of the Republic in discharging their functions. Our Constitution, as provided in Article 94(4), has guaranteed the above position of the Judges. Moreover, Article 112 has asked all the authorities of the Republic to act in aid of the Supreme Court. Considering the above dignity of the position of the Judges of the Supreme Court, legislature in their wisdom have honoured the Judges of the High Court Divisions to hold the social status equivalent to a State Minister but it is curious enough that though there is no shortage as to the allocations of accommodations for other Constitutional post holders, either equivalent to the status of Supreme Court judges such as State Ministers or Election Commissioners or below to the Judges  such as Deputy Ministers, MPs etc, respondent nos. 1 &amp; 2 are habitually coming out with a ready excuse of non-availability of accommodation for the Judges of the Supreme Court, which  seems to be dubious and implausible and these actions of respondents have hardly ever been under any scrutiny.<br/> <br/>There are two vital reasons for allocation of residence to a Judge immediate after his elevations, which are (1) leading a community life is beneath the dignity of a Judge and (2) it will expose him to the members of the public. People will have easy excess to him which is bound to tarnish his image and in such situation a Judge may even be sold behind his back. Many of the judges of this Court reside in private houses and flats where there is no arrangement for safety and security. Besides, it exposes the judges to the members of the public who have easy excess to a judge. This kind of situation is not desirable. This makes the position of the judges vulnerable. In a developing country like ours, judges should maintain a distance from all and lead a secluded life for the reason that a judge should keep himself above all suspicion. In this regard we may follow the example of former Chief Justice Mr. Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed who, during the terms of office as a judge of this Court and the Chief Justice of Bangladesh, never allowed any one including his close relatives to visit his residence. He maintained a high degree of seclusion and that is ideal for our society.<br/> <br/>The Judges of this Court are oath bound to impart justice to all people, including the members of the executive branches and legislature, according to law without fear or favour, affection or ill-will. Regrettably, the members of the Executive, without apprising themselves of the nature of tasks of the Judges, very often take a hostile stand against this Court and the Judges which is most unfortunate. The executive must try their best to rise above self-interest and parochial consideration and extend co-operation to Supreme Court Judges with their legal entitlements and privileges instead of being jealous of them.<br/> <br/>It is not understood as to why the Secretaries, who have been occupying the bungalow type houses at Minto Road, Bailey Road and other places, have not chosen to stay in the flats earmarked for them as listed in annexure X(1) where a good number of Joint Secretary to Additional Secretaries are living. Those are F type accommodations and as per Rule 4 of the Bangladesh Allocation Rules, 1982, those are reserved and earmarked only for Senior Secretaries to Joint Secretaries and the Senior Secretaries/Secretaries would obviously get preference in getting allocation of the said earmarked flats as per the Rules, norms and practice. Until a single Secretary to the Government is in pipe line to get the said flat, the other officers with the rank below the Secretary should not be accommodated therein until the said earmarked type flats becomes available to them.<br/> <br/>Thus, it appears that the actions of the respondents in allocation of the bungalow type houses or superior type flats have been taken in sheer violation of the obligation imposed upon them by the Constitution and the Statute. Therefore, the allotment of House No. 12 at Minto Road in favour of respondent no. 3 and the allocations of other bungalow type houses situated at Minto Road, Bailey Road, Dhanmondi, Gulshan and Banani to the Government servants, which have not been earmarked for any <em>persona designate</em>, are declared to have been done illegally.<br/> <br/>We may now turn to the final issue of the instant Rules as to whether the impugned part of Section 4(1)(a) of the Ordinance, 1978 is liable to be deleted therefrom upon declaring the same ultra vires of Article 27, 29, 31 and 147 (2) of the Constitution and also repugnant to the scheme of the Supreme Court Judges (Remuneration and Privileges) Ordinance, 1978.<br/> <br/>The apparent reasons for attack on the impugned part of Section 4(1)(a) of the Supreme Court Judge’s (Remuneration and Privileges) Ordinance, 1978 are that, firstly, in case of non-availability of the houses/flats for the Supreme Court Judges, the concerned state functionaries get an extensive license not to provide the Judges with the accommodation despite the availability of bungalow type houses or superior type flats. Secondly, with the excuse of non-availability of the accommo-dation, the amount of money are being paid to the judges as residence allowance is too petty to compare with the facilities and benefits of the first part of the said Section 4(i)(a) of the Ordinance, 1978. And, thirdly, keeping the provisions of the payment of a specific amount of money as house allowances makes the Supreme Court Judges dependable on the executive and legislature as it requires a review to increase the amount of house allowances from time to time.<br/><br/>Now, let us take up the first point as to whether incorporation of the words “<em>and until such residence is provided---------</em>”, meaning “in the case of non-availability of the furnished houses”, creates a scope for the respondents to act arbitrarily in dealing with the Supreme Court Judges’ application for accommodation. It appears from the statements made in the supplementary affidavit of Writ Petition No. 5276 of 2013 that a bungalow type house at Mohammadpur is available for allocation but the same has not been shown in the list supplied by the respondents, which indicates that the concerned authorities who are entrusted with the duties of allocation of the houses for the Supreme Court Judges, are not earnest in tracing out the vacant bungalow type houses or superior flats for the Supreme Court Judges. Rather, they simply tend to avoid their duties by informing the Judges that houses are not available for allocation. It means that taking advantage of the second part of Section 4(1)(a) of the Ordinance, 1978, they instead of earnestly carrying out their duties as imposed upon them by the statutes in the following words <em>“ shall be entitled to and provided with”</em>, come out with the excuse of non-availability of the house and thereby abuse and exploit the provisions of the statute. Thus, we are of the view that the presence of the words “<em>and, until such residence is provided</em>”, in Section 4(1) (a) of the Ordinance frustrates the spirit of the statute which intends to actually provide a furnished residence for the Supreme Court Judges. It is our considered view that incorporation of any word/s in a statute, if gives unfettered discretionary power to the authority in taking a decision on a matter of statutory obligation, then, the presence of the said words is repugnant to the scheme of the said law and, consequently, deserves to be deleted therefrom. In the case of Dr. Nurul Islam vs Bangladesh reported in 33 DLR (AD) 201, the unfettered discretionary power of the Government as to sending any public servant on compulsory retirement was held to have been illegal being vitiated by malice in law.<br/> <br/>Now, let us pick up the second point as to the payment of money to the Supreme Court Judges as residence allowance. All the Judges of the High Court Division of the Supreme Court do stand on similar footings and when a High Court Judge is allowed to enjoy <em>a furnished residence free from any rent and charges of electricity, water and gas</em>”, he enjoys a benefit of around Tk. 2(two) lacs and, on other hand, a Judge receives only Tk. 26,600/- as residence allowance because of non-availability of the furnished house, which appears to be a striking unequal treatment and, thus, ridiculous given that the very purpose of incorporation of residence allowance is to allow and enable the non-allottee Judges to privately arrange for their accommodation but the said amount, cannot even meet half the costs of a suitable house because most of the judges live in 4 to 5 bedroom flats which incurs costs of, inclusive of service charges, bills of gas, water and electricity, around seventy to eighty thousand taka and, similarly, the judges who live in their own flat or house, if those are rented out, would get a rent of around Taka seventy to eighty thousand from their tenants. In figuring out the amount of residence allowance, the concerned authority should have taken into consideration if the Government has to hire or requisition houses or flats of 4200-4500 square feet for the High Court Judges at a sparsely populated residential area in terms of being conducive to their security, it would cost around 1 lac taka, inclusive service charges and bills. Thus, it appears that the amount of residence allowance of Tk. 26,600/- is too low to arrange for a suitable accommodation for the Judges privately.<br/> <br/>In this context, it becomes a pertinent question that on what objective basis or standard the amount of house allowance is assessed and determined. We did not get any clue to the said question from the respondents. In absence of any guidelines for assessment and determination of the amount of house allowance, there is always a serious likeliness of deprivation of enjoying rational amount of house allowance by which a Judge may be able to cope up with the expenses of privately rented house.<br/> <br/>In our view, “the Committee on Pay and Privilege of the Supreme Court Judges” formed by the Government, as stated by respondent no. 5 in its affidavit in opposition, should have its authority from the Ordinance, 1978, which may be constituted by incorporating a Section in the Ordinance, 1978. The said Committee may be headed by the Auditor and Comptroller General of Bangladesh and the Finance Secretary, the Law Secretary, the Housing and Works Secretary, the Registrar of the Supreme Court and the Chief Executives of both the City Corporations of Dhaka should be the members of the Committee. The said Committee shall mandatorily sit, at least twice in every calendar year, may be in the last week of each June and December, for carrying out the following tasks (i) to decide as to whether there is any need to hire the flats/houses for the non-allottee judges, a better resolution of the accommodation problems in case of non-availability of the Government owned houses, (ii) to get the data and information as to living costs of a dignitary with his family including the amount of prevailing rates of house rent from the Dhaka City Corporations and from the Councilors of the Wards of the areas where the Supreme Court Judges are supposed to be housed such as the residential areas within the proximity of the Supreme Court or Dhanmondi, Gulshan and Banani and the areas where the Judges live in their own accommodation (iii) approve the rent agreements of the non-allotee judges entered with their landlords and their bills of electricity, gas, water and service charges (iv) to assess the rental value of the flats/houses of the judges who are living in their own acco-mmodation and to periodically review the said rental value on their own or upon the request of judges made through the Registrar and, if required, increase the amount of house allowance in order to adapt to the costs of living.<br/> <br/>Now, let us take up the third point that incorporation of a specific amount of money as house allowance in the second part of Section 4(1) (a) of the Ordinance, 1978 makes the judges dependable on the executives as the concerned authorities never feel urge to spontaneously increase the same enabling the Judges to cope with the changed socio-economic condition. The past experiences lead us to believe that above contention is not a mere apprehension of the petitioners but, in true sense, it is a reality. Though the Judges should not be expected to approach the executive for their privileges which they are legally entitled to but unfortunately, in practice, the Judges do not get anything without approaching them. While, in this 21<sup>st</sup> century, the Judges of the Supreme Court are dealing with a huge number of litigations where the executives are the parties, it is not desirable that the Judges of the Supreme Court would be placed in a situation to keep contacts with the parties of the litigations, here the executive, pending before them. In other words, since the State in the present day has become the major litigant and the superior courts have become centers of turbulent controversies, some of which with a flavour of political repercussion, and the Courts have to face tempest and storm because their vitality and neutrality is a national imperative, and, in such circumsta-nces, the Government, namely the major litigant, cannot be justified in enjoying absolute authority as to sanctioning any particular privilege to its arbitrator. The executive cannot be allowed to enjoy the absolute authority in the matter of fixation of remuneration and/or with providing other privileges for the Supreme Court Judges as its ‘royal privilege’ or prerogative. If such a process is allowed to continue, the independence of judiciary will remain a distant dream.<br/> <br/>It is often forgotten why a Court and its Judges are so important in comparison to other state functionaries and why they must be independent even while remaining otherwise a co-equal organ of the State. The reason is that all rights are rights against the State. The Supreme Court Judges must be able to overturn unconstitutional law passed by Parliament, it must overrule the illegitimate actions of the police, the bureaucrats, and the Army and even the President or the Prime Minister if they go against the law of the land. Only when the Supreme Court Judges have this power they can protect the citizen from the arbitrariness of the State. Moreover, the Court must protect bureaucrats against the Parliament, the Parliament against undemocratic forces. The Court must be able to protect the Military so that it can preserve national security. The Court must protect the rights of policemen and so on.<br/>In the case of SP Gupta Vs President of India AIR 1982 SC 149, to describe the position and importance of the Judges and Judiciary, Justice P.N. Bhagwati articulated that :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“.............The concept of independence of the judiciary is a noble concept which inspires the constitutional scheme and constitutes the foundation on which rests the edifice of our democratic polity. If there is one principle which runs through the entire fabric of the Constitution, it is the principle of the rule of law and under the Constitution, <u>it is the judiciary which is entrusted with the task of keeping every organ of the State within the limits of the law and thereby making the rule of law meaningful and effective. </u>It is to aid the judiciary in this task that the power of judicial review has been conferred upon the judiciary and it is by exercising this power which constitutes one of the most potent weapons in armory of the law, that the judiciary seeks to protect the citizen against violation of his constitutional or legal rights or misuse or abuse of power by the State or its officers. <u>The Judiciary stands between the citizen and the State as a bulwark against executive excesses and, misuse or abuse of power by the executive and therefore, it is absolutely essential that the judiciary just be free from executive pressure or influence and this</u> has been secured by the Constitution makers by making elaborate provisions in the Constitution to which detailed reference has been made in the judgments is Sankalchand Sheth’s case (AIR 1977 SC 2328) (supra). But it is necessary to remind ourselves that the concept of independence of the judiciary is not limited only to independence from executive pressure to independence from executive pressure or influence but it is a much wider concept which takes within its sweep independence from many other pressures and prejudices. It has many dimensions, namely fearlessness of other power centres, economic or political, and freedom from prejudices acquired and nourished by the class to which the Judges belong. It we may again quote the eloquent words of Justices Krishna Iyer: </em><br/><em>“Independences of the Judiciary is not genuflexion; nor is it opposition to every proposition of Government. It is neither judiciary made to opposition measure nor Government’s pleasure....</em><br/><em>...... <u>Judges should be of stern stuff and tough fibre, unbending before power, economic or political and they must uphold the core principle of the rule of law which says “Be you ever so high, the law is above you”.</u> This is the principle of independence of the judiciary which is vital for the establishment of real participatory democracy, maintenance of the rule of law as a dynamic concept and delivery of social justice to the vulnerable sections of the community. It is this principle of independence of the judiciary which we must keep in mind while interpreting the relevant provisions of the Constitution.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Justice AR Cornelius in the case of Fazlul Qader Chowdhury Vs Muhammad Abdul Haque PLD 1963 SC 486 said about the duty of the Court:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“The duty of interpreting the Constitution is, in fact a duty of enforcing the provision of the Constitution in any particular case brought before the courts in the form of litigation.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Secretary, Ministry of Finance Vs Masdar Hossain (2000) (viii) BLT (AD) 234 Chief Justice Mustafa Kamal said about the functions of the Judiciary:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“60.......<u>When Parliament and the executive, instead of Chapter II of Part VI follow a different course not sanctioned by the Constitution, the higher Judiciary is within its jurisdiction to bring back the Parliament and the executive form constitutional derailment and give necessary directions to follow the constitutional course.</u> This exercise was made by this Court in the case of Kudrat-E-Elahi Panir Vs Bangladesh, 44 DLR (AD) 319. <u>We do not see why the High Court Division or this Court cannot repeat that exercise when a constitutional deviation is detected</u> and when there is a constitutional mandate to implement certain provisions of the Constitution. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It is, thus, fundamental for the establishment of the rule of law that the judiciary should be allowed to function uninterruptedly without being influenced by the executives.<br/>The above threadbare examinations leads us to hold that presence of an alternative option in Section 4(i)(a) of the Ordinance, 1978 in the event of failure by the respondents to provide the Judges with houses defeats the scheme of the law that “<u>A Judge shall be entitled to, and provided with</u>” in a three-fold way. Firstly, it paves the way for the concerned authorities to refrain from providing the Judges with furnished government houses, secondly, the residence allowance figured therein does not become of any use for the Judges to arrange for privately rented house and, thirdly, threatens the independence of the judiciary as the judiciary is pushed to be dependent upon the members of the executive for increase of the amount of the residence allowance by making overturns to them.<br/> <br/>Thus, the facts and figures portrayed hereinbefore reveals that due to the aforesaid flaws and negative aspects of the incorporation of the impugned part of Section 4(1)(a) of the Ordinance, 1978, the non-allottee Judges are being victim of unequal treatment. Now, the question is whether the said victimization of the deprived Judges may be a ground for declaring the impugned law ultra vires. To find the answer, we have to first search for the authority and power of this Court to declare a law void.<br/> <br/>Article 7 of our Constitution heralds the Supremacy of the Constitution.<br/> </div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">All powers in the republic belong to the people, and their exercise on behalf of the people shall be effected only under, and by the authority of, this Constitution. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">This Constitution is, as the solemn expression of the will of the people, the supreme law of the Republic, and <u>if any other law is inconsistent with this Constitution that other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void</u>”. (underlined by us) </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Is the impugned law inconsistent with any provisions of the Constitution and thereby requires the same to be declared void under the authority and power of Article 7(2). Here, the impugned part of Section 4(1)(a) of the Ordinance, 1978 has been branded to be contradictory with Article 27, 29, 31 and 147(2) of the Constitution. Since Article 27, 29 and 31 are grouped in the same Part (Part iii) of our Constitution and their <em>modus operandi </em>being same, for convenience of our discussion, we will take up those Articles later on.<br/> <br/>We, therefore, undertake Article 147 (2), first, to see whether the impugned legislation is inconsistent with the same and thereby attracts the treatment of the scheme of Article 7(2) of our Constitution. We fancy to undertake the said scrutiny by examining the case laws of our jurisdiction and foreign jurisdiction with the spirit of Article 7(2) of our Constitution.<br/>Article 147 (2) of our Constitution declares that:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>(2) The remuneration, <em><u>privileges</u></em> and other terms and conditions of service of a person holding or acting in any office to which article applies <em><u>shall not be varied to the disadvantage</u></em> of any such person during his term of office” (underlined by us).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From a plain reading of Article 147(2) it appears that the State shall not make any legislation to the disadvantage of the Supreme Court Judges. But it has clearly been found by our minute examination and elaborate discussion made hereinbefore that the payment of house allowance of Tk. 26,600/- have been fixed to the disadvantage of the Supreme Court Judges.<br/><br/>In the case of Marbury Vs Madison (1803), Chief Justice Marshal recorded the supremacy of the Constitution in the following language:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“Thus, the particular phraseology of the Constitution of the United states confirms and strengthens the principle, supposed to be essential to all written constitutions, that a <u>law repugnant to the constitution is void; and that courts, as well as other departments, are bound by that instrument.”</u></em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the Special reference Case No. 1 of 1964 (AIR 1965 SC 745), Chief Justice of India PB Gajendragadkar said :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em><u>In a democratic country governed by a written Constitution, it is the Constitution which is supreme and sovereign</u></em><em>. It is no doubt true that the Constitution itself can be amended by the Parliament, but that is possible because Art. 368 of the Constitution itself makes a provision in that behalf, and the amendment of the Constitution can be validly made only by following procedure prescribed by the said article. That shows that even when the Parliament purports to amend the Constitution, it has to comply with the relevant mandate of the Constitution itself. <u>Legislators, Ministers, and Judges all take oath of allegiance to the Constitution, for it is by the relevant provisions of the Constitution that they derive their authority and jurisdiction and it is to the provisions of the Constitution that they owe allegiance</u>. Therefore, there can be no doubt that the sovereignty which can be claimed by Parliament in England, cannot be claimed by Legislature in India in the literal by absolute sense.   </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Asma Jihani Vs Government of Punjab, PLD 1972 SC139 (relevant page-199) Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman said :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“.........General Agha Mohammad Yahia Khan had, according to me, no authority to pass such legislation taking away the powers of the Courts in his capacity as President under the Provisional Constitution Order.

Thus, it was held <em>ultra vires</em> the Constitution. Since the birth of Bangladesh, our Supreme Court for the first time struck down an amendment to the Constitution made by the Parliament, the supreme and sovereign law making body under the Constitution relying upon the ratio decidendi of the following Indian cases; <em>Keshavanda </em>reported in AIR 1973 SC 1461,<em> Indira Gandhi </em>reported in AIR 1975 SC 1590,<em> Minarva Mills </em>reported in AIR 1980 SC 1789 and<em> Woman Rao </em>reported in AIR 1981 SCR 1 to base its decision. The Court held in particular:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“The Constitution stands on certain fundamental principles which are its structural pillars which the parliament cannot amend by its amending power for, if these pillars are demolished or damaged, then the whole constitutional edifice will fall down.  </em><br/><em>If any provision can be called the ‘pole star’ of the Constitution, then it is the preamble. The impugned Amendment is to be examined on the touchstone of the preamble with or without resorting to the doctrine of basic structure. The preamble is not only a part of the Constitution, it now stands as an entrenched provision that cannot be amended by parliament alone. When parliament cannot by itself amend the preamble, it cannot indirectly by amending a provision of the Constitution impair or destroy the fundamental aim of our society. One of the fundamental aims of out society is to secure the rule of law for all citizens and in furtherance of that aim part VI and other provisions were incorporated in the Constitution. By the impugned Amendment that structure of the rule of law has been badly impaired and as a result the High Court Division has fallen into sixes and sevens-six at the seats of the permanent Benches and the seven at the permanent seat of the Supreme Court. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Khandaker Delwar Hossain -Vs- Italian Marble Company Limited reported in 2010 BLD Special, (the 5<sup>th</sup> amendment case), the Supreme Court declared all Martial Law Proclamations, orders, regulations, rules issued and executed under the first martial law regime, ratified by the 5<sup>th</sup> amendment of the Constitution, unconstitutional as it found that some basic structures of the constitution were destroyed through the 5<sup>th</sup> amendment of the Constitution.<br/><br/>In the 7<sup>th</sup> Amendment Case (the case of Siddique Ahmed –Vs- Bangladesh) reported in 2013 Counsel (Special), our Supreme Court declared all Martial Law Proclamations, order, regulation, rules issued and executed under the second martial law regime, ratified by the 7<sup>th</sup> amendment of the Constitution, unconstitutional as it found that some basic structures of the constitution were destroyed through the 7<sup>th</sup> amendment of the Constitution. <br/> <br/>In the case of Md. Abdul Mannan Khan –Vs- Bangladesh reported in the book “The 13<sup>th</sup> Amendment Judgment” published by the CCB foundation, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court declared the provisions of the Amendment Act ulrta vires the Constitution.<br/><br/>In the case of Sultana Kamal Vs Bangladesh reported in 14 BLC (2009) 141, Section 5 of the Emergency Power Ordinance, 2007 was declared to be ultra vires the Constitution.<br/> <br/>In the case of M. Samsul Haque and others -Vs- Bangladesh and others reported in 17 BLT (HCD) 523 an Ordinance namely, 'আদালত অবমাননা অধ্যাদেশ, ২০০৮' was declared to be ultra vires the Constitution by the High Court Division as the impugned legislation was found to have been promulgated in contravention of Article 93 and 58 (D) of the Constitution.<br/> <br/>Also, in the case of Monzur Ahmed Bhuiyan and others Vs Adilur Rahman Khan and others reported in 18 BLC (AD) 47, the Apex Court uphold the judgment of the High Court Division which declared the 'স্বপ্রনোদিত তথ্য প্রকাশ অধ্যাদেশ, ২০০৮' to be ultra vires the Constitution.<br/> <br/>In the case of Idrisur Rahman –Vs- Bangladesh reported in 60 DLR 714 where the vires of an ordinance namely, Supreme Judicial Commission Ordinance, 2008 was challenged and by a majority decision of a Special Bench of the High Court Division Section 9(4) of the said Ordinance was declared to be ultra vires the Constitution.<br/><br/>In all these cases either an Act of Parliament or a particular Section/provision thereof was challenged on the ground of being inconsistent to any Article of the Constitution and it was declared that there can be no Act/law, be that an amendment of the Constitution or enactment of a statue, which defies the supremacy of the Constitution and destroys the basic feature of the Constitution.<br/> <br/>Like the above-discussed cases, to here, in this case as well we find that the Supremacy of the said Article 147(2) has been flouted by incorporation of the impugned part of Section 4(1) of the Ordinance, 1978. It follows that the second part of Section 4(1)(a) of the Ordinance, 1978 is violative of Article 147(2) of the Constitution.<br/> <br/>Above were the case laws involving the challenges of the various Acts of Parliament for being inconsistent mainly with the scheme and spirit of the different provisions of the Constitution, other than Article 27, 29 and 31.<br/> <br/>Now let us now take up the said Articles in tandem with Article 26 of our Constitution and some case laws of our jurisdiction and foreign jurisdiction, where a number of Acts of Parliament were struck down for being inconsistent with the provisions of Part III of our Constitution.<br/> <br/>Article 26 declares that Laws inconsistent with fundamental rights to be void.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">All existing laws inconsistent with the provisions of this Part shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, become void on the commencement of this Constitution.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><u>The State shall not make any law inconsistent with any provisions of this part, and any law so made shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void</u>”. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Article 27 :</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><u>All citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law</u><em>.  </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>Article 29 :</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><u>There shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in respect of employment or office in the service of the Republic</u><em>.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;">No citizens shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth, be ineligible for, or discriminated against in respect of, any employment or office in the service of the Republic.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Nothing in this article shall prevent the State form-</li></ol><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;">making special provision in favour of any backward section of citizens for the purpose of securing their adequate representation in the service of the Republic;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">giving effect to any law which makes provision for reserving appointments relating any religious or denominational institution to persons of that religion or denomi-nation;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">reserving for members of one sex any class of appointment or office on the ground that it is considered by its nature to be unsuited to members of the opposite sex. (underlined by us)</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Let us also consider the meaning and scope of Article 5(1) and Article 15 of the Constitution of Pakistan of 1956 and 1962 respectively and Article 14 of the Constitution of India (Corresponding Article 27 to our Constitution) which reads thus:<br/> <br/>“The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India”. <br/> <br/>This again corresponds to the last Clause of the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment of the American Constitution which reads as follows:<br/> <br/>“All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States, nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; nor deny to any person with its Jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws”.<br/> <br/>Now, the question before us is whether the above guarantees of the Constitution, as engraved in Article 26, 27 and 29, have been disregarded in the impugned legislation, namely second part of Section 4(1)(a) of the Ordinance, 1978.<br/> <br/>Let us first understand what ‘the equality before law’ means.<br/> <br/>Sir Ivor Jennings in his “The Law and the Constitution” has stated:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“Equality before the law means that among equals the law should be equally administered, that like should be treated alike”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Dicey in his “law of the Constitution’, stated:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“Equality before the law does not mean absolute equality of men which is a physical impossibility, but the denial of any special privileges by reason of birth, creed or the like, in favour of any individual and also the equal subjection of all individuals and classes to the ordinary law of the land administered by the ordinary law Courts”. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the “Limitations of Government Power” by Rotundy and others “equal protection of the laws” has been described as:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“The equal protection clause guarantees that similar individuals will be dealt with in a similar manner by the government. It does not reject the government’s ability to classify persons or draw lines in creation and application of laws, but it does guarantee that those classifications will not be based upon impermissible criteria or arbitrarily used to burden a group of individuals. Such a classific-ation does not violate the guarantee when it distinguishes persons as ‘dissi-milar’ upon some permissible basis in order to advance the legitimate interest of society”. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Professor Wills who in his book “Constitutional Law” Edn. 1 p. 578, viewed the Fourteenth Amendment in the following expressions:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“It forbids class legislation, but does not forbid classification which rests upon reasonable grounds of distinction. It does not prohibit legislation, which is limited either in the objects to which it is directed or by the territory within which it is to operate. It merely requires that all persons subjected to such legislation shall be treated alike under like circumstances and conditions both in the privileges conferred and in the liabilities imposed’. The inhibition of the amendment was designed to prevent any person or class of persons from being singled out as a special subject for discriminating and hostile legislation”. It does not take from the States the power to classify either in the adoption of Police laws or tax laws,, or eminent domain laws, but permits to them the exercise of a wide scope of discretion, and nullifies what they do only  when it is without any reasonable basis. If any state of facts can reasonably be conceived to sustain a classification, the existence of that state of facts must be assumed. One who assails a classification must carry the burden of showing that it does not rest upon any reasonable basis”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Mahmudul Islam in his “Constitutional Law of Bangladesh” (3<sup>rd</sup> Edition, Page 227) comments that<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“<em>Discrimination in the matter of condition of service of the same category of employees is a violation of Articles 27 and 29</em>”.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">The sum and substances of the above commentaries by the distinguished Authors is that Article 27 and 29 of our Constitution and Article 14 of Indian Constitution and the First Section of the fourteenth Amendment mainly mandates as to equality before law, meaning enjoying the guarantee of equal treatment with others with same footing in all the spheres of life, in particular, in enjoyment of equal opportunity in the event of entry in the public office/employment as well as after holding the public office or being employed therein.     <br/> <br/>Let us cite some American Cases on Article 27 and 29 (therein First Section of the fourteenth Amendment).<br/> <br/>The United States Supreme Court in Middleton Vs. Texas P &amp; L Co, 248 U.S. 152, observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“It must be presumed that a Legislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people, that its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and that its discriminations are based upon adequate grounds”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Bruen J, in Gulf colorado Rly. v. Ellis,165 U.S. 150, however, warned against carrying this presumption too far and observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“To carry the presumption to the extent of holding that there must be some undisclosed and unknown reason for subjecting certain individuals or corporations to hostile and discri-minatory legislation is to make the protection clause of the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment a mere  rope of sand”. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In Southern Rly Co. V. Grane, 216 U.S. 400 Day-J observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/><em>“Equal protection of the laws means subjection to equal laws, applying alike to all in the same situation”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>American Judges regard this provision of ‘equality before law, and ‘equal protection of law’ as the “basic principle of republicanism’ and the American Judges and Jurists made ‘a pledge of the protection of equal laws’ as their subject of interest in numerous cases.<br/> <br/>We may now refer to some case laws of Indian jurisdiction on Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India being akin to Articles 27 and 29 of our Constitution.<br/> <br/>Bhagawati J, in Shujat Ali Vs. Union of India, AIR 1974, SC 1631 observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“The doctrine of classification should not be carried to a point where instead of being a useful servant it becomes a dangerous master”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In Lachmon Das Vs.

Indira Gandhi V. Raj Narayan”, AIR 1975, SC 2279 described his idea of equality as:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“All who are equal are equal in the eye of law”, meaning that it will not accord favoured treatment to persons within the same class”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the Case of Bhoomi Vikash Bank Ltd Vs its workmen reported in AIR 1990 SC 495 it was held that payment of higher emolument to the staff of one unit as against that of other units is discriminatory.<br/> <br/>In the case of State of West Bengal v. Anowar Ali Sarkar, AIR 1952, SC 75, the Supreme Court of India struck down S.5(1) of the West Bengal Special Courts Act, 1950 as vocative of Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. The impugned section of the law provides that a special court shall try offences or classes of offences or cases or classes of cases as the State Government may direct. Contention of the accused-respondent was that this provision gave arbitrary power to the Government to choose any accused person for trial before the Special Court which follows a harsher procedure than the ordinary courts and as such it offended Article 14 of the Constitution. This  contention was upheld with the observation that “<em>the Act has completely ignored the principle of classification followed in the Cr. P.C. and has laid down a new procedure without making any attempt to particularize or classify the offences or cases to which it is to apply</em>”.<br/> <br/>In Dhirendra Kumar Vs. Government of West Bengal, AIR 1954, SC 424, a similar question arose and the Supreme Court upheld the contention of the accused-applicant that the impugned Notification of the State Government revoking its previous Notification, by which the accused was granted trial by Jury under section 269(1) Cr. P.C., and directing his trial with the aid of Assessors, offended the equality provision in Article 14 given that the classification of cases and offences to be tried with the aid of Assessors as per Government Notification was not based on any substantial distinction.<br/> <br/>In Panduranga Rao Vs. Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission, AIR 1963, SC 268, a rule made by the Government of the Province laying down certain special qualifications for recruitment of District Munsifs was challenged on the ground that it made arbitrary classification between Advocates of one High court and those of other High Courts of India. The rule says that a candidate for the post of District Munsif, among other things, must be an advocate of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh. The Supreme Court found that this rule introduced a classification between one class of advocates and the rest and that this classification was irrational inasmuch as there was no nexus between the basis of the classification and the object intended to be achieved by the relevant rule. The Court observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“<em>When any impugned rule or statutory provision is assailed on the ground that it contravenes Art, 14, its validity can be sustained if two tests are satisfied. The classification... must be based on an intelligent differentia which distinguished persons or things grouped together from others left out of the group, and the second is that the differentia must have a reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved by the rule of statutory provision</em>.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Bank Nationalization reported in AIR 1970 SC 564, the Supreme Court, while deciding the question of violation of the right to equal treatment in Article 14 of the Indian Constitution, struck down section 15(2) of Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertaking) Act, 1969. Under the aforesaid enactment undertakings of fourteen Commercial Banks in India were taken over by the State and vested in the Union of India, and the Banks were prohibited from engaging in the business of banking in India. The Supreme Court of India struck down the offending provision of the Act on the ground that there was hostile discrimination against the Banks in that they were prohibited from carrying on banking business whereas other banks, Indian and foreign, were permitted to carry on the banking business. It was termed by their Lordships as a flagrant hostile discrimination against the fourteen named Banks.<br/> <br/>The case of Indira Gandhi Vs. Raj Narayan (AIR 1975 SC 2299) is a glaring instance of discriminatory legislation offending “equality before law”. There, amended Art. 329-A(4) of the Indian Constitution was assailed, among other things, on the ground of arbitrary classification. Indira Gandhi’s election to Lokshabha held in March 1971 was held void by the Allahabad High Court and against that decision she preferred an appeal before the Supreme Court. During pendency of the appeal, Indian Parliament amended the Constitution inserting therein Article 329-A. Clause (4) of this Article made the existing Election Laws retrospectively inapplicable to Parliamentary elections of the Prime Minister and the Speaker; it kept the election of these two personages, who are members of Parliament, beyond the reach of any law past or present; it declared the disputed election of Indira Gandhi valid.<br/> <br/>And further declared that the judgment of the Allahabad High Court was void and the election petition challenging her election abated. Existing election laws were however kept alive to be applicable to elections of all other members of the Parliament. The Supreme Court struck down clause (4) as grossly discriminatory.<br/> <br/>The above Indian cases are some illustrations where the Courts found the impugned legislations to be inconsistent with provisions akin or similar to those in Part III of the Bangladesh Constitution and declared the same to be void under authority vested in a manner similar to Article 26 of our Constitution.<br/> <br/>The broad principles governing the application and extent of the Article 14 (ours in Article 27 and 29) have been interacted and reiterated in so many Indian cases that “<em>it would be an idle parade of familiar learning to review the multitudinous cases in which the constitutional assurance of equality before the law has been applied</em>” observed Mathew, J. in AIR 1974 SC 1300. In later decisions AIR 1979 SC 478 and AIR 1981 SC 2138 Chandrachud C.J. and Bhagwati, J. (as he then was) respectively observed that the proposit-ions applicable to cases arising under Article 14 have been repeated so many times during the last 30 years in course of “<em>the avalanche of the cases which have flooded this court</em>” since the commencement of the Constitution that they now sound almost platitudinous.<br/> <br/>From the discussions of the above laws and cases on Article 14 of Indian Constitution and the last Clause of the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment of the American Constitution (which are similar to Article 27 of our Constitution), it can be summed up that there cannot be a single law to be applied uniformly to all persons disregarding their basic differences with others. Once the differences are indentified, then the persons or things may be classified into different categories according to those distinctions, which are known as ‘permissible criteria’ or “intelligible differentia”. The legislatures in the process of making law with certain object in view, which is either to remove some evil or to confer some benefit, are empowered to make classification on reasonable basis. Class legislation is forbidden but classification of persons for the purpose of legislation is permitted. To pass the test of ‘equality’ a classification, besides being based on intelligent differentia, must have logical relation with the object the legislature intends to achieve by making the classification. A classification is reasonable if it aims at giving special treatment to a backward section of the population. It is also permissible to deal out distributive justice by taxing the privileged class and subsidizing the poor section of the people. What is of fundamental importance in law-making is that while making a classification the legislature shall not act arbitrarily but make selection on rational basis.<br/> <br/>In our Jurisdiction, in the case of Hamidul Huq Chowdhury Vs Bangladesh reported in 34 DLR 190, Section 6 of the Government-owned Newspapers (Management) Act, 1975 was declared to be inconsistent with Article 27 of the Constitution as the impugned section had granted unfettered and arbitrary power to enlist the printing and press companies for vesting their ownerships in the Government among the similarly situated companies.<br/> <br/>In the case of Zainul Abedin Vs Bangladesh reported in 34 DLR 77, the Government Servants (Seniority of Freedom Fighters) Rules, 1979 was knocked down on the ground of being violative of Article 27 and 29 of the Constitution.<br/> <br/>On the other hand, there are innumerable cases of our jurisdiction where the challenges to the vires of specific laws were found to be without merit and substance by the Courts such as the case of Bangladesh Krishi Bank -Vs- Meghna Enterprise and others reported in 50 DLR (AD) 194, SA Sabur Vs Returning Officer 41 DLR (AD) 30, Chandpur Textile Mills Ltd Vs Subordinate Judge reported in 2 BLC 50, Anisur Rahman Vs Bangladesh 12 BLC 22 and so on.<br/> <br/>In the case of S.A. Sabur Vs- Returning Officer reported in 41 DLR (AD) 30, the vires of Section 7(2)(g) of the local Government Ordinance, 1983, was challenged on the ground that the said Section 7(2)(g) is discriminatory and thereby violative of Article 27 of the Constitution inasmuch as the said section though makes a provision disqualifying the loan defaulters to be a candidate of the Union Parishad but there being no such provision for disqualifying the MP candidates, the law was blamed to be discriminatory and our Appellate Division after reviewing a number of cases from India, Pakistan and U.S.A. rejected the contentions of the petitioners on the ground that the impugned piece of legislation had not been hit by Article 27 of the Constitution inasmuch as the Union Parishad Chairmans and the Members of Parliament are not similarly situated persons and the provision of equal treatment is applicable only when there will be unequal treatment among the same class being at par.<br/> <br/>But, in the case at hand, all the Judges of the High Court Division are similarly situated dignitaries, irrespective of their age or date of elevation in the Bench and, as such, they being the members of same class deserve to be treated equally and no law should make any discriminatory provision for which one judge will enjoy some benefit and other Judge will be deprived of the same.<br/> <br/>In the said SA Sabur’s case at page 55 (Para 69), his Lordship A.T.M. Afjal, J (as he then was) elaborated the principles governing the scope, nature and parameters of Article 27 in the following language.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>The principle of equality does not mean that every law must have universal application for all persons who are not by nature, attainment or circumstances in the same position, and the varying needs of different classes of persons require separate treatment. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>It requires that all persons shall be treated alike, under like circumstances and conditions, both in the privileges conferred and in the liabilities imposed. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>it forbids class legislation but it does not forbid reasonable classification for the purpose of legislation. In order, however, to pass the test of permissible classification two conditions must be fulfilled, namely, (i) that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group and (ii) that the differentia must have  a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statute in question. The classification may be founded on different bases, namely, geographical or according to objects or occupations or the like, what is necessary is that there must be a nexus between the basis of classification and the object of the Act under consideration. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>The State, in the exercise of its government power, has of necessity to make laws operating differently on different groups or classes of persons to attain particular ends in giving effect to its policies, and it must possess for that purpose large powers of distinguishing and classifying persons or things to be subjected to such laws. The laws can make and set apart the classes according to the needs and exigencies of the Society and as suggested by experience. It can recognize even degree of evil, but the classification should never be arbitrary, artificial or evasive. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>To overdo classification, however, is to undo equality. The doctrine of classification should not be carried to a point where instead of being an useful servant, it becomes a dangerous master, for otherwise, the guarantee of equality will be submerged in class legislation masquerading as laws meant to govern well marked classes characterized by different and distinct at attainments.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>The Courts should not insist on delusive exactness or classification in any given case. Classification is justified if it is not palpably arbitrary.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>There is always a presumption in favour of the Constitutionality of a Statute and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a clear transgression of the Constitutional principles. This rule is based on the assumption, Judicially recognized and accepted, that the Legislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people, its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and its discriminations are based on adequate grounds.</em></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Upon consideration of the philosophies propounded by these noble Judges and Philosophers as to the meaning of the “equality before law and equal protection of the law” it is this Court’s considered view that “Equality before law” should not be taken in its absolute sense to hold that all persons are equal in all respects irrespective of their different conditions and circumstances in which they are placed or special qualities and characteristics which some of them may possess and others may lack. By the term ‘protection of equal law’, it is not meant that all persons or things are equal in all cases, rather it is to mean that the persons similarly situated should be treated alike. Provisions of equal protection, as engraved in our Constitution, guarantees that similar people will be dealt with in a similar way and people of different circumstances will be treated in a dissimilar way.<br/> <br/>In the instant cases, the main ground for challenging the constitutionality of the second part of 4(1)(a) of the Ordinance, 1978 is that the Judges of the Supreme Court are being unequally treated albeit all of them are similarly situated. It appears to be a startling provision of law that while a Supreme Court Judge being provided with government accommodation is without any worries about maintaining the costs of accommodation, the non-allottee Judges are pushed in a situation to strive mitigating the awful state of affairs as to the same given that it is not possible for a non-allotee Judge to manage his accommodation affairs with a cost of Taka 26600/00, which is a grossly discriminatory part of the Ordinance, 1978 and, thus, repugnant to the object intended to be achieved by the relevant law.<br/> <br/>From the above threadbare examination it appears that the presence of the second part of Section 4(1)(a) “--<em>and until such residence is provided----</em>” makes the deprived Judges victim of hostile and unequal treatment, thus, being the same inconsistent with Article 27 and 29 of the Constitution is required to be declared to be void for being ultra vires the Constitution.<br/> <br/>Furthermore, in enactment of any legislation, the test of reasonableness is to be passed. Article 31 prohibits Parliament from passing an unreasonable or arbitrary law, both from the substantive and procedural points of view. From the substantive point of view a law will be violative of Article. 31 if the Court finds that it is so demonstrably unreasonable or arbitrary that the members of Parliament acting as reasonable men could not pass that law. In view of our findings made hereinbefore that the amount of Tk. 26,600.00 as residence allowance is clearly to the disadvantage of the privileges of a Judge, the fixation of the said amount is, thus, an unreasonable and arbitrary law.<br/> <br/>In the case of Malpe Viswanath vs Moharashtra (1998) 2 SCC 1, it was held that a law when passed may be justified, but may later on become arbitrary or unreasonable with the lapse of time and change of circumstances.<br/> <br/>Here, in these cases, it transpires from the chronology of the facts of fixation of the amount of house allowance that before 1990 when there was only 20-30 High Court Judges, there was hardly any shortage of bungalow type houses for the Judges and the provision regarding payment of money as was fixed as house allowance before 1990 was not so unreasonable as it stands today.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, we declare the second part of Section 4(1)(a) of the Supreme Court Judges (Remuneration and Privileges) Ordinance, 1978 in the language of <em>“ .......and until such residence is provided, a judge shall be paid a residence allowance of Taka, 26,600/- per month” </em>void for being the same ultravires of  Article 27, 29, 31 and 147(2) of our Constitution.<br/> <br/>It, thus, emerges from the discussions and observations made hereinbefore as well as from the mandates of the Constitution and other laws of the land that all the three Rules are destined to be made absolute.<br/> <br/>Before we part with this judgment, we wish to quote the last Para of the case of Sayeda Rizwanna Hasan Vs Bangladesh reported in 18 BLC (AD) 54 which reads as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“<em>Courts have always been considered to have an overriding duty to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice-often referred to as the duty to vindicate and uphold the majesty of law. Due administration of justice has always been viewed as a continuous process, not confined to determination of the particular case, protecting its ability to function as a court of law in the future as in the case before it. Doing justice is the paramount consideration and that duty cannot be abdicated or diluted by reason of improper application. It is recognized in the public interest that the authority acting by virtue of statutory powers cannot exceed his authority’’</em>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Having been enlightened by the <em>ratio decidendi</em> of the above case, we feel it appropriate to make some directions in this case upon the concerned authorities in order to ensure that the painstaking efforts of the petitioners do not go in vain. As in the case above, we make the following directions upon the respondents and others authorities;</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Respondent nos. 1 and 2 are directed to vacate all the bungalow type houses which are being occupied by the persons below the serial 9 of the Warrant of Precedence within thirty days from the date of receipt of this judgment and order and allot the same to the dignitaries positioned above serial No.16 of the Warrant of Precedence as per their exigencies as may be ascertained from the date of receiving their applications taking an exception to the case of Mr. Justice Md. Jahangir Hossain for being recom-mended by the Hon’ble President of the Republic.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Since it is apparent that there is an acute shortage of bungalow type of houses and superior type flats and the respondents previously have not hired required number of flats/houses of 4,200 square feet (the size of flats which are being constructed for the Judges) to house the Supreme Court Judges temporarily until completion of the project of construction of 76 flats of 4,200 square feet for the Judges, therefore, in order to cope with the prevailing situation, respondent nos. 1 and 2 are further directed to hire the required number of flats/houses of 4,200 square feet  within the secured residential areas such as, Kakrial, Siddheshwari, Bailey Road, Eskaton Road, Dhanmondi, Gulshan, Banani and Baridhara and thereby allot the same in favour of the Judges of the Supreme Court at their earliest convenience.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the event that the Government wishes to replace the impugned part of Section 4(1) (a) of the Ordinance, 1978, “<strong>The Committee on Pay and Privilege of the Judges of the Supreme Court</strong>” should be made a perpetual statutory body, which must be constituted consisting of (i) Auditor &amp; Comptroller General of Bangladesh, (ii) Secretary, Ministry of Finance (iii) Secretary, Ministry of Law and Justice, (iv) Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Works, (v) Registrar of the Supreme Court and (vi) the Chief Executives of both the Dhaka City Corporations. They will sit at least twice a year and the duty of the said Committee will be, among others, to approve the rent agreements of the non-allottee Judges with their landlords, to assess and approve the rental value of their property as claimed by the Judges who live in their own houses/flats upon submission of a written letter/invoice by the concerned judges and to okay the service charges, bills of electricity, gas and water incurred. The rough draft of the proposed law in the sum and substance may be in the following language: <em>and until such residence is provided, a Judge of the Supreme Court shall be paid a monthly residence allowance of an amount of Taka as agreed with the land lord or the rental value of the properties of the Judges who live in their own properties and the bills of electricity, gas, water and service charges at actual under the approval of the “Committee on Pay and Privilege of the Supreme Court Judges”.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;">Until the required number of superior types of flats are hired for the Supreme Court Judges or the second part of Section 4(1)(a) of the Ordinance, 1978 is reenacted in the light and form of the above Direction no. 3, the non-allottee Judges shall be entitled to claim their house allowance at actual, which will include their respective house rent as per their respective rent agreement with their landlords, service charges and bills of electricity, gas and water. Their invoices and vouchers would be submitted through the Registrar of the Supreme Court to the Auditor and Comptroller General of Bangladesh who, upon making an assessment on the prevailing costs of house rents together with bills and charges with assistance from the Dhaka City Corporations (South and North), will approve the same.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the absence of the aforesaid statutory Committee, for the Judges who live in their own properties the residence allowance should be fixed by the judges themselves in collaboration with the Dhaka City Corporation and concerned Ward Councilor. The maximum claimed allowance would be equivalent to the rent of a house of 4200 square feet in their respective areas together with all charges and bills at actual. After verifying the assessment of the house rent by the Dhaka City Corporation, the invoice of the rental value of the property together with charges and bills may be submitted through the Registrar of the Supreme Court to the Office of the Auditor and Comptroller General for his approval.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The respondents are directed to comply with the aforesaid directions within one month from the date of receipt of this order and file affidavit of compliance before this Court within one week of the said compliance. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">With the above directions all the three Rules are made absolute.<br/> <br/>The Office is directed to send a copy of this judgment and order to (i) the Auditor and Comptroller General of Bangladesh, (ii) the Secretary, Cabinet Division, (iii) the Secretary, Ministry of Finance, (iv) the Secretary, Ministry of law and justice (v) the Registrar of the Supreme Court and (vi) the Chief Executives of both the City Corporations of Dhaka in order to apprise them with their duties and responsibilities which have been conferred upon them by the above directions of this Judgment and order and, thereby, to enable them to comply with these directions.<br/> <br/>There will, however, be no order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Moazzam Husain, J</u></strong><strong><u>:</u></strong></span><br/><br/>This appeal at the instance of the defendant No.1 is directed against the judgment and decree dated 24.8.1999 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Pirojpur, in Title Suit No.17 of 1998.<br/><br/>The facts as set out in the plaint, in short, are that 4˙76 acre of land described in Ka schedule of the plaint originally belonged to one Rajkamol Shill and Brindabon Shill in equal shares. Rajkamol Shill died leaving two sons, Lolit Kumar Shill and Rajmohon Shill. Brindabon Shill died leaving one son, Kalinath Shill. Lolit Kumar Shill died childless leaving his wife Kumudini Shill (Defendant-2).  Rajmohon Shill died leaving two sons, Sharot Chandra Shill and Shashi Kumar Shill. Sharat Chandra Shill died leaving two sons, Hemonta Kumar Shill (plaintiff) and Surendra Nath Shill. Shashi Kumar Shill died leaving three sons, Anil Kumar Shill, Amulya Kumar Shill and Adhir Kumar Shill.  SA record stands in the names of Kalinath Shill, Surendra Nath Shill, Hemanta Kumar Shill, Anil Kumar Shill, Amulya Kumar Shill and Adhir Kumar Shill in different shares and in the name of Kumudini Shill in ¼ shares.  Anil, Amulya and Adhir Kumar Shill having died unmarried their shares in the property devolved upon the plaintiff. As per her ¼ share in the property Kumudini Shill possessed 1˙19 acre land which she took out of plot Nos.353, 355,356 and 359 by family arrangement as described in schedule Kha of the plaint. Kumudini Shill inherited the land from her late husband and thus she held the same in life-interest. The plaintiff is the grandson of the brother of Lolit Kumar and happens to be the nearest heir of the last full owner, ie, Lolit Kumar. His interest is expectant upon the death of Kumudini Shill, the limited heir now in possession.<br/><br/>After the death of Lolit Kumar Shill the plaintiff, Amulya and Kumudini jointly sold ˙21½ acre land from the suit plots, collected money and performed various religious rituals, including, <em>Shradhya</em> ceremony, Brahmin-feast, <em>Chandipath</em>, offering <em>pinda</em> at Goya etc. for salvation of the departed soul of Lalit Kumar.  The defendant No.2, as wife of Lalit Kumar Shill, therefore, had no more obligations so to do for the same purpose. Defendant No.2, nonetheless, sold ˙34 acre land to one Abdul Khaleque by a deed dated 18.9.1975. Present plaintiff (Respondent) filed Title Suit No.23 of 1987 against defendant No.2 and two other persons for permanent injunction. Defendant No.2 was found by the court to have life estate in the land sold and accordingly was adjudged not competent to sell the same except for legal necessity.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the verdict of the court to the contrary defendant No.2 kept her design alive and finally executed in secret and behind the back of the plaintiff three sale deeds dated 11.6.1990, 29.9.1992, and 24.11.1996 purportedly transferring <em>˙60 </em>acre land from the suit plots to defendant No.1, i.e., the appellant.<br/><br/>Plaintiff came to know about the sale on 14.3.1997 when the defendant No.1 expressly claimed title to the suit land. The plaintiff on search initially found out two deeds, took certified copies of them and filed Title Suit No. 12 of 1997 seeking relief as against them. During pendency of the suit the defendant disclosed about the third deed which finally led to filing of the present suit for declaration, <em>inter alia,</em> that all the three deeds are void not binding upon him and no title is created in favour of the defendant No.1 by virtue of the deeds.<br/><br/>The defendant No.1 (Appellant) contested the suit by filing a written statement wherein he denied all the material allegations made in the plaint.   The case of the contesting defendant is apparently multi-directional. First line of his defense is that the suit land was not inherited by Kumudini (Defendant No. 2), his vendor, from her husband or any one else. It was her self-acquired property as such <em>stridhana</em>. The claim that the land was <em>stridhana</em> is testified by the fact that RS record was prepared in the name of Kumudini during life-time of her husband Lolit Kumar Shill. Subsequently SA record was also prepared in her name. Another fact that testifies the case of self-acquisition is that the plaintiff, Amulya and Kumudini jointly sold a piece of land from the suit plots to one Abdul Kader and Abdul Zabbar in 1956 which amounted to admission of absolute title of their vendor (Defendant No.2) in the suit land.  The second line of defense sought to be introduced during trial is that the land originally belonged to Lolit Kumar but he gifted the land to his wife Kumudini pursuant to a condition imposed by her father. The precondition imposed by the father of Kumudini was that unless Lolit had agreed to make a gift of a piece of land to his daughter he would not give his daughter in marriage with him. The third line is that Rajkamol and Brindabon did not belong to same family far less being full brothers.  The plaintiff having claimed his descent from Brindabon, stands beyond blood relation of Loit Kumar Shill and, therefore, does not come within the line of his heirs. By the same token the plaintiff is not the successor to the estate of Anil, Amulya and Adhir as reversioner.<br/><br/>The case set out by way of justification for sale, in brief, is that husband of defendant No. 2 suffered protracted illness and finally died. For the treatment of her husband and maintenance of her family she collected money by mortgaging portions of the land.  She plunged into debt after performing funeral, <em>shradhya</em> ceremony and other rituals conduce to the bliss of her husband’s soul. Moreover, for meeting the expenses of her family, medical treatment, payment of rent etc., she had to sell ˙34 acre land (no date mentioned) to one Abdul Khalque.<br/><br/>Successive crop failures over the years and damage of crops by excessive rainfall dragged the Defendant No. 2 into financial constraint. Meanwhile she became bed-ridden being attacked with paralysis. She was in need of money for maintenance of her family, payment of rent, treatment and religious ceremonies for spiritual benefit of her late husband. Being thus in need of money defendant No. 2 sold ˙19 acre land from the suit plots to defendant No.1 by executing a registered deed dated 11.6.1990 on a consideration of Tk. 50,000/-.<br/><br/>Defendant No. 2 has always been keenly disposed to salvation of the departed soul of her husband. With that end in view she annually arranges religious ceremonies, namely, feasts for Brahmins and relatives; organizing <em>kirtan</em>, congregations for recitations from <em>Chandi</em> and <em>Ramayana</em>.  Apart from that she used to go to India to pay occasional visits to Gaya, Kashi and other holy places for praying in aid the blessings of gods for her husband’s soul. She also used to visit different <em>Kali Mondir</em> and <em>Asram</em> of this country in pursuit of his spiritual benefit.<br/><br/>Defendant No.2 again felt called to perform religious rituals for the spiritual benefit of her husband, including,   offering <em>pinda</em> at Gaya, pilgrimage to holy places and building <em>moth</em> at the <em>samadhi</em> site etc, and thus being in need of money sold ˙16 acre land to the defendant No. 1 by executing a registered deed dated 29.9.1992 at a consideration of Tk.30, 000/-.  Defendant No. 2 in addition, arranged feast for 500 people on the date of her husband’s death. Besides the feast defendant No.2 organized yearly <em>kirtan</em> and recitation from <em>Geeta. </em> Thereafter she went to India in the month of <em>Agrahayan</em> of 1399 BS for visiting Gaya and Kashi for offerings before deities-all dedicated to the salvation of her husband’s soul.<br/><br/>The defendant No.2 in order to meet family expenses and expenses for treatment of her high blood pressure and paralysis and to bear the expenses of annual religious rituals for her husband including feast for Brahmins and organizing <em>kirtan</em>, recitations from Chandi and Bhagwabath Geeta fell in need of money. She offered ˙25 acre land for sale from the suit plots. Defendant No.1 again agreed to the offer and purchased the land at a consideration of Tk. 70,000/-by a registered sale deed dated 24.11.1996 and took over possession thereof. Defendant No. 2 spent the money, as she did earlier, on her treatment, maintenance of family and on arranging different religious ceremonies for the spiritual benefit of her husband<strong>.</strong><br/><br/>The defendant No.1 thus purchased in total ˙60 acre land from the suit plots by three registered sale deeds and has possessed the land ever since by effecting mutation and payment of rent to the government. The plaintiff has brought the suit on false and fictitious story.  The suit, therefore, is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>Learned Subordinate judge upon trial found the defendant No.2 to have inherited the land from her husband thus posted with limited interest in the suit land. She as a limited heir holding life-estate is not competent to sell the land except for legal necessity. Major part of the sale was found by the trial court as not made for legal necessity and accordingly the suit was decreed in part.<br/><br/>Mr. Abdul Quayum, learned Advocate appearing for the appellant submits that the land is self-acquired by Kumudini Shill and as such the same is her <em>stridhana </em>in which she enjoys absolute and unqualified right and title including the right to sell at her pleasure.  In his bid to bring home the point Mr. Quayum referred to RS khatian of the land standing in the name of defendant No.2 which he claims to have been prepared during life-time of her husband.   The fact that the RS and SA khatians stand in her name, he contended, goes to show that the land sold was her <em>stridhana</em> not widow’s estate so as to revert back to the reversioner. He sought to buttress up his point by reference to the fact that a portion of land from the suit plots was admittedly sold by the plaintiff jointly with Kumudini and Amulya for meeting expenses of funeral and <em>shradhya </em>ceremonies of Lolit Kumar. This, he argued, is tantamount to admission that the Kumudini held absolute title in the suit land and she was legally competent to dispose of the land by sale. He finally submits that the recitals in the sale deeds also lend support to the case that the land sold was <em>stridhana</em> of the vendor, not inherited by her from her husband.<br/><br/>Mr. S.N. Goswami, learned Advocate appearing for the respondent contended that the facts and evidence on records closely considered lead to the single conclusion that the suit land was inherited by defendant No. 2 from her deceased husband and she held the same in limited interest and that the plaintiff is the next reversioner of Lolit Kumar the last full owner of the suit land. It is also proved, he insisted, on convincing evidence that the suit land is sold with the primary intention of depriving the respondent, the next reversioner. He further submitted that there is an earlier decree against the defendant No.2 passed in a suit for permanent injunction filed by the respondent, restraining her from disposing of the land on the ground that she took only limited estate in the suit land. Subsequently in the instant suit another court of original jurisdiction again adjudged the defendant No.2 as a limited owner of the suit land and found her not competent to transfer the same except for legal necessity. Mr. Goswami submits that the plaintiff has proved by preponderant evidence that he is the nearest reversioner of late Lolit Kumar and his interest in the suit land is expectant upon the death of Kumudini Shill who inherited the same  from her husband and thus obviously held the land in limited interest.<br/><br/>Mr. Goswami pointed out that the appellant tried to introduce a story of gift at the trial which is nowhere to be found in his pleadings. The genealogy of the Shill family given by the respondent goes unassailed. He argued with emphasis that the suit land is nothing but portion of the land appertaining to khatian No. 185 admittedly belonging to different members of the Shill family of which husband of defendant No.2, Lolit Kumar Shill, is one. Defendant No.2 is married into the family and her source of ownership to the property can only be attributable to her husband unless otherwise proved. But nothing is proved to the contrary. Mr. Goswami finally submits that the decree passed by the trial court is well founded in law and on facts and there is no cogent ground so as to justify interference by this court in appeal.<br/><br/>Two witnesses were examined on behalf of the plaintiff and three on behalf of the defendants. Plaintiff himself was examined as PW-1. He stated on oath that the land in suit khatian originally belonged to Rajkomol and Brindabon Shill. He has put in the genealogy of the Shill family and claimed his descent from Rajkomol Shill. He established that Rajkomol Shill had two sons, namely, Lalit Kumar Shill and Rajmohon Shill. Kumudini Shill is the widow of Lolit Kumar Shill while he (plaintiff) is the grandson of Rajmohon Shill. He also stated that he succeeded to the estate of three sons of Shashi Kumar Shill as their cousin. He claimed that he is the nearest reversioner of Lolit Kumar Shill. His specific case   is that Kumudini Shill inherited the land from her husband and took limited estate in the property. She is not entitled to sell the land except for legal necessity but she surreptitiously sold the land without such necessity.<br/><br/>Earlier in 1975 defendant No. 2 took an attempt to sell out certain portion of the land and the plaintiff prevented the same through intervention of the court and got a decree as mentioned above. PW.1 stated that Lolit Kumar died 50/60 years ago and they performed funeral and <em>shradhya</em> ceremonies. With that end in view he along with his cousin Amulya and aunt Kumudini (defendant. 2) jointly sold a portion of land out of the suit plots to bear the expenses. The deeds executed by defendant No.2 in favour of defendant No.1 are void and not binding upon him.<br/><br/>PW.2 Keshab Lal Das is a next door neighbor of the plaintiff and known to both plaintiff and defendant No.2. He said that Kumudini did nothing towards spiritual benefit of her deceased husband within 15/20 years after his death. To quote his words:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">২ নং বিবাদী তাহার স্বামী মারা যাওয়ার পর তার ১৫/২০ বৎসরের মধ্যে তাহারা আত্মার সদ্গতির জন্য কোন  কিছু করে নাই।  ইহা সত্য নয় যে এক বৎসর আগে কুমুদিনীর বাড়ীতে রামায়ন পাঠ হয়|</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>DW.1, (Appellant) who is the vendee of the deeds and the contesting defendant admits the factum of purchase from defendant No.2 by three registered deeds.  But his case is that the land was self-acquired by defendant No.2 not inherited from her husband, therefore, the same was her <em>stridhana</em>. She sold the land for performing yearly <em>shradhya</em> ceremony, offering <em>pinda</em> at Gaya, paying debt etc. Though the question of self-acquisition for that matter ‘<em>stridhana’ </em>is the crux of the defendant’s case he failed to bring home the point by evidence worth consideration. He asserted that the plaintiff is not anyone in the line of heirs of the last full owner of the land. But in his cross-examination he admitted that plaintiff belongs to the family of Lolit Kumar Shill. To quote his words:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">স্বামীর মৃত্যুর পর হইতে কুমুদিনী স্বামীগৃহে বসবাস করিয়া অসিতেছেন। ভ্রাতুষ্পুণ শরৎ ও শশী তাহার দেখাশুনা করে। বাদী হেমন্ত উক্ত শরতের পুত্র.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Defendant No.2 Kumudini Shill herself was examined as DW.2. She tried to establish that she sold her own property not the property of her husband saying, <em>inter alia</em>, -‘I have sold my own property not the property of my husband’. Her words are apparently vague in that the words- ‘I have sold my own property’ do not necessarily mean that the property sold was her <em>stridhana </em>in that <em>stridhana </em>is a highly technical word used strictly in technical sense.  Even if the words are construed to mean <em>stridhana</em> there must be some evidence on records which in the circumstances of the case, must lead to the inference that the property was received or acquired by her in a manner which may constitute <em>stridhana.  </em>There is none except two records of rights standing in the name of Kumudini and the factum of joint sale for <em>stridhana </em>to stand on. The question would be addressed at an appropriate stage of our judgment.<br/><br/>Taking cue from DW.1 Kumudini Shill also made an attempt at introducing a case closer to ‘gift’ and said in her deposition that her father gave her in marriage to  Lolit Kumar on condition that Lolit would give her some land in writing but before doing so he died. Back to her words:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">ললিত কুমারের নিকট  আমার পিতা  আমাকে বিবাহ দিয়াছিল এই্ শর্তে যে ললিত কুমার আমাকে সম্পত্তি লিখিয়া দিবে।  লিখিয়া দেওয়ার পূর্বেই ললিত কুমার মারা যায়। ”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Nothing remains of ‘gift’ after such a statement made by Kumudini, the alleged donee herself.<br/><br/>Amid the toil and wrangling on gift one curious question looms large, that is, whether or not a gift of immoveable property made by husband constitutes <em>stridhana</em> according to <em>Dayabhaga</em> or Bengal school.  The view of Jimutavahana represented by   <em>Dayabhaga</em> School possibly resolves the issue. According to Dayabhaga School:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>‘…all gifts from relations constitute <em>stridhana</em>, except a gift of immoveable property  made by the husband; and that gifts from strangers also constitute <em>stridhana</em> if made before the nuptial fire or at the bridal procession.’ (<em>Quoted from Mulla Principles of Hindu Law, 15<sup>th</sup> Ed by ST Desai p.189)</em>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It follows, therefore, that gift of immov-able property by the husband, according to Dayabhaga law, does not constitute <em>stridhana</em>. The defendant’s case of gift, therefore, falls through as a matter of law rendering the factual attempt at proving it without any consequence<strong>. </strong><br/><br/>So far as the question of identity of the plaintiff<em> is </em>concerned DW.2 like DW.1 admitted that she and plaintiff live in one house and plaintiff stands to her as her grandson.  As she said: আমি ও বাদী য়েল¿গ্গ একই বাড়িতে থাকি। বাদী আমার নাতি হয়|Ó   The case of the plaintiff as to his identity, therefore, stands established by the admissions of both DW.1 and DW.2. The plaintiff virtually emerges as one in the line of heirs of deceased Lolit Kumar. It is not also denied by the defendants that he is the nearest reversioner of Lolit Kumar Shill.<br/><br/>DW.3, a co-villager of the plaintiff deposed in support of the possession of the defendant No.1. He said that defendant No.2 has been performing religious rituals ever since her husband’s death. He did not say anything about the alleged self-acquisition of the suit land by defendant No.2 or about the relation-ship of the plaintiff with Lolit Kumar Shill.<br/><br/>In view of the facts and evidence on records it may fairly be concluded that the respondent is a member of the Shill family and is the nearest heir of deceased Lolit Kumar Shill, the last full owner of the land sold. Respondent’s case on this point is established by his own statement on oath and reaffirmed by the admissions made by the DWs in court.  It is also proved by the respondent that the land sold is a portion of the ancestral property of the Shill family and admittedly the vendor is the widow of late Lolit Kumar Shill.  Respondent’s clear case is that defendant No. 2 inherited the land from her husband. The appellant (contesting defendant), though denied acquisition by inheritance, has miserably failed to press home his own case by cogent evidence oral or documentary. Moreover, he appears to have taken multi-dimensional defenses going beyond his pleadings which again were contradicted by his own witness as is discussed above.<br/><br/>Back to the crucial question of record of rights and the joint sale.  Mr. Quayum seems to have placed a good deal of emphasis on the fact that the RS and SA records stand in the name of Kumudini  as well as on the joint sale of a piece of land from the suit plots with Kumudini and Amulya. The point he seeks to canvass is that the RoR standing in the name of Kumudini and the joint sale of land with her by the respondent amply suggest that the suit land is <em>stridhana</em> of Kumudini not inherited from her husband. He sought to buttress up his point submitting that the RS record was prepared in the name of Kumudini during the lifetime of her husband which clearly raises a presumption in favour of <em>stridhana</em> and further strengthens the case of the appellant.  The trial court, he stressed, committed an error of law having failed to take into notice such a decisive piece of evidence. We are not persuaded to agree with Mr. Quayum for the precise reason that the revenue records of the government by its nature does not squarely correspond to the  intricacies and peculiarities of  title of a person attached to a piece of land.  For the purpose of revenue records one is not required to lay bare all the details relatable to title. Apparent interest in the land either as a proprietor, tenure-holder, <em>raiyat</em>, under <em>raiyat</em>, even possession as an occupant may form sufficient basis for preparation of record of rights.<br/><br/>It is a settled position of law that a widow as a limited heir is not a mere tenant-for-life, but is owner of the property inherited by her, subject to certain restrictions on alienation. The whole estate is vested in her for life and she represents it completely and her position is that of an owner. So long as she is alive no one has a vested interest in the succession. It is similar in incidents to an absolute estate. As long as a Hindu woman is found in possession of a piece of land either taken by her as life estate or as absolute interest she remains to be the owner of the land. In the circumstances, preparation of record of rights in her name remains to be a matter of course.  It has nothing to do with the nature of her title to the land, limited or absolute. Nor such record of rights <em>per se</em> raises any presumption in favour of <em>stridhana</em>.<br/><br/>Over and above Mr. Quayum appears to be factually wrong in that the defendant No.2 herself as DW.2 stated in clear terms that the land was  recorded  in  her name  after  death of her husband. Her own words read  as  follows: "স্বামীর  মৃত্যুর  পর  আমার  নামে  রেকর্ড হয়|<strong>" </strong>The appellant himself  also  did  not stick to the point and said nothing on oath about the timing of preparation of R.S. record. Be that as it may, our view is that record of rights standing in the name of the widow even if found to have been prepared during lifetime of her husband, does not <em>ipso</em> <em>facto</em> raise any presumption in favour of <em>stridhana</em>.<br/><br/>As for the joint-sale Mr. Quayum submits that the joint sale of a portion of land by the plaintiff, his cousin Amulya and the defendant No.2 amounts to admission of her absolute interest in the suit property. We are again unable to accept the contention, firstly because, we do not find any reason why a Hindu widow should be unable to join other co-sharers or next reversioner in transferring her life-estate or portion thereof for her legal necessity. Secondly, such transfer, if any, speaks more in favour of her limited estate than in favour of absolute title in the property in that joining the reversioners for sale of property held in absolute interest is more unlikely.  And finally, in the face of the credible and convincing evidence prevailing in favour of the plaintiff’s case and apparent failure of the defendants to outweigh the same by any evidence to the contrary mere joint sale cuts no ice either in terms of law or of facts.<br/><br/>Now the question we are left with is that given the fact that the land sold by defendant No.2 was inherited by her from her deceased husband and she took life estate in the same whether it can be said that the transfers made were made for legal necessity. Defendant No.2 inherited <span dir="RTL">۠</span>1.19 acre land from her husband. Back in 1956 she sold jointly with the plaintiff and Amulya ˙21½ acre land for meeting expenses of funeral and <em>shradhya</em> ceremony of her deceased husband. Admittedly she later sold .34 acre land to one Abdul Khaleque which was prevented by intervention of court at the instance of the present appellant. In 1990 defendant No. 2 sold ˙19 acre land at Tk. 50,000/-. Thereafter in 1992 she sold ˙16 acre land at Tk.30, 000/- and finally in 1996 she sold ˙25 acre land at Tk. 70,000/-. In all the three sale deeds (Ext.1, 1Ka &amp; 1Kha) under challenge the necessities for sale as set out are (with little variations) as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>..এই্ক্ষণে পরলোকগত স্বামীর পারলৌকিক কার্যের  জন্য গঙ্গায় পিন্ডদান ও আমার তীর্থ ভ্রমন করার জন্য গয়া কাশি প্রভৃতি নানা স্থানে গমন ও স্বামীর সমাধিস্থলে মঠ তৈরি ও আমার খোরাক পোষাক প্রভৃতি কার্যের  জন্য এছাড়া সাংসারিক নানাবিধ কারণে বহু টাকার আবশ্যক বিধায় আমি আমার নিজ রেকর্ডীঁ ভোগদখলীয় সম্পত্তি ছাপ বিণিক্ষ্ম করার প্রদ্মগ্গবয ঘোষনা করায় আপনি…..</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the fitness of things a piece of statement of DW.1 (Appellant) made in cross examination needs be quoted:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>‘বিবাহকালে কুমুদিনীর বয়স ছিল ১০ বৎসর। বিবাহের দেড় বছর পর স্বামী ললিত কুমার মারা যায়। অবমলবব ৬৮ বৎসর পূর্বে।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The above statement of DW.1 made during trial (held in late 1999) shows that Kumudini was married at the age of 10 and lost her husband only 1½ years thereafter and her husband died 68 years ago. PW.1 (Respondent) on the other hand stated that Lolit died 50/60 years ago. The joint sale appears to have been made in 1956 allegedly for meeting expenses of <em>sradhya</em> etc. of Lolit. It is fairly deducible from the above evidence on records that Lolit died in mid-fifties. <br/><br/>The three deeds under challenge were executed by the defendant No.2 from 1990 onward and completed within 1996. Defendant No.2 is admittedly childless. In addition to her disposal made twice earlier the disputed deeds seeking to dispose of total <strong><sup>.</sup></strong>60 acre land thereby collecting Tk. 50000+30000+70000= 1, 50,000/- within such a short span of time  assumes an apparent look of liquidation-sale for depriving the next reversioner of her husband.<br/><br/>Husband of defendant No.2 died long 55 (approximate) years ago when she was a girl of 12 years only (<em>per</em> PW.1). That means she lost her husband before true attachment between them could grow.  Her age and maturity at the time of her husband’s death do not go with the case of the appellant that the youthful widow was extremely dedicated to her husband and did everything possible for recovery of her ailing husband. It is also unusual for a girl of 12 years that she had plunged into debt for her husband and mortgaged some land. It is also incompatible with her age that she again fell in need of money for her own treatment, payment of rent and maintenance of her family which led her to sell 34 decimal land to one Abdul Khaleque.  The story of transferring the land to Abdul Khaleque, moreover, is factually incorrect in that the deed of Abdul Khaleque was executed in 1975, long after the death of her husband in mid- fifties which is too remote to relate the necessities for sale alleged.<br/><br/>By the same token it is also unbelievable that Kumudini, poor widow as she was,  had been performing various religious ceremonies every year which includes pilgrimage to holy places, offering <em>pinda</em> at Gaya, building <em>moth</em> at the <em>samadhi</em> site of her husband, offering feasts to Brahmins and relatives arranging <em>kirtan</em>, <em>chandipath</em> and recitations from Bhgwabath Geeta etc. all the above expensive religious ceremonies observed  every year by a widow of scant means stand in stark contrast with reality. It is equally unbelievable that with the little means she had she threw feast for 500 people in 1992. Moreover, the story of visiting Goya and Kashi by Kumudini, being herself an old woman of above 70 years at the material time and a patient of acute paralysis is too difficult a pill to swallow. <br/><br/>No mathematical limit can be fixed to the power of alienation of a widow of her husband’s property for the purpose of religious acts which conduce to his spiritual benefit. The question whether the property dedicated or alienated constitutes a reasonable proportion of the whole estate is relevant. The limited owner must act with the best of motives and without extravagance.  Here in this case intention of sale does not appear to be <em>bona fide</em> and the wholesale transfer of life estate by the widow in the name of spiritual benefit of her deceased husband in disregard of her own survival does not appear to be proportionate from any point of view.<br/><br/>Learned Subordinate Judge, however, found one deed, i.e., deed of 1990 seeking to dispose of ˙16 acre land at Tk. 50,000/- to be executed for legal necessity and other two are not.  True it is that the case of the appellant as is pleaded cannot be measured on the scale of legal necessity. It cannot still be denied that the defendant No.2 is a poor widow left with the small parcel of land for her maintenance and all the incidental expenses of life. Respondent has not come with a case duly proven that defendant No.2 had other property to support her many different expenses at her old age. All the impractical and irrational excuses for sale apart, she needed money and the only source again remained to be the same small piece of land. We, therefore, agree with the learned Subordinate Judge to the extent that the land sold under the deed of 1990 was sold for legal necessity. But that does not mean that the disposal of almost the entire property on the excuses as were shown, by two subsequent deeds can be called disposal for legal necessity.<br/><br/>For the reasons stated above we find substance in the contention of Mr. Goswami that, in view of the facts and evidence on records there is no justifiable reasons for interference of the judgment and decree passed by the trial court. The appeal must, therefore, fail.<br/><br/>In the result, the appeal is dismissed without any order as to cost. The impugned judgment and part decree passed by the Subordinate Judge 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Pirojpur, is maintained.<br/><br/>Send down the lower court records at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

The petitioner on 23.6.2010 filed an application before Upazila Palli Unnayan Officer for yearly increment of Tk. 100/-. Upon such application the Upazila Palli Unnayan Officer issued a letter on 16.08.2010 asking the petitioner to submit her eight pass testimonial before the authority, though at the time of joining in the post the petitioner submitted eight pass testimonial issued on 12.3.2005 by Amada Maddomik Biddalaya authority. The petitioner gave details about submission of eight pass testimonial by a reply dated 13.02.2011 in response to show cause notice issued by the authority on 14.10.1010. But the respondent No. 4 all on a sudden by office memo No. 982 dated 18.4.2011 (Annexure-G) stopped her salary and restrained  from performing her office work with effect from April 2011 and the same respondent issued another office order under another memo using same memo number and date (i.e memo No. 982 dated 18.4.2011)  informing all concerned that he would not sign the salary sheet and cheque of the petitioner from April, 2011 ( Annexure G-1).<br/><br/>An inquiry was also held regarding the testimonial of the petitioner by forming an inquiry committee by the Amada Maddomik Biddaloya authority and after inquiry the committee found that the testimonial which has been submitted by the petitioner was correct and accordingly the committee  submitted a report on 03.05.2011 before the Head Master of the school and the Headmaster again issued a fresh certificate to the petitioner on the basis of the inquiry report and informed the matter to respondent No. 4 Upazila Palli Unnayan Officer, Lohagora, Narail by a representation dated 12.05.2011. The petitioner filed several representations on 9.5.2011, 11.5.2011 and 15.3.2012 by reference to inquiry report praying for withdrawal of the office orders dated 18.04.2011, payment of salaries and other benefits but the respondents did not pay heed to any of the applications. As a last resort the petitioner served a notice upon the respondents demanding justice through her engaged Advocate requesting them to withdraw /rescind the office orders dated 18.04.2011 but in vain. Having no other efficacious and alternative remedy available to the petitioner, she filed this application before this Division challenging the office orders dated 18.4.2011 and obtained the instant <em>rule.</em><br/><br/>Mr. Zahirul Alam Babar, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that the impugned orders are ex-facie <em>mala fide</em>, illegal and arbitrary inasmuch as without holding any inquiry regarding the testimonial of the petitioner and without giving any notice of being heard of the petitioner respondent No. 4 Upazila Polli Unnayan Officer stopped payment of salary and other benefits including official works of the petitioner and as such the impugned orders are no orders in the eye of law. Learned Advocate further submits that the impugned order containing in Annexure-A is neither a suspension order nor a dismissal order according to service rules and this type of order is unknown to law. He next submits that till date no departmental proceeding has been initiated against the petitioner nor any formal suspension order is passed. But she has been deprived of the subsistence allowance which she would have been entitled had she been formally suspended.  Learned Advocate finally submits that considering the facts and circumstances of the case this <em>rule</em> should be made absolute with a consequential relief directing the authority to reinstate the petitioner in her service and to pay all arrear salaries and other benefits payable to her  for end of justice.<br/><br/>Respondent No. 4 entered appearance through separate vokalatnama and filed an affidavit-in-opposition denying the allegations made in writ petition in their material particulars but no one appears to oppose the <em>rule</em> at the time of hearing.<br/><br/> However, we have gone through the affidavit-in-opposition submitted on behalf of respondent No. 4, where it has been asserted, inter alia, that the writ petition is not maintainable as the allegations involve disputed question of fact regarding the genuineness of the academic certificate of the petitioner. His positive case is that writ petitioner at the time of entering in the service as MLSS under BRDB submitted ‘class VIII pass certificate’ from Amada Maddhomik Biddalaya, Lohagora. Thereafter a question of genuineness of the certificate arose   and the respondent No.4 vide Memo. No. 541 dated 16.8.2010 asked for an explanation from the petitioner and the petitioner gave a reply on 13.2.2011 which was not satisfactory.  Moreover, in reply dated 30.10.2010 to letter dated 9.12.2010 sent by respondent No.4,  the Headmaster of   Amada Maddhomik Biddalaya  denied issuance of certificate in favour of the petitioner. Respondent No. 4 also formed  3(three) members inquiry committee on 31.01.2012 to inquire regarding the testimonial of the petitioner issued by Amada Maddomik Biddalaya pursuant to the decision taken by the executive committee of Lohagara U.C.C.A Limited on 26.01.2012. But the said committee submitted a report on 28.2.2012 stating that they were unable to inquire the matter as they faced pressure from various quarters.   <br/>We have heard the learned Advocate for the petitioner and perused the records of the case.<br/><br/>It is admitted that the petitioner joined in the service under BRDB as MLSS in the year 2005 and has been serving as such in the office of UCCA, Lohagora, Narail since the date of joining. It is the case of the petitioner that she was serving in the office of respondent No. 4 with full satisfaction of her higher authority but when she prayed for another increment in the year 2010, the respondent No. 4 for the first time raised the question of genuineness of her VIII pass testimonial filed at the time of joining in her service. The Headmaster of Amada Maddhomik Biddalaya on 30.12.2010 sent a letter to the respondent No.4 stating that there was no information about the petitioner in the school record and the certificate produced before him was not issued by the said school. Nearly four months thereafter, the respondent No. 4 all on a sudden issued the impugned order dated 18.4.2011 stopping payment of salary, other allowances and office duties as aforesaid. Office order dated 18.4.2011 is quoted verbatim below:</div><div style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: center;">“উপজেলা পল্লী উন্নয়ন অফিসারের কার্যালয়<br/>লোহাগড়া, ইউসিসিএ লিঃ<br/>লোহাগড়া, নড়াইল<br/>স্মারক নং- ৯৮২                                 তারিখঃ ১৮-৪-২০১১</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">অফিস আদেশ<br/>বিগত ১৩/০৪/২০১১ইং তারিখে অনুষ্ঠিত ইউসিসিএ লিঃ এর কার্যনির্বাহী পরিষদের ৬নং আলোচ্য সুচীর আলোচনায় সর্বসম্মত সিদ্ধান্ত মোতাবেক মোসাঃ রহিমা বেগম এম,এল,এস,এস/পিয়ন এর শিক্ষাগত যোগ্যতার সনদপএের বৈধতার বিষয়টি সুরাহা না হওয়া পর্যন্ত লোহাগড়া ইউসিসিএ লিঃ এ কর্মরত মোসাঃ রহিমা বেগম, এম,এল,এস,এস এর যাবতীয় অফিসিয়াল কার্যএ্রম এবং বেতন ভাতাদি স্থগিত থাকবে। এ আদেশ এপ্রিল/২০১১ মাস হতে কার্যকর হবে।  </div><div style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: right;">স্বাক্ষর অম্পষ্ট<br/>উপজেলা পল্লী উন্নয়ন অফিসার<br/>(বিআরডিবি)<br/>লোহাগড়া, ইউসিসিএ লিঃ ”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the meantime upon an application of the petitioner dated 27.5.2011 the managing committee of  Amada Maddomik Biddalaya decided to inquire about the genuineness of the certificate by forming a three members inquiry committee dated 30.4.2011, who after inquiry found that the petitioner was a student of Amada Maddomik Biddyalaoy and submitted a report on 3.5.2011 to that effect. As per said report the headmaster again issued a fresh testimonial and forwarded a letter to the respondent no.4 on 12.5.2011 explaining as to why he failed to give proper information earlier.<br/><br/>It also appears from the report of the inquiry committee dated 28.2.2012(Annexure-Uma) that after lapse of nine months from passing the impugn order the respondent No.4 formed a three- member inquiry committee on 31.1.2012 to inquire about the genuineness of the certificate of the petitioner but the said inquiry committee failed to submit any report stating that they had embarrassment to inquire into the matter and recommended to inquire by high officials of the department. But the respondent No.4 did not form any such inquiry committee till date.<br/><br/>A glance on the successive facts right from asking the petitioner to submit testimonial before paying increment down to the 28<sup>th</sup> day of February, 2010 i.e nine months from passing the impugned order suggests to our mind a number of landmarks in this case, namely, asking for filing “VIII-Pass Certificate” after five years of undeniably  satisfactory service; her written statement  that at the time of entry into service she submitted it;  at the instance of the respondents the petitioner’s school although primarily gave a negative reply but after thorough inquiry admitted the genuine-ness of the petitioner’s certificate and the headmaster also informed the respondent No.4 about the development expressing regret for the earlier negative report; several written requests thereafter made by the petitioner for withdrawal of the order stopping her salary etc.; merciless and unsparing attitude of the authority  to the requests; unanimous decision of the of  UCCA-Executive Committee to stop her salary and allowances;  formation  of a  three-member committee to inquire into the matter which, however, felt embarrassed; proposal for forming high power inquiry committee  and keeping the issue still alive, as appears from the affidavit-in-opposition.<br/><br/>The affidavit-in-opposition does not suggest that the UCCA and BRDB are corruption-free or effectively eradicated all sorts of corruption and misuse of official powers at higher levels and now taken up the agenda to clean up the bottom. Where unbridled corruption at the hierarchy has eaten up all our important state institutions and no effective measures could be taken against the evil we find no logic in declaring crusade against an MLSS who needs the job for bare survival not for pomp and grandeur in life  raising the trifling question of genuineness of her VIII-pass Certificate.<br/><br/>As the story goes, the petitioner entered the job producing all necessary papers including her ‘VIII- pass Certificate’ issued from a local school. Meanwhile five years of her satisfactory service had been completed.  After the question was raised, the headmaster informed the authority about the genuineness and issued a fresh certificate for the petitioner although primarily his sound was negative. Still the authority was not satisfied and seemingly could never be satisfied till her complete removal from the post. <br/><br/>The petitioner is none but a poor village woman and needs the job to ease her struggle for survival with her family not for making fortune.  If the VIII-pass certificate is so crucial for the job the question of its genuineness ought to have been settled as soon as possible after the completion of recruitment process. After an MLSS has been set in his/her job and starts to dream a life liveable as human the ruthless and unsparing attitude of the authority to find fault with the academic certificate and to remove the MLSS from his/her job is not in consonance with the purpose of law, justice or public policy. The UCCA authority has failed to notice that there is a marked difference between the job needed for survival and of persons holding responsible posts in the hierarchy. And for the precise reason the job of an MLSS, unlike others, is directly linked with his/her bread and butter loss of which directly affects his/her survival as human.<br/><br/>The authority is doubtlessly empowered to take action against anyone irrespective of status for the interest of the institution but in case of taking the job of a menial they must of necessity be the slowest and act under only painful necessity where no other alternative is available. If the service rendered by the MLSS is otherwise satisfactory and not detrimental to the interest of the institution concerned mere defect/ flaw of his/her academic records, not detected at the entry stage or soon thereafter, should not be the ground for her removal.<br/><br/>Back to the formal issue, it appears that the action taken by the authority is too harsh and drastic. More so, the nature of order stopping salary, allowances and keeping off the indicted employee from duty is unheard of and not known to law. Law provides entitlement of allowance to the   public servants or employees of other public bodies under suspension. Here the poor lady was deprived of everything. No norm of disciplinary action in passing the order has been followed.<br/><br/>Given the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that respondents trave-lled far beyond their jurisdiction in issuing the impugned orders dated 18.4.2011 (Annexure -G and G-1).<br/><br/>This <em>rule </em>merits consideration which should be made absolute with consequential relief.<br/><br/>In the result, the <em>rule </em>is made absolute, however, without any order as to costs. The two office orders bearing same memo No. 982 dated 18.4.2011 (Annexure-G and G-1) are declared to have been passed and issued without lawful authority and are of no legal effect. The respondents are directed to re-instate the petitioner in her service and to pay all arrear salaries and other service benefits from April 2011, within 2(two) weeks from the date of receipt of this judgment.<br/><br/>Communicate copies of the judgment at once.<br/><br/><strong>        Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Khatian No.189 and S.A. Khatian No.47, Poura Holding No.210/1, Bangabandhu Sarak, Police Station Narayangonj Sadar. The plaintiff contended, inter alia, that Harun Bepari was the owner and possessor of the said land and accordingly it was recorded in C.S. Khatian No.48 in his name; that said Harun Bepari published a public notice in the daily Ittefaq dated 07.01.1978 for selling the said land. Thereafter, the plaintiff purchased the said land by sub-kabala deed dated 23.01.1978 and acquired title in the “Ka” schedule land to the plaint, filled up the land with earth, constructed some structures upon the said land and let out the same to his sister, the defendant No.3 and started possessing the suit land and structure through tenants and also by himself. A dispute arose between the plaintiff and the defendant No.2 in respect of title of the suit land and the plaintiff instituted Title Suit No.174 of 1981. That suit was dismissed by judgement and decree dated 12.05.1983. Thereafter, the plaintiff purchased the suit land again from the defendants No.4 and 5 by two registered kabala deeds dated 06.06.1983 and 21.06.1983. The defendant No.3 entered into a portion of the suit premises on 01.07.1978 by executing an agreement and thereafter he refused to pay rent whereupon the plaintiff instituted SCC Suit No.28 of 1984 for evicting the defendant No.3. The plaintiff in the instant suit prayed for declaration of title to the “Ka” schedule land to the plaint and confirmation of possession of the “Kha” schedule structure on the suit land and recovery of khas possession to “Ga” schedule structure on the suit land.<br/><br/>The defendant No.2, Narayangonj Jila Parishad contested the suit by filing written statement denying the material allegations made in the plaint contending, inter alia, that the suit was not maintainable as it stands framed. It was claimed that  12 decimals of land out of the suit land was acquired by the Government vide LA. Case No. 1/30 of 1935-36 and thereafter .054 acre of land was acquired for the development of Dhaka-Narayangonj Road. Thereafter, the land was leased out by defendant No.2 to defendant No.3 who is in possession of the suit land. The plaintiff previously instituted two suits against the defendants, and having lost those has filed the instant suit. The plaintiff has no right, title, interest and possession in the suit property and there was no cause of action to file the suit and the suit was not maintainable in its present form and manner. Hence, the suit was liable to be dismissed.<br/>        <br/>The trial Court upon consideration of the evidence on record dismissed the suit by the judgement and decree dated 10.03.2003 holding the suit to be barred by res judicata.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the judgement and decree of the trial Court, the plaintiff preferred Title Appeal No.39 of 2003. The said appeal was heard by the Additional District Judge, First Court, Narayangonj, who by the judgement and decree dated 06.04.2004 allowed the appeal and decreed the suit upon setting aside the judgement and decree of the trial Court.<br/><br/>The defendant filed a civil revisional application before the High Court Division and obtained Rule. By the impugned judgement and order, the High Court Division made the Rule absolute and set aside the judgement and decree dated 06.04.2004 passed by the appellate Court thereby restored the judgement and decree of the trial Court. Hence, the plaintiff-petitioner herein has filed the instant Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal before this Division.<br/>     <br/>Mr. Muhammad Nawab Ali, the learned Advocate-on-Record appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that the High Court Division erred in reversing the reasoned judgement of the appellate Court. He further submits that the High Court Division did not consider the fact that L.A. Case No.  of 1935-36 acquired only .08 acres of land which was confirmed by local investigation report. As such the High Court Division erred in not decreeing the remainder of the suit land in favour of the petitioner. He lastly submits that the dismissal of the entire suit was therefore illegal and the judgement and order of the High Court Division is liable to be set aside. <br/><br/>Mrs. Sufia Khatun, the learned Advocate-on-Record appearing on behalf of the respondents made submissions in support of the impugned judgement and order passed by the High Court Division.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocate-on-Record for the parties concerned and perused the impugned judgement of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record.<br/><br/>We note from the impugned judgement and order of the High Court Division that observation was made to the effect that the earlier Title Suit No.174 of 1981 (marked as Ext.”Ka” in the suit) was also filed seeking a declaration of title in the suit land and structures raised upon holding No.210/1 of Narayangonj Municipality, Plot No. 28/961 corresponding to schedule-‘Ka’, ‘Kha’ and ‘Ga’ land of the plaint. It was further observed that the plaintiff of the earlier suit is the plaintiff of the instant suit. In the earlier suit the Zilla Board Narayangonj as defendant produced the order sheets of the aforementioned L.A. case marked as Exts. ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’ and gazette notification was marked as Ext.D. The trial Court in that suit came to a definite finding that the original owner received compensation in the said L.A. case and declared that no title passed in favour of the plaintiff on the strength of kobala deed dated 23.01.1978. No appeal was preferred against the dismissal of the said suit. The High Court Division also observed that the instant suit was filed on the strength of two subsequent kobala deeds dated 06.06.1983 and 21.06.1983 (Exts. 11 and 12) from Nazimuddin, son of late Abdul Gafur alleging the executant to be the grandson of Harun Bepari. The High Court Division observed that the compensation in L.A. Case No.  of 1935-36 was in the name of two sons of Harun Bepari, namely Sirajuddin and Tafizuddin and that fact was affirmed in the earlier title suit and therefore the plaintiff could not make out a case of alleged purchase from the heirs of Harun Bepari. The High Court Division observed that so long Ext. ‘Ka’ stands, the plaintiff is estopped from claiming any title in the suit land through the heirs of Harun Bepari inasmuch as in the previously instituted suit, the Court believed payment of compensation to the sons of Harun Bepari.<br/><br/>As the suit land is common in both Title Suit No.174 of 1981 as well as in the instant suit and the plaintiff claimed title through the heirs of Harun Bepari and since the earlier suit was dismissed on contest and the issue relating to right, title and possession is the same, the instant suit is clearly barred by the doctrine of a res judicata. <br/><br/>The High Court Division has given elaborate reasons for making the Rule absolute thereby upholding the judgement and decree of the trial Court.<br/><br/>We do not find any cause to interfere with the impugned judgement and order of the High Court Division.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.<br/><br/><strong>End.</strong></div></div></div>

Ltd. registered on 24.8.2000 as a Public Limited Company with the office of Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms having prior approval of the Government for the purpose of doing general insurance business. The said company was also registered with the Chief Controller of Insurance in the month of September, 2000. Plaintiff was the Managing Director of the said company from its inception and on 28.9.2000 the plaintiff got approval from the Chief Controller of Insurance. Plaintiff was serving in the defendants company from September, 2000 up to 5<sup>th</sup> July, 2004 and thereafter he left the insurance profession on 6<sup>th</sup> July, 2004. The Board of Directors of the Company made delay in fixing the remuneration of the plaintiff and after repeated requests the Board of Directors in its 26<sup>th</sup> meeting held on 15.3.2004 fixed the salary of the plaintiff @ Tk.40,000/- (forty thousand) only per month and house rent @ Tk.20,000/- (twenty thousand) only per month to be paid from September, 2000. On the basis of this fixation the total remuneration of the plaintiff from September, 2000 to 5<sup>th</sup> July, 2004 for 46 months 5 days stood Tk.27,69,676/- (twenty seven lac sixty nine thousand six hundred seventy six) only, out of that amount plaintiff received from the company at different times up to October, 2005 a total of Tk.21,17,826/- (twenty one lac seventeen thousand eight hundred twenty six) only as confirmed by the company by its letter dated 15<sup>th</sup> November, 2005. Thus the plaintiff is entitled to get Tk.27,69,676 –21,17,826 = Tk.6,51,850/- (six lac fifty one thousand eight hundred fifty) only as his arrear salary from the company. Plaintiff by his letter dated 12.01.2005 requested the defendant No. 2 (Managing Director) to pay his arrears, with copy of it to defendant No. 3 (Chairman of the company). In reply the defendant No. 2 by his letter dated 17<sup>th</sup> January, 2005 informed the plaintiff that the matter would be placed before the Board of Directors in its next meeting and to be intimated him of its decision in due course, but the defendant No. 2 did not respond to the request of the plaintiff. Plaintiff continued to write to defendant No. 2 in this regard with copy to defendant No. 3 and in reply to one of these letters dated 25.8.2005, the Assistant Secretary of the Company confirmed the plaintiff by his letter dated 29.8.2005 that the matter would be placed in the next Board Meeting of the Company and the decision of the Board of the Company would be informed to the plaintiff, but in vain. Plaintiff being dissatisfied with the above conduct of defendant No. 2 directly approached defendant No. 3 being the Chairman of the company by a letter dated 18.10.2005 requesting him to make payment of the entire dues by 25<sup>th</sup> October, 2005, because of his urgent need of money with copy of the letter to all Directors of the Company, but unfortunately the defendant No. 3 also kept silence and did not respond to the request of the plaintiff. Plaintiff finding no other alternative on 14.12.2005 served legal notice upon the defendant No. 2 demanding to pay his balance remuneration of Tk.6,51,850/- (six lac fifty one thousand eight hundred and fifty) only within 15 days from receipt of the legal notice. Defendant No. 2 received the notice on 15.12.2005, but has not yet complied with the demand of the plaintiff. Defendant No. 1 on 28.12.2005 replied to the notice of the plaintiff stating inter alia that the matter is still lying with the Board and as soon as the decision is taken by the Board the plaintiff be informed accordingly, but none of the defendants has taken any initiative to pay the arrears of the plaintiff till filing of the suit. Defendants with evil motive of harassing the plaintiff illegally holding up the payment of his dues causing great financial loss and mental suffering to him though the company has available means to make the payment and hence the suit.<br/><br/>The defendants entered appearance and contested the suit by filing a joint written statement denying the averments of the plaint stating inter alia that the suit is not maintainable in its present form, no cause of action to institute the suit, suit is barred by law of limitation and the suit is hit by principle of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence. The other averments of the defendants are that the plaintiff at a time was the Director and Managing Director of the defendant-company, but he did not disclose the same to the plaint. In the 26<sup>th</sup> meeting of Board of Directors held on 15.3.2004 there was specific 7 agenda, but no agenda of fixation of the remuneration of plaintiff was taken. Since the plaintiff was the Managing Director of the Company, by misusing the power fraudulently fixed his remuneration at Tk.40,000/- (forty thousand) only as basic salary and Tk.20,000/- (twenty thousand) only as house rent per month to be paid from the month of September, 2000 as arrear basis in the heading of miscellaneous agenda. Plaintiff intentionally has taken away his appointment letter from his personal file in his service period in an ill motive and he did not disclose the terms, conditions and remunerations of his appointment letter and did not write any letter to the Board of Directors as well as Controller of Insurance about his fixation of remuneration and as such the plaintiff is not entitled to get arrear salary as prayed for and hence the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>On the pleadings, the learned Joint District Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka framed as many as 4 (four) issues to determine the suit. Among them the principal issue was that whether the plaintiff is entitled to get a money decree as prayed for.<br/><br/>At the trial plaintiff examined himself as P.W. 1 and the defendants examined one witness as D.W. 1, besides the plaintiff exhibited a series of documents including the minutes of 26<sup>th</sup> meeting of Board of Directors of the defendants company held on 15.3.2004 which were marked as exhibits 1-9 in the suit.<br/><br/>The trial court on consideration of the material evidence on record placed before it, decreed the suit holding that the plaintiff has been able to prove the suit and the trial court also directed the defendants to make payment of Tk.6,51,850/- (six lac fifty one thousand eight hundred fifty) only to the plaintiff within 30 days, failing which the plaintiff would be entitled to realize the decreetal amount in accordance with law.<br/><br/>The unsuccessful defendants as appellants preferred the instant First Appeal being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the above judgment and decree dated 16.8.2011.<br/><br/>During pendency of this appeal the plaintiff-respondent also preferred a Memorandum of cross-objection invoking Order 41 Rule 22 of the Code of Civil Procedure which was registered as Civil Order No. 2 of 2012 seeking for interest at the rate of 15% per annum on the decreetal amount to mitigate his mental and financial sufferings caused by the irresponsible act of the defendant-appellants.<br/><br/>Eventually, the plaintiff put the decree into execution through Money Execution Case No. 5 of 2011 before the court of Joint District Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka for realization of the decreetal amount and the appellants as petitioners by filing an application prayed for staying operation of the said execution proceedings and a separate Rule being Civil Rule No. 171(F) of 2012 was issued on 28.2.2012 by this Court. By the aforesaid Rule issuing order dated 28.2.2012 further proceedings of Money Execution Case No. 5 of 2011 of the Court of Joint District Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka was stayed till disposal of the instant First Appeal subject to payment of Tk.1,00,000/- (one lac) only from the decreetal amount to the plaintiff.<br/><br/>Mr. Mahabub Ali, the learned Advocate appearing with Mr. Sagir Anowar and Mr. Mahbubur Rahman on behalf of the appellants having placed the impugned judgment and other materials on record submits that the trial court below committed error of law and facts and without applying its judicial mind passed the impugned judgment and thereby decreed the suit which is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate for the appellants submits further that the trial court failed to consider the minutes of 26<sup>th</sup> Board Meeting of the Company that there was no agenda for fixation of remuneration of the plaintiff and the plaintiff being the then Managing Director of the Company fraudulently noted his salary and other facilities with retrospective effect in the heading of miscellaneous agenda and as such the impugned judgment and decree of the trial court below should be set aside.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate for the appellants lastly submits that the trial court failed to consider a circular date 18.7.2001 issued by the Insurance Directorate, People’s Republic of Bangladesh in which qualification of Managing Director of an Insurance Company was embodied and the Managing Director must have aged between 40 to 65 and in the instant case the age of the plaintiff was about 70 years at the relevant time and he was not  legally entitled to hold the post of Managing Director of the defendants-company, thus he is not entitled to get benefit as a Managing Director of the Company.<br/><br/>Mr. Mohammad Golam Kibria, the respondent appearing in person, on the other hand having supported the judgment and decree of the trial court below and having placed other materials on record particularly minutes of 26<sup>th</sup> Board Meeting of the Company (exhibit-1) submits that he served as the Managing Director of the defendant-company from its inception and no salary for him was fixed, upon repeated request, in the 26<sup>th</sup> Meeting of Board of Directors the salary and the house rent of the plaintiff were settled with retrospective effect and the trial court having considered all the exhibited documents produced before him has rightly arrived at a finding that the plaintiff admittedly acted as a Managing Director of the defendants-company and he is entitled to get his arrear on the basis of decision of Board Meeting of the Company.<br/><br/>Mr. Kibria, submits further that there is nothing to disturb the finding of fact of the trial court on the question of arrear salary of him and as such the appeal should be dismissed with costs.<br/><br/>Mr. Kibria, lastly submits that the trial court should have allowed the interest at the rate of 15% per annum on the decreetal amount till realization thereof and as such he filed a Memorandum of cross-objection invoking under Order 41 Rule 22 of the Code for seeking an order of 15% interest per annum on the decreetal amount and this court for ends of justice and equity should allow such interest in favour of him to mitigate his mental and financial sufferings caused by the irresponsible act of the defendants.<br/><br/>Now to deal with the contentions raised by the learned Advocates of the contending parties we feel it necessary to decide first whether the impugned judgment and decree of the trial court below is liable to be interfered with. For coming to appropriate decision about sustainability of the impugned judgment and decree we need to assess and examine the evidence on record.<br/><br/>The plaintiff testified in support of his claim and reiterated the facts of the plaint and in his cross-examination he did not disclose any incriminating material, besides the plaintiff produced series of documents including the minutes of 26<sup>th</sup> Board Meeting of the defendant-company and the statement of his salary issued by the defendant-company which were marked as exhibits 1 to 9 in the suit.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Mir. Sarafat Ali as the Assistant Manager, Finance of the defendant No.1-Company deposed on behalf of the defendants as D.W.1 stating that the defendant No.1-Company was registered on 24.08.2000 with the Joint Stock Companies and got approval on 28.9.2000 from the Chief Controller of Insurance. He also stated that the plaintiff was the Managing Director of the defendant No.1-Company. This D.W.1 in cross-examination stated that: “মি­সলিনিয়াস ৮ নং এ সিদ্ধান্ত হয় গোলাম কিবরিয়া বেতন ভাতা ও সু­যাগ সুবিধার বিষ­য়  ৮ এর (ভ) এর প্যারা সঠিক আ­ছে.”<br/><br/>We have heard the learned Advocates of the appellants and Mr. Mohammad Golam Kibria (respondent) appearing  in person on his behalf, perused the evidence on record including the judgment of the trial court wherefrom it transpires that the defendants-company contested the suit contending inter alia that in the 26<sup>th</sup> meeting of the Board of Directors held on 15.3.2004 there was specific 7(seven) agenda but no agenda of fixation of remuneration of the plaintiff was there and the plaintiff being the then Managing Director of the defendants-company by misusing his power fixed his remuneration at the rate of Tk.40,000/- as basic salary and Tk.20,000/- as house rent per month to be paid from the month of September, 2000 as arrear basis in the heading of miscellaneous agenda of the meeting and as such the plaintiff is not entitled to get decree as prayed for as arrear of his salary.<br/><br/>We have carefully examined the minutes of 26<sup>th</sup> Board Meeting of the appellants company as produced by the plaintiff as exhibit-1 and have found that the said meeting was presided over by the Chairman of the Company (defendant No. 3) and its 11 Directors were present in the meeting and 4 (four) decisions were taken including fixation of remuneration of the plaintiff in its miscellaneous agenda which are quoted below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>No. 8 Miscellaneous.<br/>Under this item the following decisions were taken:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>(i) The long pending matter of fixation of the remuneration of Mr. Mohammad Golam Kibria, the incumbent Managing Director of the company, was taken up. After discussion the meeting fixed his remuneration at Tk.40, 000/- as basic salary and Tk.20, 000/- as house rent per month to be paid from the month of September, 2000. He will use the car during his leave.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em> (ii)………………</em><br/><em>(iii)……………. </em><br/><em>(iv)……………..</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">There being no other subject for consideration, the meeting was adjourned with a vote of thanks to the chair.<br/>Sd/Illegible<br/>(Muzaffar Hossain Paltu)<br/>Chairman of the meeting and the Board of<br/>Directors of Union insurance Co. Ltd.<br/>15.03.2004</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It also reveals that D.W.1 did not controvert or deny the authenticity of the minutes of 26<sup>th</sup> meeting of the Board of Directors of the defendants-company and the company did not deny about service of the plaintiff in the company from its inception i.e. from September, 2000 up to July 5, 2004 as the Managing Director of the Company. It is apparent from the minutes of 26<sup>th</sup> meeting of the Board of Directions of the defendant-company that the company made delay in fixing the remuneration of the plaintiff.<br/> <br/>The D.W. 1 in his deposition stated that “অত্র মামলার বাদী মোঃ গোলাম কিবরিয়া কোম্পানীর একজন ডাই­রক্টর ছি­লন এবং এম, ডি হিসা­ব দায়িত্ব ছিল। মে­মা­রন্ডাম অব আর্টি­কে­ল এর ১ নং ত্র্রমি­­ক বাদী উ­দ্দাক্তা পরিচালক ছি­­লন” In cross-examination this D.W. 1  stated that “মি­সলিনিয়াস ৮ নং এ সিদ্ধান্ত হয় গোলাম কিবরিয়া বেতন ভাতা ও সু­যোগ সুবিধার বিষ­য় ৮এর (ভ) এর প্যারা সঠিক আ­ছ”<br/> <br/>So, the Board of Directors of the appellant No.1- Company in its 26<sup>th</sup> meeting held on 15<sup>th</sup> March, 2004 by a resolution fixed the salary of the respondent at the rate of Tk.40,000/- and house rent at the rate of Tk. 20,000/- total remuneration being Tk.60,000/- per month, effective from September, 2000 is proved (exhibit-1). It is also proved that the respondent served the appellant-company as the Managing Director of the Company from September, 2000 up  to 5<sup>th</sup> July, 2004 and the plaintiff received a total amount of TK. 21,17,826/-from the company at different times up to October, 2005 as found from a letter dated 15.11.2005 issued by the appellants company (Exhibit-2).<br/> <br/>But the plaintiff was entitled to get the salary and the house rent a total of Tk. 27,69,676/- during his service period i.e. 46 months 5 days. Now the plaintiff-respondent is entitled to get Tk. 27,69,761-21,17,826= Tk. 6,51,850/- from the appellants -company as arrear salary and benefit.<br/><br/>On scrutiny of the materials on record we find that the learned Joint District Judge passed a well reasoned judgment applying his judicial mind to the materials placed before him.<br/>On scrutiny of the judgment, decree and other evidence on record particularly the minutes of 26<sup>th</sup> Board Meeting of the respondent-company, exhibit-1 and the  statement of salary issued by the appellant-company, exhibit -2 we also find that the judgment and decree of the trial court in no way can be interfered by this Court.<br/><br/>In this connection it may be pointed out that when the D.W.1 admitted that the plaintiff-respondent held the post of Managing Director of the defendant-company, in the same voice the defendant-appellants cannot say the appointment and the performance of the plaintiff-respondent as the Managing Director of the Company was illegal. It is also pertinent to point out that during service of the respondent the appellant-company did not raise any question about the age of the respondent but when he left his office and filed the suit for realization of his arrear, the appellant-company for the first time raised this question which is beyond the canons of equity and justice and judicial ethics as well. Moreover, the circular of the Directorate of Insurance dated 18.7.2001 imposing restriction about age of the Managing Director of Insurance Company was issued after joining of the plaintiff as the Managing Director of the defendant-company and hence the same is of no avail.<br/><br/>Now the question is whether the respondent is entitled to get interest at the rate of 15% per annum on the decreetal amount as claimed by the respondent in a cross-objection invoking Order 41 Rule 22 of the Code of Civil Procedure. We have noticed that the respondent filed money suit as back as in the year 2006 for realization of arrear salary and benefit and the suit was decreed in the year 2011 and the paper book of the instant First Appeal had been prepared at the cost of the respondent although it ought to have been done by the appellants and as such we feel it proper and equitable to grant interest at the rate of Taka 10% per annum for the balance decreetal amount in favour of the respondent from the date of pronouncement of this judgment till realization thereof.<br/><br/>In view of what has been stated above, we do not find merit in this appeal. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with cost of Tk. 50,000/- (fifty thousand) as condition precedent and the connected Civil Rule No. 171(F) of 2012 and the Civil Order No. 2 of 2012 are also disposed of accordingly.<br/><br/>         Send copy of this judgment to the court concerned along with lower court record at once for proceeding with execution case in accordance with law.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
