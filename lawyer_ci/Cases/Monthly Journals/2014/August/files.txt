K. M. Zahirul Hoque</u></strong><strong><u>, J.</u></strong><br/><br/>This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 29.09.2005 passed by the Judge, Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal-3, Chuadanga in Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Case No. 01 of 2003 arising out of G R. Case No. 259 of 2002 and Chudanga P. S. Case No. 04 dated 03.09.2002 convicted the accused-appellant under section 11(kha) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 and sentenced him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life and also to pay a fine of Tk. 1,000/- in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 01 (one) months more.<br/><br/>Prosecution case in short is that one Md. Alfaz Uddin on 03.09.2002 Lodged an FIR with Chuadanga Police Station alleging inter-alia that the present appellant got married with informant’s daughter Sagorika Khatun before 10/11 months; that the accused-persons used to torture her from the beginning. That about one month ago accused Aziz send her to her father’s house of bringing Tk. 20,000/- as dowry money but having been failed to pay the money informant sent her daughter to the appellant asking time to pay the money; that on 01.09.2002 at about 10 P.M. accused persons again created pressure upon the victim to pay the money but having got negative answer, the appellant kick on her abdomen and the other accused persons beat her indiscriminately; that at that time having heard the hue and cry the local persons tried to enter into the house but failed; that thereafter his daughter became sick and the accused persons took her to local doctor Monsur Ali for treatment but for the cause of critical condition she was shifted to the Chuadanga Sadar Hospital and on 03.09.2002 at about 07.00 A. M. his daughter dead there.<br/><br/>That thereafter the said police station started P.S. Case against the accused appellant and other and the case was investigated by the police and submitted charge sheet against the accused appellant and another on 02.12.2002 under section 11 (kha)/30 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000.<br/><br/>Thereafter the case was transferred to the Court of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Tribunal-3, Chuadanga for holding trial and who framed charge against the accused appellant and another under section 11(ka)/30 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 and during course of trial prosecution examined as many as 07 prosecution witnesses and defence examined none.<br/><br/>And after holding trial the Tribunal was pleased to award the above mentioned conviction and sentence against the accused appellant.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment of conviction and sentence the appellant preferred this appeal.<br/><br/>Mr. Ashif Hasan, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that there is no eye witnesses of occurrence and moreover the surathal report as well as the post mortem report disclose that the victim was death due to take poison and therefore the charge against the accused appellant was not proved by the prosecution thus the accused appellant is liable to be acquitted from the charge. And he further submits that there is no materials on records to show that the accused appellant demanded dowry to the victim as well as the informant so the charged under section 11Ka/30 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 against the appellant is not maintainable and thereby conviction and sentenced thereunder is also bad in law thus liable to be set aside. He lastly submits that the post mortem report of Doctor did  not mention the age of injury for which the appellant did not take fair defence thus he became seriously prejudiced as well as it cast a doubt in the post mortem report therefore the impugned judgment passed in pursuance of said post mortem report is not maintainable and thus the same is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Mr. Bashir Ahmed, the learned Assistant Attorney General appearing on behalf of the state and submits that the learned trial Court after considering the prosecution witnesses he found that the accused appellant committed the offence of injuries for which victim dead and thereby charge under section 11(Ka) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 against the appellant was legal and proper and conviction and sentenced under section 11(kha) of the said Act also legal and proper and the trial Court committed no more illegality in passing the impugned judgment. He further submits that immediately after occurrence the accused appellant without taking any steps cancelled himself so the conduct of the appellant alongwith the facts and circumstances of the case well proved the charge against the accused appellant and thereby the judgment passed by the Tribunal was legal and proper one. He prays that under the facts and circumstances the appeal is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>Now let us analysis the deposition of prosecution witnesses led by the prosecution side to arrive at a correct decision.<br/><br/>P. W. 1, Md. Alfaz Uddin the informant stated in his chief that the victim Sagorika is his daughter and accused Abdul Aziz got married with his daughter Sagorika and after marriage the accused and his family members used to demand Tk. 20,000/- as dowry and due to non payment of the said dowry the accused Abdul Aziz and his family member used to torture to the victim and one stage she was send to his house. Thereafter the accused again took his daughter to their residence and on 01.09.2002 he demanded dowry at about 10.00 P.M. and the victim was merociously  tortured by accused Abdul Aziz and accused Zaker. He further stated that his house is beside the house of accused persons and after hearing hue and cry they tried to go to the house of the accused but accused Abdul Aziz made threat upon them and that is why he could not go there. He further stated that due to torture his daughter victim Sagorika became sick and they secretly took her treatment by a local Doctor namely Dr. Monsur Ali, but due to her bad health condition they secretly sent her to the Chuadanga Sadar Hospital and where victim met her death on 03.09.2002. And after getting the information of her death the informant lodged the FIR on that date i.e. 03.09.2002 with the Chuadanga Police Station. He identified his LTI on the FIR and in his cross-examination he stated that the father of the accused Abdul Aziz namely Shadat Mollik has given 05 Kata of his land in the name of her daughter and he denied the suggestion of the defence.<br/><br/>P.

She denied the suggestion of the defence.<br/><br/>P. W. 4 Monowara Begum stated in her chief that on the night of occurrence the accused Abdul Aziz tortured her wife victim Sagorika. She further stated she was informed by the mother of Abdul Aziz and went there and saw the victim Sagorika was sick even she could not speak and she was requested to go to the Hospital with victim accordingly she went the Hospital along with victim in a same Van and she further stated that victim Sagorika informed her at the Hospital that her husband Abdul Aziz tortured her that is why she became sick. She further stated they reached the Hospital at about 03.00 A. M. at night and thereafter on morning at 05.00 A.M. victim Sagorika died. In his cross examination she stated she made statement before the investigating officer. She dined the suggestion of defence.<br/><br/>P. W.5, Rabeya Begum was tendered.<br/><br/>P. W. 6 Doctor Md. Nazim Uddin Khan stated in his chief that while he was on duty on 03.09.2002 at Chuadanga Sadar Hospital he hold a post mortem examination of victim Sagorika with 03 members of Medical Board. After getting the dead body from Chuadanga Police Station and after examination the said dead body he found the following injuries</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>1. One bruise at the right side of the umbilical region (</strong>নাভিদেশে<strong>) about 4”x 3”.</strong><br/><strong>2. One bruise on the left inguenal region (</strong>তলপেটের বাম নিম্ন প্রান্তদেশ<strong>) region about 2”x1”, there was also one old scar mark at the back of the elbow.”</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;">And as per the opinion the Doctor of the Board that the death as due to injury which are ant-mortem and homicidal in nature. In his cross-examination he stated that he did not mention the age of injury and he denied the suggestion of the defence.<br/> </div><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;">P. W. 7, S. I. Nazrul Islam he stated in his chief that while he was on duty at Chuadanga Police Station he engaged as a investigating officer on 03.09.2002 of the Case and during course of investigation he held the inquest report of dead body of victim Sagorika and send the deadbody to the Chuadanga Sadar Hospital for post mortem and he identified his inquest report along with signature which was marked as Exhibit 2 and 2/1. He visited the place of occurrence and prepared the sketch map alongwith index and that sketch map and index were exhibited as Exhibitros 3, 3/1, 4 and 4/1. He recorded the statement of the witnesses under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. And after holding investigation he submitted charge sheet against the accused appellant and another under section 11Ka /30 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000. In his cross examination he stated that in the surathal report Alfaz put his LTI and denied the suggestion of the defence.<br/><br/>These are the evidences led by the prosecution side.<br/><br/>It appears that the P. W. 1 after getting information lodged the FIR against the accused appellant and others alleging  that due to demand of dowry money his daughter was tortured by the accused appellant and others on  01.09.2002 and for which his daughter met her death in the Hospital on 03.04.2002 . He deposed before the Court in support of the FIR story and P. W. 2 also corroborated with the evidence of P. W. 1 and P. W. 3 immediately after occurrence heard about the commission of offence by the accused appellant from the brother’s wife of the appellant and P. W. 4 who was along with the victim she at the hospital up to her death and before death she was informed by the victim that her husband tortured the victim and due to his torture he became so sick and there is no reason to disbelieve the deposition of P. W. 3 and 4 and P. W. 5 was tendered and cross examination was declined by the defence and P.W. 6 is the Doctor who found two injuries on right side of the umbilical region and another left inguenal region and their opinion to the effect that death was due to injury mentioned which was anti-mortem and homicidal in nature  these evidences shows and well proved that the victim met her death due to those injuries and P. Ws. 1-4 along with the deposition of investigating officer and sketch map shows that the place of occurrence has mentioned in the index in the sketch map and in where index shows that <strong>“</strong>ঘটনাস্থল ১নং আসামী আজিজ এর বসত ঘর।<strong>”</strong> the place of occurrence was not denied in manner by the defence in any point of time so it is well clear that the occurrence took place within the residence of the husband of the victim and as per the evidence of P. Ws. 3 and 4 that husband of victim Abdul Aziz tortured the victim and due to that tortured she met her death in the hospital on 03.09.2002 and another exceptional circumstances is that immediately after occurrence the accused appellant concealed himself from the trial and even he did not take any step to explain under what circumstances her wife met her  death this burden of prove heavily lies upon the accused appellant as the husband of victim and while the occurrence took place with in his custody.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate for the appellant submits that the age of injury was not mentioned in the postmortem report for which the accused appellant has been seriously prejudiced. It appears that the date of occurrence took place on 01.09.2002 and thereafter he was taken to the hospital by the accused which was not denied and subsequently she made her death on 03.09.2002 that fact was also not been denied by the defence and immediately after death the surathal report was prepared by the investigation officer and post mortem was held on 03.09.2002 on the same date. So non mentioning the age of injury by the Doctor did not make the prejudice to the appellant in any manner under the facts and circumstances of the present case. Therefore the prosecution well proved the charge against the accused appellant.<br/><br/>Under the above facts and circumstances of the case, we find that the learned trial Court did not commit any illegality in passing the impugned judgment. However, it appears that the accused appellant did not use any deadly weapons for commission of injury and it also further appears that the victim was given treatment by local doctor and subsequently she was taken into hospital for her treatment. Thus it shows that the accused appellant at least do not have the mensrea to kill her. Considering the same and the extenuating circumstances we find that ends of justice will be met if the sentence is reduced to 10 years from life therefore we reduced the sentence of the appellant to 10 years rigorous imprisonment instead of imprisonment for life.<br/><br/>With the above modification the appeal is dismissed.<br/><br/>Send down the lower Court records together with copy of the judgment to the courts below at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Akram Hossain Chowdhury, J:</u></strong></span><br/> <br/>On an application under article 102 of the Constitution, the petitioner, a defendant in Artharin Suit, obtained this <em>rule nisi</em>, challenging the legality and propriety of the order dated 18.03.2010 passed by Artha Rin Adalat No. 3, Dhaka in Artha Rin Suit No. 81 of 2009.  The petitioner also sought for a direction to strike out his name as defendant from the Artha Rin Suit No. 81 of 2009.<br/><br/>The facts relavant for disposal of the rule, in brief, are that the petitioner, carrying on a business in manufacturing cloth and fabrics, in particular kitchen towel, under the name and style of M/S. Sun Textiles, a proprietorship firm, used to export its products abroad since 1998-2002 keeping good relationship with the respondent No.5 Janata bank. The respondent No.3, Bangladesh Bank vide its F.E. circular dated 02.10.1995 and the Janata Bank  vide its F.D circular dated 10.06.1997 (Annexure- A &amp; A(1) respectively) formulated the policy for providing cash incentive to those who were engaged in exporting the hand loom fabrics and textile products to abroad. As per the aforesaid circular the petitioner was entitled to get 25% cash incentive against the custom bond or duty draw back on his export bill through the respondent Janata Bank. In compliance to that the respondent Janata Bank has disbursed an amount of Tk. 3,92,488/- as cash incentive to the petitioner’s account against its export bills.  Since the export bills of the petitioner have been placed before the respondent No.3, as per requirement of its circular dated 02.10.1995 the Bangladesh Bank (respondent No.3) was bound to repay the said amount to the (respondent No.5) Janata Bank. But the respondent Bangladesh Bank made some delay in repaying the cash incentive amount as disbursed by respondent Janata Bank in favour of the petitioner. The respondent Bangladesh Bank, is dealing with the cash incentive facilities as per decision of the Government and on this regard they published the circular dated 02.10.1995; thereby the respondent Bangladesh Bank was bound to adjust the same but failed to do so.<br/><br/>On this back drop the respondent Janata Bank, imposing interest thereon, filed Artha Rin Suit No. 103 of 2006, before the Artharin Adalat No.1, Dhaka, impleading therein the present petitioner as defendant No.1, for realizing its outstanding dues claimed at Tk. 6,51,712/-. The petitioner by filing a written statement on 18.04.2007 contested the suit contending <em>inter-alia</em> that the amount as claimed in the suit is relating to an amount which has been facilitated, in favour of the defendant-petitioner as cash incentive against its export bills, by the plaintiff Bank. As per their own circular, it was the obligation of Bangladesh Bank to adjust the same infavour of the plaintiff Janata Bank and the defendant-petitioner has no liability to repay the dues incurred against cash incentive as claimed in the suit; as such, the Bangladesh Bank is liable to repay the same and thereby Bangladesh Bank is a necessary party to the suit. Subsequently vide the Court’s order dated 16.07.2007 Bangladesh Bank was made a party to the suit as defendant No.2 and ultimately the suit was transferred to the Artha Rin Adalat No. 3, Dhaka and renumbered as Artha Rin Suit No. 81 of 2009.<br/><br/>During pendency of the suit the added defendant No.2 Bangladesh Bank has paid a partial claim of the plaintiff on 17.09.2009 and then the plaintiff Janata Bank by filing an application dated 16.11.2009 amended its plaint claiming for a decree of an amount of Tk. 2,59,224/-, interest accrued on the principal amount, instead of its earlier claim of Tk. 6,51,712/-. Thereafter, on 31.01.2010 this defendant-petitioner by filing an application under Order 1, Rule 10(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure read with Section 57 of the Artha Rin Ain, 2003 (Annexure-D) prayed for striking out his name from the suit contending <em>inter alia </em>that the Bangladesh Bank by its own circular dated 02.10.1995 was in obligation to repay the cash incentive as paid in advance by the plaintiff bank against the export bills of the defendant-petitioner and subsequently they repaid the same. Accordingly in admission to the said facts the plaintiff has amended its plaint. In such a position the defendant-petitioner has had no liability on the amount as claimed in the suit. The learned Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat No. 3, Dhaka by his order dated 18.03.2010 rejected the said application holding that since it is a disputed question of fact so, is required to be decided on recording evidence.<br/><br/>In this back ground, the defendant No.1 being petitioner moved before this Court in writ jurisdiction and obtained the present rule.<br/><br/>The plaintiff-respondent Janata Bank contested the rule by filing affidavit-in-opposition contending <em>inter-alia </em>that the defendant-petitioner has availed cash incentive facilities in advance from the respondent bank, securing the same, by creating charge document and indemnity bond and as such there is no scope to escape himself from the liability of the claimed amount which was an outstanding dues accrued on his account.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Harunur Rashid, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner submitted that the amount as claimed shown in the plaint is relating to an amount in respect of cash incentive facilities provided in favour of the petitioner in compliance with the Bangladesh Bank circular dated 02.10.1995 and since the Bangladesh Bank by this time has paid the principal amount the defendant-petitioner has no liability to pay the interest as calculated thereon.  He further submitted that the interest, if any, accrued for making repayment of the cash incentive in delay, should be paid by the Bangladesh Bank.<br/><br/>On the other hand Mr. Md. Mamunur Rashid appearing with Mr. Monirul Islam the learned Advocates for the respondent No. 5, Janata Bank submitted that though the added defendant Bangladesh Bank paid the outstanding dues in part but rest of the dues shown as the interest accrued thereon for making the repayment in delay; the defendant-petitioner being a beneficiary of that facilities is liable to pay the same. He further submitted that since the defendant-petitioner has created charge document and indemnity bond, securing the repayment of the amount as paid in advance by the plaintiff Bank, he is bound to pay the claimed amount shown as outstanding dues on his account.<br/><br/>Perused the writ petition and affidavit-in-opposition along with the annexures annexed therewith and considered the submissions of the learned Advocate for both sides. We have also gone through the impugned order dated 18.03.2010 passed by the learned Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat No. 3, Dhaka.<br/><br/>The admitted position is that the defendant-petitioner on certain conditions availed the cash incentive facilities in advance from the plaintiff bank and Bangladesh Bank, the added defendant as per their circular (Annexure-A), will have to adjust the same. During pendency of the suit Bangladesh Bank though made payment of a partial amount to the claim of the suit but it was done in a belated stage; thereby, the plaintiff-respondent bank by amending its plaint prayed for a decree of the rest amount of the claim contending that since the defendant-petitioner has availed the cash incentive facilities, creating charge document and indemnity bond on this regard, he is bound to pay the interest accrued on the same.<br/><br/>But Mr. Md. Harunur Rashid the learned advocate for the petitioner emphasis us on the fact that since, by this time, the principal amount as to the claim has been repaid and adjusted by the added defendant Bangladesh Bank, the liability of interest goes upon the Bangladesh Bank who made the repayment in delay. As such, the defendant-petitioner has no liability to pay the accrued interest as accrued on the principle amount.<br/><br/>In view of the above submissions of the respective parties it appears to us that since the respondent Bank denied the petitioner’s contention, so far as, the liability of the petitioner for making payment of the interest accrued on the principle amount though the said principle amount has already been paid by the added defendant Bangladesh Bank; that question of disputed fact could not be decided without taking evidence by an appropriate Court of Jurisdiction.<br/><br/>It reveals from the impugned order dated 18.03.2010 that the learned Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat after hearing on the petitioner’s application filed under Order 1, Rule 10(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure read with Section 57 of the Artha Rin Ain, 2003, held that- “স্বীকৃত মতেই বিবাদীপক্ষ বাদী ব্যাংকের নিকট থেকে ঋণ গ্রহন করিয়াছেন। উক্ত ঋণের টাকার শর্ত মোতাবেক বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক কর্তৃক পরিশোধিত হইয়াছে এবং cash incentive এর টাকা বাবদ দাবীকৃত বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক কর্তৃক পরিশোধিত অর্থ বাদী ব্যাংক আরজি সংশোধনপূর্বক বাদ দিয়া শুধুমাত্র আদায়কালীন সুদ বাবদ অত্র মোকদ্দমাটি পরিচালনা করিতেছেন। এক্ষেত্রে উল্লেখিতঋণের টাকা কাহার নিকট হইতে আদায়যোগ্য তাহা নির্ধারনের জন্য স্বাক্ষ্য প্রমান গ্রহনের আবশ্যকতা রহিয়াছে। মোকদ্দমাটি বর্তমানে অধিকতর চুড়ান্ত শুনানীর পর্যায় রহিয়াছে। এমতাবসহায় দালিলিক ও মৌখিক স্বাক্ষ্য প্রমান গ্রহন অন্তেই তর্কিত বিষয়টি নিস্পত্তিযোগ্য বলিয়া আমি মনে করি। সেমতে বিবাদীপক্ষের ৩১-০১-১০ তারিখের দেঃ কাঃ বিঃ আইনের ১ আদেশের, ১০(২) বিধি  এবং অর্থঋণ আদালত আইন, ২০০৩ এর ৫৭ ধারার দরখাস¹ নামঞ্জুর করা হইল। আগামী ০৫-৪-২০১০ইং তারিখ F.P.H.”<br/><br/>On careful scrutiny to the above findings of the Artha Rin Adalat No. 3, Dhaka we find that no illegality has been done by the learned Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat, as because, the matter in dispute as raised by the defendant-petitioner is a disputed question of fact. In a series of decisions amongst those the case of <em><u>Shamsunnahar Salam and others –Vs- Mohammad Wahidur Rahman and others, reported in 51 DLR(AD) 232</u></em> our Appellate Division held- “<em>A writ Court cannot and should not decide any disputed question of fact which requires evidence to be taken for settlement”.</em><br/><br/>Having considered the above we are of the view that it is a clear case of disputed question of fact, as to decide, who will be liable to pay the disputed amount of interest as claimed in the suit; that dispute could not be decided in a writ jurisdiction, rather, it requires oral and documentary evidence to be taken by the appropriate court of jurisdiction for its settlement.<br/><br/>In the premises, the instant rule has got no merit. Accordingly, the rule is discharged without, however, any order as to costs. The learned Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat is at liberty to proceed with the Artharin Suit in accordance with law.<br/><br/>        <strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Khatian No.35; Balu Mollah having been in possession in exercise of his title therein, died leaving behind one son Aftab Mollah and a daughter Bindhu Bibi as his heirs. Thereafter, Aftab Mollah and Bindhu Bibi having been in possession and enjoyment of the suit land in exercise of their mourosui maliki right, executed a mortgage deed on 20.01.1932 in favour of Satiya Charan and the mortgage was subsequently redeemed. Thereafter, Aftab Mollah and Bindhu Bibi jointly possessed the suit land. Subse-quently Aftab Mollah expressed his willingness to lease out 16½  decimals of land from plot No.<u>189(359)</u> and one Hari Mohan was engaged to write the patta; said Hari Mohan  collusively entered .27 acres of land of plot No. 187 and .39 acres of plot No.190 in the registered patta deed dated 26.09.1940,  behind  the  back of  its executant Aftab Mollah ; thereafter Aftab Mollah executed another patta on 06.03.1941 wherein it was disclosed that the patta registered on 26.09.1940 was not acted upon as there were mistakes; subsequently in the year 1943 Aftab Mollah died leaving behind the plaintiffs as his heirs; the registered patta dated 26.09.1940 therefore did not confer any title in respect of  the suit land in favour of Hari Mohan. When Bindhu Bibi daughter of Aftab Mollah found it difficult to retain her property she had to bring Title Suit No. 35 of 1953 before the Munsif, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Jessore implea-ding Hari Mohan Roy, Hari Dasi and others as defendants where Bindhu Bibi got a contested decree and in that suit the patta dated 26.09.1940 executed by Aftab Mollah in favour of Hari Dasi was found as not sustainable in law. When the plaintiffs had gone for cutting Sagun tree from the suit land they were objected to by the defendant Nos.1 and 2 and at that stage the plaintiffs for the first time came to know that the record of right in respect of the suit land had been prepared wrongly in favour of the father of defendant Nos.1 and 2   although the defendants have/had no right, title,  interest or possession in the suit land conseq-uently the instant suit was brought for declara-tion of their title by the plaintiffs and for recovery of khas possession and in the alternative the plaintiffs prayed for a saham to the extent of .44 acres in the suit land by partition in the form of preliminary decree. The plaintiffs also prayed for declaration that the patta dated 06-09-1940 in favoutr of Hari Mohan Roy executed by Aftab Mollah is null and void and not binding upon the plaintiffs.<br/><br/>The defendant Nos.1 and 2 and the added defendant 3(Ka) entered appearance in the suit upon filing two separate written statements; in the written statement filed by the defendant Nos.1 and 2 they denied the material allegat-ions made in the plaint stating inter alia that the suit land along with other lands originally belonged to Balu Mollah and it was recorded in C.S.khatian No.35 correctly who having been in possession and  enjoyment of the suit land along with other lands,  died leaving behind his only son Aftab Mollah and only daughter Bindu Bibi as his heirs. Aftab Mollah being in possession of the suit land transferred .66 acres of land at a salami  of Tk.150/- fixing 2.25 anas  yearly rent upon  executing a registered patta dated 26.09.1940 in favour of Hari Dasi the  mother of defendant Nos.1 and 2,  an area of 16½ decimals of land appertaining to  plot No. 189 and plot no 356 not covered by the suit land was also transferred in favour of Hari Mohan Roy the father of the defendant Nos.1 and 2 by another registered patta dated 06.03.41 executed by Aftab Mollah and handed over possession where the predecessors of the defendant Nos.1 and 2 got possession by constructing house thereon ; the patta executed by Aftab Mollah in 1941 in favour of the father of the defendant Nos.1 and 2 being registered deed No.194 contains an averment that patta dated 06.09.1940 being a mistaken one it was not acted upon but such an averment made by Aftab Mollah in his subsequent patta of 1941 was illegal and beyond authority; Aftab Mollah and his wife admitted the predecessor of the answering defendants as tenant upon receipt of rent from them. The answering defendants have been residing in the said house constructed by their father. The answering defendants have been in possession and enjoyment of the suit land from the time of their predecessor right from the year 1940 therefore a title by adverse possession has also accrued in their favour. The answering defendant Nos. 1 and 2 also disclosed in the written statement that they have sold out .11¾ acres of land in favour of Gyanodabala by a registered kabala and had handed over poss-ession where, on the death of Gyanodabala, her son has been in possession thereof.<br/><br/>In the written statement filed by defendant 3(ka) he had adopted the written statement submitted by the defendant Nos.1 and 2 and had also added that her mother Gyanodabala purchased an area of .11 ¾ acres of land from defendant Nos. 1 and 2by a registered kabala dated 02.02.70 which was executed on 31.01.70 in favour of the mother of the answering defendant No.3(ka) and he has been in possession and enjoyment of the said land covered by the said kabala. Therefore, the defendant prayed for dismissal of the suit.<br/><br/>At the trial 6(six) issues were framed by the learned Subordinate Judge now Joint District Judge which being apt are quoted below :-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>(১)   অত্র মোকদ্দমা বর্তমান আকারে ও প্রকারে রক্ষণীয় কিনা?<br/>(২) অত্র মোকদ্দমা তামাদি দোষে বারিত কিনা?<br/>(৩) অত্র মোকদ্দমা রেসজুডিকাটা এর নীতির দ্বারা বারিত কিনা?<br/>(৪) নালিশী জমিতে বাদীপক্ষের স্বত্ব স্বার্থও দখল আছে কিনা?<br/>(৫) বাদীপক্ষ তাহাদের প্রার্থীত মতে ডিত্র্রীপাওয়ার অধিকারী কিনা?<br/>(৬) বাদীপক্ষ আর কি কি প্রতিকার পাওয়ার অধিকারী?</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In course of trial of the suit the plaintiffs examined two witnesses of them Jarina Khatun was examined a P.W.1 and Rakib Mollah was also examined as P.W.2. On the other hand, the defendant Nos.1 and 2 examined six witnesses on their behalf while the defendant No.3(ka) examined one  Guru Das as D.W.1  in support of his case.

Upon conclusion of the trial the learned Joint District Judge by his judgment and decree dated 28.11.1993 dismissed the suit.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and decree dated 28.11.1993 the plaintiffs as appellants preferred the instant appeal.<br/><br/>Mr. Zakir Hossain Bhuiyan, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants has taken us through the materials on record including the impugned judgment as also the exhibits produced from both sides and submits that in the instant appeal it is an admitted position that the suit land along with other land originally belonged to one Valu Mollah and it was rightly recorded in C.S.khatian No. 35, C.S. plot No.187 and 190 S.A khatian No.46 and 43 S.A plot Nos.209 and 210 under the mouza ghope P.S.Kotwali District Jessore and Valu Mollah having been in possession and enjoyment of the suit land along with other lands, died leaving behind his only son Aftab Mollah and only daughter Bindhu Bibi as his legal heirs who having been in possession and enjoyment of the land left behind by their father Aftab Mollah offered to lease out 16 ½ decimals of land from non suited plot Nos. 189/359 to one Hari Mohan Roy the father of respondent Nos.1 and 2 and on 26.09.1940 a collusive deed of patta was purported to have been executed and registered on 26.04.1940 in favour of Hari Dasi Roy  by Aftab Mollah and in the said deed of patta .66 acres of land from suit plots were shown to have been registered as a result in the following year i.e on 06.03.1941 Aftab Mollah executed another deed of patta  in favour of Hari Mohan Roy in respect of 16 ½ decimals of land from  non suited C.S plot No.189/359 with an averment that the deed  of patta dated 26.04.1940 in favour of Hari Dasi Roy was not acted upon because errors were detected therein; about 3 years later in 1943 Aftab Mollah died leaving behind a widow Akarjan and three minor daughters who are the appellants before this court as his legal heirs.<br/><br/>Mr. Zakir Hossain Bhuiyan, also submits that in the year 1953 Bindhu Bibi instituted Title Suit No.35 of 1953  impleading Hari Dasi Roy and Hari Mohan Roy as defendant Nos.1 and 2 seeking  a decree for partition and that suit was decreed  on contest and the plaintiff Bindi Bibi was allotted a saham to the extent of 33 decimals of land. The plaintiffs used to enjoy and possess the suit land by enjoying usufructs therefrom but the defendants raised claim of title to the suit land on the basis of the aforesaid patta and subsequent record of right prepared in their names and on 21.03.1982 the plaintiffs were resisted to cut Segun trees from the suit land by the defendants and finally on 12.01.1989 the plaintiffs were dispossessed from the suit land by the defendants, therefore, the suit was brought as aforesaid.<br/><br/>Mr. Bhuiyan submits further, that admi-ttedly the plaintiffs are the legal heirs of Aftab Mollah and consequently on his death his property devolved upon the plaintiffs as they are the legal heirs of Aftab Mollah. It is also submitted by Mr.Bhuiyan that possession of the suit land all through remains with the plaintiffs and it has been established by the evidence of P.Ws and it is also  proved through the evidence of a competent witness of convincing nature like P.W.1 who categorically stated in her deposition that the plaintiffs were dispossessed from the suit land  on 12.11.1989 and her testimonies  have been substantially corroborated on this point but the learned  Joint District Judge arrived at a finding to the contrary upon misreading of those evidence on record.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate for the appellants submits further that the patta dated 26.09.1940 has been annulled/ scraped upon stipulation of the fact that the same was not acted upon moreover the said patta has never been supplemented by any corresponding kabuliyat executed by either of the parents of defendant Nos. 1 and 2 as contemplated under section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882.<br/><br/>To substantiate his submission the learned Advocate for the appellant has placed reliance in the case of Narendra Nath Pai Vs. Abdur rahman Mollah reported in 26 DLR 45, in the case of Budhan Mahton Vs. Ramanugrah Singh and another reported in A.I.R 1947 Patna 78 and the case of Sukkada Bala  Gope Vs. Pran Hari Gope being dead his legal heirs reported in II ADC(2005) 54.<br/><br/>Mr.Bhuiyan also submits that the defendants failed to prove  any iota of evidence , substantially or collateral that the alleged patta dated 26.09.1940  executed by Aftab Mollah in favour of Hari Dasi was ever acted upon either by delivery of possession or by payment of rent to Aftab Mollah or his successors rather it appears from their exhibits Ka series that rent/ land  development taxes were paid to the government and not to their lessor Aftab Mollah or any of his heirs, moreover exhibits Ka series do not show that rent was paid in respect of the suit land as described in the schedule to the patta dated 06.03.1941.<br/><br/>Mr.Zakir Hossain Bhuiyan submits further that a case of title by adverse possession and the case on the basis of document cannot be claimed simultaneously as in the instant case. In substantiating his submission the learned Advocate placed reliance in the case of Pushpa Rani Saha Podder Vs.Rash Mohan Saha being dead his heirs Kartick Chowdhury Saha  and others  reported   in 26 B.L.D (AD) 50. <br/>Mr. Bhuiyan also submits that the  claim of title by adverse possession was neither specifically pleaded nor proved by the defendants and no issue was framed to that effect either, nonetheless the learned Joint District Judge, conferred the title on the plaintiffs by a gratuitous finding of adverse possession in their favour which is not sustainable. In this connection he placed reliance in the case of Mahaprabhu Ram Vs. Gopal Ram Ram and others reported in 42 D.L.R(AD) 154 and the case of Hazera Begum and others Vs. Roushan Ara Begum and others reported in 39 D.L.R (AD) 22, the case of Mst. Ghulam Ilahi Vs. Muhammad Waris Khan reported in 10 D.L.R (F.C) 174 and Tajuddin and others Vs. Moktar Ahmed and others reported in 1991 BLD (AD) 44. It is also submitted by Mr. Bhuiyan that S.A. record prepared in the name of the defendants which has got no presumptive value of correctness in as much as it has/had no basis as such mere preparation of S.A.khantian in their names or payment of rent by them does not create any title in favour of the defendants. In this connection the learned Advocate placed reliance in the case of  Halima Begum and others Vs. Syed Ahmed and others reported in 21 D.L.R 854. The case of Chand Mah and others Vs. Md.Hossain Ali being his heirs 1(ka) Md.Sekander Ali and others  reported in 3 B.L.C 364 and the case of Lal Mia being dead  his heirs Momena  Khatun and others Vs. Haji Md.Ibrahim reported in 28 D.L.R(AD) 61.<br/><br/>It is also submitted by the learned Advocate for the appellant that mere nonpayment of rent by the plaintiffs does not extinguish or affect their title to the suit land. In this connection the learned Advocate for the petitioner placed reliance in the case of Abdur Noor vs. Aziruddin and others reported in 21 B.L.T(AD) 161.<br/><br/>Mr.Bhuiyan submits further  that the finding of fact arrived at by the learned Munsif in Title Suit No.35 of 1953 to the effect  that the claim of the parents of  defendant Nos.1 and 2 by patta of 1940 and 1941 were bad in  law, till subsist  since no appeal or cross-appeal or revision was filed against the said judgment and decree as such the said judgment is admissible in evidence in the instant case and binding upon the defendant Nos.1 and 2 within the meaning of section 43 of the Evidence Act and it will also operate as res judicata against them  since their parents were party to that suit. In this connection the learned Advocate placed reliance in the case of Nasim Ali and another Vs. Safina Bibi reported in 1988 B.L.D 493.<br/><br/>On the other hand Mr.Manzurul Haque the learned Advocate appearing with Mr. Mahfuzur Rahman for the respondents submits that the instant suit as brought by the plaintiff appellants is barred by limitation since the same has not been brought within 12 years from the date of dispossession of the plaintiffs from the suit land more particularly  when the plaintiffs  failed to  prove their possession and dispossession on their given date and time.<br/><br/>It is also submitted by the learned Advocate for the respondent that the plaintiffs have to prove their possession in the suit land within 12 years from the date of their dispossession and referring to the deposition of P.W.1 the learned Advocate submits that the instant suit has been brought long after 12 years of their dispossession from the suit land by the plaintiffs.<br/><br/>In substantiating  his submission the learned Advocate for the respondents placed reliance in the case of Syed Moin Ahmed Vs. Khandaker Moinuddin  reported in 19 D.L.R 912 and the case of Md. Lal Mia Vs. Anowar Hossain reported in 14 M.L.R. (AD) 24.<br/><br/>Mr. Manzurul Haque the learned Advocate submits further that the plaintiff is to prove his own case  in order to obtain a decree and weakness of the defendants case is  no ground for passing a decree in favour of the plaintiffs. In substantiating his submissions the learned Advocate placed reliance in the case of  Md. Naimuddin Sarder alias Naimuddin Sarker Vs. Md. Abdul Kalam Biswas reported in 39 D.L.R (AD) 237.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate for the respon-dents submits further that in Title Suit No.35 of 1954, Ext. Ga was found to be bad in law only but it was not declared to be invalid. Therefore, the finding with respect to Ext.Ga in Title Suit No. 35 of 1954 cannot raise the issue of res judicata in the instant suit.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate for the respon-dents submits further that possession under mistaken or invalid title is effective to extinguish owner’s title. The plaintiffs did not claim their title by adverse possession is not enough to deny the relief he is entitled to. In substantiating his submission the learned advocate placed reliance  in the case of  Sadak Ali Vs. Suruj Ali and others reported in 7 D.L.R 95.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate for the respondent submits lastly that the apparent observation in Title Suit No.35 of 1954 with respect to Ext. Ga to the effect that the same is bad in law by the trial court was not given by framing any issue to that effect, therefore, such observation having no binding effect on any person whatsoever therefore does not raise any question of res judicata in the instant suit.<br/><br/>We have heard the learned Advocates for the parties, perused the materials on record  including the depositions of the witnesses and the documents exhibited from both sides wherefrom it transpires  that the main issue involved in this appeal as to whether  patta dated 26.09.1940 purported to have been executed by Aftab Mollah one of the admitted original owner of the suit land in favour of Hari Dasi Roy , Ext.Ga had divested Aftab Mollah of his title to the properties  covered by the said patta or not , if the answer is in the affirmative in that case ,  case of the plaintiffs must fail. But if the answer is in the negative in that case , the plaintiffs must succeed , therefore, having concentrated our full attention to the said  Ext. Ga, we find that Title Suit No.35 of 1954( wrongly written as 1953 in some places) was instituted before the 3<sup>rd</sup> Court of Munsif, Jessore by Bindhu Bibi as plaintiff impleading Hari Mohan Roy and Hari Dasi Roy as main defendant Nos.1 and 2 respectively along with 5 others as defendants seeking a decree for declaration of plaintiffs title to the extent of 5 annas 4 pai share in the suit land  and possession therein by partition and in the said suit one of the six issues issue No.5 was to the effect as under :-       </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">‘’Has the plaintiff her alleged right title and interest in the land in suit.’’</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It may be pointed out that Bindhu Bibi is the only daughter of Valu Mollah the admitted original owner of the suit land which was also averred  in Title Suit No.35 of 1954. Of course, Bindhu Bibi had only one brother named Aftab Mollah and this part of the case is also admitted by both the parties.<br/>Having gone through the judgment delivered in Title Suit No.35 of 1954 carefully, we find that in that suit too Hari Mohan Roy and Hari Dashi Roy claimed their title in the suit land as defendants on the basis of two pattas one dated 26.09.1940 executed by Aftab Mollah in favour of Hari Dasi Roy and the other dated 06.03.41 executed by Aftab Mollah in favour of Hari Mohan Roy and in deciding  the title  the plaintiffs the learned Munsif clearly observed as under:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>‘’As regards patta in favour of Hari Dasi defendant No.2, which is dated 26.09.40 it is said in the body of the patta dated 6.3.41 Ext. A(1) that patta was not acted upon and not given effect to  between the parties due to some errors and remained with the grantor.’’</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the body of the same judgment, following the aforesaid observation the learned Munsif has also recorded another finding as under:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>``A point has been raised as to whether defendant’s alleged lease is governed by B.T Act or T.P Act. It is in the evidence that he has taken lease of the property for residential purpose and admittedly this defendant himself is a carpenter.’’</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It is also observed by the learned Munsif in his said judgment to the effect</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>‘’ admittedly the suit land situated within Jessore Municipality and it is also admitted that land was taken lease for residential purpose ..............’’</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In deciding the plaintiffs title in the said Title Suit No.35 of 1954 the learned Munsif arrived at a definite finding to the effect:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>‘’ the defendants’ alleged lease as observed defective, cannot bind her share  and in view of the findings above and reasons therefore the issue No.5 is determined and answered  in the affirmative.’’</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>We have also found that in the said Title Suit No.35 of 1954 the validity of the two pattas, one in favour of Hari Mohan Roy dated 26.04.40 and other dated 6.3.1941 Ext. A and A(1) respectively in that suit were very much in issue before  the  learned Munsif  and hving considered the submission from both sides and upon consideration of the evidence on record available before him the learned Munsif arrived at a definite finding as quoted above. Therefore, findings in respect of both the two documents namely the aforesaid two pattas are very much binding upon the parties. involved in that suit, more particularly when it is an admitted position that the said judgment and decree passed in Title Suit  No.35 of 1954 was not challenged before any higher forum  and in such view of the matter we have no hesitation to hold that the finding with respect to patta dated 26.09.40 executed by Aftab Mollah in favour of Hari Dasi Roy as arrived in Title Suit No.35 of 1954 operate as res judicata , therefore,  no finding to the contrary with respect to the said document Ext. Ga in this appeal namely patta dated 26.09.40 executed by Aftab Mollah in favour of Hari Dasi Roy is possible ,therefore, it can be safely held  that the Ext.Ga did not confer any title in favour of Hari Dasi Roy or in other words divested Aftab Mollah of his title in respect of the land covered by the same.<br/><br/>In respect of said Ext.Ga it may also be pointed out that the same is hit by section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act since no corresponding kabuliyat was executed by Hari Dasi Roy or Hari Mohan Roy in favour of the executants, therefore,  those two documents Ext.Ga and Ga(1) are mere unilateral ones as opposed to the requirements of section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act. In this connection we can safely hold that the decision cited by the learned Advocate for the appellant and reported in 26 D.L.R 45 and 2(A.D.C) Appellate Division Cases 54 are very much applicable in this appeal.<br/><br/>On a close scrutiny of the Ext.Ga  we find  that the said document namely registered patta  dated 26-09-40 contains four pages of which first two pages are of the same hand and the last two pages appears to have been written by different hand. This is a position which has however not been agitated by any of the parties, therefore, we are not going to make any  finding on this point though it appears to be as such. On a scrutiny of the trial court ‘s judgment we do not find any definite finding about the genuineness or otherwise of Ext. Ga  rather the learned Joint District Judge dismissed the suit mainly on the ground of absence of possession of the plaintiffs in the suit land beyond the period of limitation according to him. But in our considered opinion, we find that the learned Joint District Judge ought to have arrived at a different finding with respect to the said document Ext.Ga, therefore, it transpires further that the learned Joint District Judge misdirected himself in arriving at a decision in the instant suit. The finding of the learned Joint District Judge in the impugned judgment to the effect:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“নালিশী ভূমিতে বাদীগনের দখল থাকা মর্মে কিংবা বেদখল হওয়া মর্মে কোন প্রমানাদি নাই। বিবাদীগন তাহাদের পূর্ববর্তীত্র্রমে নালিশী ভূমিতে দ্বাদশ বর্ষের বহু উর্ধ্বকাল যাবৎ স্বত্ববান দখলকার থাকায় নালিশী ভূমিতে তাহাদের বিরুদ্ধ দখল জনীত স্বত্বের উদ্ভব হইয়াছে বলিয়া আদালত মনে করেন। অধিকন্তু অত্র মোকদ্দমা res judicata দ্বারা বারীত বলিয়া বিবেচিত হয়।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>are based on misreading and misconstruction of evidence of P.Ws.1 and 2 while  the evidence on the point of res judicata is totally miscon-ceived and based on total misconstruction of the pleadings of the parties rather in this connection we have found the finding with respect to Ext.Ga arrived at by the learned Munsif in Title Suit No.35 of 1954(wrongly written as 1953) operates as res judicata on a finding to the contrary in respect of Ext.Ga in the present suit and the finding of the learned Munsif in the previous suit in this respect stands as final by operation of law.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In this connection deposition of P.W.1 may be referred to where she categor-ically asserted (plaintiff No.3)</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“ ইংরেজী ১৯৮২ সালে আমরা কেছ করি। নালিশী জমি হইতে বর্তমানে বেদখল আছি। মামলা দাখিলের  সময় আমাদের দখল ছিল। ইংরেজী ৮৯ সালের ১১ মাসের ১২ তারিখে বেদখল করে। ঐ দিন এই মামলার তারিখ ছিল। ঐ দিন আমি বিবাদীদের দ্বারা বেদখল হই”।------আমার নানী আমাকে বিয়ে দেয়। তখন নানী বাড়ী থাকতাম।-----আমার বাবা  কোন সালে মারা যান বলিতে পারি না।----নানী বাড়ীতে আমরা ৩ বোন মানুষ হই। জন্মের পর থেকেই আমরা নানীর কাছে। কত বছর থেকে সেখানে থাকি বলিতে পারি না। মা মারা যাওয়ার পর সেখানে যাই। তখন আমার বয়স কত বলিতে পারি না------</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It may be pointed out that this witness has learnt to put her signature only from her neighbor. Therefore, she is an illiterate rural woman and there are every reason for her to make some confused statements in her cross-examination by legal experts.<br/><br/>P.W.2 Rokib Mollah who reside to the east of the suit land deposed to the effect “বাদীরা যখন নালিশী জমি দখল করিত তখন তাহারা নালিশী জমি থেকে নারিকেল, বাঁশ, খেজুরের রস নিয়ে আসতো। আজ থেকে ১০/১২ বছর আগে বাদীরা ঐ সমস্ত জিনিস আনে বলে আমি জানি।” the said witness is aged about 70 years.<br/><br/>Defendants witnesses are six in number of them D.W.1 Hem Chandra Roy who is defendant No.1 D.W.2 Md.Shahabuddin D.W.3 Adiluddin Bepari D.W.4 Md.Motiar Rahman D.W. 5 Noban Ali D.W.6 Eakub Ali Biswas they have deposed in the case and supported the defendants story therein but for our purpose we do not feel it necessary to discuss the same elaborately  in view of our finding to the effect that the Ext.Ga the patta dated 26.09.40 was never acted upon ,therefore, it had not conferred any title either to Hari Dashi or her successor the defendants. On the contrary we have also noticed that by the patta dated Ext. Ga(1) executed by Aftab Mollah in favour of  Hari Mohan Roy dated 8.3.41 relates to the some land beyond the suit land where  the defendants claimed to have been in possession by erecting their homestead  and the said land being adjacent to the suit land. The learned Joint District Judge got himself confused referring to different statements made by the witnesses and consequently dismissed the suit on the point of limitation holding to the effect that the plaintiffs failed to prove their possession within 12 years from the date of institution of the suit.  Therefore, the findings of the trial court with respect thereto are not at all sustainable in law.<br/><br/>Having gone through the Ext. Ka series which have been  claimed to be rent receipts but those  are paid to the government but not to the lessor Aftab Mollah  nor any of the members of his family  moreover those rent receipts tax receipts do not attract the suit land as no specification of land is available therein  . It may also be pointed out that the defendants took a duel plea in their pleading in a casual way, one is that they claim title on the basis of patta dated 26.09.40 and the other one for adverse possession. The learned Joint District Judge dismissed the suit  and arrived at a conclusion that the defendants acquired title both on the basis  of their pattas as well as by adverse possession , which is not sustainable in law ,  in view of the principle of law enunciated in 26 B.L.D (AD) 50 to the effect that  case of title  by adverse possession and a case of title on the basis of  document cannot be claimed  simultaneously but in the instant case the plaintiffs did so . In this connection it may also be pointed out that the claim of title by adverse possession though accepted by the trial court was neither specifically pleaded nor proved by  evidence . In the instant case and in the position like this the finding of title by adverse possession by the defendants as arrived by the trial court cannot  but be treated as gratuitous finding of adverse possession and in this connection reference may be made to the case of Mahaprabhu Ram Vs.Gopal Ram Ram  reported in 42 D.L.R (AD) 154. It may also be pointed out that the learned Joint District Judge committed error of law without applying his judicial mind to the settled position of law that possession can never be adverse if it is referable to lawful title. Since in the instant case the defendants claim lawful title on the basis of two separate registered deed of patta , on the one hand , and title by adverse possession on the other, as such both  the pleas taken by the defendants must fail since in such a situation any court or tribunal becomes totally  perplexed as to which version of their claim is to be believed or disbelieved. In this connection reference may be   made to the case of Hazera Begum and others Vs. Rowshan Ara Begum reported in 39 D.L.R (AD) 22 and Mst.Ghulam Ilahi Vs. Muhammad Waries Khan  reported in 10 D.L.R (FC) 174. The learned Joint District Judge also failed to appreciate that the defendants plea of adverse possession is not tenable in law against the plaintiffs since they are rightful claimants to the suit land. Reference may be made in this connection to the case of Abdul Latif Vs. Abdul Malek Kazi and others reported in 1984 B.L.D (AD) 15. It may also be pointed out that record prepared in the names of the defendants has got no presumptive value of correctness in as muchas it has/had no basis particularly in view of our finding that Ext.Ga is not sustainable in law as such mere preparation of S.A.khatian in favour of the defendants or payment of rent by them to the Government do not create any title in their favour. In this connection reference may be made to the case Lal Miah being dead his heirs Momena Khatun Vs. Haji Md.Ibrahim and others reported in 28 D.L.R (AD) 61. It may be pointed out further that the finding of the learned Joint District Judge on the point of res judicata is patently wrong and not sustainable in law particularly in view of the settled principle that right to partition is a continuous right.  Reference may made in this connection to the case of Most. Meheron Nessa  Vs  Ali Ahmed Khan and others reported  in 15 M.L.R 197 and in this connection it may be recalled that the finding of the learned Munsif ,3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Jessore in Title Suit No. 35 of 1954 to the effect that the pattas in favour of both the mother and father of defendant Nos.1 and 2 executed in the year 1940 and 1941 were bad in law, is a finding  which has been subsisting till date particularly in view of the fact  that the judgment of the said suit was not challenged before any higher  forum at any stage and more so when the predecessors of the defendants 1 and 2 were very much contesting parties in that suit and in such view of the matter the said judgment is admissible in evidence in the instant suit and the same is binding upon the contesting defendant Nos.1 and 2 particularly in view of the provision of section 43 of the Evidence Act and in that view of the matter such finding with respect to the pattas of 1940 and 1941 operates as res judicata in the instant case . In this connection reference may be made to the case of Nasim Ali and another  Vs. Sakina Bibi  reported in 1988 B.L.D 493.<br/><br/>We have also noticed that the learned Joint District Judge  has opined that the suit land has been left  un specified in the plaint such an opinion or  finding is simply unwarranted in view of the fact that the suit land has been described with reference to plot number as available in the record of settlement survey . It ought to have been held that it is tantamount to sufficient compliance of the requirements of Order 7 Rule (3) of the Code of Civil Procedure and a contrary view is not sustainable in law.<br/><br/>The trial court ought to have held that the judgment and decree passed in Title Suit No.21 of 1947 and Title Appeal No. 98 of 1948 as also the judgment of Civil Revision   Case No. 1199 of 1942 being not in tra party those are not binding upon the plaintiffs and more so judgment of a criminal proceeding cannot be admitted into evidence in deciding a civil suit and a contrary view being opposed to the settled principles of law those are not sustainable.<br/><br/>We have also noticed that the plaintiff-appellants in their plaint disclosed the cause of action in the suit in the languages as under:- “সে মতে জেলা যশোরের থানা কোতয়ালীর অন্তর্গত যশোর পৌর এলাকাধীন ৯২ নং ঘোপ মৌজায় বাদীগনের পিতৃ বিয়োগের পর নালিশী সম্পত্তি হইতে বেআইনী ও তঞ্চকীভাবে বেদখল হইবার প্রতিদিন হইতে ও সর্বশেষ বিগত ইংরেজী ১৯৮২ সালের মার্চ মাসে বাদীগন নালিশী ভূমি ও গৃহাদিতে তাহাদের পৈত্রিক স্বত্ব সম্বন্ধে সম্যক জ্ঞান লাভ করিবার সময় হইতে বাদীগনের বিবাদীগন বিরুদ্ধে বর্তমান নালিশের কারন উদ্ভব হওয়ায়----------আদালত হইতে”<br/><br/>In view of the evidence led by the plaintiffs through P.W.1 and corroborated by P.w.2 the trial court ought to have held that in the instant case the question of limitation ought to have been construed liberally and a contrary view as has been taken in the instant case by the learned Joint District Judge is not sustainable in law.<br/><br/>In view what has been stated above, we find substance in this appeal. Accordingly, the same is allowed without any order as to costs and the impugned judgment and decree dated 28.11.1993 passed by the Subordinate Judge now  Joint District Judge, Jessore is hereby set aside and Title Suit No. 06 of 1986 brought by the plaintiffs is hereby decreed as prayed for and the defendants are hereby directed to vacate the suit land upon removing the structures, if any,  within 60 (sixty) days from the date of receipt of the judgment, failing which the plaintiffs are at liberty to recover khas possession of the suit land through court by  process of execution.<br/><br/>Send down the lower court records with a copy of this judgment at once, to the court concerned for compliance.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

However the petitioner made a statement in the writ petition about his case which is as follows:<br/><br/>        “Under small industrial loan BISIC on 18.5.94 by sanction letter No. 94/04 the defendant received Taka 3,92,500/- and the defendant petitioner having adjust the loan of Taka. 72,303/- but the plaintiff Bank fraudulently created over draft loan(OD) of Taka 16,55,545/- and when it was detected , the plaintiff offered the petitioner a loan of Taka 30,00,000/-/-(thirty lacs) on condition that the Over Draft of Taka 16,55,546/- was to be adjusted from the said loan and the rest amount will be given to the petitioner and the  plaintiff obtained from the petitioner collateral security of Taka 33,50,000/- in their favour but the above plan did not materialize but the  plaintiff, with ill motive ,kept the collateral security in their custody and suppressing the real facts filed the instant suit.”<br/><br/>The plaintiff bank examined one witness as P.W. 1 in support of its case and the defendants also produced one witness as D.W. 1 in support of his case.  Besides, both the parties produced some relevant papers and documents which were duly marked as exhibits in the Artha Rin suit.<br/><br/>The Artha Rin Adalat upon consideration of the evidence on record passed the impugned order dated 25.7.2004 and thereby decreed the suit against the defendants to the following manner:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><u>আদেশ নং-৩৩,তারিখ-২৫/৭/০৪</u><br/>অদ্য মোকদ্দমাটি রায় প্রদানের জন্য ধার্য্য আছে। রায় ভিন্ন ৭(সাত) ফর্দ্দে লিখিত হইয়াছে এবং নথী সামিল আছে। রায় প্রকাশ্য আদালতে প্রদান করা হইল। রায়ের হুকুম হয় যে,মামলাটি দোতরফা সুত্রে বাদী পক্ষের অনুকুলে খরচাসহ ডিত্রিু হইল। বাদী পক্ষ ৩৯,৮৯,৪১২/-(উন চল্লিশ লক্ষ উন নব্বই হাজার চার শত বার) টাকা পাইতে হকদার মর্মে ঘোষনা করা হইল। এবং বত্রুী ৮০০০০০/-(আট লক্ষ) টাকা বাবদ বাদীর বরাবর বন্দকী সম্পত্তির মালিকানা ৩৩(৭) ধারার বিধান অনুসারে বাদীর অনুকুলে বর্তাইল। বাদী পক্ষের প্রতি ৩৩(৭) ধারার সার্টিফিকেট ইস্যু করা হউক। বাদী পক্ষের প্রাপ্য টাকা এই রায় ঘোষনার ৪০ (চল্লিশ) দিনের মধ্যে বাদী পক্ষকে প্রদান করিবার জন্য বিবাদী পক্ষকে নির্দেশ দেওয়া হইল। অন্যথায় বাদী পক্ষ উত্তু ডিত্রুীকৃত টাকা আদালতের মাধ্যমে আদায় করিয়া লইতে পারিবে।</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;">স্বাক্ষর- অস্পষ্ট<br/>অর্থঋন জজ, অর্থঋন ২য় আদালত,<br/>বাগেরহাট</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The Artha Rin Adalat also issued certificate under sub section (7) of section 33 of the Artha Ain, 2003 (<strong>hereinafter referred to as the Ain, 2003) </strong>in favour of the plaintiff bank by its order dated 29.8.2004 by virtue of the judgment and decree dated 25.7.2004.<br/><br/>Thereafter the petitioner approached this Court upon impugning the said judgment dated 25.7.2004 along with order dated 29.8.2004 by which the Adalat issued certificate under section 33(7) of the Ain, 2003 in favour of the decree holder bank and the Rule was issued as stated above.<br/><br/>Mr. S. N. Goswami, the learned Advocate appearing with Ms. Afsana Begum Advocate on behalf of the petitioner submits that the Artha Rin Adalat without applying its judicial mind issued certificate under section 33(7) of the Ain, 2003 at the time of passing the impugned judgment  in favour of plaintiff bank and thereby adjusted the value of the mortgaged property of the borrower with the decreetal amount which should be declared illegal, without jurisdiction, without lawful authority and is of no legal effect.<br/><br/>Mr. Goswami, the learned Advocate submits further that the Artha Rin Adalat issued certificate under section 33(7) of the Ain, 2003 in favour of the decree holder bank without putting the decree in execution as per Chapter VI of the Ain, 2003. The plaintiff bank did not even file any application for deduction of the value of the mortgaged property. In such situation issuing certificate under section 33(7) of the Ain, 2003 in favour of the plaintiff bank should be declared illegal, without jurisdiction and is of no legal effect.<br/><br/>Mr. Goswami, the learned Advocate further submits that the plaintiff bank filed the Artha Rin suit violating the mandatory provision of section 47 of the Ain, 2003. The bank was barred from filing any suit for recovery of its principal loan amount plus more than 200% interest accrued thereon and in such view of the matter the impugned orders should be declared illegal and without jurisdiction.<br/><br/>Mr. Goswami, the learned Advocate finally submits that the suit was filed on 29.4.2003 prior to enactment of Artha Rin Ain, 2003 and as such the suit ought to have been proceeded in view of the provision of Artha Rin Ain, 1990 <strong>(the Ain, 1990) </strong>and that there was no provision in the said Ain, 1990 to adjust the value of mortgaged property with the decreetal amount,  and to claim the penal interest and on those counts the judgment of the Adalat should be struck down.<br/><br/>In support of his submission Mr. Goswami, the learned Advocate placed reliance on the cases of (1) M/S. United Leather International vs. Artha Rin Adalat and others reported in 17 BLT (AD) 204, (2) Md. Joinaul Abedin Mintu vs. Joint District Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court Tangail and others reported in 18 BLT 277, and (3) Humayun Hossain Khan vs. Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Finance &amp; others reported in 61 DLR (AD) 92.<br/><br/>On the other hand, in reply Ms. Hosneara Begum, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent bank submits that a judgment debtor is not competent to challenge the judgment and decree of the Artha Rin Adalat and in such view of the matter there is nothing to interfere with the judgment and decree of Artha Rin Adalat invoking writ jurisdiction.<br/><br/>Ms. Hosenara, the learned Advocate submits further that the judgment debtor is required to file appeal in compliance with the provision of Ain, 2003 and on that count the impugned judgment and decree passed by the Artha Rin Adalat should not be knocked down invoking writ jurisdiction.<br/><br/>Ms. Hosenara, the learned Advocate finally submits that the Artha Rin Adalat passed the impugned judgment and thereby decreed the suit  against the defendants and the Adalat also exercised its jurisdiction as contemplated in sub section (6) and (7) of section 12 of the Ain, 2003 and adjusted  the value of the mortgaged property with the decreetal amount  and then issued certificate under section 33(7) of the Ain, 2003 in favour of the plaintiff bank and as such there remains nothing to interfere with the judgment and decree of the Artha Rin Adalat and consequ-ently the Rule should be discharged.<br/><br/>Ms. Hosenara, the learned Advocate in support of her submission referred to the case of Mir Motiur Rahman Zehadi Vs. Artha Rin Adalat, Tangail and another reported in 15 BLT (AD) 267.<br/><br/>We have heard the learned Advocates of both the parties, perused the writ petition, impugned orders, anexures and gone through the decisions referred to, wherefrom it transpires that virtually the petitioner has challenged the judgment and decree of Artha Rin Adalat and an order of issuing certificate under section 33(7) of the Ain, 2003 in favour of the plaintiff bank.<br/><br/>The Artha Rin Adalat at the time of passing the judgment and decree has exercised its jurisdiction as contemplated under subsection (6) and (7) of section 12 of the Ain, 2003 and issued certificate under section 33(7) of the Ain, 2003 in favour of the plaintiff bank. So, we have to look into the provisions of subsection (6) and (7) of section 12 of the Ain, 2003 which reads as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>12. <em>(1) .......................................................</em><br/><em> (2) ......................................................</em><br/><em> (3) ......................................................</em><br/><em>(4) .......................................................</em><br/><em> (5) ......................................................</em><br/><em>(</em>৬<em>) </em>কোন আর্থিক প্রতিষ্টান উপ-ধারা (২) ও (৩) এর বিধান পালন না করিলে, আদালত স্ব-উদ্যেগে অথবা দায়িকের লিখিত আবেদনত্রুমে, ডিত্রিু প্রদান করিবার সময় উত্তু আর্থিক প্রতিষ্টান কর্তৃক উত্ত সম্পত্তির প্রদর্শিত মূল্যায়নের, যদি থাকে, সমপরিমাণ অর্থ মামলার দাবী হইতে বাদ দিয়া ডিত্রিু প্রদান করিবে এবং প্রদর্শিত মূল্য না থাকিলে, আদালত, সম্পত্তির সহানীয় অধিক্ষেত্রের সাব-রেজিষ্ট্রারের প্রতিবেদন গ্রহণ করিয়া, মূল্য নির্ধারণ করিবে এবং নির্ধারিত উত্তু মূল্যের সমপরিমাণ অর্থ মামলার দাবী হইতে বাদ দিয়া ডিত্রিু প্রদান করিবে।<br/><em>(</em>৭<em>) </em>উপ-ধারা (৬) এর অধীন যে সম্পত্তির মূল্য মামলার দাবী হইতে বাদ দিয়া ডিত্রিু প্রদান করা হইবে ,উত্তু সম্পত্তির মালিকানা ধারা ৩৩  এর উপ-ধারা (৭) এর বিধানের অনুরতপ পদ্ধতিতে আর্থিক প্রতিষ্টানের অনুকূলে ন্যসত হইবে।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>On a plain reading of those above statutory provisions of sub section (6) and (7) of section 12 of the Ain, 2003 it appears that the Adalat upon its own initiative and without any application of the borrower can deduct the value of the mortgaged property of the borrower from the decreetal amount at the time of passing the decree in the suit.<br/><br/>So far the submission of the learned Advocate for the petitioner that the suit was filed prior to enactment of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 and the provision of section 12(6) of the Ain, 2003 would not be applicable to  the instant case, we hold that according to section 60(3) of the Ain, 2003, all the pending Artha Rin suits have to be treated as if they were filed within the provision of Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 and to be dealt  with in accordance with the new enactment of the Ain, 2003 and as such the submission of the learned Advocate for the petitioner to that effect has got no substance.<br/><br/>It appears that the order dated 25.7.2004 has been challenged by the petitioner virtually it is a judgment of the Artha Rin Adalat but the settled principle of law is that a judgment debtor is required to file appeal in compliance with the provision of Ain, 2003. So, the writ petition filed challenging the validity of the judgment and decree of the Artha Rin Adalat is incompetent and not maintainable except the petitioner being a judgment debtor to show that the judgment and decree suffers from without jurisdiction or in other words coram non judice or out come or fraud committed on court. In the instant case the petitioner failed to show that the judgment passed by the Artha Rin Adalat suffers from any malafied in other words coram non judice or out come of fraud committed on court.<br/><br/>The decision in the case of M/S United Leather International vs. Artha Rin Adalat and others reported in 17 BLT (AD) 204, referred to by Mr. S. N. Goswami, the learned Advocate is not applicable in the present facts and circumstances of the instant case. Because on that case the defendant of a Artha Rin suit, filed an application under section 12(2) and 57 of the Ain, 2003 praying for direction upon the plaintiff bank for sale of the pledge goods and to adjust the claim amount with the sale proceeds of the pledge goods and fix the actual claim and that the Artha Rin Adalat  rightly rejected the said application of the defendant observing that the value of the pledge goods, if any, be considered by the court at the time of passing the judgment and decree of the suit. This Court also concurred with the above decision of the said Artha Rin Adalat.<br/><br/>The decision in the case of Md. Joinul Abedin Vs. Joint District Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Tangail and others reported in 18 BLT 277 as referred to by Mr. Goswami, the learned Advocate is not also applicable in the present facts and circumstance of the instant case. On that case the decree holder bank without taking any steps for sale of the mortgaged property as per provision of Chapter VI of the Ain, 2003 filed an application for getting certificate directly in original proceeding as per provision of section 33(5) of the Ain, 2003. This Court correctly  held that the order of issuing certificate under section 33(5) of the Ain, 2003 in favour of the decree holder bank without going through the execution process  for selling the mortgaged  property first invoking section 33 (1)(2)(3) was patiently unlawful.<br/><br/>The other decision in the case of Humayun Hossain Khan Vs. Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Finance and others reported in 61DLR(AD) 92  as referred to by Mr. Goswami, the learned Advocate  is not also applicable in the present case in our hand. Upon that case a question was raised whether section 47 of the Ain, 2003 can be given effect to any pending suit filed prior to enactment of Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003. The Appellate Division held that:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“We have perused the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division and also the provisions of section 47 and section 60 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003. There is no ambiguity in the language of the law. Which clearly indicate that section 47 cannot be given effect to any pending suit filed prior to promulgation of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Moreover it appears from the plaint that the plaintiff bank claimed that the petitioner had taken loan of Tk. 21,19,830/- upon 3 phases and the bank filed the suit for realization of Tk. 47,82,062/- which was within the limit as provided in section 47 of the Ain, 2003.<br/><br/>So the submission of the learned Advocate for the petitioner that the plaintiff bank filed the Artha Rin Suit for recovery of Tk. 47,82,062/- but the principal loan amount was Tk. 3, 92,500/- and out of which the petitioner has paid Tk. 72,303/- and thus filing of the suit was clearly barred as per provision of section 47 of the Ain, 2003 in which the bank cannot claim beyond 3 fold of the principal loan amount has got no substance.<br/><br/>It is evident from the amended order dated 17.8.2004 the decree was passed against the defendants for Tk. 47,82,062/- and the Artha Rin Adalat adjusted the value of the mortgaged property of the borrower amounting to Tk. 8,00,000/- with the decreetal amount in view of the provision of section 12(6) of the Ain, 2003 and issued a certificate in favour of the plaintiff bank under section 33(7) of the Ain, 2003 in compliance with the provision of  section 12(7) of the Ain, 2003.<br/><br/>It is pertinent to mention here that section 12 (8) of the Ain, 2003 provides a remedy to the judgment debtor for claiming compensation, if any irregularity or illegality is found in the process of sale of the mortgaged property or in other words in the process of adjustment of value of the mortgaged property of the borrower with the decreetal amount.<br/><br/>On consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case as well as the provision of Ain, 1990 and particularly section 12(6), (7) and (8) read with section 60(3) and 33(7) of the Ain, 2003, we are of the view, that the Artha Rin Adalat has correctly passed the judgment and decree and adjusted the value of the mortgaged property of the borrower from the decreetal amount which does not call for any transference.<br/><br/>On the other hand the judgment and decree of the Artha Rin Adalat cannot be interfered with invoking the writ jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution, as there is an alternative provision for appeal against a judgment of the Artha Rin Adalat under the Ain, 2003.<br/><br/>In the instant case we do not find that the judgment of the Artha Rin Adalat suffers from coram non judice or without jurisdiction or in other words outcome of fraud committed on court. In such view of the matter we do not find any substance in the Rule.<br/><br/>        In the result, the Rule is discharged. However without any order as to cost.<br/><br/>        The stay order stands vacated.<br/><br/>        Send copy of this judgment to the Artha Rin Adalat, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Jessore.<br/><br/>        <strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

H. Rahmant Ullah laid a trap case on 18.09.2008 and recovered Tk. 15,000/- from the pocket of Fani Bushan Debnath paid by Salauddin Mintu. Accordingly after making the seizure list on the inventory recovered money, Kotwali Model P.S. Case No. 47 dated 18.09.2008 was started against the appellant.<br/>The case was duly been investigated by the Assistant Director of the Anti Corruption Commission, who submitted a charge against the appellant under section 5(2) of Act II of 1947 read with section 161 of the Penal Code and the case was thereafter transmitted to the court of Divisional Special Judge, Barishal for trial and registered as Special Case No. 15 of 2009 wherein a charge was so framed under section 5(2) of the Act-II, of 1947 read with section 161 of the Penal Code which was read over to the accused person wherein he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/><br/>During trial the prosecution examined 11 witnesses and defence examined none.<br/><br/>Thereafter the appellant was examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, wherein he again claimed to be innocent.<br/><br/>On considering the evidences and hearing the parties the learned Divisional Special Judge, Barishal convicted the appellant and sentenced him as stated above.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved there against the appellant preferred the instant appeal.<br/><br/>Mr. Yousuf Hossian Humayun, the learned Advocate appearing for the appellant at the very out set submits that the trial was held on corum non judice because the instant trap case was initiated without prior approval of the authority of the Anti Corruption Commission, in view of the fact the trial was vitiated and the appellant is entitled to get benefit of doubt and an order of acquittal, He further submits that this is absolutely a case of no evidence since excepting the P.W. 4, there is no witness to corroborate the alleged recovery of money in order to prove the trap case, in view of the fact since the prosecution failed to prove the charge leveled against the appellant the impugned judgment is liable to set aside.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Khorshed Alam Khan along with Mr. A.K.M. Fazlul Huq, the learned advocate appearing for the respondent No. 2 Anti Corruption Commission on drawing our attention to the sanction letter as exhibited in court as Ext. 2 submits that there was a sanction for institution of the trap case. Even then if there is no proper sanction before the initiation of the proceeding the trial can not be said to be vitiated since the law does not speak like that. In the premises the trial was hold properly and since the prosecution proved the charge leveled against the appellant by adducing sufficient evidence the impugned conviction as awarded after proper assessment of the evidence on record, the trial court committed no illegality, he finally prays for dismissal of the appeal.<br/><br/>Heard the learned advocate of both the sides and perused the L.C. Records and the impugned judgment.<br/><br/>According to the FIR, the case of the prosecution side is that one Salauddin Mintu (P.W. 10) on 19.08.2008 filed an application to the Deputy Assistant Director Anti Corruption Commission, Barishal for making an arrangement to apprehend the accused Engineer Fani Bhushan Debnath, while taking bribe for clearing a Bill due to him. He further made an allegation in the said application that by this time he has paid Tk. 40,000/- and further agreed to pay the demand of Tk. 15, 000/- to the appellant and he thus wants to initiate a trap case against him, in view of the said information a trap case was initiated by the Deputy Assistant Director, Anti Corruption Commission M. H. Rahmatullah and arrested the accused petitioner with Tk. 15,000/- as alleged to be recovered from him on 18.09.2008. While deposing in court as P.W. 1 the said M. H. Rahmatullah asserted that before initiating the impugned proceeding he obtained sanction later from the authority and he produced a sanction latter before the court which was exhibited in court as Ext. 2. It has been argued by the learned advocate for the appellant that the trap case was initiated without any sanction. Perusing the record we found that Ext. 2 is a sanction latter produced as alleged to be obtained prior to initiation of the impugned trap case. Now on perusal of the sanction latter (Ext. 2) it appears that the said sanction was given on an information, which was as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">ঠিকাদারী কাজের ১৭ লক্ষ টাকার বিল পরিশোধের মোট ৬১ হাজার টাকা উৎকোচ দাবীর প্রথম পর্যায়ে ৪৫ হাজার টাকা পরিশোধে উৎকোচ গ্রহনকালে আসামী ফনি ভূষন দেবনাথ আঞ্চলিক রক্ষণাবেক্ষণ প্রকৌশলী, আঞ্চলিক খাদ্য নিয়ন্ত্রক কার্য্যালয়, বরিশালকে হাতে নাতে ধরিয়ে দেওয়ার জন্য অভিযোগকারী লিখিতভাবে এজাহারকারীকে অভিহিত করেন|</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Thus the sanction was given to a case of a fact as disclosed above is a different fact, not the fact of the instant case, trap case was initiated only on Tk. 15,000/- previous to that the informant paid Tk. 40,000/- thus perusal of the said sanction letter Ext. 2 we found that sanction was shown to have been accorded was not in conformity with the fact of the case as well as not in this case, in the premises the case was initiated absolutely without any prior sanction. Now it has been submitted by the learned advocate on behalf of the Anti-Corruption Commission that although it is presumed that no sanction was accorded but the trial could not be said to be vitiated since there is no provision like that in the Anti-Corruption Commission rules. In order to appreciate the said submission, now we like see the provision of rules 16 of the Anti Corruption Commission Rules, 2007 which runs as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>১৬। ফাঁদ মামলা (Trap case)।-(১) দূর্নীতি প্রতিরোধের নিমিত্তে আইনের তফসিলভুক্ত অপরাধের জড়িত কোন ব্যক্তি বা ব্যক্তিবর্গকে হাতে নাতে ধৃত করিবার উদ্দেশ্যে তদমেত্মর দায়িত্বপ্রাপ্ত কমিশনার এর অনুমোদনক্রমে তৎকর্তৃক ক্ষমতাপ্রাপ্ত কর্মকর্তা ফাঁদ মামলা (Trap case) প্রস্ত্তত করিতে বা পরিচালনা করিতে পারিবেন।<br/>(২) ফাঁদ মামলা তদমত্ম কার্যক্রম কেবল তদমেত্ম ও দায়িত্ব প্রাপ্ত কমিশনার বা তদকর্তৃক ক্ষমতাপ্রাপ্ত কমিশনের পরিচালক পদমর্যদার নিমেণ নহেন এমন একজন কর্মকর্তা কর্তৃক সম্পন্ন করিতে হইবে।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>On perusal of the aforesaid rules it appears that this is the intention of the legislature that before initiating a trap case a prior sanction from the officer authorized by the Anti Corruption Commission is must. The prior sanction to initiate a trap case is a prerequisites scheme which has been formulated with a view to preventing corruption for the purpose to catch hold red handed any person or persons connected with offences specified in the schedule of the Act, provides safety measures to the honest and innocent government official in the discharge of duty from harassment and victimization in the hands of unscrupulous elements and this being beneficial must be strictly observed and adhered to.<br/><br/>In the instant Case we have observed above that there was no sanction to initiate a trap case, Which is a clear violation of main element as well as prerequisites scheme of law as formulated by the legislature under rule-16 of the Anti Corruption Commission Rules 2007. Thus the case proceeded without sanction has vitiated the trial abinitio. The impugned judgment awarded thereupon has got no legs to stand, which is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>Secondly it has been argued that this is absolutely a case of no evidence. To appreciate this argument now we like to see the evidences adduced by the prosecution side. Out of 11 P.W.s, P.W. 11 was the court witness and P.W. 1 M. H. Rahmat Ullah, who lodged the FIR as well as investigation officer of the case, who submitted the charge sheet in this case deposed in court as of FIR.<br/><br/>P.W. 2 Md. Delwar Hossain Molla office Assistant Cum Typist of the office of the Regional Controller of Food, Barishal as employee of the office and a seizure list witness proved his signature in the seizure list admitted in his cross-examined that আমি আসামীকে ঘুষ দিতে দেখিনাই|<br/><br/>P.W. 3. Tofazzal Hossain another seizure list witness, Who is the Assistant Cum Typist of the said office deposed as of P.W. 2 and in his cross-examination admitted that: আসামীকে কেহ ঘুষের টাকা দিয়েছে তা আমি দেখি নাই ও আসামীর কাছ থেকে জব্দকৃত টাকা উদ্ধার হতে আমি দেখি নাই- এসব সত্য|<br/><br/>P.W. 4 Abdullah Al Mamun A.S.I of police, member of the raiding party, who deposed as of P.W. 1.<br/><br/>P.W. 5 Constable Khalilur Rahman, another witness of the seizure list has deposed that in his presence some documents were seized from the office is a formal witness who has got no personal knowledge about the money recovered in the trap case.<br/><br/>P.W. 6 Samsul Huq, was declared hostile by the prosecution side since he did not support the prosecution case.<br/><br/>P.W. 7 Assistant Inspector of Anti Corruption Commission state in his deposition that in this presence inventory list was prepared on the money which was alleged to be placed a trap case so he has no personal knowledge of recovery of money in a trap case.<br/><br/>P.W. 8A. Mannan, R.M.O. of the office, a seizure list witness in his presence some documents was recovered from the office and has got to personal knowledge about the alleged recovery of money in a trap case.<br/><br/>P.W. 9 Advocate Zahidul Kabir Zahid, Councilor Ward No. 28, Barishal City Corporation, he proved his signature in the inventory list, who is not a witness of the trap case of recovery of the said money from the accused appellant.<br/><br/>P.W. 10 Md. Salauddin Mintu is the informant of the case on which the case was initiated.<br/><br/>P.W. 11 Md. A. Khaleque deposed in court as court witnesses, who is the father of the informant Md. Salauddin Mintu (P.W. 10) is hearsay witness and has got no personal knowledge of recovery of money of the said trap case.<br/>These are the evidences adduced by the prosecution side.<br/><br/>Considering the aforesaid witnesses we found that only P.W. 4 and P.W. 1 have supported the prosecution case and none of the seizure list witnesses have supported the prosecution story, accordingly the alleged recovery of the money as said to be placed in the trap case was proved by any local independent witness, even not by the any member of the office wherefrom the alleged trap case was conducted, In the premises, we are inclined to accept the contention of the learned advocate for the petitioner to the effect that this is absolutely a case is no evidence and the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the alleged recovery of the money in a trap case.<br/><br/>In all views of the matter, we found that the appellant was convicted on mere surmises and conjecture and he is entitled to get benefit of doubt at least and the impugned judgment is liable to be set aside. We thus found merit in this appeal.<br/><br/>In the result the appeal is allowed and the judgment and order dated 31.08.2009 passed by the learned Divisional Special Judge, Barishal in Special Case No. 15 of 2009 is hereby set aside and the appellant is found not guilty of the charge leveled against him and he is hereby acquitted and he is discharged from his bail bond.<br/><br/>Send down the L.C. Records along with the judgment at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Akram Hossain Chowdhury, J:</u></strong></span><br/><br/>This Rule was issued calling upon the opposite party to show cause as to why the judgment and order dated 21.07.2002 passed by the Additional Session Judge, Sirajgonj, in Criminal Appeal Nos. 23 of 2002, 5 of 2002 and 3 of 2002 affirming those of conviction and sentence dated 28.02.2001 passed by the Assistant Sessions Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Sirajgonj, in Sessions Case No. 33 of 1995 should not be set aside and/or such other or further order or orders passed as to this Court may seem fit and proper.<br/><br/>The accused petitioners were put on trial before the Assistant Sessions Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Sirajgonj to answer the charge under Section 382/458 of the Penal Code, in Sessions Case No. 33 of 1995.<br/><br/>The facts remained in the prosecution case in brief is that one Md. Liaqat Ali being informant lodged an FIR with Rajgonj Police Station implicating the present convict petitioners and others as accused alleging <em>inter-alia </em>that on 22.11.1989 at night about 12:00 o’clock the informant and his wife were sleeping in their south facing ten shed house, at that time his younger brother Nazrul raised hue and cry expressing that dacoits had entered into their house by breaking the wall of the house. Hearing such hue and cry of his brother the informant and his wife woke up; while the informant coming out from his house and screamed out to rescue them, the accused Guljer Hossain and Kashem entered into his bedroom and dealt a Lathi blow on the head of the informant’s wife and they breaking chest lock took away handloom saris of different colours worth of Tk. 9000/- and a cassette player worth of Tk. 2800/-; the dacoits also took away different colour and branded saris from his brother’s house worth of Tk. 19,400/-. The accused Saiful, Golam Hossain and Shahidul were also along with the docaits and they carring with the stolen goods went away to the western side of the house. Hence, the case started against the convict petitioners and others under Section 382/458 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>After holding investigation of the case the police submitted charge sheet against the convict petitioners and others under Sections 382/458 of Penal Code. The case being ready for trial the case record was sent to the Sessions Judge, Sirajgonj for disposal and the same was registered as Sessions Case No. 33 of 95. Eventually the said Sessions Case was transferred to the Court of the Assistant Sessions Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Sirajgonj for trial and the learned Judge of the said Court after hearing parties framed charge against the petitioners under the above noted sections, to which the petitioners were pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/><br/>At the trial the prosecution examined 9 witnesses and the defence cross-examined them but no defence witness was examined.<br/><br/>After completion of the trial the learned Assistant Sessions Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Sirajgonj by his judgment and order dated 28.02.2001 convicted the accused petitioners and others under Sections 382/458 of the Penal Code and sentenced them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 5 years and also to pay fine of Tk. 5,000/- each in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 6 (six) months more.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the said judgment and order of conviction and sentence, the convict petitioners as appellants preferred three separate Criminal Appeals being Nos. 23/2002, 03/2002 and 5/2002 before the Sessions Judge, Sirajgonj; subsequently the said appeals were heard and disposed of by the Additional Sessions Judge, Sirajgonj, who upon perusal of the evidence on record and hearing the parties by its judgment and order dated 21.07.2002 affirming the trial Court’s judgment and order of conviction and sentence dismissed the appeals.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the said judgment and order of the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Sirajgonj dated 21.07.2002, the convict appellants as petitioners by filing an application under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure obtained the instant Rule.<br/><br/>Mr. Aminul Haque the learned Advocate appearing with Mr. Md. Abdul Jabbar, Advocate for the petitioners submitted that the Court’s below upon misreading the evidences on record passed the impugned judgment and order of conviction, whereas the present case has suffered from various illegalities. Mr. Hoque further submitted that in the present case the vital witnesses i.e. the investigating officer and the seizure list witness were not examined; moreover, to prove the case under Section 382 of the Penal Code neither any Medical Certificate nor a Doctor had been examined in the Case. Mr. Haque by placing the deposition of P.W. No.4 Md. Nazrul Islam, submitted that this prosecution witness being the brother of the informant, on whose alarm the informant woke up and recognized the accused persons but this witness in his cross-examination contradicted with the other prosecution witnesses; he also could not recognize the accused Guljer though the said accused is a nearest relative of the informant and the present witness Nazrul. His further submission was that from the trend of cross-examination of the witnesses it revealed that there was a longstanding land dispute between the informant party and the convict petitioner Guljer Hossain and thereby the informant with a false plea to harass the petitioners filed the instant case. He finally submitted that since the prosecution was failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence, so far it relates to the present petitioners, are liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>On the other hand the learned Deputy Attorney General Mr. M.H. Sharder appearing with Mr. Md. Asaduzzaman, the learned Assistant Attorney General representing the opposite party state submitted that the Courts below upon proper assessment of the material evidence on record rightly passed the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence which do not calls for any interference and as such the same is to be maintained.<br/><br/>Heard the learned Advocates, perused the material evidence on record and gone through the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence. It appears from the record that in the instant case the vital witnesses who are namely the investigating officer and the seizure list witness were not examined. It also reveals that the defence plea was that there was a longstanding land dispute between the informant and the convict petitioner Guljer Hossan who being the brother-in-law of the informant claimed his share of landed property from the informant party, hence on a false plea the case was filed against petitioners. In support of their above plea the accused petitioners cross-examined the prosecution witnesses wherein from the trend of cross-examination of the witnesses we find support of that defence plea. Moreover, in the instant case no eye witness other than the informant was examined in the case and the vital prosecution witness Md. Nazrul Islam (PW-4) who is the brother of the informant, on whose alarm the informant woke up and saw the accused persons but in his cross-examination this prosecution witness Nazrul Islam disclosed that he could not identify the accused persons who were also present in the dock. Whereas, the P.W.1, informant and the other prosecution witnesses in their cross-examination disclosed that the accused Goljer Hossain who was present in the dock, is a nearest relative of the informant but the P.W.-4 Nazrul Islam, in his cross-examination contradicted the said version of the prosecution witnesses saying that he could not recognize the accused persons who were involved in the alleged occurrence and also present in the dock. More so, in the instant case no such evidence has been adduced before the trial Court to prove the offence of Sections 382/458 of the Penal Code and neither any Medical Certificate was produced nor a Doctor has been examined before the trial Court to prove such offence. But without having any corroborative evidence in proving such offence the trial Court convicted the petitioners under Section 382/458 of the Penal Code holding that the prosecution was able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and the appellate Court being the last Court of fact also failed to ascertain the above legal aspect in passing its Judgment dismissing the appeals and affirming the trial Court’s judgment and order of conviction and sentence without giving any cogent ground. As such, the said Judgment has caused to an error of misreading of the evidence on record and also misappreciation of law.<br/><br/>Considering the above it appears to us that the learned Judge of the Trial Court as well as the Appellate Court has misread the evidence on record and also without appreciating the material facts and law passed the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence which suffers from various irregularities and illegalities. As such the same is to be interfered with. Thus, we find merit in the rule.<br/>         <br/>In the result, the rule is made absolute. The judgment and order dated 21.07.2002 passed by the Additional Session Judge, Sigrajgonj, in Criminal Appeal Nos. 23 of 2002, 5 of 2002 and 3 of 2002 dismissing the appeals affirming the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 28.02.2001 passed by the Assistant Sessions Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Sirajgonj is hereby set aside. The accused petitioners are acquitted from the charge as leveled against them under Section 382/458 of the Penal Code and they are discharged from their respective bail bonds.     <br/><br/>Communicate this judgment and order to the concerned Court at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Kalam Khan, Sub Inspector of Police of Fazilpur Police Camp under Sailakupa Police Station, Jhenidaha, on 29.6.2000 lodged the First Information Report (<strong>shortly the FIR</strong>) stating that he received an information over wireless from A.K.M Razul Karim S.I of Police that a gray colour private car violating the signal of the police personnel was proceeding towards Hat Fazilpur from Hat Gopalpur. So the informant along with other police personnel of the Hat Fazilpur Police Camp laid an ambush near Kumiradah village on the Road, named as Hat Gopalpur-Sailakupa Road. At about 13.05 p.m. the said car reached the place of their ambush. They managed to stop the car by creating a barricade. Then the informant, in presence of the witnesses, searched into the car and found India made176 bottles of phensedyl kept in the backside of the car. The appellants and 2 (two) others were in the car, who on query disclosed that they had bought the said bottles from one Muklashur Rahman of Kaligong Rail Station Para for selling the same at Faridpur. So the informant seized the car and the bottles in terms of a seizure list, arrested the appellants and their companions and lodged the FIR.<br/><br/>Police investigated into the matter and submitted charge sheet against the appellants and three others under item No. 7 (ka) of the Table of Section 19(1) of the Madok Drabbo Niantran Ain, 1990, read with Section 25 B of the Special Powers Act, 1974.<br/><br/>The case was ultimately transferred to the learned Assistant Sessions Judge-cum-Special Tribunal No. 4, Jhenidaha who framed charge under Section 25 B of the Special Powers Act, 1974.<br/><br/>To prove the charge, the prosecution produced 11 witnesses of whom P.W. 9 was tendered and P.W. 10 was declared hostile and cross-examined by the prosecution.<br/><br/>Defense did not produce any evidence, but cross-examined all the P.W’s except P.W. 9 and 10. The defense pleas, as it appears from the trend of cross examination of the prosecution witnesses, are that they were innocent and the police implicated them falsely in the instant case for not giving the money demanded by the police.<br/><br/>The trial court, on consideration of the evidence on record and  on hearing the learned Advocates of both the sides, found the 2 (two) appellants along with 2 (two) other co-accused  guilty of the offence under Section 25 B(2) of the Special Powers  Act, 1974 and sentenced them as stated above.<br/>Co-accused Mokhlesur Rahman, after being released on bail, absconded and the trial was held in his absence. The trial court acquitted him on the finding that the charge was not proved against him.<br/><br/>Mr. Asaduzzaman, the learned Advocate for the appellants submitted that the impugned judgment and order is liable to be set-aside for the following reasons:</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The charge framed by the trial court is defective in that it speaks of importation of the seized goods from India, but according to the FIR, the goods were seized within the territory of Bangladesh.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The conviction is based on insufficient evidence, as all the three seizure list witnesses being P.W.2, 4 and 10 stated that they had not witnessed the fact of search and seizure. More over P.W. 2 and 4 stated that the seizure list was prepared at the Fazilpur Police Camp, but P.W. 10 the other seizure list witness stated about preparation thereof at the Sailakupa Police station. So requirements of section 103 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (shortly the Code, 1898) was not complied with.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">P.W. 7, being one of the police witnesses, stated that he had stated under section 161 of the Code that the place of occurrence was at Baroihuda.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The prosecution did not produce S.I. A.K.M. Rezaul karim, who allegedly informed the informant about the running car violating the police signal at Hat Gopalpur.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">P.W. 11, being the Investigating Officer, stated that he came to know during investigation that the appellants were the helper and driver of the car and the other two co-accused were the passengers.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The bottles allegedly containing phensedyl or any sample thereof were not examined by any expert and therefore these goods cannot be treated as phensedyl or as contraband goods so as to attract section 25B(2) of the Special Powers Act.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">The learned Assistant Attorney General, Mr. Md. Abdur Rahman Hawlader on the other hand, submitted that the seized 176 bottles of phensedyl, being the material exhibit “ka”, were produced before the trial court containing the words “phensedyl” and “Made in India” and that the prosecution has proved that the same were legally seized from the possession of the appellants and their companions.<br/><br/>The learned AAG further submitted that the informant, the investigating officer and other police witnesses had no enmity with or grudge against the accused persons and they had no reasons to file a false case against them. Moreover the seizure list witnesses and other local witnesses fundamentally corroborated the evidence of the police witnesses and thus the prosecution case has been proved beyond reasonable doubt.<br/><br/>Before discussion on the sustainability of the impugned judgment of the trial court, we need to look into evidence on record.<br/><br/>P.W. 1 Kalam Khan, stated that on the date of occurrence he was working as a Sub Inspector of Police attached to Fazilpur Police Camp, under P.S Sailakupa, Jhenidaha. He stated about lodgement of the F.I.R and he proved the F.I.R and the seizure list  as Exhibits 1 and 2 and his signature therein as  Ext. 1/1 and Ext. 2/1 respectively. He re-iterated the facts as stated in the FIR. He also identified the bottles of phensedyl as Material Exhibit ‘Ka’ and stated that the bottles were seized from the possession of the appellants and other co-accused persons. He also stated that the seized goods were of Indian origin.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that, out of the persons standing on the dock, he could not say who were the driver and the helper of the car.<br/><br/>P.W. 2 Md. Amzad Hossain Chowkidar, is a seizure list witness. He stated that, on 29.6.2000 at about 1.p.m, police captured some bottles of phensedyl kept in a bags near Fazilpur Bazar. Police asked him to put his signature on the seizure list and accordingly he put his signature (Exhibit-2/2).  He also stated that he heard from the local people that some phensedyl were captured from the possession of the accused persons, but he could not exactly state whether the bottles produced in court were the bottles seized at that time. In his cross-examination he stated that he could not state the contents of the seizure list.<br/><br/>P.W. 3, Shyamol Kumar Biswas, being a local school teacher, stated that, near his school, at about 1 pm, he found a gray colour private car and also found some police personnel and three persons along with some bottles of phensedyl which were seized by the police and kept on the car. But he could not identify the accused persons on the dock. However he identified the phensedyl bottles that were recovered from the place of occurrence. In his cross-examination he stated that phensedyl bottles were kept on the roof top of the car.<br/><br/>P.W. 4, Jamirul Islam, is a seizure list witness of the locality. He stated that, at about 1 p.m. on 29.06.2000, he found some people assembled near the police camp and also found a private car and some bottles of phensedyl at that place. He was present at the time of seizure of the bottles of phensedyl from the car and identified his signature (Exhibit-2/3) on the seizure list. But in his examination he stated that he put his signature on a blank paper at the instance of the Daroga.<br/><br/>P.W. 5, Md. Zinna Mollah, another witness of the locality, stated that he found some people assembled at Fazilpur Police Camp and he heard that 176 bottles of phensedyl were captured from some persons. P.W. 5 identified the said phensedyl bottles, (Material Exhibit- Ka), but he could not say the names of those persons.<br/><br/>P.W. 6 Anwar Hossain, S.I. of police, on the date of occurrence was attached to Fazilpur Police Camp. In his examination-in-chief he made statements similar to those of the informant (P.W. 1) about the date, time, place and manner of the occurrence. In his examination in cross P.W. 6 stated that on obtaining the information from  Hat Gopalpur Police Camp they laid an ambush at Kumiradah and found the car coming towards to them and thereafter they managed to arrest the 4 (four) accused persons staying in the car in presence of local witnesses. Then they took the said car to the   police camp afterwards. However he could not say as to whether the seizure list was prepared in front of the camp or inside the camp office.<br/><br/>P.W. 7, Md. Abdur Razak, stated that on 29.6.2000, he was attached to Fazilpur Police Camp. In examination-in-chief, he made statements similar to those of P.W. 1 and 6 about the seizure of the phensedyl bottles from the possession of the 4 accused persons. In his examination in cross P.W. 7 stated that they laid an ambush on a road of Baroihuda and arrested the accused persons with the bottles of phensedyl, but he could not say who made the seizure list.<br/><br/>P.W. 8 Md. Nurul Islam is another police personnel who also attached to Fazilpur Police Camp on the date of occurrence. In exami-nation-in-chief he made statements similar to those of P.W. 1, 6 and 7 about the date, time, place and manner of occurrence at Kumiradah. In his examination in cross P.W. 8 stated that there was no house near the place of their ambush and that they created a barricade by a rickshaw van to stop the car and that O.C. Shahadat took the seized car to the police station.<br/><br/>P.W. 9 Habilder Md. Raza Mia, was tendered but not examined by the prosecution and defense declined to cross examine this witness.<br/><br/>P.W. 10 Md. Faridul Islam, a local witness, stated that he put his signature (Exhibit 2/4) on the seizure list, but he was not present at the place of occurrence. However he heard that some persons were arrested with phensedyl. He did not see the accused persons, but at the instance of the Daroga he put his signature in the seizer list at the police station. At this stage he was declared hostile and cross examined by the prosecution, whereupon he denied the prosecution suggestion that he put his signature in the seizure list at the place of occurrence and that he deposed falsely to protect the accused persons. He was not cross examined by the defence.<br/><br/>P.W. 11, Sub Inspector Md. Hafiz Iqbal, investigated into the case. He stated that, during investigation, he visited the place of occurrence, prepared the sketch map with index thereof (Exhibit 4 and 5), seized the documents of the car in terms of a seizure list (Exhibit-3), examined the accused persons and witness under section 161 of the Code, 1898 and submitted charge sheet against the five accused persons. He indentified them and also the seized phensedyl bottles of Indian origin.<br/><br/>In his examination in cross, P.W-11 stated that accused Rafiqul Islam and Mafujul Islam were the driver and helper of the car respectively. He stated that he did not send any sample of the phensedyl for chemical examination and he also stated that sometimes it might not be possible on the part of the passengers to know as to whether any materials or goods were lying in the backside of the car.<br/><br/>Apart from the oral evidence, the prosecution produced some documentary evidence, namely the FIR, (Exhibit-1), the seizure list (Exhibit-2), another seizure list of the car (Exhibit-3) and the sketch map and index of the map of the place of occurrence (Ext. 4 and 5).<br/><br/>On perusal of these documents we find that the contents of the FIR –Exhibit -1 are the same as stated by the maker thereof being the informant, P.W-1.<br/><br/>The seizure list –Exhibit -2 states about seizure of 176 bottles of phensedyl containing the words “PHENSEDYL, RHONE POULENC Made in India” kept in two plastic bags in the backside (bonette) of a car being Dhaka Metro Ga -11-2653 at a place at village Kumiradah, contiguous to Hat Fazilpur Bazar on 29.06.2000 at 13.05 p.m.<br/><br/>The said seizure list contains the signature of three witnesses, being P.W, 2, 4 and 10.<br/><br/>There is another seizure list –Exhibit 3 –prepared about seizure of the said car.<br/><br/>The Sketch Map and index thereof –Exhibits 4 and 5, shows the location of the place of occurrence.<br/><br/>The principal fact in issue in this case is whether the phensedyl bottles in question were captured from the possession of the appellants, namely from the car in question.<br/><br/>On this fact in issue, the police witnesses, namely P.W. 1,6,7 and 8, being members of the raiding party ,unequivocally and in the same voice, stated about the date, time, place and manner of seizure of the phensedyl bottles from the car wherein the two appellants and their two companions were staying .<br/><br/>However P.W-7, one of the police personnel, stated in cross examination that the place of occurrence was Baroihuda.<br/><br/>We do not find any material on record to disbelieve the testimony of the police witnesses. The variation in the statement of P.W-7 about the place of occurrence to be at Baroihuda appears to be a misstatement and do not tally with other evidence on record including the statements of the local witnesses, namely P.W-2,3,4,5 and10. None of them stated about Bariohuda. So the said variation in the statement of P.W-7 may be safely ignored.<br/><br/>With regard to the defence suggestion that the police personnel falsely implicated the appellants and their companions because the later did not pay the bribe demanded by the former appears to be a mere suggestion without any supporting evidence or even without any particulars about the place, reason or otherwise. Such suggestion does not negate the credibility of the testimony of the police witnesses.<br/><br/>There is nothing on record to show that the police witnesses had any previous grudge or enmity with the appellants or their companions. It is not believable that the police witnesses would implicate the appellants or their companions by implanting 176 bottles of phensedyls.<br/><br/>The seizure list witnesses admitted their signatures on the seizure list –Exhibit -2 by which the phensedyl bottles were seized. But there are some variations in their statements with regard to their witnessing the fact of search and about the place where they signed the seizure list and also their knowledge about the contents of the seizure list.<br/><br/>While P.W.10 Faridul Islam, a witness declared as hostile by the prosecution, stated his ignorance of the search and seizure, P.W-2 and 4 stated that they saw the phensedyl bottles, the arrested accused persons, and capture of the bottles from the car. However both of them stated that the search and seizure was conducted near the Fazilpur Police Camp.<br/><br/>P.W-3 a resident of Kumirapara and a school teacher, stated about the scenario immediately after the arrest of the accused persons. He witnessed the search and seizure and thus fully corroborated with the statement of the police witnesses.<br/><br/>The testimony of the Police witnesses and those of the local witnesses considered as a whole lead us to believe the prosecution case that the phensedyl bottles were seized from the car in which the appellants and two other accused persons were staying.<br/><br/>It is evident from the evidence on record that the fact of search and seizure took place on a road known as the Hat Gopalpur to Sailakupa Road and that the police personnel had to stop a running car in which the bottles were kept.<br/><br/>In such a situation all the formalities of complying with the requirements of section 103 of the Code, 1898, as pointed out by the learned advocate for the appellant was not humanly possible. Such non-compliance does not render the result of search and seizure unlawful.<br/><br/>The mode of search and seizure contemplated in the said section 103 does not fit in a situation like this.<br/><br/>We have perused the Judgment in the Case of Habibur Rahman alias Jane Alam vs. the State 47 DLR (1995), 323 with regard to the compliance of section 103 of the Code, 1898. The fact of that case are totally different and the observation made therein and as referred to by Mr. Assduzzaman the learned Advocate are not applicable in this Case.<br/><br/>With regard to the statement of P.W-11 to the effect that he during investigation came to know that the present appellants were the driver and helper of the car does not negate the fact of their collective possession over the seized phensedyl bottles.<br/><br/>With regard to the absence of any chemical examination report on the contents of the seized phensedyl bottles, as pointed out by the learned Advocate for the appellants, we hold that no chemical examination report is necessary in the present Case.<br/><br/>It is in evidence that the seized bottles contain labels with the words “PHENSEDYL RHONE POULENC Made in India” and such a description about the contents of the bottles is sufficient to prove that those were Indian made phenedyl.<br/><br/>That “Phensedyl” is a contraband item is clearly spelt out in section 8 of the Drug Control Ordinance, 1982 read with SL.No.52 of schedule III of the Ordinance. The said section is quoted below.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong><em>8. –Prohibition of  Manufacture, etc., of certain medicines.-</em></strong><em>(1) On the commenc-ement of this ordinance, the registration or license in respect of all medicines mentioned in the schedules shall stand cancelled, and no such medicine shall, subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), be manufactured, imported, distributed [, stoked, exhibited or sold] after such commencement. </em><br/><em>(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1),-</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;margin-left: 40px;"><em>(a)..................................................</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;margin-left: 40px;"><em>(b)..................................................</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>(c) The medicine specified in schedule III may be manufactured, imported, distributed and sold for a period of [eighteen months] after the commencement of this Ordinance, and thereafter there shall not be any manufacture, import, distribution [, stock, exhibition or sale] of such medicines.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Section 8(2)(c)   clearly prohibits the manufacture, importation, distribution, and sale of the items mentioned in Schedule III after  eighteen months of the commencement of Ordinances, 1982. Again SL. No.52 of Schedule III specifies “Drug Admin Code No. 004-62-40, name of produce Phensedyl”.<br/><br/>Thus the aforesaid provision has clearly identified phesedyl as a contraband item. So the possession of phensedyl for the purpose of sale falls within the purview of section 25 B (2) of the Special Powers Act, 1974, which prohibits possession of contraband goods for the purpose of sale.<br/><br/>In the absence of any explanation from the appellants, the very number of bottles being 176 clearly indicates that, those were kept for sale.<br/><br/>It is noted that, the trial Court mentioned in the Charge the accusation of importation of the phensedyl bottles from India. The exact wordings are as follows: গাড়ী তল্লাশী করিয়া ১৭৬ বোতল ভারতীয় ফেন্সিডিল উদ্ধার করেন যাহা আপনারা অবৈধভাবে ভারত হইতে বাংলাদেশের অভ্যন্তরে আনিয়া ফরিদপুরের উদ্দেশ্যে লইয়া যাইতেছিলেন। আপনারা অবৈধভাবে নিজেদেরকে লাভবান করিবার উদ্দেশ্যে উক্ত ফেন্সিডিল আমদানী করিয়াছেন।”<br/><br/>The language of the charge contains an indication of the offence of smuggling as provided in subsection 25B(1), which provides for a penalty of minimum 2 (two) years up to life imprisonments.<br/><br/>But in the impugned Judgment the trial court rightly and lawfully found the appellants guilty of the offence of possession of contraband goods for sale under sub-section 25 B(2) of the Special Powers Act, 1974.<br/><br/>So the argument advanced by the learned Advocate for the appellants with regard to defect in the charge is not acceptable to us. The trial court can find an accused guilty and sentence him under a section with lower penalty.<br/><br/>In view of the above we hold  that the prosecution could prove beyond reasonable  doubt that the appellants committed  offence under  section  25 B(2)  of the Special Powers Act, 1974 .We find no illegality or infirmity  in the findings or decision of the trial Court.<br/><br/>We have noticed that the appellants are the driver and the helper of the car respectively and 176 bottles of phensedyl were recovered from the collective possession of 4 (four) accused persons. So considering the quantum of the phensedyl and the absence of any previous conviction we hold that the ends of justice will be met if the sentence of 5 (five) years imprisonment is reduced to 1 (one) year, and the fine is reduced to TK. 1000/- in default, a sentence of 1 (one) month more.<br/><br/>In the result, the appeal is dismissed with modification in quantum of sentence imposed by the Special Tribunal No.4, Jhenidaha in Special Tribunal Case No. 65 of 2000 to the effect that the appellants are sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 1(one) year, instead of 5(five) years, and also to pay a fine of Tk.1000/- in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 1(one) month more. The period of their custody prior to the pronouncement of the Judgment by the trial Court (on 15.9.2002) will be deducted from the said period of imprisonment of 1 (one) Year.<br/><br/>The appellants are directed to surrender before the trial Court to serve out the remaining period of imprisonment, if any.<br/><br/>Send down the lower Court records, along with a copy of this Judgment.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

Sultan Mahmud Afrad, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that on perusal of the first information report and the charge sheet, it appears that lodging of the fist information report and submission of charge sheet by the same enquiry officer and institution of criminal proceedings is illegal and as such continuation of the proceedings against the petitioner is an abuse of the process of the Court and is liable to be quashed. He also submits that the instant proceedings against the petitioner is barred under section 218 of the Customs Act wherein it has been stated that no proceeding in a Court other than a suit shall be concerned against any officer of customs or any other persons exercising any powers conferred or discharging any duties imposed by or under this Act for anything purporting to be done in pursuance of the provisions of this act or the rules without giving to such officer or persons a month’s previous notice in writing of the intended proceedings and of the cause thereof, or after the expiration of one year from the accrual of such cause and in view of the provisions the initiation of the proceedings against the petitioner is an abuse of the process of the Court and is liable to be quashed.

Kahlilur Rahman, Assistant Inspector, Task Force-91, Durnity Damon Bureau lodged the first information report after inquiring into the matter but the accused petitioner was not named in the said first information report and subsequently he was implicated in the charge sheet.<br/><br/>From the charge sheet it appears that the petitioner put his signature only in the office file, a mere routine work, prepared by the office assistant. Section 202 of the Customs Act, 1969 gave ample power for recovery of the amount from the persons who were wrongly paid money on 21.6.2011. The Customs authority filed a Certificate Case and the case being registered on 21.6.2011 being C.C. No. 94/Customs/11 for recovery of its demanded money under the provisions of Public Demand Recovery Act which is pending for disposal. No where either in the first information report or in the charge sheet, any allegation has been brought against the petitioner that he was a beneficiary or was benefited from the misappropriated sum of money Section 218 of the Customs Act, 1969 gave protection to the officers who act bonafide from criminal litigation and from the charge sheet it appears that the principal accused prepared documents and accused petitioner by putting his signature, approved the same and it is a settled principle that in such situation if the officer put his signature as routine work when the other things relating to preparation of documents are done by other employees, no criminal intention is disclosed and as such initiation of proceedings against the petitioner is an abuse of the process of the Court and is liable to be quashed.<br/>From the discussion above, we find that the further proceedings against the petitioner in the present case would be nothing but sheer abuse of the process of the Court and is liable to be quashed for ends of justice.<br/><br/>In the result, the Rule is made absolute.

Khoshnabish, Advocate-on-Record.<br/><strong>Respondent Nos. 2-8 :</strong> Not represented.<br/><br/><em><strong>Civil Appeal No. 99 of 2004</strong></em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong><u>Syed Mahmud Hossain, J: </u></strong></span><br/> <br/>This appeal by leave by the plaintiff-appellant is directed against the judgment and order dated 29.06.2003 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in F.M.A. No. 180 of 1998 restoring the same to its original file and number on vacating and recalling the judgment and order dated 26.02.2003 passed by the said Bench arising out of Miscellaneous Case No. 10 of 1997 of the Court of Fourth Subordinate Judge, Dhaka.<br/><br/>The facts leading to the filing of this appeal are summarized below : <br/>On 19.03.1979, the appellant herein as the plaintiff filed Title Suit No.128 of 1979 in the Court of First Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Dhaka, which on transfer to the Fourth Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka was renumbered as Title Suit No.304 of 1991 praying for specific performance of contract. His case, in short, is that on 02.01.1974, he  entered into a contract by executing a ‘bainapatra’ with Kamrunnessa, defendant No.1 for purchase of 33 kathas and two chattaks of land appertaining to mouza-Bhola Shamair at present Gulshan Model Town, plot No. NE(B) 9, Road No.74, P.S. Gulshan, Dhaka, for a consideration of Tk. 6,50,000.00. He paid Tk. 5,10,000.00 as earnest money and subsequently, on 13.03.1975 also paid Tk. 1,30,000.00 but defendant No.1 did not perform her part of contract such as taking permission from RAJUK for transferring the land in favour of the appellant. Defendant No.1 also denied the existence of the aforesaid bainapatra. In the suit, the plaintiff also prayed for setting aside the <em>ex parte</em> judgment and decree passed in Title Suit No. 545 of 1982 in respect of the suit property and also for declaration that the above <em>ex parte</em> decree is not binding upon him.  On the basis of forged and fraudulent documents and by practising fraud upon the Court defendant No.8 obtained the above <em>ex parte</em> decree. <br/><br/>Defendant Nos. 1-8 contested the suit by filing written statement denying the material statements made in the plaint. Their case, in short, is that on 04.07.1996, the suit was decreed <em>ex parte</em> directing defendant No.1 to execute and register the deed of sale in favour of the plaintiff in respect of the land of bainapatra within 90 days on receipt of the remaining balance amount, in default, the Court would execute and register the deed of sale. His further case was that the judgment and decree passed in favour of defendant No.8 in Title Suit No. 545 of 1982 was set aside holding that those were obtained by practicing fraud upon the Court  and it was also declared that those were not binding upon the plaintiff. In Execution Case No.11 of 1996, the Court executed and registered the deed of sale in favour of the plaintiff whereupon the plaintiff filed a petition before the RAJUK for mutation of his name and the RAJUK then mutated the said plot in the name of the plaintiff.<br/><br/>Defendant No.8, who is respondent No.1 in this civil petition obtained <em>ex parte</em> decree in the above Title Suit No. 545 of 1982. After that, he filed an application under Order IX Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure before the learned Subordinate Judge, (now Joint District Judge) Fourth Court, Dhaka, praying for setting aside the above <em>ex perte</em> decree dated 04.07.1999 passed in the above Title Suit No. 304 of 1991 in respect of the decree of specific performance of contract though he was not a party to the bainapatra dated 02.01.1974.  The learned Subordinate Judge by judgment and order dated 03.03.1998 rejected the same.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and order of rejection dated 03.03.1998, defendant No.8 as the appellant filed F.M.A. No. 180 of 1998 before the High Court Division in which plaintiff-respondent-appellant appeared. The High Court Division by an order dated 04.01.2000 dismissed the appeal for default.<br/><br/>Respondent No.1 herein filed a petition for restoration of the above appeal and a Division Bench of the High Court Division by an order dated 09.02.2002 restored the said appeal on condition of payment of cost of Tk.5,000/- within a month and in default, “the appeal shall stand dismissed”. Subsequently, the date of payment was extended upto 03.04.2002 with a direction to deposit the said amount in the Account of Registrar, Supreme Court. But defendant No.8 failed to deposit Tk.5000.00 within the stipulated time. The appellant herein, in the meantime, filed an application for setting aside the above order of restoration dated 09.02.2002 because of non-payment of Tk.5000.00 within time. Upon hearing the said application, a Division Bench of the High Court Division by an order dated 18.12.2002 dismissed F.M.A. No. 180 of 1998 observing that in view of unsatisfactory conduct of appellant-respondent No.1 and for non compliance of the repeated orders of the High Court Division, the appeal be dismissed for default. Subsequently, on 26.2.2003, the High Court Division again restored the appeal to its original file and number and directed the appellant to deposit a sum of Tk.5,000.00 within 7 days.<br/><br/>Feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the  order dated 29.06.2003 passed by the High Court Division, the plaintiff moved this Division by filing Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1074 of 2003 in which this Division granted leave on 24.03.2004 resulting in the initiation of Civil Appeal No.99 of 2004.<br/><br/>Mr. M. G. Bhuiyan, learned Advocate-on-Record, appearing on behalf of the appellant, submits that the Fist Miscellaneous Appeal was dismissed for non- compliance of Court’s order and as such, there was no scope for restoring the First Miscellaneous Appeal to its original file and number.<br/><br/>Mr. S. R. Khoshnabish, learned Advocate-on-Record, appearing on behalf of respondent No.1, on the other hand, submits that the First Miscellaneous Appeal was restored to its original file and number by the order dated 29.06.2003 because respondent No.1 complied with the direction of the Court and as such, no interference is called for.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates-on-Record, the impugned order restoring the First Miscellaneous Appeal to its original file and number and the materials on record.<br/><br/>Leave was granted to consider whether the appellant had any latches in prosecuting the First Miscellaneous Appeal before the High Court Division and whether under the facts and circumstances, the High Court Division was justified in restoring the First Miscellaneous Appeal to its original file and number.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the First Miscellaneous Appeal came up for hearing before a Division Bench of the High Court Division on 04.01.2000 and was dismissed for default as none appeared for the appellant. However, the learned Advocates for the respondents were present before the Court. As soon as respondent No.1 came to know about the dismissal of the appeal, he filed an application for setting aside the order of dismissal dated 04.01.2000 and prayed for restoring F.M.A. No.180 of 1998 to its original file and number. On 09.02.2002, another Division Bench of the High Court Division allowed the application with a cost of Tk. 5000/- to be paid within one month, in default, the appeal would stand dismissed. Respondent No. 1 stated to have approached Mr. Zakir Hossain, Advocate to accept the cost of Tk.5000/-. But the learned Advocate refused to accept that amount with an endorsement “I am no longer the Advocate of the respondent who is now represented by Mr. Azizul Huq, learned Advocate, retired District Judge, now attachment with Mr. Moinul Hossain, Advocate.”<br/><br/>The learned Advocate for respondent No.1 then approached Mr. Azizul Huq, Advocate, who was not agreeable to receive the costs. After that, respondent No.1 filed an application before the High Court Division for according him permission to deposit Tk.5000/- in the account of the Registrar of the Supreme Court. On 03.04.2002, a Division Bench of the High Court Division allowed the application. The Registrar of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh expressed his inability to accept the amount on the ground that he did not have any account to keep that money and consequently, the appellant was unable to deposit Tk.5000/- in compliance with the Court’s order.<br/><br/>The relevant section of the High Court Division on 09.06.2002 noted, “এমতাবস্থায় উল্লেখিত ৫০০০/- টাকা জমা দেওয়ার ব্যাপারে কি ব্যবস্থা গ্রহন করা যায় সদয় আদেশের জন্য মাননীয় দ্বৈত বেঞ্চ পেশ করা হইল”| On 15.06.2002, the matter appeared before a Division Bench of the High Court Division which passed the following order: “The office is directed to proceed henceforth in accordance with law to make the appeal ready for hearing.”<br/><br/>On 18.12.2002, the respondent-appellant filed an application for dismissal of the appeal for non compliance with the Court’s order. On 18.12.2002, a Division Bench of the High Court Division dismissed the appeal for non-compliance with the Court’s order. On 08.02.2003, appellant-respondent No.1 filed an application for readmission of the appeal before a Division Bench of the High Court Division. On 26.2.2003, a Division Bench of the High Court Division restored the appeal vacating the order dated 18.12.2002 and directing respondent No.1 to pay an amount of Tk. 5000/- to the learned Advocate for the contesting respondent-appellant against proper receipt within one week, in default, the appeal would stand dismissed. On 01.03.2003, respondent No.1 offered the amount of Tk.5000/- to Mr. Habibullah, learned Advocate for the respondent-appellant but he refused to accept the amount on the ground that against the order dated 26.02.2003 restoring the appeal to its original file and number, the respondent-appellant would prefer a civil petition for leave to appeal before this Division. In fact, the respondent-appellant obtained an interim order of stay from this Division on 05.03.2003 in Civil Miscellaneous Petition No. 93 of 2000 staying the operation of the order dated 26.02.2003 passed by the High Court Division restoring the First Miscellaneous Appeal to its original file and number for a period of two months and the respondent-appellant was directed to file regular leave-petition within that period failing which the order of stay would stand vacated. Because of the interim order of stay passed by this Division on 05.03.2003, appellant-respondent No. 1 declined to accept the amount of cost. What is important to note here is that respondent-appellant did not file any regular civil petition for leave to appeal according to the order of the learned Judge-in-Chamber and as such, the order of stay passed by the learned Judge-in-Chamber automatically stood vacated. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the First Miscellaneous Appeal was dismissed for non-compliance with the order dated 26.02.2003 according to the office note dated 12.03.2003 of the concerned section of the High Court Division. On 21.06.2003, Mr. Habibullah, learned Advocate for respondent-appellant, however, accepted the amount of Tk. 5000/- on furnishing proper receipt.<br/><br/>After that, appellant-respondent No.1 filed an application for readmission of the First Miscellaneous Appeal to its original file and number after recalling the order dated 12.03.2003. A Division Bench of the High Court Division restored the appeal to its original file and number by the impugned order dated 29.06.2003. Challenging the order dated 29.06.2003, the respondent-appellant filed Civil Miscellaneous Petition No. 93 of 2003 before this Division in which leave was granted resulting in Civil Appeal No. 99 of 2004.    <br/><br/>The chronological facts discussed before show that appellant-respondent No.1 had no laches in prosecuting the appeal. In the light of the finding made before, we do not find any substance to interfere with the impugned order.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed without any order as to costs. <br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Abdul Wahhab Miah, J:</u></strong></span><br/><br/>Delay is condoned.<br/><br/>The State has filed this petition for leave to appeal against the judgment and order dated the 28<sup>th</sup> day of February, 2010 passed by the High Court Division in Death Reference No.113 of 2005 heard analogously with Jail Appeal Nos.899 of 2005 and 900 of 2005 rejecting the death reference and dismissing the jail appeals, maintaining the order of conviction of the respondents passed by the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal No.1, Daman Case No.80 of 2003, but altering the sentence to one under section 302 of the penal Code and sentencing each of them to suffer imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of taka 2000.00 each, in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 6(six) months more.<br/><br/>Facts essential for disposal of this leave petition are that two respondents-Siddiqur Rahman and Sumon @ Megha (hereinafter referred to as the accused) were put on trial before the Tribunal in Nari-0-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Case No. 80 of 2003 and were charged under section 9(2)(3) of the Nari-0-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000(the Ain, 2000) to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/><br/>The case of the prosecution as stated by PW1, the informant, (hereinafter referred to as the PW) was that on 12.10.2000, at about 7:00 p.m., his younger brother informed him that his sister-Rahima Khatun was not traceable. The PW along with his relatives searched Rahima in different places, but Rahima was not found. At 10:00 p.m., Samad and Ojufa informed the PW that in the afternoon, they saw Rahima and the accused going through the D.R. dairy farm. On such information, the PW searched Rahima in the Dairy Firm area, but she was not found. Then, the PW catne back to his house and went to the house of the accused and asked their guardians about their whereabouts, but they could not give their whereabouts. He went to bed after 1 o'clock in the night and woke up at the time of Azan. On 13.10.2000, the accused came from two different Directions (দুইজন দুই দিক থেকে আসে); at about 6:00 a.m., accused-Megha told the PW that he watched VDO the whole night and accused-Siddique told that he listened songs. On going to the place where VDO was watched by accused Megha, no VDO was found. The PW and his brother-in-law, Rahman detained both the accused and then took them to the house of Badsha Mia, a U.P. Member. At the house of Badsha Mia, the PW, his brother-in-law and the other people, enquired of the accused about Rahima and thev first told that they had handed over her to a boy at Kaliakoir. On such information, the PW went to Kaliakoir, but they did not find Rahima there and came back in the evening. Thereafter, the respectable people of the locality called the accused and enquired of them about Rahima and they confessed to them that they raped Rahima and killed her by throatling and kept the dead body at the jungle by the side of BLR. Then, the PW informed the police station and went to the said place along with the police and the accused showed the dead body. Thereafter, the dead body was recovered from the jungle and then the First Information Report (FIR) was lodged with the police station.<br/><br/>The prosecution in all examined 8(eight) witnesses to prove the charges. The prosecution witnesses were duly cross-examined by the defence. No witness was examined on behalf of the defence.<br/><br/>The case of the defence as it appears from the trend of the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses and the examination of the accused under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (the Code) was that they were innocent and were implicated in the case falsely and that they were not involved with the alleged offences of committing rape and killing Rahima Khatun. The Tribunal on conclusion of the trial by the judgment and order dated the 25<sup>th</sup> day of July, 2005 found the accused guilty under section 9(2)(3) of the Ain, 2000 and sentenced each of them to death. The Tribunal submitted the proceedings of the case to the High Court Division under section 374 of the Code for confirmation of the death sentence. It was registered as Death Reference No. 113 of 2005. The accused also filed Jail Appeal Nos.899 and 900 of 2005 before the High Court Division. A Division Bench of the High Court Division on hearing the death reference with the jail appeals rejected the reference, dismissed the jail appeals, maintained the order of conviction, but altered the sentence under section 302 of the Penal Code from section 9(2)(3) of the Ain, 2000 and sentenced each of the accused to suffer imprisonment for life and also to pay a fine of taka 20,000'00 each, in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 6(six) months more.<br/><br/>Mr. Ekramul Haque, learned Deputy Attorney General, appearing for the State, has taken objection as regards the alteration of the sentence of the accused by the High Court Division to one for imprisonment for life under section 302 of the Penal Code from that of death sentence under section 9(2)(3) of the Ain, 2000 awarded by the Tribunal. He submits that the High Court Division was totally wrong in coming to the finding that "the prosecution failed to prove the charge of rape on Rahima by the two accused punishable under section 9(2) and (3) of the Nari-0-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000." and on such erroneous view converted the conviction into one under section 302 of the Penal Code. He further submits that in coming to the above finding the High Court Division solely relied on the opinion of the doctor given in the post mortem report that "No sign of recent sexual intercourse was seen" ignoring the confessional statements of the accused that they first raped Rahima and then killed her and also on misconception of the provisions of section 9(2)(3) of the Ain, 2000 and as such, the impugned judgment and order calls for interference by this Court by giving leave.<br/><br/>We have gone through the evidence on record and the other materials. It appears that the entire prosecution case rests on the confessional statements of the accused. Both the accused made confessional statements under section 164 of the Code categorically stating that they raped Rahima one after another. The Tribunal as well as the High Court Division found the confessional statements of the accused voluntary and true and accordingly, they relied upon their confessional statements. From the impugned judgment and order, it appears that the High Court Division disbelieved the prosecution case of commission of rape by the accused upon the victim relying on the opinion of the doctor that "no sign of recent sexual intercourse was seen." Therefore, it is pertinent to see whether the High Court Division was correct in taking the said view relying on the opinion of the doctor given in the post mortem report. And to see this, it is necessary to consider the confessional statements of the two accused. The relevant portions of the confessional statements of the two accused are as follows:</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;"><br/><strong>সুমন ওরফে মেঘা</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">‘‘আমি লেখা পড়া জানি না। Victim রহিমা আমাদের পুর্ব পরিচিত। তার নানার বাড়ি লাল মনির হাট। ছিদ্দিক অমার মামাতো ভাই এর বন্ধু। তার কথায় ঘটনার তারিখ গত ১২/১০/২০০০ Victim রহিমাকে লালমনির হাটে পৌটে দেয়ার জন্য ছিদ্দিকের সাথে বেরহই। ডাইরী ফার্ম হয়ে নবীনগর যাই। সেখানে ছিদ্দিক বলে টাকা আছে। আমি  বলি  টাকা নেই। ফলে আমরা লালমনির হাট যেতে পারিনি। রাত ৯/৯.৩০টা হয়ে যায় বিশ মাইল চলে আসি। এখানে এসে Victim কে বাড়ি চলে যাবার জন্য বলি কিন্তু সে কোন মতেই যেতে রাজি হয়নি। ফলে আমি ছিদ্দিক ও (ছেড়া) রহিমা রাতে বি,এল,আর,আই এর দেয়ালে পার্শ্বে জংগলে ঢুকে পড়ি।<br/>আমরা তিনজনই রাতে এক সাথে অবস্থান করি। Victim রহিমার সাথে অবৈধভাবে মেলা মেশা করি। সে প্রথমে রাজি হয়নি। আমরা তাকে রাজি করি। প্রথমে আমি rape করি তার পর আসারী ছিদ্দিক অবৈধ মেল মেশা করে। Victim ভোরে আবার ও লালমনির হাট পৌছে দৌার চন্য পিড়া পিড়ি করে। না নিয়ে গেলে গাড়ীতে চাপা খেয়ে মারা যাবে বলে। ভোরে এ ব্যাপার নিয়ে আমরা ধসত্মাধসিত্ম করি। আমরা মুখে চাপা দিয়ে দীর্ঘক্ষন ধরলে মেয়েটি মারা যায়। সকালে বাড়ি আসি লোকজন এসে আমাদেও ধৃত কওে এবং অটক করে রাখে। তাদের পিড়া পিড়িতে আমরা ঘটনা স্বীকার করি। ঘটনাস্থলে যাই এবং Victim রহিমার লাশ নিয়ে থানায় আসি। এই আমার বক্তব্য। লাশ সনাক্তের সময় পুলিশ সাথে ছিল।’’<br/> </div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;"><strong>ছিদ্দিকুর রহমান</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"আমার নাম ছিদ্দিকুর রহমান। স্বাক্ষর দিতে জানি। Victim রহিমা আমার পূর্ব পরিচিত। স্বামীর বাড়িতে থাকেনা। তার নানার বাড়ি লালামনির হাট। সেখানে পৌছে দেবার জন্য আমাকে প্রায় বলে। ঘটনার দিন গত ১২/১০/২০০০ তারিখ আমি ও আমার বন্ধু সুমন ওরফে মেঘে মুক্তাদেও বাড়িতে বসে T.V. দেখছিলাম। Victim আমাদের কাছে আসে এবং বলে চলো আজ আমাকে আমার নানার বাড়ি পৌছে দিবে। তার পিড়া পিড়িতে আমি রাজি হয়ে যাই। Victim রহিমা তৈরী হয়ে আসে এবং Victim সুমন ওরফে মেঘা এবং আমি বিকাল অনুঃ ৩/৩.৩০টায় বাড়ি থেকে বের হয়ে যায়। ডেইরি ফার্ম হয়ে নবীনগর। আমি নবীনগর এসে সুমন বলে যে তার কাছে টাকা নেই। তখন আমরা বিশমাইল নামক স্থানে ফিরে আসি। রাত ৯/৯.৩০টা হয়ে যায়। মেয়েকে আমরা বলি বাড়ি চলে যাবার জন্য কিন্তু সে বাড়ি যেতে পারবেনা জানিয়ে দেয়। ফলে বাদ্য হয়ে তাকে নিয়ে অমরা B.L.R.I. দেয়ালের পার্শ্বে জঙ্গলে চলে যাই এবং সেখানে সারারাত অবস্থান করি। সুমন এসে মেয়েটাকে ধর্ষণ করে। অর্থ্যাৎ মেয়ের সাথে অবৈধ কাজ করে। তার পর আমি করি। একবার করেছি। ভোর হয়ে যাবার পর আবার অনুরোধ করি বাড়ি চলে যাবার জন্য কিন্তু সে রালি হয়নি। নানার বাড়ি পৌছে দিতে হবে। নতুবা সে গাড়ীর নীচে পড়ে মারা যাবে। তখন তার সাথে ধসত্মাধসিত্ম করে মুখ চেপে ধরি। ফলে মেয়েটি মারা যায়। অমরা বাড়িতে ফিরে আসার সাথে (২) লোকজন ধৃত করে এবং আটকিয়ে রাখে। পরবতিতে ঘটনা স্বীকার করি। ঘটনাস্থলে যাই এবং Victim কে উদ্ধার করি। সেখান থেকে থানায় আসি। এই আমার বক্তব্য।"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From the confessional statements, it is very much clear that both the accused categorically stated that they raped Rahima after taking her in the jungle by the side of the wall of B.L.R.I one after another. Besides, the confessional statements, the accused also made extra-judicial confessional statements before PWs 1, 4 and 5 as to the fact that they also raped Rahirna before killing her.<br/> <br/>Admittedly in this case, the doctor who held the autopsy, was not examined and the post mortem report was admitted into evidence under section 23 of the Ain, 2000 and was marked as exhibit-8. In view of the clear confession of both the accused in judicial and extra-judicial confessional statements that they raped Rahima, it is not understood as to how the doctor could give the opinion that "No sign of recent sexual intercourse was seen." Thoughfit is a well settled proposition of law that the contents of the inquest report cannot be termed as evidence, in other words, the inquest report cannot be treated as substantive evidence, yet they can be looked into to test the veracity of the witnesses and equally can be looked into also to see the truth of the confessional statements of the accused. And in the instant case, we consider it necessary to look into the contents of the inquest report in view of the opinion of the doctor in the post mortem report that "no sign of recent sexual intercourse was seen." In the inquest report, it has been clearly mentioned that "‡hŠbv‡½ ex‡h©i mv`v `vM Av‡Q ewjqv g‡b nq" And this clearly corroborates the confessional statements of the accused that they raped Rahima on the fateful night. (It is also a settled legal proposition that the post mortem report is not a substantive piece of evidence and it is just like other corroborative evidence and it cannot be accepted as a conclusive proof as to the cause of death of a deceased and a Court can discard the opinion of the doctor if it contradicts the ocular evidence in the case which appears to be credible, cogent and trustworthy and the doctors concerned failed to hold the autopsy properly and gave fanciful opinion;) In the instant case, although the doctor, who held the autopsy, opined that the death of Rahima was caused "due to respiratory following asphyxia caused by strangulation by throatling which was anti-mortem and homicidal in nature" which is quite in line with the confessional statement of the accused opined that no sign of recent sexual intercourse was seen and such opinion is totally contradictory to the confessional statements both judicial and extra-judicial of the accused. When the accused themselves confessed in their confessional statements about the fact of committing rape upon Rahima before killing her, which were true and voluntary, the High Court Division ought not have accepted the opinion of the doctor that "no sign of recent sexual intercourse was seen" as a conclusive proof of the fact that Rahima was not raped and come to the finding that the prosecution failed to prove the charge of rape on Rahima by the accused. In the context, it may be stated that the records do not show that the accused even ever attempted to retract from the confessional statements made by them at any stage of the trial. We do not find any reason to disbelieve the said confession of the accused that they raped Rahima relying on the opinion of the doctor that "no sign of recent sexual intercourse was seen." Considering the confessional statements of the two accused, the High Court Division itself came to the finding as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>"We find that two accused persons corroborated the statements of </em><em>each other -with regard to the material particulars of the alleged </em><em>occurrence in to to implicating themselves in the alleged offence of </em><em>rape and murder."</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Considering the testimonies of PWs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7, the High Court Division further found:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>"We find that the evidence of witnesses are uniform with regard to </em><em>the extra-judicial confession so made by the two accused persons as to the actual manner of causing rape and killing the victim Rahima Khatun. The prosecution witnesses appear to be natural and truthful and there is nothing to discard their evidence. We do no find any reason to disbelieve their evidence on record. "</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In view of the above, the finding of the High Court Division that the prosecution failed to prove the charge of rape on Rahima by the two accused punishable under section 9(2)(3) of the Ain, 2000, does not stand correct factually and legally.<br/> <br/>The confessional statements of the two accused show that they killed Rahima after they had committed rape upon her. In this regard, we also need to consider sub-sections (2) and (3) of section-9 of the Ain, 2000 vis­a-vis the confessional statements of the accused. The sub-sections are as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>৯। ধর্ষণ, ধর্ষণজনিত কারণে মূত্য, ইত্যাদিও শাসিত্ম।-<br/>(২) যদি কোন ব্যক্তি কর্তৃক ধর্ষণ বা উক্ত ধর্ষণ পরবর্তী তাহার অনাধিক কাযকলাপের ফলে ধর্ষিতা নারী বা শিশুর মৃত্যু ঘটে, তাহা হইলে উক্ত ব্যক্তি মৃত্যুদন্ডে বা যাবজ্জীবন সশ্রম কারাদন্ডে দন্ডনীয় হইবেন এবং ইহার অতিরিক্ত অন্যূন এক লক্ষ টাকা অর্থদন্ডেও দন্ডনীয হইবেন;<br/>(৩) যদি একাধিক ব্যক্তি দলবদ্ধভাবে কোন নারী বা শিশুকে ধর্ষণ করেন এবং ধর্ষণের ফলে উক্ত নারী বা শিশুর মৃত্যু ঘটে বা তিনি আহত হন, তাহা হইলে ঐ দলের প্রত্যেক ব্যক্তি মৃত্যুদন্ডে বা যাবজ্জীবন সশ্রম কারাদন্ডে দন্ডনীয় হইবেন এবং হহার অতিরিক্ত অন্যূন এক লক্ষ টাকা অর্থদন্ডেও দন্ডনীয় হইবেন;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>A. reading of the second clause of sub-section (2) of section 9 clearly   তাদের অনাধিক কার্যকলাপের ফলেÓ. In the instant case, both the accused stated in their confessional statements that they raped Rahima and she died when they had pressed her mouth for long (মুখে চাপা দিয়ে দীর্ঘÿন ধরলে) after wrestling (ধসত্মাধw¯Í) in the morning as she did notagree to go to her house and insisted to take her to the house of her maternal grand- father at Lalmonirhat. We are of the view that rthe acts of the accused in pressing the mouth of Rahima for long resulting her death cleqarly come within the meaning of the words “তাহার অনাধিক কার্যকলাপের ফলে ধর্ষিতা নারী বা শিশুর মৃত্যু ঘটেÓ used in sub-section (2) of section 9 of the Ain,2000.) But the High Court Division totally failed to consider the said language used in second clause of sub-section (2) of section-9 of the Ain, 2000 vis-a-vis the confessional statements of the accused that they raped the victim and the contents of the inquest report that যৌনাঙ্গে বীর্যের সাদা দাগ আছে বলিয়া মনে হয়|Ó and thus fell into an error in not maintaining the order of conviction under section 9(2) of the Ain, 2000 and altering the sentence awarded against the accused under section 302 of the Penal Code. However, in view of the confessional statements of the accused as discussed above, sub-section (3) of section 9 of the Ain, 2000 is not at all attracted. Therefore, the Tribunal was not correct in finding the accused guilty under sub-section (3) of section 9 of the Ain, 2000 and the order of conviction of the accused under this sub-section cannot be sustained.<br/><br/>It appears that the age of the two accused at the time of occurrence was 17 and 18 years respectively. The High Court Division rightly commuted the sentence of death awarded by the Tribunal to imprison-ment for life considering their age.<br/><br/>Be that as it may, for the error committed by the High Court Division as pointed out hereinbefore, we are not inclined to grant leave in the matter as that would not ultimately yield any result varying the order of conviction of the accused of the charges brought against them under section 9(2) of the Ain, 2000. It may be stated that the accused have not filed any leave petition against the judgment and order of the High Court Division maintaining the order of conviction passed against them by the Tribunal for the murder of Rahima.<br/><br/>In view of the above, this leave petition is disposed of in the following terms:<br/><br/>The words "but the sentence awarded to the condemned prisoners Sumon and Siddique is altered to one under section 302 of the Penal Code" in the operating portion of the impugned judgment and order are expunged. The order of conviction dated 25.07.2005 passed by the Nari-0-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal No.l, Dhaka under section 9(2) of the Ain, 2000 is maintained; the order of conviction passed by the Tribunal under sub-section (3) of section 9 of the Ain, 2000 is set aside; the commutation of sentence to imprisonment for life from the death sentence as awarded by the High Court Division against the accused is maintained.<br/><br/><strong>        Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>
