Abu Tariq, J:</u></strong></span><br/><br/>On an application under Section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, the defendant petitioner challenged the legality and propriety of the impugned judgment and decree dated 27.09.2001, passed by the learned Sub-ordinate Judge, Artharin Adalat, Barisal, in Title Appeal No. 192 of 2000, reversing the judgment and decree dated 27.08.2000, passed by the learned Assistant Judge, Banaripara, Barisal, in Title Suit No. 04 of 1998, dismissing the suit.<br/>The opposite party, as plaintiff, filed a Title Suit No. 4 of 1998 against the defendant petitioners, in the Court of Assistant Judge, Banaripara, Barisal for declaration that the order dated 23.7.1997 passed by the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) Barisal, in Rin Salishi Appeal No. 443 of 1990-1991 in respect of the Schedule ‘Ka’ land of the plaint is illegal, null and void, fraudulent and without jurisdiction and as such the same is not binding upon the plaintiff.<br/><br/>The case of the plaintiff in short is that the plaintiff purchased 88 ½ decimals of land by kabala dated 10.4.1984 at a  consideration of Tk. 20,000/- from the defendant No. 1 and while possessing the said land mortgaged the same in Agrani Bank on 4.7.1988. The defendant No. 1 filed the Rin Shalishi Case No. 189 of 1989-1990, after promulgation of Rin Salishi Ain in 1989, claiming the property on the ground that he has got no land excess to 2 acres. The Rin Salishi Board upon hearing both the parties  dismissed the said case on 23.4.1991 finding that the defendant No. 1 has got the quantum of land excess to 2 acres. Being aggrieved by the said order defendant No. 1 preferred Rin Shalishi Appeal No. 443 of 1990-1991 before the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), as appellate Court, Barisal. The Additional Deputy Commissioner (Rev) after hearing the parties allowed the appeal on 23.07.1997, holding that the order of Rin Salishi Board is illegal, and without jurisdiction. It is further stated in the plaint that the claim of the defendant No. 1  is not tenable in the eye of law and a false claim. He has  earlier received consideration money as recited in the deed of kabala and sold the land as such the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) passed the order on 23.7.97 illegally and hence, the suit.<br/><br/>The defendant No. 1 contested the suit by filing written statements contending, inter alia, that the land in question was sold by the defendant No. 1, to the plaintiff for the necessity of his life on account of natural calamity and he has got no land excess to 2 acres and as such filed the case No. 189 of 1989-1990 which was illegally rejected by the Rin Salishi Board on 23.4.1991. Against which Rin Salishi Appeal No. 443 of 1990-1991 was preferred by this defendant, the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Barisal allowed the appeal considering all the legal aspects. Since, the Additional Deputy Commissioner(Revenue) as appellate authority has got the lawful jurisdiction to dispose of the appeal the suit is not maintainable having other remedy provided in law.<br/><br/>After hearing of both the parties, the learned Judge of the trial Court dismissed the suit vide judgment and decree dated 27.8.2000. Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid judgment and decree, the plaintiff as appellant preferred Title Appeal No. 192 of 2000.  After hearing of both the parties the learned Judge of the Court of appeal below allowed the appeal and decreed the suit vide judgment and decree dated 27.9.2001.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and decree as passed by the Court of appeal below, the defendant petitioner filed this instant revision and obtained the Rule.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Debdas Samadder appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that the impugned judgment and decree suffers from gross illegality on account of not being the proper judgment of reversal, not reversing the decision of the trial Judge on material points and as such there had been error in the decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/><br/>He further submits that the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) is the competent appellate authority constituted by Rin Salishi Ain in 1989, has got lawful authority to dispose of the Rin Salishi Appeal No. 443 of 1990-1991 and as such Civil Court cannot entertain such a suit against such an order of Rin Salishi Appellate Authority. The suit is not maintainable in law as provided by “ h¡wm¡­cn GZ p¡¢mn£ BCe 1989” and  non-consideration of such legal proposition led the Court of appeal below to commit error in the decision as per law which has occasioned failure of justice.<br/><br/>He then submits that the reason and  findings of the trial Court as to the ownership of the defendant No. 1, relating to quantum of land not exceeding 2 acres, is not been reversed properly through accurate assessment by the Court of appeal below. The plaintiff is a party to the Rin Salishi proceedings as such the suit is not maintainable under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, same ought to have been filed under section 39 of the said Relief Act and as such the Courts below to arrive at an erroneous decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/><br/>No one appeared on behalf of the opposite-parties nor filed power.<br/><br/>I have considered the case of the opposite-parties. Their case is that the land in question was sold by the defendant No. 1 to the plaintiff and he has got no land excess to 2 acres and accordingly he had filed the Case No. 189 of 1989-1990 which was illegally rejected by the Rin Salishi Board on 23.4.1991. On appeal before the Rin Salishi Appeal No. 443 of 1990-1991 the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Barisal, allowed the appeal, considering all the legal aspect, having lawful jurisdiction to dispose of the appeal.<br/>I have heard the learned Advocate for the petitioner   perused the impugned judgment other materials on record.  Considered the case of the opposite parties.<br/><br/>It appears that the plaintiff filed the suit for declaration that the order dated 23.07.1997, passed by the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Barisal in Rin Shalishi Appeal No. 433 of 1990-1991 is illegal, null and void. The trial Court dismissed the suit finding that:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“ মামলার জমি বাদী বরাবরে বিক্রেতা ১ নং বিবাদী ১৯৮৪ সনে হস্তান্তর করেন। বিরোধীয় আদেশ প্রদান করা হয় ইং ১৯৯৭ সনে। অর্থাৎ ইতিমধ্যে এ্রেতা মামলার জমি ১৩ বছর ভোগ দখল করিয়াছেন। তদকারনে ঋণ সালিশী আইন, ১৯৮৯ এর ৬ ধারার বিধান মতে বিক্রেতাকে বিক্রয় মূল্য ফেরত দেওয়ার আদেশ অপ্রয়োজনীয়। কারণ উক্ত ধারার বিধান মতে উক্ত তের বছর বাদী কর্তৃক ভোগ দখল করার পর পরিশোধ যোগ্য কোন অর্থ থাকে না। তদকারনে বিরোধীয় আদেশে এই মর্মে কোন কিছু উল্লেখ না থাকিলেও উহা দ্বারা উও্র আইনের বিধান লংঘিত হয় নাই।” </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The appellate Court reversed the said findings and   decreed the suit holding that:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“আদেশ পর্য্যালোচনায় দেখা যায় যে, অতিরিও্র জেলা কালেক্টর বরিশাল তর্কিত আপীলটি মঞ্জুর করিলেও উহাতে ঋণ সালিশী আইন ১৯৮৯ এর ৭ ধারার বিধান মোতাবেক সম্পত্তি প্রত্যার্পন সহ বিক্রয় মূল্যের টাকা কিভাবে পরিশোধিত হইবে সেই মর্মে আদেশ প্রদান করেন নাই। অর্থাৎ  তাহার আদেশটি অস্পষ্ট এবং তাহার আপীল মঞ্জুর আদেশ ৭ ধারার বিধানকে অনুসরণ করিয়া প্রদান করা হয় নাই। ”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Section 6 (1) of the Rin Shalishi Ain 1989 provides that:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“৬। (১) কতিপয় জমির বিএ্রয় খায়খালাসী বন্ধক ঘোষনা -(১) এই আইন বলবৎ হইবার পর অনাধিক তিন একর কৃষি জমির মালিক কোন কৃষক প্রাকৃতিক দুর্যোগে ক্ষতিগ্রস্থ হওয়ার বা জীবন ধারণে অক্ষমতাজনিত অসহায়তার কারণে কোন কৃষি জমি বিক্রয় করিলে এবং<br/>(ক) উক্ত জমির বিক্রয়মূল্য অনাধিক ত্রিশ হাজার টাকা হইলে অথবা সম শ্রেনীর জমির ক্রয়কালীন সময় সহানীয় বাজার দরের চেয়ে কম হইলে, এবং<br/>খ) বিক্রীত জমির পরিমাণ অনাধিক এক একর হইলে,<br/>উক্ত কৃষক বোর্ড গঠিত হইবার ছয় মাস, বা বিক্রয় দলিল রেজিষ্ট্রী হইবার ছয় মাস, যাহাই পরে হয়, এর মধ্যে উক্ত বিক্রয়কে খায়খালাসী বন্ধক হিসাবে ঘোষনা করিবার জন্য বোর্ডের নিকট বিধি দ্বারা নির্ধারিত পদ্ধতিতে দরখাস্ত করিতে পারিবেন এবং বোর্ড, দরখাস্তটি বিধি দ্বারা নির্ধারিত পদ্ধতিতে শুনানীর পর, দরখাস্তের যথাযর্থতা সম্পর্কে সন্তুষ্ট হইলে, উক্ত বিক্রয়কে সাত বৎসর মেয়াদী খায়খালাসী বন্ধক হিসাবে ঘোষনা করিবেঃ<br/>তবে শর্ত থাকে যে, উও্র জমি ১লা জানুয়ারী, ১৯৮৯ তারিখের পূর্বে পুনরায় হস্তান্তরিত হইয়া  থাকিলে বা ঐ তারিখের পূর্বে উহার উপর কোন শিল্প কারখানা, বাণিজ্যিক প্রতিষ্ঠান বা ইমারত সহাপনের বা অন্য কোন কারণে উহার প্রকৃতি সহায়ীভাবে পরিবর্তিত হইয়া থাকিলে, উক্ত জমির ক্ষেত্রে এ উপ-ধারার অধীন কোন দরখাস্ত গ্রহণযোগ্য হইবে না। ”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Under this provision the defendant petitioner made the prayer before the “Board” and the Board rejected his prayer. On appeal his prayer was allowed finally. The trial Court after assessing and reassessing the evidence that the defendant No. 1, petitioner has got the land, less than 2 acres and admittedly the value of the land incorporated of the kabala dated 10.04.1984 is 20,000/- (twenty thousand), which is less than 30,000/- (thirty thousand) so as per requirement of law,  defendant No. 1, petitioner filed the case before the Rin Shalishi Board and then to the Appellate authority under the provision of law and the matter has been finally and properly adjudicated upon. So in no way the Civil Court is entitled to entertain such prayer in a civil suit in as much as against the appellate Authority having other legal remedy is available in law.   <br/> <br/>In the instant case, the impugned order is an order of Rin Shalishi Appeal which has been declared null and void by a civil Court. But the “বাংলাদেশ ঋণ সালিশী আইন, 1989” provides that:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“১৯। আপীল (১) বোর্ডের সিদ্ধান্তর বিরুদ্ধে জেলার অতিরিও্র কালেক্টরের নিকট বিধি দ্বারা নির্ধারিত পদ্ধতিতে আপীল দায়ের করা যাইবে  এবং এই আপীলের উপর প্রদত্ত সিদ্ধান্ত চূড়ান্ত হইবে। ”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>So, it is apparent that Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Barisal, as appellate authority provided by an Act passed the order in question, which is final so the order in question is not challengeable to a civil Court. Resultantly, the present suit is not maintainable in the Civil Court and any decision of such court is without jurisdiction.<br/>The provisions provided in Section 24 of the Ain that:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“২৪। কতিপয় আইন অপ্রযোজ্য - এই আইনে ভিন্নরুপ বিধান না থাকিলে  Evidence Act 1872 (I of 1872) এবং Code of Civil Procedure 1908 (Act  V of 1908) এর বিধানাবলী বোর্ডের কার্যক্রমের ক্ষেত্রে প্রযোজ্য হইবে না।“</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>And that Section 26 of the Rin Shalishi Ain</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“২৬। সরল বিশ্বাসে কৃত কার্যক্রম রক্ষন এই আইন বা তদধীন প্রনীত বিধির অধীনে সরল বিশ্বাসে কৃত কোন কাজের ফলে কোন ব্যক্তি ক্ষতিগ্রস্থ হইলে বা তাহার ক্ষতিগ্রস্থ হইবার সম্ভাবনা থাকিলে, তজ্জন্য সরকার বা বোর্ডের চেয়ারম্যান বা সদস্য বা বোর্ড বা সরকারের কোন কর্মকর্তা বা কর্মচারীর বিরুদ্ধে কোন দেওয়ানী বা ফৌজদারী মামলা বা অন্য কোন আইনগত কার্যধারা দায়ের বা রুজু করা যাইবে না। ”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In view of such it is apparent that the Rin Shalishi Ain imposed clear bar, specifically to go for redress in Civil Court or any other Court on the part of the aggrieved party. There is no proof before the Court that the order in question is not passed in good faith in the appeal by the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue); So the suit is not maintainable in the Civil Court having the appropriate forum to challenge the same. <br/> <br/>On careful consideration of the impugned judgment of the lower appellate Court, the deposition as adduced by P.W. 1,  legal position in support of his case I find that as a final Court of fact the lower appellate Court is totally misdirected, misconceived and misconstrued in arriving at a correct finding without taking into consideration the legal provisions and the deposition as deposed before the Court of 1<sup>st</sup> instance. I don not find any ambiguity in the judgment of the learned trial Court who on proper appreciation of the oral and documentary evidences on record and also the materials on record did not commit any illegality in dismissing the suit. The impugned judgment and order of the lower appellate Court is manifestly illegal who at the time of passing of the impugned judgment  and order did not correctly appreciate and construe the documents and materials on record in accordance with law in reversing the judgment and order of the trial Court.<br/> <br/>On the above facts and circumstances of the case and discussions made hereinabove I am of the firm view that the learned Judge did not correctly appreciate and construe the documents and materials on record in accordance with law in reversing the judgment of the trial Court. Therefore, the   impugned judgment and order is liable to be set aside. Thus the Rule having merit succeeds.<br/> <br/>In the result, the rule is made absolute without any order as to costs. The impugned judgment and decree is set aside. The suit is thus dismissed.<br/> <br/>Send down the lower courts records along with a copy of this judgment to the concerned Court at once for information and necessary action. <br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Exercising this very power the courts can make transposition also of either of the parties of a suit or other proceeding to the other category of the parties and the courts also are doing so, and it has become a long practice now. Of course, generally, the courts will not allow transposition of defendants as plaintiffs after striking the names of the original plaintiffs or after transposing them as defendants.

The court allowed that application vide order dated 12.11.2007 and fixed  02.03.2008 for recording evidence of both the parties. Thereafter, the court recorded the evidence of the opposite party No.1, Mariam Begum since the petitioners side was absent. However, subsequently the court allowed the prayer of the petitioners to cross-examine the opposite party’s witness No.1, but without cross-examining the opposite party’s witness No.1, the petitioners, on 19.06.2008, filed an application under order XXIII rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure praying for withdrawal of the case. At the same time the added opposite parties also filed an application for transposing them as petitioners. The court, after hearing both the parties and considering the facts and circumstances, passed the impugned order dated 11-08-2008 allowing the prayer of the opposite parties to be transposed as  petitioners and rejecting the petitioners’ prayer for withdrawal of the case and also transposing the petitioners as opposite parties.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with that order of the court below the petitioners filed the above mentioned civil revision before the High Court Division and obtained rule. A Single Bench of the High Court Division ultimately, after hearing both the parties and considering the facts and circumstances, discharged that rule holding that the court below committed no illegality in rejecting the petitioners application for withdrawal of the succession case and allowing the opposite parties’ prayer for being transposed as petitioners and also transposing original petitioners as opposite parties in that succession case by the impugned judgment and order. Being aggrieved, the petitioners have filed this present Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal. <br/><br/>Mr. Fida M. Kamal, the learned Senior Advocate for the leave-petitioners has made submissions to the effect that order XXIII rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure has provided the right to these leave-petitioners to withdraw their succession case and that the petitioners filed an application to withdraw their succession case and in that circumstances the court ought to have allowed that application for withdrawal of the succession case. The learned Advocate has argued that by rejecting the prayer of these petitioners for withdrawal of their succession case the court below committed illegality. The learned Advocate has made submissions to the effect also that the added opposite parties-who claimed themselves to be the heirs of late Mr. A. K. Faizul Huq had scope to file a fresh succession case and in the circumstances the court below had no reason to transpose the added opposite parties as petitioners in the succession case filed by the present leave-petitioners. Mr. Fida M. Kamal has advanced argument to the effect also that there is no provision in any law for transposing the opposite parties as petitioners in any case and as such the transposition of the opposite parties as petitioners in the succession case of these leave-petitioners has been illegal. The learned Advocate has argued to the effect also that the succession case under Succession Act of 1925 being not a suit or even a miscellaneous proceeding the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure are not applicable in this succession case and as such the impleading of the  opposite parties in the succession case as per order I rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure also has been illegal.<br/><br/>Mr. Probir Niogi, the learned Advocate for the respondents has made submissions to the effect that there has been no violation of any provisions of any law at all in impleading the other heirs of late Mr. A. K. Faizul Huq as opposite parties in this succession case and subsequently in transposing them as petitioners in that succession case. The learned Advocate has argued that the trial court, on consideration of the facts and circumstances, rightly added the other heirs of late Mr. A. K. Faizul Huq as opposite parties in the succession case and subsequently transposed them as petitioners while the original petitioners wanted to withdraw from the said succession case and that the High Court Division, considering all these facts and circumstances, upheld the impugned order of the trial court rightly.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates of both the sides and gone through the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and also that of the trial court.<br/><br/>It appears that these leave-petitioners filed the succession case without disclosing the fact that their predecessor late Mr. A. K. Faizul Huq died leaving second wife and one son and one daughter by that second wife. But when the second wife and her children came to be added as parties in that succession case these leave-petitioners did not raise any objection and consequently they were added as opposite parties. Subsequently when the court fixed the case for hearing these leave-petitioners remained absent and consequently the court took evidence of one of the added opposite parties who also, as heirs of late Mr. Faizul Hoque were claiming succession certificate. These leave-petitioners then appeared before the court and prayed for cross-examining that OPW.1 and the court allowed that prayer but ultimately the leave-petitioners did not cross-examine the OPW.1, rather they filed the application for withdrawal of the succession case. In that circumstances the court rejected the application of these leave-petitioners for withdrawal of the succession case and allowed the application of the added opposite parties to be transposed as petitioners and also transposed these leave-petitioners as opposite parties in that succession case by the order dated 11.08.2008. It appears that the High Court Division, on consideration of all these above facts and circumstances, upheld this order of the trial court holding that there has been no illegality in this order. We also find no illegality in the order dated 11.08.2008 passed by the trial court and also in the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division upholding this order of the trial court.<br/><br/>Considering the facts and circumstances narrated above we do not accept the argument advanced from the side of the leave-petitioners that the trial court committed wrong and illegality by not allowing the leave-petitioners’ prayer for withdrawal of the succession case. By the impugned order the trial court transposed these leave-petitioners as opposite parties in that succession and also transposed added opposite parties as petitioners in that succession case which, in effect, resulted in withdrawal of their succession case for these leave-petitioners. The argument of the learned Counsel for the leave-petitioners that there is no provision in law for transposing petitioner as opposite party and opposite party as petitioner in any proceeding-also is not correct. Though there is no clear provision mentioning the word ‘transposition’ but order I rule 10(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure enables the courts to make such transposition, Order I rule 10(2) has empowered the courts to strike out name of any party, either plaintiff or defendant, improperly joined and also to add any persons-either as plaintiff or defendant-who ought to have been joined whether as plaintiff or defendant or whose presence before the court may be necessary for effectual and complete adjudication of the matter. Exercising this very power the courts can make transposition also of either of the parties of a suit or other proceeding to the other category of the parties and the courts also are doing so, and it has become a long practice now. Of course, generally, the courts will not allow transposition of defendants as plaintiffs after striking the names of the original plaintiffs or after transposing them as defendants. But in appropriate facts and circumstances-as these are in the present case-the courts should not be reluctant to make such transposition of the parties for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the court.<br/><br/>Mr. Fida M. Kamal has advanced argument to the effect also that Order I rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure is not applicable in a succession case which is neither a suit nor a proceeding as mentioned in section 141 of the Code of Civil Procedure and as such the impleading of the added opposite parties in this succession case was illegal. But we do not accept this argument also of the learned Counsel. Section 141 of the Code of Civil Procedure has provided that the procedure provided in the Code of Civil Procedure in regard to suits shall be followed, as far as it can be made applicable, in all proceedings in any court of civil jurisdiction. A succession case, in all consideration, is a proceeding in a court of civil jurisdiction. It needs to be mentioned here that these leave-petitioners themselves also filed the application for withdrawal of the succession case as per provision of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/><br/>However, in the circumstances narrated above the court below did not commit any wrong or injustice at all in transposing the added opposite parties as petitioners and the petitioners as opposite parties in the succession case after rejecting the petitioners application for withdrawal of that succession case. The withdrawal of the succession case, if had been allowed, these leave-petitioners would not have been benefited in any way, rather the withdrawal of this succession case would require the added opposite parties to file a fresh succession case causing abuse of the process of court.<br/><br/>However, we find no merit in this Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal and hence it is dismissed. <br/><br/><strong>End.</strong></div></div></div>

No.89 of 2003.<br/> <br/>The prosecution case, in brief, is that one Md. Emdadul Hoque (P.W.1) lodged a First Information Report, shortly, “FIR” on June 16, 2003 with Kishoregonj Police Station against the convict appellants along with five other accused alleging, <em>inter-alia</em>, that on August 14, 2002 Mst. Shahida Begum, daughter of the informant was married with the accused Azaharul Islam according to Islamic Law and also registered with Kabin-nama. After marriage Shahida Begum and her husband started their conjugal life at her husband's house. During the marital life the accused demanded Tk. 20,000/- as dowry, the father of Shahida did not give dowry at the time of marriage being refused, the accused tortured the victim. On may 15, 2003 at around 5.00 P.M. Shahidul Islam son of the informant along with Rashidul Islam (PW2) went to see Shahida at house of the accused and they saw that Shahida was assaulted by the accused. On asking the accused, they came to know that they (accused) assaulted Shahida for dowry. Shahidul Islam and others requested the accused not to assault her and they left the house of the accused. On May 15, 2003 Emdadul Hoque P.W 1 along with some witnesses went to the house of the accused Azaharul and saw the dead body of Shahida lying in the veranda. Next day at around 10.00 A.M he went to Kishorgonj Police Station where he was told by the Officer-in-charge that an Unnatural Death case had already been lodged by accused Mazidul about victim Shahida. After performing Post Mortem of the dead body he went to Police Station for lodging FIR but the O.C. refused to receive the FIR. Thereafter, he went to Court and filed the instant case.<br/> <br/>On the basis of the aforesaid FIR Kishoregonj Police Station Case No. 15 dated June 16, 2003  was lodged under sections 11(ka)/30 of the Ain, 2000 and section 201 of the Penal Code corresponding to G.R. No. 89 of 2003.<br/> <br/>Deceased Shahida Begum shall be described hereinafter as victim Shahida. Convicts Azaharul Islam and Mazidul Islam shall be described as convict-appellants.<br/> <br/>The Investigating Officer took the case for investigation; he visited the place of occurrence and prepared the Inquest Report of the dead body in presence of respective witnesses. He duly sent dead body of the victim to the Nilphamari Sadar Hospital, for Post Mortem. Post Mortem examination of the victim was performed by Dr. Abdul Mozid Sarker.<br/> <br/>Ultimately, on conclusion of investigation the Investigating Officer, submitted charge-sheet against the accused appellants along with five others under Sections 11(ka)/30 of the Ain, 2000 and section 201 of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/>Later, the case was duly sent to the concerned Tribunal for trial. Learned Judge of the Tribunal on taking cognizance of the offence against accused Azahrul Islam under section 11(ka) of the Ain, 2000 against accused Mazidul Islam under section 11(Ka) of the Ain, 2000 and section 201 of the Penal Code and against accused Shahdat, Mariam, Shabina, Atiar and Bhutto under section 11(ka)/30 of the Ain, 2000 framed charge against them. On being read over and explained the charge to the accused they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/> <br/>The defence case as it appears from the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses accused was innocent and the victim had died committing suicide. <br/> <br/>During the course of trial the prosecution produced as many as 12 witnesses including the Medical Officer and the Investigating Officer. The Tribunal after considering the evidence and materials on record found the accused Azaharul guilty under section 11(Ka) of the Ain, 2000 and sentenced him to death with a fine of Tk. 5,000/- and also found accused Mazidul Islam guilty under section 201 of the Penal Code and sentenced him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 5(five) years with a fine of Tk. 1,000/= in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for a further period of 1 (one) month while found five accused persons not guilty of offence under section 11(ka)/30 of The Ain of 2000 and verdict of acquittal delivered upon them by its judgment and order dated June 29, 2009.<br/> <br/>Death sentence matter has been referred to this Court by way of a Reference by Tribunal and the Reference has been noted as Death Reference No. 45 of 2009. Convict Azaharul Islam preferred a petition of Appeal from Jail which has been Numbered as Jail Appeal No. 455 of 2009. The convict appellant Mozidul Islam also carried a petition of Appeal being registered as Criminal Appeal No. 5541 of 2009.<br/> <br/>Death Reference, Criminal Appeal and Jail Appeal are heard together and are disposed of by this single judgment.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Atiqul Hoque (Salim) along with Mr. Nizamul Hoque Nizam, the learned Assistant Attorney General appeared in support of the Reference. While no one appears on behalf of condemned prisoner as state defence lawyer. Mr. Azizul Islam, the learned Advocate appeared on behalf of convict Majidul Islam in Criminal Appeal No. 5541 of 2009 and Ms. Sayeda Sabina Ahmed, the learned Advocate appeared on behalf of Azaharul Islam in Jail Appeal No. 455 of 2009.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Atiqul Hoque (Salim), the learned AAG, submits that the prosecution had successfully established his case beyond reasonable doubt and that the ingredients of the aforesaid special provision of law having been attracted the Tribunal duly found that the condemned-prisoner had committed the offence as alleged. He also submits that reason to disbelieve the witnesses nor the defence could shake the credibility of the witnesses. The story of the case is clearly suggests the involvement of the convict Azaharul with the offence. In this regard learned AAG contended that the victim was an innocent village house wife who did not have any enmity with anyone the alleged occurrence also took place after about 9 months of the marriage as meted out by the accused. Learned AAG insisted that a close reading of the statement of the P.Ws proved that he is solely responsible for the murder of victim Shahida. He finally submits that the Tribunal committed no error of law or facts in passing the judgment of conviction and sentence against the convict and, therefore, there is no justifiable reason to interfere with the impugned judgment and order passed by the Tribunal.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Azizul Islam, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of accused Mazidul Islam who took us through the FIR, and the entire evidence on records including the materials exhibit and submitted that the Tribunal fell into error of law in finding the accused guilty of the charge so levelled against him, for the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. He further submits that the accused has been implicated by the informant out of suspicion. Considering the same the Tribunal came to its findings merely upon conjectures and surmises, not upon legal evidence on records. <br/> <br/>Now, in order to appreciate the arguments advanced by the learned Advocates we would now discuss the evidence adduced by the prosecution in this case.<br/> <br/>P.W.1. Md. Emdadul Hoque stated that the occurrence took place on May 15, 2003 at about 5.00/6.00 P.M. at the house of  his son-in-law, accused Azaharul. At that time his nephew Shahidul Islam and son Rashidul came out from the house of his elder daughter Aziya Khatun  and on the way they went to the  house of accused Azharul and saw that the accused was verbally abusing his daughter Shahida. His son Shahidul  informed him that accused Azaharul had demanded money and being refused, the accused verbally abused Shahida. Thereafter, in the evening his son informed him that his daughter Shahida had been killed.  He went to the house of the accused  Azaharul Islam and saw the dead body of Shahida lying in the veranda. Next day at around 10.00 A.M he went to Kishorgonj Police Station where he was told by the Officer-in-charge that an Unnatural Death case had already been lodged by the accused Mazidul about victim Shahida. He further stated that after performing Post Mortem of the dead body he went to Police Station for lodging FIR but the O.C. refused to receive the FIR. Thereafter, he went to Court and filed the instant case. He proved the ejahar and his signature so endorsed thereon and marked as Exts 1 and 1/1 respectively. He had declared hostile and cross-examined by the prosecution. <br/> <br/>P.W. 2. Rashidul Islam stated that the occurrence took place on May 15,  2003 at around 4.00/4.30 P.M. and on the following day, afternoon, he along with his uncle Shahidul Islam, on the way to return back from the house of his sister Azia Khatun, they went to see his younger sister Shahida at her husband's house and then came back to their house. He had been declared hostile and cross-examined by the prosecution and defence. <br/> <br/>P.W.3. Md. Shahidul Islam stated that on May 15, 2003 at around 8.00 P.M. he received information that his niece Shahida had been killed in her husband's house. Next day, he went  to the house of the accused Azaharul and saw the dead body of Shahida. He heard that Shahida died of epilepsy. Prosecution declared him hostile and cross-examined. He denied the prosecution suggestion that it was not a fact that there was made a compromise between the informant and accused for which he gave evidence falsly.<br/><br/>P.W. 4. Emaz Uddin was tendered .<br/>P.W. 5. Amir Hamza was tendered .<br/>P.W. 6. Saiadar Rahman  was  tendered.  <br/>P.W. 7. Idris Ali was tendered.<br/>P.W. 8. Abdus Samad was also tendered.<br/>P.W. 9. Dr. Abdul Mozid Sarker stated that on May 17, 2003 he was stached to Sadar Hospital, Nirphamari as Medical Officer. On the following date, according to identification of Constable Abu Bakkar Siddique  he held the post mortem of the victim Shahida. During the post mortem, he  found the following injuries:</div><div style="text-align: justify;">One bruise about 3 x 2over right parietal and frontal region of head. Antemortem blood clots found over the right lateral part of chest 3 x 2 in lower part. Antemortem blood clots found underneath the injury.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">One bruise over the right lateral part of chest 3'' x 2'' in lower part. Antemortem blood clots found underneath the injury.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In his opinion the death was due to shock and heamorrhage as a result of above mentioned injures which was antemortem and homicidal in nature. He proved the post mortem report and his signature so endorsed thereon and marked as Exts 2 and 2/1 respectively.<br/> <br/>P.W.10. Md. Abu Bakar Siddique, Constable, stated that on May 16, 2003 at around 12.30 hour he went to the spot and was taken the dead body of the victim for post mortem. After held post mortem, he handed over the dead body. He proved the copy of the  chalan of the dead body and his signature so endorsed thereon and marked as Exts. 3 and 3/1 respectively.<br/> <br/>P.W.11. Md. Mortuza Ali <em>S.I</em> stated that on May 16, 2003 he was attached to Kishorgonj Police Station, Nilphamari. On the basis of the allegation of the informant the Officer-in-Charge (O.C) filled up the FIR form.  His (O.C) hand writing was known to him and he identified the FIR form as Ext. 4 and his signature as Ext. 4/1.  He further stated that on the basis of allegation, he started an Unnatural Death case and handed over the  same to A.S.I Kamal Mohan Chaki for investigation. He identified the U.D case and his signature so endorsed thereon and marked as Exts. 5 and 5/1 respectively.  <br/> <br/>P.W.13. Kamal Mohan Chaki stated that on May 16, 2003 he was attached to Kishorgonj Police Station, Nilphamari. He went to the spot and prepared the inquest report of dead body of victim Rashida. He proved the inquest report and his signature so endorsed thereon and marked as Exts. 6 and 6/1 respectively.<br/> <br/>In the case there is no ocular evidence witnessing the commission of crime by convict-appellant. Prosecution relied upon circumstantial evidence in proof of its case. It is always to be remembered that there is no law that commission of a crime must by witnessed by witnesses and they are to stand in witness box to prove the crime. Commission of crime can be also, well proved by circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence is more cogent and convincing than the ocular evidence. It is correctly said that witnesses may tell a lie and it is not difficult to procure false, tutored and biased witness but it was very much difficult to procure circumstantial evidence.<br/> <br/>Prosecution in proof of guilt of offence relied upon the following circumstances:</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;"><u>First Circumstance:</u> Deceased and convict-appellant were admittedly husband and wife and they lived in the same house at the time of commission of offence. Ordinarily an accused has no obligation to account for the death for which he is placed on trial but in a wife murder case position of law is altogether different. The murder having taken place while the convict-appellant was living with the deceased wife Shahida in the same house, the convict-appellant had an obligation to explain how his wife met with death. The plea adopted from the side of husband convict-appellant stood proved to be false. From the above, the legitimate conclusion that inevitably flows is that it is the husband convict-appellant who had killed his wife deceased Shahida.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><u>Second Circumstance:</u> Medical evidence: Dr. Abdul Mozid Sarker (PW 9) found   one bruise about 3 x 2 over right parietal and frontal region of head. Antemortem blood clots found over the right lateral part of chest 3 x 2 in lower part. Antemortem blood clots found underneath the injury. One bruise over the right lateral part of chest 3'' x 2'' in lower part. He recorded opinion that the victim died due to shock and heamorrage as a result of injuries which was atemortem and homicidal in nature.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><u>Third Circumstance:</u> Accused Mazidul brother of convict Azaharul was lodged an Unnatural Death case with the Kishorgonj Police Station in respect of the death of deceased Shahida. Strategy adopted by convict-appellant that victim died committing suicide and this conduct speaks volumes against him and inference of guilt of convict-appellant can be easily gathered.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><u>Fourth Circumstance:</u> False plea adopted by convict-appellant: Strategy adopted by convict-appellant that victim Shahida was died committing suicide. This plea stood totally nullified by medical evidence of Dr. PW.9. This false plea added an additional link to complete the chain of circumstance. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Circumstance noted above do not at all suggest innocence of convict-appellant rather formidably suggest his involvement in the murder of his wife deceased Shahida and all the circumstances taken together unerringly point to guilt of convict-appellant and the irresistible conclusion that flows is that convict-appellant is perpetrator of crime who killed his wife deceased Shahida.  <br/> <br/>This brings us to a legal aspect of the matter. Convict-appellant stood charged and convicted for offence of section 11(ka) of the Ain of 2000. Section 11(Ka) enjoins that if the husband of a woman or the father, mother, guardian, relations or any other person on behalf of the husband for dowry causes death to a woman or ventures to cause death or causes hurt or have a try to cause hurt that  husband, father, mother, guardian, relation or the person (a) shall stand sentenced to death for causing death or shall stand sentenced to imprisonment for life for mounting endeavour to cause death and in both the counts he shall be, also, liable to pay fine, and (b) shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life for causing hurt or be sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for a period not more than fourteen (14) years and less than five (5) years for striving to cause hurt and in both counts shall be liable to fine.<br/> <br/>In order to attract section 11(Ka) it is to be proved that death was caused in view of demand of dowry put forward from the side of husband or father, mother, guardian, or relation of the husband or any person for and on behalf of husband. <br/> <br/>In the case putting forward demand of dowry by convict-appellant could not be proved by legal evidence. The prosecution witnesses testify the demand of dowry by convict-appellant but the prosecution witnesses had totally given a go-bye to the prosecution case and betrayed the cause of the victim who was done to death by convict-appellant.<br/> <br/>From circumstantial evidence it had come to light that convict-appellant had caused the death of deceased and a clear case of murder had been brought home to the door of convict-appellant. <br/> <br/>This takes us to a legal debate of funda-mental character, which is,</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the convict-appellant can be graced with a verdict of acquittal when charge of section 11(Ka) of the Ain of 2000 could not be pressed into service against him.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">When a clear case of murder has been established by circumstantial and medical evidence against him whether the convict-appellant can be convicted for the offence of murder punishable under section 302 of the Penal Code.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the case is required to be sent back to Tribunal or Court of Sessions for fresh trial. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Section 25 of the Ain of 2000 postulates that Tribunal defined section 2 (Ghha=W) shall be treated as Court of Sessions and Tribunal shall be able to exercise all powers of Sessions Court in holding trial of an offence.<br/> <br/>Section 26 of the Ain of 2000 enshrines that Tribunal so constituted shall be recorded as Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal and shall be constituted with one Judge and Judge of Tribunal shall be appointed from amongst District and Sessions Judges to the Government and Government, if necessary, shall appoint any District and Sessions Judge as Tribunal Judge in addition to his charge. Section 20 further enjoins that under the section Additional District and Sessions Judge shall, also, stand included as District and Sessions Judge.<br/> <br/>From the above it becomes manifestly clear that a Tribunal trying a case under the Ain of 2000 is, also, a Court of District and Sessions Judge. When a Judge sits in a Tribunal or Special Tribunal Case holding trial of an offence under a Statute or Special Statute is a Tribunal or Special Tribunal and a Judge when sits in Sessions Case trying an offence punishable under Penal sections of Penal Code sits as Sessions Judge.<br/> <br/>The case in hand, although, tried by a Tribunal constituted under The Ain of 2000 that Tribunal was, also, the Court of sessions. In the judgment learned judge was described as Additional District and Sessions Judge, Nilphamari as well as Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Bishes Adalat, Nilphamari. Judgment demonstrates that learned Additional District and Sessions Judge had been, also, exercising the power and jurisdiction of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal. Fate of the convict-appellant and result of the case would have been the same whether it would have been tried either as a Nari-O-Shishu case by the Tribunal or as a Sessions case by learned Sessions Judge and if section 11(ka) of The Ain, 2000 was not attracted in respect of convict-appellant, the offence of section 302 of the Penal Code could be very much pressed into service against the convict-appellant and he could be conveniently tried and convicted for offence of section  302 of Penal Code. <br/> <br/>In <strong><em>Asiman Begum Vs State</em></strong> represented by <strong><em>Deputy Commissioner, 51 DLR(AD) 18</em></strong> the accused-appellant along with 6 others was put on trial before Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Bishesh Adalat, Patuakhali to answer a charge of section 10(1) of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain, 1995  in Nari-O-Shishu Case No. 2 of 1996. Accused-appellant was found guilty under the first part of section 304 of the Penal Code and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for four (4) years and, also, a fine of Taka 1,000 in default of payment of fine to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one (1) year more. A single Judge of High Court Division disposing of the Criminal appeal preferred by convict-appellant observed that the trial had been vitiated for want of jurisdiction inasmuch as Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishesh Bidhan) Adalat, could only try an offence under the aforesaid Bishesh Bidhan Ain, 1995 and not an offence under The Penal Code, learned Single Judge sent the case back on remand to learned Sessions Judge to try it in accordance with law. Before Appellate Division it was argued from side of accused-appellant that the remand order for trial of the case as a Sessions Case in the particular circumstances of the case will be a mere formality because Nari-O-Shishu Case No. 2 of 1996, although, tried under Bishesh Bidhan Ain, 1995 by a bishesh Adalat, the presiding officer was no other than the Sessions Judge himself and, as such, it was unlikely that the result would be anything different if the case was tried by him as a Sessions Case. Appellate Division found considerable substance in the submission of learned Advocate for accused-appellant. Appellate Division, thus sent the appeal to High Court Division to consider the case on merit and to pass whatever order or orders it might think appropriate in the interest of justice.<br/> <br/>In <strong><em>State Vs Abul Kalam</em></strong>, <strong><em>5 BLC 230</em></strong> one Abul Kalam stood convicted for offence of section 10(1) of The Ain of 1995 for murder of his wife for dowry by learned Sessions Judge and Special Tribunal No. 1, Noakhali. Conseq-uential sentence was death. Condemned-prisoner preferred Jail appeal and, also, regular Criminal appeal before High Court Division. There had been, also, Death Reference. A Division Bench of High Court Division heard Death Reference, Jail Appeal and Criminal Appeal together and disposed of those by a common Judgment. High Court Division found that there had not been cogent evidence as to committing murder for dowry and no evidence had been led as to the real cause of killing of wife by husband and held that the case did not come under section 10(1) of The Ain of 1995 and the case comes under section 302 of The Penal Code. The High Court Division further held that Sessions Judge, in fact, was the Special Tribunal No. 1 who tried the case and for no fault of the accused the case had been tried as Special Tribunal Case. High Court Division instead of sending the case back for fresh trial under section 302 of The Penal Code by learned Sessions Judge disposed of the appeal. High Court Division altered conviction from section 10(1) of The Ain, 1995 to one under section 302 of Penal Code. Sentence of death was altered to one of imprisonment for life. The High Court Division in rendering decision took into account <strong><em>Asiman Begum vs State, (Supra).</em></strong><br/> <br/>A similar question was, also, considered in <strong><em>Shibu Pada Acharjee Vs. State, 56 DLR 285</em></strong>. In the said case, accused-appellant was convicted for offence of Section4(c) of The Ordinance of 1983 for commission of rape upon victim Ratna Rani but ingredients of Section 4(c) of the Ordinance of 1983 could not be brought home to accused appellant. In the case it had been laid down:<br/><em>“To take the prosecution out of Court on a question of technicality, will be a traversity of justice and technicality must bend to cause of justice inasmuch as Ends of law is justice”.</em><br/> <br/>Accused appellant can be fastened for offence of section 376 of the Penal Code and conviction under section 4(c) of The Ordinance of 1983 can be altered to one of section 376 of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/>In the said case conviction under section 4 (c) of the Ordinace of 1983 was altered to one of section 376 of the Penal Code. <strong><em>Asiman Begum vs State, (Supra) </em></strong>and <strong><em>State Vs Abul Kalam, (Supra</em></strong>) had been, also, discussed considered and meditated in <strong><em>Shibupada Acharjee vs State (supra).</em></strong><br/> <br/>In the event of sending the case either to Tribunal or Court of Sessions for fresh trial proceeding would be protracted which cannot be allowed in the interest of true dispensation of criminal Justice.<br/> <br/>Since offence of murder is punishable under section 302 of Penal Code was carried to the door of convict appellant he can be very much convicted for offence of section 302 of the Penal Code and, as such, we convert the offence of section 11(ka) of the Ain of 2000 to offence of section 302 of Penal Code. Convict appellant, thus stands convicted for offence of section 302 of the Code.<br/> <br/>Legal debate stands solved in the following terms and language:</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">Convict appellant can not be graced with a verdict of acquittal.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Convict appellant can be convicted for the offence punishable under section 302 of the Penal Code</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Case is not required to be sent either to   </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">      Tribunal or Court of Sessions for fresh trial.<br/> <br/>What sentence is to be imposed upon convict-appellant—death or imprisonment for life?<br/> <br/>Sentencing discretion on the part of a Judge is the most difficult task to perform. There is no system or procedure in the Criminal Justice administration method or Rule to exercise such discretion. In sentencing process, two important factors come out which shall shape appropriate sentence a. Aggravating factor, and b. Mitigating factor. These two factors control the sentencing process to a great extent. But it is always to be remembered that the object of sentence should be to see that the crime does not go unpunished and the society has the satisfaction that justice has been done and Court responded to the society’s cry for justice. Under section 302 of The Code, though, a discretion has been conferred upon the Court to award two types of sentences, death or imprisonment for life, the discretion is to be exercised in accordance with the fundamental principle of criminal justice.<br/> <br/>Convict-appellant is aged about 25 years when he was examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Record indicates that convict-appellant is not a hard criminal and he cannot be at all characterised to be a menace to the society. Taking an account of aggravating and mitigating circumstance, we are of this considered view that ends of justice will be met if death sentence is altered to one at imprisonment for life. Convict-appellant thus, stands sentenced to imprisonment for life. Convict-appellant, also, is to pay a fine of Taka 5,000/-and in default of payment of fine to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 6(six) months more.<br/> <br/>The prosecution failed to prove the charge against the accused Mazidul Islam. He may be acquitted.   <br/> <br/>On the premises of the foregoing discussion, the following orders are passed:</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;">Death Reference No. 45 of 2009 is rejected.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Jail Appeal No. 455 of 2009 stand dismissed with modification of conviction and sentence. Judgment of conviction and sentence dated June 29, 2009 passed by Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Nilphamari in Nari-O-Shishu Case No.430 of 2003 is modified in the epithet that convict-appellant is found guilty of the offence of section 302 of Penal Code and not for an offence of section 11(ka) of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 and conviction for offence of section 11(ka) of The Ain of 2000 is altered to one of section 302 of The Penal Code and death sentence is altered to one of sentence of imprisonment for life and he is to pay a fine of Tk. 5,000/- and in default of payment of fine to undergo rigorous impris-onment for six (6) months more. Out of this awarded sentence the quantum of sentence he has already served out shall be deducted on the application of the provision of section 35A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The period in custody before commencement of Trial and after commencement of Trial be deducted from the total sentence under section 35A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Jail Superintendent, Nilphamari is directed to shift the condemned-prisoner from death cell into the common accommodation for the convict-person. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Criminal Appeal No. 5541 of 2009 is allowed. If he (Mazidul Islam) was not found guilty of charge, he is acquitted. He is discharged from bail bond as he enjoyed previous bail. Let a copy of the judgment be sent to the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Nilphamari.<br/><br/>Send down the lower court records at once.<br/><br/>Communicate this order at once.<br/><br/><strong><em>End.</em></strong></div></div></div>
