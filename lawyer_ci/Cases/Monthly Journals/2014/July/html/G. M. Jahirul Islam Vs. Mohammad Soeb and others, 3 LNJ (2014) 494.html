Plaintiff is an employer of Forest Department of the Government. He came to the locality time to time from his work place to personally take care of his properties including the schedule ‘Kha’ property. While serving at Kare Hat under Mirersorie being transferred there in December 1996, he went to the suit land on 14.02.1997 and found that the defendant Nos. 1-3 illegally entering into the ‘Kha’ schedule land under the title and possession of the plaintiff mobilizing construction materials and cutting earth for construction wall. Being asked by the plaintiff defendant No. 1 stated that their father purchased the ‘Kha’ schedule land and while enjoying title and possession started construction work. Plaintiff told respondent No. 1 that his father has not purchased the land under serial No. 9 instead he was purchaser of the plot under serial No. 10 and subsequently the plaintiff filed the suit for declaration as well as recovery of khass possession and own the alongwith allegation in their plaint.<br/> <br/>That the defendant Nos. 1-7 contested the suit by filing written statement denying all the materials allegation of the plaint and stating inter-alia that the suit is not maintainable and it was further stated that which is possessing by the defendant are the purchased land and he denied the possession of the plaintiff. It was further stated that the suit was not maintainable want of partition as because the defendant are of co-sharer of the said khatian including other allegation there in their written statement. Thereafter the learned trial Court pass an order to inspect the land in question through an Advocate Commissioner who after holiding inspection submitted report which is annexed with the application as Annexure A at the time of trial the plaintiff adduced their evidence in support of their case and on the other hand, the defendant adduced evidence including the documentary evidence from both the sides and after taking evidence from the citation and perusal the record the trial Court was pleased to decree the suit and against which the defendant as appellant preferred title appeal and on hearing the learned lower appellate Court was pleased to allow the appeal on the ground that the land in question was not specific and further reason that the suit was not maintainable due to want of partition and against the said judgment and decree the petitioner preferred this present revisional application and obtained the present rule.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Shamsul Haque Bhuiyan, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that the learned lower appellant Court failed to consider the specific possession of the plaintiff petitioner and thereby it committed an error of law resulting in an error in his decision occasioning failure of justice. He further submits that the rule may be absolute.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Afzal Hossain, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the opposite parties submits that the specification of the land neither in the plaint nor in the report which was exhibited in where the title of both the parties are admitted but land of the plaintiff was not ascertained neither by the plaint nor by the advocate commissioner therefore the sketch map prepared by the advocate commissioner was not proper not in accordance with rules and even he has no experience about the survey of the land in question therefore on the basis the said report it is not safe to pass any judgment. He lastly submits that the rule may be discharged.<br/> <br/>Heard the learned Advocate, perused the materials on record as well as survey report itself which is annexed as Annexure A  and the learned Advocate who after making inspection submitted his report categorically stated that he was not a survey knowing advocate and he did not prepared the sketch map though there is mentioning about a sketch map in the  averment of the plaint practically we do not find any such sketch map along with the plaint that the  advocate commissioner also did not prepared any sketch map for the land in question. The relevant portion of the advocate commissioner’s report is as under,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<u>পরিদর্শনের প্রস্তাবিত বিষয়াদি ও ফলাফলঃ-</u><br/>বিষয়ঃ-      ১) আর্জির সহিত সংযোজিত কলমি নক্সায় প্রদর্শিত মতে বিরোধীয় দাগের সম্পত্তি বিভক্ত এবং সীমানা দেওয়াল দ্বারা উহা পরিচিহ্রিত কিনা? উত্তর হ্যাঁ হইলে ১-১২ নং প্লটের আয়তন সহ সীমানা দেওয়ালের বিস্তারিত বর্ণনা প্রদান করুনঃ<br/>ফলাফলঃ  হ্যাঁ, বাদীর বিজ্ঞ কৌশুলীর সরবরাহকৃত কলমি নক্সায় প্রদর্শিত মতে বিরোধীয়  দাগের সম্পত্তি বিভক্ত এবং সরেজমিনে পাকা সীমানা দেওয়াল দ্বারা পরিচিহ্রিত করা আছে।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>This material fact disclosed that there was sketch map along with the plaint but practically there is no sketch map and on the other hand the commissioner report speaks that the sketch map was supplied by the learned Advocate which is totally contrary.<br/><br/>It further appears that he did not prepared the sketch map by himself and the learned Advocate for the petitioner brought are notice that the writ was delivered by the learned Advocate only to make inspection without preparing any sketch map by the advocate commissioner. After considering the report of the advocate commissioner along with the evidence on record as discussed above we find that the preliminary point to determine the land in question is quite absurd and in such facts and circumstances to determine the preliminary point as to attraction of the plaintiffs land with the land in question is required to determine and for which it requires to make inspection by a survey knowing advocate commissioner and it also is required to prepare the sketch map with index.<br/><br/>It appears that since the title of the parties are admitted but the possession as well as the position of the land is required to be determined by the Court and that is why it requires to make an inspection of the suit land by a well survey knowing lawyer who after holding inspection prepared the sketch map and index and submitted report in accordance with law to determine the preliminary point in question along with other evidences by the Court.<br/>In view of the above facts and circumstances, we find that the ends of justice would be met if the suit is send back on remand to determine the preliminary point after appointing a survey knowing advocate commissioner for holding inspection and report along with map and index in accordance with law. <br/><br/>In the result, the rule is made absolute without any order as to costs. Both the judgment and decree dated 21.05.2008 and 28.05.2008 passed in the Other Appeal No. 361 of 2006 by the Additional District Judge, Bankruptcy Court, Chittagong and the judgment and decree dated 21.06.2006 and 28.06.2006 respectively passed by the Joint District Judge, Environment Court, Chittagong in Other Suit No. 02 of 2006 are hereby set aside and the suit is send back on remand to the court of the joint District Judge, Environment Court Chittagong and the trial Court is directed to appoint a survey knowing advocate commissioner for holding inspection and report along with sketch map and index in accordance with law and the learned Judge is also directed to trial the suit thereafter in accordance with law within 04 (four) months from the date of receipt of this judgment and order of this court.<br/><br/>Send down the lower Court records together with a copy of the judgment and order of this court to the court below at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>
