Later, the stay passed by this Court was stayed by the Appellate Division.<br/><br/>The common facts leading to the issuance of the Rules, in brief are:-<br/><br/>The petitioners are the leading construction companies of the country and are involved in re-construction of various landmark buildings and infrastructure projects in Bangladesh. They are the pioneers in the construction of roads and highways in Bangladesh and have undertaken construction of large infrastructure development projects in the Roads and Highways department and have successfully completed a number of projects. The Dhaka-Chittagong main road is one of the busiest highways in Bangladesh. The highway is used by importers and exporters to deliver goods to and from Chittagong and Dhaka. It is also used to interconnect Chittagong-Dhaka with Comilla and Feni. But because of single lane, this highway has been considered extremely dangerous for the users. Considering the urgency of four lanning highways, the present Government undertook a project and invited tenders from the prospective bidders. In response to an international tender for pre-qualification published in various newspapers on 29.10.2005, the petitioners submitted its proposal to participate in the bidding process of four lanning of Dhaka-Chittagong Highway Project. By a letter being Memo No. 4LP/ Tender /882 dated 10.3.2008 issued by respondent No. 3, the petitioners were informed that they were pre-qualified to submit tender for the project. In pursuance of the said letter, the petitioners were invited to submit sealed tenders for the execution and completion of the project. The Ministry of Communication by its letter dated 27.3.2008 directed respondent Nos. 2 and 3 to follow the Public Procurement Act 2006 (shortly, the Act, 2006) and the Public Procurement Rules, 2008 (shortly, the Rules, 2008). The petitioners purchased the tender documents for 10 sets of total package but according to law they were eligible to be awarded only one package. After purchase of the tender documents, the petitioners were notified about the pre-bid meeting for the clarification on the tender documents. According to the tender documents, the pre-bid meeting was held on 8.4.2008. The petitioner submitted the tender accompanied by security money for each package and other supporting documents. They were present at the tender opening ceremony and after opening of the tenders, the documents were sent to the Tender Evaluation Committee (TEC) which after due deliberation and consideration of the proposals submitted by the bidders found the tenders of the petitioners competitive and responsive. Accordingly, TEC recommended to take next necessary steps. Considering the report of the ‘TEC’, respondent No. 2 also recommended that the Ministry of Communication was to take next steps and proceed to award the tender to the successful bidders. While the petitioners were eagerly waiting for the notification of award in the form of Letter of Acceptance, they received the impugned letter bearing No. Unnayan-1/Dha-Cha-4 Lane-2/2008-462 dated 7.7.2008 issued by the Ministry of Communication canceling the whole tender on a flimsy ground of not providing 28 days period for submission of performance guarantee of the tender document at TDS (Tender Data Sheet Clause 37.1) they provided for 7 days’ time only. Respondent No. 2 also directed to re-process the procurement activities afresh. The cancellation of the tender by the Ministry of Communication is without lawful authority and such cancellation is also against the public interest. In the aforementioned circumstances, the petitioners served notice demanding justice upon the respondents on 13.7.2008 for withdrawal of the impugned letter, but of no avail.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by, and dissatisfied with, the impugned order dated 7.7.2008 passed by respondent No. 2, the petitioners moved this Court and obtained the instant Rules Nisi.<br/><br/>The petitioner in Writ Petition No. 5404 also submitted supplementary affidavit. In that affidavit it has been stated that the opinion of the Ministry of Law Justice and Parliamentary Affairs was sought for and that the Ministry gave its opinion stating that 7 days time for submitting performance guarantee was not violative of the Rules, 2008 or the Act, 2006. In another supplementary affidavit filed by the petitioners, it has been stated that the Cabinet Division by its notification bearing No. Mo:Pa: Be:/Sha-Kro:A:/Kroei-20/2008-347 dated 7.8.2008 formed a 2(two) -member committee to enquire into the matter and submit report to the Cabinet Division.<br/><br/>In Writ Petition No. 5404 of 2008, the petitioner also submitted a supplementary affidavit in which it annexed the report of the enquiry committee constituted by the Cabinet Division.<br/><br/>Respondent No. 3 entered appearance by filing affidavit-in-opposition controverting all the material allegations made in the Writ Petitions. The case of respondent No. 3, in short, is that the Department of Roads and Highways invited tenders for Dhaka-Chittagong 4-laning project. Subsequently, the Government cancelled the tenders and asked respondent No. 2 to arrange for re-tender, vide memo No. Unnayan-1 Dhaka-4 lane-2/2008-462 dated 7.7.2008. Violating the Rules, 2008, respondent No. 2 gave 7(seven) days’ time instead of 28 days for submission of performance guarantee. As a result, the Government rightly cancelled the tender. According to the Rules, 2008, Procuring Entity floats tender, TEC evaluates and recommends on the Tender and send its opinion to the Head of the Procuring Entity (shortly, HOPE) and thereafter, HOPE sends the evaluation report to the Ministry with its comments.  The Ministry reserves the right to make comments on the recommendation of the HOPE. The Ministry of Communication examined and scrutinized all the facts and found deviation of the Rules, 2008. Accordingly, it cancelled the tender and directed respondent No. 2 for re-tender. Rule 102(7) of the Rules, 2008 clearly stipulates that for international tender, the successful tenderers shall be allowed to submit the performance guarantee within 28 days. But in violation of the Rules, 2008, the Procuring Entity gave 7 (seven) days’ time for submission of performance guarantee. Therefore, the Ministry rightly cancelled the recommendations of the TEC and directed respondent No. 2 to invite re-tender. The replacement of 28 days by 7 days for submission of performance guarantee is a clear violation of Rule 102(7) of the Rules, 2008. In fact, the Government took the decision rightly as per the Rules, 2008. The petitioners have not acquired any vested right and as such, they are not the aggrieved persons to file the instant Writ Petitions. For the reasons stated, the Rules are liable to be discharged.<br/><br/>The petitioners also filed affidavit-in-reply against the affidavit-in-opposition filed by respondent No. 3. In that affidavit-in-reply the petitioners stated that they did not violate the Act, 2006 or the Rules, 2008. Respondent No. 1, the Ministry of Communication had no authority to cancel the tender of the project. On the contrary, under Rule 33 of the Rules, 2008, the Procuring Entity is authorized to cancel the tender if such cancellation is recommended by the TEC.<br/><br/>Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud and Mr. Tanjib-ul Alam, learned Advocates appeared on behalf of the Writ Petition Nos. 5404 of 2008, 5405 of 2008, 5406 of 2008 and 5408 of 2008. Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud  submits that the Ministry of Communication did not have the authority to cancel the tender as the TEC recommended acceptance of the tender. He further submits that the authority can cancel the tender if one of the conditions of Rule 33 of the Rules, 2008 is violated. He again submits that in the instant case none of the conditions of the Rule 33 of the Rules, 2008 was violated and as such cancellation of the tender was illegal. He also submits that considering all aspects, the TEC recommended acceptance of the tender, but without forwarding the report of the TEC to the purchase committee, the Ministry of Communication most illegally cancelled the tender. He lastly submits that such cancellation of tender by the Ministry of Communication is a flagrant violation of the Rules, 2008 and the Act, 2006 and as such, the impugned order is bad in law and can not sustain in law.<br/><br/>Mr. Fida-M-Kamal and Mr. Tanjib-ul Alam, learned Advocates appeared on behalf of the petitioner of Writ Petition No. 5407 of 2008. Mr. Fida-M-Kamal adopt the submissions of Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud and adds that as per clause 34.1 of the tender documents, the Procuring Entity reserves the right to cancel the tender and that the Ministry of Communication did not have the authority to cancel the same.<br/><br/>Mr. Salauddin, learned Attorney General appearing on behalf of respondent No. 3, submits that according to the tender documents, the Government reserves the right to accept or cancel any of the tenders without assigning any reason. He refers to clause 34.1 of the tender and submits that the Procuring Entity reserves the right to cancel the tender and that the Chief-Engineer of the Road and Highways being the Procuring Entity reserves the right to cancel the same. He again submits that there has been a flagrant violation of the Rules, 2008 and that the Act. 2006. He also submits that the authority did not issue any work order in favour of the petitioners and that the petitioners did not acquire any vested right. He lastly submits that as the petitioners did not acquire any vested right they cannot maintain the instant Writ Petitions and, as such the Rules are liable to be discharged.<br/><br/>We have perused the Writ Petitions, its annexures, supplementary affidavits, its annexures, affidavit-in-reply, its annexures and affidavit-in-opposition and its annexures.  <br/><br/>It appears that in response to an international tender for pre-qualification published in various newspapers on 29.10.2005, the petitioners submitted their proposals for pre-qualification to participate in the bidding process of 4-lanning of Dhaka-Chittagong High Way Project. By a letter dated 10.3.2008, respondent No. 3 informed the petitioners that they (petitioners) qualified to participate in the bidding of the project and that they (petitioners) were invited to submit sealed tenders. The Ministry of Communication directed respondent Nos. 2 and 3 to follow the Rules, 2008 and the Act, 2006.<br/><br/>It is true that Dhaka-Chittagong main road is one of the busiest highways in Bangladesh and that it is the only route connecting Dhaka and Chittagong. The importers and the exporters use the highway to deliver the goods to and from Chittagong and Dhaka. The highway is also used to interconnect Chittagong and Dhaka with Comilla and Feni. But because of single lane, this highway has been considered extremely dangerous and as such, the Government considering the urgency of 4-lanning the highway undertook a project and invited tender from the prospective bidders. In total, 18 persons participated in the pre-qualification biding. Of 18, 5 were foreigners, 10 local and 3 joint venture. The pre-bid meeting held on 8.4.2008. The authority informed the petitioners that they were qualified in the pre-bid. The petitioners attended the tender opening ceremony. The documents were sent to the TEC which after due deliberation and consideration of the proposals submitted by the bidders found the tenders of the petitioners competitive and responsive. Accordingly, the TEC recommended to take further necessary steps. Considering the TEC report, respondent No. 2 recommended that the Ministry of Communication was to take necessary steps and award the tender to the successful bidders. When the petitioners were eagerly waiting for the notification of award, the Ministry of Communication all on a sudden, cancelled the tender on the ground that instead of giving 28 days for submission of performance guarantee, the authority gave 7(seven) days’ for the same. The petitioners challenged this action of the Ministry of Communication.  <br/>We find that the petitioners mainly challenged the action of the Ministry of Communication. The learned Advocate for the petitioners contended that the Ministry had no jurisdiction to cancel the tender. It appears from the record that the Ministry of Commu-nication cancelled the tender primarily on the ground that there had been a violation of the Rules, 2008 and that the Act, 2006. The Procuring Entity did not allow the tenderers 28 days time for submission of performance guarantee as provided in the Rules, 2008 and the Act, 2006. Violating the Rules, 2008 and the Act, 2006, the Procuring Entity gave the tenderers only 7(seven) days time instead of 28 days.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the estimated cost of the project is over Tk. 55 crore. So, the power of acceptance of the tender lies with the Cabinet Division (Purchase and Economic Section). When the question arose whether the Ministry of Communication had jurisdiction to cancel the tender, the Cabinet Division formed a 2-member committee to enquire into the matter.<br/><br/>The notification issued by the Cabinet Division (Purchase and Economic Section) reads as follows.  </div><div style="text-align: center;"><br/>গণপ্রজাতন্ত্রী বাংলাদেশ সরকার<br/>মন্ত্রী পরিষদ বিভাগ<br/>ক্রয় ও অর্থনৈতিক শাখা<br/>প্রজ্ঞাপন<br/>ঢাকা, ০৭ আগষ্ট, ২০০৮/২৩ শ্রামন, ১৪১৫<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">নং-মপবি/শা-ক্রঃঅঃ/ক্রয়-২০/২০০৮-৩৪৭ ঢাকা-চট্রগগ্রাম মহাসড়ক ৪ লেনে উন্বীতকরণ প্রকল্প (দাউদকান্দি-চট্রগ্রাম অংশ) সড়ক নির্মান কাজের দরপত্র দলিলে পাবলিক প্রকিউরমেন্ট অ্যাক‘ট-২০০৬ এর  ধারা ১৪(খ) এবং পাবলিক পকিউরমেন্ট রুলস-২০০৮ এর ১০২(৭) বিধির ব্যত্যয় ঘটিয়ে কার্যসম্পাদন জামানত দাখিলের সময়সীমা ২৮ দিনের পরিবর্তে ৭ দিন করার কারনে সড়ক ও রেলপথ বিভাগ কর্তৃক গত ৭-৭-২০০৮  তরিখের উন্নয়ন-১/ঢাচ-৪ লেন-২/২০০৮-৪৬২ নং স্বারকমুলে দরপএটি পূণঃ প্রক্রিয়াকরণের জন্য সড়ক ও জনপথ অধিদপ্তরকে নির্দেশদেয়া হয়। কার্যসম্পাদন জামানত দাখিলের সময়সীমা ২৮ দিনের পরিবর্তে ৭ দিন রাখার কারণে পিপিএ-২০০৬ ও পিপিআর-২০০৮ এর কোন ব্যত্যয় ঘটেছে কিনা, ঘটলে তার পুনরাবৃত্তি কিভাবে হয়েছে এবং কোন প্রেক্ষিতে যথাযথ কর্তৃপক্ষেও অনুমোদন ব্যতিরেকে পূণঃ টেন্ডরের আদেশ দেয়া হয়েছে তার দায়-দায়িতবব নিরুপন করে একটি প্রতিবেদন আগামী ২(দুই) সপত্মাহের মধ্যে মমিএপরিষদ বিভাগে প্রেরনের  জন্য সরকার দুই সদস্যবিশিষ্ট নিম্নরুপ তদন্ত কমিটি গঠন করছেঃ-<br/><br/>(ক) কমিটির গঠনঃ-<br/>(১) জনাব এ, এম, এম, নাসিরউদ্দিন       সদস্য<br/>     সদস্য (ভৌত অবকাঠামো), পরিকল্পনা কমিশন<br/>(২) জনাব আব্দুস সোবহান শিকদার        সদস্য<br/>     ভারপ্রাপত্ম সচিব, বাস্তবায়ন পরিবীক্ষন ও মূল্যায়ন বিভাগ<br/><br/>(খ) কমিটির কার্যপরিধিঃ-<br/>(১) কার্যসম্পাদন জামানত দাখিলের সময়সীমা ২৮ দিনের পরিবর্তে ৭ (সাত) দিন রাখার কারনে পিপিএ-২০০৬ এবং পিপিআর-২০০৮ এর কোনরুপ ব্যত্যয় ঘটেদে কিনা এবং ঘটলে পূনঃ পূনঃ কিভাবে তা হয়েছে উক্ত তথ্য উদঘাটন এবং দায়ী ব্যক্তিদের সনাক্তকরণ ।<br/>(২) তদুপরি কোন প্রেক্ষিতে যথাযথ কর্তৃপক্ষেও অনুমোদন ব্যতিরেকে সড়ক ও রেলপথ বিভাগ কর্তৃক সড়ক ও জনপথ অধিদপ্তরকে পূনঃ টেন্ডারের আদেশ দেয়া হয় তা নিরুপন।<br/>(৩) দরপএ দলিল ও দরপত্র প্রক্রিয়ায় কোন ধরনের ক্রটি/বিচ্যুতি রয়েছে কনা তা নির্ধারণ।<br/><br/>(গ) তদনত্ম সংক্রান্ত কাজে বাস্তবায়ন পরিবীক্ষন ও মূল্যায়ন বিভাগ এ কমিটিকে সচিবিক সহযোগিতা প্রদান করবে । </div><div style="text-align: center;">রাষ্টপতির আদেশক্রমে<br/>স্বাঃ/ অস্পষ্ট ৭-৮-২০০৮<br/>(মোঃ মতিয়ার রহমান )<br/>যুগ্ম সচিব (কমিটি ও উনলয়ন)<br/>(Emphasis Supplied)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From the above notification, we find that the Cabinet Division (Purchase and Economic Section) formed a 2-member committee to enquire into the following matters:-</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The Procuring Entity gave 7(seven) days time to the successful bidders to submit performance guarantee instead of 28 days.

Since the Cabinet Division is in the seisin of the matter, we are, reluctant to interfere with the matter. Rather, we, are, inclined to direct the Cabinet Division to consider the report submitted by the 2-member committee and give its decision whether there has been any violation of the Rules, 2008 and the Act, 2006 and whether cancellation of tender and direction for fresh tender by the Ministry of Communication were legal or not.

Kamal Uddin, as first party filed BLL Case No. 273 of 2007 before the 1<sup>st</sup> Labour Court, Dhaka under section 132 (1) of the Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006 for getting termination and others benefits amounting to Tk. 1,19,000/- against the petitioner employer. The respondent no. 5, Ruhul Amin, who is the General Secretary of Bangladesh Sramik Songhati Federation has been authorized by the 1<sup>st</sup> party- respondent no. 4 to file and conduct the case on his behalf. The petitioner, being the employer of the respondent no. 4, entered appearance and contested the BLL case by filing written statement denying the material allegations made in the case. The petitioner filed an application before the 1<sup>st</sup> Labour Court, Dhaka stating, <em>inter alia, </em>that the conducting person being the respondent no. 5 Ruhul Amin is not a lawyer and as such he cannot appear before any Court including the Labour Court to conduct the case. The respondent no. 3, 1<sup>st</sup> Labour Court, Dhaka, on 14.9.2008, heard the said application filed by the petitioner and kept the same with the record holding that this issue has to be considered at the time of final hearing of the case. Subsequently, on 9.3.2009, the petitioner filed another application before the 1<sup>st</sup> Labour Court, Dhaka for dismissing the case stating, <em>inter alia, </em>that engaged representative of the 1<sup>st</sup> party, the respondent no.  5 has no right to file the case, conduct the same on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> party- respondent no. 4. Then the respondent no. 5, being the authorized person of the 1<sup>st</sup> party-respondent no. 4, filed written objection denying the material allegation of the petition contending, <em>inter alia, </em>that the self-same application earlier on 14.9.2008 was disposed of by the 1<sup>st</sup> Labour Court   and as such the Labour Court now has become functious officio particularly to dispose of the same application. The Labour Court, upon hearing the parties and on consideration of materials on record and the relevant Labour Law, rejected the said application filed by the petitioner. This Rule, at the instance of the 2<sup>nd</sup> party petitioner, is directed against the said impugned order dated 25.5.2009 passed by the 1<sup>st</sup> Labour Court, Dhaka.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Aminul Huq, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the  petitioner, submits that respondent no. 5, Ruhul Amin, has got no lawful authority to conduct the case on behalf of the respondent no. 4, Md. Kamal Uddin, as he is not an enrolled Advocate under the Bangladesh Legal Practitioners and Bar Council Order, 1972.<br/><br/>Mr. Huq submits further that though the respondent no. 5 as an authorized person on behalf of the respondent no. 4 conducting the case on his behalf under the provision of section 220 of the Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006, but he is conducting the same like a lawyer which is in contravention with the Bangladesh Legal practitioners  and Bar Council Order, 1972 and hence the impugned order allowing the respondent no.5 to conduct the case on behalf of the respondent no. 4  is liable to be declared to have been passed without lawful authority and is of no legal effect.<br/><br/>This Rule is contested by the respondent no. 5, Md. Ruhul Amin, the authorized person of the respondent no. 4 through Mr. Mansur Habib, learned Advocate, who filed affidavit in opposite on behalf of respondent no. 5. The learned Advocate for the respondent no. 5 drawing our attention to the provision of section 220 of the Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006 submits that the Labour Court did not commit any illegality in allowing the respondent no. 5 to conduct the case on behalf of the respondent no. 4 as the respondent no. 5 is an authorized person to do the same.<br/><br/>The main contention of Mr. Haque, learned Advocate, is that act and conduct of the authorized representative (respondent no.5) of the respondent no.4 is like a lawyer but without being enrolled as an Advocate, he cannot do so which is contravention of the Bangladesh Legal Practitioners and Bar Council Order, 1972. But the petitioner did not challenge the vires of the provision of section 220 of the Bangladesh Labour Law, 2006 wherein the provision of conducting a case by the authorized person has been enacted. In this regard it may not be out of place to note that for the purpose of disposal of this Rule we have to confine ourselves with the terms of Rule only.<br/><br/>Section 220 of the Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006 has clearly spelt out the provision of conducting case or cases by the authorized person or by an advocate. For better understanding the said provision of Section 220 is quoted below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>২২০ মামলার পক্ষগ­ণর উপস্থিতি (Appearance of parties)- সাক্ষ্য দেওয়ার জন্য উপস্থিতির ক্ষেত্র ব্যতীত অন্য কোন ক্ষে­ত্র আদাল­ত অথবা ট্রাইব্যুনা­ল কোন ব্যক্তির দরখাসস্ত পেশ হাজিরা প্রদান অথবা অন্য কোন কাজ তিনি স্বয়ং অথবা তাহার নিকট হই­ত লিখিত ভা­ব ক্ষমতাপ্রাপ্ত কোন প্রতিনিধি বা আইনজীবী করি­ত পারি­বনঃ</div><div style="margin-left: 40px;">তবে শর্ত থা­কে যে, উক্ত প্রতিনিধি বা আইনজীবী সংশ্লিষ্ট আদাল­তের কোন প্রতিনিধি হই­তে পারি­বেন না।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>On a perusal of the aforesaid provision of section 220 of the Act, it is found that the party himself or any person authorized in writing by the party or a lawyer duly appointed by the party can conduct a case in the Labour Court or the Tribunal, as the case may be. Provided that the said representative or lawyer shall not be a representative of the Court concerned. Considering the aforesaid provision of the Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006, we are inclined to hold that respondent no. 5, the authorized agent or representative of the respondent no. 4, has lawful authority to file and conduct the case before the Labour Court. We do not see any legal impediment of filing and conducting the BLL Case by the respondent no. 5, authorized agent of the respondent no. 4.<br/><br/>In view of the fact  and circumstances of the case and the provision of law we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order dated  25.5.2009 passed by the 1<sup>st</sup> Labour Court, Dhaka allowing the respondent no. 5 to conduct the B.L.L Case on behalf of the respondent no. 4 now pending in the 1<sup>st</sup> Labour Court, Dhaka. Accordingly we do not find any merit in the Rule and the Rule is liable to be discharged.<br/><br/>In the result, the Rule is discharged however without any order as to costs.<br/><br/>The order of stay granted at the time of issuance of the Rule is hereby recalled and vacated.<br/><br/>Since the matter is old one, the 1<sup>st</sup> Labour Court, Dhaka, is directed to proceed with the Bangladesh Labour Law Case No. 273 of 2007 in accordance with law and with utmost expedition.<br/><br/>Communicate the order at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

He was appointed as Assistant Director (Administration) in Bangladesh Agric-ultural Research Institute, Joydebpur, Gazipur (BARI) on 24.10.1990 and was promoted to the post of Senior Assistant Director (Administration) on 15.04.1996. In the meantime, he was transferred on deputation to the Bangladesh Agricultural Institute, Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, Dhaka under BARI in the post as Assistant Director (Senor Scale) (Administration) vide BARI Memo No. <strong>ব-১/৯৭/প্রসাশন/১৪৬৪</strong>  dated 02.09.1998 and was released on 10.09.1998 vide BARI Memo No.<strong> ব-১/৯৭/প্রসাশন/১৬৪১ </strong>dated 10.09.1998.<br/> <br/>The petitioner further stated that according to BARI Service Regulations 1990 <strong>(বাংলাদেশ কৃষি গবেষণা ইনস্টিটিঊটের কর্মচারী চাকুরী প্রবিধানমালা, ১৯৯০) </strong>the authority cannot issue an order for deputation without the consent of the employee. As the authority has not taken any consent of the petitioner and transferred him on deputation, he applied through proper channel for cancellation of the transfer order or deputation order to the Director General, BARI and also made represe-ntation several times. He also applied, on the ground that, due to his wife’s service at BARI School and his son/daughter being students of the said BARI School, his cause may be considered but without any result. By this time, the Bangladesh Agricultural Institute where the petitioner was deputed was abolished and upgraded as Ser-e-Bangla Agricultural University on 11.9.2001. According to the provision provided in Section 59 (2) (Ja) of Sher-e-Bangla Agricu-ltural University Act, 2001 the petitioner gave option to return to his original post of the parent department BARI also informed his appointing authority that the project would be ended on 30.6.2002 and applied for cancellation of his deputation order. Then the University authority sent the proposal to the Director General of BARI, as the petitioner’s appointing authority, to withdraw the petitioner from University after canceling the order of deputation. The Director General, BARI ultimately cancelled the deputation order by order dated 17.03.2005 (Annexure-M) released the petitioner from the said University.<br/> <br/>The petitioner accordingly joined in his original post, i.e. Senior Assistant Director (Administration) BARI after taking final release order from the Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University handing over charge on 17.03.2005. The said joining report of the petitioner was accepted by the Director General BARI and since then he has been serving and performing the functions of a Senior Assistant Director (Administration) and he has been paid salary up to May, 2005<br/> <br/>Though petitioner’s joining report was accepted by the Director General, BARI, but the Ministry of agriculture vide Memo No. <strong>কৃম-৩/চাকুরী (নিয়োগ)৩৭(বারি) ২০০৩/২৫৩</strong> dated 24.4.2005 (Annexure-O) cancelled the joining report of the petitioner with BARI. On receipt of such order, the Director General, BARI by giving cogent reasons vide its letter dated 26.4.2005 (Annexure-P) requested the Secretary, Ministry of agriculture, to withdraw the cancellation order (Annexure-O) stating that as the petitioner is working in BARI and for public interest, his transfer on deputation has been cancelled, but without any result. Then BARI as per order dated 24.4.2005 of the Ministry also cancelled the jointing report of the petitioner vide order dated 12.7.2005.<br/> <br/>By this time the Ministry of Agriculture appointed Mr. Syed Nakib Muslim, Joint Secretary (extension) of the same Ministry as inquiry officer, vide Memo No.<strong> কৃম-৩/চাকুরী (নিয়োগ) ৩৭ (বারি) ২০০৩/২৭৯ </strong>dated 05.05.2005 to make an inquiry about the matter of joining of the petitioner to BARI in the post of Senior Assistant Director (Administration). The inquiry officer, upon inquiry, submitted his report dated 19.5.2005:<br/>“ ----- সিদ্ধান্ত যেহেতু, জনাব ইসলাম শেরে বাংলা কৃষি বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে সরাসরি নিয়োকৃত বা পদোন্নতি প্রাপ্ত কোন অফিসার নন এবং যেহেতু, বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের বিধানানুযায়ী ডেপুটি রেজিস্ট্রার হিসাবে কাজ করার কোন চুক্তিনামা স্বাক্ষর করেননি এবং তিনি এখনও বাংলাদেশ কৃষি গবেষনা ইনস্টিটিউট (বারি) এর অফিসার এবং তাঁর চাকুরী বারির প্রবিধানমালা অনুযায়ী নিয়োগপ্রাপ্ত  এবং এই কারণে জানব ইসলাম তার মূল দপ্তরে প্রত্যাবর্তনের অধিকরার সংরক্ষণ করেন এবং বাংলাদেশ কৃষি গবেষনা ইনস্টিটিউট (বারি) এর বর্তমান বাংলাদেশ কৃষি গবেষনা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় কর্তৃপক্ষ কর্তৃক অগ্রায়িত আবেদনের পরিপ্রেক্ষিতে মহাপরিচলক, বাংলাদেশ কৃষি গবেষণা ইনষ্টিটিউট (বারি) তার প্রেষণের যে আদেশ বাতিল করেছেন তা যুক্তিসম্মত বলে প্রতীয়মান হচ্ছে।<br/>অতএব, বাংলাদেশ কৃষি গবেষণা ইনস্টিটিউট (বারি) এর সিনিয়র সহকারী পরিচালক (প্রশাসন) পদে কাজী মোঃ সাদেকুল ইসলাম এর ১৭-০৩-২০০৫ খ্রিঃ তারিখের যোগদানের বিষয়ে বাংলাদেশ কৃষি গবেষনা ইনস্টিটিউট (বারি) কর্তৃক গ্রহীত কার্যত্র্রম বিধিসম্মত।”<br/> <br/>In the backdrop of the above facts and circumstances the petitioner filed Writ Petition No. 5063 of 2005 challenging the Memo dated 24.04.2005 (Annexure-O) issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Memos date 12.07.2005 issued by the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) Annexures (S1) and (S2) cancelling the joining report of the petitioner and the Memo issued by the BARI giving current charge of the petitioner’s post to another officer Md. Mostafizur Rahman. After preliminary hearing of the Writ Petition the High Court Division issued Rule on 17.07.2005 and pending hearing of the Rule the operation of the impugned order was stayed till disposal of the Rule and respondents were directed to continue to pay the salary to the petitioner.<br/> <br/>Against the order of stay granted at the time of issuance of the Rule dated 17.07.2005, passed by the High Court Division the respondent Nos. 3, 4 and 5 filed Civil Petition for leave to Appeal No. 941 of 2005 with an application for stay of the said order dated 17.07.2005 before this Division. This Division accordingly fixed the matter for hearing.<br/> <br/>While the position was such, the petitioner again came to know that the BARI authority already prepared working paper to promote Mr. Md. Mostafizur Rahman Assistant Director (Common Service) in the post of Senior Assistant Director (Administration) who had been holding the said post by current charge. In this regard BARI invited a Departmental Promotion Committee (D.P.C.) meeting to be held within short time. In such situation, the petitioner on prayer obtained an order of injunction vide order dated 27.10.05 in this writ petition, restraining the respondents from filling up the post of Senior Assistant Director, (Admin) till disposal of the Rule. But on prayer of the respondents in CPLA No. 941/05, this Division (in chamber) stayed the operation of the order of injunction dated 27.10.2005. Pending the Rule issued earlier on 17.7.2005 and the Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 941/05 the respondent has given promotion in the post of the petitioner vide memo dated 05.06.2006 with effect from 23.02.2006 to one Md. Mustafizur Rahman, who is the added respondent No. 7 in the Writ Petition.<br/> <br/>In the aforesaid development and action taken by the respondents the petitioner made a prayer for issuance of further Rule regarding the promotion of said Md. Mustafizur Rahman to the post of the petitioner and the High Court Division issued further Rule on 25.01.2007 which run follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Let a Rule Nisi issue calling upon the respondents to show case as to why the promotion of Md. Mustafizur Rahman, as approved by 28<sup>th</sup> Board Meeting of Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute held on 06.04.2006 and communicated by Memo No. <strong>১প ২/২০০৪/ প্রশাসন/ অংশ ৩/১২৩৭৮ তারিখ ০৫/০৬/২০০৬</strong> referring Memo No. <strong>১২/২০০৪/প্রশাসন/৮৪৭১ তারিখ ২৩/০২/২০০৬ </strong>to the post of Senior Assistant Director (Administration) with effect from 23.02.2006 (Annexure-2-14) should not be declared to have been issued without lawful authority and is of no legal effect and or pass such other or further orders as to this Court may seem fit and proper.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The respondent Nos. 3-5 jointly and the respondent No. 6 alone filed an affidavit-in-opposition. The respective parties have also filed supplementary affidavits and an application for contempt of Court. <br/> <br/>By the impugned judgment and order, the High Court Division made the Rule absolute in part and directed the respondents to treat the petitioner as in continuous service in the same status and allow him to draw his salary and emoluments.<br/> <br/>Leave was granted to consider the following grounds:</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the writ petition was maintainable due to concealment of facts by the writ petitioner as to the filing of Title Suit No. 352 of 2000 and Title Appeal NO. 120 of 2002 challenging his transfer from BARI to Bangladesh Agricultural Institute, which is the cause of action in the writ petition.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the facts of dismissal of Title Suit as well as Title Appeal not having been mentioned in the writ petition, this amounted to concealment of material facts before the writ Court and as such the writ was liable to be dismissed.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"> Whether the writ petitioner who had been transferred from BARI to  Bangladesh Agricultural Institute, which is a unit of BARI, Regulations 16 (1) (Ja)(sic.) of the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute Service Regulations, 1990 was applicable in the case of the petitioner and as such whether his consent was necessary for his transfer to Bangladesh Agricultural Institute.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"> Whether the Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University having absorbed the writ petitioner in the service of the university by resolution on the first day and the petitioner having accepted the same without objection, he can now return to BARI. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the G.P. Fund of the writ petitioner having been transferred to the University as per request of the University, he can now claim to be an employee of BARI.  </li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the writ petitioner as Senior Assistant Director (Administration) of the University having taken rent of the premises in BARI on standard rent vide letter dated 16.05.2002 he can now claim to be an employee of BARI. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Rafiq-ul Hoq, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants made submissions in line with the grounds upon which leave was granted. He submitted that the High Court Division committed illegality in not holding that the writ petition was not maintainable due to concealment of facts regarding the earlier Title Suit and Title Appeal and also that Regulation 16 (1) (Ja) (sic.) of the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute Service Regulation, 1990 was not applicable in the case of the petitioner since he was transferred from BARI to Bangladesh Agricultural Institute.<br/> <br/>Mr. Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent No. 1 submitted that the Title Suit and Title Appeal related to a departmental proceeding brought against the writ petitioner which culminated in transfer of the writ petitioner and therefore had no connection with the matters raised in the writ petition. He further submitted that according to the BARI Service Regulation, 1990 the authority cannot issue an order for deputation without the consent of the employee and the writ petitioner applied through proper channel for cancellation of the transfer order on deputation and subsequently made several representations in this regard. He pointed out that according to the provision in Section 59 (2) (Ja) of Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University Act, 2001 the writ petitioner gave option to return to his original post of his parent department of BARI and therefore he cannot be said to have been absorbed in his post at Sher-e-Bangla  Agricultural University. He also pointed out that the University authority sent a proposal to the Director General of BARI as the writ petitioner’s appointing authority to withdraw the writ petitioner from the University after cancelling the order of deputation. The order of deputation was ultimately cancelled on 17.3.2005 and he was released by the university on the same date. He pointed out that the writ petitioner’s joining report was accepted in his original post as Senior Assistant Director (Administration) BARI. But subsequently, on 24.04.2005 the joining report was cancelled. The learned Counsel submitted that an inquiry was held into the matter of joining of the writ petitioner in his post at BARI. The report concluded that the writ petitioner reserved his right to return to his parent post and accordingly the cancellation of the order of deputation was proper. The learned Counsel further pointed out that the subsequent attempt by BARI authority to promote Mostafizur Rahman to the post of Senior Assistant Director (Administration), that is the post of the writ petitioner, was injuncted by an order of the High Court Division when a further Rule was issued on 25.01.2007. The learned Counsel submitted that in the light of facts and circumstances of the case the High Court Division rightly made the Rule absolute and that the appeal should be dismissed.<br/> <br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Counsel appearing for the parties concerned and perused the impugned judgment of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record.<br/> <br/>It appears that the writ petitioner Kazi Md. Sadequl Islam respondent No. 1 herein was appointed on 24.10.1990 as Assistant Director (Administration) of the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute, Joydebpur (BARI) and was later promoted on 15.04.1996 to the post of Senior Assistant Director (Administration). He was subsequently transferred on deputation to the Bangladesh Agricultural Institute, Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, Dhaka in a development post as Assistant Director, (senior scale) (Administration) on 02.09.1998 and released from his parent post on 10.09.1998 without his consent. It was submitted on behalf of the appellants that the matter of consent which appears in the service Rules of BARI, 1990 are not applicable in the case of the writ petitioner as he had already been transferred to Bangladesh Agricultural Institute. We find this argument untenable since the writ petitioner was appointed in the service of BARI, whose service regulation provides in Regulation 16 (3) (Kha) that the employee on deputation will have lien over his post in the institute (BARI) and at the end of his deputation he will return to the Institute. It is also provided in the proviso to regulation 16 (1) that an employee will not be required to remain on deputation without his consent. While on lien, the laws/regulations of Bangladesh Agricultural Institute will not apply to the employee. Moreover, he exercised his option on 09.8.2001, within the time stipulated in the <strong>শেরে বাংলা কৃষি বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় আইন, ২০০১</strong> to return to his original post of Senior Assistant Director (Administration) under the Revenue Budget. The service regulations of the University will not be applicable to the writ-petitioner. <br/> <br/>With regard to the submissions of learned Counsel for the appellants that the petitioner concealed material facts when filing the writ petition, we find that the Title Suit filed by the writ petitioner related to departmental proceedings brought against the writ petitioner for serious breach of office discipline, corruption and cheating activities and also for being absent from his work place without leave. That in our mind has no connection with the subsequent writ petition filed by the writ petitioner challenging the cancellation of the acceptance of his joining report which he had filed consequent upon cancellation of his deputation order.<br/> <br/>The evidence and materials on record clearly show that the writ petitioner-respondent No. 1 herein had all along challenged his order of deputation, patently keeping his lien of his parent post and repeatedly requesting for cancellation of the order of deputation. In such circumstances it cannot be said that the respo-ndent No. 1 was absorbed by the Bangladesh Agricultural Institute or the University and, therefore, not in the service of BARI. It is our view that respondent No.1 was employed by BARI and his status continued as such. He was sent to Bangladesh Agricultural Institute on deputation and served there while holding lien over his original post. The institute later became the Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University. His exercise of the option to return to his original post in accordance with the Act by which the University came into being is clear evidence of the fact that he was never absorbed as an employee of the Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University. Accordingly, we hold that the writ-petitioner retained his lien over the post of Senior Assistant Director (Administration) of the BARI. Hence, we need not discuss the other grounds of appeal raised by the appellants which relate to his service.<br/> <br/>The High Court Division has elaborately discussed the evidence and materials on record and upon proper assessment of the facts and circumstances made the Rule absolute in part declaring the impugned notices to have been passed without lawful authority and directing the respondents to treat the petitioner as in continuous service in the same status and to allow him to draw his salary and emoluments.   <br/> <br/>We do not find any illegality or infirmity in the impugned judgment of the High Court Division, accordingly, the appeal is dismissed without however any order as to costs.<br/><br/><strong>         Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

The said advertisement was published in “The Daily Observer” dated 09.09.2004, but no examination was held within the next two years. Then another similar advertisement was made under Memo No. প্রশা/সংস্থা/১ নিয়োগ-০৩/২০০৫-৬২৯ dated 26.04.2006 and this time, no examination was also held within the next two years. Finally, writ-respondent No. 4 made another advertisement vide Memo No. প্রশা/সংস্থা/১ নিয়োগ-১/২০০৮-৭১৪ dated 02.06.2008 which was published in “The Daily Jugantor” of 8<sup>th</sup> June, 2008. In the last advertisement, it was mentioned that the candidates, who already applied earlier, need not apply afresh. Writ-petitioner No. 1, Gazi Md. Shafiqul; writ-petitioner No. 2, Md. Anisuzzaman Talukder; writ-petitioner No. 3, Nurani Sultana Afrose and writ-petitioenr No. 5, Md. Abul Kalam Azad applied for the post of Food Inspector in 2004; writ-petitioner No. 4, Md. Jalal Uddin Sarder applied for the same post in 2006; writ-petitioner No. 6, Md. Ferdous Alam applied for the post of Sub-Inspector of Food in 2004 and 2006 respectively; writ-petitioner No. 7, Md. Atiqul Islam applied for the post of Assistant Sub-Inspector of Food in 2008. The respective writ-petitioner had requisite qualifications for the appointment in the respective post during submission of the respective application and all of them applied for the respective post in the quota ‘Children of the Freedom Fighters’. The writ-petitioners submitted relevant papers including the freedom fighters’ certificate of their respective father. All the writ-petitioners sat in the written tests against their respective post held on 24.4.2009 and came out successful in the tests. Accordingly, they got admit cards for their viva voce. The viva voce of the writ-petitioners took place on different dates between 11.11.2009 to 02.10.2010. According to the assumption of the writ-petitioners, they did well in the quota of children of the Freedom fighters and they were expecting to be selected for appointment and posting. After holding a so-called viva voce, writ-respondent No. 3 declared the result and subsequently gave  appointment to 965 candidates in the post of Food Inspector, Sub-Inspector of Food and Assistant Sub-Inspector of Food (Inspector =350, Sub-Inspector=196 and Assistant Sub-Inspector=419) by the order dated 22.06.2010. The Ministry of Establishment issued an order vide Memo No. 05.170.022.07. 01.020. 2010-59 dated 16.02.2010 in respect of Freedom Fighter quota. In that order, it has been mentioned that if the quota of the Freedom Fighters’ children cannot be filled up, the concerned posts would remain vacant. The whole process of the impugned appointments was questionable. There were various allegations of corruptions and unfair means against the writ-respondents in holding the examinations and declaring the results. The news of irregularities of the writ-respondents was widely reported in many national dailies. Despite that, the writ-respondents did not stop the process of appointment rather they made the impugned appointments most arbitrarily, unfairly and malafide. Age of the Government service of all the writ-petitioners except writ-petitioner No. 7 has already expired. Since the writ-petitioners successfully completed me written examinations and the viva voce, they had legitimate expectations that they would be selected for their respective post in the quota for ‘Children of Freedom Fighters’. But due to illegality, arbitrariness and ‘pick and choose policy’ of the writ-respondents in the appointment process, the writ-petitioners have been dropped out and they have no possibility of getting any Government job since their Government stipulated service age is already over. The writ-respondents did not follow the guideline of the Government vide Memo No. 05.170.022.07.01.020.2010-59 dated 16.02.2010 issued from the Ministry of Establishment in respect of the quota of the Freedom Fighters’ children and as such, the impugned appointment orders were liable to be declared to have been made without lawful authority and were of no legal effect. According to the Government guideline, the concerned post would remain vacant, if the quota for the Freedom Fighters’ children is not filled up. The impugned appointment orders do not reveal as to whether the said quota has been maintained and as such, the same were liable to be declared to have been made without lawful authority and were of no legal effect. The orders were also violative of the fundamental rights of the writ-petitioners guaranteed in articles 27, 31 and 40 of the Constitution.<br/> <br/>No affidavit-in-opposition was filed by the writ-respondents controverting the statements made in the writ petition. However, as it appears from the impugned judgment and order that at the time of hearing the Rule, the learned Deputy Attorney General appeared on behalf of the writ-respondents, but he could not make any effective submission as the High Court Division noted that <em>“the learned DAG, could not assist much as being without instruction.”</em><br/> <br/>By the impugned judgment and order, the High Court Division made the Rule absolute in the following terms:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The respondents are directed to accommodate the petitioners, seven in number, either in addition to those people already appointed or by excluding, seven person from the bottom of the list forthwith.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Mr. Rajik-Al-Jalil, learned Deputy Attorney General, appearing for the writ-respondent-petitioners submits that the writ-petitioners did not furnish any detail about the number of appointments made from the category of Freedom Fighters’ children; therefore, in the absence of such detail, the High Court Division erred in law in directing the Government to appoint them from the quota of the children of the Freedom Fighters. He submits that the High Court Division erred in law in giving the direction upon the Government to appoint the writ-petitioners inasmuch as before giving such direction, it should have ascertained whether there were vacant posts or not, and that there might be other better candidates in the category of children of the Freedom Fighters than the writ-petitioners. He further submits that the High Court Division failed to consider that it is not practically possible to cancel the appointment of persons who were previously appointed. He further submits that the High Court Division failed to consider that the appointments of Food Inspector, Sub-Inspector of Food and Assistant Sub-Inspector of Food, were made after observing all the legal formalities following 30% quota for the children of the Freedom Fighters and as such, the writ-petitioners had no cause of action to file the writ petition and the Rule was liable to be discharged for want of cause of action. He lastly submits that the writ-petition was based on disputed question of fact which could not be decided in a summary manner under the writ jurisdiction; therefore, the Rule was liable to be discharged on the ground of maintainability and as such, the impugned judgment and order calls for interference by this Court.<br/> <br/>Mr. Abdul Baset Majumder, learned Counsel, entering caveat on behalf of the writ-petitioner-respondents, has supported the impugned judgment and order.<br/> <br/>From the statements made in the writ petition as summarized hereinbefore, it appears that the whole grievance of the writ-petitioners was that they are the children of the Freedom Fighters and they applied for the appointment in the respective post of Food Inspector, Sub-Inspector of Food and Assistant Sub-Inspector of Food having requisite qualifications and they having duly qualified for the respective post both in the written and the viva voce examination, were entitled to be appointed to the respective post they applied for. The writ-respondents gave the impugned appointments without following 30% quota reserved for the children of the Freedom Fighters and in the process, the writ-petitioners were not appointed illegally and in the meantime, except writ-petitioner No.7, all other writ-petitioners crossed the age of the Government job.<br/> <br/>As already stated hereinbefore, no affidavit-in-opposition was filed by the writ-respondents controverting the assertions made in the writ petition that the writ-petitioners were the children of the Freedom Fighters, that they filed the relevant papers in support of their claim, that they were the children of Freedom Fighters and that they qualified for the respective post in both the examinations: written and viva voce and that the writ-respondents made the appointment by the impugned orders without fulfilling the 30% quota reserved for the children of the Freedom Fighters.<br/> <br/>In the leave petition, though it has been submitted that the High Court Division failed to appreciate that at the time of appointment of Food Inspector, Sub-Inspector of Food and Assistant Sub-Inspector of Food “30% (thirty percent) quota of children of Freedom Fighters was followed”, no paper or document has been filed to substantiate the said submission. When in the writ petition, the writ-petitioners categorically asserted that in giving the appointments by the orders impugned in the writ petition, 30% quota reserved for the children of the Freedom Fighters was not followed and the High Court Division found that <em>"In this case as the documents shows (sic), this policy has not been followed", </em>the leave petitioners (the writ-respondents) were under legal obligation to produce documents/papers to show that in appointing the Food Inspector, the Sub-Inspector of Food and the Assistant Sub-Inspector of Food, 30% quota of the children of the Freedom Fighters was followed, but they have not produced any such papers. Admittedly, when no affidavit-in-opposition was filed before the High Court Division denying or controverting the case of the writ-petitioners that 30% quota for the children of the Freedom Fighters was not followed, the High Court Division had no option but to accept the case of the writ-petitioners; therefore, we find no substance in the submissions of the learned Deputy Attorney General. In this regard, it may further be stated that the statements made in the writ petition that except writ-petitioner No.7, the other writ-petitioners have already crossed the age of getting the Government job, has also remained un-assailed.<br/> <br/>In view of the above, We find nothing wrong with the High Court Division in holding that “<em>As a result of the Respondents’ failure to come up with any affidavit in opposition, we have no choice but to accept as true the averments and the claims that has been laid by the petitioners. The petitioners claims (sic) that the 30% quota system has not been followed in the recruitment process. There is no doubt that there is a policy being followed by the government that in every appointment 30% quota must be kept for the freedom fighters or there (sic) off springs. In this case as the documents shows, this policy has not been followed. The impugned decision, can, hence not be termed as lawful.”  </em>Therefore, no interference is called for with the impugned judgment and order. However, considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the submissions of the learned Deputy Attorney General, we direct the writ-respondents to implement the direction of the High Court Division imme-diately, if 30% quota for the children of the Freedom Fighters has not been filled up in making the appointments in the posts of Food Inspector, Sub-Inspector of Food and Assistant Sub-Inspector of Food.<br/> <br/>We make it very clear that the writ-respondents shall not take any other excuse or plea to avoid the appointment of the writ-petitioners pursuant to the direction of the High Court Division in the respective posts they applied for in case 30% quota reserved for the children of the Freedom Fighters was not maintained in making the appointments.<br/> <br/>This petition is disposed of accordingly.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

It was extended time to time and lastly on 12.01.2014 extended for a further period of 3(three) months  from date.<br/><br/>Short facts, for the disposal of this Rule, are that the respondent no. 2 Eastern Bank Limited, Agrabad Branch, 33, Agrabad Commercial Area, Chittagong, as plaintiff, instituted Artha Rin Suit No. 61 of 2012 before the Artha Rin Adalat, Chittagong against the petitioner and others for recovery of its outstanding dues together with interest thereon of Tk. 16,11,681.89 as on 30.04.2012. The petitioner and other defendants entered appearance in the suit and contested the same by filing written statement denying the material allegations of the plaint.  At one stage of the proceeding, particularly when the suit was fixed for further hearing, the defendants including the petitioner filed an application under section 22 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 for settling the dispute by the intervention of the mediator under the supervision of the Court.  The Artha Rin Adalat, upon hearing the parties and on consideration of the materials on record, by its order dated 25.4.2013, rejected the said application for mediation holding, <em>inter alia, </em>that  without consent of both the parties mediation process would not be fruitful. Moreover, the Court was informed that the plaintiff bank expressed its unwillingness to go with the mediation process. Against the said impugned order dated 25.4.2013, the defendant no. 2 approached this Court and obtained the present Rule and order of stay as stated above.<br/><br/>Mr. Mahfuzur Rahman Roman, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the defendant-petitioner,  drawing our attention to the provision of section 22 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003, submits that  after amending the said provision of law the mediation process was made mandatory for the purpose of resolving the dispute between the parties under the supervision of the Court and as such the impugned order rejecting the application for mediation is illegal, without lawful authority and is of no legal effect.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate for the petitioner submits further that there is no option for the plaintiff-Bank to raise any objection against mediation process and the Court upon its own volition should have exercised the power and sent the matter for mediation in view of the provision of chapter 5 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003.<br/><br/>Mr. Nazmul Karim, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent no. 2 bank, frankly concedes that the mediation process in view of provision of section 22 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 is a mandatory one and we find him in a difficult position to oppose the Rule.<br/><br/>We have heard the learned Advocates from both the parties, perused the materials on record and other documents including the impugned order as placed before us.<br/><br/>On a plain reading of sub-section(1) of section 22 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003, it appears that after filing of the written statement by the defendant, the Court shall send the matter to the parties for the purpose of mediation under the supervision of the Court. Sub-section (6) of Section 22 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 provides that within 10 days from the date of sending the matter in view of the provision of Sub-section (1) of section 22 of the Ain, parties will inform the Court in writing the name of the mediator, but when the parties failed to provide the name of the mediator within the aforesaid 10 days, the Court shall appoint a mediator to resolve the dispute between the parties.<br/><br/>Having read together with the provision of sub-section(1) and sub-section (6) of section 22 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003, we find  that this provision made mediation mandatory for the purpose of dispute resolution under the supervision of the Court.<br/><br/>The legislature has incorporated these provisions of mediation or settlement conference or in other words alternative dispute resolution to mediate the dispute or to realize the outstanding dues from the defaulted borrower without unnecessary spending time, energy and money in litigations. In this respect if we look into the preamble of the Ain we will see that the whole purpose of Ain is to realize the unpaid loan given by the financial institution to the borrower for different purposes of their business. The preamble of the Ain reads as follow:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“যেহেতু আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠান কর্তৃক প্রদত্ত ঋন আদায়ের জন্য প্রচলিত আইনের অধিকতর সং­শোধন ও সংহতকরন প্রয়োজনীয়, সে­হেতু এতদ্বারা নিম্নরূপ আইন করা হইল”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>So, the legislature while incorporating the Ain has given prime consideration for realization of the unpaid loan. Since the whole purpose of enacting the law is for recovery of loan and as such the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 has been incorporated upon consolidating the law of 1990 and since under the previous law it appeared that by filing suits or execution cases money could be recovered but not in a short span of time and thus the legislature has incorporated the provision of chapter 5 in the new Ain, 2003 for easy recovery of money within a short time and as such alternative dispute resolution has been incorporated in the new Ain for the purpose of realizing money without spending much time and money in litigations.<br/><br/>As such chapter 5 has been incorporated in the present Ain, 2003 allowing the parties to ask for amicable settlement under section 22 of the Ain, 2003 and lastly by Act No. 16 of 2010 this mediation process has been amended and make it mandatory for the parties of the suit to go for mediation at a certain stage of the proceeding to decide the dispute between the parties at the intervention of the mediator.<br/><br/>Adalat is under a statutory obligation of the provision of law that it should send the pleadings to the parties of the suit or their engaged lawyer as soon as filing the written statement by the defendant without any prayer either of the parties of the suit.<br/><br/>Moreover, when the defendant borrower wants to settle the dispute with the intervention of the mediator in an alternative dispute resolution, in such a situation the plaintiff-Bank should have extended its hand to materialize the intention of the legislature and also for early recovery of its dues from the defaulted borrower without spending much time or money in litigation.<br/><br/>Be that as it may we find that the parties of the suit have many options, if they want to settle the dispute in an alternative manner. It is necessary to mention here that in all purposes of mediation or settlement conference or alternative dispute resolution (ADR) Adalat should have taken a vital role to materialize the dispute of the contending parties out of court without expending time and energy unnecessarily.<br/><br/>For the reasons and discussions made herein above and also the relevant law, we are of the view that the Rule has merit and thus the Rule is made absolute, however without any order as to costs. The order dated 25.04.2013 passed by the Artha Rin Adalat, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Chittagong in Artha Rin Suit No. 61 of  2012 is hereby declared illegal and is of no legal effect.<br/><br/>The Adalat concerned is hereby directed to appoint a mediator for holding mediation within 15 (fifteen) working days of receipt of this judgment. In doing so, the parties of the suit are also directed to take positive steps for holding mediation keeping in view of the provision of subsection (5) of section 22 of the Ain, 2003. The concerned Artha Rin Adalat is also directed to proceed with the suit in accordance with law, if the parties of the suit failed to mediate the dispute within 90 (Ninety) days, from the date of appointment of mediator by the Adalat, as provided under section 22(5) of the Ain, 2003.<br/><br/>Send copy of this judgment to the 1<sup>st</sup> Court of Artha Rin Adalat, Chittagong at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Nazrul Islam is directed against the judgment and order dated 03.12.2007 passed by the High Court Division in Death Reference No. 27 of 2003, which was heard along with Criminal Appeal No.786 of 2003 and Jail Appeal No.191 of 2003 accepting the reference, dismissing the criminal appeal and jail appeal.<br/> <br/>The prosecution case, in brief, is that Milon Akhter (deceased), younger sister of the informant was given in marriage to condemned prisoner Md. Nazrul Islam (henceforth referred to as “the accused”), 6 years back. After 6 months of the solemnization of marriage, the accused went to Saudi Arabia to work and stayed there for 2 years. Thereafter, he returned home and the couple was blessed with a son, named Nazmul Islam aged about 4 years at the time of the occurrence. The accused used to beat his wife now and then on the ground that his wife used to lead an immoral life and she was a woman of questionable character. Milon Akhter (deceased) used to live in the same mess with her husband, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, elder brother-in-law and son. The informant used to live on the same plot adjacent to the dwelling house of her sister Milon Akhter (deceased). On 12.04.2002 at 00.15 a.m., the accused started beating his wife in the northern room of their east faced half-brick-built house. At that time, his wife raised alarm and Tajul Islam, brother-in-law (fvmyi) of the deceased, Afia Khatun, mother-in-law and other people went there, but the accused bolted the door from inside and tied up the hands and legs of his wife and dealt boti dao blows on her face, chest, wrist, left thigh, abdomen and on her arms causing severe bleeding injuries and killed her by cutting her throat. Nazma Rahman (the informant)(P.W.1), Md. Tajul Islam (P.W.2), Abdul Jalil (P.W.7), Md. Babul Mia (P.W.5) and others saw the occurrence through the glass window. They informed the matter to Uttara Police Station and accordingly police came to the place of occurrence. The accused opened the door and police arrested him from the room. He made an extra-judicial confession before the public that he killed his wife. Police also recovered the blood stained boti dao from the place of occurrence. The informant lodged the First Information Report (F.I.R.) on 12.04.2002 before the Officer-in-Charge of Uttara Police Station, D.M.P., Dhaka against the accused under section 302 of the Penal Code. Accordingly, Uttara P.S. Case No.25 dated 12.04.2002 corresponding to G.R. No. 725/2002 was started.      <br/> <br/>The Investigating Officer took up the case for investigation. He visited the place of occurrence, prepared the sketch map with separate index, prepared inquest report, examined the witnesses and recorded their statements under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. After completion of investigation he submitted Charge-sheet No.145 dated 16.06.2002 under section 302 of the Penal Code against the accused.<br/> <br/>The case was ultimately transferred to the Court of Bicharok, Druto Bichar Tribunal No.4, Dhaka where it was numbered as Druto Bichar Tribunal Case No.2 of 2003.<br/>         Charge was framed under section 302 of the Penal Code against the accused and read over and explained to him, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. During trial the prosecution examined as many as 9 (nine) P.Ws. who were cross-examined by the defence, but the defence did not examine any witness.<br/> <br/>The defence case, as it transpires from the trend of cross-examination was that the accused was innocent. The informant, who was the step-sister of the deceased, had illicit connection with the accused, who used to send money to her from Saudi Arabia, and with the help of hired people she had the victim killed with an ulterior motive to grab the money.<br/> <br/>After close of recording of evidence, the accused was examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He repeated his innocence.<br/> <br/>The Bicharok of the Druto Bichar Tribunal, Dhaka after hearing the parties and upon consideration of the evidence and materials on record convicted the accused under section 302 of the Penal Code and sentenced him to death by his judgment and order dated 19.03.2003.<br/><br/>Reference under section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was made to the High Court Division for confirmation of the sentence of death, which was numbered as Death Reference No.27 of 2003.<br/><br/>Before the High Court Division the Criminal Appeal No.786 of 2003 with Jail Appeal No.191 of 2003 were preferred by the condemned petitioner, which were heard along with the death reference. By the impugned judgment and order, the High Court Division accepted the reference and dismissed the criminal appeal with jail appeal and confirmed the judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed by the Bicharok of the Druto Bichar Tribunal No.4, Dhaka. Hence, the condemned prisoner has filed the instant Jail Petition No.17 of 2010 before this Division.<br/><br/>Mr. Helaluddin Mollah, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that admittedly the victim was the petitioner’s wife who met her death inside his house. But no one saw the accused inflicting the injuries upon the victim which resulted in her death. He further submits that according to the evidence of the witnesses the petitioner after returning from abroad had argument with his sister-in-law, the informant, regarding money which he had remitted from abroad and he was occasionally abnormal. He also pointed out that the condemned petitioner has been in the condemned cell since 19.03.2003 for about 9 years suffering the pangs of death while his appeal and death reference was pending before the High Court Division. He finally submits that the petitioner has a child who was aged four years at the time. He prays that in view of the extenuating circumstances, this Division will have mercy and commute the sentence of death. <br/><br/>Mr. Md. Shahrowardi, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing on behalf of the State submits that the occurrence took place inside the bedroom of the petitioner where he brutally killed the victim who was his wife. He further submits that in the facts and circums-tances of the case, the petitioner was rightly sentenced to death by the trial Court and the reference was accepted by the High Court Division and he does not deserve any leniency from this Division.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates for the parties concerned and perused the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record.   <br/>    <br/>It is in evidence that the victim was killed by the accused inside her bedroom and, according to the evidence of the mother and brother of the accused, the door of the room was locked from inside. The door was also found locked from the outside to prevent his escape before arrival of the police. The police arrested the condemned petitioner from the place near the victim’s dead body. The police also seized the blood stained dao which the condemned petitioner had used to kill his wife. According to the post mortem report and the evidence of P.W.9 the Doctor, there were as many as eight ‘chop wounds’ found on various parts of the body of the victim. In the opinion of the Doctor, the death was due to haem-orrhage and shock following injuries to the neck and different parts of the body with the heavy sharp cutting weapon. The occurrence was corroborated by the evidence of the mother and brother of the condemned petitioner as well as other independent witnesses. In view of such evidence the conviction under section 302 of the Penal Code as found by the trial Court and affirmed by the High Court Division, cannot be faulted.<br/><br/>With regard to the sentence of death awarded by the trial Court and confirmed by the High Court Division, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner begs mercy of this Court and prays for commutation of the sentence of death.<br/><br/>In reaching its decision, the High Court Division relied upon a number of decisions of this Division as well as the decision of the High Court Division in the case of State Vs. Kalu Bepari. In each of the cases referred the victim was the wife of the accused. The pertinent question in those cases was whether it was established by evidence that the accused person was in his house where his wife was murdered, failing which he could not be saddled with any onus to prove his innocence. If it could be established by evidence that the accused was in his house at the material time then the Court would consider his failure to adduce explanation or the falsity of his explanation along with other incriminating circumstances. The High Court Division relied upon the cases of State Vs. Kalu Bepari reported in 43 DLR 249; Abdul Motleb Howlader Vs. The State, 5 MLR(AD)362; Ilias Hussain (Md) Vs. The State, 54 DLR (AD)78 and Shamsuddin Vs. The State, 45 DLR 587 which in turn relied upon State Vs. Kalu Bepari (cited above) and held that the accused (petitioner before us) was responsible for causing the death of his wife.<br/><br/>The High Court Division then considered the circumstances in which the condemned petitioner killed his wife taking into account the fact that “the accused inflicted multiple sharp chop injuries on various parts of the body of the deceased. Before chopping, the accused tied up the hands and legs of his wife with clothes. Thereafter, he dealt boti blows and slaughtered his wife. All these circumstances proved that the accused had all the intention to kill his wife”. This led the High Court Division to the conclusion that the act of the accused falls within the mischief of murder as provided under section 300 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>At the appeal hearing before the High Court Division the learned Advocate for the accused-appellant pleaded that the accused had been languishing in the condemned cell for 4 years and 9 months which was not accepted by that Division as a ground for commuting the sentence of death. In this regard the High Court Division relied upon the decision in the case of Abed Ali Vs. The State reported in 42 DLR (AD) 171 where their Lordships referred to the case of Nowsher Ali Vs. State, 39 DLR 57, wherein it was held that “the delay in execution of death sentence for want of confirmation cannot by itself constitute mitigating circums-tance but abnormal and excessive delay of 6 years may be considered for commutation of death to life imprisonment”. However, in the facts presented in Abed Ali’s case their Lordships felt obliged to sustain the order of conviction and sentence. <br/><br/>It is noteworthy that the High Court Division also referred to the decision in the case of Abdul Bashir alias Bashu Vs. The State reported in 56 DLR (AD)207 and the case of Giasuddin and another Vs. The State reported in 54 DLR (AD)(2002)146 where the delay was not accepted as a ground for commutation of sentence. <br/><br/>In the latter case this Division observed that “these two condemned prisoners committed a cold-blooded murder in broad daylight and the materials on record clearly proved that they hatched a plan to commit murder and with that intention they were following the movements of the deceased … … their act of commission of murder was premeditated, cold-blooded and so brutal that they deserve no mercy and justice demands adequate and proper punishment which has been awarded”.<br/><br/>In the instant case the High Court Division observed that before the victim was done to death, the husband tied up her hands and legs with clothes and killed her by inflicting indiscriminate blows by boti dao. He closed the door of the room from inside so that others could not come to her rescue. Hence, the High Court Division found that the accused deserved no sympathy from the Court.<br/><br/>The facts of the instant case disclose a number of mitigating aspects which have come to light:(i) the first and foremost is the fact that there is a child of the accused who was four years old at the time of occurrence in 2002; (ii) The age of the accused who was twenty seven years old at the time of occurrence; (iii) the fact that the mental state of the accused had been affected due to squandering of his hard earned money by family members, principally his sister-in-law who was the victim’s step sister; and (iv) the length of time the accused has spent in the condemned cell since the date of judgment of the trial Court on 19 March 2003, amounting to 9years.<br/><br/>With regard to the first mitigating circumstance mentioned above, reference may be made to the judgement delivered by B.B. Roy Chowdhury, J. when his Lordship was presiding a High Court Division Bench, where the existence of wife and children swayed their Lordships to commute the sentence of death to one of imprisonment for life. In similar fashion in the case of Ananta Kumar Karan Vs. the State reported in AIR 1962 Calcutta 428, their Lordships noted that large number of incised injuries were inflicted on the deceased by a sword and the accused absconded for a number of years; their Lordships observed that although the assault was brutal in nature, the fact remains that the prosecution did not prove the motive for the assault and killing. The sentence of death was commuted to imprisonment for life on account of the age of the appellant and the fact that he had a wife and a number of children living which in their Lordships’ view constituted an extenuation of the offence which at first struck them as brutal beyond word.<br/><br/>I have already referred to the age of the accused being a ground for commutation of sentence while mentioning the case of State Vs. Tasiruddin reported in 13 DLR 203 which was referred by this Division in the case of Jail Petition No.15 of 2010. From the cases referred in the Tasiruddin case it can be seen that age of the offender upto 27 years has been considered as a ground for commutation of the sentence of death.<br/><br/>The aspect of the mental state of the accused as disclosed by the evidence of P.Ws. 2 and 3 coupled with the fact that no motive for the murder was disclosed by the prosecution, can be taken as an extenuating fact for reducing the sentence, as was done in the Ananta Kumar Karan case mentioned above.<br/><br/>Lastly, with regard to the period of time spent by the accused in the condemned cell, there are numerous decisions of this Division which shed light on this aspect. In general terms, it may be stated that the length of period spent by a convict in the condemned cell is not necessarily a ground for commutation of the sentence of death. However, where the period spent in the condemned cell is not due to any fault of the convict and where the period spent there is inordinately long, it may be considered as an extenuating ground sufficient for commutation of sentence of death. It is noted that the High Court Division in rejecting this plea referred to the case of Abed Ali Vs. the State, cited above. In that case this Division held that delay in execution cannot by itself constitute a mitigating circumstance, but mention was made of the Nowsher Ali case (cited above) where it was observed that <u>a delay of six years may be considered for commutation of death sentence to life imprisonment</u> (emphasis added). In the instant case, when the matter was heard by the High Court Division the convict had been in the condemned cell for less than five years, and hence the plea was rejected. However, the convict has now been in the condemned cell for more than 9 years due to no fault of his own. Thus the length of period by now can be taken as a circumstance, when there are other extenuating circumstances, to commute the sentence of death to one of imprisonment for life.<br/><br/>Considering the above facts and circum-stances, we are of the view that the judgment of the High Court Division be upheld so far as it relates to conviction of the accused under section 302 of the Penal Code. The Jail Petition is therefore dismissed. However, in the light of the discussion regarding sentence, we are of the view that, in the facts and circumstances of the case, justice will be sufficiently met if the sentence of death is commuted to one of imprisonment for life. Accordingly, the sentence of the convict Md. Nazrul Islam is modified to imprisonment for life.<br/><br/><strong>         Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

J. Mohammad Ali, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner in the course of his argument upon placing the plaint of the suit submits that it is apparent from the plaint the plaintiff filed the suit  challenging the Memo No. 7/2N-92/85/1135 dated 12.10.2004 issued by the Senior Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs by which the concerned authority of the Government appointed the defendant petitioner as Nikah Registrar of No.8, Maria Union in curtailing   the power of plaintiff opposite party as he continued to remain as Nikah Registrar for two Unions which is inconformity with the Rule 10 of Rules, 1975 as amended on 2<sup>nd</sup> October, 2002. The learned Counsel further submits that the learned Additional District Judge erred in law in setting-aside the well founded judgment of the trial Court without properly considering the facts of the case and the case made out by the petitioner and the same has occasioned failure of justice.<br/><br/>Mr. Mohammad  Nurul Haque, the learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff-opposite party, on the other hand, supports the impugned judgment and decree which was according to him just, correct and proper. He submits that the Court of appeal below was perfectly justified in setting-aside the judgment and decree of the trial Court on the clear finding that neither the defendant nor the trial Court mentioned under what law the suit is barred. Finally, the learned Advocate submits that the proposition of law is by now well settled that  in deciding an application under section 7, Rule 11(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure the Court cannot travel  beyond the averments of the plaint and the plea of implied bar raised in the application for rejection the plaint is mixed question of law and fact, which can be decided only at the trial on taking evidence.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Abdul Hai, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the opposite party No.4, Secretary, Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs submits that under section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure  all suits of civil nature lie in Civil Court unless  the same is impliedly barred by specific provision of law, the issues involved in the present suit are clearly and plainly barred by the provisions  of Rule 10 of Rules 1975 as amended on 2.10. 2002 . Finally, the learned Deputy Attorney General submits in any event this is not a case in which the ordinary Civil Court has jurisdiction to grant the relief asked for by the plaintiff opposite party No. 1.<br/><br/>I have heard the learned Advocates for both the sides as well as the learned Deputy Attorney General and perused the revision application, judgments of two Courts below together with the connected laws. The only material question for consideration in this case is, whether the Court of appeal below has committed any illegality  in holding that the suit is not barred by any law.<br/><br/>It appears that in the present case the plaintiff-opposite party No.1 continued to remain as Nikah Registrar  for 2(two) unions, that is,  Maria Union and Binnati Union under Kishoregonj District.<br/><br/>In exercise of the power under section 14 of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Act, 1974, Rules, 1975 was promulgated. Rule 10 speaks an area in which a Nikah Registrar may be licensed to exercise his jurisdiction. Rule 10 was amended on 19.1.93 and thereafter it was further amended on 30.12.97 by specifying the area within which a Nikah Registrar may be appointed and thereafter further it was amended on 2<sup>nd</sup> October, 2002  as published in Official Gazette on 3.10.2002.

The impugned Memo No. 7/2N-92/85/1135 dated 12.10.2004  reads as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><u>বিষয়ঃ- কিশোরগঞ্জ জেলার সদর উপজেলার ৮ নং মারিয়া ইউনিয়নে নিকাহ রেজিষ্ট্রার নিয়োগ প্রসংগে</u><br/><br/>উপরে উল্লেখিত বিষয়ের নিম্ন সাক্ষরকারী আদিষ্ট হইয়া জানাইতেছি যে, সরকার ১৯৭৪ সনের মুসলিম বিবাহ ও তালাক (রেজিষ্ট্রীকরণ) আইনের ৪ ধারা এবং ১৯৭৫ সনের মুসলিম বিবাহ ও তালাক (রেজিষ্ট্রীকরণ বিধিমালার ৫(১) বিধির প্রদত্ত ক্ষমতা বলে জনাব এ, কে, ফজলুল হক, নিকাহ রেজিষ্ট্রর এর এলাকা হইতে ৮ নং মারিয়া ইউনিয়নটি কর্তন পুর্বক নতুন অধিক্ষেত্র সৃষ্টি করতঃ জনস্বার্থে জনাব মোঃ সাইফুল ইসলাম, পিতা - মৃত নুরুল হক, সাং মোল্লাপাড়া, পোঃ + উপজেলা + জেলা-কিশোরগঞ্জ-কে ৮ নং মারিয়া ইউনিয়নের অস্থায়ী নিকাহ রেজিষ্ট্রার নিয়োগের অনুমোদন প্রদান করিলেন।<br/><br/>২। এই বিষয়ে প্রয়োজনীয় ব্যবস্থা গ্রহন ও বিধি মোতাবেক দরখাস্ত আহবান পূর্বক স্থায়ী নিয়োগের প্যানেল প্রেরনের জন্য অনুরোধ করা হইল।<br/><br/>৩। অত্র আদেশ কোন মামলায় কোনরুপ নিষেধাজ্ঞা বা স্থগিতাদেশ থাকিলে কার্যকর হইবে না।</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;"><br/>স্বা/<br/>(এ,এইচ, এম, সামসুল আরেফিন)<br/>সিনিয়র সহকারী সচিব<br/>তাং- ১২/১০/২০০৪</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From the above together with the amended provision of section 10 of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Act, I am led to hold that the defendant-opposite party No.2 committed no wrong in  curtailing the Nikah Registrar ship of the plaintiff-opposite party No.1 inasmuch as the plaintiff-opposite party No.1 was continuing as Nikah Registrar  for 2 (two)  unions, that is,  Maria Union and Binnati Union under Kishoregonj District which is in conformity with the Rule 10 of Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Act as amended on 2.10.2002<br/><br/>I do not think therefore that the learned Additional District Judge made a correct approach to the simple problem.<br/><br/>In view of this, I am led to hold the instant suit filed by the plaintiff challenging the order dated 12.10.2004 issued under Memo No.7/2N-92/85/1135 by the defendant No.1 by which the concerned authority of the Government appointed the defendant petitioner as Nikah Registrar of No.8 Maria Union in curtailing   the power of plaintiff opposite party is clearly barred by  the provisions of Rule 10 of Rules, 1975 as amended on 2.10. 2002.<br/><br/>The learned Senior Assistant Judge on the facts of the case and on consideration of the legal position rightly rejected the plaint by his judgment and decree dated  29.9.2005  on assigning sound  reason.<br/><br/>For the foregoing reasons stated above, both on law and fact,  I hold that the judgment and decree of the appellate Court below is liable to be set aside and that of the trial Court be restored.  Consequently, the Rule is made absolute without any order as to costs.

Kaium (P.W. 10) was taking his bath in the canal in front of their house accused Mahibullah, as a sequel to previous enmity, started beating him with a lathi. Kaium’s younger sister Rekha alias Rina raised hue and cry, hearing which Abdus Sattar (the victim) and Kohinoor, Kaium’s father and mother respectively came to the place of occur-rence. Afzal Hossain, father of Mahibullah also came to the place of occurrence and caught hold of Abdus Sattar’s throat and Mahibullah dealt several lathi blows on Abdus Sattar, who then became senseless and fell to the ground. The victim succumbed to his injuries. On the following day the victim’s son-in-law, Bazlur Rahman lodged a First Information Report (F.I.R.) with Nasarabad Police Station thus giving rise to Nasarabad PS Case No. 11 dated 16/10/1995.<br/><br/>After investigation, police submitted charge sheet No. 69 dated 12/12/1995 against accused Afzal Hossain and Mahibullah under sections 323/302/34 of the Penal Code. The case was transferred to the court of Sessions Judge, Pirojpur and numbered as Sessions Case No. 53 of 1996. Charge was framed against the accused under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code. In addition Mahibullah was charged under section 323 of the Penal Code. The charge was read over to the accused, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/><br/>The prosecution examined 18 witnesses, of whom PWs 1-6, 8 and 9 were declared hostile. The defence did not examine any witness. When the accused were examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, they again pleaded their innocence.<br/><br/>The learned Sessions Judge on consider-ation of the evidence and materials on record convicted both the accused under the first part of section 304 of the Penal Code and sentenced them to suffer rigourous imprisonment for 10 years and to pay fine of Tk.2,000/-each, in default to suffer rigourous imprisonment for two months more. In addition accused Mahibullah was convicted under section 323 of the Penal Code and sentenced to suffer rigourous imprisonment for three months, his sentences of imprisonment to run concurrently.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgement and order of conviction and sentence, the accused preferred Criminal Appeal No. 1062 of 1997 before the High Court Division. By the impugned judgement and order the High Court Division dismissed the appeal and hence the appellants filed Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 809 of 2012. Leave was granted to consider the following grounds:</div><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the trial court as well as the High Court Division failed to consider that the sentence had been awarded on the basis of contradictory statements of the prosecution witnesses and the prosecution failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt and as such the impugned judgement and order passed by the High Court Division is liable to be set aside;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the ingredients of the charges having not been proved by any independent witness, the judgement of the High Court Division concurring with the findings of the Sessions Judge and maintaining the sentence awarded to the petitioners, is liable to be set aside;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the High Court Division did not assess the evidence of the witnesses in proper perspective keeping in mind that there was no independent witness and hence the judgement of the High Court Division is liable to be set aside.</li></ul><div style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Yusouf Hossain Humayun, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants submitted in support of the grounds upon which leave was granted. He reiterated that there were no independent witnesses supporting the occurrence and those witnesses other than the family members of the victim, who came to depose did not support the prosecution case. He further submitted that appellant No. 1 is an old man and is not likely to have engaged in the quarrel which allegedly took place between Kaium and Mahibullah. Finally, he submitted that the alleged occurrence took place over a fight between two youngsters and hence the sentence, in the facts and circumstances of the case as alleged by the prosecution is too harsh.<br/><br/>Mr. Biswajit Deb Nath, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing on behalf of the State-respondent submitted that the post-mortem examination report clearly indicates that the victim died of shock and haemorrhage caused by injuries which were ante mortem and homicidal in nature. He pointed out that there were no less than eight injuries found on the body of the victim, including on vital parts of his body, such as the head and neck. He submitted that presence of such injuries clearly indicates that the witnesses who deposed that the victim died of some other cause, were telling lies. He further submitted that the wife of victim Abdus Sattar, his son Kaium and his daughter Rekha were natural witnesses to the occurrence. Moreover,  Kohinoor and Kaium were both themselves victims, having received injuries on their person which has been supported by medical evidence. He pointed out that the altercation which took place between Kaium and Mahibullah was not denied even by those witnesses who were declared hostile by the prosecution. That occurrence was a precursor to the later occurrence which led to the death of victim Abdus Sattar. He finally submitted that clearly the victim died of the injuries caused by Mahibullah since the doctor, PW 17 stated in his cross-examination that the death was not caused due to asphyxia on account of strangulation.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned advocates appearing for the parties concerned and perused the impugned judgement as well as other evidence and materials on record.<br/><br/>At the outset, it appears to us that the occurrence took place over a trifling altercation between two youths and developed into a family brawl where the parents also became involved. Accused Mahibullah, according to the age stated in his examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was about 18 years old at the time of the occurrence. Kaium was about 20 years old. It is a common phenomenon, particularly in rural Bangladesh for trifling matters to develop into incidents involving fatality. According to the evidence of PW 16, Rekha alias Rena, who was at the scene of occurrence from the very beginning, Mahibullah started beating her brother Kaium as soon as he reached the bank of the canal after taking his bath. Upon hearing hue and cry her father and mother came to the scene of occurrence. Mahibullah’s father Afzal Hossain also came to the scene of occurrence and caught hold of her father’s (the victim’s) throat. Her father fell to the ground and Mahibullah beat him with lathi. Thus we get a vivid picture of the whole scenario from the 12-year-old girl whom the learned judge found on questioning to be a competent witness. Taking all the factors into consideration the learned Sessions Judge came to the conclusion that the beating by the accused persons caused the death of the victim, but the way they beat him, it is clear that they had no intention to cause murder. The learned judge was satisfied that the beating was such that they intended to cause injury which could cause his death.<br/> <br/>If the assailant intended to cause injury which could cause the victim’s death, then he would fall foul of the definition of culpable homicide and murder in section 299 read with section 300 of the Penal Code. Section 304 of the Penal Code can only apply if the culpable homicide falls within one of the exceptions under section 300. The learned Sessions Judge did not specify which exception he found to be applicable in the facts of the case before him.<br/><br/>On meticulous assessment of the evidence on record, we find that the injury inflicted by Mahibullah was the cause of death of the victim. In particular we note that the injury on the head was a blow to a vital part of the victim’s body which caused internal blood clotting. There were also injuries on the back of the neck and sides of the neck which caused haematoma with extravasated clotted blood found under the injuries.<br/>However, all these must be considered in the context in which the beating took place. Mahibullah was a youngster, who had been in a quarrel with Kaium. He was already in a fighting mood when Abdus Sattar intercepted. Evidently the hot-blooded youngman carried on the beating which started with Kaium. This was the continuation of a fight and it can be said that there was no premeditation. Hence, the exception No. 4 to section 300 is applicable. Accordingly, the conviction and sentence under the first part of section 304 is the correct application of law.<br/><br/>The injury caused by Afzal Hossain was not the cause of death as found by PW 16. However, holding the throat of the victim caused him to fall to the ground and thereafter Mahibullah struck the victim with lathi. Clearly, Afzal Hossain aided and abetted Mahibullah to commit the offence which is culpable homicide not amounting to murder.<br/><br/>In the above facts and circumstances, we are of the view that the ends of justice will be sufficiently met if the sentence of Afzal Hossain is reduced to the period already undergone by him in prison.<br/><br/>In the result the appeal is dismissed. The conviction and sentence of appellant Mahibullah under the first part of Section 304 of the Penal Code is upheld. However, Afzal Hossain is found guilty under Section 304/109 of the Penal Code. He has served in prison for more than 2 years. The sentence of appellant No. 1, Afzal Hossain is reduced to the period undergone by him in prison and accordingly he is directed to be released forthwith unless he is wanted in connection with any other case.<br/><br/><strong>         Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Hamid went to the Katwali Police Station Dinajpur and lodged an Ejahar to the effect that on 12.3.1996 she along with her younger sister Aseda Begum and maternal cousin Tahera watched Matinee Cinema show at local Chourangi Cinema Hall at 3.00 PM. Cinema show over, they started for home by a rickshaw.  At about 8.00 PM they reached a place named Baterhat and by leaving the rickshaw proceeded for home on foot. When they reached a place named Kushumbi accused Najrul Islam came across them with a torch in his hand and expressed to the informant, “ I shall marry you, come with me.” When the informant refused to go with him, he forcibly pushed cloth inside her mouth and proceeded towards Khanpur village. At that time one Anisur Rahman of village Chak Gopal appeared before them. The accused threatened him. Aseda Begum and Tahera Begum went away with Anisur Rahman. The accused petitioner then dragged her at the forest of Khanpur Zagirpara at 11.00 PM and raped her forcibly there. Informant was then taken at the house of one Matin of Khanpur village at 2.00 am, where she stayed at night. On the following day i.e. on 13.03.1996 (Thursday) the accused petitioner came to her in the evening and proceeded with her to his house. At about 8.00 at night he asked her to wait in front of a person’s house at Khanpur and he entered into that house. Taking advantage of his absence she fled away from the clutch of the accused-petitioner and after returning home narrated the occurrence to her parents. On the basis of the said information recorded by the O.C, Dinajpur, Kotwali Police Station case No. 23(3) 1996 (G.R. Case No. 419 of 1996) was started against the accused petitioner for the offence punishable under section 376 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>The Police after investigation into the case submitted charge sheet against the accused petitioner under Section 9(Ga) of the Nari and Shishu Nirjatan (Bishes Bidhan) Ain 1995. The learned Judge, Special Court as well as the Session Judge, Dinajpur was pleased to take cognizance of the offence under Section 9(Ga) of the said Ain on 10.09.1996. The accused petitioner being absconding necessary formality under section 20(5) of the Said Ain, 1995 were observed for his trial in absenita. The learned Special Judge framed charge against the accused –petitioner for the offence punishable under Section 6(1) of the Nari and Shishu Nirjatan (Bishes Bidhan) Ain, 1995 by his order dated 27.11.1996. The offence having provided capital punishment learned Judge appointed state defence lawyer to defend the absconding accused petitioner. The case was thereafter transmitted to the Court of Special Judge and Additional Sessions Judge (3), Dinajpur for disposal.<br/><br/>At the time of trial the prosecution examined 8 witnesses including the victim informant and of them one was tendered and prosecution witnesses Nos. 2-4 were declared hostile by the prosecution. After closure of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses there was no scope for examination of the accused petitioner under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure he being absconding from the very beginning.<br/><br/>After hearing the learned Special Public Prosecutor and the state Defence Lawyer and considering the evidences on record, the learned Special Judge and Additional Sessions Judge-3, Dinajpur was pleased to convict the accused petitioner under Section 9 (Kha) of the Nari and Shishu Nirjatan (Bishes Bidhan) Ain, 1995 and sentenced him, thereunder  to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and also to pay a fine of Taka one thousand, in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 3 months more by his judgment and order dated 18.09.1997. The petitioner after coming to know about the case on 20.10.1997 voluntarily surrendered before the Court of the Additional District Magistrate, Dinajpur on 21.10.1997 and he was taken into custody on that day.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid impugned judgment and order dated 18.9.1997 passed by the learned Special Judge and the Additional Sessions Judge-3, Dinajpur in Special Court Case No.97 of 1996 convicting the accused petitioner under Section 9(Kha) of the Nari and Shishu Nirjatan (Bishes Bidhan) Ain, 1995  and sentencing him, thereunder to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and directing  him to pay a fine of Taka 10,000/- (Ten thousand) in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 3 (Three) months more, he preferred before a Division Bench of this  Court  an application under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure and obtained the present rule.<br/><br/>No one appears before us to make submission in support of the Rule when this item has been taken up for hearing.<br/><br/>Mr. Bishmadev Chakrabortty, the learned Deputy Attorney General  appearing for the State-respondent submits that the learned Additional Sessions  Judge did not commit any wrong in passing the impugned judgment and order convicting the petitioner under Section 9 (Kha) of the Nari and Shishu Nirjatan Daman (Bishes Bhidan) Ain, 1995 and sentencing him, thereunder to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and also directing him to pay a fine of Taka 10,000/-, in default, to suffer  rigorous imprisonment for 3 months more.<br/><br/>At the trial prosecution examined 9 witnesses out of 10 witnesses and one was declared tendered.<br/>         P.W.1 Ms. Asma Khatun is the victim. In her examination-in-chief she narrated the FIR case of the prosecution in material particulars. We need not repeat the same here. She proved the FIR lodged by her as Ext. I and her signature thereon as Ext. 1/1. In cross examination she stated that she was married after to the occurrence and her husband’s name was Md. Ismail Hossain. She further stated she left with the accused petitioner for marriage with him. But when she came to know that he had wife she returned (home). He did not violate her.<br/><br/>P. W. 2 Abdul Gani was declared hostile when he stated in his examination-in-chief that the informant told him that petitioner kept her sitting in the wheat field. Nothing come out from his mouth supporting prosecution case.<br/><br/>P. W. 3 Md. Munzur Ali did not know anything about the incident as stated by him in his examination-in-chief. He was also declared hostile and cross-examined by the public prosecutor but nothing cause out from his mouth supporting prosecution case.<br/><br/>P. W. 4 Most. Momena Khatun stated that she did not know anything about the case and that she did not know the informant. The prosecution declared this witness hostile and cross examined her.  In cross P. W. 4 stated that petitioner Nazrul Islam came to her residence along with a teen aged girl and left her residence on the following day.<br/><br/>P. W. 5 Most. Rasheda Khatun stated in her examination-in-chief that she was 10 years of age. Accused Nazrul Islam took away her sister forcibly. At that time she, victim Asma, her maternal cousin Tahera were returning home by a rickshaw after cinema show. At Baterhat they left the rickshaw and were returning home on foot towards the eastern direction when accused Nazrul Islam forcibly took away the victim by gagging her mouth. They, the two, then returned home weeping and narrated the occurrence to their parents and neighbours. On the following day when accused Nazrul was taking away victim Asma to another place she returned home by playing a trick upon him and narrated the occurrence. In her cross-examination she stated that her cousin Taher was married at the time of occurrence. She denied the defence suggestion that Nazrul Islam did not take away the victim forcibly. She did not see accused Nazrul before the occurrence. After her return victim told that accused Nazrul forcibly took her away. Since then she had been knowing Nazrul. She denied to have deposed a falsehood.<br/><br/>P. W. 6 Abdul Hamid is the father of the victim Asma Khatun. He stated in his examination-in-chief that victim Asma was his daughter. On the 30<sup>th</sup> Falgun, the day being Wednesday Asma, Asheda (@Rasheda) and his niece Taher went to Dinajpur and after collecting the next date of Taher’s case, they watched a cinema show and after having meal in a hotel were returning home by a rickshaw. After reaching Baterhat, they left the rickshaw and were returning home on foot. It was dusk when they reached to the east of village Kusumleondi. Accused Nazrul Islam forcibly took Asma away to a wheat field at Khanpur and raped her forcibly. From there he took her to the house of one Motin of Khanpur. On the following day (Thursday) at night victim Asma fled away and returned home and narrated the occurrence. On the following day he took Asma to Police Station Asma then lodged the case. She was medically examined after the occurrence and Nazrul proposed to compound the case on payment of taka 10,000/- to which he did not agree. In his cross- examination he stated that on the following  day when victim Asma returned home his neighbours Momtaz and Hafiz who were present also heard about the occurrence. They were not cited witnesses in the case. He denied the defence suggestion at the of any litigation mongering people conspiracy he lodged the case or that accused Nazrul did not take her away forcibly.<br/><br/>P.W. 7 Ramzan Ali was tendered. Defence declined to cross examine him.<br/><br/>P.W. 8 Dr. Md. Golam Mostafa Resident Medical Officer who examined the victim proved Medical report of the victim as Ext. 2. The following opinion was given, “No sign of sexual assault present Ges bony age of the victim is between 14-15 years”. This witness was not cross examined by the defence.<br/><br/>P. W. 9 S. I. Moksad Ali is the investigating officer. At the relevant time he was posted as S. I. at Kotwali Police Station, Dinajpur. He deposed that S. I. Golam Mortoza recorded the FIR on the basis of statement made by the informant on 15-3-1996 and entrusted him with investigation into the case. He knew his handwriting. He proved the filled in FIR form as Ext. 3. P. W. 9 also stated that he visited the place of occurrence and prepared the sketch map and Index which he proved as Ext. 4 and 5, respectively and proved his signature thereon as  ext. 4/5 respectively. He seized alamat. He proved the seizure list as ext. 6 and his signature thereon as ext. 6/1. He recorded statements of the witnesses under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Victim Asma Khatun was examined by the Doctor. After investigation he submitted charge sheet against accused Nazrul Islam. In cross examination he stated that letter ‘Ka’ was the place of occurrence but he did not mention about the nature and particular of the place. The occurrence took place in a field.<br/><br/>On the basis of the aforesaid evidence on record learned Judge found the accused petitioner guilty of the offence under section 9(Ga) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishes Bidhan Ain) 1995.<br/><br/>It will not be out of place of mention here that though charge was framed against the accused petitioner under section 6(1) of the said Ain, 1995 for commission of rape upon the victim, the said victim Asma Khatun who deposed as PW1 did not allege commission of rape upon her. On the contrary, she stated that she left with the accused petitioner and returned home when she found that he was married and had wife. Medical examination report did not support commission of rape upon her. But consistent evidence of the PWs proved that she was forcibly taken way by the accused petitioner when she along with her younger sister PW5 Asheda and cousin (sister) Taher were returning from Dinajpur after watching a cinema show. PW5 Asheda categorically proved the same now a pertinent question is involved if there is scope to quash the impugned judgment and order of conviction.<br/><br/>It is now a well-established principle of law that quashment under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure is possible in cases of (a) facts alleged not constituting any offence (b) bar of law (c) coram nonjudice (d) lack of legal evidence adduced and for ends of justice. None of the conditions referable to (a), (b) and (c) is applicable in the present case before us. Only point that is before us for consideration is condition no (d) lack of legal evidence adduced. This court in its jurisdiction not being a court of appeal has hardly any scope to asses and appreciate evidence like a court of appeal. The witnesses who were examined were competent witnesses. There was no legal flaw in their evidence.<br/><br/>On perusal of the depositions of P.Ws. and other materials on record and on careful consideration we find that the petitioner’s case does not come within the purview of the aforesaid four conditions as laid down above. The impugned judgment and order of conviction passed by the learned tribunal does not call for any interference under the purview of section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The petitioner is not at all entitled to get any relief under the inherent jurisdiction of this Court under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/><br/>In that view of the matter we find that the learned Additional sessions Judge rightly convicted the accused Nazrul Islam and did not commit any wrong in passing the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence, thus it does not deserve any interference under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. So the petitioner is not entitled to get any relief under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/><br/>The impugned judgment and order of conviction passed by the learned Special Court and the Additional Sessions Judge, Court No. 3 Dinajpur in special case no. 97 of 1996 is hereby affirmed.<br/><br/>In the result, the Rule is discharged.<br/><br/>         Send down the lower Court records along with a copy of this judgment immediately for information and necessary action.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

All these evidences support the case of the plaintiff-respondent that there was a valid marriage between the petitioner and the respondent. . . . (11)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Hindu Law—Marriage in the Brahma Form</strong><strong>—Marriage in Asura Form—There are two ceremonies essential to the validity of a marriage whether the marriage be in the Brahma form or the Asura form. The ceremonies are (1) invocation before the sacred fire and (2) saptapadi, that is, the taking of seven steps by the bridegroom and the bride jointly before the sacred fire. In the instant case marriage was performed in fact and therefore we can safely presume that marriage is valid in law and all the necessary ceremonies have been performed. There is no evidence to the contrary to show that no marriage ceremony was solemnized according to Hindu Shastra. In the instant case the respondent proved that the ceremonies prescribed by the Shastra were performed. The defendant-petitioner as D.W.1 did not depose that no “Saptapadi” was performed before the sacred fire. Therefore, the petitioner having not raised the plea of invalidity of marriage because of non-perfor-mance of an essential rite any plea to the effect that the marriage is bad in law for want of any essential ceremony such as Saptapadi is not tenable in law. . . . (20 and 21)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Marriage under Hindu Law is treated as sacrament not a contract-But it requires some change in view of the very many problems being faced by the Hindu Community—Marriage under the traditional Hindu Law is a holy union for the performance of religious duties. It is a sacrament for the purification of the body from inherited taint. It is not a contract. Of course the marriage is necessarily the basis of social organization and the foundation of important legal rights and obligations—</strong>In view of the modern social dimensions the Hindu Community in this Country in respect of marriage, divorce and inheritance faces multifarious problems. In many cases the alleged husband does not recognize marriage or deny the existence of marriage with the female partner and the female partner also faces difficulty in respect of her right to inheritance and the issues of the marriage are also sometime disowned by the male partner to be the legitimate offspring of their wed-lock and as such, the children sometimes find difficulty to get recognition and their right of inheritance. In consequence of these varying problems being faced by the Hindu Community in this Country where the society has advanced and the women are also very much conscious about their rights  and status in respect of marriage, divorce, inheritance, we believe  time  has  come to think about the social needs and the demand of different Hindu Women right activists and other social and non-government organizations  for codification of the Hindu Law of marriage and succession. <strong>. . .

Thereafter, they lived together as husband and wife. After completion of their education from Rajshahi University both of them joined as lecturers in two different colleges. From the very beginning the petitioner demanded dowry and started to torture the plaintiff-respondent both physically and mentally as a result of which the plaintiff lodged complaint before the superintendent of police who on 15.03.1998 compromised the matter by a written agreement and again the defendant demanded dowry on 21.01.2000 and drove away the plaintiff from the house and refused to give maintenance on 20.10.2002 and hence the suit.<br/><br/>The present petitioner as defendant contested the suit by filing written statement, stating, interalia that he had not married the plaintiff-respondent and he has no relationship with her; that the plaintiff-respondent being influenced by superintendent of police forcibly entered into the house of the defendant-petitioner and managed to have a signature from him on blank stamp paper and thereafter filed the Suit.<br/><br/>The learned Assistant Judge and Family Court, Narail by the judgment and decree dated 20.01.2004 decreed the suit.<br/><br/>The defendant being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and decree dated 20.01.2004 preferred an appeal being Family Appeal No.03 of 2004 in the Court of District Judge, Narail who by the judgment and decree dated 02.10.2004 dismissed the appeal.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and decree dated 02.10.2004 passed by the learned District Judge, Narail the defendant-petitioner  moved the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.2325 of 2005 and a Single Bench of the High Court Division by the impugned judgment and decree dated 29.10.2008 discharged the Rule affirming those passed by the learned District Judge.<br/><br/>Thereafter the defendant-petitioner being aggrieved by the impugned judgment and decree passed by a Single Bench of the High Court Division moved the instant civil petition for leave to appeal before this Division.<br/><br/>Mr. Abul Kalam Mainuddin, the learned Advocate appearing for the defendant-petitioner submits that the High Court Division failed to notice that there is no single evidence showing valid marriage under the Hindu Law by invocation before sacred fire and saptapadi performed by the couple and as such the impugned judgment and decree is liable to be set aside. He then submits that the plaintiff-respondent did not adduce any evidence of wedding ceremony but the courts below failed to consider this aspect of the matter and as such the impugned judgment and decree is liable to be set aside. Mr. Mainuddin finally submits that since the defendant-petitioner denied the marriage the onus lies upon the plaintiff-respondent to prove marriage between them but the plaintiff-respondent failed to prove their marriage and as such the impugned judgment and decree passed by the High Court Division is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>We have heard the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner, perused the impugned judgment and decree of the High Court Division and other materials on record.<br/><br/>The pertinent question in this case is whether the defendant-petitioner had married the plaintiff-respondent according to Hindu Law. It appears that the plaintiff-respondent as P.W.1 deposed in support of her case stating that she having fallen in love with the defendant-petitioner married him according to the ceremonies prescribed by the Hindu “Shastras” in presence of the brother of the petitioner; that she cannot say whether the ‘Brahmin’ who solemanized the ceremonies of the marriage is alive or not; that she stated the photograph which was taken during marriage; that she wore “Shakha and Sindur”; that she lived with him in a house as husband and wife and she left her husband’s house because of his torture and demand of dowry; that she lodged complaint to the superintendent of police; that there was a conciliation by local superintendent of police when the petitioner gave an undertaking to take her in his house where she stayed with him. The plaintiff-respondent also proved that marriage took place in the Rajshahi Kali Mondir in presence of the witnesses and brother of defendant-petitioner. The plaintiff-respondent’s neighbour Nirmal Kumar Gupta as P.W.2 corroborated the evidence of the plaintiff P.W.1 stating that the defendant married the plaintiff in Rajshahi in his presence; that the puruhit solemnized the marriage in Kalibari Rajshahi according to Hindu Shastra and the defendant-petitioner’s brother offered him; that a cameraman of Rajshahi took photograph of the marriage ceremony. The plaintiff-respondent’s uncle Maharaj Biswas as P.W.3 also corroborated the evidence of P.W.l and P.W.2 stating that he offered her niece in marriage to the defendant-petitioner and the Puruhit solemnized the marriage by reciting “mantra” in the Kalibari Rajshahi in his presence and Nirmal went to Rajshahi with him. P.W.1 to P.W.3 by their evidence proved that after the marriage both the plaintiff and the defendant lived together in the same house in Rajshahi as husband and wife. P.W.4-Tarafdar Rezaul Islam, a resident of the locality and common friend of both of them deposed that he has no enmity with the defendant-petitioner and P.W.4 also corroborated the plaintiff-respondent’s statement in respect of compromise agreement in the Office of the Superintendent of Police where the defendant and other witnesses were present. The defendant did not deny the fact of this compromise in the presence of P.W.4. Exhibit-l-voter-list shows that the defendant has been shown as the husband of the plaintiff and they have also joint photograph as husband and wife marked as Exhibit-3. Both the trial court and the court of appeal below as the final court of facts on consideration of both oral and documentary evidence on record found that they united in marriage and there is a relationship of husband and wife between them.<br/><br/>According to Mulla there is an extreme strong presumption of the validity of marriage and the legitimacy of children born out of the lawful marriage if from the time of the alleged marriage both the parties are recognized by all persons concerned as man and wife and also described in important documents and on important occasions. It has been held in the case of Chellammal and others –Vs- Ranganatham Pillai and others, (1911) ILR 34 Mad 277 that the fact that a woman was living under the control and protection of a man who generally lived with her and acknowledged her children arises strong presumption that she is the wife of that man. But the same presumption can be rebutted showing that no marriage could have taken place. In the instant case from the material evidence on record we find that there was evidence of compromise by the plaintiff and the defendant in presence of P.W.4; that voter list Exhibit-1 shows that the defendant is the husband of the plaintiff and there was also evidence of joint photograph as husband and wife. All these evidences support the case of the plaintiff-respondent that there was a valid marriage between the petitioner and the respondent. However, there is also an argument in the modern society that recognition by family of both the parties or community is not a pre-condition for a valid marriage. While considering this aspect of marriage Supreme Court of India in the case of Mrs. Valsamma Paul vs Cochin University and Others, AIR 1996 SC 1011, observed as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Though it was consistently held that recognition is a circumstance to be taken into consideration, marriage being personal right of the spouses they are entitled to live, after marriage, openly to the knowledge of all the members of the community or locality in which they live and by such living they acquire married status. In the light of the constitutional philosophy of social integrity and national unity, right to equality assured by the human rights and the Constitution of India, on marriage of a man and a woman, they become members of the family and entitled to the social status as married couple, recognition per se is not a pre-condition but entitled to be considered, when evidence is available. It is common knowledge that with education or advance of economic status, young men and women marry against the wishes of parents and in many a case consent or recognition would scarcely be given by either or both the parties or parents of both spouses. Recognition by family or community is not a pre-condition for married status.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The concept of marriage in Hindu Law has been propounded in several cases decided by the Indian Supreme Court. In the case of Swarajya Lakshmi vs Dr. G.G. Padma Rao, AIR 1974 SC 165, it was observed, “Marriage according to Hindu Law, is a sacrament and a holy union for the performance of religious duties.”<br/><br/>In the same way in the case of V. Tulasamma &amp; Others vs V. Sesha Reddi (Dead) By L. Rs, AIR 1977 SC 1944, it was observed, “Under the Shastric Hindu Law, a marriage, unlike a marriage under the Mohammadan Law which is purely contractual in nature, is a sacrament – a religious seremony which results in a sacred and a holy union of man and wife by virtue of which the wife is completely transplanted in the household of her husband and takes a new birth as a partner of her husband becoming a part and parcel of the body of the husband.”<br/> <br/>The Hindu Shasrya Law enjoins all men to marry for the purpose of procreating a son necessary for the continuation of line of paternal ancestors and for the spiritual benefit of their soul. It is known to all that the ancient Hindu law recognized eight forms of marriage, of which four were approved forms and the others were unapproved forms. The approved forms were Brahma, Daiva, Araha and Prajapatya and the unapproved forms were Asura, Gandharva, Rakshasa and Paisacha. Presently two forms of marriage are recognized, namely, (i) the Brahma form, which is one of the approved forms; and (ii) the Asura form, which is one of the unapproved forms. In the case of A.L.V.R.S.T. Veerappa Chettiar vs S. Michael Etc, AIR 1963 SC 933, the essence of the Asura marriage was discussed by the Supreme Court of India in following terms:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The essence of the said marriage is the sale of a bride for a price and it is one of the unapproved forms of marriage prohibited by Manu for all the four castes of Hindu society. The vice of the said marriage lies in the receipt of the price by the bride’s father or other persons entitled to give away the bride as a consideration for the bride. If the amount paid or the ornaments given is not the consideration for taking the bride but only given to the bride or even to the bride’s father out of affection or in token of respect to them or to comply with a traditional or ritualistic form, such payment does not make the marriage an A’sura marriage.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The distinction between the approved and unapproved forms of marriage is that wife married in a approved form becomes ‘Patni’ but in an disapproved form she does not become ‘Patni’. In this modern days the distinction between ‘Brahma’ or ‘Asura’ form of marriage is immaterial. In above mentioned case (AIR 1963 SC 933) it was held that whenever a question arises whether a marriage is a Brahma or Asura, the presumption is that the marriage is in Brahma form and the burden is upon the person who asserts the contrary to prove that the marriage was either an Asura or any other form.<br/> <br/>According to the Principles of Hindu Law by Mulla 21<sup>st</sup> Edition (2010) when a question arises as to whether a marriage was in the ‘Brahma’ form or the ‘Asura’ form, the court would presume, even where the parties are Shudras; that it is in the ‘Brahma’ form i.e. no consideration for the marriage passed from the bridegroom to the father or other guardian of the bride. But this presumption may be rebutted by showing that the marriage was in the ‘Asura’ form. The Apex Courts of the Sub-continent including this Court in a number of cases held that where a question arises as to whether a marriage was in approved or in unapproved form, the presumption is that it was in approved form unless the contrary is proved. If the celebration of marriage in fact is established then there shall be a presumption of there being a marriage in law and the observance of the essential ceremonies. Generally there are two ceremonies essential to the validity of a marriage either in the Brahma form or in the Asura form, namely, (i) invocation before the sacred fire, and (ii) saptapadi, i.e. the taking of seven steps by the bridegroom and the bride jointly before the sacred fire.<br/> <br/>The marriage becomes completed when the seventh step is taken. Before that step it is imperfect and revocable. (Chunilal –Vs- Surajram (1909) 33 Bom. 433).  In the case of Kally Churn –Vs- Dukhee (1880) ILR 5 Cal.692 it has been held that apart from the complete performance of the two ceremonies a marriage may be completed when custom of the caste allows otherwise. The essential requisite for recognition of such a custom is that it must be sufficiently ancient and definite and the members of the caste or sub-caste or family must recognise it as obligatory. But those customs  cannot be altered by the will and pleasure of the caste or sub-caste to whom the parties belong. When the caste has been able to establish its usage regulating the form and the requisites of a valid marriage, such a usage being transcendent law is obligatory and is binding upon the parties. The Courts are bound to recognise the usage giving effect to the same. In the case of Utpal Kanti Das –Vs- Monju Rani Das reported in 17 BLD (AD) 289, this Division enumerated the usual ceremonies of Hindu Marriage which are as follows:<br/><br/><strong>(a)     </strong>On the forenoon of the day fixed for marriage “Nandimukha” or “Vriddhi Sraddha” is performed. The bride’s father or other male relation invokes the departed souls of the ancestors and make offerings to them to get their blessings.<br/><strong>(b)</strong>     In the evening when the bridegroom comes in a procession to the bride’s place the bridal party is received with great hospitality and the bridegroom is given a ceremonious reception by the near relations of the bride, making over to him new wearing apparels.<br/><strong>(c)</strong>     The bridegroom dressed up in new clothings is then circled by the bride seven times, at the end of which the bride and the bridegroom exchange garlands of flowers.<br/><strong>(d)</strong>     Then follows ‘sampradana’ or gift of the bride to the bridegroom.”<br/><br/>This Division further observed as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“17. It is obvious that nuptial rites in Hindu Shastra are so complicated that an exact observance of their details is not easy and is beyond the comprehension of the ordinary participants or the attendants of the ceremony. But once the celebration of a marriage in fact is established there shall be a presumption of there being a marriage in law and observance of the essential ceremonies.” [17 BLD (AD) 289 at page 292]</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the same judgment [17 BLD (AD) 289) at paragraph 8 his Lordship referred to the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant wherein it was argued that on paragraph 437 of Mulla’s “Principles of Hindu Law” (eleventh edition) and also on “A Treatise of Hindu Law” by Golapchandra Sarkar Sastri (sixth edition), chapter III on marriage, two essential ceremonies to the validity of a Hindu marriage have been categorically enumerated. They are, namely, (1) invocation before the sacred fire, and (2) steps by the bridegroom and the bride jointly before the sacred fire which is known as saptapadi.<br/> <br/>Supreme Court of India in the case of Bhaurao Shankar Lokhande &amp; Anr vs State of Maharashtra &amp; Anr, AIR 1965 SC 1564 while determining what the essential ceremonies for a valid marriage are, cited Mullas Hindu Law, 12<sup>th</sup> Edition as authority where in it has been stated as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“(1) There are two ceremonies essential to the validity of a marriage, whether the marriage be in the Brahma form or the Asura form, namely-</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">invocation before the sacred fire, and</li><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">saptapadi, that is, the taking of seven steps by the bridegroom and the bride jointly before the sacred fire.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(2) A marriage may be completed by the performance of ceremonies other than those referred to in subsection (1), where it is allowed by the custom of the caste to which the parties belong.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From the above discussion it is abundantly clear that there are two ceremonies essential to the validity of a marriage whether the marriage be in the Brahma form or the Asura form. The ceremonies are (1) invocation before the sacred fire and (2) saptapadi, that is, the taking of seven steps by the bridegroom and the bride jointly before the sacred fire.<br/><br/>On meticulous scrutiny of the evidence of the witnesses and other materials on record it has been proved that in the instant case marriage was performed in fact and therefore we can safely presume that marriage is valid in law and all the necessary ceremonies have been performed. There is no evidence to the contrary to show that no marriage ceremony was solemnized according to Hindu Shastra. In the instant case the respondent proved that the ceremonies prescribed by the Shastra were performed. The defendant-petitioner as D.W.1 did not depose that no “Saptapadi” was performed before the sacred fire. Therefore, the petitioner having not raised the plea of invalidity of marriage because of non-performance of an essential rite any plea to the effect that the marriage is bad in law for want of any essential ceremony such as Saptapadi is not tenable in law.  <br/><br/>It is well established that the marriage between man and woman is inseparable under Hindu Law. In Shastriya Hindu Law marriage is treated as sacrament not a contract. It appears that the trial court having considered the material evidence on record rightly found that the marriage between the plaintiff-respondent and the defendant-petitioner was duly completed by the performance of the essential ceremonies which have made the marriage valid in law; that they lived together as husband and wife till she was driven out from the house of her husband and the court of appeal below as the final court of facts made concurrent findings of facts and rightly affirmed the judgment and decree passed by the trial Court and the High Court Division being the revisional Court having considered the evidence of the witnesses and findings of the courts below found that there are concurrent findings of facts by both the trial court and the court of appeal below and as such there is no illegality in the impugned judgment and decree passed by the High Court Division.<br/><br/>Marriage under the traditional Hindu Law is a holy union for the performance of religious duties. It is a sacrament for the purification of the body from inherited taint. It is not a contract. Of course the marriage is necessarily the basis of social organization and the foundation of important legal rights and obligations. In view of the modern social dimensions the Hindu Community in this Country in respect of marriage, divorce and inheritance faces multifarious problems. In many cases the alleged husband does not recognize marriage or deny the existence of marriage with the female partner and the female partner also faces difficulty in respect of her right to inheritance and the issues of the marriage are also sometime disowned by the male partner to be the legitimate offspring of their wed-lock and as such, the children sometimes find difficulty to get recognition and their right of inheritance. In consequence of these varying problems being faced by the Hindu Community in this Country where the society has advanced and the women are also very much conscious about their rights  and status in respect of marriage, divorce, inheritance, we believe  time  has  come to think about the social needs and the demand of  different  Hindu  Women  right activists and other social and non-government organizations for codification of the Hindu Law of marriage and succession. We are not unmindful about the other fractions of the society, who are not in favour of any codification of the Hindu Law in this Country. We are very much conscious about the extreme sensitive issue involved in this particular matter. But our view is that far reaching and fundam-ental changes could be achieved  and  we   shall  be able to  have  fair  and  equitable  solution to some of the most difficult questions relating to the law of marriage and succession in consequent thereof. It is our earnest desire and belief that an uniform and comprehensive system governing all Hindus containing a series of coherent provisions carefully considered after having gone through by eminent pundits and researc-hers and law commission a codification of Hindu Law of marriage and succession should be enacted. We have seen that our closest neighbour India has enacted Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 which embodied all the necessary provisions of Hindu Law and thereby promu-lgated all rules of the law of marriage or custom or usage having the force of law in respect of all these matters which are properly dealt with in the Act of 1955. The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 supersedes any other law contained in any central or state legislation in force immediately before the enactment of the Act. We are of the view that enactment of codified Hindu Law is not only a pious desire of a section of the Hindu rights activists or some of  the NGOs  of  this country but also majority people of the country.  In our deep anxiety we have noticed that time has come for the legislators to think about the codification of the Hindu Law of Marriage and Succession in Bangladesh. Sometimes, Female Partners and the children are being deprived of their rights.<br/><br/>To our utter dismay some-times we find that the male partner disowned the very existence of the marriage including the children born out of the wed-lock. In the instant case we have also found that both the plaintiff-respondent and the defendant-petitioner having fallen in love with each other during their university days ultimately united in marriage at Rajshahi Kali Mandir in presence of witnesses and relations of both the parties. The High Court Division rightly found that the Trial Court and the Court of appeal below made concurrent findings of facts that there was a valid marriage in law between the parties. But to our utter surprise the defendant-petitioner, the husband of the plaintiff-respondent denied the very existence and validity of the marriage between them which is very unfortunate. Had there been proper codification of Hindu Law of marriage and succession with a provision for registration of marriage definitely the male partner could not have denied the solemnization of marriage ceremony between the parties. However, time has come for the legislature to think about this burning issue to find out correct solution to the problem by proper enactment or codification of Hindu Law of marriage and succession. If the codification of the Hindu Law is made, it is our considered view that most of the matrimonial problems now being faced by both the parties can be resolved or minimized with least trouble.<br/>  <br/>Since there is no misreading or non-consideration of any material evidence on record, the High Court Division rightly passed the impugned judgment and decree in discharging the Rule and affirming the judgment and degree passed by the learned District Judge, Narail. In view of the above findings and observations we do not find any merit in the leave petition.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the leave petition is dismissed with cost of Tk. 5,000/- (five thousand).<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Approximately two months prior to filing of the case his mother-in-law took his sister-in-law Surja Begum (deceased victim) from his residence to her residence at Bangla Motor. On 16.06.2000 at about 10.30 p.m. his mother-in-law along with accused Farid came to the informant’s house at Manikgonj and told him that Surja had gone out of the house at 11.00 a.m. with Tk.3,300/- and her wherea-bouts could not be traced. At that time both Rokeya Begum and accused Farid were found to be sweating. Rokeya Begum was found barefooted and on query by her daughter, i.e. the informant’s wife, as to why she was not wearing her sandals, Rokeya Begum told her that at the time of boarding the bus one of the sandals fell and that is why the other one was thrown away. Rokeya Begum and Farid had their meal at the informant’s house and they stayed there for the night and in the morning they left for Dhaka. At about 7.00 a.m. the informant came to know from a co-villager that a dead body was found in the sugarcane field of co-villager Jaber Mollah. Having heard this, the informant went there and identified the dead body as that of his sister-in-law Surja Begum. Her throat was found tied with a scarf and the eyes were found to be damaged. The informant found a pair of shoes and one piece of sandal by the side of the dead body and the said sandal was identified as that of Rokeya Begum. The informant came to Dhaka and at first he went to the Chinese Restaurant where his mother-in-law used to work. There he met one of his co-villagers namely Siraj and enquired about his mother-in-law, sister-in-law and accused Farid. Siraj told him that all three left for Surja Begum’s maternal uncle’s house at Adamji on the previous day, i.e. 15.06.2000 at 5.00 p.m. The informant got suspicious and went to the residence of his mother-in-law at Bangla Motor. The informant disclosed to his mother-in-law about the recovery of the dead body of Surja Begum and took his mother-in-law to his house at Manikgonj and there she confessed to have killed Surja Begum with the help of accused Farid alias Reza. It is alleged that the informant’s mother-in-law had an illicit relationship with accused Farid and since Surja Begum disliked and protested it she was killed by strangulation. Hence, the informant lodged the First Information Report (F.I.R.) on 18.06.2000 before the Officer-in-Charge of Manikgonj Police Station, Manikgonj against the condemned prisoners under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code. Accordingly, Manikgonj P.S. Case No.13 dated 18.06.2000 corresponding to G.R. No. 307/2000 was started.<br/>  <br/>The Investigating Officer visited the place of occurrence, prepared the sketch map with index, prepared inquest report, examined the witnesses and recorded their statements under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. After completion of investigation he submitted Charge-sheet No.113 dated 30.11.2000 under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code against the two accused persons.<br/><br/>The case was ultimately transferred to the Court of Sessions Judge, Manikgonj where it was numbered as Sessions Case No.02 of 2001. Charge was framed under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code against the accused persons and read over and explained to them, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. During trial the prosecution examined as many as 20 (twenty) P.Ws. who were cross-examined by the defence, but the defence did not examine any witness.<br/><br/>The defence case, as it transpires from the trend of cross-examination was that the accused persons were innocent and they had been falsely implicated in the case.<br/><br/>After close of recording of evidence, the accused persons were examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. They repeated their innocence.<br/><br/>The Sessions Judge, Manikgonj after hearing the parties and upon consideration of the evidence and materials on record convicted the accused persons under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code and sentenced them to death by his judgement and order dated 08.08.2001.<br/><br/>Reference under section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was made to the High Court Division for confirmation of the sentence of death, which was registered as Death Reference No.34 of 2001.<br/><br/>Before the High Court Division Jail Appeal No.3201 of 2001 was preferred by the condemned petitioner, which was heard along with the death reference. By the impugned judgement and order, the High Court Division accepted the reference and dismissed the jail appeal and confirmed the judgement and order of conviction and sentence passed by the Sessions Judge, Manikgonj.<br/><br/>The condemned prisoners filed Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No.311 of 2004 with Jail Petition No.3 of 2005.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Nawab Ali, submitted that since it was a case of capital sentence the right of appeal is guaranteed under the Constitution. He further submitted that he would not argue on merit rather he would argue only on ground of sentence. After hearing, leave was granted only to consider the sentence of the condemned petitioner.<br/><br/>Mr Muhammad Nawab Ali, the learned Advocate-on-Record appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that the case against the petitioner is one of murdering her own daughter. This, he submitted was unnatural to contemplate. He submitted that there is no ocular or direct evidence against the petitioner and she has been convicted on the basis of tenuous circumstantial evidence. He submitted that even if the petitioner had any part in the murder, which is highly unlikely, it was neither proper nor just to award the death sentence in the facts and circumstances of the case. He prayed that the sentence of death may be commuted, keeping in view that the petitioner is an old lady who has suffered through the loss of her own daughter.<br/><br/>Mr. Shohrowardi, the learned Deputy Attorney General, appearing on behalf of the State-respondent made submissions in support of the impugned judgement and order of the High Court Division. He submitted that when a mother plots and carries out the murder of her own child in order to cover up her illicit relationship, she does not deserve any sympathy. He submitted that the prosecution has been able to prove her involvement in the murder and there is no scope to reduce the sentence in the facts and circumstances disclosed by the evidence on record.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocate-on-Record for the appellant and the learned Deputy Attorney General for the Respondent and perused the impugned judgement of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record.<br/><br/><span style="font-size:16px"><u><strong><span style="font-size:14px">The relevant law:</span></strong></u></span><br/><br/>The law relating to murder in Bangladesh is based upon sections 299 and 300 of the Penal Code which define culpable homicide and murder. Just by way of comparison, it is noted that the same law applies in neighbouring India. However, over the years the procedures followed and matters considered before passing sentence for murder under section 302 of the Penal Code has varied. In Bangladesh the sentence for murder is death, or imprisonment for life. Hence, it is the normal course upon finding the accused guilty of an offence under section 302 of the Penal Code to sentence him to death unless any extenuating circumstances lead the Court to award the lesser sentence of imprisonment for life, and for that he would have to give his reasons. So, effectively the burden lies on the accused to provide grounds for awarding the lesser sentence.<br/> <br/>On the other hand, in India the sentence for murder under section 302 of the Penal Code is similarly either death or life imprisonment, but the difference is that life sentence is considered to be the norm and the sentence of death is to be awarded only in the rarest of rare cases.<br/> <br/>At this juncture it may be noted that in Bangladesh there is no longer in existence any provision for a sentence hearing, which existed under sections 250K(2) and 265K(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure which were introduced by the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1978 (Ordinance No. XLIX of 1978) which provided as follows:   </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“250K(2):”Where, in any case under this Chapter, the Magistrate finds the accused guilty, but does not proceed in accordance with the provisions of section 349 or section 562, he shall, after hearing the accused on the question of sentence, pass sentence upon him according to law”.<br/>265K(2):”If the accused is convicted, the Court shall, unless it proceeds in accordance with the provisions of section 562, hear the accused on the question of sentence, and then pass sentence on him according to law”. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>These two provisions provided the opportunity to the accused to plead for a lesser sentence.<br/> <br/>However, these two provisions were subsequently omitted by section 21 of Ordinance XXIV, 1982 and section 3 of Ordinance XXXVII, 1983 respectively. On the other hand, section 325(2) of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 provides for a hearing of the accused on question of sentence, which was held in the case of Santa Singh Vs. State of Punjab reported in AIR 1976 (SC) 2386 to be a mandatory provision. In the said decision it was held as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“This Court has taken the view that under the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, it is incumbent on the Sessions Judge delivering a judgement of conviction to stay his hands and hear the accused on the question of sentence and give him an opportunity to lead evidence which may also be allowed to be rebutted by the prosecution”.      </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the context of Bangladesh it is noted that in the prevailing adversarial system, there is very little scope for any accused persons to urge any plea in mitigation during the course of trial or at the time of examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The accused practically stands by while his lawyer pleads for him. At the time of examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure he is simply told what evidence has been placed against him and asked to comment on that evidence and he is asked whether he will produce any defence witness or say anything further. Having pleaded not guilty all through the trial, it is felt that any plea in mitigation at this stage would weaken the case of the accused. So, he says nothing more. In the absence of a sentence hearing there is no opportunity for the accused to bring to the notice of the Court any extenuating circumst-ances. The learned Judge conducting trial considers the points of view of the accused only so far as it is exposed during cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses and the statement of the accused given at the time of examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It must be borne in mind that those aspects elicited by the defence counsel during cross-examination of prosecution witnesses are merely with the view to exonerate the accused from the charge levelled against him. The mitigating circumstances bearing around the accused, his family, social, economic and educational background etc. are seldom given any mention or importance. Thus there is little scope for the trial Judge to consider any mitigating or extenuating circum-stances other than those directly apparent from the prosecution evidence as having existed at the time of commission of the offence. This in my opinion puts the accused at a serious disadvantage so far as sentencing is concerned. Moreover, there being no sentencing guidelines, the tendency is for trial Judges to award the highest possible sentence provided by the law.<br/> <br/><u><strong>Sentence of death or imprisonment for life:</strong></u><br/><br/>As mentioned earlier, according to the prevailing decisions in Bangladesh, the sentence for murder under section 302 of the Penal Code is death or imprisonment for life and also fine. The dichotomy of awarding sentence of death or life imprisonment has been raging for decades across the globe. As of the present day 35 out of 50 States in the USA still retain the death penalty. The countries of the European Union as well as European countries outside the Union have abolished the death penalty. On the other hand, India, being the largest democracy of the world has retained the death penalty.<br/> <br/><u><strong>England abolished the death penalty:</strong></u><br/><br/>The Royal Commission on Capital Punishment 1949-53 was set up to consider and report whether “capital punishment for murder should be limited or modified”. The Commission recommended retention of capital punishment unless there was overwhelming public support for abolition, which there wasn’t. Under the terms of the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965 hanging was suspended for an experimental period of five years. On the 16th of December 1969, the House of Commons reaffirmed its decision that capital punishment for murder should be permanently abolished. However, the death penalty was retained for offences like treason and piracy with violence until 1998. In 1999 the home secretary signed the sixth protocol of the European Convention of Human Rights which formally abolished the death penalty in the UK and ensured it could not be brought back.<br/> <br/>Upon scrutiny of the 35th Report of the Law Commission on Capital Punishment, 1967, India retained the death penalty. There was lengthy discussion on the issue by the Indian Supreme Court in the case of Bachan Singh Vs. the State of Punjab (1980)2 SCC 684 (report published in 1967). Suffice it to say that India has found the sentence of death to be lawful penalty to be awarded, whereas in England death penalty was not favoured as a proper or necessary punishment.<br/> <br/><u><strong>Meaning of life sentence: </strong></u><br/><br/>It can be stated that sentence of “imprisonment for life” as used in Bangladesh is utterly a misnomer; indeed it appears to be an erroneous interpretation. The way it has been interpreted, the word “life“ does not bear its normal linguistic meaning. In other words, a person sentenced to imprisonment for life does not necessarily spend his life in prison, although section 45 of the Penal Code defines “Life” as the life of a human being unless the contrary appears from the context. The given interpretation has been arrived at with the aid of section 57 of the Penal Code, which provides that in calculating fraction of terms of punishment, imprisonment for life shall be reckoned as equivalent to rigorous imprisonment for 30(thirty) years. This last mentioned section read with relevant provision of the Jail Code effectively means that a person sentenced to imprisonment for life will be released after spending a maximum of 22 years in prison. Under section 35A of the Code of Criminal Procedure the period of time spent by the accused in custody during pendency of the trial would be deducted from his total sentence. Thus we find that in many serious murder cases, where the trial lasts for many years, the accused who is found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment for life gets released after serving a total of 22½ years including the period spent in custody during trial. Hence, the sentence of imprisonment for life imposed at the time of delivery of judgement appears to be a lenient sentence and may in the minds of some appear to be not a proper sentence, especially when some horrific facts are disclosed in evidence.<br/> <br/>Criminal justice in Bangladesh is guided by the Penal Code, 1860, the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and the Evidence Act, 1872, all vestiges of British rule, which ended 66 years ago. The law in England has over the years transformed and developed and looks nothing like the law which the British left behind for us. Just to give one example, which is relevant in the present context, life sentence in England can mean any period of sentence measured in years and months which the Court feels is an appropriate period in the facts and circumstances of the case and can extend to a sentence of imprisonment for life which would mean that the prisoner would not be allowed to leave the prison throughout his natural life. Such a punishment is arguably “a fate worse than death”. Reference may be made to the famous case of the Moors murder where the accused Ian Brady and Myra Hindley were found guilty of murder of several children which took place between July 1963 and October 1965. Both the accused were sentenced to imprisonment for life and several appeals against their life sentence were made. But they were never released. Myra Hindley died in prison when she was aged 60; the other convict was declared insane and has been repeatedly asking to be allowed to die. This case clearly shows that for a criminal sentenced of impriso-nment for life meaning the rest of his life, death would have been a softer option. Hindley who was sentenced to life in 1966 just after the death penalty was abolished wrote in a letter; ”I knew I was a selfish coward but I could not bear the thought of being hanged. Although over the years I wish I had been” (as reported on BBC news dated 29.02.2000).<br/> <br/>This day we find that in many countries, including England, after a sentence of life imprisonment is imposed the Judge may specifically order that the prisoner is not to be released before the expiry of a term of years which can be any number of years ranging from 10 to 60 years or even for the rest of his natural life, so long as the Judge follows the sentencing guideline issued by the appropriate authority. In the past the Lord Chief Justice sitting in the Court of Appeal issued sentencing guidelines by way of judgements. The Sentencing Council for England and Wales was established in April 2010, replacing the Sentencing Guidelines Council and the Sentencing Advisory Panel, its predecessor bodies.   <br/> <br/>In Bangladesh there is no specific authority to issue any sentencing guideline and as a result Judges are guided only by the sentences provided in the Penal Code and other special laws, and life sentence, in some cases, turns out to be a relatively lenient sentence. It is in this backdrop that many Judges choose the sentence of death for crimes which they consider to be most heinous since that effectively is the harshest punishment. Had there been any provision in our law for gradation of the life sentence or for expressing the view that the convict shall not be released during his life time, or for a specified number of years, then perhaps the Judges would opt for the longer life imprisonment, which may be considered a more harsh punishment than death. Moreover, as we have explained above, the trial procedure does not allow for any effective plea in mitigation after the verdict is pronounced. As a result the sentencing in most cases is arbitrary and there is no scope for the accused to plead for a lesser sentence or for the trial judge to take into account any mitigating circumstances since there was no opportunity to place any before him.<br/> <br/>In considering the sentence of the appellant before us, we may aptly refer to the decision in Nalu Vs. The State, 32 BLD (AD) 247 where this Division referred to the following mitigating circumstances which are also relevant in the facts of the instant case:<br/><br/>The condemned prisoner has no history of prior criminal activity.<br/><br/>The condemned prisoner is not likely to commit any further act of violence.<br/><br/>She has been in the condemned cell since 8.8.2001, i.e. more than 11 years during which period the hangman’s noose has been dangling in front of her eyes.<br/> <br/>We may also refer to the case of Hazer Ali Mandal and others Vs. The State, 37 DLR (AD) 87. In that case the conviction and death sentence was based on circumstantial evidence. The High Court Division commuted the sentence of death to one of imprisonment for life. This Division upheld the decision of the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>Returning to the facts of the instant case, it appears that there is no direct evidence against the appellant of having taken any part in the killing of the victim, her own daughter. The confessional statement of the co-accused is no evidence by itself when considering the complicity of another co-accused, and can only be used to lend support to other evidence. In her own confessional statement the appellant did not inculpate herself in the assault on the victim. However, her subsequent conduct in confessing before the witnesses points a finger towards her complicity, but not to the extent of it. In such circumstances, the conviction of the appellant under section 302/34 cannot be said to be without basis or illegal. But in the light of the evidence it would not be consonant to justice to impose capital punishment on the appellant.<br/><br/>With regard to the period of time spent by the accused in the condemned cell, there are numerous decisions of this Division which shed light to this aspect. In general terms, it may be stated that the length of period spent by a convict in the condemned cell is not necessarily a ground for commutation of the sentence of death. However, where the period spent in the condemned cell is not due to any fault of the convict and where the period spent there is inordinately long, it may be considered as an extenuating ground sufficient for commutation of sentence of death. It is noted that the High Court Division in rejecting this plea in other cases referred to the case of Abed Ali Vs. the State, 10 BLD (AD) 89. In that case this Division noted the observation of the High Court Division in the case of Nowsher Ali and other Vs the State, 39 DLR 57, that delay in execution cannot by itself constitute a mitigating circumstance but a delay of six years may be considered for commutation of death sentence to life imprisonment (emphasis added). When the case of Nowsher Ali came before this Division, it was held that “In some cases inordinate delay in execution of death sentence may be considered a ground for commuting it to transportation for life but some delay such as in this case should not be considered to be a ground for commutation, particularly when the delay is not due to any laches of the prosecution. In that case the condemned prisoner had been in the condemned cell for about 4 years. However, their Lordships in fact commuted the death sentence on the ground of bitter matri-monial relationship which played a part. In the instant case, when the matter was heard by the High Court Division the convict had been in the condemned cell for less than three years, and hence the plea was not put forward. However, the convict has now been in the condemned cell for more than 11 years, which is beyond the threshold of six years mentioned by this Division in the Abed Ali case cited above. Thus the length of period by now can be taken as one of the reasons to commute the sentence of death to one of imprisonment for life.<br/> <br/>In the light of the above discussion, we are of the view that the judgement of the High Court Division be upheld so far as it relates to conviction of the appellant under section 302/34 of the Penal Code. The Criminal Appeal is, therefore, dismissed. However, in the light of the discussion regarding sentence, we are of the view that in the facts and circumstances of the case justice will be sufficiently met if the sentence of death is commuted to one of imprisonment for life. Accordingly, the sentence of the convict Rokeya Begum alias Rokaya Begum is modified to imprisonment for life.<br/><br/>With regard to Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No.342 of 2007, filed by condemned prisoner Faridur Rahman @ Reza, Mr. Md. Nawab Ali made similar submissions with a view to commutation of the sentence of death to one of imprisonment for life. He submitted that the condemned prisoner is in the prime of his life and has suffered in the condemned cell for over 11 years. However, unlike the evidence against the appellant Rokeya, the inculpatory confession of accused Foridur Rahman alias Forid alias Raza establishes the case against him beyond any shadow of doubt. This considered alongside the other circumstantial evidence against him, we are not inclined to interfere with the judgement and order of the High Court Division passed against the petitioner Foridur Rahman alias Forid alias Raza. Hence the Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal is dismissed along with Jail Petition No. 03 of 2005.<br/><br/><strong>            Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

A. No.343 of 2003 dismissing the appeals and affirming the judgment and decree dated 05.08.2003 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, Second Court, Dhaka in Title Suit No.270 of 2002 and judgment and decree dated 17.09.2003 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, Third Court, Dhaka in Title Suit No.149 of 2002 rejecting the plaints of both the suits.<br/><br/>Both the civil petitions for leave to appeal arising out of the common judgment and order between the same parties and  involving common question of law and fact having been heard together are disposed of by this single judgment.<br/> <br/>The facts leading to the filing of both the civil petitions for leave to appeal, in brief, are:<br/><br/>         The plaintiff instituted Title Suit No.149 of 2002 and Title Suit No.270 of 2002 for declaration that he is the owner of the suit property and that the defendant-wife is his benamdar and is not the owner thereof. The plaintiff’s case, in short, is that he married defendant No.1, Mrs. Fatema Begum who is a simple house wife had no source of income and dependent on the plaintiff-husband. The plaintiff being an industrialist and with motive to get income tax relief purchased the suit property being urban property in the “benami” of defendant No.1 and that the plaintiff purchased the suit property with his own money and he has been residing in the suit property with his family treating the same as his own property. Defendant No.1 knew that the plaintiff purchased the suit property in the “benami” of defendant No.1 who was claiming ownership of the suit property at the behest of her father and brother. Hence, the suit has been filed by the plaintiff for declaration of title in the suit property.<br/> <br/>Defendant No.1 contested the suit by filing an application under Order VII Rule 11(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure for rejection of the plaint, contending, inter alia, that under the provision of section 5 of the Land Reforms Ordinance,1984 (hereinafter referred as “the Ordinance”), the suit of the plaintiff is barred as benami transaction is prohibited. <br/> <br/>The plaintiff filed written objection against defendant’s application for rejection of the plaint. His case is that the suit property is urban property and that the Land Reforms Ordinance,1984 has been promulgated with the object to reform the land relating to land tenures, land holding and transfer with a view to maximizing production and ensuring a better relationship between land owners and bargaders and the provisions of the entire Ordinance are relating to agricultural and cultivable land holding and transfers and not relating to urban land, and the provisions of section 5 of the said Ordinance do not apply to non-agricultural urban land transfer, and the application of defendant No.1 for rejection of the plaint is liable to be rejected.<br/> <br/>The trial Court by the judgments and orders dated 17.09.2003 and 05.08.2003 rejected the plaints of both the suits.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgments and orders dated 17.09.2003 and 05.08.2003 passed by the trial Court, the plaintiff preferred First Appeal Nos.322 and 343 of 2003 before the High Court Division. The learned Judges of the High Court Division, upon hearing the parties in both the appeals, by its judgment and order dated 26.04.2010 dismissed both the appeals. <br/> <br/>Feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division, the plaintiff has filed these civil petitions for leave to appeal before this Division.<br/> <br/>Mr. Mahmudul Islam, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the leave-petitioner in both the petitions, submits that if the Land Reforms Ordinance,1984 is considered as a whole, it will appear that prohibition of benami transaction of “immoveable property” applies only in respect of agricultural land and that the High Court Division having considered the provision of section 5 of the Ordinance in particular, came to the finding that section 5 of the Ordinance applies to both agricultural and non-agricultural land. He further submits that section 5 of the Ordinance undoubtedly relates to agricultural land and the purpose of the Ordinance is to maximize production and to that end, provision has been made for stable and satisfactory relationship between agricultural land owners and bargaders and the expression “immoveable property” cannot be said to be unambiguous and there is a doubt as to whether in dealing with agricultural land, the legislative authority at all intended to bring non-agricultural land within the mischief of section 5 of the Ordinance and as such, the impugned judgment should be set aside. <br/> <br/>Mr. Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of respondent No.1 in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.2080 of 2010 and Mr. Mahbubey Alam, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of respondent No.1 in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.2081 of 2010, on the other hand, support the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Senior Advocate, perused the impugned judgment and the materials on record.<br/> <br/>Benami transactions which have been in vogue in the Indian Sub-Continent for centuries denote a transaction which is done by a person without using his own name, but in the name of another. Acquiring and holding property and even carrying on business in names other than those of real owners or in fictitious names did not contravene any provision of law and therefore, Courts had given effect to such transactions. In benami transaction, the Benamdar has no beneficial interest in the property or business that stands in his name. He only represents the real owner as his trustee. In benami transactions, the presumption is that a person who pays money is the real owner and not the person in whose name the property is purchased. Earlier men purchased properties in benami to cajole or shield themselves against the creditors. There was also the need for defrauding by making secret transactions. Fear of confiscation also led to benami holdings. Besides, these arrangements were aimed at evading the law.<br/> <br/>This old age practice was given a go-by by section 5 of the Land Reforms Ordinance,1984. Before addressing the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner, it is necessary to go through the provision of section 5 as incorporated in Chapter-3 of the Ordinance under the caption “Prohibition of Benami Transaction of Immoveable Property” as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“5.(1) No person shall purchase any immovable property for his own benefit in the name of another person.<br/> (2) Where the owner of any immovable property transfers or bequeaths it by a registered deed, it shall be presumed that he has disposed of his beneficial interest therein as specified in the deed and the transferee or legatee shall be deemed to hold the property for his own benefit, and no evidence, oral or documentary, to show that the owner did not intend to dispose of his beneficial interest therein or that the transferee or legatee hold the property for the benefit of the owner, shall be admissible in any proceeding before any Court or authority.<br/> (3) Where any immoveable property is transferred to a person by a registered deed, it shall be presumed that such person has acquired the property for his own benefit, and where consideration for such transfer is paid or provided by another person it shall be presumed that such other person intended to pay or provide such consideration for the benefit of the transferee, and no evidence, oral or documentary, to show that the transferee hold the property for the benefit of any other person or for the benefit of the person paying or providing the consideration shall be admissible in any proceeding before any Court or authority.” </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The expression “immoveable property” is to be construed in its proper context to ascertain whether the expression is clear and unambiguous. In order to construe “immoveable property” as mentioned in section 5 of the Ordinance, all the sections of the Ordinance are to be considered. The expression immoveable property cannot be considered in isolation in the context of section 5 of the Ordinance. For proper construction, the preamble and the short title of the Ordinance are also to be considered. The preamble of the Ordinance runs as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“Whereas it is expedient to reform the law relating to land tenure, land holding and land transfer with a view to maximising production and ensuring a better relationship between land owners and bargadars.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>If the preamble is considered in isolation, then the submission made by Mr. Mahmudul Islam carries much force. Now let us see what role is played by the preamble in construing a statue. <br/> <br/>According to <strong><em>Maxwell</em></strong> “when possible, a construction should be adopted which will facilitate the smooth working of the scheme of the legislation”-<strong><em>Interpretation of Statutes</em></strong> 12<sup>th</sup> edition at page 201.<br/> <br/>In the case of <strong><em>Attorney General vs. H.R. H. Prince Earnest Gugustus of Hanover (1957) All E.R. Pg.49, Law Lord Viscount Simonds </em></strong>observed that as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“For words, and particularly general words, cannot be read in isolation; their colour and content are derived from their context. So it is that I conceive it to be my right and duty to examine every word of a statute in its context, and I use context in its widest sense which I have already indicated as including not only other enacting provisions of the same statute, but its preamble, the existing state of the law, other statutes in pari materia, and the mischief which I can, by those and other legitimate means, discern that the statute was intended to remedy.”<br/> <br/>On the one hand, the proposition can be accepted that<br/> <br/>“.......it is a settled rule that the preamble cannot be made use of to control the enactments themselves where they are expressed in clear and unambiguous terms.”<br/> <br/>“I quote the words of <strong><em>CHITTY,L.J.,</em></strong> which were cordially approved by <strong><em>Lord Davey in Powell V. Kempton Park Racecourse Co., Ltd(1)([1899] A.C 143 at p.185).</em></strong> On the other hand, it must often be difficult to say that any terms are clear and unambiguous until they have been studied in their context. That is not to say that the warning is to be disregarded against creating or imagining an ambiguity in order to bring in the aid of the preamble. It means only that the elementary rule must be observed that no one should profess to understand any part of a statue or of any other document before he has read the whole of it. Until he has done so, he is not entitled to say that it, or any part of it, is clear and unambiguous.”   <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the case of <strong><em>Amin Jute Mills Vs. Bangladesh 29 DLR(SC)85,</em></strong> it has been observed paragraphs 9 and 11 as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“It is now well-recognized, in this regard that although there was previously some difference of opinion among the distinguished jurists in England, the long title of an Act which is set out at its head giving the general purpose of the Act as well as the preamble of an Act which also recites the main object of the Act are part of the Act. One of the basic rules of interpretation of a statute is that to understand the meaning of a particular provision of an Act one is to read the Act as a whole each part shedding light on the other and the following observation of Lord Wright in the case of <strong><em>Jennings Vs. Kelly decided by the House of Lords and reported in 1940 A.C. 206 same case (1939) All. E.R. 464</em></strong> may be referred in this connection.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"> “The proper course is to apply the broad general rule of construction, which is that section or enactment must be construed as a whole, each portion throwing light, if need be, on the rest.”<br/> <br/>“..............If the words of a substantive provision of an Act are precise and unambiguous then the meaning thereof should not be restricted and controlled by taking recourse to the title or preamble of the Act. Lord Halsbury, L.C. in his speech in the case of Powell Vs. The Kempton Park Race Course Company Limited (1899) A.C. 143 at page 157 clearly stated the law in this regard in the following words;<br/> <br/>“Two propositions are quite clear-one that a preamble may afford useful light as to what a statute intends to reach, and another that, if an enactment is itself clear and unambiguous, no preamble can qualify or cut down the enactment.” <br/> <br/>Lord Davey dwelt on this question further in his separate speech in the same case and made the following observation at page 185 of the Report:<br/> <br/>“undoubtedly’....I quote from Chitty L.J.’s Judgment words with which I cordially agree...it is a settled Rule that the preamble cannot be made use of to control the enactments themselves where they are expressed in clear and unambiguous terms.........There is however another Rule or warning which cannot be too often repeated, that you must not create or imagine an ambiguity in order to bring in the aid of the preamble or recital. To do so would in many cases frustrate the enactment and defeat the general intention of the Legislature.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of <strong><em>Anwar Hossain Chowdhury Vs. the Government of Bangladesh, 41 DLR (AD)165,</em></strong> this Division in paragraph 489 of the report quoted with approval the observation of the Indian Supreme Court in the case of <strong><em>Sreemoti Indira Gandhi Vs. Rajnarain reported in AIR 1975 (SC)2299</em></strong> as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“The preamble, though a part of the Constitution is neither a source of power nor a limitation upon that of the ideological aspirations of the peoples…”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From the cases cited above, it appears that the preamble cannot control the meaning and expression when the meaning of the expression is clear and ambiguous. The aid of the preamble can be taken if the meanings of the words to be interpreted are not clear and ambiguous.   <br/> <br/>Having gone through the preamble, we find that the preliminary object of the legislative authority is to bring about reformation of the lands in rural area. The preamble must be read with sub-section (1) of section 1 which provides that this Ordinance may be called the Land Reforms Ordinance, 1984. The legislative authority was conscious in not using the word “agriculture” before Land Reform Ordinance. What is important to note here is that the word “land” has not been defined in section 2 of the Ordinance. But in clause-(c) of section 2 ‘barga land’ has been defined. Had the legislative authority the intention to deal with agricultural land only, it would not have defined “barga land”.<br/> <br/>Sub-section (1) of section 5 of the Ordinance provides that no person shall purchase any immoveable property for his own benefit in the name of another person. Sub-section (2) of section 5 of the Ordinance provides that where the owner of any immoveable property transfers or bequeaths it by a registered deed, the presumption would be that he has disposed of his beneficial interest therein and the transferee or legatee shall be deemed to hold the property for his own benefit and that no evidence either oral or documentary to show that the seller did not intend to dispose of his beneficial interest therein or the transferee or legatee holds the property for the benefit of the owner and that such evidence shall not be admissible in any proceeding before any Court or authority. Sub-section (3) of section 5 provides that where any immovable property is transferred to a person by a registered deed, it shall be presumed that such person has acquired the property for his own benefit and no oral and documentary evidence to show that the transferee holds the property for the benefit of another person paying or providing the consideration shall be admissible in any proceeding before any Court or authority.<br/> <br/>The language of section 5 of the Ordinance is plain and unambiguous and it is remarkable by itself. This section must be read in conjunction with sub-section (1) of section 1 of the Ordinance, which provides that this Ordinance may be called the “Land Reforms Ordinance.” While describing the (naming) Ordinance, the legislative authority was conscious in not using the word “agriculture” before the word, ‘land’. This Ordinance has been divided into six chapters. Chapter-1 containing sections 1 to 3 relates to preliminary; chapter-II containing section 4 relates to limitation on acquisition of agricultural land; chapter-III comprising section 5 relates to prohibition of benami transaction of immoveable property; chapter-IV comprising sections 6 and 7 relates to homesteads in ‘rural area’, chapter-V consisting of sections 8-18 relates to agricultural land and resolution of dispute between the land owners and bargadars and chapter-VI containing sections 20, 21 and 22 relates to miscellaneous. Having gone through all the sections of the Ordinance, in general, and section 5, in particular, we are of the view that there is no scope for reading the words ‘rural area’ in section 5 of the Ordinance. From the cases cited before, it appears that the preamble cannot be used to control the enactments themselves where they are expressed in clear and unambiguous terms.  The aid of preamble can only be taken when the meanings of the words to be interpreted are not clear and unambiguous. Therefore, the words ‘immoveable property’ occurring in section 5 of the Ordinance include both agricultural and non-agricultural properties. There is no scope for encroaching upon the domain of legislature by importing the words ‘rural area’ in section 5 and addition of such words will amount to legislation by the judiciary which is not at all permissible.<br/> <br/>The Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of <strong><em>Md. Ismail Vs. the State, 21 DLR (SC)161 observed in paragraph 15</em></strong> that the function of the Court is interpretation, not legislation in the following terms:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“15. The purpose of the construction or interpretation of a statutory provision is no doubt to ascertain the true intention of the Legislature, yet that intention has, of necessity, to be gathered from the words used by the Legislature itself. If those words are so clear and unmistakable that they cannot be given any meaning other than that which they carry in their ordinary grammatical sense, then the Courts are not concerned with the consequences of the interpretation however drastic inconvenient the result, for, the function of the Courts is interpretation, not legislation.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The Indian Supreme Court in the case of <strong><em>Commissioner of Income Tax, Kerala Vs. Tara Agencies</em></strong> reported in (2007)6 Supreme Court Cases 429 held in paragraph 58 of the report (P.447) as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“58. <strong><em>In Union of India Vs. Deoki Nandan Aggarwal,</em></strong> a three Judge Bench of this Court held that it is not the duty of the Court either to enlarge the scope of legislation or the intention of the legislature, when the language of the provision is plain. The Court cannot rewrite the legislation for the reason that it had no power to legislate. The power to legislate has not been conferred on the courts. The Court cannot add words to a statute or read words into it which are not there.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From the cases cited above, it appears that the function of the Courts is interpretation, not legislation and that Courts cannot add words to a statute or read words into it which are not there.<br/> <br/>Before promulgation of this Ordinance, the benami transactions were prevalent both in rural, urban or municipal areas. It was the intention of the legislative authority that the system, if prohibited, would be prohibited both in rural and urban or municipal areas. Though most of the provisions of the Ordinance relate to rural areas, that will not alter the meaning of the provisions of section 5 which cannot be restricted to rural areas only.<br/> <br/>Because of benami transactions, multifarious litigations crop up across the country. Moreover, the persons having the possession of black money take advantage of benami transactions by purchasing property in the names of their nearest relatives and such transactions increase corruption in the society. So, the legislative authority had the intention to say good-bye to benami transactions once and for all.<br/> <br/>Benami transactions have been prohibited in India by the Benami Transactions (Prohibition and the Right of Recovery Property) Ordinance,1988 followed by the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act,1988 and therefore, in India benami transactions are not permissible both in rural and urban areas. We, however, got rid of benami transactions by the Land Reforms Ordinance,1984.<br/> <br/>The findings arrived at and the decision made by the High Court Division are based on proper appreciation of law and fact.<br/> <br/>In the light of the findings made before, we do not find any substance in these civil petitions for leave to appeal. Accordingly, both the petitions are dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

He is alleged to have issued four cheques for Tk. 80,69,500/-in favour of the informant, Abu Bashar, which were dishonoured. The informant lodged a First Information Report (F.I.R.) at Ramna Police Station on 27/03/2001. After investigation, the police submitted charge sheet against the accused, who upon arrest prayed for bail in Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 1569 of 2001 before the Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Dhaka who granted bail to him on 24.05.2001 till submission of charge sheet. After submission of charge sheet, the case records were sent to the court of Senior Metropolitan Sessions Judge for trial, where Special Case No. 2 of 2002 was registered and the Special Judge granted bail to the respondent on 6.2.2002 and fixed the case for hearing of cognisance. In the meantime, sanction was granted for trial of the respondent. On the date fixed, the respondent did not appear before the Special Tribunal on the ground of his illness and remained absent. Thereafter, without surrendering to the trial court, he filed an application under section 241A of the Code of Criminal Procedure for discharging him from the case on the ground that the criminal case which was started against him was not maintainable. The application was rejected and the learned Special Judge cancelled the bail of the respondent and issued a warrant for his arrest. The respondent, thereafter, moved the High Court Division under sections 435 and 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, without surrendering before the trial court. The High Court Division issued Rule and on the same date granted ad interim bail and stayed all further proceedings of the Metropolitan Special Case No. 2 of 2002.<br/> <br/>The State, being aggrieved, filed Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 76 of 2003 before this Division. Leave was granted to consider whether the High Court Division erred in law in granting bail to the petitioner and staying further proceedings of the special case pending for trial, when the respondent did not surrender before the trial court in compliance with its order dated 8.3.2003 and filed the revisional application as a fugitive before the High Court Division, which is incompetent according to settled principles of law. At the same time, this Division directed the Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Dhaka to immediately secure arrest of the respondent Dr. Fazlur Rahman in connection with the Metropolitan Special Case No. 2 of 2002 arising out of Ramna P.S. Case No. 70 dated 27.3.2001.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Sohrawardi, learned Deputy Attorney General submitted that it is a settled principle of law that a fugitive from justice cannot get the protection of law. He pointed out that the respondent did not surrender to the trial court after his bail was cancelled and warrant of arrest issued. He moved the High Court Division without surrendering there, and, therefore, the revisional petition ought not to have been entertained nor the Rule issued. He submitted that even the swearing of the affidavit was illegal. He pointed out that the revisional petition filed before the High Court Division shows that the respondent did not appear before the Commissioner of Affidavits and the cause title of the petition does not state that the petitioner was in custody, or was on bail, or appeared in person before the High Court Division. The learned D.A.G. submitted that the issuance of the Rule was illegal as was the grant of bail, which was cancelled by this Division and warrant of arrest was directed to be issued.<br/> <br/>The learned advocate on record appearing on behalf of the respondent made submissions supporting the order of the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned advocates and perused the impugned order as well as other materials placed before us. It is apparent from the revisional application filed by the respondent before the High Court Division that his bail was cancelled by the trial court and direction was issued for his warrant of arrest. The cause title of the revisional application does not indicate whether the respondent was on bail or in custody or present before the High Court Division. The affidavit of the revisional application was sworn by a Tadbirkar. There is nothing on record to suggest that the petitioner of the revisional application was present before the High Court Division when his application was considered or that having accepted his personal appearance bail was granted.<br/> <br/>It is by now a well-established principle of law that an accused person who avoids the process of any court is a fugitive from justice and cannot seek justice without surrendering before a court of law.<br/> <br/>In this regard we may refer to the decision in<strong> Anti-corruption Commission and others vs.</strong> <strong>Mahmud Hossain and others, </strong>61 DLR (2009) 17, where Mohammad Fazlul Karim, J. (as his lordship then was) observed as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong>“Cardinal principle of the criminal jur-isprudence is that the person concerned should submit to the process of justice </strong><strong>before he can claim the right of audience</strong><strong> provided in law as well as the judicial </strong><strong>convention, which is very much effective</strong><strong> in the Court of law. Enunciating the age old maxim that a man who seeks justice from the Court of law must come before the Court to agitate his grievance and must surrender first to the process of justice, otherwise he remains to be fugitive from justice and could not seek aid or assistant of the process of justice in order to claim right of audience against the process of the court issued against him.”</strong><br/><br/><strong>“In the instant case, the petitioner having not surrendered to the process of the Court could not file any application or put his grievance before a Court of law far less before the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. In the absence of any surrender before the process of law, the Court of law is incompetent to issue any order or stay any process at its behest and if done so that would be illegal and without jurisdiction.”</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the facts of the instant case, it appears that the respondent was neither in custody nor appeared in person when his revisional application was moved. Clearly the High Court Division ought not to have considered his petition as he was undoubtedly a fugitive from justice. Hence, the question of issuing any Rule did not arise.<br/><br/>In the facts and circumstances, we are of the view that the respondent was a fugitive from justice and still remains so in spite of the fact that this Division issued directions to secure his arrest, he remains still at large. Until his surrender, no court of law can give him any protection or entertain any application by him.<br/>This appeal is, accordingly, allowed and the impugned Order of the High Court Division in Criminal Revision No. 227 of 2003 including the issuance of Rule, granting of ad interim bail and staying further proceedings of Metropolitan Special Case No. 2 of 2002 which arose out of Ramna Police Station Case No. 70 dated 27.03.2001 now pending in the Court of Metropolitan Sessions Judge and Special Judge, Dhaka is hereby, set aside.<br/><br/>         Let a copy of this judgement and order be communicated at once to the Court concerned. Upon receipt of a copy of this judgement and order, the Metropolitan Sessions Judge and Senior Special Judge, Dhaka is directed to proceed with the trial of the respondent Dr. Fazlur Rahman in accordance with law.<br/><br/><strong>         Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Within that period he collected rents from the tenants by granting rent receipts. But showing less collection he misappropriated Tk. 77,978/25 paisa within that period. On this allegation the local Anti Corruption Bureau inquired into the matter and verifying the correctness of misappropriation lodged First Information Report at Kushtia Police Station and they took up the investigation.<br/> <br/>After investigation charge sheet was submitted under Section 409 of the Penal Code read with Section 5 (2) of the prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.<br/> <br/>During trial the case record was transmitted to the Divisional Special Judge, Khulna for trial. The learned Judge of the said Court framed charge against the accused appellant under Section 409 of the Penal Code read with Section 5 (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. The charge was read over to the accused to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/> <br/>The learned Divisional Special Judge took evidence and at one stage found that the charge framed was defective since the three years’ period of defalcation had been charged in one charge. Then he amended the charge by dividing the period into three and resumed the trial and convicted the appellant under section 409 of the Penal Code and sentenced him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one year for each particular period.  <br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and order of conviction and sentence the accused preferred Criminal Appeal No. 2907 of 1999 before the High Court Division, which upon hearing allowed the appeal and acquitted the appellant. <br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by the said judgement and order of the High Court Division a petition for leave to appeal was filed by the State and leave was granted to consider whether the acquittal of the accused by the High Court Division without considering the amended provision, namely Section 6(1B) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 which allows trial of an accused in respect of more offences than one in one trial for all such offences, has resulted in miscarriage of justice.<br/> <br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General, Mr. Biswajit Deb Nath appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that Section 6 (1B) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, allows trial of an accused in respect of more offences than one in one trial for all such offences and, therefore, the charge framed at the outset on 02.10.1997 was correctly done in accordance with the Criminal Law Amendment Act. He further submitted that splitting up of the charge by the trial Judge has not caused any prejudice to the accused-respondent. He finally submitted that in any event, even if there is any technical defect in framing the charge, that cannot result in acquittal of the accused, who being a Government official has committed very serious offence by misappropriating funds abusing his official position.<br/> <br/>Learned Advocate Mr. Sheikder Mokbul Hoque appearing on behalf of the respondent made submissions in support of the impugned judgement. He submitted that in similar cases where a defect of charge was found the High Court Division has acquitted the accused person on the ground that such defect in the charge is not curable under Section 537 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (the Code). In this regard he has referred to 4 decisions in the cases of <strong><em>Md. Abdul Bari Molla Vs. The state reported in 17 BLD (1997)223, Md. Nizamuddin Dhali Vs the State reported in 16 BLD (1996) 581, </em></strong><strong><em>Abdur Razzak alias Geda Vs. The State reported</em></strong><strong><em> in 16 BLD (1996) 312 and Abul Kalam Azad vs. State reported in 48 DLR, 294. </em></strong><br/> <br/>Mr. Khurshid Alam Khan, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the Anti Corruption Commission (A.C.C.) made submissions similar to the learned Deputy Attorney General.  <br/> <br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Deputy Attorney General for the appellant and submissions of the learned Advocates appearing on behalf of the respective parties. We should point out at the outset that wrong framing of charge, although an important aspect of criminal trial cannot lead to acquittal of the accused merely on the ground of technical defect. Section 227 of the Code provides as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong>“<em>Court may alter charge.-(1) Any Court</em></strong><strong><em> may alter or add to any charge at any time before judgement is pronounced. </em></strong><br/><strong><em>(2) Every such alteration or addition shall be read and explained to the accused.” </em></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The requirement of law is therefore that if and when charge is altered or added at any time before judgement is pronounced, the alteration or addition must be read and explained to the accused. In the instant case it transpires from the order sheet that on 17.11.1999 the prosecution filed an application for splitting the charge since the offences took place over a period more than one year. Keeping in view the provision of Section 222(2) and 234 (1) of the Code the charge was split into three, each covering a period of less than one year. After recasting the charge it was read and explained to the accused who pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. On the same date a further witness was examined on behalf of the prosecution and the accused was examined under Section 342 of the Code when he again claimed to be innocent and expressed his intention to call defence witnesses. Date was fixed for 23.11.1999 for defence witness, but no summons could be issued for defence witness as no list had been supplied. A list of defnece witness was supplied on 21.11.1999. However, an application to issue summons was rejected since the learned Advocate for the accused had stated on 17.11.1999 that the list of witnesses was ready and that he would file it on that date but he did not do so.<br/> <br/>Section 228 of the Code is also relevant in the present context, which provides as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong>“<em>When trial may proceed immediately after alteration.-If the charge framed or alteration or addition made under section 227 is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is not likely, in the opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused in his defence or the prosecutor in the conduct of the case, the Court may, in its discretion, after such charge or alteration, or addition has been framed or made, proceed with the trial as if the new or altered charge had been the original charge.”  </em>    </strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The Court therefore can proceed with the trial even on the day of amending the charge or adding any new charge if it would not prejudice the accused in his defence. Section 231 of the Code provides that:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong><em>“Re-call of witnesses when charge altered.-Whenever a charge is altered or added to by the Court after the commencement of the trial, the prosecutor and the accused shall be allowed to re-call or re-summon, and examine with reference to such alteration or addition, any witness who may have been examined and also to call any further witness whom the Court may think to be material.”</em></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the memo of appeal before the High Court Division the accused took a ground that “when the accused appellant prayed for further cross-examination of the witnesses so adduced in court on the basis of new framed charge the learned Special Judge with <em>mala fide</em> intention arbitrarily disallowed the prayer and thereby the accused-appellant was denied justice.” It appears therefore that there was no allegation of failure of the trial Judge to allow the accused to call defence witnesses. Moreover, the accused could have immediately challenged the rejection of his application to call defence witnesses, but did not do so.<br/> <br/>It is also apparent that the accused did not challenge the splitting of the charge.<br/> <br/>The accused was alleged to have defalcated various sums of money on dates between 21.12.1987 to 20.12.1991. It is true that under the Code each charge ought to have been for no more than one year. To that extent it would have been proper at the initial stage to frame three charges each for a period of one year. That would have satisfied the requirement of the Code. However, in the facts and circumstances of the instant case it is clear that the offence is listed in the schedule of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 therefore triable and punishable under the provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act. <br/> <br/>Section 6 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act provides that the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure; 1898, shall in so far they are not inconsistent with this Act apply to the proceedings of the Court of a Special Judge.<br/>And section 6 (1B) provides as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<strong><em>A person accused of more offences than one punishable under this Act, may be tried at </em></strong><strong><em>one trial for all such offences.”</em></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The provisions of Section 222(2) read with Section 234 (1) require that if there are more than one offences committed over a period of more than 12 months then the offences may not be charged in one charge, whereas Section 6 (1B) provides that any number of offences punishable under the Criminal Law Amendment Act irrespective of the period over which the offence was committed, may be tried at one trial. Clearly, therefore, the provision in the Criminal Law Amendment Act is not consistent with the provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure thereby ousting the applic-ability of the provisions of the Code in proceedings before the Court of Special Judge. Hence, all the offences committed over any length of period of time could be tried in one trial upon framing one charge.<br/> <br/>In the facts of the instant case it appears that in fact the accused was prejudiced by framing three charges, one for each 12 months’ period, and he was ultimately convicted three times and given three separate sentences, although ordered to run concurrently.<br/> <br/>Since Section 409 of the Penal Code read with Section 5(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act come within the schedule of Criminal Law Amendment Act, the offences are liable to be tried as per the provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, which being special law will prevail over the general law, i.e. the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/> <br/>In any event, as has been pointed out earlier, defect in framing of charge cannot be a ground for acquittal of the accused. The only time when any proceeding can be quashed for material error in the framing of charge is when the Court forms the opinion that the facts of the case are such that no valid charge could be framed against the accused in respect of the facts proved. Section 232 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that even where an accused convicted of an offence was misled in his defence by absence of a charge or by an error in the charge, the Appellate Court or the Revisional Court shall direct a new trial to be held upon a charge framed in whatever manner it thinks fit. Thus, if ingredients of an offence are disclosed the charge may be altered at any time or a new charge may be framed at any time up to the pronouncement of judgement, giving opportunity to the accused to put in his defence against the new or altered charge. But in no way can he be acquitted if the evidence against him proved his guilt in commission of an offence.<br/> <br/>The cases referred by the learned Advocate for the respondent were all cases where Section 6 (1B) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act was not considered and, therefore, those cases are of no relevance in the facts and circumstances of the instant case.  <br/> <br/>We find from the record that the accused has paid back all the money which he is alleged to have defalcated. That again cannot be a ground for acquittal, if it is found from evidence that he in fact committed the offence. Upon conviction, it is the discretion of the Court to award punishment in accordance with law and taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case, including any mitigating circumstances. To that extent the period of sentence may be more or less depending on the facts of the case and the circumstances of the accused.<br/> <br/>In view of the above discussion, we are of the opinion that the judgement and order of the High Court Division being erroneous, having been passed without considering the relevant laws, is liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the impugned judgement and order is set aside. However, we are of the view that the ends of justice will be sufficiently met if the sentence of imprisonment of the accused respondent before us is reduced to the period already undergone by him.<br/> <br/>In the result the appeal is allowed with the modification of sentence as aforesaid.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>
