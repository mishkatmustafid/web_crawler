S.I. Sadequl Islam (PW. 8) received a secret information to the that some inter-gang dacoits assembled in the village home of accused Abdul Azid alias Azid dacoit at village Chalk Kabiraji within Kamalgonj Police Station. Later, he along other Police personnel namely PSI Sirajuddin (PW.1), PSI Abdul Jabber(PW.4), A.S.I. Md. Yusuf Ali(PW. 2), A.S.I. Md. Farhad Hossain (PW.3), A.S.I. Shahalam, A.S.I Jamaluddin, and C-Abdur Rashid rushed there. Sensing their presence all the accused tried to fly away. Of them, accused Abdul Azid, Akmol Hossain, Sabuj Miah and Kador Ali were nabbed by them with one country made two bore gun along with four bullets and two ramdao. He (PW.8) also seized different house hold articles from there and prepared seizure list in presence of locals namely Md. Shahjahan (PW.5), Machim Ali (PW. 6). Thereafter he handed over the accused with seized articles to the Komolgonj Police Station. The prosecution was launched by lodging a first information report by PW. 8 Md. Sadequl Islam, as informant which was recorded as Komolgonj P.S. Case no. 09 dated 23-01-2007.<br/>The Police after investigation submitted charge-sheet accusing the appellants as accused.<br/><br/>Eventually, the appellants were called upon to answer the charge under Sections 19A and 19(f) of the Arms Act to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/><br/>In course of trial the prosecution in all examined nine witnesses. The defence examined none.<br/><br/>After closure of the prosecution case the accused on dock were examined under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure again they repeated their innocence and led no evidence in defence.<br/><br/>The defence as it appears from trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses are that of innocence and false implication.<br/><br/>After trial the accused were convicted as aforesaid.<br/><br/>The learned Advocates appearing for the convict-appellants support the appeal. Their common contentions are that the alleged incriminating arms were not recovered from the exclusive control and possession of the appellants. They submit that the charge as framed against the appellants are not consistent with the prosecution case. Moreso, they are in custody since 22-01-2007 for about more than seven years. They lastly submit that they have been languishing in custody since 22-01-2007 so their sentence may be reduced.<br/><br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the State-respondent opposes the appeal and submits that the learned Judge after considering the materials on record and consistent evidence convicted the appellants which calls for no interference by this Court.<br/><br/>In order to appreciate their submissions we have gone through the record and given our anxious consideration to their submissions.<br/><br/>Now the question calls for consideration whether the incriminating seized arms were recovered from the exclusive control and possession of the appellants.<br/><br/>Let us now weigh and sift the evidence on record as adduced by the prosecution to prove the charge. P.W. 1 PSI Sirajuddin. He deposed that he was the informant at the time of recovery of the arms. On 22-01-2007 at 5:30 hrs. they rushed to the house of accused Azid and recovered one two bore gun along with four bullets. They also recovered two Chinese axe in presence of the witnesses. Then S.I. Sadequl Islam prepared seizure list and lodged the FIR.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that the seized arms were not examined by the ballistic expert. He denied the suggestion that after perfunctory investigation charge-sheet was submitted.<br/><br/>PW.2, ASI Md. Yusuf Ali, PW. 3 ASI Md. Farhad Hossain, PW.4 PSI Abdul Jabber, they were also with the informant at the time of raiding. They deposed that on 22-01-2007 on the basis of a secret information they along with the informant rushed to the house of accused Abdul Azid and arrested them with arms, they recovered one two bore gun from the accused Azid, one arrow from Sabuj and two ramdao from accused Kador and Akmol. Informant prepared seizure list in presence of locals and they were handed over the accused to the Police Station.<br/><br/>In cross-examination they denied the suggestion that the arms were recovered from the accused and they deposed falsely.<br/><br/>PW. 5 Md. Shahjahan and PW. 6 Md. Machim Ali were locals seizure list witnesses. They categorically stated that on 22-01-2007 at 5:30 hrs. the Police raided the house of Abdul Azid of village Chalk kabiraji and recovered one two bore gun, ramdao, rod and arrow from there and prepared seizure list. They also stood as witnesses in the seizure list. Of them PW. 5 Md. Shahjahan proved the seizure list as Exbt.1 and his signature on it 1/1.<br/><br/>In cross-examination they categorically stated that they had no knowledge what were noted in the seizure list and they denied the suggestion that they had no knowledge about the occurrence.<br/><br/>PW. 7 Sundar Ali, a local witness. He deposed that on 22-01-2007 at 5:30 p.m. Police raided the house of Abdul Azid at village Chalk Kabiraji and recovered one two bore gun, ramdao, and arrow and other house hold articles. He identified the accused on dock.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he admitted that there was an enmity between them since marriage of her daughter and being influenced he was deposing falsely.<br/><br/>PW. 8 S.I. Md. Sadequl Islam was the informant of the case. On 22-01-2007 he received a secret information that some inter-gang unknown dacoits were assembled in the house of Abdul Azid,  he along with other Police personnel rushed there, sensing their presence the accused tried to fly away but they succeeded to nab them and recovered different arms from them. He also prepared seizure list and handed over them to the Police Station. He lodged the FIR and proved it as Exbt. 2 and his signature on it 2/1.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that the arms were seized in presence of the witnesses  and he could not remember how many items were in the seizure list.  He denied the suggestion that he did not visit the P.O. and instituted the false case against the accused.<br/><br/>PW.9 S.I.  Md. Hadeyet Islam was the investigating officer of the case. He deposed that on 23-01-2007 he was attached with Komolgonj Police Station. The case was entrusted to him for investigation. He visited the place of occurrence, prepared sketch map and index (Exbts. 4 and 5 respectively).  He recorded the statements of the witnesses under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and after investigation submitted charge-sheet against the accused.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he denied the suggestion that no arms were recovered from the accused and after perfunctory investigation he submitted charge sheet and the accused were innocent.<br/><br/>These are all of the evidence on record adduced by the prosecution to prove the charge.<br/><br/>On going to the evidence on record it transpires that in course of trial the prosecution in all examined nine witnesses, of them PWs. 1, 2, 3 and 4 were the Police personnel and member of the raiding party, PW. 8 was the informant and PW. 9 was the investigating officer of this case. PW. 5,  PW. 6 and PW. 7 were local witnesses. Of them, PWs. 5 and 6 were the seizure list witnesses.<br/><br/>On appraisal of the evidence on record it transpires that the case is absolutely rest upon the evidence of Police personnel. The other witnesses namely PW. 5, PW-6 and PW. 7 were examined to corroborate the evidence of Police personnel. PW.8 is the informant who categorically stated that on 22-01-2007 he received a secret information that some inter-gang dacoits assembled in the village home of accused Azid. He along with other Police personnel rushed there at 5:30 p.m. they succeeded to arrest the accused persons with one two bore gun, along with ramdao, Chinese axe and arrow and other house hold articles. PW. 1, PW. 2, PW.3 and PW. 4 who were the member of the raiding party corroborated the evidence of PW-8 regarding recovery of the arms from the accused. Moreso PWs. 5, 6 and 7 are the local witnesses they corroborated the evidence of other Police personnel in respect of recovery of arms. PWs.5 and 6 stood as witnesses in the seizure list and they stated that the alleged arms were recovered in their presence.<br/><br/>It transpires that the evidence of all the prosecution witnesses in respect of recovery of the arms from the convict-appellants are consistent, uniform and corroborative with each other in respect of all materials particulars. There is absolutely no reason to disbelieve the consistent and corroborative evidence of those competent witnesses having no reason whatsoever to depose falsely against the appellants. The defence extensively cross-examined them but nothing could be elicited to shake their credibility in any manner whatsoever. So the same are invulnerable to the credibility.<br/><br/>Moreover, the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence in its entirety is well founded in the facts and circumstances of the case. So the submissions advanced by the learned Counsels for the appellants are not the correct exposition of law and facts. On the contrary the submissions advanced by the learned Deputy Attorney General prevails and appears to have a good deal of force. We have considered the humanitarian submissions of the learned Counsels for the defence to the effect that the convicts have been languishing in Jail for about seven years, so we are inclined to reduce their quantum of sentences.<br/><br/>In view of foregoing narrative the appeals are dismissed with modification of sentences to the effect that the appellants are convicted under Sections 19A and 19(f) of the Arms Act and each of them are sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for ten years.<br/><br/>In view of Provisions laid down in Section 35A (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure the total period the appellants have been in custody before conviction in connection with this offence shall be deducted from the sentence of imprisonment awarded to them.<br/><br/>         Office is directed to send down the record at once.<br/><br/>         <strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

In fact, the subsequent SRO was published in the official gazette on 05.11.1991.<br/><br/>The question raised in these appeals has been settled by this Division in the case of  <strong><em>Collector of Customs, Chittagong and others vs. Ahmed Hossain and 39 others (1996) 48 DLR (AD) 199</em></strong>, this Division held as under :<br/>It appears that the Parliament in the Finance Act 1995 added section 30A after section 30 which is as follows :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“30A. Value and effective rate of duty-Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or any decision of any court, for the purpose of section 30, the value and the rate of the duty applicable to any goods shall respectively include the value as determined under section 25 and any amount of duty imposed under sections 18, 18A and 18B and the amount of duty that may have become payable in consequence of the withdrawal of the whole or any part of the exemption or concession from duty whether before or after the conclusion of a contract or agreement for the sale of such goods or opening of a letter of credit in respect thereof.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">For the reasons aforesaid and in view of the change in the law as above, we do not find it necessary to grant leave.”   </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The principle expounded in the case of <strong><em>Bangladesh Vs. Mizanur Rahman (2000) 52 DLR (AD) 149</em></strong> is that the importer has to pay taxes and customs duties on the basis of tariff value in force on the date of presentation of bill of entry.<br/><br/>In the appeals before us, instead of tariff value, the duties and taxes were increased by a subsequent SRO before submissions of the bill of entry. The principle expressed in the case of the <strong><em>Government Vs. Mizanur Rahman (ibid)</em></strong> can be applied in the present appeals as Government has the power to increase the duties and taxes before submission of bill of entry.<br/><br/>In the light of the findings made before, we find substance in these appeals. Accordingly, the appeals are allowed and the impugned judgments are set aside. <br/><br/>Ed.<br/> </div></div></div>

No. 1602 of 2010 has arisen out of judgment and order dated 17.11.2009 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 389 of 2008 which was directed against the judgment and decree dated 13.09.2007 passed by the learned District Judge, Comilla in Money Appeal No. 2 of 2007 allowing the appeal and reversing the judgment and decree dated 13.11.2006 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 1st Court, Comilla in Money Suit No. 5 of 2003 decreeing the suit in part.<br/> <br/>C. P. No. 1603 of 2010 has arisen out of the judgment and order dated 17.11.2009 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 422 of 2008 which was directed against the judgment and decree dated 13.09.2007 passed by the learned District Judge, Comilla in Money Appeal No. 1 of 2007 allowing the appeal and reversing the judgment and decree dated 13.11.2006 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 1st Court, Comilla in Money Suit No. 4 of 2003 decreeing the suit in part.<br/> <br/>The relevant facts in respect of C. P. No. 1602 of 2010 are as follows:<br/>The present respondent No.1 as the plaintiff instituted Money Suit No.5 of 2003 against the defendants in the 1st Court of Joint District Judge, Comilla praying decree for realization of Tk. 5,19,258.00 from the defendants-petitioners. The plaintiffs' case, in short, is that the Chief Engineer, Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority (BEPZA) issued work order being No. BEPZA / CE-11-99 / 71 dated 12.02.2001 in his favour through tender procedures for development of the land of Kha Goup being eighteen industrial plots with construction of roads of Comilla EPZ (Export Processing Zone) fixing the date for completion of the work on 27.08.2001. As per tender schedule, formation level of earth was fixed at 04.00 metre height. Accordingly the plaintiff started earth work on 12.02.2001 in full speed under the supervision of defendant nos. 1 and 2 and was allowed to withdraw running bills of Tk. 85,77,895.22 in four installments. In the midst of work, the defendants verbally directed the plaintiff to reduce the formation level of earth from 4.00 metre to 3.50 metre height. For this, a considerable quantum of earth became surplus and the defendant no.6, on 21.05.2001 verbally asked the plaintiff to extend the said volume of work with the surplus earth to their chosen site and accordingly, the plaintiff started the modified work relying upon the verbal assurance of the defendant No.6 that written sanction for extension of time for completion of work would be commu-nicated later on. However, verbally the time for completion of the work was changed and extended up to 26.09.2001. As per measurement book (MB), the plaintiff-respondent No.1 completed the original Schedule work before 27.08.2001 and additional modified work within revised time schedule. After completion of work, the work value was assessed at Tk. 1,15,70,173.51 and after deduction of the amount withdrawn by current bills, Tk. 24,68,629.42 was payable to the plaintiff-respondent No.1 but the defendants arbitrarily allowed him to withdraw Tk. 21,60,577.91 deducting Tk. 3,73,396.94 from the actual dues as penalty on the plea of violation of contractual time limit for completion of work as per schedule. The plaintiff then submitted an application on 11.03.2002 to defendant no.6 for withd-rawal of the penalty arbitrarily imposed upon him but to no effect. Hence, the suit was filed for recovery of money amounting to total Tk. 5,19,258.00 being the deducted amount of Tk. 3,73,369.00 and compensation thereon at the rate of Bank interest amounting to Tk. 1,45,862.00.<br/> <br/>The relevant facts in respect of C.P. No.1603 of 2010 are stated below:<br/>The present respondent No.1 as the plaintiff instituted Money Suit No.4 of 2003 against the defendants in the 1st Court of Joint District Judge, Comilla praying for realization of Tk. 5,84,982.00 from the defendants-petitioners. The plaintiff's case, in short, is that the Chief Engineer, BEPZA issued work order being No.BEPZA / CE­-11 / 99 / 72 dated 12.02.2001 in his favour through tender procedures for development of land of 'Ga Group' eighteen industrial plots with construction of roads of Comilla EPZA fixing the date for completion of the work on 27.08.2001. As per tender schedu1e, formation level of earth was fixed at 4.00 metre height. Accordingly, the plaintiff started earth work on 12.02.2001 in full speed under the supervision of defendant nos.1 and 2 and was allowed to withdraw running bills of Tk. 97,35,875.61 in four installments. In the midst of work the defendant verbally directed the plaintiff to reduce the formation level of earth from 4.00 metre to 3.50 metre height. For this alternation, a considerable quantum of earth became surplus and the defendant no.6 on 21.05.2001 verbally asked the plaintiff to extend the side volume of work with the surplus earth to their chosen site and accordingly, the plaintiff started the modified work relying upon the verbal assurance of the defendant no.6 that the written sanction for extension of time for completion of the work would be communicated later on. However, time schedule for completion of work was verbally extended to 26.09.2001. In the measurement book (MB) maintained by the plaintiff-respondent it is noted that the plaintiff completed the original work as per tender schedule before 27.08.2001 and he also completed the additional modified work as per verbally revised schedule of time. But after deduction of the amount already withdrawn by current bills, the defendants allowed him to receive Tk. 29,66,688.91 deducting Tk. 4,21,083.66 as penalty charge on the plea of violation of contractual time limit for completion of work as per schedule. The plaintiff-respondent then submitted an application on 11.03.2002 to the defendant no.6 for withdrawal of the penalty arbitrarily imposed allowing him to have the money, but to no effect. Hence, the suit for recovery of money amounting to total Tk. 5,84,982.00 being the deducted amount of Tk. 4,21,083.66 and compensation thereon at the rate of bank interest amounting to Tk. 1,63,898.34.<br/> <br/>The present petitioner as defendant contested both the suits by filing joint written statements separately stating, interalia, that they admit that the work orders were issued to the plaintiff-respondent and the formation level of earth was changed from 4.00 metre to 3.50 metre height and the plaintiffs were asked to fill up adjoining areas of the work-site with the surplus earth within the same specified time. They denied the extension of time for completion of the work stating that since the subsequent instruction modifying original work order, did not increase the total volume of work, time was not necessary for rescheduling the tender work. Their further case was that the plaintiffs having failed to complete the work within specified time penalty was imposed upon them at the rate of 3% which was deducted from their submitted bills and that no verbal assurance of extending time of work was given to the plaintiff and that suit was liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/>The learned Joint District Judge, 1st Court, Comilla decreed the Money Suit No. 4 of 2003 in part for Tk. 4,21,083/- and Money Suit No. 5 of 2003 in part for Tk. 3,73,696.94 by separate judgments and decrees both dated 13.11.2006.<br/> <br/>The defendants-petitioners being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgments and decrees preferred Money Appeal No.1 of 2007 against the judgment and decree passed in Money Suit No.4 of 2003 and Money Appeal No.2 of 2007 against those passed in Money Suit No.5 of 2003. The learned District Judge, Comilla having heard both the appeals analogously disposed of the same by a single judgment and decree dated 13.09.2007 allowing the appeals.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and decree dated 13.09.2007 passed by the learned District Judge the plaintiff-respondent moved the High Court Division in revisional jurisdiction in Civil Revision Nos. 422 of 2008 and 389 of 2008 respectively and a Division Bench of the High Court Division by a single judgment and order dated 17.11.2009 made both the Rules absolute setting aside the judgments and decrees passed by the Court of appeal below. The defendant-petitioner being aggrieved by the impugned judgment and order dated 17.11.2009 passed by the High Court Division in aforesaid two civil revisions preferred the instant two Civil Petitions for Leave to Appeal before this Court.<br/> <br/>Mr. Bodruddoza, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioners in both the petitions submits that the High Court Division erred in law in passing the impugned judgment and order on the issue of the existence of Arbitration Clause and that these suits are not maintainable without exhausting the remedy available in the Arbitration Clause and that there being no illegality committed by the Court of appeal below, the judgment and decree passed by the court of appeal below deserves no interference by the High Court Division. He finally submits that without considering these legal aspects of the matter both the Rules were made absolute and hence the impugned judgments and orders passed by the High Court Division in both the Rules are liable to be set aside and leave should be granted.<br/> <br/>Mr. Khair Azaz Masud, the learned Advocate for the respondent No.1 submits that there is no illegality in the impugned judgment and order as such both the leave petitions are liable to be dismissed in limini.<br/> <br/>We have heard the learned Counsels appearing for both the parties, perused the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division and other materials available on record.<br/> <br/>In the instant case there is a provision for arbitration in Clause 25 of the contract of work which provides amongst others that all questions and disputes relating to the meaning of the specifications, designs, drawings and instruction and also as to the quality of workmanship or materials used on the work, or as to any other questions, claim, right, matter or thing whatsoever in any way arising out of or relating to the contract, designs drawings, specifications, estimates, instructions, orders or those conditions or otherwise concerning the work or the execution or failure to execute the same whether arising during the progress of the works or after the completion or abandonment thereof shall be referred to the tender accepting authority of BEPZA in the manner provided by law relating to arbitration for the time being in force who after such investigation as he may think proper shall deliver his award which shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties to the contract. Admittedly in the instant case arbitration shall be governed by the Arbitration Act, 2001. section 10 of the Arbitration Act, 2001 envisages power of the Court to stay illegal proceedings where there is an arbitration agreement between the parties to refer the Arbitration. It is pertinent to re-produce section 10 of the Arbitration Act which reads as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“10. Arbitrability of the dispute-<br/>Where any party to an arbitration agreement or any person claiming under him commences any legal proceedings against any other party to the agreement or any person claiming under him in respect of any matter agreed to be referred to arbitration, any party to such legal proceedings may, at any time before filing a written statement, apply to the Court before which the proceedings are pending to refer the matter to arbitration.<br/>Thereupon, the Court shall, if it is satisfied that an arbitration agreement exists, refer the parties to arbitration and stay the proceedings, unless the court finds that the arbitration agreem-ent is void, inoperative or is incapable of determination by arbitration.<br/>Notwithstanding that an application has been made under sub-section (1) and that the issue is pending before the judicial authority, arbitration may be commenced or continued and an arbitral award made.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the instant case it is noticed by the High Court Division that the defendants-petitioners by filing written statements contested the suit. They submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the Civil Court i.e. the trial court and thereby they failed to avail the opportunity of resorting to arbitration by seeking stay of the suit. In that view of the matter the High Court Division rightly observed as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“So none of the parties had intention to settle up the dispute through arbitration. It is also clear that section 10 of the Arbitration Act, 2001 does not operate as a bar against filing of the instant suit and the learned District Judge completely failed to take notice of this aspect of law. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the learned District Judge has committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice in holding that the suit was not maintaina-ble for not redressing the dispute through the arbitrator.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In coming to the aforesaid conclusion the High Court Division has rightly considered the decision in the case of State of U.P. -Vs- Janki Saran Kailash Chandra reported in AIR 1973 S.C. 2071 at page 2075, para 7 wherein the Supreme Court of India observed as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“When a party to an arbitration agreement commences any legal proceedings against any other party to the said agreement with respect to the subject matter thereof, then the other party is entitled to ask for such proceedings to be stayed so as to enable the arbitration agreement to be carried out. It is, however, to be clearly understood that the mere existence of an arbitration clause in an agreement does not by itself operate as a bar to a suit in the Court. It does not by itself impose any obligation on the Court to stay the suit or to give any opportunity to the defendant to consider the question of enforcing the arbitration agreement. The right to institute a suit in some Court is conferred, on a person having a grievance of a civil nature, under the general law. It is a fundamental principle of law that where there is a right there is a remedy. Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure confers this general right of suit on aggrieved person except where the cognizance of the suit is barred either expressly or impliedly. A party seeking to curtail this general right of suit has to discharge the onus of establishing his right to do so and the law curtailing such general right has to be strictly complied with. To enable a defendant to obtain an order staying the suit apart from other conditions mentioned in section 34 of the Arbitration Act, he is required to present his application praying for stay before filing his written statement or taking any other step in the suit proceedings. In the present case, the written statement was indisputably not filed before the applicat-ion for stay was presented. The question is whether any other step was taken in the proceeding as contemplated by section 34 and it is this point with which we are directly concerned in the present case. Taking other steps in the suit proceedings connotes the idea of doing something in aid of the progress of the suit or submitting to the jurisdiction of the Court for the purpose of adjudication of the merits of the controversy in the suit."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Popular Biscuit Limited -Vs- Beximco Bremer Export Cantor Brand reported in 4 ADC (2007) 743 this Division discussed the extent and scope of section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 and held to the effect that when parties to the suit submit themselves to the jurisdiction of the civil court, the dispute should not be referred to arbitration. At page 756, para 29 this Division observed as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The High Court Division while staying the proceedings of the trial court, did not at all take into consideration the two basic lawful aspects of the case i.e. the respondent nos. 3-6 took steps on several occasions to adjourn the case in the name of filing written statement and that the respon-dent nos. 1 and 2 backed out from the arbitration proceedings which was pending before the ICC Paris. So the judgment and order dated 15.05.2000 passed by the High Court Division in staying the suit can not be sustained.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In view of the provisions of section 10 of the Arbitration Act, 2001 and the principles enunciated by the Apex Courts of the Sub-Continent including this Court we are of the opinion that section 10 of the Arbitration Act enables either of the parties to the arbitration agreement “at any time before filing of written statement to apply to the Court before which the proceedings are pending to refer the matter to the arbitration" whereupon the Court having been "satisfied that an arbitration agreement exists refer the parties to the arbitration and stay the proceedings."<br/> <br/>While considering section 10 of the Arbitration Act, 2001 this Division in the case of Maico Jute and Bag Corporation -Vs- Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation and others reported in 8 MLR (AD) 4 proceeded to the effect that section 10 of the Arbitration Act, 2001 provides for reference of dispute for settlement by arbitration if there is any such clause in the contract agreement and in that event the court shall, if it is not found inoperative or incapable of such settlement, refer the dispute to the arbitrator for settlement and award and thereupon shall stay further proceedings of the suit. There is nothing wrong if the Court stays suo motu the further proceedings of the suit pursuant to an arbitral reference.<br/> <br/>We have already noticed that the defendant has submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the Civil Court by filing written statement and contested the suit and thereby they failed to avail the opportunity of resorting to the arbitration by seeking stay of the suit before the Civil Court.<br/> <br/>As regards admissibility of the photocopies of some documents of the tender file which were marked as Exhibits-l series, in the instant case the High Court Division elaborately discussed the relevant provisions of law as to the admissibility of documentary evidence. The photocopies of some documents of the tender file are secondary evidence. Admissibility of secondary evidence is regulated by section 63 of the Evidence Act, 1872. The High Court Division rightly noticed that admittedly the original tender documents are in the possession of the defendant-petitioner. Section 65 of the Evidence Act provides that secondary evidence may be given of the existence, condition or contents of a document when the original is shown or appears to be in possession or power of the person against whom the document is sought to be proved or of any person legally bound to produce it, or when the existence, condition or contents of the original have been proved to be admitted in writing by the person against whom it is proved or by his representative in interest.<br/> <br/>In the instant case it appears that the defendant-petitioner was directed by the Court to produce the same at the time of trial as per prayer of the plaintiff-respondent. Moreover, the defendant-petitioner has not challenged that Exbt.1 series were not the original photocopies of the originals or that those were not supplied by the defendant-petitioner to the plaintiff-respondent. In that view of the matter the High Court Division rightly held that:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“This being the position, it is crystal clear that as per section 65(a) of the Evidence Act, the documents marked as Ext.1 series are admissible in evidence and consequently, we are led to hold that the learned District Judge was wrong in his finding that those photocopies in Ext. 1 series were not admissible in evidence.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It appears that the High Court Division rightly found that the learned District Judge allowed the appeals on two technical grounds without entering into merit of the case and without reversing the findings of the trial court about the plaintiffs’ entitlement of decree in both the suits. It has also been rightly noticed by the High Court Division that admittedly in the midst of tender work, the plaintiffs of both the money suits were verbally directed by the defendants to reduce the formation level of earth from 4.00 metre to 3.50 metre height and no revised or fresh written work-order was issued to that effect. It has also been noticed that by this verbal work-order the period for completion of work was extended from 27.08.2001 to 26.09.2001 which has been conceded by the learned Advocate for the petitioners (BEPZA) before the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>Having considered the submissions advanced on behalf of the defendant-petitioner and the material evidence on record the High Court Division rightly observed as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“we find that the learned Joint District Judge rightly held that the plaintiffs were entitled to part decrees as no other condition was imposed in the works done. The learned Joint District Judge appears to have found, by referring to the admission of D. W. 1 Moniruzzaman who himself is defendant No.1 to the effect that the plaintiffs did their work as per approval, there was no scope to deduct compe-nsation from the bills of the plaintiffs at the rate 3%. This finding appears to be based on evidence. We also do not find any reason to realise compensation from the payable amount.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In view of the discussions made above, we find that the learned District Judge appears to have committed errors of law in his finding as regards the maintain-ability of the suits on the grounds that those were hit by arbitration clause referred to above and in­admissibility of the photocopies of note sheet of the tender file in evidence which resulted in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice and thus it calls for our interference. The Rules, therefore merit consideration.”<br/> <br/>In view of the above discussions and findings, we do not find any illegality in the impugned judgment and order dated 17.11.2009 passed by the High Court Division in both the Civil Revision No. 389 of 2008 and Civil Revision No. 422 of 2008 calling for no interference by this Court. In consideration thereof, we do not find any merit in these two leave petitions.<br/><br/>            Accordingly, these leave petitions are dismissed.<br/><br/>            <strong>Ed</strong>.</div></div></div>

Muzammel Hossain, J:</strong></u></span><br/><br/>This petition for leave to appeal under Article 103 of the Constitution of People’s Republic of Bangladesh is directed against the judgment and order dated 19.08.2008 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 3544 of 2005 discharging the Rule and affirming the judgment and order dated 10.05.2005 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 1st Court, Dhaka in Money Suit No.32 of 2004 rejecting the application under Order 7 Rule 11(a) and (d) read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 filed by the defendant-petitioner.<br/><br/>The present respondent as plaintiff filed Money Suit No. 32 of 2004 for realization of a sum of TK. 2,50,038,000/- as damages from the defendant-petitioner along with interest at the rate of 15% stating, interalia, that the plaintiff was appointed as “Lady Confidential Typist” vide Memo No. SE/1 dated 17.01.1985 with effect from 01.01.1985. After her appoin-tment, considering her performance in service she was upgraded twice in 1996 and 2001 to the post of Secretary and Co-ordination Officer respectively. Since 1986 the plaintiff was the sole permanent female employee of the defendant-company and from the begining she was the recipient of unwelcome attention from two employees of the defendant-company, namely Mr. Ezaz Ahmed Choudhury, the Head of Leaf, who at the time of occurrence, was the Area Manager (Leaf) of the Company and Mr. Golam Farook Khan who was the leaf Co-ordination and Export Manager at the time of filing the suit. The unwelcome attention included touching of her body, pulling of the hands by these two persons, unnecessarily patting her on the head, and suddenly embracing her from behind. Besides, the other overtures of Mr. Golam Farook Khan were particularly disturbing as he was more explicit, even to the extent of offering the plaintiff extra-marital personal relationship. Other than the harassment mentioned above, the plaintiff had been enjoying her work in the defendant-petitioner-company and found support in respectful and considerate dealings of the other employees, particularly Mr. Md. Shahjahan who was then the Leaf Accountant, Kushtia and Mr. Manzurul Haque who was then the Plant Manager of Kushtia GLT Plant of the defendant-company and the Supervisor of the plaintiff. Manzurul Haque gave her protection. The plaintiff on several occasions made verbal complaints to her immediate superior. The Head of the Leaf, Mr. Ezaz Ahmed Choudhury had ordered the plaintiff in the year 2000 to report to the Head Office in Dhaka for working directly under him as his assistant and the plaintiff worked there until 2001 then she returned to "her Kushtia Office as Co-ordination Officer. From then on the sexual overtures and hints became more pronounced in Mr. Golam Farook Khan’s dealings with the Plaintiff-respondent. Once, in 1988, when Mr. Ezaz Ahmad Choudhury was stationed in Kushtia as Area Manager (Leaf) who used to reside in the defendant-petitioner's 1st Floor of the transit flat / rest house within the plant premises, the plaintiff-respondent in course of her official duties, had to go to the rest house and on her way out the plaintiff-respondent sought permission to use the toilet of the rest house since the place was empty and no one had arrived yet. After opening the door of the toilet the plaintiff-respondent discovered Mr. Ezaz Ahmed Choudhury in a compromising position with a young married lady known to her and everyone else in the office. On 31.07.2003 i.e. a day later the plaintiff received a letter from- Mr. Quazi Mohammad Shahed, the Head of Human Resources, terminating the plaintiff-respondent's service with effect from 01.08.2003 i.e. the very next date. Due to such behaviour, the plaintiff-respondent filed the instant suit claiming damages against the defendant-petitioner-company for the tort committed by its employees at her work place by harassing her sexually and also for bullying her and though she had brought the matter to the notice of the Manager of the Company, yet no step was taken by him to stop such harassment and bullying rather she was terminated from her service.<br/><br/>The sole defendant-petitioner appeared in the suit and filed an application under Order 7 Rule 11(a) and (d) read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure for rejection of the plaint on the grounds, inter alia, that the word “defamation” falls within the purview of an action in person, but the plaintiff-respondent brought the case against the defendant-petitioner which was not personally liable for any alleged damages caused to her in the form of harassment and bullying in work place while she was in the employment of the respondent-company. The suit is not in the nature of a suit as contemplated in section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure,1908 and that the suit is barred by law. The plaintiff has no cause of action to file this suit against the defendant-company and as such the application is liable to be allowed. The plaint can be rejected at any stage of the suit and as such the prayer under Order 7 Rule 11(a) and (d) should be allowed and the plaint is liable to be rejected.<br/><br/>The application was heard by the learned Joint District Judge, 1st Court, Dhaka who after hearing both the parties by the order dated 10.05.2005 rejected the application filed by the present petitioner seeking rejection of the plaint.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and order dated 10.05.2005 the defendant-petitioner moved the High Court Division in Civil Revision No. 3544 of 2005 and a Division Bench of the High Court Division by the impugned judgment and order dated 19.08.2008 discharged the Rule.<br/><br/>The defendant-petitioner being aggrieved by the impugned judgment and order passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division moved the instant civil petition for leave to appeal before this Division.<br/><br/>Mrs. Sigma Huda, the learned Advocate appearing for the defendant-petitioner submits that the High Court Division erred in law in applying the doctrine of the Vicarious liability which can not be applied in deciding the cause of action of the instant suit in absence of two essential conditions of co-existence of the relationship of master and servant and the offence has not been committed in the course of employment as "in the course of employ-ment" means the acts done by the employees having been authorised by the employment which are very much related with the affairs of the employment. She then submits that the High Court Division committed error of law occasioning failure of justice in not considering that the defendant-petitioner will be vicariously liable for those acts committed by its employees only if it had authorised them to do for carrying on the business of the Company and that the offence as allegedly committed, is not in any way related with the business of the defendant-petitioner and as such the defendant-petitioner cannot be held liable for the wrongful act of the employees which is beyond the scope of service. She contends that the High Court Division as well as the 1st Court of  Joint District Judge, Dhaka failed to appreciate that no cause of action can lie against the defendant-petitioner even vicariously since after termination, the plaintiff-respondent having accepted all dues and benefits from the defendant-petitioner against such termination without any protest precludes the right of any additional claim at any subsequent stage.<br/><br/>We have heard the learned Counsel appearing for both the parties and perused the judgment and order of the High Court Division and other materials on record. It appears that in various paragraphs of the plaint particularly in paragraph Nos.6, 7, 10, 21 and 22 the plaintiff-respondent has stated about the sexual harassment and bullying caused to her by the employees of the defendant-petitioner and about her attempt by approaching the manag-ement of the defendant-petitioner to get rid of such harassment and bullying but instead, she was terminated from her service. According to Order 7 Rule 11(a) a plaint is liable to be rejected if it does not disclose a cause of action. In the case of Abul Khair –Vs- Pubali Bank, 53 DLR (AD) 62 this Division held that the Court while deciding an application for rejection of plant is not permitted to travel beyond the averments made in the plaint. In the instant case from a clear reading of the plaint it appears that the plaintiff-respondent has made allegations against the defendant-petitioner about its inaction to remedy the sexual harassment and bullying caused to her by its employees. Supreme Court of India while formulating guideline against sexual harassment at workplace in Vishaka &amp; others vs State of Rajasthan &amp; others, AIR 1997 SC 3011, defines sexual harassment as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">"sexual harassment includes such unw-elcome sexually determined behaviour (whether directly or by implication) as:</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;">physical contact and advances;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">a demand or request for sexual favours;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">sexually coloured remarks;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">showing pornography;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature."</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">High Court Division in the case of Bang-ladesh National Women Lawyers Association (BNWLA) vs. Bangladesh, 14 BLC (HCD) 694 at page 706 paragraph 61 defines sexual harassment as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"a. Unwelcome sexually determined behaviour (whether directly or by implication) as physical contact and advances;<br/>b. Attempts or efforts to establish physical relation having sexual implic-ation by the abuse of administrative, authoritative or professional powers;<br/>c. Sexually coloured verbal represen-tation;<br/>d. Demand or request for sexual favours;<br/>e. Showing pornography;<br/>f. Sexually coloured remark or gesture;<br/>g. Indecent gesture, teasing through abusive language, stalking, joking having sexual implication;<br/>h. Insult through letters, telephone calls, cell phone calls, SMS, pottering, notice, cartoon, writing on bench, chair, table, notice boards, walls of office, factory, classroom, washroom having           sexual implication;<br/>i. Taking still or video photographs for the purpose of     blackmailing and character assassination;<br/>j. Preventing participation in sports, cultural, organizational and academic activities on the ground of sex and / or for the purpose     of sexual harassment;<br/>k. Making love proposal and exerting pressure or posing threats in case of refusal to love proposal;<br/>l. Attempt to establish sexual relation by intimidation, deception or false assurance."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The original definition of tort that appeared in the well-known work on Law of Torts by Clerk and Lindsell ran as follows: "A tort may be described as a wrong independent of contract, for which the appropriate remedy is a common law action." Underhill amplifies this definition thus:</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">"A tort is an act or omission which is not authorised by law, and independently of contract infringes either-	<ol><li>some absolute right of another;</li><li>some qualified right of another causing damage; or</li></ol></li><li style="text-align: justify;">(c) some public right resulting in some substantial and particular damage to some person beyond that which is suffered by the         public generally;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">and gives rise to an action for damages at the suit of the injured party."</li></ol><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;">Sexual harassment in employment may be termed as any attention of a sexual nature in the context of work situation which has the effect of making a woman uncomfortable on the job, impeding her ability to do the work or interfering with her employment opportunities. Sexual harassment may on its extreme form take the shape of a direct demand for sexual compliance coupled with the threat of firing if the woman refuses.<br/><br/>Sexual harassment has a devastating effect on both the economic opportunities and the physical and emotional well-being of working woman. Victim suffers from insomnia, depression, nervousness, fear, feeling of powe-rlessness and other symptoms of psychological harm which sometimes lead to a complete emotional breakdown. In consequence of this emotional breakdown and sometimes indepe-ndently physical effects such as headache, loss of appetite, loss of weight, nausea and fatigue may occur. It hinders a woman's chances of economic prospects by reducing her perfor-mance at job. So sexual harassment definitely gives birth of a liability under the law of tort.<br/><br/>A person can be liable for tort as well and damages may be claimed against him for such wrong doing as well as against an organization or establishment if it fails to ensure the preve-ntion of sexual harassment and bullying to a woman, where she can work with honour and dignity and without being harassed or disturbed by her male boss or other male colleagues. In the plaint the plaintiff has categorically stated about the touching of her body, pulling her hands, unnecessarily patting her on the head, suddenly embracing her from behind besides the other overtures by Mr. Ezaz Ahmed, an employee of the defendant-petitioner. She also alleged overtures against Mr. Golam Farooq Khan, another employee of the petitioner-company disturbing her in a more explicit manner. From the statements made in paragraph No.21 of the plaint it appears that the plaintiff-respondent made written complaints to the Human Resources Manager and the Managing Director of the petitioner-company and the other authorities for the harassment caused to her who has a duty of care towards her. We are of the view that where the existence of the cause of action is required to be determined by adducing evidence, plaint cannot be rejected under Order 7 Rule 11. Whatever may be the allegations made by the plaintiff in the plaint, whether the employees of the defendant-company harassed her in the work place, or the plaintiff made written com-plaints to the management of the defendant-petitioner-company about the sexual harassment and bullying by the said employees of the defendant-petitioner-company and whether the defendant-petitioner-company took any step to remedy the grievances of the plaintiff-respondent, or the defendant-petitioner-company took steps to prevent or deter the commission of the acts of sexual harassment and bullying by its employees and whether the defendant-petitioner-company could be held responsible for such sexual harassment and bullying caused to the plaintiff-respondent are all questions of facts and can only be decided on the evidence to be adduced by the concerned parties in the trial of the case. Moreover, question of vicarious liability of the defendant-petitioner-company is also a question of fact to be proved by adducing evidence. Both the High Court Division and the Trial Court from clear reading of the plaint rightly found that the plaintiff has clearly stated the facts of the cause of action to bring the suit against the defendant. The power to reject a plaint should not be exercised hastily without affording opportunity to the plaintiff to cure the defect or to amend the plaint. A plaint cannot be rejected for defect of parties because such an exigency has not been contemplated under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Defect of parties can be cured by the plaintiff by impleading the concerned employees of the defendant company in the plaint. It is worth mentioning that in an application under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure a plaint shall be rejected in the following cases: (a) where it does not disclose a cause of action; (b) where the relief claimed is undervalued and the plaintiff on being required by the Court to correct the valuation within a time to be fixed by the Court fails to do so; (c) where the relief claimed is properly valued, but the plaint is written upon paper insufficiently stamped, and the plaintiff, on being required by the Court to supply the requisite stamp-paper within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to do so; (d) where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law.<br/><br/>From a clear reading of the plaint, judgments and orders passed by the High Court Division and the trial Court in the instant case it appears that both the High Court Division and the Trial Court have rightly observed that none of these four conditions is attracted in the instant case. The grounds raised by the defendant petitioner do not come within the provisions of Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In the instant case we have found that the plaintiff respondent has clearly made out a case. There is a proper cause of action and none of the four grounds for rejection of plaint is attracted. The points raised by the defendant petitioner has no merit because all these points can be decided only by adducing evidence at the time of trial of the case and for those reasons the plaint cannot be rejected under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/><br/>For the aforesaid findings and observat-ions the High Court Division rightly discharged the Rule. In view of the above findings and observations we do not find any merit in the leave petition.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the leave petition is dismissed.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

There has been no objection or allegation as to violation of the provisions of section 6 of the Act which are related to joint trial of child offender with adult accused. . . . (10)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Children Rules, 1976</strong><br/><strong>Rules 2 and 4</strong><br/><strong>Children Act (XXXIX of 1974)</strong><br/><strong>Section 7</strong><br/><strong>Children Rules 1976 (shortly Rules 1976) were</strong><strong> made by gazette notification (extraordinary) published on 11<sup>th</sup> March 1976 under provision of section 77 of the Act, 1974. In rules 3 and 4 no penal provisions have been inserted as to the consequence of non-compliance of the said provisions in the light of above discussion it can be said that when no penal provisions has been provided in section 7 of the Act, 1974 for the consequence of non-compliance of the provisions therein it is  to be treated as directory and not mandatory. Therefore, if there has been any non-compliance of the said provision of law such non compliance has not vitiated the trial. . . . (15)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Children Act (XXXIX of 1974)</strong><br/><strong>Section 51(2)</strong><br/><strong>We found on scrutiny that the age of convict appellants Ansarul Haque and Falan Miah were 14 to 15 years and 15 to 16 years respectively on 06.07.2002 when exhibits 4 and 5 (statements under section 164 Cr.P.C) were recorded. Trial Court found that on the date of judgment on 17.01.2004 the age of the appellants were 16 years 8 months, 14 days and 18 years, 8 months  and 14 days respectively. Thus it is apparent that the appellants Ansarul Huq and Falan Miah though were 14 to 15 and 15 to 16 years respectively when they committed the offence but when the impugned judgment was passed they were adult and today (when the appeal is finally disposed of) both the appellants are more than 23 years and 25 years respectively so they are now completely adult to serve out the sentence. Therefore, there was no necessity of direction in the impugned judgment to keep the appellants in separate arrangement and room from the adult offenders as provided on section 51(2) of the Act, 1974. .  . .(57)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Penal Code (XLV of 1860)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 302/34</strong><br/><strong>Children Act (XXXIX of 1974)</strong><br/><strong>Section 51(2)</strong><br/><strong>From the scrutiny of the evidence, circumstances and documents on record our conclusion is that the trial court rightly found the convict appellants guilty of the charges brought against them under section 302/34 of the Penal Code for killing the victim. We thus find no merit in the appeal which must fail, but we find it difficult to maintain the sentence of imprisonment for life as in view of the provision of awarded by the court below, section 51(2) of the Act, 1974. And accordingly, we are inclined to modify the sentence by reducing the same 10 years instead of imprisonment for life and also to impose fine.</strong><br/><strong>In the result, this appeal is dismissed with modification of sentence. Impugned judgment and order of conviction dated 17.1.2005 found by the Additional Sessions Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Mymensingh in sessions case No. 67 of 2002 is maintained but the appellants are sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 (ten) years instead of imprisonment for life as awarded by the learned Additional Sessions Judge and also to pay a fine of taka 2,000.00 each in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 2(two) months more. The quantum of the period of sentence which the appellants have already served out shall be deducted as per the provisions of section 35A of the Code. <u>The appellants are directed to surrender before the Court below to serve out remaining period of sentence</u>. . . .

The two convicts presented a petition of appeal before this court being Criminal Appeal No. 598 of 2005 against the judgment and order of conviction dated the 7<sup>th</sup> January 2005 passed in Sessions case No. 67 of 2002.<br/><br/>The prosecution case, briefly, is that one Md. Mostafa, the informant lodged the First Information Report, shortly, “FIR” on 30.04.2004 with Gafargaon police station, Mymensingh, alleging, <em>inter alia</em>,  that Runa aged about 10 (ten) years his only daughter was called out by appellant  Ansarul, son of Khaleque Miah on 29.04.2001 at about 6.30 p.m on the pretence of giving green mangoes in presence of her mother, Mst. Hazera Khatun but the victim did not return home.  The informant along with his relatives and friends searched for the victim at different places but in vain. As they could not find the victim they went to the house of Ansar and asked him about her whereabouts.  Ansar replied that after receiving green mangoes the victim went away and he could not say, thereafter, what happened. The informant for searched his daughter till 3.00 a.m of the following night. On 30.4.2001 early in the morning at around 6.00 a.m when his relative Mina Begum, wife of Bachchu went to collect leaves near the place of occurrence  found the dead body of the victim at the dried pond behind Aftabuddin’s house of Jonmoyjoy village and intimated the ghastly matter to the informant. Then the informant along with the local people went to the spot and identified the dead body of his daughter, the victim. They found the mouth and nose of the victim filled with earth as well injuries on the person of the victim; then the informant along with the Ward Commissioner of the Pourashava and other persons went to the house of Ansar and caught him, who told them he handed over the victim to the custody of Falan. After that the people caught Falan from his area who confessed that he took Runa in to the Jungle near the pond and tried to rape her but failed. He afraid that Runa would disclose the matter to others. He then began tussling and beating the victim. He killed Runa by suffocating her. According to the aforesaid confession it is clear that accused Falan and Ansarul with the illegal object of raping the victim called her away on the pretence of giving her mangoes and after failing to rape her they killed the victim and left her body near the pond of Aftab Uddin. That in the FIR Falan Miah was falsely shown as aged about 22 years and Ansarul Hoque as aged about 14 years.<br/><br/>Police took up the investigation of the case, visited the place of occurrence, prepared the inquest report of the victim Runa, Prepared the sketch map and the separate index thereon, sent the dead body to the morgue for post mortem examination, examined the witnesses and recorded their statements under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, (the code) then submitted charge sheet against the accused appellants under Section 302/34 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>Eventually the convict appellants were put on trial before the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Court No. 2, Mymensingh in sessions case No. 67 of 2002. The appellants were charged under section 302/34 of the Penal Code to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/><br/>During trial prosecution examined 18 witnesses, on the other hand, the defence examined none. The defence cross examined the prosecution witnesses. The case of the defence as it appears from the trend of cross examination of the prosecution witnesses was that of innocence. The further defence case was that the accused minor they were to the tried by a juvenile  court under the provisions of the Children Act, 1974 (the Act, 1974)  . Upon consideration of the evidence the trial court by the impugned Judgment and order found both the appellants Falan Mia and Ansarul Haque guilty under Section 302/34 of the Penal Code and sentenced them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life and also to pay a fine of Taka 2,000.00 each, in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 2(two) months more, hence this appeal.<br/><br/>Mr. Salauddin, Learned Advocate for the appellants by referring exhibits 4 &amp; 5 i.e the statements made by the appellants under section 164 of the Code recorded on 04.06.2001 (ext. 4) and 03.05.2001 (ext.5) respectively and also the judgment of the court below tried to impress upon us that on the date of the judgment the age of Falan Mia was 16 years, 8 months 14 days and that of Ansarul Haque was 18 years 8 months 14 days. The learned Advocate further submits that during trial the convict-appellants were minors and as such, the case was triable under the provision of the Children Act, 1974, shortly, the Act, 1974 by a Juvenile Court.  Learned Advocate does not dispute that Additional Sessions Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Mymensing which held the trial of the case was Juvenile Court as per provisions of section 4 of the Act, 1974  but no where within the proceeding of the case the trial court expressed itself as Juvenile Court nor the provisions of section 7 of the Act, 1974 were strictly observed and complied with as to the holding of the trial in a specified manner stated therein and, according to him, due to non compliance of the provisions of section 7 of the Act the trial has been vitiated. Learned Advocate further submits that provisions of section 51 and 71 of the Act, 1974 were not at all complied with and observed by the trial court as the words “conviction” and “sentenced” used in the impugned judgment contrary to the provisions of section 71 of the Act, 1974 and the minor accused were sentenced to suffer imprisonment for life which is prohibited under Section 51 of the Act, 1974. He has referred to the provision of section 52 of the Act, 1974  and has contended that trial court did not properly consider the provision of the said section according to which maximum period for detention of the child has been fixed to be not more than 10 years but in any case such period can not exceed the age of eighteen years of the child offender. The gist of the argument of appellants’ learned Advocate is that due to violation and non compliance of the Specific provisions of the Act, 1974, the trial of the case has been vitiated and such, the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence is liable to be set aside and the appeal be allowed. In support of his contentions the learned Advocate has retained in upon the case of The State -vs- Deputy Commissioner, Satkhira reported in 45 DLR 643.<br/><br/>Mr. Mohammad Ullah learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the state on the other hand  by referring Sections 3-8, 51-52 and 71 of the Act, 1974 submits that if the child is charged with the commission of an  offence exclusively triable by the court of Sessions then the case records is to be sent there for such trial. He further submits that if the child is charged of the offence under Section 302 of the Penal Code and if the charge is proved then there will be no scope for the court to award sentence less than what has been fixed in the section. By referring to 1<sup>st</sup> proviso to Section 51 of the Act 1974, the learned Deputy Attorney General further submits that if the child is found to have committed an offence of serious in nature and the court is of the opinion that punishment which it is authorized to inflict is insufficient then the court may sentence the child to imprisonment or order him to be detained in such place and on such contentions as it thinks fit. and no quantum (period) of “imprisonment” has been provided for in the said proviso. The learned Deputy Attorney General further submits that the prosecution witness having proved the prosecution case against the appellants beyond all reasonable doubt and the nature of the offence being serious in nature the learned Additional Sessions Judge rightly passed the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence and as such no interfere is called for with the same and the appeal be dismissed.<br/><br/>In view of the above contentions of the learned Advocate for the appellants and the learned Deputy Attorney General for the State we consider it profitable  to consider the provisions of sections 3-9, 51-52 and 71 of the Act, 1974 which are as follows;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“3.

From the record it appears that charge-sheet was submitted after investigation by the police under section 302/34 of the Penal Code against the appellants, namely, Ansarul Haque and Falan Mia both of whom were stated to be minors at the time of occurrence. Such fact of minority of the appellants was clearly been mentioned in exhibits 4, 5, i.e the  statements made by them under section 164 of the Code. The statements were recorded by PW 10 Mr. Main Uddin Ahmed, Magistrate, 1<sup>st</sup> class, Mymensingh. So, it is undisputed that the offence alleged to have been committed by the appellants was exclusively triable by the Court of Sessions and steps as per sections 5(3) and 8 of the Act, 1974 were rightly taken by the concerned Magistrate. There has been no objection or allegation as to violation of the provisions of section 6 of the Act which are related to joint trial of child offender with adult accused.<br/><br/>What has been agitated by the learned Advocate for the convict-appellants before us is that neither the Sessions Judge, Mymensingh registered the case as a Juvenile court case nor the Additional Sessions Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Mymensingh while holding trial of the case assumed his jurisdiction as a Juvenile court and proceeded with the trial of the case accordingly strictly following or observing the provisions of section 7 of the Act, 1974 and this non-observance of the provision of section 7 of the Act, 1974 has vitiated the trial.<br/><br/>When section 4 of the Act, 1974 clearly empowers the Sessions Judge and the Additional Sessions Judge to exercise the powers of Juvenile Court in the case involving child offenders for offence exclusively triable by Court of Sessions registration of the case after receipt of case record as Sessions case and not as a Juvenile Court case itself shall not expose to any gross irregularity Similarly, while  holding trial of such a case received on transfer from the Sessions Judge if the Additional Sessions Judge  does not note or mention in the record  that he was proceeding in the case as a Juvenile Court case also shall not render a trial illegal and the ultimate decision thereon unless it is shown specifically that there has been miscarriage of justice or failure of justice causing serious prejudice to the convict appellants became of such failure. In the instant case the convict appellants failed to show any such specific prejudice caused to them for above irregularity.<br/><br/>In section 7(1) of the Act, 1974 it has been provided that the Court shall hold its sitting at such place or places on such days and in such manner as may be prescribed. In section 7(2) of the Act, 1974 it has been provided that the Court shall as far as may be practicable sit in a building or room different from that in which the ordinary sittings of the Court are held or on different days ordinary settings of the court are held.<br/><br/>On scrutiny no penal provisions as to the consequence of any non-compliance of the said provisions has been provided for in the Act, 1974.<br/><br/>Children Rules 1976 (shortly Rules 1976) were made by gazette notification (extraordinary) published on 11<sup>th</sup> March 1976 under provision of section 77 of the Act, 1974. In rules 3 and 4 no penal provisions have been inserted as to the consequence of non-compliance of the said provisions in the light of above discussion it can be said that when no penal provisions has been provided in section 7 of the Act, 1974 for the consequence of non-compliance of the provisions therein it is  to be treated as directory and not mandatory. Therefore, if there has been any non-compliance of the said provision of law such non compliance has not vitiated the trial.<br/><br/>Moreover, except the verbal submission the learned for the appellants could not show anything specific in support of the point that the provisions of section 7 of the Act, 1974 were not complied with properly by the Additional Sessions Judge, while holding trial of the case. In the absence of any thing specific it may be presumed that said court acted properly in holding the trial in compliance with the provisions of section 7 of the Act. Therefore, we find no merit in the point as argued by the learned Advocate for the appellants as to the prejudice for non compliance with the provisions of section 7 of the Act, 1974.<br/><br/>It is true that under provisions of section 51 of the Act, 1974 no child shall be sentenced to death or imprisonment for life but in the 1<sup>st</sup> proviso to said section 51 it has been provided that, “when a child is found to have committed an offence of so serious in nature that the court is of opinion that no punishment which under provisions of this act is authorised to inflict, is sufficient “then the court may sentence the child to imprisonment or order him to be detained in such place and on such conditions as it thinks fit.” So it appears that the prohib-ition or restriction about awarding sentence  on a child offender as put  in section 51 has been  slightly relaxed in the 1<sup>st</sup> proviso to the effect that if the nature of offence committed by the child “is so serious in nature”(emphasis is given by us) the court may sentence the child to imprisonment. But the minimum quantum of the sentence of said “imprisonment” has not been fixed or ascertained any where within the Act, 1974.<br/><br/>We have already noticed earlier that as per provisions of sections 5(3) and 8 of the Act, 1974 if the offence committed by the child is exclusively triable by a Court of Sessions the case record has to be sent to him for trial and disposal. We have also noticed that charge-sheet was submitted against the appellants under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code and the case record was duly sent to the Court of Sessions wherefrom the same was sent to the Additional Sessions Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Mymensingh who accordingly held and disposed of the case by the impugned judgment and order. Punishment as provided under section 302 of the Penal Code is death or imprisonment for life. If someone is found guilty on trial by the court below under Section 302/34 Penal Code by the Court on trial sentence or punishment cannot be less than either death or imprisonment for life. Both the appellants were found guilty under sections 302/34 Penal Code and both of them were awarded sentence to suffer imprisonment for life along with a fine of Taka 2,000.00 in default, to suffer rigorous impriso-nment for two months more.<br/><br/>In section 51 of the Act, 1974 there is total prohibition as to the awarding of sentence of death on any child offender. But under 1<sup>st</sup> proviso to said section the Court has been authorized to award sentence of “imprisonment “on the child if the offence committed by him is of serious in nature. According to the learned Deputy Attorney General when the maximum quantum (period) of said “imprisonment” as it appears in 1<sup>st</sup> proviso of section 51 has not been fixed or available in the said Act itself and when the punishment for offence under section 302 of the Penal Code cannot be less than either death or imprisonment for life and when with regard to child sentence of death is prohibited under section 51 of the Act, then sentence for the offence under section 302 Penal Code  must be “imprisonment for life” in case the child offender if found guilty on trial.<br/><br/>It is true that maximum period of “imprisonment” stated in 1<sup>st</sup> proviso to section 51 of the Act, 1974 has not been available any where within the Act, 1974 itself. When sentence for offence under section 302 of the Penal Code has no scope to be less than imprisonment for life, such sentence can be conveniently awarded if the child offender is found guilty under section 302 Penal Code after trial. Maximum period of 10 years appearing in section 52 of the Act, 1974 is only related to the order of detention of the child in certified institute, such period for 10 years cannot be said to be the maximum period of “imprisonment” as a sentence as provided in the 1<sup>st</sup> proviso to section 51 of the Act 1974 with regard to punishment to be awarded to a child if he is found guilty of offence of so serious nature, as has been found in the instant case.<br/><br/>Let us now consider the merit of the case itself.<br/><br/>P.W. 1 Md. Mostafa, the informant as P. W.1 supported allegations made in the FIR. He proved his signature therein as exhibits 1 and 1/1.

He denied that he did not investigate the case properly.<br/> <br/>P.W. 18, Mansur Habib in his examination-in-chief stated that on 17.11.2001 he was attached to the Gafargaon police station as Sub-Inspector. Firstly Sub-Inspector Mahbubur Rahman then Sub-Inspector Omar Faruk inves-tigated the instant case and after completion of investigation submitted memorandum of evidence. On 18.08.2001 he received the case and after getting approval on 17.11.2001 he submitted Charge Sheet No. 199 dated 19.11.2001 against the convict-appellants under section 302/34 of the Penal Code and he was cross examined by the defence, but nothing contradictory was found from his evidence.<br/>These are the evidence produced by the prosecution.<br/><br/>The purpose of the examination of the accused under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (the code) of an accured is to facilitate him to explain any fact which came in evidence against him. Even without any pointing out of any incriminating materials or facts during examination under section 342 of the Code.<br/><br/>On perusal of exhibits 4 and 5 the two confessional statements of the two appellants it appears that no allegation was made to P.W. 10 about police beating, torture or threat when he recorded their statements under section 164 of the Code. From exhibits 4 and 5 it appears that P.W. 10 gave to the effect that endorsment statements made by the accused were true and voluntary. It also appears that exhibits 4 and 5 were recorded on 03.05.2001. The accused were examined under section 342 of the Code on 04.07.2004. There is nothing in the record to show that at any time after 03.05.2001 the accused ever filed any application to retract from their confessional statements made by them under section 164 of the Code on the very pretext and ground of police torture or threat. In the absence of any such move by the appellants, it is proved that the plea of police torture and threat disclosed in the statements during their examination under section 342 of the Code after thought. On minute scrutiny and perusal of exhibits 4 and 5 we find the same to be inculpatory, voluntary and true in nature. If the confessional statements of the appellants be found from scrutiny to be inculpatory, voluntary and true in nature, then this alone can be the basis of conviction.<br/><br/>In such regard reference may be made to the case of Sukhendra Das  -vs- State reported in 21 DLR 303 wherein it was held that confessional statement if found to be voluntary and true can alone be basis of conviction in a case. As against the maker himself his confession judicial or extra judicial retracted or not can in law validly form the basis of his conviction if the court is satisfied and believed that it is true and voluntary. In the present case besides the confessional statements of the appellants there are also other corroborative evidence, both oral and as well as circum-stantial as discussed above in details.<br/><br/>Trial court on proper analysis of the evidence on record and all attending circumstances came to correct finding and decision as to the guilt of the appellants.<br/><br/>We also noticed earlier that there is provision for imprisonment for child offender the 1<sup>st</sup> proviso to section 51 of the Act, 1974. According to the arguments advanced by the learned Deputy Attorney General, impris-onment for life can be maintained if the child offenders are charged under section 302 or 302/34 of the Penal Code but since we observed earlier that maximum period of 10 years detention as appears in section 52 of the Children Act, 1974 exclusively related to detention of child offender in certified institute only and as such above maximum period of 10 years cannot be imposed as the sentence for life of any child liable for offence under section 302 of the Penal Code is prescribed. It further  appears from the record that it was sent to the trial court pursuant the provisions of section 5(3) and section 8 of the Act, 1974. We found on scrutiny that the age of convict appellants Ansarul Haque and Falan Miah were 14 to 15 years and 15 to 16 years respectively on 06.07.2002 when exhibits 4 and 5 (statements under section 164 Cr.P.C) were recorded. Trial Court found that on the date of judgment on 17.01.2004 the age of he appellants were 16 years 8 months, 14 days and 18 years, 8 months  and 14 days respectively. Thus it is apparent that the appellants Ansarul Huq and Falan Miah though were 14 to 15 and 15 to 16 years respectively when they committed the offence but when the impugned judgment was passed they were adult and today (when the appeal is finally disposed of) both the appellants are more than 23 years and 25 years respectively so they are now completely adult to serve out the sentence. Therefore, there was no necessity of direction in the impugned judgment to keep the appellants in separate arrangement and room from the adult offenders as provided on section 51(2) of the Act, 1974.<br/><br/>Section 51(2) runs as follows;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Sentence for imprisonment shall not be allowed to associate with adult prisoner”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From the above scrutiny of the evidence, circumstances and documents on record our conclusion is that the trial court rightly found the convict appellants guilty of the charges brought against them under section 302/34 of the Penal Code for killing the victim. We thus find no merit in the appeal which must fail, but we find it difficult to maintain the sentence of imprisonment for life as in view of the provision of awarded by the court below, section 51(2) of the Act, 1974. And accordingly, we are inclined to modify the sentence by reducing the same 10 years instead of imprisonment for life and also to impose fine.<br/><br/>In the result, this appeal is dismissed with modification of sentence. Impugned judgment and order of conviction dated 17.1.2005 found by the Additional Sessions Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Mymensingh in sessions case No. 67 of 2002 is maintained but the appellants are sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 (ten) years instead of imprisonment for life as awarded by the learned Additional Sessions Judge and also to pay a fine of taka 2,000.00 each in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 2(two) months more. The quantum of the period of sentence which the appellants have already served out shall be deducted as per the provisions of section 35A of the Code. <u>The appellants are directed to surrender before the Court below to serve out remaining period of sentence</u>.<br/><br/>Lower court records be sent down at once.<br/><br/>Communicate this order at once<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Rezaul Hasan, J.</u></strong></span><br/> <br/>This is an application under section 81(2) read with section 83 and 85 of the Companies Act, 1994 (the Act). Let the supplementary affidavit do from part of the substantive application.<br/><br/>It has been stated in the petition, amongst other, that the petitioner is the Shareholder-Member of MAQ Paper Industries Ltd, a public company limited by shares and incorporated in the year 1992, having its head office at 141/1, Segunbagicha, Dhaka (<em>henceforth referred to as the Company</em>). It has been listed with the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) in the year 2009 and now it falls under Z-category; that from its incorporation till 2000 the Company had been duly submitting all necessary documents and papers to the concerned authorities, including RJSC, in the result nothing remained pending/due till the FY 1999-2000; that the Company obtained last clearance certificate of submission of minutes of Annual General Meeting (AGM), returns of the share capital and other documents of the Company on 30.08.2001; that the Company could not hold its AGM in time due to unavoidable loss and damage suffered by the Company from fire accidents, change of directorships and members etcetra; that consequently, the Company has failed to submit AGM and Returns of Shares from 2000-2005; that thereafter, Company filed a petition, being Company Matter No. 05 of 2005, before the High Court Division under Section 81(2) read with Section 83 and 85 of the Companies Act, 1994, for condonation of delay in holding those AGMs and also for obtaining permission to submit the reports and returns of shares to RJSC for the years 2001-2005; that when that matter was pending before the Court, the Company was informed by the respondent No. 2 (SEC), vide letter dated 22.08.2005; that it was directed by the Secretary of the concerned Ministry, vide notification dated 6.08.2005 that a recommendation was proposed that for condonation of delay in holding those AGMs and for submitting the same before the RJSC no further permission might be required to be taken from High Court Division; that the respondent was also orally informed earlier that the concerned Ministry and the respondent Bangladesh Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) was under legal obligation to re-consider the matter that whether it was necessary to obtain permission from the High Court Division for condonation of delay in holding AGM and they were trying to find out a solution since June, 2004, which was evident from the letters dated 6.12.2004 and 5.01.2005; that BSEC sent those letters also to the Company; that therefore, the Company caused default under the instruction of the SEC and the aforesaid company matter was dismissed for default; therefore the Company was requested not to proceed with the pending matter on this issue before the Court; that thereafter the Company kept waiting by the SEC for the final decision, but no such positive decision has yet been given by the SEC. Thereafter, petitioner repeatedly requested the SEC to receive Audited Account Reports, AGM, Returns of Shares and other relevant documents of the Company to the SEC and also sought for its advice; but the BSEC paid no heed thereon; that lastly, the petitioner approached before the RJSC for submitting the AGM, Returns of Shares and other documents of the Company, but BSEC refused to accept the same without having prior permission of the High Court Division.<br/><br/>Hence this application for condonation of delay to holding the Annual General Meeting for the years 2001 to 2012.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Shah Monjurul Hoque, alongwith Ms. Fatema Khatun, appearing for the petitioner, having placed the petition alongwith the documents annexed therewith, submits that the company was incorporated on 27.02.1992, vide certificate of incorporation No. C-21829(236) /96, as a public company limited by shares and that the company is listed with the Stock Exchanges as a ‘Z’ category company. He further submits that since incorporation till 2000 the company duly held its Annual General Meetings and complied with all legal formalities, but the company could not hold its Annual General Meetings from 2001 to 2012. He also submits that the company filed an petition, being company matter No. 5 of 2005, before the High Court Division under Section 81(2) read with Section 83 and 85 of the Companies Act, 1994, for condonation of delay in holding AGMs and also for obtaining permission to submit AGM and Returns of Shares to RJSC for the years 2001-2005. When that matter was pending before the Court, the Company was informed by the respondent no. 2, BSEC, vide letter dated 22.08.2005 that it was directed by the secretary of the concerned Ministry, vide a notification dated 6.08.2005, that a recommendation was proposed that for condonation of delay in holding AGM and for submitting the same before the RJSC no further permission might be required to be taken from High Court Division. He next submits that, in these circumstance the Company Matter No. 5 of 2005 was dismissed for default. He also submits that thereafter the company was kept waiting by the SEC for its final decision, but no decision has yet been given by the SEC. Thereafter, petitioner repeatedly requested the SEC to receive Audited Account Reports, AGM, Returns of Shares and other relevant documents of the Company to the SEC and also sought for advice; but SEC paid no heed thereon. Lastly, the petitioner approached before the RJSC for submitting the AGM, Returns of Shares and other documents of the Company, but SEC refused to accept the same without having prior permission of the Hon’ble High Court Division. Accordingly, he concludes that there was no willful laches on part of the company in holding the aforesaid Annual General Meetings for the period from 2001 to 2012. He continues that this petition has been filed in good faith and unless the delay occurred in holding the aforesaid Annual General Meetings is not condoned the company as well as the share-holders/members will suffer irreparable loss. On a query from the Bench, as to whether the company is a going concern, the learned advocate has submitted a supplementary affidavit, sworn on 5.3.14, enclosing auditors report for the year ended on 31.12.2012 and submits that the company has been auditing its account on regular basis since 1<sup>st</sup> January 2001 to 31<sup>st</sup> December 2012 and, as such, evidently the company is a going concern. At last, based on foregoing facts and circumstances, he has prayed that the entire period of delay in holding the Annual General Meetings for the years from 2001 to 2012 may be condoned and the company may be permitted to hold its AGM for the aforesaid years.<br/><br/>No one appeared to oppose the application, even the SEC although it is respondent No. 2 and the petition contains certain statements about it.<br/><br/>I have heard the learned advocate, perused the petition and the documents annexed therewith.<br/>Admittedly, the company was incorpora-ted in the year 1992. It has been stated that till 2000 the company has held each Annual General Meeting without any default. Thereafter, as stated in the petition, the company could not hold its Annual General Meetings from for the years 2001 to 2012 for the reasons as stated in the substantive petition and as explained in the course of submission of the learned advocate for the petitioner. Hence, these are not needed to be repeated. Be that as it may, admittedly the company could not hold its Annual General Meetings for the years 2001 to 2012 and filed this petition for condonation of delay in holding those Annual General Meetings. The petitioner has submitted an audit report ended as at December 30<sup>th</sup> 2012 to show that it is a going concern and has been regularly auditing account its since 2001.<br/><br/>In this connection, I have taken for consideration section 210 of the Companies Act, 1994 that reads as follows:<br/><br/><em>   “210. <strong>Appointment and remuneration of auditors</strong>- (1) Every company shall, at each annual general meeting appoint an auditor or auditors to hold office from the conclusion of that meeting until the next annual general meeting and shall within seven days of the appointment, give intimation thereof to every auditor os appointed:</em><br/><em>   Provided that no person can be appointed auditor of any company unless his written consent has been obtained prior to such appointment or re-appointment.</em><br/><em>   (2)        Every auditor appointed under sub-section (1) shall, within thirty days of the receipt from the company of the intimation of his appointment, inform the Registrar in writing that he has accepted, or refused to accept, the appointment.</em><br/><em>   (3)        At any annual General meeting a retiring auditor, by whatsoever authority appointed, shall be reappointed, unless- </em><br/><em>(a) he is not qualified for re-appointment; or </em><br/><em>(b) he has given the company notice in writings of his unwillingness to be re-appointed; or </em><br/><em>(c) a resolution has been passed at the meeting appointing some body else instead of him or providing expressely that he shall not be re-appointed: </em><br/><em>Provided that for the purpose of passing a resolution under clause (c), a notice thereof shall in accordance with section 211 be issued prior to the meeting, and such resolution cannot be passed except on the ground of death, incapacity or dishonesty or disqualification of the retiring auditor,</em><br/><em>(4)  <u>if an appointment of an auditor is not made at an annual general meeting, the Government may appoint a person to fill the vacancy</u>.</em><br/><em>(5)  The company shall, within seven days of the Governments power under sub-section (4) becoming exercisable, give notice of that fact to the Government; and, if a company fails to give such notice, the company, and also every officer of the company who is in default, shall be punishable with fine which may extend to one thousand taka.</em><br/><em>(6)  <u>The first auditor or auditors of a company shall be appointed by the Board of Directors within one month of the date of Registration of the company, and the auditor or auditors so appointed shall hold office until the conclusion of the first annual general meeting</u>:</em><br/><em><u>Provided that</u></em><em>- </em><br/><em>(a) <u>the company may, at a general meeting remove any such auditor or all or any of such auditors and appoint in his or their place any other person or persons who have been nominated for appointment by any member of the company, and or whose nomination notice has been given to the members of the company not less than fourteen days before the date of the meeting; and</u></em><br/><em>(b) <u>if the Board of Directors fails to exercise its powers under this sub-section, the company in a general meeting, may appoint the first auditor or auditors</u>.</em><br/><em>(7)  The Board may fill any casual vacancy in the office of any auditor, but while any such vacancy continues, the remaining auditor or auditors, if any, may act:</em><br/><em>Provided that where such vacancy is caused by the resignation of an auditor, the vacancy shall only be filled by the company in general meeting.</em><br/><em>(8) Any auditor appointed in a casual vacancy shall hold office until the conclusion of the next annual general meeting.</em><br/><em>(9)  Except an provided in the process pursuant to sub-section (7), any auditor appointed under this section may be removed from office before the expiry of his term only by a special resolution of the company in the general meeting.</em><br/><em>(10)            The remuneration of the auditors of a company-</em><br/><em>(a) in the case of an auditor appointed by the Board or the Government, shall be fixed by the Board or the Government respectively; and</em><br/><em>(b) subject to clause (a), shall be fixed by the company in the general meeting or in such manner as the company in the general meeting may determine.</em><br/><em>(11)            For the purposes of sub-section (10), any sums paid by the company in respect of the auditors expenses shall be deemed to be included in the expression “remuneration”. (empasis added)</em><br/><br/>Evidently, sub-section (4) of section 210 stipulates that, if appointment of an auditor is not made at an Annual General Meeting the government may appointment a person to fill the vacancy. Admittedly, the company did not hold its Annual General Meetings for the Financial year 2000-2001 (FY 2000-2001), in respect of the AGM schedule to be held on in the year 2011. As such, no auditor was appointed in the Annual General Meeting scheduled to be hold in the year 2011, as required by the provision of sub-section (1) of section 210 of the Companyies Act, 1994. Therefore, the auditors alleged to have been appointed by the Board of Directors for the FY 2000-2001 to FY 2001-2012 is contrary to the provisions subsection (1) of section 210 of the Companies Act, since no Annual General Meeting was held in the year 2001 or in the subsequent years. Hence, in may considered opinion, the auditor(s) appointed by the Board of Director for the FY 2000-2001 to FY 2011 and 2001 to 2012 is country to the provision of subsection (1) of section 210 of the Companies Act. Therefore, the auditors appointed by the Board for auditing the account of the company for FY 2000-2011 to 2001-2012 was beyond there authority of the Board of Directors because, except the first auditor/auditors, all other auditors shall be appointed in the Annual General Meetings, vide the provisions of sub-section (6) read with sub-section (1) of section 210 of the Companies Act. Hence, I hold that the auditor(s) appointed for auditing the account for the years 2001 to 2012 was ultravires the authority of the Board of Directors and the audit reports submitted for the years 2001 to 2012 are of no legal effect and are not acceptable in law.<br/><br/>The directors may fill up any casual vacancy occurred in the office of the auditors. But, the question of casual vacancy would arise only when an auditor was duly appointed. In the instant case, no auditor was appointed in the Annual General Meetings (scheduled to be held in the year 2001), so the question of any casual vacancy or to fill the same up by the board of directors does not arise.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Rule (3A) of Rules 12 Securities &amp; Exchange Rules, 1987, (hearing after referred as the Rules) provides as follows: “(3A) The financial statements referred to in sub-rule (1) shall be audited within one hundred and twenty days from the date on which the issuer’s financial year ends and a copy of such audited financial statements shall be submitted to the Commission and the Stock Exchange within fourteen days thereof:<br/>         Provided that on the application filed by the issuer within the aforesaid specified time the Commission may on good cause shown and only under extreme circumstances extend the time for a auditing the financial statements or submission of the financial statements to the Commission, as the case may be, as it deems fit:<br/>         Provided further that if an issuer fails to get its financial statement, audited in the manner as specified in sub-rule (3) and fails to submit the same to the Commission and the stock exchange within the said specified time, or extended time, as the case may be, <u>the Commission may appoint an auditor to audit the accounts of the issuer at the issuer’s cost</u>.” But there is nothing on record to show that any auditor was appointed under sub-rules (3A) of Rule 12 of the SEC Rules, 1987, or in the manner as prescribed  under the provisions of sections 210 of the Companies Act.<br/><br/><strong>It is legal duty on the part of a listed company to get its account audited within the time or within the extended time, as the case may be, as laid down in sub-rules (3A) of Rule 12 of SEC Rules, 1987. Otherwise, the Commission (SEC) may appoint an auditor to audit the account of the issuer at the issuer’s cost</strong>.<br/><br/><strong>For the reasons herein before recorded,</strong><strong> I am of further view that the auditors appointed by the Board of Directors for auditing the accounts of the company, not being appointed in the manner laid down in sub-section (1) of section 210 of the Companies Act, they had no authority to audit the financial statements of the company, and the audit reports for years 2001 to 2012 are not audit reports in the eye of law and shall not be treated as compliance on the part of the company or as proper audit of the accounts of the company, for those financial years</strong>.<br/><br/><strong>Having considered the provisions of sub-section (4) of section 210 of the Companies Act vis-à-vis the provision laid down in sub-rules (3A) of Rules 12 of the SEC Rules, 1987, I am of the considered opinion that, in respect of a company listed with the Stock Exchanges, the Rules made under the Securities and Exchanges Commission Ordinance, 1969, being a Special Law, the provision of sub-rule (3A) of Rule 12 of the SEC Rules, 1987, shall override the provision of subsection (4) of section 210 of the Companies Act, 1994, authorizing the government to appoint auditor, if no auditor is appointed in the AGM, as required by sub-section (1) of section 210 of the Act. Commission shall appoint an auditor, as per provisions of sub-rule (3A) of Rule 12 of SEC Rules, 1987, to audit the accounts of the company for the FY 2000-2001, to be submitted in the AGM scheduled to be held in the year 2001. This auditor appointed by the Commission, for FY 2000-2001, may either be continued or a new auditor may be appointed in the subsequent Annual General Meetings to be held pursuant to the order of this court, as permitted by the provision of subsection (1) of section 210 of the Companies Act that stipulates that every company shall, at each Annual General Meeting, appoint auditor or auditors to hold office from the conclusion of that meetings until the next Annual General Meeting</strong>.<br/><br/>I have also considered the decision reported in 1986 BLD (AD), page 311: Ghyasuddin Ahmed vs. Q. A. Faruque. That judgment was delivered by the Appellate Division with a direction to hold the first Annual General Meeting of the company under the chairmanship of a neutral person and for placing balance sheets, profit and loss accounts before the meetings after auditing the same. That matter was considered as per provision of section 79(3) of the Companies Act 1913 and this is the consistent view of this court. This court’s power to pass a direction to call, hold and conduct the Annual General Meeting is undisputed. However, in the instant case, this court is not appointing an auditor, nor the company has appointed any auditor in its Annual General Meeting, in this case. Hence, on this aspect, the instant case is liable to be distinguished from the case reported in 1906 BLD (AD) 311. Besides, another aspect, having jurisdictional relevance, to be noted here is that the judgment reported in 1986 BLD (AD) 311 was passed on 24.03.1986 i.e. before Companies Rules, 2009, has been framed. The Rules has invested inherent jurisdiction in this court under Rule 8, in addition to the inherent power vested in this court under Rule 263 of the said Rules.<br/><br/><strong>The concept ‘inherent jurisdiction’ is far wider than the concept ‘inherent power’. This court derives jurisdiction in company matters from two sources, one is section 3 of the Companies Act, 1994, and another is Rule 8 of the Companies Rules, 2009. Therefore, in an appropriate case, this court, in appointing auditor, may exercise its inherent jurisdiction, for ends of justice, particularly when the inaction, neglect of duty or malafide on the part of concerned authority/regularity body is apparent from the materials on record. In otherwords, provision of Rule 8 of the Companies Rules, 2009 has overriding effect upon sub-rule (3A) of Rule 12 of the SEC Rules, 1987 as well as upon the provision of sub-section (4) of section 210 of the Companies Act, 1994</strong>.<br/><br/>Before parting of, this court notes dissatisfaction to the inaction, non-performance of statutory duties and indifferences on the part of the SEC, and their go slow or keeping the eyes closed like attitude in performing its duties entrusted upon it, to ensure compliance of the applicable laws, Rules and the notifications issued by it. How far the SEC is efficient and anxious in protecting interest of the small investors and in maintaining discipline in the capital market needs to be screened by studing its function since 1995 to 2012. SEC even did not appear in this case, although it is respondent No. 2. It has utterly failed to perform its duties as per provision of sub-rule (3A) of Rule 12 of the SEC Rules, 1987, in appointing auditor. If the small investor’s trust in capital market is diminished then this the alternative source (the capital market) to procure equity, without recurring interest, will become a desert, unlike the industrialized economies. Besides, this alternative source (the capital market) available for procuring interest free equity must have positive impact on the economy in that it will most likely compel reducing bank interest rate and will have its competitive role as an alternative to money market. These deserves active attention of the authority which is entrusted to oversee the activities of the SEC, so that necessary enactments/amendment and/or guidelines can be made or formulated, as the case may be.<br/><br/>In view of the facts, circumstances and the deliberation recorded above, I find merit in this petition.<br/><br/>In the result the petition is allowed subject to certain directions.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the entire period of delay that has occurred in holding the Annual General Meetings of MAQ Paper Enterprise Ltd for the period of 2001 to 2012, is hereby condoned and the company is permitted to hold those Annual General Meetings, within 6(six) months from drawing up of this order and upon  following the provisions of law and the Rules applicable to a public company listed with the Stock Exchanges and subject to appointment of auditor and doing fresh audit in respect of those years as per provisions laid down in sub-rule (3A) of Rules 12 of the Securities &amp; Exchange Rules, 1987, read with subsection (1) of section 210 of the Companies Act, 2010.<br/><br/>The appointment of auditors by the Board of director, to audit the accounts of the company for the FY 2000-2001 to FY 2001-2012 is hereby declared ultravires and the audit reports for those period are neither to be treated as valid reports, nor to be placed for approval in any AGM for the said period.<br/><br/>The respondent No. 2 (SEC) is directed to appoint, within 14 days from receiving copy of this judgment and order, an auditor, from any one of the reputed audit firms having at least 3 years experience in auditing the account of a listed company, to audit the account of Paper Industries Ltd, for the FY 2000-2011 only and to submit a compliance report within 7(seven) days thereafter.<br/><br/>The auditors for the FY 2001-2002 to FY 2011-2012 is/are to be appointed in the respective AGM, according to the provision of sub-section (1) of section 210 of the Companies Act, 1994.<br/><br/>This order will be effective subject compliance of the direction regarding donation.<br/><br/>Cost will be borne by the company.<br/><br/>Let a copy of this judgment and order be sent to the Registrar of the Joint Stock Companies and Firms for record and for acceptance of the documents to be filed pursuant to the meetings to be held pursuant to this court’s order and as may be required to be filed as per law.<br/><br/>         Let another copy of this judgment and order be sent to the Chairman, Bangladesh Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, Jibon Bima Tower, Dilkusha C/A, Dhaka, though special messenger, at the cost of the petitioner.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Nazrul Islam is directed against the judgment and order dated 03.12.2007 passed by the High Court Division in Death Reference No. 27 of 2003, which was heard along with Criminal Appeal No.786 of 2003 and Jail Appeal No.191 of 2003 accepting the reference, dismissing the criminal appeal and jail appeal.<br/><br/>The prosecution case, in brief, is that Milon Akhter (deceased), younger sister of the informant was given in marriage to condemned prisoner Md. Nazrul Islam (henceforth referred to as “the accused”), 6 years back. After 6 months of the solemnization of marriage, the accused went to Saudi Arabia to work and stayed there for 2 years. Thereafter, he returned home and the couple was blessed with a son, named Nazmul Islam aged about 4 years at the time of the occurrence. The accused used to beat his wife now and then on the ground that his wife used to lead an immoral life and she was a woman of questionable character. Milon Akhter (deceased) used to live in the same mess with her husband, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, elder brother-in-law and son. The informant used to live on the same plot adjacent to the dwelling house of her sister Milon Akhter (deceased). On 12.04.2002 at 00.15 a.m., the accused started beating his wife in the northern room of their east faced half-brick-built house. At that time, his wife raised alarm and Tajul Islam, brother-in-law (fvmyi) of the deceased, Afia Khatun, mother-in-law and other people went there, but the accused bolted the door from inside and tied up the hands and legs of his wife and dealt boti dao blows on her face, chest, wrist, left thigh, abdomen and on her arms causing severe bleeding injuries and killed her by cutting her throat. Nazma Rahman (the informant)(P.W.1), Md. Tajul Islam (P.W.2), Abdul Jalil (P.W.7), Md. Babul Mia (P.W.5) and others saw the occurrence through the glass window. They informed the matter to Uttara Police Station and accordingly police came to the place of occurrence. The accused opened the door and police arrested him from the room. He made an extra-judicial confession before the public that he killed his wife. Police also recovered the blood stained boti dao from the place of occurrence. The informant lodged the First Information Report (F.I.R.) on 12.04.2002 before the Officer-in-Charge of Uttara Police Station, D.M.P., Dhaka against the accused under section 302 of the Penal Code. Accordingly, Uttara P.S. Case No.25 dated 12.04.2002 corresponding to G.R. No.725/2002 was started.<br/>  <br/>The Investigating Officer took up the case for investigation. He visited the place of occurrence, prepared the sketch map with separate index, prepared inquest report, examined the witnesses and recorded their statements under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. After completion of investigation he submitted Charge-sheet No.145 dated 16.06.2002 under section 302 of the Penal Code against the accused.<br/><br/>The case was ultimately transferred to the Court of Bicharok, Druto Bichar Tribunal No.4, Dhaka where it was numbered as Druto Bichar Tribunal Case No.2 of 2003.<br/><br/>Charge was framed under section 302 of the Penal Code against the accused and read over and explained to him, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. During trial the prosecution examined as many as 9 (nine) P.Ws. who were cross-examined by the defence, but the defence did not examine any witness.<br/><br/>The defence case, as it transpires from the trend of cross-examination was that the accused was innocent. The informant, who was the step-sister of the deceased, had illicit connection with the accused, who used to send money to her from Saudi Arabia, and with the help of hired people she had the victim killed with an ulterior motive to grab the money.<br/><br/>After close of recording of evidence, the accused was examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He repeated his innocence.<br/><br/>The Bicharok of the Druto Bichar Tribunal, Dhaka after hearing the parties and upon consideration of the evidence and materials on record convicted the accused under section 302 of the Penal Code and sentenced him to death by his judgment and order dated 19.03.2003.<br/><br/>Reference under section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was made to the High Court Division for confirmation of the sentence of death, which was numbered as Death Reference No.27 of 2003.<br/><br/>Before the High Court Division the Criminal Appeal No.786 of 2003 with Jail Appeal No.191 of 2003 were preferred by the condemned petitioner, which were heard along with the death reference. By the impugned judgment and order, the High Court Division accepted the reference and dismissed the criminal appeal with jail appeal and confirmed the judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed by the Bicharok of the Druto Bichar Tribunal No.4, Dhaka. Hence, the condemned prisoner has filed the instant Jail Petition No.17 of 2010 before this Division.<br/><br/>Mr. Helaluddin Mollah, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that admittedly the victim was the petitioner’s wife who met her death inside his house. But no one saw the accused inflicting the injuries upon the victim which resulted in her death. He further submits that according to the evidence of the witnesses the petitioner after returning from abroad had argument with his sister-in-law, the informant, regarding money which he had remitted from abroad and he was occasionally abnormal. He also pointed out that the condemned petitioner has been in the condemned cell since 19.03.2003 for about 9 years suffering the pangs of death while his appeal and death reference was pending before the High Court Division. He finally submits that the petitioner has a child who was aged four years at the time. He prays that in view of the extenuating circumstances, this Division will have mercy and commute the sentence of death. <br/><br/>Mr. Md. Shahrowardi, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing on behalf of the State submits that the occurrence took place inside the bedroom of the petitioner where he brutally killed the victim who was his wife. He further submits that in the facts and circums-tances of the case, the petitioner was rightly sentenced to death by the trial Court and the reference was accepted by the High Court Division and he does not deserve any leniency from this Division.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates for the parties concerned and perused the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record. <br/>      <br/>It is in evidence that the victim was killed by the accused inside her bedroom and, according to the evidence of the mother and brother of the accused, the door of the room was locked from inside. The door was also found locked from the outside to prevent his escape before arrival of the police. The police arrested the condemned petitioner from the place near the victim’s dead body. The police also seized the blood stained dao which the condemned petitioner had used to kill his wife. According to the post mortem report and the evidence of P.W.9 the Doctor, there were as many as eight ‘chop wounds’ found on various parts of the body of the victim. In the opinion of the Doctor, the death was due to haem-orrhage and shock following injuries to the neck and different parts of the body with the heavy sharp cutting weapon. The occurrence was corroborated by the evidence of the mother and brother of the condemned petitioner as well as other independent witnesses. In view of such evidence the conviction under section 302 of the Penal Code as found by the trial Court and affirmed by the High Court Division, cannot be faulted.<br/><br/>With regard to the sentence of death awarded by the trial Court and confirmed by the High Court Division, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner begs mercy of this Court and prays for commutation of the sentence of death.<br/><br/>In reaching its decision, the High Court Division relied upon a number of decisions of this Division as well as the decision of the High Court Division in the case of State Vs. Kalu Bepari. In each of the cases referred the victim was the wife of the accused. The pertinent question in those cases was whether it was established by evidence that the accused person was in his house where his wife was murdered, failing which he could not be saddled with any onus to prove his innocence. If it could be established by evidence that the accused was in his house at the material time then the Court would consider his failure to adduce explanation or the falsity of his explanation along with other incriminating circumstances. The High Court Division relied upon the cases of State Vs. Kalu Bepari reported in 43 DLR 249; Abdul Motleb Howlader Vs. The State, 5 MLR(AD)362; Ilias Hussain (Md) Vs. The State, 54 DLR (AD)78 and Shamsuddin Vs. The State, 45 DLR 587 which in turn relied upon State Vs. Kalu Bepari (cited above) and held that the accused (petitioner before us) was responsible for causing the death of his wife.<br/><br/>The High Court Division then considered the circumstances in which the condemned petitioner killed his wife taking into account the fact that “the accused inflicted multiple sharp chop injuries on various parts of the body of the deceased. Before chopping, the accused tied up the hands and legs of his wife with clothes. Thereafter, he dealt boti blows and slaughtered his wife. All these circumstances proved that the accused had all the intention to kill his wife”. This led the High Court Division to the conclusion that the act of the accused falls within the mischief of murder as provided under section 300 of the Penal Code.<br/>At the appeal hearing before the High Court Division the learned Advocate for the accused-appellant pleaded that the accused had been languishing in the condemned cell for 4 years and 9 months which was not accepted by that Division as a ground for commuting the sentence of death. In this regard the High Court Division relied upon the decision in the case of Abed Ali Vs. The State reported in 42 DLR (AD) 171 where their Lordships referred to the case of Nowsher Ali Vs. State, 39 DLR 57, wherein it was held that “the delay in execution of death sentence for want of confirmation cannot by itself constitute mitigating circums-tance but abnormal and excessive delay of 6 years may be considered for commutation of death to life imprisonment”. However, in the facts presented in Abed Ali’s case their Lordships felt obliged to sustain the order of conviction and sentence. <br/><br/>It is noteworthy that the High Court Division also referred to the decision in the case of Abdul Bashir alias Bashu Vs. The State reported in 56 DLR (AD)207 and the case of Giasuddin and another Vs. The State reported in 54 DLR (AD)(2002)146 where the delay was not accepted as a ground for commutation of sentence. <br/><br/>In the latter case this Division observed that “these two condemned prisoners committed a cold-blooded murder in broad daylight and the materials on record clearly proved that they hatched a plan to commit murder and with that intention they were following the movements of the deceased … … their act of commission of murder was premeditated, cold-blooded and so brutal that they deserve no mercy and justice demands adequate and proper punishment which has been awarded”.<br/><br/>In the instant case the High Court Division observed that before the victim was done to death, the husband tied up her hands and legs with clothes and killed her by inflicting indiscriminate blows by boti dao. He closed the door of the room from inside so that others could not come to her rescue. Hence, the High Court Division found that the accused deserved no sympathy from the Court.<br/><br/>The facts of the instant case disclose a number of mitigating aspects which have come to light:(i) the first and foremost is the fact that there is a child of the accused who was four years old at the time of occurrence in 2002; (ii) The age of the accused who was twenty seven years old at the time of occurrence; (iii) the fact that the mental state of the accused had been affected due to squandering of his hard earned money by family members, principally his sister-in-law who was the victim’s step sister; and (iv) the length of time the accused has spent in the condemned cell since the date of judgment of the trial Court on 19 March 2003, amounting to 9 years.<br/><br/>With regard to the first mitigating circumstance mentioned above, reference may be made to the judgement delivered by B.B. Roy Chowdhury, J. when his Lordship was presiding a High Court Division Bench, where the existence of wife and children swayed their Lordships to commute the sentence of death to one of imprisonment for life. In similar fashion in the case of Ananta Kumar Karan Vs. the State reported in AIR 1962 Calcutta 428, their Lordships noted that large number of incised injuries were inflicted on the deceased by a sword and the accused absconded for a number of years; their Lordships observed that although the assault was brutal in nature, the fact remains that the prosecution did not prove the motive for the assault and killing. The sentence of death was commuted to imprisonment for life on account of the age of the appellant and the fact that he had a wife and a number of children living which in their Lordships’ view constituted an extenuation of the offence which at first struck them as brutal beyond word.<br/><br/>I have already referred to the age of the accused being a ground for commutation of sentence while mentioning the case of State Vs. Tasiruddin reported in 13 DLR 203 which was referred by this Division in the case of Jail Petition No.15 of 2010. From the cases referred in the Tasiruddin case it can be seen that age of the offender upto 27 years has been considered as a ground for commutation of the sentence of death.<br/><br/>The aspect of the mental state of the accused as disclosed by the evidence of P.Ws. 2 and 3 coupled with the fact that no motive for the murder was disclosed by the prosecution, can be taken as an extenuating fact for reducing the sentence, as was done in the Ananta Kumar Karan case mentioned above.<br/><br/>Lastly, with regard to the period of time spent by the accused in the condemned cell, there are numerous decisions of this Division which shed light on this aspect. In general terms, it may be stated that the length of period spent by a convict in the condemned cell is not necessarily a ground for commutation of the sentence of death. However, where the period spent in the condemned cell is not due to any fault of the convict and where the period spent there is inordinately long, it may be considered as an extenuating ground sufficient for commutation of sentence of death. It is noted that the High Court Division in rejecting this plea referred to the case of Abed Ali Vs. the State, cited above. In that case this Division held that delay in execution cannot by itself constitute a mitigating circumstance, but mention was made of the Nowsher Ali case (cited above) where it was observed that <u>a delay of six years may be considered for commutation of death sentence to life imprisonment</u> (emphasis added). In the instant case, when the matter was heard by the High Court Division the convict had been in the condemned cell for less than five years, and hence the plea was rejected. However, the convict has now been in the condemned cell for more than 9.5 years due to no fault of his own. Thus the length of period by now can be taken as a circumstance, when there are other extenuating circumstances, to commute the sentence of death to one of imprisonment for life.<br/><br/>Considering the above facts and circumstances, we are of the view that the judgment of the High Court Division be upheld so far as it relates to conviction of the accused under section 302 of the Penal Code. The Jail Petition is therefore dismissed. However, in the light of the discussion regarding sentence, we are of the view that, in the facts and circumstances of the case, justice will be sufficiently met if the sentence of death is commuted to one of imprisonment for life.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the sentence of the convict Md. Nazrul Islam is modified to imprisonment for life.<br/><br/><strong>         Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Ziaul Karim, J:</u></strong><br/>                       <br/>By this Rule, the accused petitioners have challenged the legality and propriety of the order dated 30-09-2005 passed by learned Special Sessions Judge, Noakhali, framing charge under Sections 302,201 of the Penal Code against the accused petitioners in Session Case no. 38 of 2004.<br/><br/>Facts in brief are that on 10-02-1996 one Md. Jalaluddin as informant reported to the Companigong Police Station to the effect that his sister Maimuna Begum aged about eighteen years was married with accused petitioner no.1 Osman Goni and after marriage she was staying in her conjugal home. On 09-02-1996 at 8:00 a.m. he came to learn that his sister committed suicide by taking poison. He further alleged that her accused husband used to torture her for money and he had complicity for causing murder of his sister.<br/><br/>On receipt of such information Police recorded the same as unnatural death case no.01 dated 10-02-1996. The Police after investigation submitted final report in the said case.<br/><br/>Eventually, on the basis of a narajee petition filed by the informant the case was further investigated by the CID Police and according to its report Companigonj P.S. Case no. 04 dated 06-02-2003 under Section 306 of the Penal Code was recorded.<br/><br/>The Police investigated the case and ultimately submitted charge-sheet on 27-12-2003 under Section 306 of the Penal Code accusing the petitioners as accused. Thereafter the case was taken up by the learned Special Sessions Judge for trial who by the impugned order dated 13-09-2005 framed charge under Sections 302, 201 of the Penal Code, against the accused.<br/><br/>Feeling aggrieved the petitioners preferred the instant application and obtained the present Rule.<br/><br/>No one appears on behalf of the petitioner to support the Rule. In view of the facts, this is an old revision of 2005, we are inclined to take it up for disposal on merit considering the materials on record.<br/><br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the State-opposite party opposes the Rule and submits that after considering the materials on record the learned Judge of the Court below rightly framed charge against the petitioners which calls for no interference by this Court.<br/><br/>In order to appreciate her submissions we have gone through the record and given our anxious consideration to her submissions.<br/> <br/><em>W</em><em>e should bear in mind, credibility of testimony oral and circumstantial, depends considerably on a judicial evaluation of the totality, not isolated scrutiny. When dealing with the serious question of guilt or innocence of persons charged with crime, the following principles should be taken into consideration. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>a) The onus of proving everything essential to the establishment of the charge against the accused lies on the prosecutor.</em><br/><em>b) The evidence must be such asto exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.</em><br/><em>c)  In matters of doubt it is safer to acquit than to condemn, for it is better that several guilty persons should escape than that one innocent person suffer.</em><br/><em>d) There must be clear and unequivocal proof of the corpus delicit.</em><br/><em>e) The hypothesis of delinquency should be consistent with all the facts proved.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Inspite of the presumption of truth attached to oral evidence under oath if the Court is not satisfied, the evidence inspite of oath is of no avail.<br/><br/>A "Charge" corresponds to an "indictment" in English Law and is very much more than a mere form. It is a precise formulation of specific accusation made against a person. Charge has to be framed on the basis of the material placed before the Trial Court and while doing so the Court is not bound by the inquiry report submitted under section 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or in a Police challan case by the report submitted under section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/><br/>A charge is an important step in a criminal proceeding. It separates the inquiry stage from trial. The whole object of framing a charge is to enable the defence to concentrate its attention on the case that he has to meet, and if charge is framed in such a vague manner that the necessary ingredients of the offence with which the accused is convicted are not brought out in the charge, then the charge is defective. The framing of a proper charge is vital to a criminal trial and this is a matter on which the Magistrate or Judge should bestow the most careful attention. A charge should be carefully drawn up in accordance with the offence disclosed. The charge should be precise in its scope and particular in its details. A charge is defined as a ‘precise formulation of the specific accusation made against a person who is entitled to know its nature at the very earliest stage. The necessity of a system of written accusation specifying a definite criminal offence is the essence of criminal procedure.<br/><br/>The charge-sheet to which the accused is called upon to plead is a very important document. It should be drawn up and considered with extreme care and caution, so that accused may have no doubt whatever as to the offences to which he is called upon to answer and the Judge of the Appellate Court also may have no doubt upon the matter. The word ‘Ground’ means basis, foundation or valid reason. The whole object of framing a charge is to enable the defence to concentrate its attention on the case that he has to meet. Conditions for framing of a charge are (i) presumption of the commission of an offence on the materials before the Court and (ii) offences triable exclusively by a competent Court.<br/><br/>On going to the materials on record it transpires that the informant aswellas investigating authority categorically narrated the manner of causing death of the victim. The learned Judge after considering the entire materials on record rightly framed charge under Sections 302, 201 of the Penal Code against the petitioners. All that is required at the stage of framing charge is to see whether the prima-facie case regarding commission of certain offence is made out. The truth veracity and effect of evidence which prosecution proposes to adduce at the time is not to be meticulously judged at the stage of framing charge. In the instant case the accused stand indicted for offence punishable under Sections 302, 201 of the Penal Code. Cognizance has been taken under the said sections. We have meticulously examined the allegations made by the informant and we find that the offence punishable under Sections 302, 201 of the Penal Code have been clearly disclosed in the instant case. We have gone through the grounds taken in the petition of Revision and we find that such grounds are absolutely the disputed question of facts and the same should be decided at trial. The plea of the petitioners are nothing but the defence plea. Be that as it may the proposition of law is now well settled that on the basis of defence plea or materials the criminal proceedings should not be stifled before trial; when there is a prima-facie case for going for trial. In view of such facts the grounds taken in the petition of revision is not the correct exposition of law. Moreso interruption of the course of Justice will set up a wrong precedent by which the course of justice instead of being advanced readily been stifled inasmuchas the grounds advanced before us are not correct or legal exposition of law. Therefore we hold that there are sufficient grounds for proceeding against the petitioners for going for trial under sections 302, 201 of the Penal Code. To that end in view we are at one with the learned Judge of the Court below regarding framing of charge against the petitioners. In view of the above we failed to discover any merit in this Rule. Thus the Rule having no merit fails.<br/><br/>In view of foregoing narrative the Rule is discharged. The order or stay granted earlier stands vacated.<br/><br/>Office is directed to communicate the order at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Rezaul Hasan, J.</strong></span></u><br/> <br/>This Rule under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) has been issued at the instance of the plaintiff-petitioner calling upon the opposite party Nos.1-3 to show cause as to why the judgment and order dated 30.5.2010 (decree signed on 7.6.2010) passed by the learned Additional District Judge, 6<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka, in Title Appeal No.274 of 2009 allowing the appeal and reversing the judgment and order dated 01.06.2009 (decree signed on 8.6.2009) passed by the learned Assistant Judge, 8<sup>th</sup> Court, Dohar, Dhaka, in Title Suit No.4007 of 2008, thereby dismissing the suit, should not be set aside or such other order be passed this court may seem fit and proper.<br/><br/>Facts, in short, for the disposal of the Rule are that the petitioner Mst. Kamran Nessa has filed Title Suit No.4007 of 2008 on 10.7.2008 against the opposite parties, being defendant Nos.1, 2 and 3 in the said suit, before the court of learned District Judge, Dhaka, as by that time the central filing system has been introduced. The said suit was transferred to the learned court of Assistant Judge, Dohar Court, Dhaka. In the plaint it has been stated that, the suit property, described in the schedule, was transferred to the plaintiff (petitioner) by a sale deed executed on 9.12.1971 and registered on 18.1.1972, as deed No.314; that her husband Alhaj Faizuddin died on 16.2.1982, leaving 4 sons namely (1) Haji Kamaluddin (ii) Haji Hafez Sharif Uddin (defendant-1) (iii)  Haji Taizuddin and (iv)Haji Md. Nasir Uddin and 3 daughters, namely (I) Kaniz Fatema (ii) Mst. Anessa Khatoon and (iii) Raisa Khatoon and all  heirs of the deceased had become successors to the property of the deceased Faizuddin; that in the last part of the year 1994, the defendant No.1 brought a written paper before the plaintiff and told that her signature was required for the purpose of business and the plaintiff, having concern about the welfare and prosperity in the  life of  her son, had signed that document at the request of defendant No.1 (her second son), but the contents of the said deed was neither read over nor explained to her, and, as such, she had signed the document on good faith; that thereafter the defendant No.1 had got the suit land mutated in his own name on the basis of that deed and has also secured other documents showing him as owner of the suit property; that from the local revenue  office she  came to learn that the suit property, that also  includes a residential building, was stated to have been orally gifted by her on 1.11.1994 to the defendant No.1 and that she had accordingly executed an affidavit on 10.12.1994, recording the fact of making the oral gift, in presence of 3 witnesses and of a  notary public who has attested the said affidavit; that the plaintiff had never made any oral gift on 1.11.1994 in favour of defendant No.1, as recorded in the said affidavit dated 10.12.1994, and that she never went to the office of the notary public, however, she has put her signature below the affidavit without knowing about the contents of the said affidavit; that there was no question of making oral gift of entire property to defendant No.1, as because she has other children too; that in the residential building of the suit property her son Md. Hafez Farid Uddin (defendant No.1) and her widowed daughter Anisa Khatoon along with her two sons are living with her; that the affidavit dated 10.12.1994, in which signature of the plaintiff  was obtained, was prepared by the defendant No.1 and got signed by her  taking advantage of her weakness, love and affection to her son, that the said affidavit 10.12.1994 is nothing but a paper transaction and is collusive one; that all the documents that are prepared in the name of the Defendant No.1, pursuant to Mutation Case No.3999/94/95 and Jamabagh Case No.15 of 2005 dated 31.7.2005 are all voidable and that the conduct of the defendant, in procuring those documents, comes within the scope of committing fraud; hence all those documents are liable to be treated as illegal and void; that in order to perpetuate the ill  design to grasp  the entire property the defendant No.1 has subsequently created a register gift deed No.5315, dated 30.12.2004, in favour of his 2(two) sons, namely Md. Zaki Uddin, who are defendant Nos. 2 and 3; that the cause of action for filing the suit has arose on 10.12.1994 when the aforesaid affidavit was created and thereafter on 31.7.2005 when the defendant No.1 got the suit properties mutated in his name pursuant to the Mutation Case No.3999/94-95-Namjari-Jamabagh Case No.15 of 2005 and was claiming exclusive ownership in the suit property by asking the plaintiff and other successors to leave the suit property and, thereafter, in the month of September, 2003, when the plaintiff- petitioner went to Land Development Tax Office to pay Khazna and came to know about procuring  of this affidavit, the mutation khatian, <em>Mohanagor khatian,</em> mutation with the Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) in the name of the defendant No.1, and finally in May 2008, because the defendant No.1, by assuring her that the matter would be  settled amicably, but for finally refusing to settle. The plaintiff has valued the suit at Tk.1000/- and paid fix court fees and prayed for relief to declare the aforesaid affidavit dated 10.12.1994 as void and that all the documents that was prepared pursuant to Namjari and jamabah Case No.15 of 2005 to be declared void. The plaintiff has further prayed that the deed of gift No.5315 dated 30.12.2008, executed by defendant No.1 in favour of his sons defendant Nos. 2 and 3, should also be declared void and she has also prayed for permanent injunction not to disturb her possession in the suit property.<br/><br/>The defendant Nos. 1, 2 and 3 have filed a joint written statement alleging, amongst other that the defendants have contested the suit by filing written statement denying all the material allegations brought against them and contending inter alia;</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;">that the suit is not maintainable in its present form and the suit is barred by law of limitation . The defendants thereafter stated that the disputed house was bought in the name of the successors of Hazi Fayez Uddin. Thereafter the death of Hazi Foyez Uddin, the successors amicably made a partition deed through Notary public wherein the plaintiff got the disputed house along with other peroperty;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">that thereafter the plaintiff charmed with natural love and affection gifted the suit land to his son i.e defendant No.1 in front of notary public through registered affidavit deed No.30 dated 30.12.1994. The defendant No.1 therefore got his name mutated through namjari case No.3999/94-95 and enjoyed the suit land by way of tenancy;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">that whenever the defendant went to mutate his name in city corporation, the plaintiff was informed the matter through notice and the plaintiff thereafter in front of Kamal Uddin Kabul i.e. Ward Commissioner No.64 issued a No Objection Letter dated on 09.09.1995. Thereafter the defendant No.1 mutated his name and paid rent, tax accordingly;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">that therefore, the Dhaka City Survey was recorded in the name of defendant No.1. The plaintiff informed the Deputy Taxes Commissioner, Circle 20 abut the gift and paid the income tax without the disputed house in the income tax statement. The TIN No. of the plaintiff is 051-1000-5218/sa-20. Thereafter the other sons and daughter became aggrieved about the gift and pressurized the plaintiff to file a Misc. Case No.7003 against the namjari and joma bhag case No.3999/94-95. Thereafter the plaintiff understood the conspiracy of her other children withdrew the misc. case voluntarily and thus the Assistant Commissioner (Land confirmed the namjari case No. 3999/94-95;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">that thereafter the defendant on 30.12.2004 gifted the suit land to the defendant Nos. 2 and 3 through registered Heba deed NO.5315. Thereafter the defendant Nos. 2 and 3 got their name mutated through Namjari and Joma Bhag Case No.1505 dated 31.07.2005 and paid rent accordingly;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">that the plaintiff due to pressure from other children have filed this suit. The defendants claimed that the plaintiff has no prima-facie arguable case and thus they have prayed for dismissal of the suit.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">That the learned Senior Assistant Judge, Dohar, Dhaka after hearing both the parties decreed the suit by its judgment and decree dated 01.06.2009 (decree signed on 08.06.2009) in Title Suit No.4007 of 2008.<br/><br/>That against the judgment and decree passed by the trial court the defendant as appellants preferred Title Appeal No.274 of 2009 before the learned District Judge, Dhaka, on transfer the same was herd by the learned Additional District Judge, 6<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka who by its judgment and decree dated 30.05.2010 (decree drawn on 07.06.2010) allowed the appeal and reversed the judgment and decree of the trial court.<br/><br/>That being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and decree of the Court of appeal below the plaintiff-petitioner preferred this revisional application under Section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure before this Hon’ble Court Division on the following amongst other.<br/><br/>The petition filed under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, being moved as a motion, this court has issued the Rule mentioned above.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Mahbubey Alam, appearing alongwith the learned Advocate Mr. Md. Harun-or-Rashid, having placed the petition and the documents lying with the lower court record, first of all submits that the Appellate Court below has utterly failed to the appreciate the evidence on record. It has failed to notice that the plaintiff, being P.W.1, herself appeared before the court and denied to have made any oral gift on 1.11.1994 or to have signed the affidavit dated 10.12.1994. He further submits that P.W.1 has also deposed in her examination and in the course of her cross-examination that she has other children and she had no intention to make any gift in favour of his one son only by excluding other children. The P.W.1 has further deposed that she is possessing the suit property alongwith the residential building. Next, drawing my attention to the certified copy of  a registered partition deed No.2922 dated 20.10.1998, (Ext.8) the learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that, very unfortunately, neither the lower court nor the appellate court has sufficiently discussed this registered partition deed signed in the year 1998 by all heirs of late Faizuddin that clearly proves that no  oral gift was made in the year 1.11.1994 and no question to sign any affidavit, on 10.12.1994,to confirm the oral gift by the petitioner did arise. Then referring to the judgments of the appellate court, the learned Advocate further submits that the appellate court, as the last court of facts, has utterly failed to appreciate that, since a deed of partition was executed and registered in the year 2008, in which the defendant No.2 is also a signatory, there is no need to seek any  relief for cancellation of the affidavit (<em>halfnama</em>) dated 10.12.1994 inasmuch as by virtue of the subsequent deed of  partition, registered in the year 2008, the  affidavit dated 10.12.1994 has become ineffective and non existent in the eye of law. Moreover, this registered deed of partition dated 20.10.2008 also proves that the oral gift, even if there was any, was never acted upon. Besides, he further submits that, the signature in the impugned affidavit in written as……………“কামরুন নেসা” whereas in the “আপত্তিহীন সনদপত্র” it appears as “ কামরান নেসা।” As such, he adds, the  genuineness of the affidavit dated 10.12.1994 has been rightly questioned. He, next, submits that the appellate court ought not to have relied upon the  evidence of the defence witnesses, because the defendant No.1 himself did not appear before this court. Whereas, the other defendants are not neutral witnesses. As such, he continues, the defendants could not prove  their positive case stated in the written statement. As regards the lower court’s finding that the suit was barred by limitation, the learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that in fact the plaintiff has claimed to have learnt about this <em>halfnama </em>in the year  2003, as stated in paragraph No.10 of the plaint, when she went to the Land Development Tax office for the purpose of  payment of <em>Khazna</em>. Thereafter, the defendants, assuring the plaintiff that they would settle the dispute amicably, had dragged the matter and finally refused to settle the matter in May, 2008. So the cause of action has arisen in the year 2008. As such, the suit has been filed  on 10.7.2008, i.e. within the period of 6(six) years limitation from May, 2008. But the learned Appellate Court, without at all taking into notice these material facts and circumstances, has passed the impugned judgment and decree reversing the judgment passed by the trial court, by which the suit was allowed, and thereby the Appellate Court has committed error of law resulting in an error in the decision and that has occasioned failure of justice in this case. Accordingly, he has prayed that the Rule issued in this case may be made absolute.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate Mr. A. F. M. Mesbahuddin, appearing along with the learned Advocate Mr. Md. Zakir Hossain, on the other hand, having placed the petition alongwith the materials on record, for the opposite parties, submits that the appellate court, being the last court of facts, the findings of the appellate court can not be lightly interfered with and it is the trend of  decisions of this court. He further submits that a mere perusal of the trial court judgment would  prima-facie show that the trial court, when the passed the judgment dated 01.06.2009 in Title Suit No.4007 of 2008,  did not discuss any evidence of the P.Ws (the plaintiff’s witnesses) or of the D.Ws(defendant’s witnesses), with specific reference to their deposition or to the documents exhibited in the suit and had arrived at wrong findings regarding the issues framed by the said court. The trial court, in passing it’s judgment and decree, had not applied its mind judiciously to the facts and circumstances of this case, it has utterly failed to appreciate the evidence on record and has failed to arrive at correct findings on the issues framed. On the contrary, he submits, that a plain reading of the judgment passed by the appellate court evidently shows that the learned Judge of the Appellate Court has discussed the deposition of each  witnesses of the plaintiff (P.W) and of each defence witness (D.W.) as well as it has examined all the exhibits meticulously and  judiciously and the judgment passed by the Appellate Court is apparently based on proper appreciation of evidence on record. The appellate court, he continues, has reversed the findings of the trial court upon proper appreciation of the evidence, both oral and documentary, as will be apparent from the materials on record and the judgment and decree of the Appellate is in clear consonance with the provisions of law. Next, referring to the deposition of P.W.2 Hazi Amir Hossain, who is the son in law of the plaintiff, has admitted the fact of making oral partition in 1994. During his cross-examination that “ আমি ব্যাবসা করি। ব্যাবসা প্রতিষ্ঠানের নাম হোসেন ট্রেডাস। হোসেন আমার পুত্র। আগে ব্যাবসাটা আমার শুশুরবাড়ির সাথে Joint ছিল. ১৯৯৪ সালে বন্টন হওয়ার পর পৃথক হই।” He has also admitted that ‘‘ আমার প্রদত্ত হলফ নামায় (প্রদঃ-১০) এবং ১০/০১/১৯৯৪ ইং তারিখের স্বাক্ষর এক হতে পারে|’’ As such,  this P.W.2 admits that there was an oral partition in the year 1994, pursuant to which he has separated  his joint business that was previously being done with his father-in- laws family and he has also  admitted to have made signature on the affidavit dated 10.2.1994, when his attention was drawn, to his admitted signature. The learned advocate also submits that, P.W.3,  Amir Hossain, has straight way  admitted during his cross-examination  that, “১০/১২/১৯৯৪ ইং তারিখের হলফনামার ৩নং স্বাক্ষর আমার| ’’ But, neither the PW.2 nor P.W.3, nor any other PWs, had deposed that the partition of the suit properties was effected by any deed of partition in the year 1988. He also submits P.W.4 , Haji Kamal, a neighbor of the parties and local commissioner, acquainted to  the parties deposed that “ এই অনাপত্তি নামায় আমার স্বাক্ষর আছে, কিন্তু আমি সরল বিশ্বাসে স্বাক্ষর করি। ”.As such this P.W 4 has also admitted that he had put his signature on a document “ আপত্তিহীন সনদপত্র।” On 09.09.1995 signed by the plaintiff for the purpose of mutation of the suit property  in the name of defendant No.1 by striking out her name. This P.W.4 did not refer exclusively to the request made by the defendant No.1., but the asserts that the request was made by the family members of the plaintiff.  As such, he submits that, evidently the fact of swearing and signing the affidavit on 12.12.1994 by the plaintiff/ P.W. 1, recording the oral gift made on 1.11.1994, has been proved by P.W.3 in clear language and P.W. 2 has admitted that his admitted signature (exhibit-10/1) has similarly with the signature appearing in the affidavit dated 10.12.1994  (exhibit-Kha). Both these P.W.2, nor the P.W.3 are witnesses to the affidavit dated 10.12.94, while another witness named Muhammad Ahammad Khan was  not alive at the time of hearing of the suit. Next referring to the deposition of  P.W.5 Md. Nasiruddin, son of the plaintiff/P.W.1, he submits that, in his deposition P.W.5 has simply states that the suit property was purchased by his father in the name of his mother i.e. in the <em>benami </em>of her <em>mother.</em> After death of his father the suit property, including other properties, was partitioned amongst his mother and the brothers and sisters. In paragraph No.3 of the plaint, it has been stated that husband of the plaintiff, died in the year 1992. As such, as per deposition of P.W.5, the suit property and other properties left by his deceased father was partitioned amongst the family members after death of his father i.e. some time after 16.12.1982. This P.W.5 also does not state that the property was partitioned by any registered deed in the year 1998, although he himself is a signatory to that deed. P.W.6, Anisa Khatoon, is daughter of the plaintiff/ P.W. She is an widow and deposed that she  in stays a flat on the suit land alongwith her two sons,  and she has deposed in examination chief, regarding the oral gift, that “আমার মা কখনই এই বিষয়ে আমার সাথে আলোচনা করে নাই। ” As such, the deposition of this P.W also does not in any way support the case of the plaintiff- petitioner, the learned Advocate submits. On the contrary, the defence case has been consistently supported by all the defence witnesses i.e. by D.W.1 to D.W.5, as has been elaborately discussed in the judgment passed by the appellate court, as the last court of  facts. The defendant No.1 did not appear in this case for obvious reason, he explains, that this is a suit between the mother and son and there was reason for feeling embarrassment by the defendant No.1 to personally appear in this case. This does not in any way cast any doubt to the deposition made by the defence witnesses or on the defence case, inasmuch as the defence witness, as a whole, is consistent, elaborate and there is no contradiction amongst their deposition. The learned Appellate Court has, therefore, he concludes, has recorded   his findings on facts based on deposition of these witnesses and on law. The trial court has failed to appreciate that the suit was barred by limitation and that the suit was not maintainable for not seeking cancellation of the impugned deeds and the appellate court has, therefore, rightly reversed the findings of the court below on point of facts and law. As such, the findings of the appellate court does not suffer from any perversity or misreading or non-reading of evidence or misconstruction of law and the same does not call for any interference by this court. Hence he has prayed for discharging the rule.<br/><br/>Heard the learned Advocates, perused the petition alongwith the judgments of the courts below and have examined the evidence and other materials on record.<br/><br/>The issue before this court is to consider whether the appellate court has committed any error law resulting in any error in the decision occasioning failure of justice in passing the impugned  judgment and order dated 30.5.2010 (decree signed on 7.6.2010) in Title Appeal No.274 of 2009.  <br/> <br/>To arrive at the conclusion, I have taken for consideration the judgment passed by the appellate court.<br/><br/>In it’s judgment the appellate court has framed the following issues, namely (1) whether the judgment and decree passed by the learned court below is liable to be reversed and set aside and (ii) whether the appellant (plaintiff) is entitled to get the relief as prayed for.<br/><br/>To arrive at my findings on the said issues, I have taken for considering the judgment dated 30.5.2010, of the appellate court, for consideration. I find that  under the heading ‘‘ আলোচনা ও wm×vš—ÕÕ the appellate court has recorded that admittedly Kamran Nessa, the plaintiff, was owner of the suit property. The suit has been brought for declaring void the affidavit  dated 10.12.1994. The trial court by its judgment and order dated 10.12.1994 has declared the said affidavit dated 10.12.1994 void and not binding on the plaintiff. Hence the defendant-appellant has filed this appeal against the said judgment stating 7 grounds in the Appeal Memo, for setting aside   the said judgment. In the appeal memo, the appellant has stated that there is no cause of action for filing the suit for the reason, that no specific date of acquiring knowledge about the impugned affidavit has been mentioned in the plaintiff and that the trial court has erred in passing the judgment and order because of misconception on the issues involved and has also failed to appreciate that the suit was barred by limitation and on the principle of estoppeal. It has also been stated that in the Appeal Memo that from the return of income tax and the documents relating to the mutation it was further apparent that the plaintiff  Kamran Nessa has gifted the suit property in favour of her son  defendant No.1, and that the suit property was not shown in the  income tax return filed related to their joint property, after the oral gift was made. Mutation has been done and mutation khatian has been recorded in favour of the defendant No.1 pursuant to the said oral gift made in the year 1994. In <em>Mahanagar jarip</em> (Mahanagar survey) name of the plaintiff has been duly recorded as possessor and owner of the suit property.<br/><br/>Thereafter, I also do find that the appellate court has discussed the evidence of the prosecution witnesses of the plaintiff  and records that inspite of the  P.W.2 and 3 having supported the affidavit and the P.W.4 having supported the  title and possession of the defendant in the suit property,  the lower court has failed to appreciate their evidence and arrived at findings contrary to the evidences on record. The plaintiff Kamran Nessa, as P.W.1, has admitted to have signed the affidavit and helped in getting  mutation of the suit property in the name of the defendant No.1. She did not raise any objection in recording this suit property in the name of the donee in the income tax return of defendant No.1. The  P.W.4 deposed to have assisted to get mutation of suit property in the name of defendant No.1, with consent of all parties. The defendant No.1 subsequently gifted the suit property in favour of defendant Nos. 2 and 3. But, even after knowing about this registered gift deed the plaintiff has simply filed  a suit for declaration instead of filling a suit for cancellation of the registered deed of gift made by the defendant No.1 infavour of the defendants No.2 and No.3. As such, the suit is not maintainable in its present form. Next, referring to the cores-examination of defendant No.1, the learned appellate court records that, from the evidence on record, it appears that the defendants are maintaining title and possession in the suit property. The P.W.2 has indirectly admitted  in his cross-examination that on  10.12.1994 he had  signed in the affidavit as a witness and that the defendant No.1 is in possession of the suit property. P.W.3, in his cross-examination, has admitted that he has signed below the affidavit dated 10.12.1994 as a witness and that defendant No.1 is living in the suit property. P.W.4, Haji Kamaluddin, Commissioner, in his deposition, stated that he has signed the ‘no objection certificate’. The D.W.2 deposed that the suit property was gifted  by the defendant Nos.1 to his two sons and that  the defendants are in possession of the suit property through their tenants.  D.W.3, Anwar Hossain, deposed    that Kamran Nessa was owner  of the suit property and subsequently, in the year 1994, she has gifted the suit land to his son (defendant No.1). The D.W.4,  in his deposition, has also stated that the defendants are in possession of the suit land through their tenants. The D.W.5, Caretaker of the suit property, in his deposition,  stated that from  1988 to 1994 he was serving as an employee of Kamranness and that in 1994 the property was gifted by  her to her son (defendant No.1), and that he (D.W.5) is   serving   as an employee of defendant No.1 since 1994.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the appellate court, as apparent in it’s judgment, having considered the deposition of the witnesses, has arrived at independent findings that the defendants are maintaining their title and possession in the suit property by duly getting their name mutated in respect of the suit property and on payment of land development taxes (Khajna) and income taxes etc. Appellate court has also recorded in it’s judgment that before the trial court the plaintiff has not mentioned any specific date on which she has come to know about the affidavit dated 10.12.1994, but she has filed the suit on 10.7.2008. As such the suit was clearly barred by limitation, but the trial court has not given proper decision on that issue. On the issue of estoppel, the appellate court holds that inspite of the plaintiff having complied with all formalities pursuant to the oral gift and the witnesses to the affidavit, who are alive, having deposed that the defendant is in possession of the suit property through his tenants, therefore, the suit was not maintainable without prayer for decree for  cancellation of the gift deed, as per provision of section 39 of the Special Relief Act, 1877, and for recovery of khas possession, but the trial court has failed to appreciate this. He also holds that in this case advolerume court fees ought to have been paid on proper valuation of the suit. The learned trial court, he records, have found that  offer and acceptance in respect of the gift was in favour of the defendant and has also recorded that the defendant was in possession of the suit land before 10.12.1994. Then referring  to the power of attorney (Ext. Ka) to the affidavit recording  oral gift (Ext. Kha), to Ext. Ga series, namely the DCR and land development taxes receipts, to Ext. Gha khatians (record of rights),  to  Ext. ‘Uma’- certified copy of the objection Miscellaneous Case No.70 of 2003 filed before the Assistant Commissioner  (Land), Dhanmondi Revenue Circle, to (Ext. Cha)-land development tax receipts etc, the appellate court has arrived at the finding that the suit property is in  possession of the defendant and that they are maintaining possession on payment of taxes and <em>Khazna</em> in respect of the suit properties. Referring to (Ext.8), a register deed of partition of 2008, the learned appellate court records that it appears from Ext. 8 that there were a huge properties left by deceased husband of the plaintiff and that have been partitioned long back amongst the successors of the deceased Faizuddin .  He also holds that  since the suit property was transferred to the defendant No.1 through gift and plaintiff herself has assisted in doing the necessary formalities pursuant to the gift, as recorded in affidavit dated 10.12.1994, it is admitted by both sides that the gist was made and the  oral  gift was recorded long before 2008 and the defendant was recovering rents from the tenants residing/using the suit properties. But, the learned Court below, without discussing the evidences of the witnesses in detail or specifically, has declared void the affidavit dated 10.12.1994, although the defendant has been able to prove their case. Accordingly, he has allowed the   appeal against the contesting respondents, without any order as to cost and has reverse  set-aside the judgment and order dated 01.06.2009, passed by the court below (the decree signed on 8.6.2009).<br/><br/>In the light of the findings of the appellate court, I have considered the judgment and decree passed by the trial court. I find that the learned trial court, in arriving at her findings, had neither specifically referred to, nor had discussed, in it’s judgment,  the evidence of the plaintiff’s witnesses (P.Ws) or of the defendant’s witnesses (D.Ws) or to the documents proved in the course of trial. Whereas, I find that, the appellate court has, in his judgment, specifically referred to and discussed the entire deposition on record as well as the documentary evidence, marked  as exhibits, in arriving at his findings  on the  issues of law and of facts, and has passed the judgment based upon the independent findings arrived at by him and upon proper appreciation of the evidence on record.<br/><br/>The trend of decisions of this court, as the learned advocate for the opposite-parties submits, is that the appellate court, being the last court of facts, the findings of the appellate court should not be lightly interfered with. The appellate court, I find that, has reversed the findings of the trial court upon proper appreciation of the evidence, both oral and documentary, as will be apparent from the materials on record. I also find that the judgment  of the Appellate Court is in clear consonance with the provisions of law.  Next, having examined the deposition of the witnesses and the documents exhibited, I find that P.W.2, Hazi Amir Hossain, who is the son in law of the plaintiff, has admitted the fact of making oral partition in 1994. During his cross-examination he admits that “ আমি ব্যাবসা করি। ব্যাবসা প্রতিষ্ঠানের নাম হোসেন ট্রেডাস। হোসেন আমার পুত্র। আগে ব্যাবসাটা আমার শুশুরবাড়ির সাথে joint ছিল। ১৯৯৪ সালে বন্টন হওয়ার পর পৃথক হই” He has also admitted that ‘‘ আমার প্রদত্ত হলফ নামায় (প্রদঃ-১০) এবং ১০/০১/১৯৯৪ ইং তারিখের স্বাক্ষর এক হতে পারে। ’’As such,  this P.W.2 admits that there was an oral partition in the year 1994 pursuant to which he has separated  his joint business that was earlier done jointly with his father-in- laws family and he has also  admitted to have made signature on the affidavit dated 10.2.1994, when his attention was drawn, to his admitted signature. This P.W.2 is one of the 3 witnesses to the affidavit dated 10.2.1994 (exhibit-Kha). The P.W.3,  Amir Hossain, has straight way  admitted during his cross-examination  that, “১০/১২/১৯৯৪ ইং তারিখের হলফনামার ৩নং স্বাক্ষর আমার|’’  Neither this PW.2, nor the P.W.3 nor any other PWs had deposed that the oral partition of 1993, as recorded in the notorised affidavit dated 10.11.1993, recording the oral partition, was not acted upon or that the  partition of the suit properties was effected by any deed of partition in the year 1988. I also find that the P.W.4 , Haji Kamal,, a neighbor of the parties and local commissioner, acquainted to  the parties, deposed that “এই অনাপত্তি নামায় আমার স্বাক্ষর আছে, কিন্তু আমি সরল বিশ্বাসে স্বাক্ষর করি| ”.As such this P.W 4.has also admitted that he had put his signature on a document “আপত্তিহীন সনদপত্র” on 09.09.1995, that had been signed by the plaintiff for the purpose of mutation of the suit property  in the name of defendant No.1 by striking out her name and this admission also proves the oral gift made in the meantime, in 1994. This P.W.4 did not refer exclusively to the request made by the defendant No.1, but he asserts that the request was made by the family members of the plaintiff.  As such,  I find that  the fact of swearing and signing the affidavit on 12.12.1994 by the plaintiff/ P.W. 1, recording the oral gift made on 1.11.1994, has been proved by P.W.3, in clear language, in his deposition and also the P.W. 2 has admitted, in his deposition, that his admitted signature (exhibit-10/1) has similarity with his signature appearing in the affidavit dated 10.12.1994  (exhibit-Kha). Both these P.W.2 and the P.W.3 are witnesses to the affidavit dated 10.12.94, while another witness named Muhammad Ahammad Khan was  not alive at the time of hearing of the suit. Next, referring to the deposition of P.W.5 Md. Nasiruddin, son of the plaintiff/P.W.1, I find that, in his deposition P.W.5 has simply stated that the suit property was purchased by his father in the name of his mother i.e. in the <em>benami </em>of her <em>mother.</em> After death of his father the suit property, including other properties, was partitioned amongst the heirs of the deceased Faizuddin late husband of the plaintiff. In paragraph No.3 of the plaint, it has been stated that husband of the plaintiff, died in the year 1992. As such, according to the deposition of P.W.5, the suit property and other properties left by his deceased father was partitioned amongst the family members after death of his father i.e. some time after 16.12.1982. This P.W.5 also does not state that the property was partitioned by any registered deed in the year 1998, although he himself is a signatory to that deed. The P.W.6, Anisa Khatoon, daughter of the plaintiff, simply deposed, in examination chief, regarding the oral gift, that “আমার মা কখনই এই বিষয়ে আমার সাথে আলোচনা করে নাই। ” Therefore, the deposition of this P.W also does not in any way support the case of the plaintiff- petitioner. I find, on the contrary, the defence case has been consistently supported by all the defence witnesses i.e. by D.W.1 to D.W.5, as has been elaborately discussed in the judgment passed by the appellate court, as the last court of facts. I also find substance in the submission of the learned advocate for the opposite parties that,non-appearance of the defendant No.1  does not in any way cast any doubt to the deposition made by the defence version, or on the defence case, inasmuch as the defence witness, as a whole is consistant, elaborate and there is no contradiction amongst their deposition.<br/><br/>I have also taken into notice that, the D.W.1, Md. Zakir Uddin, has elaborately and specifically stated the defence case and proved the case of defendant No.1. He has proved the affidavit dated 10.12.94, the DCR and all documents relating to mutation, khatians, khajna Dhakilas in the name of the defendant No.1. as well as the mutation with the DCC, the orders dated 30.9.2003 to 09.2.2003 of the A.C (Land), Dhanmondi Revenue Circle, Dhaka, whereby the Misc. Case No.70 of 2003 initiated by the plaintiff, challenging the mutation, was withdrawn, the documents relating to mutation in the name of defendants No.2 and 3 and the <em>Khajna</em> <em>Dhakila</em>, pursuant to the gift made in their favour by defendant No1, by proving the original gift deed No.5315 dated 30.12.2004. All these documents are marked as exhibits ‘Ka’ to exhibit ‘Cha’ series and the documents exhibited on behalf of the plaintiff are marked exhibits No.1 to 11. Next, having considered the deposition of the  D.W No.2, Jalilur Rahman, and 3.Md. Selim, two  neutral  witnesses, I find they have deposed that the defendants are owners of the suit properties  and  they possess the same through their tenants. D.W. 3 is also a neighbor and living in the next door to the disputed property. The D.W.3 deposed that the plaintiff was the owner and in the year 1994 and  she had gifted the property to defendant No.1, and that the defendants are occupying and possessing the suit land along with the residential buildings through their tenants. He further deposed, in his cross-examination, that his age was about 22 years in the year 1994 when the gift was made. Nothing adverse or to  contradict these witnesses could be extracted from during their cross-examination. The D.W.4, Shamim Ahmed, is living to the north side of the disputed property. He has deposed that the suit land alongwith the residential property is in possession of the defendants and they are occupying the same through their tenants.  The D.W.5, Md. Rafiqul Islam, is the caretaker of the residential building. He, I find, is also a neutral and non-partisan witness. In his deposition he stated that the suit property earlier belonged to the plaintiff and he was serving under the plaintiff until 1994. In the year 1994 the property was gifted to the defendant No.1 and since then he is serving under defendant No.1. In his cross-examina-tion, he deposed that, since 1991 he is staying at Muradpur alongwith his family. His salary, while was serving under Kamrun Nessa, was Tk.4,000/-. His duty was to pay various utility bills. He is recently receiving Tk.5,000/- as the monthly wages. He also deposed in his cross examination that “ কামরুন নেসা ১৯৯৪ ইং সালে ১নং বিবাদীকে দান করে, তবে তারিখ মনে নাই। ঐ সময় খাজে দেওয়ান এর নিচ তলায় ছিলাম।” The D.W.2 to D.W 5 also deposed that they have received summons at their respective places and they have come to the court independently and they have not brought before this court by any parties to the suit. The have in a voice, corroborated the D.W.1 in all respect, regarding the oral gift, ownership and possession of the suit properties, as neighbours and inmates/ employee, respectively. They have personal knowledge and there is nothing on record  to  disbelieve them or to discard their deposition. I have also considered the application filed before the Assistant Commissioner of  Land  by the  plaintiff and   the orders dated 30.9.2003 to 09.12.2003, recorded in the Objection Miscellaneous  case No.70 of 2003, that was filed   by the plaintiff-petitioner in the year 2003, it as recorded by the  Assistant Commissioner in his order dated 19.12.2013 (exhibit- ‘Uma’ series). Presumption of legality is attached to these official acts as per provision of Evidence Act. Accordingly, I hold that the period of limitation, has started from the 1994 since the partition was made in the year, 1994, as admitted by the P.W.1 in ‘Uma series, and by the P.W.3 and D.W.5, whose deposition can be safely relied upon. Even if  the plaintiff’s case that she came to  know about this gift in the year 2003 were acceptable, as stated in paragraph No.10 of the plaint, then also the period of limitation starts from 2003 and a suit for cancellation of the deed of gift, as per section 39 of the S.R.Act  ought to have been filed   within 3 years from 2003,  as required by section 91 of the Limitation Act. For this reason alone,  the suit is hopelessly the barred by limitation. Besides, the submission of the learned advocate of the plaintiff-petitioner that her signature appears as “কামরুন নেসা ” in the affidavit dated 10.12.1994 (exhibit-Kha), but her signatures in the “আপত্তিহীন সনদপত্র” appears as “কামরান নেসা ”  does not have any substance. Because, the plaintiff herself admits to have signed the said affidavit and, 2ndly, she has signed below her deposition, as P.W.1, as “কামরান নেসা ”<br/><br/>To summarise, I record that,  by P.W.4, Md. Kamaluddin admitted his  making  recommendation alongwith signature on 9.9.1995  on a no objection certificate, wherein the plaintiff Kamrunnessa has stated that she has no objection if the suit properties are recorded in the name of his son Hafez Md. Sharif Uddin (defendant No.1),  in the place of  her name in respect of the suit properties. This no objection certificate, bearing signature of P.W.4 with his recommendation made on 9.9.1995, ought to have been marked as exhibit, as admitted by him in his deposition before the trial court. As to the registered deed of partition No.2922 dated 20.10.1998 (Ext-8), I  find that  the P.W.3 (witness to the affidavit) has clearly  deposed that he has signed the affidavit dated 10.12.194 as one of the wtnessess. The P.W.2, another witness to the affidavit, has also admitted that his signature made on the affidavit dated 10.12.1994 is similar to his admitted signature (exhibit-10/1). I also find that in an unregistered partition deed dated 10.11.1993 i.e. “আপোষ বন্টননামা দলিল ।” The fact of oral partition, amongst all the heirs of deceased Faizuddin, has been put into record. This <em>aposhbantannama</em> deed, containing schedule ‘Ka’ to ‘Cha’ has been signed by all  heirs of the late alhaj Faizuddin, and their signatures have been duly verified and authenticated by a Notary Public on the same date of execution. This notarized deed of partition is a   memorandum showing that  an oral partition was made after death of Faizuddin on 16.12.1982, as admitted by  P.W.5 (son of late Faizuddin) deposing  that the property was partitioned after the death of his father. This has been admitted by P.W.1 in her deposition, admitting that, “আমার স্বামী ১৯৮২ সনে ১৬ ডিসেমবর চার ছেলে ৩ মেয়েকে ওয়ারিশ রেখে মারা যান। ১৯৯৩ সনে আমাদের নঁংরহবংং ও সম্পত্তির ব্যাপারে বাড়িতে উকিল এনে বন্টন করায়। বন্টন নামার মূল কপি আদালতে দাখিল করিলাম (প্রদ-৭)|” All defence witness have also gave deposition that the suit property was gifted in 1994, i.e. after oral partition was made, as recorded in the notarised deed of partition of 1993 (exhibit-7). The registered partition deed No.2922 of 2008, though admitted in evidence and marked as Ext. 8,  also refers to  the same  schedules and contents of the previous notorised deed of partition dated 10.11.1993, signed by and between the same parties,  in the year 1993 and it simply confirms the previous oral partition of 1993. I am also of the view that the materials on record are adequate to dispose of this matter.<br/><br/>The subsequent registered partition deed No.2922 dated 20.10.1998 can not, in my considered opinion, nullify the previous oral partition recorded in the notorised partition deed dated 10.11.1993, submitted by the plaintiff and proved by P.W.1, marked as exhibit-7 that was permitted by law and has the legal force and was acted upon  amongst the parties, as admitted by the PW-1, in her examination-in-chief, deposing that, “আমার স্বামী ১৯৮২ সনে ১৬ ডিসেমবর চার ছেলে ৩ মেয়েকে ওয়ারিশ রেখে মারা যান। ১৯৯৩ সনে আমাদের নঁংরহবংং ও সম্পত্তির ব্যাপারে বাড়িতে উকিল এনে বন্টন করায়। বন্টন নামার মূল কপি আদালতে দাখিল করিলাম (প্রদ-৭)।”. I am also of the view that the registered partition deed No.2922 dated 20.10.1998 is nothing but a memorandum of the previous oral partition, recorded in the notarized deed of partition of the year 2003 and admitted by P.W.1 in her deposition, based on which the suit property fell into the shaham (share) of the plaintiff and she had made the oral gift of 1994. This registered partition deed of 1998, therefore, has neither created nor extinguished the right of the parties in the properties that was partitioned in year 1993. Besides, in the plaint, the plaintiff herself also did not rely on this subsequent deed of partition dated 20.10.1998 (exhibit-8) in support of her title or claim to the suit property.  Rather, in her deposition, she claims title to the suit property, based on partition of 1993. Before partition of 1993, the plaintiff claimed title on the basis of a  deed No.314 registered on 18.1.1972 (exhibit-4), as stated in paragraph No.2 of the plaint. None of the parties, I find, has claimed title to the suit or other properties of the deceased Faizuddin on the basis of this deed of partition registered in 2008 (exhibit-8). Next, having considered the affidavit dated 10.12.1994 (exhibit-Kha), in which the oral gift dated 1.11.1994 has been recorded, I find that it has been proved by P.W.3 who is a witness to the affidavit and has also admitted the fact of oral partition taking place in the year 1994, followed by consequent  partition of the joint family business as well. Similarly, P.W.2, another witness to the affidavit dated 10.12.94 has also admitted his signature in this affidavit, by admitting similarity of his signature put an this affidavit dated 10.12.1994, with that of his admitted signature (exhibit-10/1). Besides this affidavit dated 10.12.1994 (Ext.Kha) has been attested on the same date on which it was executed by the plaintiff. As such the attestation itself is a proof of execution of the affidavit by the plaintiff. Moreover, the plaintiff herself has admitted in the plaint more then once, that she has signed the affidavit dated 10.12.1994 although she states that she did not know about the contents of this affidavit. But, she however admits that she has signed it out of love and affection to her son (defendant No.1) and that she signed because she was told that her signature was required for the purpose of business. But the contention she signed this deed for the purpose of business is not supported or corroborated by any witnesses or any other materials on record. On the other hand, the learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that the petitioner no business at all and the question of signing the affidavit for the purpose of business does not arise. I find substance in his submission.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate for the petitioner, Mr. Mahbubey Alam, lastly submitted that if the suit is dismissed on technical point then the equity will be defeated and if the suit is decreed then the defendant No.1 as well as other children/ plaintiff would get their respective title after death of the plaintiff. In this respect, the court’s duty is to consider as to whether the plaintiff  has been able to prove her case by adducing required degree of proof and the submission made by the learned Advocate for the petitioner since not material for the purpose of disposal of this rule.<br/><br/>The learned trial court, though recorded in her judgment that the burden of proof the case of the plaintiff fully lies on him, has, however, failed to appreciate that the plaintiff has not been able to discharge her onus by adducing the required proof or evidence.<br/><br/>However, before parting of, I must hold that in the case of gift made between the family members, there is always a legitimate expectation from the side of the doner, as distinct from a condition or consideration for the gift, that the doner shall reside in the gifted (residential) property with the donee, as a family member. The donee is estopped to deny such legistimate expectation implicit in this kind of gift made for no consideration, but out of love, affection and concern about the welfare of the donee. Such, proposition is supported by the doctrine of ‘legitimate expectation’, application of which can be extended to secure ends of justice, in a case like this.<br/><br/><strong>For the same reason, I further hold that handing over of possession of a gifted property, gift being made between blood relations, like parent and children, does not and should not require physical evacuation of the doner or physically giving up possession of the gifted property by the doner. Handing over of possession, in such a case, can be proved by evidence like the mutation of name of the donee, opening <em>Khatian</em> in his name, payments of Khajna/ tax etc. by him, as has been done in this case. Because, in case of such a gift, made out of love, care and concern between the parties, a legitimate expection to live jointly, as family members, is supported by long prevailing custom of our society.</strong> <strong>Therefore, husband can not be expected to live separately from wife or the parents from the children or vice versa, in consequence of such type of gift.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Accordingly, I also hold that, it is legistimate expectation of the donor to reside with the donee based on their peculiar relationship as mother and son. The doner, in such case, shall be deemed to have acquired the status of licensee to reside in the suit property. Therefore, for ends of justice, the defendants Nos.1, 2 and 3 are hereby directed to maintain status quo in respect of peaceful living of the plaintiff and of her attendants, if any, in the suit property (in the ground floor, or at any other floor to be determined by the donee), during her life time. In the facts of this case, the plaintiff is estopped, it is to be confirmed as well, to deny the title and possession of the defendants in the suit of properties and she has no legal right to let out or to transfer or to enjoy the usufruct of the suit property.</strong><br/><br/>It is also to be recorded here, as to the binding character of this view, that this court, as a Constitutional Court, not only decides the lis, but also develops and declares the law, as one of its fundamental functions. This court is authorized, by Article 111 of the Constitution, to declare the law and the law declared by it is binding on all courts subordinate to it. It has been held, in the case reported in 32 BLD (AD) 2012: GOB v. Md. Mosharraf Hossain, at page 67, that “the moment High Court Division passes any judgment and order, it becomes law of the land in view of Article 111 of the Constitution, unless the same is modified or set-aside or operation of the same is stayed by the Appellate Division.” Again, in the case of Azzad Hossain v. State, reported in 62 DLR(AD) 288, page 288, at it has been held by the apex court that, any judgment passed by the High Court Division is binding on all and the sub-ordinate courts are duty bound to comply with such judgment.<br/><br/>In view of the deliberation recorded above, I am of the considered view that the findings arrived at by the appellate court, as the last court of facts, does not suffer from any perversity and that there is no misreading or misconstruction of any evidence, documentary or oral or of the provisions of law. He has, as supported by the materials on record, rightly reversed the findings of the trial court on the basis of the independent findings arrived at by him on proper appreciation of the evidence on record and reversed the judgment and decree passed by the trial court and thereby he has committed no error of law  resulting in any error in the decision  or occasioning failure of justice.<br/><br/>For the reasons aforesaid, I find no merit in this Rule. In the result this rule is liable to be discharged.<br/><br/>         In view of the deliberation recorded above and the directions given, the rule is discharged without any order as to costs.<br/>                                   <br/><strong>        Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Karim and Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarok took active part of the conspiracy and in order to execute the decision taken in the conspiracy they actively took part in the killing of 4 (four) police personnel and Izaradar Nojer Ali. In fact, we do not find any corroborative evidence against accused, namely, (i) Dilip, (ii) Tomal, (iii) Ahmed Shah Nuru, (iv) Khairul, (v) Abdul Mannan, (vi) Rabiul Islam, (vii) Majed Ali, except mentioning their names by co-accused in their confessional statement.</strong> <strong>There are long lines of decision which have firmly settled that confession of a co-accused is not evidence, it can only lend assurance to other evidence. From the various pronouncements of the apex courts, we find that the apex Courts consistently held that confession of a co-accused is not substantive evidence and such confession cannot be the sole basis of conviction of a co-accused in the absence of independent corroborative evidence. There are long line of decisions which have firmly settled that abscondance by itself is not the conclusive proof of guilt of the accused. Considering the decisions cited in the body of judgment, the evidence on record and the circumstances, we are of the opinion that justice will be met if the impugned order of conviction and sentence of death of accused, namely, Md. Nurul Islam @ Shine @ Tapash @ Tonmoy, son of Habibur Rahman @ Habib master; and Md. Tohurul Islam @ Azizul Haque, son of Monirul Islam is maintained and the order of conviction and sentence so far as it relates to condemned prisoners, namely, (1) Md.

I. Md. Tofazzal Hossain Khan of Manda Police Station as informant lodged an F.I.R. with Manda Police Station, alleging, <em>inter-alia</em>, that on 25.08.2006 at 18-35 hours, the Officer-in-Charge of Manda Police Station informed him that the miscreants attacked Chowbariahat and they were looting away valuable things and also killing people indiscriminately. The Officer-in-Charge gave order to the informant to go to Chowbariahat with sufficient police force and arrest the miscreants. On getting the order from the O.C. of Manda Police Station, the informant entered a G. D. Entry No. 1139 dated 25.08.2006 and went to the place of occurrence with Md. Anisur Rahman, S.I. (P. W. 33), Md. Anowar Hossain, P.S.I (P.W. 32) and other forces. The distance between the Police Station and the Chowbariahat is 18 Kilometer. They reached Chowbariahat and found the dead bodies of A.S.I. A.T. Firoz, Constables, namely, Askan Ali, Farid, Babul Miah and they also found that their throats were cut. On query from the surroungding people, the informant came to know that on 25.08.2006 at 18.30 hours, 20/25 unknown miscreants wearing lungi, half shirt, full shirt, fastening gamcha on their head being armed with rifle, pipe gun, iron rod attacked the police personnel and slaughtered them by cutting their throat. The miscreants created panic in the area by exploding 8/10 bombs. The miscreants also looted away one 7.62 china pistol, handle No. 72, body No. 50007737 and 8 round of ammunitions from A.S.I. A.T.

The miscreants also stabbed Nojer Ali with sharpen knife and Nojer Ali was seriously injured. Injured Nojer Ali was taken to Rajshahi Medical College Hospital for treatment but on the way at Mohonpur he succumbed to his injuries. The miscreants also looted away about Tk. 1,00,000/-(one lac) and fled away towards west. The miscreants did massacre for about 10 minutes and they were aged in between 25-40 years. The informant informed the matter to the Officer-in-Charge over mobile phone and the Officer-in-Charge also came to the place of occurrence.<br/><br/>On the basis of the aforesaid First Information Report (shortly, F.I.R.) police recorded Manda Police Station Case No. 23 dated 28.05.2006 under sections 353/396 of the Penal Code. Police investigated the case and during investigation visited the place of occurrence, prepared sketch map with separate index thereof, examined the witnesses and recorded their statements under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, arrested the accused and arranged recording of the statements of 5 accused under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and finally submitted charge sheet No. 71 dated 16.04.2007 under sections 120B/400/402 /353 / 396 of the Penal Code against the condenmened prisoners and the accused appellants as a <em>prima-facie </em>case was made out against them.<br/><br/>The case record was transmitted to the Durto Bichar Tribunal, Rajshaji for trial. The case was numbered as Durto Bichar Tribunal Case No. 21 of 2007.<br/><br/>The learned Judge of Druto Bichar Tribunal, Rajshahi framed charge against the accused (1) Md. Tohurul Islam @ Azizul Haque, (2) Md. Nurul Islam @ Shine @ Taposh @ Tonmoy, (3) Md.

The charge was read over and explained to the accused present to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. However, charge was framed against the absconding accused in their absence.<br/><br/>In order to substantiate the charge against the accused, the prosecution has examined as many as 39 witnesses in this case.<br/><br/>After close of evidence of the prosecution witnesses, the accused on dock were examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This time also they repeated their innocence and adduced one witness as D.W. 1.  <br/><br/>The defence case, as it transpires from the trend of cross examination of the prosecution witnesses and also from the only defence witness is that the accused are innocent and they have been falsely implicated in this case. Their further case is that they have been serving in the office of CARB and they are not in any way involved in this case.<br/><br/>Considering the facts, circumstances and the evidence on record the learned Judge of the Druto Bichar Tribunal, Rajshahi convicted and sentenced the condemned prisoners and the accused appellants as aforesaid.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by, and dissatisfied with, the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 24.01.2008 passed by the learned Judge of Druto Bichar Tribunal, Rajshahi, condemned prisoners, namely,</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Shafiqul Islam son of late Mobarak filed Criminal Appeal No. 983 of 2008 and Jail Appeal 148 of 2008;</li><li style="text-align:justify">Shafiqul Islam son of Habibur Rahman preferred Criminal Appeal No. 1020 of 2008 and Jail Appeal No. 147 of 2008. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, accused appellants, namely,</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Md.

In that meeting Nurul Islam @ Shine, Ataur, Shafiqul, Abdul Karim, Sagor (since dead), Majed Ali, Pintu, Khokon, Ahmed Shah Nurul, Shafiqul Islam, son of Habibur Rahman, Tohurul, Siddique, Hossain, Rabiul and others total 20 persons were present there. In that meeting it was decided that they would kill Izaradar Lutfor, Quader and Afzal. It was further decided that if police resists, they would also kill police personnel and snatch away their arms. Haji Azimuddin made a contract with accused, namely, Dilip and Tohurul. According to the contract Haji Azimuddin would give them handsome cash and also would give them looted arms. Haji Azimuddin had a quarrel with other Izaradar 2(two) months prior to the occurrence. On 25.08.2006 at 3.45 hours, 20 accused were divided into 5 groups. He and Abdul Karim were carrying pistol. Sagor (since dead) was carrying bomb. Other groups were carrying chora, iron rod etc. They arrived at Chowbariahat at 4.30 p.m. He gave signal at 6.00 P.M. and on getting the signal the other accused exploded bombs and inflicted iron rod blows on the head of police personnel and slaughtered them. Accused Tahrul slaughtered the daroga. Accused Dilip, Ataur and Tomal killed 3(three) police personnel. At that time one person came out from toll house and the accused dealt chora blow in his neck and subsequently he died. Thereafter they left the place chanting slogan “Purbabangla Communist Party Zindabad.”<br/><br/>This is the confessional statement given by accused Nurul Islam @ Shine. If we carefully analyse the above confessional statement of Nurul Islam @ Shine we find that according to the decision taken in the meeting held on 21.08.2006, they all came to the place of occurrence and as soon as he gave signal, other accused blasted bomb, inflicted iron rod blows on the head of the police personnel and slaughtered them. From the confessional statement of this accused, we find vivid description of the occurrence. P. W. 26 is the Magistrate who recorded the statement of this accused. He (P.W. 26) stated that he alerted the accused by saying that he was not bound to confess and if he would confess it might be used against him as evidence. The learned Magistrate also stated that he gave three hours reflection time to the accused. He complied with all the provisions of law provided under section 164 and 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before recording the confessional statement of accused Nurul Islam @ Shine.  The accused also did not complain of police torture at the time of recording his statement.<br/><br/>This condemned prisoner was not examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as he absconded during trial. He absconded since 02.12.2007. So there was no occasion to examine him under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In his confessional statement, accused Nurul Islam @ Shine stated that they slaughtered the police personnel. P. W. 31 held the autopsy. He corroborated with the statement of the accused as he found that all the dead bodies of police personnel had throat cut. The evidence of P.W. 31 fully corroborates the prosecution case. The Tribunal rightly held that the time, place and manner of the occurrence have been corroborated by the evidence of all the witnesses. His confession fully corroborates with the prosecution case. Therefore, we hold the view that the Tribunal rightly held that the confession of accused Nurul Islam @ Shine was voluntury and true. Accused Nurul Islam @ Shine filed an application for retraction of the confession. The trial court did not pass any order on the application for retraction. In fact, once a confession is taken to be voluntary and true, the application of retraction has no value. We shall discuss the value of retraction of confession later in the body of the judgment.<br/><br/>Confession of accused Tohurul Islam, aged 24:-<br/>Now, let us, scrutinize and analyze the confessional statement of accsued Tohurul Islam.<br/>Police arrested accused Tohurul Islam on 01.09.2006 at 11.00 P. M. and forwarded him to the Court on 03.09.2006.<br/>Police took him on remand for 10 (ten) days.<br/>On 07.09.2006, he made confessional statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/>He filed an application for retraction of his confession but his application for retraction was rejected. <br/>He was enlarged on bail on 26.07.2007 and thereafter he absconded and did not face trial.<br/>His bail was cancelled on 02.01.2008.<br/>As he absconded during trial, he could not be examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The confessionnal statement given by accused Tohurual Islam is reproduced here which runs as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“ তহুরতল ইসলাম @ অাজিজুল হক<br/>অামি CARB অফিসে চৌবাড়িয়া ২৩ নং ব্র্যাঞ্চে ফার্ম ম্যানেজার হিসাবে ৬/৭ মাস কাল কাজ করছি। অামি বর্তমানে বিনোদপুর ডিগ্রী কলেজে পাশ কোর্সে ডিগ্রীতে পড়ছি। গত ২১.০৮.০৬ খ্রিঃ সোমবার CARB অফিস চৌবাড়িয়া ব্রাঞ্চের মিটিং করি। মিটিং-এ ১) অামি ২) নয়রতল ইসলাম @ শাহীন, ৩) দিলীপ, পিতা অজ্ঞাত সাং মাচনা, নওগা, ৪) কাশেম পিতা অজ্ঞাত সাং বলদারহার নিয়ামতপুর, ৫) খোকন পিতা ময়েজ সাং শিবপুর নিয়ামতপুর, ৬) হাসান পিতা অজ্ঞাত সাং ভোলা হাট, চাপাইনবাবগঞ্জ, ৭) তমাল, পিতা অজ্ঞাত সাং সমাজপাড়র, অাত্রাই, ৪) অাতাউর পিতা অজ্ঞাত সাং সমাজপাড়া, অাত্রাই, ৯) পিন্টু পিতা অজ্ঞাত সাং বলদাহার, নিয়ামতপুর, ১০) সাগর পিতা অজ্ঞাত সাং দেলয়াবাড়ী, মান্দা, ১১)সঞ্জয় পিতা অজ্ঞাত সাং গোদাগাড়ী, ১২) খায়রতল পিতা অজ্ঞাত, নাচোল চাপাইনবাবগঞ্জ, ১৩) করিম পিতা অজ্ঞাত তানোর, রাজশাহী, ১৪) সিদ্দিক পিতা অজ্ঞাত জেলা সাতক্ষীরা সহ অারো কয়েকজন ছিল। সন্ধ্যা অনুমান ৬.০০ টার দিকে মিটিং হয়। মিটিং শাহীন ও দিলীপ নেতৃত্ব দেয়। মিটিং সিদ্ধামত হয় চৌবাড়িয়া গরতর হাটে অপারেশন চালিয়ে হাটের ইজারাদার অাফজাল, ফজের কে মেরে ফেলতে হবে। হাজী অাজিমুদ্দিন তাদেরকে মেরে ফেললে অামাদের পার্টিকে ১২/১৩ লক্ষ টাকা দিবে শাহীন ও দিলীপ জানায়। হাজী অাজিমুদ্দন এর সাথে ঘটনার মাস দেড়েক অঅগে হাট ইজারাদারদের গন্ডগোল হয়।<br/>ঘটনার দিন ২৫/০৮/০৬ শুত্রুবার এর বিকাল অনুমান ৫টার দিকে অামরা ২০ জনের একটি দল বিভিন্ন ভাবে ভাগ হয়ে চৌবাড়িয়া গরতর হাটে যাই। অামি বাজারের পার্শ্বে পর পর ৫টি বোমা ফাটাই। তার ভয়ে লোকজন দৌড়াতে থাকে তখন অামরা পুলিশদের লোহার রড দিয়ে অাঘাত করি। ৪ জনকে অাঘাত করি। অামি দারোগাকে ছুরি দিয়ে জবাই করি। পুলিশের অসএ অামরা কেড়ে নেই। অন্য তিন জনকেও জবাই করে হত্যা করা হয়। কে জবাই করে বলতে পারব না। ইজারাদার নজের কে টোল ঘর থেকে বেরিয়ে যাওয়ার সময় তাকেও জবাই করে হত্যা করা হয়। কে জবাই করে বলতে পারব না। দারোগা ফিরোজকে সিদ্দিক, খোকন, তমাল ধরে রাখে। প্রথমে তমাল ছুরি দিয়ে অাঘাত করে। তারপর অামি তার কাছ থেকে ছুরি নিয়ে জবাই করি। তারপর অামরা পূর্ব বাংলা কমিউনিস্ট পার্টি লাল পতাকা জিন্দাবাদ বলে শ্লোগান দিতে দিতে খড়ি বাড়ী ও সাদা পুরের মধ্যসহলে চলে যাই। সেখানে দিলীপ ও শাহীনকে ছুরি, রড, পিসতল ২টি, বন্দুক ৩টি জমা দিয়ে নিয়ে বাড়ী চলে যাই। অসএগুলো দিলীপ, শাহীন, করিমের কাছে অাছে। অামি এক বৎসর অাগে সর্বহারা দলের সদস্য হই। মারার জন্য এখনো কোন টাকা পয়সা পাইনাই। শাহীন ও দিলীপ জানে টাকা পয়সা দিয়েছে কিনা অামাকে গত শুত্রুবার দিবাগত রাত অনুমান ১১টার সময় চাকলা নিয়ামতপুর থেকে পুলিশ ধৃত করেন।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From the above confessional statement, it is clear that on 21.08.2006, a meeting was held at the CARB office. In that meeting the accused and other persons were present. It was decided in the meeting that they would kill Izaradar and if they could kill Izaradars, namely, Afzal and Fazlu, accused Azimuddin would give them Tk. 12/13 lac. Haji Azimuddin had a quarrel with other Izarader, one and half months prior to the occurrence. In pursuance of the decision and agreement taken in the meeting held on 21.08.2006, the accused along with others went to the cattle market in 5 groups. He himself blasted the bombs and people started running hither and thither. The accused dealt iron rod blow on the head of 4 police personnel. He himself slaughtered the Daroga. They also snatched away the arms from police personnel. The other 3 police personnel were also slaughtered. He took the knife from accused Tomal and slaughtered Daroga Firoj. Thereafter, they left the place chanting slogan “Purba Bangla, Lal Potaka, Zindabad.”<br/><br/>Upon a careful scrutiny of the confessional statement of accused Tohurul, we find that this confessional statement is inculpatory in nature. The accused himself stated that he himself blasted the bomb and he himself slaughtered the Daroga taking knife from Tomal. It is true that on 04.10.2006 accused Tohurul filed an application for retraction. But his application for retraction was rejected. Accused Tohurul absconded after he was granted bail. As a result, he could not be examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The learned Magistrate who recorded the confession of accused Tohurul stated in no uncertain terms that he cautioned accused Tohurul that he was not bound to confess and if he would confess, it might be used against him as evidence. He also gave the accused 3 hours time for reflection. The learned Magistrate stated that when he recoreded the confessional statement of accused Tohurul, he (accused Tohurul) looked normal and his health condition was good. The accused also did not complain of police torture before the Magistrate. The learned Magistrate complied with all the provisions of section 164 and 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before recording the confession of accused Tohurul. Therefore, we find that the confession given by accused Tohurul was voluntary. Moreover, the confession given by accused Tohurul is consistent with the prosecution case. He has stated in his confession that a meeting was held on 21.08.2006 in the CARB office. In that meeting it was decided that they would kill Izaradar and they would also kill the police personnel and take away their arms. In his confession accused Tohurul gave vivid description about the occurrence. As the confession of accused Tohurul is consistent with the prosecution case, we also hold the view that the confession of accused Tohurul is true as well.<br/><br/>Another accused, namely, Shafiqul, son of Mobarak made a confession. In his confession he stated as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>অামি CARB অফিস চৌবাড়িয়া ব্রাঞ্চে গত ২১.০৫.০৬ খ্রিঃ তারিখ থেকে চাকুরী করছি। CARB অফিসের মান্দা ও তানোর থানা এলাকার এরিয়া ম্যানেজার মোঃ রবিইল ইসলাম পিতা অজ্ঞাত সাং কাকন হাট থানা- তানোর, রাজশাহী অামাকে পূর্ব বাংলা কমিউনিস্ট পার্টি এম, এল, লাল পতাকা দল করার জন্য বলে অনুমান ২ মাস অাগে বলে। অামি তার কথা মতো। ঐ দলে যোগ দেই। গত ২১.০৮.০৬ খ্রিঃ তারিখ অনুমান সন্ধ্যা ৬.০০ টার দিকে CARB অফিসে চৌবাড়িয়া ব্রাঞ্চে একটি মিটিং হয়। ঐ মিটিং এ ১) হাজী অাজিম উদ্দীন পিতা অজ্ঞাত সাং খড়িবাড়ী নিয়ামতপুর, ২) অামি, ৩) নূরতল ইসলাম ওরফে তাপস ওরফে শাহীন পিতা হাবিবুল মাস্টার সাং নিমদিঘী নিয়ামতপুর, ৪) সানাউল পিতা অজ্ঞাত দেলুয়াবাড়ী CARB ব্রাঞ্চের ফার্ম ম্যানেজার, ৫) রঘুনাথ পিতা অজ্ঞাত দেলুয়াবাড়ী CARB অফিসের বাবুর্চি, ৬) সাগর কৃষক প্রতিনিধি সাং বলিগ্রাম, মান্দা ৭) খায়রতল পিতা অজ্ঞাত ফার্ম ম্যানেজার CARB ব্রাঞ্চ চৌবাড়িয়া, ৮) তহুরতল ইসলাম পিতা অজ্ঞাত ফার্ম ম্যানেজার চৌবাড়িয়া CARB ব্রাঞ্চ, ৯) অাঃ করিম কামারপুর ব্রাঞ্চের ফার্ম ম্যানেজার, ১০) সঞ্জয় পিতা ধীরেন সাহা সাং গোদাগাড়ী, রাজশাহী, ১১) খোকন সিনজেনটা গ্রতপের মাঠ কর্মী, ১২) ছিদ্দিক সিনজেনটা গ্রতপের মাঠ কর্মী, ১৩) মোঃ শফিকুল ইসলাম, ১৪) মোঃ পিন্টু উভয় পিতা মৃত হাবিবুর রহমান, ১৫) অাঃ মান্নান CARB অাগের ব্রাঞ্চের ফার্ম ম্যানেজার, ১৬) অাঃ অাউয়াল অাগোর ব্রাঞ্চের ফার্ম ম্যানেজার উপসিহত ছিল। মির্টি এ সিদ্ধামত হয় ২৫.০৮.০৬ তাং বেলা ১২.০০ টার শুত্রুবারে চৌবাড়ীয়া গরতর হাটে অসএ লুট (পুলিশের) অার ইজারাদারদের খুন করা হবে, হাজী অাজিমুদ্দিন, নুরতল ইসলাম @ তাপস সহ অারো অনেকে বত্তুব্য রাখে। ২৫.০৮.০৬ তাং বেলা ১২.০০ টায় রাহেলা বেগমের বাড়ীতে তহুরতল ঐ বাড়ীতে ভাড়া থাকত। অামরা হাজী অাজিমুদ্দিন ব্যতিত উপরে বর্ণিত ১৫ জন এবং বহিরাগত ৫ জন মোট ২০ জন উপসিহত হই। দুপুরের খাবার দাবার রাহেলা বেগম পাক করে দেয়। খাবার শেষে অামরা ভিসিপি দেখি। বিকাল ৫.৩০ মিঃ অামরা  ২০ জন ৫ গ্রতপে এক এক গ্রতপে ৪ জন করে বিভত্তু হয়ে হাটের অপারেশনে বের হই। ১ম গ্রতপে ১) নুরতল ইসলাম @ শাহীন ২) সানাউল, ৩) রধুনাথ, ৪) সাগর ২য় গ্রতপে ১) তহুরতল, রবিউল, করিম, জয়নাল ৩য় গ্রতপে খায়রতল ২) সঞ্জয় ৩) অামি, শফিকুল, ৪) খোকন ৪র্থ গ্রতপে ১) মান্নান, ২) অাওয়াল, ৩) মোঃ শফিকুল ইসলাম, ৪) পিন্টু ৫ম গ্রতপে ১) সিদ্দিক, ২) দিলীপ এবং অপরিচিত ২ জন ছিল। নুরতল ইসলাম এবং রবিউলের কাছে ১টি করে পিসতল ছিল। সঞ্জয়, তহুরতল, সিদ্দিক, মান্নান সহ অপরিচিত ২ জনের হাতে ১টি করে বোমা ৬টি ছোরা ছিল। সানাউল ও সাগরের হাতে বোমা ছিল। করিম, অানার, খায়রতল, জয়নাল, শফিকুল, অাউয়ালের এবং পিন্টুর হাতে ও বোমা ছিল। বাকীদের হাতে লোহার রড ছিল। অসএ লুট করার দায়িত্ব ছিল। ১) তহুরতল, ২) নুরতল ইসলাম, ৩) দিলীপ, ৪) করিম এবং অজ্ঞাতনামা ২জন। ঘটনাসহলে গেছে খায়রতল এবং অাউয়াল বোমা ফাটায় লোকজন ভয়ে পালিয়ে যায়। কয়েকজন লোহার রড দিয়ে পুলিশের ৩ জন কনস্ট্যাবল এবং এ, এস, অাই ফিরোজকে এবং একজন কনস্ট্যাবলকে অাঃ মান্নান ছোরা দিয়ে জবাই করে। বাকী দুজনকে কে জবাই করে দেখি নাই। হাটের ইজারাদারকে হত্যা করা হয়। কে করে জানি না। পুলিশের ১টি পিসতল ও ৩টি বন্দুক অামরা লুট করে পূর্ব বাংলা কমিউনিস্ট পার্টি এম, এল লাল পতাকা জিন্দাবাদ শ্লোগান দিতে দিতে মান্নান মোড়ের দিকে চলে যাই। মাসতানের মোড় থেকে ২টি সাদা রংয়ের মাইত্রেুাবাসযোগে অামরা নিয়ামত থানার রামনগর মোড়ে যাই। অামি, সানাউল ও সিদ্দিক রামনগর নেমে যাই। অসএ ও বোমা গাড়ীতে থেকে যায়। বাকীতে মাইত্রেুা নিয়ে পশ্চিম দিকে চলে যায়। পরে সিদ্দিক চৌবাড়িয়ার চলে অাসে। অামিও সানাউল রামনগর থেকে ছুটাছুটি করে বাড়ী চলে যাই। ২৮.০৯.০৬ তারিখ দিবাগত রাত ৫.০০ টার সময় অামাকে নোনাহার অামার শ্বশুর বাড়ী থেকে পুলিশ গ্রেপ্তার করে। অসএগুলো এখন কার কাছে জানি না। এই অামার জবানবন্দী।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From the above confessional statement, it is clear that this condemned prisoner was present at the conspiracy held on 21.08.2006 in the CARB office at Chowbaria, that is, he actively took part in the conspiracy for taking away the arms from police personnel and also for killing the police personnel and the Izaradar. He was in group No. 3 with other accused, namely, Khairul, Sonjoy and Khokan. He stated that Khairul (a man of his group) and Awal blasted bomb. He also stated that they looted away one pistol and 03 guns from police personnel and thereafter went away, chanting slogan, “Purba Bangla Communist Party Lal Potaka Zindabad.” From the above confessional statement, it is clear that this accused Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarak took active part at the conspiracy held on 21.08.2006 in the CARB Office, Chowbaria and he was also in one of 5 groups who are responsible for killing the police personnel and Nojer Ali. According to agreement and conspiracy dated 21.08.2006 they killed police personnel and Nojer Ali and stnatched away the arms from police personnel.<br/><br/>Police arrested accused Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarak on 29.09.2006 at 05.00 P. M. and he was forwarded to the Court on 30.09.2006. Police took him on remand for 04 days. He did not file any application for retraction. However, he was examined under 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. At the time of recording of his confession, the learned Magistrate compiled with all the provisions of sections 164 and 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He cautioned him that he was not bound to confess and if he would confess it would be used against him as evidence. He also gave him 03 hours time for reflection. He did not complain of police torture before the learned Magistrate when his confessional statement was recorded. P. W. 26 (the learned Magistrate) was thoroughly cross-examined by the learned Lawyer appearing on behalf of the accused. From the evidence of P. W. 26 nothing came out to believe that police tortured him during his custody under police. He was examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on 06.01.2008, i. e, he was examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 01 (one) year 04 (four) months after his arrest and this time he complained of police torture before the Tribunal. He could not produce any documentary and circumstantial evidence in support of his complain of police torture. We have already stated that once a confessional statement is taken to be voluntary and true, belated retraction has no value (45DLR(1993)306.)<br/><br/>The learned Magistrate stated that he complied with all the provisions of sections 164 and 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before recording the confession. The learned Magistrate also did not find any sign of torture on the person of accused Shafiqul son of Mobarok. The accused did not also show any sign of police torture on his person. The Magistrate gave certificate that the confession was voluntary. This confession is also consistent with the prosecution case. Since the confessional statement of this accused is consistent with the prosecution case, we are also of the opinion that the confession of accused Shafiqul Islam, son of Mobarak was voluntary and true as well.<br/><br/>Now, let us turn to the confessional statement of accused-appellant Roghunath Barmon.<br/>The confession of accused-appellant Roghunath Barmon:<br/>Police arrested Roghunath Barmon on 02.09.2006 in connection with other case.<br/>He was shown arrested on 05.10.2006 in this case.<br/>On 05.10.2006, he was given 04 days police remand and on 09.11.2006 he was given another 05 days police remand.<br/>He made confessional statement on 12.11.2006.<br/>The confessional statement of Roghunath Borman is as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>""অামি দেলুয়াবাড়ী CARB অফিসে ভাত রান্না করার কাজ করতাম ২/৩ মাস যাবত। ২৫.০৮.০৬ শুত্রুবার সন্ধ্যা ৬.০০ টার সময় চৌবাড়িয়া গরতর হাটে ঘটনা। অামি সকালে ভাত রান্না করি। খাওয়া দাওয়া করে শাহীন ও সাগর গোদা গাড়ী যায়। মিটিং অংশগ্রহণের জন্য। নুরতল ইসলাম @ শাহীনের পিতা-অজ্ঞাত, সাং নিম দীঘি, থানা-নিয়ামতপুর এবং সাগরের পিতার নাম জানি না, সাং কালিগ্রাম, মান্দা, নওগা। তারা খাওয়ার সময় অামাকে বিকাল ৩টা ৩.৩০ টার সময় চৌবাড়িয়া হাটে যেতে বলে। অামি বিকাল ৩.৩০ টা দিকে চৌবাড়িয়া CARB অফিসের কাছে নুরতল ইসলাম @ শাহীনকে দাড়িয়ে থাকতে দেখি। শাহীন অামাকে CARB অফিসের পাশে পিন্টু পিতা অজ্ঞাত সাং চৌবাড়িয়া মান্দা এর বাড়ীতে নিয়ে যায়। যেয়ে দেখি ১৬/১৭ জন লোক টিভি দেখছে। তাদের মধ্যে শাহীন, সাগর, তহুরতল পিতা অজ্ঞাত সাং নিমদীঘি নিয়ামতপুর, সানাউল্লাহ, সঞ্জয়, পিন্টু, পিন্টুর ভাই শফিকুল অপর শফিকুল পিতা ও ঠিকানা অজ্ঞাতদেরকে চিনতে পারি। বাকীদের চিনতে পারি নাই। ওখানে কিছুক্ষণ থাকার পর শাহীন ও সঞ্জয় বোমার ব্যাগ ও পিসতল (৩টি) বের করে। শাহীনের হাতে বোমা ও ১ টি পিসতল, সাগরের হাতে ১টি বোমা ও ১টি পিসতল, সঞ্জয়ের হাতে ১টি পিসতল, শফিকুল (CARB অফিসের) এর হাতে বোমার ব্যাগ ছিল, তহুরতলের কাছে ১টি ছোরা ও ১টি বোমা ছিল। শফিকুল অামাকে বোমা দেয়। অামরা সবাই ৪ জন করে ৫টি গ্রতপের ভিবত্তু হয়ে সন্ধ্যা ৬.০০ টার দিকে হাটে যাই। অামি এবং সানাউল্লাহ হাটের পূর্ব দিকে দাড়িয়ে ছিলাম। শাহীন ও তহুরতল ইসলাম ইশার দিলে শফিকুল বোমা ফাটায়। লোকজন পালাতে লাগল। অামি ও সানাউল্লাহ ঘটনাসহলের কাছে দেখি ৪ জন পুলিশ জবাই করা অবসহায় অাছে। অামি কাউকে জবাই করতে দেখি নাই। শুনেছি তহুরতল ২ জনকে শাহীন ১ জনকে জবাই করেছে। হাটের ইজারাদার হাসপাতালে মারা যায়। তাকে কে মেরেছে জানি না। ঘটনার পর দিয়ে দেখি শাহীন সহ বাকীরা পাকা রাসতার উপর দাড়িয়ে অাছে। অামি অামার কাছে থাকা বোমাটি শফিকুলের হাতে দেই। সানাউল্লাহ সহ অামাকে রেখে বাকীরা দক্ষিণ পশ্চিম কর্নারের দিকে চলে যায়। অামি বাস করে দেলুয়াবাড়ী বাস স্ট্যান্ডে নেমে যাই । অফিসে গিয়ে রাত্রে থাকি। শাহীন ও সাগর পরের দিন সকাল ৯/১০ টার দিকে মটর সাইকেল যোগে অাসে। শাহীন অামাকে বলে সঞ্জয় পুলিশের ২টি অসএ নিয়ে গেছে। ২টি পিসতল ও ১টি পুলিশের অসএ তানোর করিমের বাড়ীতে রেখে এসেছে। পরের দিন সাগরের অসএ গুলো নিয়ে অাসার কথা ছিল। নিয়ে এসেছে কিনা জানি না। ঘটনার ৬/৭ দিন পর পুলিশ অামাকে কালী গ্রাম CARB অফিস থেকে ধরে। এই অামার জবানবন্দী।''</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>If we scan the confessional statement of Roghunath, we find that accused Roghunath was in killing mission and he was included in one of the 05 groups. The learned Magistrate stated that before recording the confession of Roghunath, he complied with all the provisions of sections 164 and 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He also stated that he duly cautioned accused Roghunath that he was not bound to confess and if he would confess it might be used against him as evidence. He also gave 03 hours reflection time to the accused before recording his confession. He did not complain of police torture before the learned Magistrate. He did not even say anything about police torture in his statement under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Therefore we find that the confessional statement of Roghunath was voluntary.<br/><br/>Accused Roghunath has given the vivid description of the occurrence. He corroborated with other confessing accused and stated that there were 05 groups in the killing mission and he belonged to one of the groups. We find that the confessional statement of Roghunath is consistent with the prosecution case and as such we hold the view that the confession is also true.<br/><br/>Now, let us turn to the confessional statement of accused Abdul Karim.<br/>The Tribunal has sentenced him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life.<br/>Police arrested him on 05.09.2006 at 02.00 A. M.<br/>On 07.09.2006, he was taken on police remand for 06 days and he made confessional statement on 10.09.2006.<br/>He was examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/>He was also granted bail but he could not avail of the privilege of bail because he was in the jail in another case.

Shine and Sagor (since dead) left for Deluabari. This statement of Abdul Karim is consistent with the statement of co-accused Nurul Islam @ Shine who made inculpatory statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The confession of Nurul Islam is inculpatory in nature and he categorically stated that Abdul Karim was with them in the meeting and in killing mission. This accused Abdul Karim also stated that Nurul Islam @ Shine made him a phone call by his mobile phone being No. 01713004403 and requested him to take him (accused Abdul Karim) to Deluabari as there was fight in Chowbariahat. Accused Tohurul Islam also stated that Abdul Karim was present at the meeting held on 21.08.2006 and he was also present in the killing mission. The confession of Tohurul Islam is inculpatory in nature. Accused Shafiqul Islam also stated that accused Abdul Karim was present at the meeting held on 21.08.2006 and he was in the killing mission in group No. 2. Abdul Karim admitted that accused Nurul Islam @ Shine and Sagor came to his house by motor cycle and stayed there at night. P. W. 33 seized the motor cycle from Abdul Karim, P. W. 20 is the seizure list witness of motor cycle. All these circumstances go to show that accused Abdul Karim was present at the conspiracy held on 21.08.2006 and he was also present in the killing mission on the date of occurrence and took part in the killing of 4(four) police personnel and Nojer Ali.<br/><br/>Police arrested accused Abu Bakkar Siddique on 14.09.2006. He was taken on police remand for 05 days and bail was granted to him on 14.05.2007. Thereafter, his bail was cancelled on 02.01.2007 and since then he has been absconding. Co-accused Nurul Islam, Tohurul Islam and Shafiqul Islam in their statements under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure mentioned the name of Abu Bakkar Siddique and stated that he was present both at the meeting held on 21.08.2006 and in the killing mission. Though police took him on remand for 05 days, this condemned prisoner did not make any confession. Though accused Abu Bakkar Siddique did not make confession, the other confessing accused mentioned his name. Accused Tohurul made inculpatory statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and he specifically mentioned the name of accused Abu Bakkar Siddique. Since the confession of accused Tohurul is inculpatory in nature and since we have found his confession voluntary and true we have reason to believe that accused Abu Bakkar Siddique was present both at the compiracy held on 21.08.2006 and also in the killing mission. From the voluntary and true confession of accused Tohurul and also from other confessing accused, we find that accused Abu Bakkar Siddique was present both at the compiracy any and in the killing mission. He was also one of the members of 5<sup>th</sup> group with accused Dilip and 2 others. Therefore, we find from the inculpatory confession of accused Tohurul and from other evidence that the accused Abu Bakkar Siddique was present at the time of commssion of offence of killing of 4 police personnel and Izaradar Nojer Ali. There are long lines of decisions which have firmly settled that confession of co-accused can be used against other accused, if the confession is inculpatory in nature and other corraborative evidence is available. Our this view is getting support from the decision in the following cases.<br/><br/>In case of The State Vs. Mir Hossain @ Mira and other reported in 56 DLR (HCD) 124, it has been held in paragraph 34:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“34. Under Section 30 of the Evidence Act, confession of a co-accused can be taken into consideration and on the strength of that confession, another co-accused can be convicted provided the said confession is corroborated by any other evidence, either direct and circumstantial.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of The State Vs. Abul Khair and others reported in 44 DLR (HCD) 284, it has been held, inter alia, in paragraph 9 that it is clear from the terms of sections 30 of the Evidence Act that where more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, a confession  made by any one of them affecting himself and any one of the co-accused can be taken into consideration by the Court not only against the maker of the confession, but also against the co-accused. Strictly speaking, it may not be a piece of evidence within the meaning of the term, but it lends assurance to the other evidence on record<br/>In the case of Moqbul Hossain vs State 12 DLR (SC) 217, the statement of a confessional nature were made by the co-accused affecting themselves and the appellant, the question arose as to whether section 30 of the Evidence Act could not be called in aid of the prosecution in support of the appellant’s conviction, SA  Rahman J, held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“....... Section 30 of the Evidence Act merely provides that the Court “may take into consideration” such confessions as against the appellant, as well as against their makers. The language of the section is very guarded and lends no warrant to the inference that such a statment made by a co-acccused could be treated as substantive evidence against the other person, sufficient to sustain his conviction. It is well settled that there ought to be other evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, linking such a person with the crime, before a confession made by the co-accused could be adverted to, in adjudging the guilt of that person.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of State vs Nalini (1999) 5 SCC, 253 it has been held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“A plain reading of section 30 of the Evidence Act discloses that when the following conditions exist, namely, (1) more persons than one are being tried jointly; (ii) the joint trial of the persons is for the same offence; (iii) a confession is made by one of such persons (who are being tried jointly for the same offence); (iv) such a confession affects the maker as well as such persons (who are being tried jointly for the same offence); (v) such a confession if proved in court, the court may take into consideration such confession against the maker thereof as well as against such persons (who are being jointly tried for the same offence).”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the instant case we find that accused Nurul Islam @ Shine, accused Tohurul Islam have made inculpatory confession and in their confessions they have given vivid descriptions of the occurrence and they have confessed that they were present at the conspiracy and they themselves killed the police personnel and Izaradar Nojer Ali. We have already held that their confessions are voluntary and true.<br/>About accused Abdul Karim, we find that accused Nurul Islam @ Shine, Tohurul Islam and Shafiqul Islam have mentioned in their confessional statements the name of accused A. Karim. He was present both at the conspiracy and the killing mission. The motor cycly of accused A. Karim was used by confessing accused Nurul Islam @ Shine and Sagor (since died). Police also seized the motor cycle from accused A. Karim. P. W. 20 Mamnur Rashid is the seizure list witness of the motor cycle belonged to Abdul Karim. P. W. 33 stated that he seized the alamat i. e. motor cycle from the house of A. Karim. So, from the inculpatory confessional statements of accused Nurul Islam @ Shine and Tohurul Islam and from the confessional statement of Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarak couple with the evidence of P. W. 20 and P. W. 33, we find accused A. Karim was present both at the conspiracy and the killing mission.<br/><br/>Accused Nurul Islam @ Shine, Tohurul Islam and Roghunath mentioned the name of accused Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarok. In their statements under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, they mentioned that accused Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarok was present both at the conspiracy held on 21.08.2006 and in the killing mission. Accused Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarok has given vivid description about the conspiracy held on 21.08.2006 and the occurrence took place on 25.08.2006. Accused Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarok categorically stated in his confessional statement that he was present both at the meeting held on 21.08.2006 and in the killing mission and he was one of the members of group No. 3. He also stated that they looted one pistol and 03 guns and left the place chanting slogan, “Purba Bangla Communist Party, ML Lal Potaka Zindabad.” Therefore, from the inculpatory confessional statements of Nurul Islam @ Shine, Tohurul Islam and from the confession of accused Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarok himself, we find that accused Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarok was present both at the conspiracy and in the killing mission.<br/><br/>Accused Roghunath Borman also stated that he was in the killing mission. He also gave vivid description about the conspiracy held on 21.08.2006 and the occurrence took place on 25.08.2006. He stated that accused Nurul Islam @ Shine and Tuhrul Islam gave the signal and Shafiqul blasted the bomb and he (Roghunath) and Sanaullah saw 04 (four) police personnel were slaughtered. So, from his own confessional statement and from the inculpatory confessional statement of Nurul Islam @ Shine, Tohurul Islam and from the confession of Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarak, we find that accused Roghunath was also very much present at the killing mission, that is, he participated in the killing of 4(four) police personnel and Izaradar Nojer Ali. There is also corraborative evidence against rest accused, that is, Abu Bakkar Siddique, Nurun Nabi Hossain @ Khoka, Shafiqul son of Habibur Rahman, Sonjoy and Pintu. We find that co-accused mentioned their name in their statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and we also find other circumstantial evidence agsinst them. P. W. 2 Rahela Begum stated in her cross-examination by the prosecution (she was declared hostile) that Tohurul took rent of her house and he (Tohurul) used to live there. She also stated that Shafiqul used to live in her house as tenant. She used to cook for her tenants. She also stated that all the accused took launch from her house and watched T. V. and, thereafter, all went to Chowbariahat. Daroga seized the T. V. from the house of Rahela Begum by preparing a seizure list. She rented her house to four persons who used to serve in CARB office. P. W. 2 corraborated with other P.W.s about time, place of occurrence and manner of occurrence. She admitted that 04 persons including Tohurul used to live in her house as tenants.<br/><br/>Accused Tohurul Islam made inculpatory confession and he also mentioned the name of Siddique and Khokan (accused Nurun Nabi Hossain) and 14 others who were present at the conspiracy held on 21.08.2006 at the CARB office at Chowbaria. He (accused Tohurul) also stated that on 21.08.2006 about 05.00 P. M, they (20 persons) were divided into 5 groups and went to Chowbaria cattle market to execute their agreement and he himself slaughtered Daroga. He stated that accused Siddique and Khokan caught hold of Daroga, A.S.I. A. T. Firoj and he himself slaughtered Daroga. Similarly co-accused Nurul Islam @ Shine also mentioned that Khokan (accused Nurun Nabi Hossain) and Siddique were involved in the occurrence.<br/><br/>P. W. 10, Ashraful Islam stated that the occurrence took place on 25.08.2006 at 6/6.15 hours. He has a medicine shop in Chowbariahat. He heard that the miscreants created panic and killed 04 police personnel. Police seized 14” Black and White T. V. from the house of Rahela and prepared seizure list wherein he put his signature. P. W. 11 Nazrul Haque stated that on 30.09.2006, police officer brought accused Roghunath Borman to the house of Rahela. This P. W. 11 went to the house of Rahela alongwith other and put his signature in the seizure list when police seized 14” Black and White T. V. P. W. 11 stated that accused Roghunath Borman disclosed that he and others were watching T. V. in the house of Rahela before committing the occurrence. Rahela also stated that she cooked food for 15/20 persons and after they took their food, they all went out. P. W. 11 stated that he heard that Haji Azim Uddin had a quarrel with other Izaradar of Chowbariahat. P. W. 4 stated in his cross examination by the prosecution (he was declared hostile) that there was a quarrel over the collection of toll and he fully corroborated P. W. 11. He further stated that on 2.6.2006, there was a quarrel regarding collection of toll of Chowbariahat and the brother of Haji Azim Uddin was confined and as a result Haji Azim Uddin threatened to other Izaradars. P. W. 23 Altaf Uddin stated that on 10.11.2006, police seized utensils from the house of Rahela (P.W.2) in his presence and police prepared the seizure list wherein he put his signature. He proved his signature which was marked as Exhibit 19 and he also proved the utensils which were proved as material Exhibit-XXX. P. W. 24 Baki Mondal, stated that when he was going back home, police took him to the house of Rahela Begum. He also saw there Roghunath Borman under police custody. Police seized utensils from the house of Rahela Begum (P.W.2). The Officer-in-Charge disclosed that meat was cooked in the said utensils. Rahela Begum (P.W.2) also stated that meat was cocked in the said utensil. Roghunath in his statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure also stated that on the date of occurrence dated 25.08.2006, Nurul Islam @ Shine told him to go to Chowbariahat and accordingly he went to Chowhbariahat. He went to the house of Pintu and saw that 16/17 persons were watching T. V. there. He mentioned the name of Shine, Sagor (since dead) Tohurul, Sanaullah, Sonjoy, Shafiqul brother of Pintu, Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarak and stated that they were present there. He accompanied Shine and Tohurul Islam to the house of Rahela Begum as per the decision of the meeting held on 21.08.2006. The occurrence took place in Chowbariahat on 25.08.2006. Similarly co-convict Shafiqul Islam, son of Mobarak mentioned in details about the conspiracy held on 21.08.2006. He also mentioned the name of Haji Azim Uddin, Roghunath, Sonjoy, Shafiqul Islam and Pintu who were present in the conspiracy held on 21.08.2006.<br/><br/>Accused Roghunath also corroborated other accused and stated in his confession that P. W. 2 Rahela Begum cooked meat and after launch all the accused watched T. V. Though accused Azim Uddin, Sanaul, Siddique, Khokan (accused Nurun Nabi Hossain) did not make any confession but their names have been disclosed by Nurul Islam, Tohurul, Shafiqul son of Mobarak and Roghunath and we also find corraborativ evidence against them.<br/><br/>We have considered the evidence of prosecution witnesses and we find that there was an enmity between accused Haji Azim Uddin and Izaradars of Chowbariahat and Haji Azim Uddin openly gave threat to other Izaradar and this matter of threat was disclosed at the meeting of conspiracy held on 21.08.2006. The time, place and manner of occurrence have been proved beyond doubt. It has also been proved that the house of Rahela Begum was used as shelter place before the occurrence took place.<br/><br/>Considering the evidence of prosecution witnesses we have reason to believe that accused Hazi Azimuddin, Siddique, Khokon (accused Nurun Nabi Hossain), Sanaul and Shafiqul son of Habibur Rahman along with 5 confessing accused, namely, Nurul Islam @ Shine, Tohurul, Roghunath, A. Karim and Shafiqul Islam son of Mobarok took active part at the conspiracy and in order to execute the decision taken at the conspiracy they actively took part in the killing of 4 police personnel and Izaradar Nojer Ali. In fact, we do not find any corraborative evidence against accused, namely, 1. Dilip, 2. Tomal, 3. Ahmed Shah Nuru, 4. Khairul, 5. Abdul Mannan, 6. Rabiul Islam, 7. Majed Ali, except mentioning their names by co-accused in their confessional statement.<br/><br/>There are long lines of decision which have firmly settled that confession of a co-accused is not evidence, it can only lend assurance to other evidence. Let us have a glimpse over some of the decisions of our apex Court to ascertain the evidentiary value of confessional statement of co-accused.<br/><br/>In the case of Amir Hossain Howlader and other Vs. The State, 37 DLR (AD) 139, the Appellate Division has held as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The statement of a co-accused does not fall within the definition of evidence as given in section 3 of the Evidence Act. This is for the simple reason that it is not made on oath, that it is not made in presence of other person affected and that its veracity not tested by cross-examination. It is therefore a very weak evidence against a co-accused, if it is regarded as evidence under section 30. It may be pointed out that the confessional statement of a co-accused is much weaker than the evidence of an approver which fulfils all the three ingredients of ‘evidence.’</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In on such case namely, Bhuboni Sahu Vs. The king, 76 Indian Appeals, 147, the Privy Council observed:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“ But a confession of a co-accused is obviously evidence of a very weak type, It does not indeed come within the definition of ‘evidence’ contained in section 3 of the Evidence Act, It is not required to be given on oath, nor in the presence of the accused and it cannot be tested by cross-examination. Section 30, however, provides that the court may take the confession into consideration and thereby, no doubt, makes it evidence on which the court may act; but the section does not say that the confession is to amount to proof. Clearly there must be other evidence. The confession is only one element in the consideration of the facts proved in the case; it can be put into the scale and weighed wth the other evidence.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of Joygun Bibi Vs. State, 12 DLR (SC) 156 it has been held as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>It is true that if there were no other evidence against Joygun Bibi except the confession of Abdul Majid, then, the confession by itself being merely a matter to be taken into consideration, and not having the quality of evidence against Joygun Bibi, it could rightly be held in law that her conviction could not be sustained on the confession alone.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of the State Vs. Lalu Mia and another, 39 DLR (AD) 117, the Appellate Division has held:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“It is unnecessary to go into long line of decisions which has firmly settled that such confessional statement can be taken into consideration in a limited manner. But it cannot be made the foundation of a conviction if there is no other reliable evidence tending to prove the guilt of the accused. The confession made by them can be used only in support of other evidence that is to corroborate the other evidence.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of Lutfon Nahar Begum Vs. The State, 27 DLR (AD29 it was held that confession of a co-accused could not be treated as substantive evidence against another accused but that it could only be used to lend assurance to other evidence.<br/><br/>In a recent case of Babar Ali Mollah and others Vs. The State, 44 DLR (AD)10, the Appellate Division has held as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Section 30 of the Evidence Act contemplates that a confession made by a co-accused in a joint trial for the same offence affecting himself and others may be taken into consideration. In other words, the confession of a co-oaccused may lend assurance to the other evidence on record. In the present case the evidence of P.Ws 1 and 5 being unreliable and insufficient to independently support the conviction of the appellants, the confession of the co-accused cannot lend any additional assurance tothe substantive evidence. Since, we have earlier held that the substantive evidence is unreliable and there being no other evidence the confession cannot be considered against the appellants in the present case.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From the various pronouncements of the apex courts, we find that the apex Courts consistently held that confession of a co-accused is not substantive evidence and such confession cannot be the sole basis of conviction of a co-accused in the absence of independent and corroborative evidence.<br/><br/>It is true that accused Dilip, Tomal, Khairul, Abdul Awal and Rabiul Islam (surrendered after the judgment) absconded since begining and they did not face the trial. But abscondence itself is not the conclusive prove of guilt of the accused in absence of legal evidence. Only because of abscondence these accused could not held responsible for committing the offence.<br/><br/>There are long line of decisions which have firmly settled that abscondance by itself is not the conclusive proof of guilt of the accused. Our this view is getting support from a number of decisions. In the case of the State-Vs- Lalu Miah and another, 39 DLR (AD)117, it was held that abscondance by itself is not an incriminating matter, even an innocent person if implicated in the ejahar for a serious crime some times absconds to avoid harassment during investigation by the police. In the case of The State Vs. Safikul Islam 1991 BLD(AD) 121, it has been held that abscondance of the accused since the date of occurrence itself is not conclusive proof of his guilt or guilty conscience, but it lends weight to the circumstantial evidenc against him. Similar view has been taken in the cases of Ashraf Ali Munshi Vs. STate 48 DLR 590, Shahjahan Vs. State 46 DLR 575, State Vs. Balai Chandra Sarker, 47 DLR 467, State Vs. Sree Ranjit Kumar Pramanik, 45 DLR 660, Abdul Khaleque Vs. State, 45 DLR 75, State Vs. Badsha Mollah 41 DLR 11.<br/><br/>         Therefore, in view of the above settled principle of law, we are inclined to hold that accused Dilip, Tomal, Khairul, Abdul Awal and Rabiul Islam can not be held responsible for alleged conspiracy and murder of 4 (four) police personnel and Izaradar Nojer Ali only because they absconded after the occurrence in the absence of any other legal evidence against them.<br/> <br/>The learned Judge of the Tribunal found accused,</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Md. Tohurul Islam @ Azizul Hoque</li><li style="text-align:justify">Md. Nurul Islam @ Shine @ Tonmoy</li><li style="text-align:justify">Md.

However, besides inculpatory confessions of accused Nurul Islam @ Shine and Tohurul Islam and the confessional statements of accused Md. Abdul Karim, Md. Shafiqul Islam and Roghunath, some other circumstantial evidences are available as we have discussed hereinbefore, against the following accused, namely,</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Md. Nurul Islam @ Shine</li><li style="text-align:justify">Md. Tohurul Islam @ Azizul Haque</li><li style="text-align:justify">Md.

However, we also find that evidence is available against the following accused, namely,</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Roghunath Barmon</li><li style="text-align:justify">Abdul Karim</li><li style="text-align:justify">Sanaul Islam</li><li style="text-align:justify">Haji Azimuddin </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">There is also no corroborative evidence on record against accused, nmely, 1. Ahmed Shah Nurul and 2. Khairul Islam except mentioning their names by co-accused.<br/> <br/>It is true that accused Md. Tohurul Islam @ Azizul Haque filed applciation for retraction of his confession and the learned trial court rejected his application for retraction.<br/> <br/>Accused Nurul Islam @ Shine @ Toma @ Tanmay had also filed application for retraction on 04.10.2006. But once the confession is taken to be true and voluntary, the application for retraction of confession has no value. In this regard reliance may be placed on the case of Ayesha khatun and others Vs. The State, 19 DLR (1967)818. In the case referred to above it has been held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“If a court believes a confession whether judicial or extra judicial retracted or not retracted to be voluntary and true, it can convict the accused on its sole basis. This view has been expressed by a Division Bench of the High Court of West Pakistan in the case of Nawabuddin Vs. Crown. The Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of State Vs. Minhun @ Gul observed as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Retracted confession whether judicial or extra judicial could legally be taken in to consideration against the maker of those confessions himself and if his confessions were found to be true and voluntary then there was no need at all to look for further corraboration. It is now well settled that as against the maker himself his confession, judicial and extra judicial whether retracted or not retracted can in law validly form the sole basis of his conviction, if the court is satisfied and believes that it was true and was not obtained by torture, coercion or inducement.<br/> <br/>In the case of the State Vs. Minhun @ Gul Hassan PLD 1964, Supreme Court of Pakistan at page 813, has held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Retracted confession, whether judicial or extra-judicial, could legally be taken into consideration against the maker of those confessions himself, and if the confessions were found to be true and voluntary, then there was no need at all to look for further corroboration. As against the maker himself his confesison, judicial or extra-judicial, whether retracted or not retracted, can in law validly form the sole basis of his conviction, if the Court is satisfied and believes that it was true and voluntary and was not obtained by torture or coercion or inducement. The question, however, as to whether in the facts and circumstances of a given case the Court should act upon such a confession alone is an entirely different question, which relates to the weight and evidentiary value of the confession and not to its admissibility  in law.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of the State Vs. Fazu Kazi @ Fazlur Rahman and others. 29 DLR (SC) (1977) 271, it has been held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“A conviction of the confessing accused based on a retracted confession even if uncorroborated is not illegal, if the Court believes that it is voluntary and true”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of State Vs. Nurul Hoque, 45 DLR (1993)306 the High Court Division has held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“In the instant case the confessional statement of Semona Khatun had been retracted in her 342 statement only but not before. A confession can be taken into evidence though retracted, if found by the court to be true and voluntary and a belated retraction by a confessing accused at the end of the trial under section 342 would be of no value (Ref:PLD 1964 (AC) 813; 31 DLR 312, 16 DLR 598)”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Hafizuddin Vs. The State 42 DLR 397, it has been held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The law on this point is that a confessional statement, whether retracted or not if found to be true and voluntary, can form the basis of conviction of the maker”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Bakul Chandra Sarker Vs. The State 45 DLR 260 the High Court Division has held as under:<br/>Ahsanuddin Choudhury, J. relying upon the decision in the case of Joygun Bibi Vs. State 12 DLR (SC)151 and the case of Moqbul Hossain Vs. The State 12 DLR (SC) 217 observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>The retraction of a confession was a circumstance which had no bearing whatsoever upon the question whether in the first instance it was voluntarily made, and whether it was true. The fact that the maker of the confession later does not adhere to it cannot by itself have any effect upon the findings reached as to whether the confession was voluntary, and if so, whether it was true. The retraction of the confession was wholly immeterial once it was found that it was voluntary as well as true.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>There are other decisions too. But it will not, perhaps, be helpful to place more decisions on the same point. From all the decisions mentioned above we find that it has been firmly settled by judicial pronouncements that once a confession is found to be true and voluntary, the retraction of confession will be of no help to the confessing accused.<br/><br/>         As per the above pronouncements, there is no diffically in law to convict accused Md. Tohurul Islam @ Azizul Hoque and accused Nurul Islam @ Shine though they retracted their confession. We have already found that their confessions are voluntary and true.<br/> <br/>In respect of imposition of quantum of sentence, the learned Lawyer appearing for the condemned prisoners refers to the case of Lal Singh vs Emperor 40 Cr LJ Allahabad 132 and submits that Court has the power to give lesser sentence under section 396 of the Penal Code, though under section 302 of the Penal Code the rule is that a sentence of death should follow unless reasons are shown for giving lesser sentences, but no such rule applies to section 396 of the Indian Penal Code. Let us have a quick glimpse of the decision of the above case, that is, Lal Singh vs Emperor 40 CrLJ Allahabad 132 which runs as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“There remains the question of sentence. It is true that a man was wounded in the dacoity and eventually died. It is also true that the accused carried a gun in this dacoity. But it is stated that there were several guns carried in this dacoity and none of the witnesses say that the accused was the man who fired the shot which had fatal effects. We do not consider that as a general rule a sentence of death should necessarily follow a conviction under section 396, Indian Penal Code, and this section differs from section 302, Indian Penal Code in that respect. The rule is under section 302 that a sentence of death should follow unless reasons are shown for giving a lesser sentence, no such rule applies to section 396, Indian Penal Code. Accordingly, we find no reason in this case why the sentence of death should be imposed. We, therefore, maintain the conviction of Lal Singh under section 396, Indian Penal Code, and we reduce the sentence from a sentence of death to a sentence of transportation for life.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Therefore, according to the decision cited above there is scope in law to give lesser sentence in section 396 of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/>In fact, it is said that the most difficult task of a Judge is to decide what would be the quantum of sentene to be awarded upon an accused for committing an offence. It is not possible to lay down any cut and dry formula for imposition of sentence upon the accused. In the case of the State vs Rokeya Begum @ Rokeya Begum (condemned-prisoner) reported in 13 BLT 337, it has been held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Sentencing discretion on the part of a Judge is the most difficult task to perform. It is, also, not possible to lay down any cut and dry formula for imposition of sentence, but the object of sentence should be to see that crime does not go unpunished and the victim of crime as, also, the society has the satisfaction that justice has been done. It will be a mockery of justice to permit the accused to escape the extreme penalty of law when faced with such evidence and cruel act perpetrated by the offenders. To give lesser punishment to the condemned-prisoners who stand convicted in a shocking and revolting crime would render the Justicing System of the country suspect. Sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more harm to Justice System to undermine public confidence in the efficacy of law.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Madan Gopal Kakkad vs Naval Dubey reported in 3 SCC (1992)204, it has been observed as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“We feel that Judges who bear the Sword of Justice should not hesitate to use that Sword with the utmost severity, to the full and to the end, if the gravity of the offfence so demands.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>We consider that both the above desicions are very good guideline for the Judges to decide the quantum of sentence to be imposed upon the accused who have committed the offence.<br/> <br/>Considering the decisions cited above, the evidence on record and the circumstances, we are of the opinion that justice will be met if the impugned order of conviction and sentence of death of accused, namely,</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Md. Nurul Islam @ Shine @ Tapash @ Tonmoy, son of Habibur Rahman @ Habib master; and</li><li style="text-align:justify">Md. Tohurul Islam @ Azizul Haque son of Monirul Islam is maintained;</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">and the order of conviction and sentence so far as it relates to condemned prisoners, namely,</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Md.

However, accused Haji Azimuddin will get the benefit of section 35 A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/> <br/>Before parting with the judgment, we like to record our some observations in respect of certain points of criminal justice.<br/> <br/>We, as the part of the judiciary, strongly believe that time has come to do something for the condemned prisoners. We find that the condemned prisoners are supposed to walk to the gallows but unfortunately they are not getting opportunity to defend themselves properly. Against this background of inadequate opportunity for the condemned prisoners to defend themselve, we are inclined to record some of our observationsons on certain points of criminal justice. The observations are:</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li style="text-align:justify">In a death reference case almost all the condemned prisoners who are destined to walk to the gallows cannot afford to engage Lawyer to defend their case. According to the provisions of the Legal Remembrancer’s Manual, the condemned prisoners are provided with State Defence Lawyer. It is better, less we say, about the competence of the State Defence Lawyers. The State Defence Lawyers are appointed by the learned Solicitor of the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs. This Court notes with utter dismay that the Solicitor wing of the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs appoints the State Defence Lawyers who have very minimum knowledge about criminal cases of grave nature, like sections, 302, 396 of the Penal Code etc. We could not just allow the condemned prisoners to walk to the gallows without giving them an opportunity of being defended by a competent Lawyer. Obviously, the responsibility is upon the State. Our Human Rights Organisations sometimes are doing laudable jobs and, we believe that they may also do something for the condemned prisoners who are destined to walk to the gallows without any opportunity of being defended by the competent Lawyers. We would appreciate if our Human Rights Organisations also look into the matter and take proper steps in this regard. In fact, walking to the gallows without an opportunity of being defended by a competent Lawyer is the worst form of violation of human rights. We would, therefore, expect that the Human Rights Organisations would take steps to include the matter of defending the condemned prisoners in their agenda. The minimum that they can do, they can appoint a pannel of competent Lawyers to defend the condemned prisoners who could not appoint Lawyer of their own choice because of poverty and other reason.</li><li style="text-align:justify">All State Defence Lawyers have a common grievance that they are given very minimum amount as ‘fees’ for attending the court to defend the condemned prisoners. We expect that the Solicitor wing of the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs shall take proper steps to enhance the ‘fees’ of the State Defence Lawyers so that they get the reasonable fees.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">         The Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs last revised the fees of the State Defence Lawyer on 16.11.2006. Already 8(eight) years have passed since then and the State Defence Lawyers are given the same amount of fees which was fixed in 2006. This is simply denying justice to the learned State Defence Lawyer. Let us quote the last G.O. dated 16.11.2006 issued by the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs which runs as under:</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;">সংশোধিত জি,ও<br/><u>একই নম্বর ও তারিখের সহলাভিষিত্তু হইবে।</u><br/>গণপ্রজাতমএী বাংলাদেশ সরকার<br/>অাইন, বিচার ও সংসদ বিষয়ক মমএণালয়<br/>সলিসিটর উইং, হিসাব শাখা<br/>অ্যাটর্নি জেনারেল ও সলিসিটর কার্যালয় ভবন,<br/><u>বাংলাদেশ সুপ্রীম কোর্ট প্রাঙ্গণ, ঢাকা।</u></div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;">নং- সল-হিসাব-৯৭/২০০৬-১৫৪৫                                  তারিখঃ ১৬/১১/২০০৬ ইং।</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>প্রেরকঃ    শিরীন কবিতা আখতার,        <br/>            উপ-সলিসিটর।<br/>প্রাপকঃ    প্রধান হিসাব রক্ষন কর্মকর্তা,<br/>            অাইন, বিচার ও সংসদ বিষয়ক মমএণালয়,<br/>            এ, জি, বি ভবন, সেগুন বাগিচা, ঢাকা।<br/><br/>বিষয়ঃ রাষ্ট্রপক্ষে নিযুত্তু স্টেট ডিফেন্স ল'ইয়ারগনের দৈনিক শুনানী ফি/সম্মানী ভাতা বৃদ্ধিকরণ প্রসঙ্গে।<br/>         উপরোত্তু বিষয়ে নির্দেশিত হইয়া জানানো যাইতেছে যে, সরকার বাংলাদেশ সুপ্রীমকোর্টে রাষ্ট্রপক্ষে নিযুত্তু স্টেট ডিফেন্স ল'ইয়ারগনের দৈনিক শুনানী ফি/সম্মানী ভাতা পূর্ববর্তী সকল সরকারী অাদেশসমূহ বাতিলত্রুমে ১২০/-(একশত বিশ) টাকার সহলে <u>৩০০/- (তিনশত) টাকা নির্ধারণ করিলেন এবং প্রতি মামলায় সর্বোচ্চ অনধিক ২,০০০/-(দুই হাজার) টাকা ফি/সম্মানী ভাতা পাইবেন।</u><br/>এই সিদ্ধামেত অর্থ মমএণালয়ের সম্মতি রহিয়াছে। অর্থ মমএণালয়ের নথি নং-অম/অবি/প্রবি------/সম্মানী ৪/২০০৬ এর নোটানুচ্ছেদ ৫৬-৬০ দ্রষ্টব্য।<br/>         এই অাদেশ ০১.১১.২০০৬ ইং তারিখ হইতে কার্যকর হইবে।<br/><br/>স্বাক্ষরিত<br/>(শিরীন কবিতা অাখতার)<br/>উপ-সলিসিটর<br/>ফোন-৯৫৫৬১১৯ (অঃ)<br/>নং- সল-হিসাব-৯৭/২০০৬-১৫৪৫                                  তারিখঃ ১৬/১১/২০০৬ ইং।<br/>অনুলিপি ও প্রয়োজনীয় ব্যবসহা গ্রহণের জন্য প্রেরণ করা হইলঃ<br/>১।      অ্যাটর্নি জেনারেল অব বাংলাদেশ, ঢাকা।<br/>২।      সিনিয়র সহকারী সচিব দেওয়ানী/রীট/ফৌজদারী/এ, টি ও এ, এ, টি শাখা, অাইন, বিচার ও সংসদ বিষয়ক মমএণালয়, সলিসিটর উইং, অ্যাটর্নি জেনারেল ও সলিসিটর কার্যালয় ভবন, ঢাকা।</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: right;">সাক্ষরিত<br/>৩/৫/০৭<br/>(মোঃ মাইনুল হক)<br/>সিনিয়র সহকারী সচিব<br/>ফোন-৭১১০৯৫৫ (অঃ)<br/>(emphasis supplied)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>We consider that the above fee is too meagre for a State Defence Lawyer. It is not even befitting for a practicising Lawyer of the High Court Division of the Supreme Court. We find that already 8(eight) years have passed since the last G.O. was issued. Therefore, we consider that it is high time to revise the G.O. fixing the fees of the State Defence Lawyer without further delay. We strongly believe that the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamantary Affairs shall issue the new G.O. within short possible time superceeding all earlier G.Os. and fix the fees of the learned State Defence Lawyers commensurate to their services and status. The State Defence Lawyers are doing the sacred job of saving the neck of a human being. So, there is no scope to take the matter lightly, rather it should be taken into consideration with utmost seriousness.<br/> <br/>With these observations we like to conclude our judgment.<br/> <br/>At the end we wish to express our sincere appreciation to Dr. Md. Bashir Ullah, the learned Deputy Attorney General and his team for their lucid expression of law and for the invaluable assistance to this court.<br/> <br/>Let a copy of this judgment and order be sent to the Tribunal for information and taking necessary action.<br/><br/>         Send down the lower court records with a copy of this judgment to the Tribunal at once.<br/>      <br/>        Let a copy of this judgment be sent to:</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Secretary, Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs (Attention: learned Solicitor) for taking necessary action as per the observasation made in the body of the judgment at para ‘A’ and ‘B’.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Chairman, Human Rights Organisations to take necessary action as per the observation made in the body of the judgment at para ‘A’.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>
