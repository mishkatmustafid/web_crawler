Even the Charge sheet that has been filed in the present case can not be treated as complaint in as much as the said charge sheet being a police report can not be regarded as a complaint within the meaning of section 4(1)(h) of the Code of Criminal Procedure that is the complain  given under the section excluded the report of a  police officer. The lodgment of the F.I.R by the sub inspector of police Md. Mizanur Rahman, submission of charge  sheet dated 1.6.2007 by S.I. Mohammad Shahid Uddin and cognizance taken by the tribunal and therefore framing of charge by the said tribunal against the appellant in the present case be contrary to and in violation of requirements of section 23(2) and (3) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947 are bad in law. In the present case the police officer along with the combined force has in contravention of the safe guard provided in </strong><strong>section 23 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation</strong><strong> Act, 1947 initiated the present criminal case against the appellant by lodging the F.I.R treating the alleged offence under the said Act. Neither getting any letter of authority nor it has been lodged by the Bangladesh Bank. Though a permission has been given by the Bangladesh Bank about one month later from the date of occurrence  as well as arrest of the appellant and on consideration  the evidence  of P.W. 18 who issued letter  of permission  ext. 7 after 1 month without  any reasons  thus a suggestion was given  from the defence  as mechanical permission so the FIR. itself is a malafide one under the facts and circumstances of the case. The lodgment of the F.I.R can not be construed to have accorded the requisite authority to the informant to lodge the present criminal case against the appellant under the Foreign Exchange Regulation. So the initiation of the present case have not been validly initiated in terms of the requirements of Section 23 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act. . . .

(1) The Government of Bangladesh Bank may, at any time cause an inspection to be made by one or more of its officers, of the books of accounts and other documents of any person firm or business organization or concern required to submit to the Bangladesh Bank any return, statement or information under this act and, where necessary , direct all such books of accounts and  other documents to be seized.<br/>         (2) Every such person, firm, business organization and concern shall produce books of accounts and other documents and furnish such statements and information to such officer or officers in connection with the inspection under Sub- section (1)<br/>         (3) Failure to produce any books of accounts or other documents or to furnish any statement or information required under Sub- section (2) shall be deemed to be contravention of the provisions of this Act.<br/>         23. (1) Whoever contravenes, attempts to contravene or abets the contravention of any of the provisions of this  Act or of any rules, direction or order made thereunder shall not withstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure , 1898 be tried by a Tribunal constituted by section 23 A and shall be punishable with imprisonment for a  term which may extend to two years or with fine or  with both and any such Tribunal trying any such contravention may, if it thinks fit and in addition to any sentence which it may impose for such contravention , direct that any currency, security , gold or silver or goods or other property in respect of which the contravention has taken place shall be confiscated,<br/>         (2)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 , any offence punishable under this section shall be cognizable for such period as the Government may from time to time, by notification in the official Gazette declare,<br/>         (3) A Tribunal shall not take cognizance of any offence punishable under this section and not declared  by the Government under the proceeding Sub- section to be cognizable for the time being or of an offence punishable under section 54 of the Income -tax Act, 1992 (IX of 1922) an applied by section 19 , except upon complaint in writing made by a person authorized by the Government or the Bangladesh Bank in this behalf.<br/>         Provided that where any such offences is the contravention of any of the provisions of this Act or any rule, direction or order made thereunder which prohibits the doing of any act without permission and is not declared by the Bangladesh Government under the preceding Sub- Section to be cognizable for the time being, no such complaint shall be made unless the person accused of the offence has been given an opportunity of showing that he had such permission. <br/>         (4) Where the person guilty of an offence under this Act is a company or other body corporate every Director Manager, Secretary and other officer thereof who is knowingly a party to the offence shall also be guilty of the same offence and liable to the same punishment.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It appears from the above sections the government or the Bangladesh Bank has the power of inspection of the petitioner firm and thereafter the authority of Bangladesh Bank would to direct the appellant to produce the relevant papers and documents before the authority concern but in the particular case no such specific direction is available in the record and we also carefully read the section 23(1) of the said Act and it is apparently   shows that for commission of such offence of the said act, a complaint thereof can only be filed by a person authorized by the government or by the Bangladesh Bank. Further no such complaint can be filed unless the person accused of such offence has been given on opportunity to show cause that he had permission to do the act directed to submit account which in the absence of permission did not obey the direction in respect of submission of account properly would be a punishable offence under the act. The word complaint as appearing as sub- section -3 of Section 23 is not define in the said act.  In the absence of such definition in the foreign exchange regulation Act. The word complain should be taken to mean the complain defined under section 4 (1)(h) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Section 4(1)(h) reads as under “ 4(1)(h) complaint” . Complaint means the allegation made orally or in writing to a Magistrate with a view to his taking action under this Court that some person  whether known or unknown has committed an offence but it does not include  the report  of police officer.<br/><br/>The legal position as deducted from the above discussion that incourse of any contravention of any provision of foreign exchange regulation act etc.  Complained should be filed before the Magistrate by the person authorized in this behalf either by the government or by the Bangladesh Bank and not by lodging any F.I.R by any unauthorized police officer   and this apart, lodgment of such complain should be followed by an opportunity given to the accused person to show whether he had maintained his account properly or not.<br/><br/>But in the present case the F.I.R was lodged by the S.I. of police after about one month from the date  of his arrest and that was too without any authority which was required under section 23(3) of the foreign exchange regulation act 1947. Even the Charge sheet that has been filed in the present case can not be treated as complaint in as much as the said charge sheet being a police report can not be regarded as a complaint within the meaning of section 4(1)(h) of the Code of Criminal Procedure that is the complain  given under the section excluded the report of a  police officer.<br/><br/>It appears from the F.I.R as well as the P.W.1 the appellant has been arrested on the date of occurrence on 26.2.2007 without showing in connection of the case. For commission of the offence for dissimilarity of the accounts by seizing the currency and accounts books without giving him any opportunity to produce the same and then the F.I.R has been lodged on 26.3.2007 by getting permission from Bangladesh Bank on 25.3.2007 .<br/><br/>So, the lodgment of the F.I.R by the sub inspector of police Md. Mizanur Rahman ,submission of charge  sheet dated 1.6.2007 by S.I. Mohammad Shahid Uddin and cognizance taken by the tribunal and therefore framing of charge by the said tribunal against the appellant in the present case be contrary to and in violation of requirements of section 23(2) and (3) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947. are bad in law.<br/><br/>From the scheme of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947 can be said that the legislature wanted that any person accused of any offence for contravention of the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, etcetna should not be subjected to unnecessary harassment by the police and accordingly safe guard are provided in the act. But in the present case the police officer along with the combined force has in contravention of the safe guard provided in section 23 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947 initiated the present criminal case against the appellant by lodging the F.I.R treating the alleged offence under the said act. Neither getting any letter of authority nor it has been lodged by the Bangladesh Bank. Though a permission has been given by the Bangladesh Bank about one month later from the date of occurrence  as well as arrest of the appellant and on consideration  the evidence  of P.W. 18 who issued letter  of permission  ext. 7 after 1 month without  any reasons  thus a suggestion was given from the defence as mechanical  permission  so the FIR. itself is a malafide one  under the facts and circumstances of the case.<br/><br/>Under the above facts and circumstances, of the present case, the lodgment of the F.I.R can not be construed to have accorded the requisite authority to the informant to lodged the present criminal case against the appellant under the Foreign Exchange Regulation. So the initiation of the present case have not been validly initiated in terms of the requirements of Section 23 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act.<br/><br/>Moreover , it is admitted facts that the appellant is a bonafide business man and he is the proprietor of Jahan’s Money Exchange  which is also admitted by the P.W-11 A.K.M Fazlul Hoque, Assistant Director of Bangladesh Bank, Sylhet, in his evidence and he has also admitted that the appellant got the license on 19.10.1998 and he used to run his business regularly since then and  the said license was valid up to 18.10.2007 and the said money exchange enlisted to hold $ 25,000 dollars and we have also perused  the examination of the appellant under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure along with the papers and documents submitted by the appellant including his license where and account has been shown in respect of  US dollars 4755 by endorsing the photocopy of passport of different passengers an also accounts of $ 5476.85 from 12.02.2007 to 26.2.2007 along with the endorsement certificate and relevant photocopy of passport . We also considered the statement of D.W. 1 Md. Abu Bakkar Siddiqaue, Assistant Managing Director, Sonali Bank, Sonamgonj while he was performed as Assistant General Manager, Sonali Bank Darga Gate Branch, Sylhet on 19.2.2007 the appellant sold out 75135 pound and subsequently on scrutiny 2350 pound was found as torned and defective and that is why it was refunded to the appellant which is corroborated by D.W. 2 and it is also in the materials on record that the Bangladeshi taka which were seized from of the appellant the amount were drawn and deposited as business capital for foreign currency and it is for running his bonabide business and which does not constituted any offence of the said act. We find defense plea more probably then that of prosecution story and under above facts and circumstances and materials on record we find substances in the submission of the learned advocate for the appellant and therefore the appeal is succeeded.<br/><br/>The appeal is allowed, the impugned judgment and order dated 08..08.2007 passed by the Judge, Foreign Exchange Regulations Tribunal and Additional Sessions Judge , 1st Court, Sylhet in Foreign Exchange Regulation  Case No. 3 of 2007  is hereby set-aside and we directed the respondent to release the confiscated US $ 4745, &amp; Pounds 5476.85 Pounds and Tk. 27,80,222 at once in favour of the appellant and the appellant is also released from the surety of his bail bond.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
