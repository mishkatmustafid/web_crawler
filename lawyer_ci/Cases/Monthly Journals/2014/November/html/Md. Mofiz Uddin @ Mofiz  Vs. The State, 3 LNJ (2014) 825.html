It appears that as the murder of the wife Baby took place in the custody of her husband appellant in the same house. Then the appellant was under an obligation to explain how his wife had met with her death. No explanation was made by the appellant neither in the cross examination nor in the examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and in the absence of any explanation which is required under section 106 of the Evidence Act, it seems none other than the husband was responsible for causing the death of his wife. . . .

When intention to kill is lacking and therefore it is </strong><strong>not a culpable homicide amounting to murder</strong><strong> and hence alleged offence of murder does not fall within the provision of section 302 of the Penal Code rather the alleged offence comes under the provision of section 304 </strong><strong>part II of the penal code. In the result the appeal</strong><strong> is dismissed by altering the conviction and sentence to the effect that the accused Appellant Md.

About 2 years before at night about 1 and  A.M. after hearing hue and cry he went to the house of the accused Mofiz and he found the accused was confined and the brother in law of accused Mofiz and his vira were beaten to the accused. He also stated that accused Mofiz used to serve at Saudi Arabia from where he sent  money to his wife Baby Akhter and vira Joynal Abedin and he also heard that money was not given to his father. He did not say how Baby dead. He also stated that the character of Baby was not good. He also stated that the minor boy of Mofiz who is now residing with his grand father.<br/><br/>In his cross examination he stated that he did not know how the victim Baby died and he also did not say who killed her and he also stated that he deposed by hearing the said fact. He also stated that he saw the dead body of the wife of accused in the house of the accused situated at the north vity. He denied the suggestion that due to save the accused he deposed falsely. <br/><br/>It appears that the charge was framed against the accused Appellant by the Trial Court to the effect that<br/>আপনি আসামী ১৫.০৪.২০০৬ ইং তারিখ রাত ১.৩০ ঘটিকায় সময় মতলব থানাধীন ভেংগুরভিটি গ্রামাস্থ আপনি আসামীর বসত বাড়ীর বসত ঘরে আপনার স্ত্রী ভিকটিম বেবী আকতারকে মুখ মন্ডল মাটিতে চাপিয়া ধরিয়া গলা টিপিয়া হত্যা করেন।<br/><br/>To prove the said charge prosecution examined as many as 11 (eleven) witnesses out of which P.W.2 is the informant and brother of the victim Baby Akter who deposed that immediately after occurrence he came to the place of occurrence and found the dead body of his sister laying in the house of the accused and also found blood on the nose and eyes and mud on the face of her dead body. The accused made extrajudicial Confession for committing the offence of killing the victim. He found the accused in his house and these materials facts also corroborated by the other P.Ws 1, 3 to 8 in their evidences who are private witnesses who went to the place of occurrence immediately after occurrence although the said prosecution witnesses were neighbore and relatives of the informant as well as deceased baby Akter. Their evidence shows as practical and usual instead of mechanical and considering their evidences along with the evidence of P.W.9 investigating officer who proved the sketch map showing place of occurrence without any denial from the defence as mentioned above at the house of the accused. P.W.1 to 8 categorically stated that they found the dead body of Baby Akter on the floor of the house of the accused person and these material facts also admitted by D.W.1 and D.W.2 and therefore it is well proved that the occurrence took place in the house of the accused as well as in the custody of her husband, Accused Appellant on the said date and time of occurrence.<br/><br/>It further appears that the P.W.9 the investigating officer held surathal on the next morning of the occurrence and found  to the effect that “ইহাতে সন্দেহ হয় যে, ভিকটিম বেবী আক্তারের স্বামী মফিজউদ্দিন তাহার আরও সহযোগী সহ রাত্রির যে কোন সময় বেবী আক্তারকে বালুর মধ্যে মুখ মন্ডল চাপিয়া ধরিয়া হত্যা করিয়া থাকিতে পারে’’<br/><br/>and on the said date post Mortem held by the Doctor P.W.11 found the injuries on the face and cyanosed up to chest wall with presence of mud and dust on the face and nostrils and found injury at the right side of the face and opined that death was due to asphyxia resulting from combined effect of strangulation as well as suffocation which was antimortem and homicidal in nature and the evidence of P.W.11 Dr. who held post mortem was not shifted by cross examination in any manner.  Considering the surathal Report of the victim post Mortem report along with the depositions of prosecution witnesses we find  consistency to prove the charge of killing the victim Baby Akter by her husband the accused appellant while she was in the custody of the Appellant as in the time and place at the residence of Appellant by strangulation and suffocation by her husband the Appellant. It also appears that the accused was arrested immediately after occurrence from his house by the police of concern police station P.W.9 and he made a confession on the next day before the Magistrate 1st class who recorded the confessional statements as per Law and Rules by P.W.10 and that  confessional statement of the appellant was proved .<br/><br/>After analysis the evidence set out above it appears that the prosecution has satisfactorily proved that the victim Baby Akhter died as a result of strangulation on the date, time and the place as alleged by the prosecution. Such evidence has been furnished by almost all the witnesses including P.W. 11 the doctor who conducted the post mortem examination on the person of the deceased. Death in his opinion, was due to asphyxia resulting from combined effect of strangulation as well as suffocation which was antimortem and homicidal in nature. In his opinion it is consisted with the description of the injury and inquest report ext. 3. We, therefore, find that the victim Baby Akhter died due to strangulation.  As to the responsibility for causing the murder there is no direct evidence of the occurrence. The prosecution sought to prove the charge on certain circumstantial facts as well as the confessional statement of the appellant Ext. 6 Admittedly the appellant and the victim Baby Akhter were husband and wife. The evidence of PWs. 1,2,5,7 and 8 disclosed that the victim met her death while she was living with her husband in the same house of the accused. It was also appears that the dead body of the victim was found in the house of the appellant as disclosed by the P.Ws. 1-8 and this material facts also admitted by the witnesses of the accused D.W.1 and D.W.2  and said witnesses also deposed that the accused was present there. The death of the wife being caused by strangulation as already found by us, it was quite natural for the husband to send an information to the Police station. The accused did not take any step to that aspect. On the other hand, it appears that immediate after the occurrence  while P.Ws. 2,5,6,7 and 8 went to the house of the place of occurrence at that time the accused disclosed that he committed the murder of his wife Baby and similarly the accused  made confession in presence of  P.Ws. 1, 3 and 4 by sitting at the police station that he committed murder of the victim by strangula-tion and the evidences of D.W. 1 disclosed that he saw the dead body of the victim Baby on the night and D.W.2 also admitted during existence the relationship as husband and wife the dead body of victim Baby found in the house of the accused Mofiz. So we find the murder of the victim Baby Akhter took place while the accused appellant remained as husband wife with the victim and was in the same house and that house owned by the accused Mofiz. Ordinarily an accused has no obligation to account for the death for which he is placed on trial. It appears that as the murder of the wife Baby took place in the custody of her husband appellant in the same house. Then the appellant was under an obligation to explain how his wife had met with her death. No explanation was made by the appellant neither in the cross examination nor in the examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and in the absence of any explanation which is required under section 100 of the Evidence Act. Thus it seems none other than the husband was responsible for causing the death of Baby Akhter. In addition to the said circumstantial facts there is the confessional statement of the accused appellant marked as Ext. 7. The said statement has been quoted as under:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“আমার নাম মফিজ উদ্দিন মফিজ। আমিসৌদি আরবে ছিলাম। দেড়/ দুই মাস আগেদেশে ফিরি । গত ১৪/৪/২০০৬ তাং রাত ১/৩০ ঘটিকায় আমার স্ত্রীর সাথে টাকা পয়াস নিয়ে কথা কাটাকাটি হয় । এক পর্যায়ে আমি তাকে থাপ্পর মারি। সে আমার নিম্মাংগে চাপ দিয়ে ধরে। আমি তাকে গলায় চেপে মাটিতে চাপ দিয়ে ধরি। আমি ভাবি নাই সে মারা যাবে|”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It was recorded by P.W.10 the Magistrate 1<sup>st</sup> Class at that relevant time. The confessional statement appears to have been made in the prescribed form. The Magistrate stated that he recorded the said statement after observing all the legal formalities in recording as required under law and gave 3 hours time to the maker of the statement for his reflection. It also transpires from Ext. 6 that the maker of the statement was placed in charge of a peon in his chamber and there was no police. He explained to the confessing person that he was not bound to make the confession and if he does so that may be used against him. This P.W. also said that the confessional statement of the appellant appeared to him to be voluntary and true and he read it over to the accused who put his signature admitting that it had been correctly recorded and he also stated that in course of recording he did not see any injury on the body of the accused and the accused also did not state any allegation of torture to him and the incurable confession was made at the first instance while appears before the Magistrate without taking him any remand for the said confession Ext. 7 is very much consistent with her surathal report and post Mortem report. That the confessional statement in the earliest point of time, corroborated in respect of  place, time and manner of occurrence so confession was also proved as voluntary and true, though subsequently the appellant filed an application for retraction of his confession. In his application he stated that due to fear and torture he made confession. On the other hand P.W. 10 Magistrate who recorded the said statement who was not suggested to that effect by the defence and in such situation the defence can not be curable. We considered the confessional statement itself as it appears that the confessional statement made voluntarily. We also considered the contention of the confession it shows that there was a altercation regarding monetary transaction between husband and wife and the monetary transaction is supported and corroborated by PW 2 the informant and other pws 3 to 8. and as well as D.W 1 and 2 and altercation took place between husband and wife in the night at the date of occurrence in the residence of the accused and gave fist thump blow subsequently the victim caught hold the lower part of the accused and then he strangulated her throat and he also stated that he did not think over that his wife would met her death. This confession shows that even no deadly weapon has been used no prior intention to kill his wife Baby Akter is available in the facts of the case and there was no pre-medition to kill the victim. The killing took place through altercation due to monetary transaction between husband and wife and also from sudden fight between husband and wife and in such facts and circumstance as discussion above we find that the accused Appellant had no prior intention to kill his wife Baby Akter and there was no pre-medition to kill the victim even no deadly weapon has been used for causing grievous injury upon the victim. It is also noticed that immediately after occurrence the mother of the appellant informed the sister in Law of the victim P.W.5 jaynal Abadin and the Appellant was all along with the dead body till his arrest and he made confession instead to make any attempt to concealment the dead body as well as concealment to himself by making absconding or otherwise move over to some other place. Admittedly they have a child of 5 years. In view of the facts and attending circumstances of the case, we find that it was not a cool headed and premeditated murder, rather the fact of the case as disclosed that the incident took place out of altercation due to monitory transaction which has taken into such circumstances to commit the alleged offence of murder. When intention to kill is Lacking and therefore it is not a culpable homicide amounting to murder and hence alleged offence of murder does not fall within the provision of section 302 of the Penal Code rather the alleged offence comes under the provision of section 304 part II of the penal code.<br/><br/>In the result the appeal is dismissed by altering the conviction and sentence to the effect that the accused Appellant Md. Mofiz Uddin @ Mofiz is convicted under section 304 part II of the penal code and sentencing him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10(ten) years only instead of section 302 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>Send down the lower court records at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>
