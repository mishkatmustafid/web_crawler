There is however, no prohibition either expressly or by implication to move a review petition from the judgment of this Division on appeal from the judgment of the Tribunal. A plain reading of this non-obstante clause of the Constitution will manifest that a review petition from the judgment of this Division passed on appeal from the judgment of the Tribunal has not been ousted. Alternatively, it may be said that the power of this Division as the appellate forum to review its judgment has not been ousted either directly or indirectly by Article 47A(2). This will be evident from a close scrutiny of this provision and the Act of 1973. . . . (8)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 103</strong><br/><strong>An appeal against a conviction or sentence or an order of acquittal is essentially continuation of the original proceedings and all provisions applicable to the trial of the proceedings are also applicable in an appeal. The right of appeal, where it exists, is a matter of substance, not of procedure. To say otherwise, it cannot be said that the appellate court cannot invoke its inherent power if it finds necessary to meet the ends of justice or to prevent the abuse of the process of the court. There is inherent right to a litigant to judicial proceeding and it requires no authority of law, to see the correctness of the judgment. In an appeal entire proceedings are before the appellate authority and it has power to review the entire materials on record subject to limitations prescribed. If a party is affected by an order or judgment of the court, in the absence of specific provision for review, the court has inherent power to review its order or judgment. This Division can exercise inherent power as well. It is now established that inherent powers of the court can be exercised by a court of law at any stage of the proceedings. . . . (11 and 12)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 104</strong><br/><strong>If the law contains no specific provisions to meet the necessity of the case the inherent power of a court merely saves by expressly preserving to the court which is both a court of equity and law, to act according to justice, equity and good conscience and make such orders as may be necessary for ends of justice or to prevent the abuse of the process of the court. The court can use its inherent powers to fill up the lacuna left by the legislature while enacting law or where the legislature is unable to foresee any circumstance which may arise in a particular case. . . . (14)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Interpretation of Statute </strong><br/><strong>Where by use of clear and unequivocal language, capable of only one meaning, anything is enacted by the legislature, it may be enforced however harsh or absurd or contrary to common sense the result may be . However, where literal construction would defeat the obvious intention of the legislature and would produce a wholly unreasonable reason, the court must do violence to the words so as to achieve that obvious intention and produce rational result. If two interpretations of a provision is possible, the court will lean in favour of that construction which avoids absurdity and ensures smooth working of the system which the statute seeks to regulate. Where the usual meaning of the words do not convey the object or intention of the legislature, a more extended meaning may be given to them. If in a legislation, the general object of which is to benefit a particular class of persons, any provision is ambiguous so that it is capable to two meaning, one of which is to preserve the benefit and the other to take away the benefit, the meaning which preserve the benefit should be adopted. . . . (17)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Articles 47A and 104</strong><br/><strong>In appropriate cases, this Division on the doctrine  of <em>ex debito justitiae</em> may pass any </strong><strong>order by correcting mistakes in the judgment</strong><strong> but inherent powers of this Division may be invoked only when there does not exist any other provision in that behalf. However, in presence of specific provisions, it cannot invoke its inherent powers under Article 104. This Division can invoke its inherent powers, since the exercise of such powers have not been prohibited by Article 47A(2). Article 104 of the Constitution can be invoked to do complete justice only in a situation where justice cannot be effectively and appropriately dispensed with by the existing provisions of law. It is now established that where the question in dispute can be settled only through the provisions of a </strong><strong>statute, its inherent powers cannot be exercised</strong><strong> it is a corrective as well as residuary, supplementary and complementary to the powers specially conferred by the statute. . . . (23 and 24)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 104</strong><br/><strong>A review cannot be equated with an appeal. It does not confer a right in any way to a litigant. It is now settled point of law that a review of an earlier order is not permissible unless the court is satisfied that material error manifest on the face of the order undermines its soundness or results in miscarriage of justice. A review of judgment in a case is a serious step and the court is reluctant to invoke its power-it is only where a glaring omission or patent mistake or grave error has crept in by judicial fallibility. . . . (28)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 49 and 104</strong><br/><strong>If a death sentence is confirmed by this Division, the prisoner is put on further mental pressure under peril of death. It is not desirable to keep a person in such inhuman condition for indefinite period. He should be informed of his privileges to file a review or a mercy petition, as the case may be, as soon as the intimation about the confirmation of sentence is received by the jail authority and to fix a short date for execution until the existing rules are amended. The petition of review and mercy should be disposed of expeditiously as soon as possible. If the prisoner does not choose to avail of the privileges, the sentence should be executed on the date so fixed without delay, which have become ineffective under prevailing changed circumstances. . . . (34)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Jail Code, 1935</strong><br/><strong>Sub-rule (VI) of Rule 991 </strong><br/><strong>Though sub-rule (VI) of Rule 991 authorizes the Superintendent of Jail to fix a date for execution of the sentence not less than twenty one days ahead of the date on which he receives such intimation, this rule has rendered ineffective now. This time limit of twenty one days mentioned in the rule is for the purpose of enabling the condemned petitioner to move a leave petition before the Privy Council. In this case the appeals have already been disposed of by this Division. The question of disposal of a leave petition does not arise. After the disposal of the appeals, the authority has afforded him opportunity to file a mercy petition. Death row convict has a privilege to make a mercy petition and to make a review petition-these are neither constitutional nor statutory rights. However, as a last resort, the convict should not be deprived of these privileges. If he avails of the privileges, the execution of the sentence be postponed until those petitions are disposed of. . . . (35 and 36)</strong><br/><br/><strong>International Crime Tribunal Act (XIX of 1973) </strong><br/><strong>Section 19(3)</strong><br/><strong>The expression ‘common knowledge’ used in sub-section (3) of section 19 denotes facts that are commonly accepted or universally known, such as general facts of history or geography or the laws of the nature. When there is no direct evidence to connect the </strong><strong>accused with a particular incident even though</strong> <strong>the common knowledge points fingers towards</strong><strong> the accused, the Tribunals are given liberty to accept secondary sources, such as reports, </strong><strong>articles, books, video interviews treating them </strong><strong>as corroborating evidence without attempting </strong><strong>to collect primary sources of evidence because</strong><strong> the lapse of time impacts on the quality of evidence. . . . (42)</strong><br/><br/><strong>International Crime Tribunal Act (XIX of 1973) </strong><br/><strong>Section 19(2)</strong><br/><strong>International Crime Tribunal Rules</strong><br/><strong>Rule 53(ii) </strong><br/><strong>Reading section 19(2) and rule 53(ii), a conclusion that can be arrived at is that statement of a witness recorded by an investigation officer could be admitted in evidence if his presence before the Tribunal could not be procured or that he is not alive, otherwise not. Contradicting the statements of a witness can be drawn subject to the condition that it must be strictly limited to the subject-matter of the examination-in-chief only. Apart from contradiction of his earlier statements made to an investigation </strong><strong>officer, a witness’ credibility can be impeached</strong><strong> by extracting his knowledge about the subject on which he deposed, his motives to depose in the case, his interest, his inclination, his means of obtaining a correct facts to which he deposes, the manner in which he has used those means, his powers of disce-rning facts in the first instance, his capacity for retaining and describing them etc. The witness may also be cross- examined for the purpose of ascertaining his credibility. . . . (44)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872) </strong><br/><strong>Sections 137 and 155</strong><br/><strong>The object of cross- examination is to bring out desirable facts of the case modifying the </strong><strong>examination-in-chief. The other object of cross</strong><strong>-examination is to bring out facts which go to diminish or impeach the trustworthiness of </strong><strong>the witness. In examination-in-chief a witness</strong><strong> discloses only a part of the necessary facts, not merely because the witness is a partisan of the party calling him but also his evidence is given only by way of answers to specific questions, and the prosecuting counsel producing him usually calls for nothing but the facts favourable to his party. Cross- examination then has for its utility, the extraction of the remaining qualifying circumstances of the testimony given by the witness in his examination-in-chief. The credibility of a witness may be determined by way of cross-examination in respect of his integrity, his ability to disclose facts, his consistency in his statement. . . . (45 and 47)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872) </strong><br/><strong>Section 134</strong><br/><strong>Where the only witness, alleged to be an eye witness, is found to be highly interested in the prosecution, these facts are not by themselves sufficient for holding that he has also lied while narrating the principal events because the maxim “falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus”, has not been universally accepted </strong><strong>by the jurists of this sub-continent. A witness</strong><strong> is normally to be considered independent, unless he springs from sources which are likely to be tainted and he has no enmity against the accused to wish to implicate him falsely. The testimony of an eye witness which is natural as to the occurrence and whom one would expect to have seen the occurrence, cannot be doubted only because he happens to be related, or otherwise, to the party on whose behalf he gives evidence. . . . (48)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872) </strong><br/><strong>Sections 3, 118 and 155</strong><br/><strong>An eye witness who is a relative of the victim is a competent witness but his evidence cannot be accepted without close and careful </strong><strong>examination if it is found that other witnesses</strong><strong> were present at the scene of crime but the prosecution has withheld them without any </strong><strong>reasonable explanation, or unless the evidence</strong><strong> of this witness is shaken by cross-examination </strong><strong>or his demeanour is such as to lead one to the </strong><strong>inevitable conclusion that he has perjured himself-no court is entitled to discard evidence which are merely speculative. In order to judge the credibility of a witness the court is not confined only to observe the way in which the witness has deposed or the demeanour of the witness. It is open to the court to look into the surrounding circumstances as well as probability so that it may form a correct idea of the trustworthiness of a witness. The truthfulness or reliability of a witness must be tested by surrounding circumstances brought out in evidence. ...(49)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872) </strong><br/><strong>Section 155</strong><br/><strong>A witness can be held unreliable or his testimony can be deemed not credible if; (a) his statement is inherently improbable or contrary to the course of nature, that is to say, he says that he has identified the accused by face in darkness, or that he has recognized his voice from a mile away, or that he has seen the accused killing the deceased with a dao whereas the medical </strong><strong>evidence proved that the deceased succumbed</strong><strong> to bullet injury; (b) his deposition is contradictory or inconsistent i.e. at one place he says that “X” was the murderer but in another breath, he says it was ‘Y’; (c) if he is found to be biased or partial in relation to the parties in the cause; (d) his demeanour, </strong><strong>whilst under examination, is found abnormal</strong><strong> or unsatisfactory.    . . . (51)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 105</strong><br/><strong>It is an established jurisprudence that a review is by no means an appeal in disguise whereby an erroneous decision is reheard and corrected, but lies only against patent error of law. Where without any eleborate argument one could point to the error and say that here is a substantial point of law which stares one in the face, and there could reasonably be no two opinions to be entertained about it, a clear case of error apparent on the face of the record would be made out. It is only a clerical mistake or mistake apparent on the face of the record that can be corrected but does not include the correction of any erroneous view of law taken by the Court. An error is necessary to be a ground for review but it must be one which is so obvious that keeping it on the record will be legally wrong. The moot point is a party to litigation is not entitled to seek a review of judgment merely for the purpose of rehearing or a fresh decision of the case. The power can be extended in a case where something obvious has been overlooked-some important aspects of the matter has </strong><strong>not been considered, the court can reconsider</strong><strong> the matter. There are exceptional cases where the court can remedy its judgment. In the </strong><strong>alternative, it may be said that the error must</strong><strong> also have a material real ground on the face of the case. A petition over ineffectually covered ground or minor mistakes of inconsequential import does not call for review.  . . (57 and 58)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 105</strong><br/><strong>The powers of review can be exercised sparingly within the limits of the statute. In the realm of law the courts and even the statues lean strongly in favour of finality of decisions legally and properly made. If the cases are reopened on flimsy grounds which have already been addressed by the courts then there will be no end to the litigation. That is why; the power of review is restricted by given guidelines of the apex courts of the sub-continent. The power of the President to commute any sentence though is not subject to any constitutional or judicial restraints. It is intended to afford relief from undue harshness arising out of evident mistake. This is an executive power. The proceedings for commutation of sentence by the President being an executive character, a condemned prisoner has no right to insist on an oral hearing. The manner of consideration of such petition lies within the discretion of the President. Death row convicts are afforded such privilege of filing of a mercy petition as a last resort on humanitarian consideration, but it cannot be equated with a right of appeal which is a statutory right. The President may or may not commute the sentence but in respect of an appeal, the appellate court can set aside the conviction on a reappraisal of the evidence afresh. It is in rarest of the rare cases a mercy petition or a review petition is allowed. . . . (60 and  61)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Penal Code (XLV of 1860)</strong><br/><strong>Section 53</strong><br/><strong>The principles of sentencing procedure, are uniform in our country and the court while awarding a sentence shall consider (a) the nature of the offence, (b) the culpability of the offender, (c) the circumstances of its commission, (d) the age and character of the offender, (e) the injury to individuals or to society, (f) effect of the punishment on the offender, amongst many other factors which would ordinarily be taken in mind. While considering the punishment to be given to an accused person, the court should be alive not only to the right of the perpetrator, but also rights of the victims of the crime and the society’s reasonable expectation from the court for the proportionate deterrent punishment conforming to the gravity of the offence and consistent with the public abhorrence for the heinous crime committed by the accused person. . . . (73 and 75)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972 </strong><br/><strong>Article 105</strong><br/><strong>A review petition should not be equated with an appeal. In criminal matters, the power of review must be limited to an error which has a material, real ground on the face of the case. The finality attached to a judgment at the apex level of the judicial hierarchy upon a full fledged hearing of the parties should be re-examined in exceptional cases and a review is not permissible to embark upon a reiteration of the same points. . . . (81)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Jail Code, 1935</strong><br/><strong>Sub-rules (I) and (VI) of rule 991 </strong><br/><strong>If a warrant of death for execution is communicated to the Jail authority after it is confirmed or imposed by this Division, the condemned prisoner should be afforded an opportunity to file a mercy petition and he should also be afforded an opportunity to meet his near ones before the execution of the sentence. If the jail authority fixes a date for execution of the sentence, the same cannot be taken as has been done hurriedly. If any review or mercy petition is filed or pending, the sentence cannot be executed unless the petitions are disposed of. So, the period of seven days or twenty one days mentioned in sub-rules (I) and (VI) of rule 991 of the Jail Code have no force of law under the changed conditions. . . .

The former appeal was preferred by the Government against inadequacy of sentence passed by the International Crimes Tribunal No.2, Dhaka in ICT-BD Case No.2 of 2012, and acquittal in respect of charge No.4; the latter appeal was preferred by the convict Abdul Quader Molla against his conviction and sentence passed by the said Tribunal.<br/><br/>Abdul Quader Molla was arraigned before the said Tribunal to face six counts of charges. Charge No.1 is in respect of killing of Pallab, a resident of Taltala, Block-B, Section-11, Mirpur and a student of Mirpur Bangla College; charge No.2 was for the murder of poet Meherunnessa and other members of her family; charge No.3 was for the killing of Khandaker Abu Taleb, an imminent journalist and a lawyer, who is a resident of Section-1, Block-D, Road No.2, Plot No.13, Mirpur; charge No.4 was relating to mass killing at Bhawal Khan Bari and Ghotarchar (Shahid Nagar) of unarmed innocent civilians; charge No.5 was also relating to mass killing of 344 civilians of village Alubdi, (Pallabi, Mirpur) and the last charge was for the killing of Hazrat Ali Laskar, his wife Amena and two minor daughters Khatiza and Tahmina, rape of his three daughters and the killing of his two years old son. All the above incidents took place when the people of the country were fighting against the occupation army of Pakistan for liberation of the country. The petitioner, an activist of Islamic Chhatra Sangh not only collaborated with the anti-liberation force but also directly participated in the killing, rape and other nefarious activities with the occupation army and the local Biharis, a community of Urdu speaking minority, ostensible tools of their fellow Urdu Speakers of West Pakistani army backed Pakistani occupation army and involved in the atrocities.<br/><br/>These offences were perpetrated in Bangladesh following the onslaught of ‘Operation Search Light’ from the night following 25<sup>th</sup> March, 1971 to 16<sup>th</sup> December, 1971, by the Pakistani occupation army and their collaborators after the declaration of independence of the country by late Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. There were wide spread atrocities like killing of three million people, rape, arson and looting of unarmed civillians, forcing 10 million people to take shelter in the neighbouring country, India. The massacre ravaged Dhaka and other areas of Bangladesh, a display of stark cruelty, more merciless than the massacres by Genghis Khan or at Jallianwala Bagh by the British General Dyer. They did not spare the university teachers, intellectuals and the minority community at large. The International Crimes (Tribunals) Act, 1973 (Act of 1973) was promulgated for the purpose of detention, prosecution and punishment of persons committing atrocities during this period. The prosecution has examined twelve witnesses and the defence examined six. The Tribunal convicted the petitioner in respect of charge Nos.1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 and sentenced him to 15 years rigorous imprisonment in respect of charge Nos.1, 3 and 5 and imprisonment for life in respect of other counts. It, however, found the petitioner not guilty of charge No.4 and acquitted him accordingly.<br/><br/>This Division upon hearing the appeals held that Criminal Appeal No.24 of 2013 was maintainable, but allowed it by majority by setting aside the judgment and order of acquittal of charge No.4, and found him guilty of the said charge and sentenced him to imprisonment for life. It also sentenced him to death by majority in respect of charge No.6. This Division also dismissed the other appeal filed by the petitioner Abdul Quader Molla unanimously and maintained his conviction in respect of charge No.6. It, however, maintained his conviction and sentence in respect of charge Nos.1, 2, 3 and 5 by majority.<br/><br/>In the petitions though the learned counsel has taken ground Nos.9 and 12 respectively, he has pressed only three points presumably realizing that it would rather be a futile attempt to press other points since those points were raised and decided by this Division while disposing of the appeals. The first point urged is that this Division has committed error of law on the face of the record in failing to appreciate the material contradictions between the depositions of the witnesses and their statements made to the investigation officer of the case and that if such contradictions are taken into consideration, the conviction of the petitioner could not be sustained, not to speak of awarding him a sentence of death. The second point urged on behalf of the petitioner is that the warrant for execution of the sentence was issued by the Tribunal in violation of rule 979 of the Jail Code, inasmuch as, the sentence was given by this Division and therefore, the sentence could not be executed unless it was communicated by an officer of this Division, which is an error of law. The other point raised on behalf of the petitioner is that in exercise of its inherent powers under Article 104, this Division ought to have afforded the petitioner an opportunity to file a mercy petition in accordance with rule 991(I) and 991(VI) of the Jail Code.<br/><br/>Upon hearing the learned counsel it appears that the learned counsel has practically taken only one point from the impugned judgment of this Division and other points are consequences flowing therefrom, such as, the privileges that are available to the petitioner under the Jail Code, and a technical point as to the Tribunal’s propriety in communicating the warrant to execute the sentence. Before entering into the merit of the matter, the learned Attorney General has raised a preliminary point about the maintainability of review petitions. According to him, in view of Article 47A(2) of the Constitution, review petitions are not maintainable from the judgment of this Division, in the absence of any provision for review in the Act XIX of 1973. It is contended that against a conviction or sentence or an order of acquittal or inadequacy of sentence, there is only one remedy of appeal available to a convicted person and the Government and the informant and the complainant, as the case may be, can prefer an appeal under section 21 of the Act of 1973 before this Division. After the disposal of the appeals, the judgment has attained finality and it cannot be challenged by resorting to the constitutional provision, which has totally been ousted by the Constitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Act, 2011 and the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1973 respectively. It is added that no person to whom the Act of 1973 applies shall have the right to move this Division for any of the remedies available under the Constitution other than the one provided in the Act of 1973. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the review petition is maintainable in view of Article 105 of the Constitution read with Order XXVI of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh (Appellate Division) Rules, 1998.<br/><br/>When a preliminary objection is raised about the maintainability of a petition or appeal, the court is required to dispose of that point before entering into the merit of the matter. It is because if the petition for review is not maintainable, it would be a futile attempt to enter into the merit of the matter causing wastage of the valuable times of the Court. There is no doubt that the Act of 1973 is a special law, but it is distinguishable from other special laws in operation because this piece of legislation has been protected in respect of detention, prosecution and punishment of any person, who is a member of any armed or defence or auxiliary forces or any individual, group of individuals or organization who is a prisoner of war for Genocide, Crimes against Humanity or War Crimes and other crimes under International Law. Under the Act-such person cannot challenge the legality of the proceedings on any of the grounds contained in Articles 26, 27, 28, 31, 35, 44 by resorting to Article 102 or other provisions of the Constitution. Sub-clause (2) of Article 47A debars an accused person who is being prosecuted or punished under the Act of 1973 to move the High Court Division for any of the relief(s) available under the Constitution other than the one provided in the Act.<br/><br/>The intention of safeguarding this law is obvious-it is promulgated for trial of a person who has committed offences of Crimes against Humanity or War Crimes and other crimes under International Law. There is however, no prohibition either expressly or by implication to move a review petition from the judgment of this Division on appeal from the judgment of the Tribunal. A plain reading of this non-obstante clause of the Constitution will manifest that a review petition from the judgment of this Division passed on appeal from the judgment of the Tribunal has not been ousted. Alternatively, it may be said that the power of this Division as the appellate forum to review its judgment has not been ousted either directly or indirectly by Article 47A(2). This will be evident from a close scrutiny of this provision and the Act of 1973.<br/><br/>A subtle analysis of the relevant provisions of the Act of 1973 is relevant for our consideration. Sub-section (3) of section 11 provides that the Tribunal shall-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">a) confine the trial to an expeditious hearing of the issues raised by the charges.<br/>b) take measures to prevent any action which may cause unreasonable delay, and rule out irrelevant issues and statements.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>This provision clearly manifests that the trial of a case should be concluded expeditiously, and the Tribunal shall guard that any irrelevant issue or statement should not be allowed to be raised which may cause unreasonable delay in the disposal of a case. Section 13 of the Act restricts adjournment of the trial of a case unless the Tribunal is of the opinion that the adjournment is necessary in the interest of justice, that is to say, the Tribunal shall not allow any unnecessary adjournment of the trial of a case. Even a time limit for disposal of an appeal has been specifically mentioned. Of course, this time limit is not mandatory. A combined reading of these provisions suggests the intention of the legislature that the trial of offences specified in the Act of 1973 should be concluded as early as possible. The object is obvious. There is already delay in undertaking the trial of the offenders of Crimes against Humanity, Genocide, War Crimes etc. because of political polarization in the country after the killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. People of the country want that the perpetrators of these heinous offences should be brought to justice and that the real story of our liberation struggle should be reflected in our nation’s history without distortion.<br/><br/>An appeal against a conviction or sentence or an order of acquittal is essentially continuation of the original proceedings and all provisions applicable to the trial of the proceedings are also applicable in an appeal. It is because a vested right in the categories of the persons mentioned in section 21 to avail of the remedy of appeal is given. This is a statutory right and the appeal is one in which the question will be whether the judgment of the Tribunal from which the appeal is sought was right on the materials which the Tribunal had before it. When a right of appeal is conferred by a statute it becomes a vested right. The right of appeal, where it exists, is a matter of substance, not of procedure. To say otherwise, it cannot be said that the appellate court cannot invoke its inherent power if it finds necessary to meet the ends of justice or to prevent the abuse of the process of the court. There is inherent right to a litigant to a judicial proceeding and it requires no authority of law, to see the correctness of the judgment.<br/><br/>In an appeal entire proceedings are before the appellate authority and it has power to review the entire materials on record subject to limitations prescribed. It has been observed in an unreported case in Shiv Shakti Coop. Housing V. M/s. Swaraj Developers, Civil Appeal No.3489 of 2003 by the Supreme Court of India that ‘<em>an appeal is continuation of the proceedings; in effect the entire proceedings are before the appellate authority and it has power to review the evidence subject to statutory limitations prescribed ....... A right of appeal carries with it a right of re-hearing in some way, as has been done in second appeals arising under the Code’</em>. I find no reason to depart from the above view. If a party is affected by an order or judgment of the court, in the absence of specific provision for review, the court has inherent power to review its order or judgment. This Division can exercise inherent power as well. It is now established that inherent powers of the court can be exercised by a court of law at any stage of the proceedings.<br/><br/>We cannot overlook the fact that the primary function of the judiciary is to do justice between the parties who bring their causes before it. If the primary function of the court is to do justice in respect of causes brought before it, then on principle, it is difficult to accede to the proposition that in the absence of specific provision the court will shut its eyes even if a wrong or an error is detected in its judgment. To say otherwise, courts are meant for doing justice and must be deemed to possess as a necessary corollary as inherent in their constitution all the powers to achieve the end and undo the wrong. It does not confer any additional jurisdiction on the court; it only recognises the inherent powers which it already possesses.<br/>If the law contains no specific provisions to meet the necessity of the case the inherent power of a court merely saves by expressly preserving to the court which is both a court of equity and law, to act according to justice, equity and good conscience and make such orders as may be necessary for ends of justice or to prevent the abuse of the process of the court. It is an enabling provision by virtue of which inherent powers have been vested in a court so that it does not find itself helpless for administering justice. The court can use its inherent powers to fill up the lacuna left by the legislature while enacting law or where the legislature is unable to foresee any circum-stance which may arise in a particular case. There is a power to make such order as may be necessary for the ends of justice and to prevent the abuse of the process of the Tribunal. The inherent powers of a Tribunal are in addition to and complementary to the powers expressedly conferred upon it by other provisions of the Act of 1973. They are not intended to enable the Tribunal to create rights for the parties, but they are meant to enable the Tribunal to pass such orders for ends of justice as may be necessary. Considering the rights which are conferred upon the parties by substantive law to prevent abuse of the process of law, it is the duty of all Tribunals to correct the decisions which run counter to the law.<br/><br/>We are not unmindful that the duty of the Court is not to enlarge the scope of the legislation. A court of  law cannot rewrite, recast, or reframe the legislation for the very good reason that it has no power to legislate. The power to legislate has not been conferred on a Tribunal or a Court. It cannot add words to a statute or read words into it which are not there. A Court shall decide what the law is and what it should be. A Court of course adopts a construction which will carry out the presumed intention of the legislature but can not legislate itself.<br/><br/>The courts should not give beneficial construction where by giving such construction the court would virtually re-legislate a provision either by addition, alteration or substitution of words-where the words used in a statute are capable of only one meaning from which the court may not depart; and when the provision is plain, unambiguous and does not give rise to any doubt as to its meaning. It has been observed in Chief Justice of A.P. V. LVA Dikshitulu, AIR 1979 SC 193, that where two alternative constructions are possible, the court must choose the one which would be in accord with other parts of the statute and ensure smooth, harmonious working and eschew the other which leads to absurdity, confusion or fiction, contradiction and conflict between its various provisions, or undermines or tends to defeat or destroy the basic scheme and purpose of the enactment.<br/><br/>There is a presumption that the authors of statutes intend results that are both rational and coherent and that human behaviour is guided by reason and purpose and seldom bizzare. It is, therefore, necessary to apply the principles of logic, both deductive and inductive, particu-larly in excluding from consideration facts and circumstances which are not relevant for determination of issues raised. (“The Role of Logic” in Reed Dickerson’s ‘The Interpretation and Application of Statutes’). Where, by use of clear and unequivocal language, capable of only one meaning, anything is enacted by the legislature, it may be enforced however harsh or absurd or contrary to common sense the result may be. However, where literal constru-ction would defeat the obvious intention of the legislature and would produce a wholly unreasonable reason, the court must do violence to the words so as to achieve that obvious intention and produce a rational result. (CIT V. National Jaj Traders, AIR 1980 S.C. 485) It is because, it may be presumed that the legislature does not intend any absurd result. If two interpretations of a provision is possible, the court will lean in favour of that construction which avoids absurdity and ensures smooth working of the system which the statute seeks to regulate.<br/><br/>It has been held in East Pakistan V. Sarafatullah, PLD 1970(SC)514 that it is an established rule that the courts will adopt that construction which will remove the lacuna and advance the purpose and object of the statute. Purpose and policy of law cannot be defeated by dry literal construction of a provision of law. An interpretation which promotes justice and equity should be preferred such constru-ction which would advance the policy of the legislation to extend the benefit rather than the one that curtails the benefit (India V. Pradeep Kumari, AIR 1995 SC 2259). Where the usual meaning of the words do not convey the object or the intention of the legislature, a more extended meaning may be given to them. If in a legislation, the general object of which is to benefit a particular class of persons, any provision is ambiguous so that it is capable to two meaning, one of which is to preserve the benefit and the other to take away the benefit, the meaning which preserves the benefit should be adopted. References in this connection are the cases of Mahadeo Lal V. Administrator General of West Bengal, AIR 1960 SC 936 and AIR Karmachari Sangh V. AIR Ltd., AIR 1988 SC 1325.<br/><br/>Mr. Razzaq submits that even if it is assumed that there is no provision under the Act or the Rules to file a review petition from the judgment of this Division, it can review its judgment for doing complete justice under Article 104 of the Constitution, and in appropriate cases, in order to meet the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the court, it can exercise its inherent powers. He has further submitted that apart from Article 104, this Division can invoke its inherent powers to review its judgment on the principle of justice, equity and good conscience. In support of his contention he has referred to the cases of Seraj Uddin Ahmed V. AKM Saiful Alam, 56 DLR(AD)41 and M. Amir Khan V. Collector Estate Duty, 14 DLR(SC)276.<br/><br/>In the above cited case of Seraj Uddin Ahmed, a writ petition was filed challenging an order of cancellation of lease in respect of a plot of land in Mohammadpur Housing Estate and allotting the same to writ respondent Nos.7 and 8. The High Court Division upon hearing the parties made the rule absolute declaring the order of cancellation to have been issued without lawful authority. The allotees filed review petitions against the judgment of the High Court Division whose right to the plot was said to have been affected by the judgment. The High Court Division rejected the review petitions summarily observing that petitions for review from judgment passed in writ jurisdiction were not maintainable. This Division was of the view that the High Court Division was in error in holding the above view, inasmuch as, the court is competent to exercise its discretion in a case where party seeking review of the judgment of a particular court upon placing materials which if would have been before the court the same would have not been the one the court has made and, in such a situation, “<em>the court for dispensation of justice is quite competent to recourse to a procedure, of which the same is the master, to advance the cause of justice as well as on the ground of equity and good conscience</em>.” The above view supports the views we have expressed in the preceding paragraphs.<br/><br/>In M. Amir Khan (supra), the question was whether a review petition is available in the absence of any guiding principles. The facts are that, five review petitions were filed under Article 161 of Pakistan’s late Constitution. No Act has been passed nor the Supreme Court made any Rules to define or limit its power of review when the petitions were filed during the relevant time. The language of sub-article (3) of Article 163 of the late Constitution was couched in wide terms of the full extent of the power of review contemplated by the Constitution as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“The Supreme Court shall have power to issue such directions, orders, decrees or writs as may be necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it.......”.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">It was held by Cornelius, CJ. that if the Supreme Court is vested with full power for doing complete justice, there is no reason why the exercise of that power would not be applicable only in respect of a matter coming up before the Supreme Court in the form of a decision by a High Court. There is no reason why that power in its full scope, should not also be applicable for the purpose of reviewing a judgment delivered by the Supreme Court itself; provided that there be necessity within the meaning of the expression ‘complete justice’ in exercise of that power. If any material irregularity, is found, and yet “<em>there be no substantial injury consequent thereon, the exercise of the power of review to alter the judgment would not necessary be required. The irregularity must be of such a nature as converts the process from being one in aid of justice to a process that brings about justice</em>”. His lordship then approving a dictum of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Northwest Frontier Province V. Suraj Narain Anand, PLD 1949 PC 1, held that the ascertainment of a breach by a mode of interpretation will not in all cases furnish good grounds for interference. For the interpretation of the Constitution and the laws is a function which is vested specifically in the superior courts of the country and while it is true that in doing so they will follow the generally recognized principles applicable to statutory interpretation, in elaboration of the rules contained in the interpretation of statutes. With the above findings, the review petitions were dismissed.<br/><br/>In appropriate cases, this Division on the doctrine of <em>ex debito justitiae </em>may pass any order by correcting mistakes in the judgment but inherent powers of this Division may be invoked only when there does not exist any other provision in that behalf. However, in presence of specific provisions, it cannot invoke its inherent powers under Article 104. This Division can invoke its inherent powers, since the exercise of such powers have not been prohibited by Article 47A(2). Though the Constitution has given wide power to this Division, it generally does not pass any order in contravention of or ignoring the statutory provisions nor the power is exercised merely on sympathy. This power is to be exercised sparingly in cases which cannot be effectively and appropriately tackled by the existing provisions of law or when the existing law cannot bring about complete justice between the parties.<br/><br/>Article 104 of the Constitution can be invoked to do complete justice only in a situation where justice cannot be effectively and appropriately dispensed with by the existing provisions of law. It is now established that where the question in dispute can be settled only through the provisions of a statute, its inherent powers cannot be exercised-it is a corrective as well as residuary, supplementary and complementary to the powers specially conferred by the statute. There is no doubt that this Division has ample power to give such directions as are necessary for ends of justice. This power has been recognized and exercised, by issuing necessary directions to fill in the vacuum till such time the legislature steps in to cover the gap. This power is not restricted by statutory enactments but it should be used sparingly.<br/><br/>So this Division cannot ignore the substantive provisions of statute and pass orders concerning an issue which can be settled only through a mechanism prescribed in another statute. It is not to be exercised in a case where there is no basis in law which can form an edifice for building up a super structure. This power cannot be used to supplant the applicable provision to the case. The Supreme Court of India in Poonam V. Sumit Tanwar, (2010) 4 SCC 460 held that in exercise of its powers for doing complete justice the court generally should not issue any direction to waive the statutory requirement. The courts are meant to enforce the law and therefore, are not expected to issue a direction in contravention of law or to direct the statutory authority to act in contravention of law.<br/><br/>Article 104 of the Constitution will have no application in this case for, the Act of 1973 is a protected law. Clause (2) of Article 47A takes away the right to move the Supreme Court for any of the remedies under the Constitution to a person to whom a law specified in clause (3) of Article 47 applies. What’s more, the right of appeal of a convicted person is given by the Act of 1973 and not by Article 103 of the Constitution. Therefore, if Article 103 is not applicable, Articles 104 and 105 will not also be applicable to review a judgment of this Division passed by it against the judgment of the Tribunal established under the Act of 1973. Naturally, the Supreme Court (Appellate Division) Rules, 1988 will also not be applicable.<br/><br/>Now the question is whether what would be period of limitation for filing a review petition from the judgment of this Division passed against a judgment of the Tribunal set up under the Act of 1973. In the Act as observed above, the trial of a case before the Tribunal shall be held expeditiously without undue delay. Since the scheme and object of the law manifest that the proceedings shall be concluded expeditiously, the period of limitation for filing such review petition shall be as early as possible. As per rules of this Division review petitions shall be filed within thirty days but this period of limitation is not only inconsistent with the provisions of the Act but also not applicable. We are also not unmindful that the convicted person should be given a reasonable time to file a review petition. What is reasonable time is a matter to be considered in the context of the matter. There is no hard and fast rule in this regard. An aggrieved party can file a review petition against any order of the Tribunal within seven days as per Rules framed by it. In the courts of small causes a period of fifteen days limitation is provided for filing review petition from its judgment. This has been done with a view to secure finality of litigation. In some cases it has been observed that if this bar of time is not placed on the power of review it would mean that a judgment can never become final. Taking into consideration the surrounding circumstances it is our considered view that fifteen days’ time will be a reasonable time. This will secure the ends of justice.<br/><br/>It must be borne in mind that, by assumption, every judgment passed by a court is a considered and solemn decision on all points arising out of the case, and further that every reason compels towards the grant of finality in respect of such judgments delivered by a court which sits at the apex of the judicial system. A review cannot be equated with an appeal. It does not confer a right in any way to a litigant. It is now settled point of law that a review of an earlier order is not permissible unless the court is satisfied that material error manifest on the face of the order undermines its soundness or results in miscarriage of justice. A review of judgment in a case is a serious step and the court is reluctant to invoke its power-it is only where a glaring omission or patent mistake or grave error has crept in by judicial fallibility. Despite there being no provision in the Act of 1973 for review from the judgment of this Division on appeal, securing ends of justice a review is maintainable in exercise of the inherent powers from the judgment of this Division subject to the condition that where the error is so apparent and patent that review is necessary to avoid miscarriage of justice and not otherwise, and the execution of a sentence shall be suspended till the disposal of the review petition if the same is filed within the period as above. In view of what is stated above, we find that the review applications are maintainable. This disposes of the preliminary point.<br/><br/>So after the finality of the judgment, if the jail authority fixes a date for the execution of the sentence in accordance with the orders of the government, the execution of the sentence be postponed till the disposal of the review petition if filed in the meantime. If a review petition is not filed, it can be filed within fifteen days from the date of intimation to the accused about judgment of this Division or from the date of receipt a certified copy of the judgment whichever is earlier. Even if no review petition is filed, ends of justice demands that the death row convict should be informed that he has a remedy for review, and if he expresses his desire to file such petition, fixation of the date for execution of the sentence be made giving him a reasonable time to file the review petition. There is no prescribed rule or law to fix a date for execution of the sentence after the intimation about the confirmation or imposition of death sentence by the highest Tribunal of the country. The jail authority shall fix the date in accordance with the orders of the Government as per sub- section (3) of section 20 keeping a reasonable time so that the review petition is disposed of. The jail authority should also afford the prisoner an opportunity to file a mercy petition and to inform him about the opportunity of filing a mercy petition.<br/><br/>Mr. Razzaq has submitted that the jail authority in violation of Rule 991(1) and 991(VI) of the Jail Code hurriedly fixed a date for the execution of the sentence without affording the petitioner necessary time required for filing review and mercy petitions as per law. Sub-rule (1) provides that immediately ‘<em>on receipt of a warrant for execution consequent on the confirmation by the High Court Division of a sentence of death, the Jail Superintendent shall inform the convict concerned that if he desires to submit a petition for mercy, it must be submitted in writing within seven days of the date of such intimation</em>’. Sub-rule (VI) provides that after intimation is received ‘<em>by government of the rejection by the Privy Council of an application for special leave to appeal or the dismissal of an appeal which has been admitted or if proof is not furnished before the date fixed that necessary papers, instructions and also funds have been sent to a firm of solicitors in England on behalf of the condemned prisoner, the District Magistrate and the Superintendent of the Jail will be informed by telegram and the Superintendent of the Jail will be authorized to fix the date of execution not less than twenty one days or more than twenty-eight days ahead of the date on which he receives such intimation’</em>.<br/><br/>Rule 991 of the Jail Code is an enabling provision providing the procedures for dealing with a prisoner whose sentence of death has been confirmed by the High Courts. Under these provisions a condemned prisoner has been given the privilege to file a mercy petition to the Governor- General or His Majesty the King Emperor and also a leave petition to the Privy Council after a death sentence is confirmed by the High Courts. If the convict files a mercy petition, the jail authority will communicate it to the  authority and the execution of sentence will be postponed pending a reply from the competent authority is received. If a leave petition is filed through jail, the Superintendent of Jail would communicate the same with a covering letter reporting the date fixed for the execution. The leave petition would be dispatched to England for disposal. The communication and the procedure of filing of such petitions would take some time. Pending a decision on both counts, the execution of sentence by the jail authority was considered to be in violation of the principles of natural justice. The leave petition had to be communicated to UK and the mercy petition to Calcutta (Kolkata). Considering that aspect of the matter, time limit of seven and twenty one days was mentioned in both sub-rules for getting the result of those petitions. The position then prevailing has been changed. Under the changed circumstances the distance for communicating those petitions has shortened considerably, but no corresponding amendment has been made in the Jail Code. Under the prevailing laws, in respect of all penal offences other than the Act of 1973, even after the confirmation of sentence by the High Court Division, the condemned prisoner’s right to file an appeal before this Division is guaranteed. Under the Act of 1973, the finality to a sentence is attained after the disposal of an appeal.<br/>These Rules were framed in 1936 and considering the then prevailing facilities, the topographical and geographical conditions of this region, the said time limit of seven days and twenty one days has been mentioned in these provisions. The present condition is totally different. If one looks at the purpose for which these time limit has been mentioned in the Rules, it can be inferred that it is only to afford all privileges to a condemned prisoner to file a mercy or a leave petition to the competent authority after the confirmation of death sentence by the High Courts for ends of justice.<br/><br/>When a sentence of death is passed, the condemned prisoner is confined in a secluded place without waiting for the confirmation of sentence, a cell, apart from all other prisoners. He is kept in isolation and the facilities that are given to a prisoner are restricted to him. The jailor shall have the prisoner stripped and searched-takes every article of private clothing and other articles from him-gives him a suit of jail clothing. Even visitation by his near ones is also restricted. Naturally a condemned prisoner would pass time with much mental agony and physical restraints. The moment a condemned prisoner is put in such cell, psychologically he is put on mental stress and agony. This mental agony is reached to such an extent that, sometimes some prisoners suffer a stroke and some of them suffer a mental sickness, resulting in loss of life before they are put to gallows. This is why, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh simplified the rules for preparation of paper book and gives special attention to hear death references on priority basis. Rules 979 to 1009 are applicable to such prisoners.<br/><br/>If a death sentence is confirmed by this Division, the prisoner is put on further mental pressure under peril of death. It is not desirable to keep a person in such inhuman condition for indefinite period. He should be informed of his privileges to file a review or a mercy petition, as the case may be, as soon as the intimation about the confirmation of sentence is received by the jail authority and to fix a short date for execution until the existing rules are amended. The petition of review and mercy should be disposed of expeditiously as soon as possible. If the prisoner does not choose to avail of the privileges, the sentence should be executed on the date so fixed without delay, which have become ineffective under prevailing changed circumstances.<br/><br/>Learned Attorney General submitted that after the communication of the warrant for execution of sentence to the jail authority, two Executive Magistrates in presence of the jail authority intimated the petitioner of his privilege to file a mercy petition to the President but, the petitioner declined to file such mercy petition. According to him, the plea of mercy is taken only to delay the execution of the sentence. Mr. Razzaq does not dispute the submission of the learned Attorney General. His only grievance is that the jail authority is trying to execute the sentence hurriedly. So, before fixation of a date for the execution of the sentence, the petitioner was informed about his privilege to file a mercy petition. Though sub- rule (VI) of Rule 991 authorizes the Superintendent of Jail to fix a date for execution of the sentence not less than twenty one days ahead of the date on which he receives such intimation, this rule has rendered ineffective now.<br/><br/>This time limit of twenty one days mentioned in the rule is for the purpose of enabling the condemned petitioner to move a leave petition before the Privy Council. In this case the appeals have already been disposed of by this Division. The question of disposal of a leave petition does not arise. After the disposal of the appeals, the authority has afforded him opportunity to file a mercy petition. Section 20(3) of the Act provides that the sentence awarded under the Act of 1973 shall be carried out in accordance with the orders of the Government. Death row convict has a privilege to make a mercy petition and to make a review petition-these are neither constitutional nor statutory rights. However, as a last resort, the convict should not be deprived of these privileges. If he avails of the privileges, the execution of the sentence be postponed until those petitions are disposed of.<br/><br/>On the other point raised by the learned counsel, it would be pertinent to examine some provisions of the Act. Section 6 of the Act enjoins the Government to set up one or more Tribunals, each consisting of a Chairman and not less than two and not more than four other members. The procedure provided for trial of offences under the general or other special laws applicable to Bangladesh are completely different from those provided in the Act of 1973, which is also a special law. Under the Act, the Chief Prosecutor or a Prosecutor appointed by the Government is entrusted with all the powers of investigation of a case with the assistance of an investigation agency and to conduct the prosecution against any person in respect of offences specified in section 3(2). Section 8(4) lays down the powers of the investigation officer. An investigation officer making an investigation in respect of any of the offences committed under the Act may examine orally any person who appears to be acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case. The investigation officer may reduce into writing such statement made to him in course of examination under section 8(4) of the Act-he is not bound to record any statement made to him. Chapter II under the heading ‘Powers and Functions of the Investigation Agency’, of the Rules framed by the Tribunal deals with the procedure for investigation in respect of any offences specified in section 3(2) of the Act. Rule 4 provides that the investigation officer shall act and work in accordance with the provisions of sections 8(1), 8(3), 8(4), 8(5), 8(6) and 8(7) of the Act while investigating a case.<br/><br/>Rule 6 empowers an investigation officer to investigate the facts and circumstances of the case and if necessary take steps for discovery and arrest of the accused. The investigation officer shall also maintain a case diary for each case until completion of such investigation but the said case diary can be used by such officer at the time of his deposition before the Tribunal and the Tribunal has also right to peruse the case diary for clarification or understanding any fact transpired at the time of investigation. The investigation officer may apply through the prosecutor to the Tribunal to commit any accused person in his custody for the purpose of interrogation for proper investigation of the case. Rule 18(2) provides that the investigation officer shall work with the prosecutor and shall assist the prosecutor in formulating a formal charge against an accused person.<br/><br/>Rule 19 enjoins the Chief Prosecutor to hold further investigation or to stop the investigation being conducted by the investigation officer if the latter does not find prima facie case against an accused person. These provisions show that the powers of the investigation officer in conducting the investigation are to be supervised and regulated by the Chief Prosecutor. So the powers exercisable by the investigation agency are completely distinct from those which are being exercised by an investigation officer under the Code of Criminal Procedure or under any other special laws. More so, the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Evidence Act are not applicable to the proceedings under the Act, 1973.<br/><br/>Under the Evidence Act the previous statement of a witness can be used (i) under section 145 to contradict the witness, (ii) under section 155 to impeach his credit, and (iii) under section 157 to corroborate his testimony. Section 162 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that no statement made by a person to a police officer in course of investigation under Chapter XIV shall be used for any purpose except by the accused for the purpose of contradicting the witness. Under the Evidence Act, if the accused intends to contradict a witness, his attention must be drawn to that part of the previous statement by which it is indented to contradict him. There is no corresponding procedure in the Act of 1973 or the Rules. Naturally the procedures of contradicting a witness by a previous inconsistent statement of a witness under the rules of the Evidence Act are not applicable in the  proceedings before the Tribunal. Rule 53 (ii) of the Rules states specifically that the cross-examination shall be strictly limited to the subject-matter of the examination- in-chief of a witness.<br/><br/>Now the question is in view of sub-section (2) of section 19, the Tribunal can take judicial notice of any statements recorded by an investigation officer which are inconsistent with the statements made in examination-in- chief before it. Section 19 of the Act and Rule 53(ii) are relevant to address the point raised at the Bar. These provisions read as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“19.(1) A Tribunal shall not be bound by technical Rules of evidence; and it shall adopt and apply to the greatest possible extent expeditious and non-technical procedure, and may admit any evidence, including reports and photographs published in newspapers, periodicals and magazines, films and tape-recordings and other materials as may be tendered before it, which it deems to have probative value. </em><br/><em>(2) A Tribunal may receive in evidence any statement recorded by a Magistrate or an Investigation Officer being a statement made by any person who, at the time of the trial, is dead or whose attendance cannot be procured without an amount of delay or expense which the Tribunal considers unreaso-nable. </em><br/><em>(3) A Tribunal shall not require proof of facts of common knowledge but shall take judicial notice thereof. </em><br/><em>(4) A Tribunal shall take judicial notice of official governmental documents and reports of the united Nations and its subsidiary agencies or other international bodies including non-governmental organizations.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Rule 53(ii) states;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“The cross-examination shall be strictly limited to the subject matter of the examination-in-chief of a witness but the party shall be at liberty to cross-examine such witness on his credibility and to take contradiction of the evidence given by him”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Section 19(2) shows that the statement recorded by an investigation officer in course of investigation can be used as evidence under two eventualities only-in case of death of the person whose statement has been recorded or when his attendance cannot be procured even after taking necessary measures and the Tribunal is of the opinion that the delay to secure his attendance would be unreasonable. The expression ‘common knowledge’ used in sub-section (3) of section 19 denotes facts that are commonly accepted or universally known, such as general facts of history or geography or the laws of the nature. When there is no direct evidence to connect the accused with a particular incident even though the common knowledge points fingers towards the accused, the Tribunals are given liberty to accept secondary sources, such as reports, articles, books, video interviews treating them as corroborating evidence without attempting to collect primary sources of evidence because the lapse of time impacts on the quality of evidence.<br/><br/>The statements of the witnesses are recorded by the investigation officers in the most haphazard manner. Officers conducting the investigation not unnaturally record what seem in their opinion material to the case at that stage and omit many matters equally material and, it may be, of supreme importance as the case develops. Besides, in most cases they are not experts of what is and what is not evidence. The statements are recorded hurriedly subject to frequent interruptions and suggestions from by-standers. All they cannot in any sense be termed depositions for, they are not prepared in the way of depositions, they are not read over to nor are they signed by the makers of the statements. There is no guarantee that they do not contain much more or much less than what the witness has said. Normally during investigation, it is the question posed to the witness that triggers the witness’ mind and memory. The witness hardly ever produces information spontaneously. Suppose an incident lasted for about 5/6 hours or even more. The situation was so complex that it would have been easy to write a book about that episode alone. The witness disclosed about what he was asked pinpointing a particular fact. Obviously further questioning is necessary to reticence all information from him. So leading questions which have not been banned at Tribunals are not only suggestive because the answer is included in it-the witness will then narrate by memorizing the old facts.<br/><br/>Reading section 19(2) and rule 53(ii), a conclusion that can be arrived at is that statement of a witness recorded by an investigation officer could be admitted in evidence if his presence before the Tribunal could not be procured or that he is not alive, otherwise not. Contradicting the statements of a witness can be drawn subject to the condition that it must be strictly limited to the subject-matter of the examination-in-chief only. Apart from contradiction of his earlier statements made to an investigation officer, a wrintess’ credibility can be impeached by extracting his knowledge about the subject on which he deposed, his motives to depose in the case, his interest, his inclination, his means of obtaining a correct facts to which he deposes, the manner in which he has used those means, his powers of discerning facts in the first instance, his capacity for retaining and describing them etc. The witness may also be cross-examined for the purpose of ascertaining his credibility.<br/><br/>It is to be remembered that the object of cross- examination is to bring out desirable facts of the case modifying the examination-in-chief. The other object of cross-examination is to bring out facts which go to diminish or impeach the trustworthiness of the witness. In examination-in-chief a witness discloses only a part of the necessary facts, not merely because the witness is a partisan of the party calling him but also his evidence is given only by way of answers to specific questions, and the prosecuting counsel producing him usually calls for nothing but the facts favourable to his party. Cross-examination, then has for its utility, the extraction of the remaining qualifying circumstances of the testimony given by the witness in his examination-in-chief.<br/><br/>Mr. Razzaq argued that the expressions “the party shall be at liberty to cross-examine such witness on his credibility” are sufficient to infer that the Rules have not debarred the Tribunal to take into consideration the statements of any witness made in the course of investigation to the investigation officer. The law as it stands, it is difficult to accept his contention. The basic principles of interpre-tation of statutes is that laws should be construed to carry out the intention of the legislature. The function of the court is to interpete a statute according to its intent. When the words are clear and unambiguous, it would not be open to courts to adopt any hypothetical construction. (Pakistan V. Akhlaque Hossain, 17 DLR(SC)545).<br/><br/>It should be borne in mind that apart from contradiction, the credibility of a witness may be determined by way of cross-examination in respect of his integrity, his ability to disclose facts, his consistency in his statement. This follows that in determining the credit of a witness various considerations have to be looked at by the Tribunal. In every case it is seen, a witness mixes a certain amount of untruth in his evidence even when he gives to substantiate a correct account. Part of this admixture of falsehood may be the result of inadvertence and may be the very natural vagaries of observation and memory. Obviously they should not affect the credibility of a witness at something by way of exaggeration, but even an exaggeration that is intentional could be discouraged without impairing the acceptability of the rest of the evidence provided that these super additions did not go to the root of the matter.<br/><br/>Where the only witness, alleged to be an eye witness, is found to be highly interested in the prosecution, these facts are not by themselves sufficient for holding that he has also lied while narrating the principal events because the maxim “<em>falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus</em>”, has not been universally accepted by the jurists of this sub-continent. One American author has stated that ‘<em>the maxim is in itself worthless; first in point of validity .... and secondly, in point of utility because it merely tells the jury what they may do in any event, not what they must do or must not do, and therefore, it is superfluous form of words’</em>. Where on the scrutiny of evidence, one finds that on the whole the evidence is more false than true, it would be dangerous to act upon it. A witness is normally to be considered independent, unless he springs from sources which are likely to be tainted and he has no enmity against the accused to wish to implicate him falsely. The testimony of an eye witness which is natural as to the occurrence and whom one would expect to have seen the occurrence, cannot be doubted only because he happens to be related, or otherwise, to the party on whose behalf he gives evidence.<br/><br/>An eye witness who is a relative of the victim is a competent witness but his evidence cannot be accepted without close and careful examination if it is found that other witnesses were present at the scene of crime but the prosecution has withheld them without any reasonable explanation, or unless the evidence of this witness is shaken by cross-examination or his demeanour is such as to lead one to the inevitable conclusion that he has perjured himself-no court is entitled to discard evidence which are merely speculative. In order to judge the credibility of a witness the court is not confined only to observe the way in which the witness has deposed or the demeanour of the witness. It is open to the court to look into the surrounding circumstances as well as probability so that it may form a correct idea of the trustworthiness of a witness. The truthfulness or reliability of a witness must be tested by surrounding circumstances brought out in evidence.<br/><br/>If there is any matter against a witness, no adverse inference can be drawn against him unless he has been given an opportunity to explain it. But in respect of crimes committed under the Act of 1973, because of the influx of time, most of the eye witnesses are not available and in some cases the witnesses are not willing to depose for fear or reprisal or for any other cause or the witness has lost interest by efflux of time. In respect of charge No.6, P.W.3 is the only surviving witness of the family. There was no scope to witness the incident by anyone other than this witness. The defence failed to shake her testimony in any manner. Mr. Razzaq finds it difficult to point out any inconsistency in her statements in the course of cross-examination. He, however, submitted that it was due to the fault of the defence counsel. P.W.3 was thoroughly cross-examined by the defence for two days but the defence failed to extract any inconsistency from her statements made in the Tribunal in any manner.<br/><br/>A witness can be held unreliable or his testimony can be deemed not credible if; (a) his statement is inherently improbable or contrary to the course of nature, that is to say, he says that he has identified the accused by face in darkness, or that he has recognized his voice from a mile away, or that he has seen the accused killing the deceased with a dao whereas the medical evidence proved that the deceased succumbed to bullet injury; (b) his deposition is contradictory or inconsistent i.e. at one place he says that “X” was the murderer but in another breath, he says it was ‘Y’; (c) if he is found to be biased or partial in relation to the parties in the cause; (d) his demeanour, whilst under examination, is found abnormal or  unsatisfactory. None of the above conditions is present in this case.<br/><br/>Apart from what is stated above, in the case in hand there are some uncontroverted, incriminating circumstantial evidence which corroborated the testimony of P.W.3. Therefore, there is no scope under the rules of evidence to infer contradiction in the statements of the witnesses with what they have stated to the investigation officer. This Division on a thorough assessment of the evidence of the witnesses came to a definite conclusion by majority that the witnesses are reliable and natural. There is no scope to infer otherwise in a review petition. In view of what is stated above, we are of the view that this Division has committed no error of law in holding that the cross-examination of a witness shall be strictly confined to the subject matter of the statements made in examination-in-chief of a witness. There is thus no merit in the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner.<br/><br/>The Tribunal, as per law, is not bound to follow the rules of evidence which are normally applicable in proof of a fact. It may admit a photograph or a news paper reporting or an article in a magazine in proof of a fact, if such fact is relevant to connect the accused with the incident for which he is being tried. The technical rules for admitting digital evidence are also not applicable and it can take films and tape recording statements, even a statement recorded by the investigation officer of any witness, who is dead or whose presence cannot be procured without delay and if the Tribunal feels that his statement is relevant to corroborate a fact in issue or which it deems to have probative value. This is because the trials are being held at a belated stage; most of the material evidence are lost in many cases; most of the members of the family were killed and the neighbouring witnesses escaped to avoid similar eventuality; the surviving witnesses are not interested to disclose the real incident because of the harrowing incidents of brutalities perpetrated against unarmed innocent people of the country by an organized armed force with the help of Razakars, Al-Badr, Al-shams and Peace Committee members for causes mentioned above.<br/><br/>Criminal law generally, whether municipal or international do not recognize the doctrine of limitation for trial of persons for War Crimes, Genocide and Crimes against Humanity. For this reason some serious violations that occurred in World War-11 in 1940s and in Indonesia in 1960s are being investigated and prosecuted now after lapse of time. In Bangladesh and Combodia, the incidents occurred in 1970 and 1971. The perpetrators are old, victims and their family members are also old although their wounds have not been healed up-the younger generation have limited knowledge of the atrocities caused by the perpetrators. Thus the focus is on the use of old evidence in respect of these crimes. Alphos M M Orie, a Judge of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia wrote in an article titled ‘Adjudicating Core International Crimes Cases in which Old Evidence is introduced’, that if someone gives testimony in court, it is quite hard to say whether it is old or fresh evidence. The legal approach does not produce a fully satisfactory answer to the challenges encountered when dealing with old evidence about events that have long since passed. The meaning of the word ‘evidence’ differs from one legal system to another. In case of inconsistent testimony with prior statements it was observed in some cases that this was due to ‘societal pressure on the witnesses’.<br/><br/>The memory of the witnesses who are still alive may be affected. They have spoken extensively with other victims or potential witnesses. Archives where these documents have been preserved have been destroyed by the interested persons taking advantage of change of political scenario. Potential witnesses have moved on to such an extent in their lives that they do not wish to reopen a traumatic past by co-operating with the prosecuting agency. So, witnesses’ evidence may be compromised by memory loss, a re-characterization of what happened helped along by express or implicit pressure from peers and interested groups, or unavailability. The prosecution banks upon one or two witnesses, reports, analyses, commen-taries and documentaries approaching the problems from all angles. Upon consideration of these factors this Division in its majority opinion observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“There is no provision either in the Act or the Rules affording guidance for the investigating officers similar to those provided under sections 161 and 162 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (the Code) and rule 265 of Bangladesh Police Regulations, Part One, for recording statements of witnesses in course of investigation of a case. Under section 161 of the Code, a police officer may examine orally any person supposed to be acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case and he may reduce into writing such statement made to him, and if he does so he shall make a separate record of the statement. Similarly rule 265 enjoins the police officers to record or note the statement of any witness examined by them. It further provides that the investigating officer should record statements in the language of the witness and it should be in full containing all the relevant facts connected with the case. During the trial ‘the court shall refer to these statements at the request of the defence and shall also furnish with the copies thereof’.<br/><br/>“According to proviso of section 162 of the Code, when a witness is called for, the prosecution in the trial, any part of his statement, if duly proved, may be used by the accused and with the permission of the court by the prosec-ution, to contradict such witness in the manner provided by section 145 of the Evidence Act. This enables the prosecution to explain the alleged contradiction by pointing out that if any part of the statement used to contradict be read in the context of any other part, it would give a different meaning; and if so read, it would explain away alleged contradic-tion. If one could guess the intention of the Legislature in framing section 162 of the Code in the manner it did in 1923, it would be apparent that it was to protect the accused against the user of the statements of witnesses made before the police during the investigation at the trial presumably on the assumption that the said statements were not made under circumstances inspiring confidence.<br/><br/>“This provisions of the Code are not applicable in view of section 23 of the Act, 1973, which debarred from applying the provisions of the Code and the Evidence Act in the proceedings under the said Act. The Rules are totally silent as to the manner of examination of a witness by the investigating officer. It may be either orally or in writing. Even if it is in writing, there is nothing in the Rules therein guiding the procedure and the manner of use of the earlier statement of such witness in course of the trial. Sub-rule (ii) of rule 53, speaks of ‘contradiction of the evidence given by him’. This word ‘contradiction’ is qualified by the word ‘examination-in-chief’ of a witness. So, the contradiction can be drawn from the statements made by a witness in his ‘examination-in-chief’ only, not with respect to a statement made to the investigating officer of the case in course of investigation.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The next question for consideration is whether there is error apparent on the face of the record which calls for interference of the impugned judgment. It is an established jurisprudence that a review is by no means an appeal in disguise whereby an erroneous decision is reheard and corrected, but lies only against patent error of law. Where without any eleborate argument one could point to the error and say that here is a substantial point of law which stares one in the face, and there could reasonably be no two opinions to be entertained about it, a clear case of error apparent on the face of the record would be made out. It is only a clerical mistake or mistake apparent on the face of the record that can be corrected but does not include the correction of any erroneous view of law taken by the Court.<br/><br/>Further, it has now been settled that an error is necessary to be a ground for review but it must be one which is so obvious that keeping it on the record will be legally wrong. The moot point is, a party to a litigation is not entitled to seek a review of judgment merely for the purpose of rehearing or a fresh decision of the case. The power can be extended in a case where something obvious has been overlooked-some important aspects of the matter has not been considered, the court can reconsider the matter. There are exceptional cases where the court can remedy its judgment. In the alternative, it may be said that the error must also have a material real ground on the face of the case. A petition over ineffectually covered ground or minor mistakes of inconse-quential import does not call for review.<br/><br/>This Division has repeatedly held that the court should not be oblivious of the theme that when the finality is attached to the judgment delivered by a court, particularly the judgments at the apex level of the judicial hierarchy, upon a full-fledged hearing of the parties, a review petition being neither in the nature of a rehearing of the whole case nor being an appeal against judgment, review is not permissible only to embark upon a reiteration of the same contention which were advanced at the time of hearing of the appeal, but were considered and repelled in the judgment under review. It was also expressed that while dispensing justice, it is the duty of the court to resolve the issue of law properly brought before it and once it is done, the finality is reached and then a review cannot be made on any grounds whatsoever. It is because of the fact that an opinion pronounced by this Division which stands at the apex of the judicial hierarchy should be given finality and any departure from that opinion will be justified only when circumstances of a substantial and compelling character make it necessary to do so. A finality of the judgment will not be reopened except where a glaring omission or patent mistake or grave error apparent on the face of the record has crept in by judicial fallibility.<br/><br/>Thus, the powers of review can be exercised sparingly within the limits of the statute. In the realm of law the courts and even the statues lean strongly in favour of finality of decisions legally and properly made. If the cases are reopened on flimsy grounds which have already been addressed by the courts then there will be no end to the litigation. That is why, the power of review is restricted by given guidelines of the apex courts of the sub-continent. The above views have been expressed in the cases of Major Bazlul Huda Vs. State, 63 DLR (AD) 62, Messrs Thungabhandra Industries Limited V. The Government of Andhra Pradesh, AIR 1964 SC 1372, Sheonandan Paswan V. State of Bihar, AIR 1983 SC 1125, Secretary, Ministry of Finance V. Md. Masdar Hossain, 21 BLD (AD) 126, Earshed Ali Shikder V. State, 56 DLR(AD)87, Ekushey Television Ltd. Vs.

We find no error of law in the judgment that call for review of the same.<br/><br/>The power of the President to commute any sentence though is not subject to any constitutional or judicial restraints. It is intended to afford relief from undue harshness arising out of evident mistake. This is an executive power. The proceedings for commutation of sentence by the President being an executive character, a condemned prisoner has no right to insist on an oral hearing. The manner of consideration of such petition lies within the discretion of the President. Death row convicts are afforded such privilege of filing of a mercy petition as a last resort on humanitarian consideration, but it cannot be equated with a right of appeal which is a statutory right. The President may or may not commute the sentence but in respect of an appeal, the appellate court can set aside the conviction on a reappraisal of the evidence afresh. It is in rarest of the rare cases a mercy petition or a review petition is allowed.<br/><br/>A right is a protection that cannot be taken away, but a privilege is different. They generally are limited in scope, and can sometimes be overborne or waived by other considerations. Rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory. Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics, especially theories of justice and deontology. There are different categories of rights, of them, we are concerned with legal rights, which are based on a society’s customs, laws, statutes or actions by legislature. Legal rights are sometimes called civil rights or statutory rights and are culturally and politically relative since they depend on a specific societal context to have meaning. On the other hand, a privilege is a special entitlement to immunity granted by the State or another authority to a restricted group, either by birth or on a conditional basis. It can be revoked in certain circumstances. In modern democratic states, a privilege is conditional and granted only after birth. By contrast, a right is an inherent, irrevocable entitlement held by all citizens or all human beings from the moment of birth.<br/><br/>While arguing about the applicability of Jail Code in respect of a convict under the provisions of Act, 1973, a subtle point was raised at the Bar as to whether Bengal Jail Code has any force of law. This is totally based on a wrong notion and this Code is very much holds the field until a new legislation is promulgated under the changed circumstances. This Code has all trappings of law and it is being followed by the jail authorities. The expression “Code” means a collection or system of laws. It comes from Roman Law; the collection of laws and constitutions made by order of Emperor Justinian is distinguished by application of ‘The Code’ by way of eminence; (Jowitt, “The Dictionary of English Law, 1959, Vol.I, page-399”). But etymologically it is derived from Latin Codex, the stock or stem of tree-originally it meant the board covered with Wax on which the ancients originally wrote. It is usually used for the body of laws established by the legislative authority of the State and designated to regulate completely, so far as a statute may, the subject to which it relates. It is, therefore, a law-there is no dispute about it, for example; the Code of Criminal Procedure; the Code of Civil Procedure; the Penal Code etc.<br/><br/>It is stated that the following Acts and Regulations regulate the establishment and management of jails, the confinement and treatment of persons therein, and the maintenance of discipline amongst them; (a) The Prisons Act, No.IX of 1894, as amended, (b) The Prisoners Act No.V of 1871 as amended (section 15), (c) The Prisoners Act, No.III of 1900, as amended, (d) Regulation No.III of 1818 (Bengal Code) for the confinement of State prisoners, (e) Act XXIV of 1855, an Act to substitute penal servitude for the punishment of transportation in respect of European and American convicts, and to amend the law relating to the removal of such convicts; (f) Act VIII of 1897, the Reformatory School Act, as amended; ((g) Act IV of 1912, the Lunacy Act, as amended; (h)Act IV of 1909, the Whipping Act, as amended; (i) Bengal Act, No.II of 1922, the Bengal Children’s Act, as amended; (j) Act XXV of 1934, the Factories Act, as amended etc. are compiled in it.<br/><br/>In the preamble it is provided that the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code (Act V of 1908), the Code of Criminal Procedure (Act V of 1898) as amended and the Penal Code (Act XLV of 1860) as amended, which relate to the confinement of prisoners, the execution of sentences, appeals, lunatics, and the like, must also be compiled with in connection with prison administration. Though in the Act of 1973, the provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure and the Evidence Act are made inapplicable by section 23, it is totally silent about the inapplicability the Bengal Jail Code. This Bengal Jail Code being a compilation of previous laws for the superintendence and management of jails is the only piece of rules on the subject prevailing and is being followed by jails throughout the country.<br/><br/>The prisoners either under trial or convicted are dealt with in accordance with these Rules. There is no doubt that it is practically an obsolete Rules but in the absence of anything to govern the practices of the jails, it is no doubt applicable to jails subject to certain limitations. The provisions of the Penal Code which are not inconsistent with the provisions of Act of 1973, are applicable to the proceedings of the Tribunal. What is more, the Act of 1973 and the Rules made thereunder provide for the jurisdiction of the Tribunals; the liability for the crimes; the constitution of the Tribunals; the appointment of the prosecutors and the investigation officers; the commencement of the proceedings; the procedure of trial; the powers of Tribunals; the provision for defence of an accused person; the restriction on adjournments; the mode of use of statements or confessions of accused persons; the procedure for pardon of an approver; the framing of charge; the right of accused person during trial; the protection of the witnesses; the rules of evidence; the judgment and sentence; the right of appeal, the powers of the Tribunals to frame Rules and the execution of sentence etc. But it is totally silent about the management, confinement and treatment of prisoners. In absence of any provisions in the Act of 1973 and the Rules framed thereunder in respect of the confinement and treatment of both under trial and convicted prisoners. After the conviction and sentence, a warrant of sentence is issued and a copy is communicated to jail authority. Naturally the jail authority will arrange his confinement in jail in accordance with the Jail Code. Thus there is no doubt that the provisions of the Jail Code will hold the field subject to certain limitations. It is provided that the provisions of the Act of 1973 shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other laws for the time being in force. The Rules framed thereunder are merely the detailed provisions to carry out the purposes of the Act. As there is no provision in the Act dealing with the under trial and convicted prisoners. Therefore, the provisions of the Act and the Rules are supplementary to the Jail Code. The question of inconsistency does not arise at all since the Act does not provide any provisions to regulate the maintenance and confinement of a prisoner after arrest or conviction.<br/><br/>On the question of sentence the learned counsel raised two points. Firstly, it is contended that natural justice equity and ends of justice demands that the sentence should be commuted to life since the sentence of death has been awarded relying upon a single witness. This submission is devoid of substance. In respect of charge No.6, it is true that there is one eye witness but, there are strong circumstantial evidence to corroborate the evidence of P.W.3. It was found that this witness is trustworthy, natural and wholly reliable one and that there were strong circumstantial evidence to corroborate her testimony. Considering the brutality of the incidents we awarded the sentence of death, which according to us, was proportionate to the gravity of the crimes. It was contended that the sentence was harsh. What is fair play, moral, humane or inoffensive or harsh to the conscience in one country is not necessarily so in another values, standards, and principles. They vary from place to place and from time to time. The penalty of cutting off hands and feet for theft has been abolished as contrary to humanity by Europian community and our country. The philosophy behind it is that it is a violation of the principles of natural justice or human rights. On the other hand, the death penalty for murder and other heinous crimes have been retained by Asian and Africa countries including Bangladesh and some states in the United States. According to our standards, the cutting off of hands and feet is an inhuman punishment while breaking of the neck is not.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that murder is a worse crime than theft and no argument is advanced for or against the retention of the death penalty. The point is not, however, whether the punishment is permissible as being in accordance with the standards of humanity, and the problem is thus to decide what is human punishment and what is not. Our law says hanging is humane but the European countries, which have abolished death penalty, might say that it is not. It is thus evident that all standards are relative, and that in deciding what punishment is contrary to humanity, the standards of Bangladeshi Law and of Bangladesh Constitution are to be applied. The conclusion that can be arrived at is that natural justice, equity and good conscience, morality and humanity in the contexts referred above must mean Bangladeshi as to what those virtues comprise as interpreted by our laws; and not some absolute platonic ‘Form’, that is superhuman, eternal and international.<br/><br/>Secondly, it is contended that this Division committed error of law in imposing death sentence to the petitioner without any finding that the sentence awarded by the Tribunal was “manifestly inadequate” and “unduly lenient”. In this connection, learned counsel has referred to two cases, Ram Narain V. State of UP, 1970(3) SCC 493 and Madho Ram V. State of UP, AIR 1973 SC 467.<br/><br/>In Ram Narain, eight accused persons forming an unlawful assembly with the common object of killing the deceased Bitta committed the murder. The trial court sentenced them to imprisonment for life. Complainant took a revision petition for enhancement of the sentence in respect of three accused persons who were assailants according to him and the appellants before the Supreme Court. The High Court allowed the revision and enhanced the sentence to one of death. The High Court observed that the murder was cold blooded and a premeditated one and that three appellants inflicted fatal injuries to Bitta and deserved the extreme penalty of death. In the context of the matter, the Supreme Court held that in the case of murder, the discretion is limited to two alternatives for the sentence that could be either death or imprisonment for life. The proper exercise of discretion is to be exercised on a proper consideration of all the relevant facts and circumstances keeping in view of the broad objective of sentence being neither too severe nor lenient. “<em>It is only when the sentence appears on the facts and circumstances of the case to be so manifestly inadequate as to have resulted in failure of justice that enhancement of sentence may be justified by the appellate court</em>”. The court observed. Under the existing law in cases of murder “<em>it is necessary for the court to give reasons for not imposing the extreme penalty of death and the discretion of the court in awarding the lesser penalty is, therefore, wider than before the amendment of the law in this respect</em>”. The Supreme Court interfered with the sentence mainly on the reasonings that the exercise of discretion by the High Court could not be described to be contrary to the recognized principle, and the State did not consider that the ends of justice required enhancement of the sentence but, the High Court interfered with at the instance of the informant.<br/><br/>In the latter case, similar views have been expressed. It was observed “it is no doubt true that the question of a sentence is a matter of discretion and when that discretion has been properly exercised along accepted judicial lines, an appellate court should not interfere to the detriment of an accused person except for very strong reasons which must be disclosed on the face of the judgment. If a substantial punishment has been given for the offence of which a person is guilty, after taking due regard to all relevant circumstances normally there should  be no interference by an appellate court. On the other hand, interference will be justified when the sentence is manifestly inadequate or unduly lenient in the particular circumstances of the case”. In that case it was found that the appellant suddenly without any warning attacked the deceased who was unarmed. From the nature of the injury described in the post mortem report, it was observed that the blow must have been inflicted by the accused with considerable force. The trial court sentenced the accused to imprisonment for life. The High Court did not agree with the lesser sentence in the circumstances of the case and was of the view that the sentence imposed by the trial court was ‘unduly lenient’ and ‘manifestly inadequate’ and enhanced the sentence to one of death. The Supreme Court affirmed the sentence of death.<br/><br/>The statement of law argued in those cases are not applicable since the law in India has been amended on the question of awarding a sentence of death to a person. Section 354(3) of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure provides ‘in the case of sentence of death, special reasons for such sentence’ should be given. Whereas, in our corresponding provision the language used in section 367(5) is quite distinct which provides, <em>“If the accused is convicted of an offence punishable with death or, in the alternative, with imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of years, the court shall in its, judgment state the reasons for the sentence awarded”</em>. The language used in sub-section (2) of section 20 of the Act is in <em>pari-materia </em>with section 367(5) of the Code. It is not stated that in case of awarding sentence of death special reasons should be assigned by the court. Under the sentencing principles of India, the imposition of lesser sentence is the rule and the imposition of the maximum sentence is an exception and therefore, while awarding the maximum sentence the court is required to assign special reasons. In those cases the trial courts on proper assessment of evidence was of the view that they were fit cases for awarding a sentence of imprisonment for life, which was the rule. In exceptional cases only a death sentence may be awarded on assigning special reasons. Even then the Supreme Court maintained the death sentence in the later case. In respect of the Act of 1973, the language is couched in the similar manner which states ‘<em>(2) upon conviction of an accused person, the Tribunal shall award sentence of death or such other punishment proportionate to the gravity of the crime as appears to the Tribunal to be just and proper’</em>.<br/><br/>The language is so clear that in convicting the accused person death sentence is the proper one, and if the Tribunal feels that a lesser sentence is to be awarded, it shall assign reasons therefore and in such case, it shall consider the gravity of the crime and the culpability of such accused person. The Tribunal has totally ignored the above principles and the position of law and imposed the lesser sentence on assigning a reason which does not carry the true intent of the sentencing principle. The principles of sentencing procedure, are uniform in our country and the court while awarding a sentence shall consider (a) the nature of the offence, (b) the culpability of the offender, (c) the circumstances of its commission, (d) the age and character of the offender, (e) the injury to individuals or to society, (f) effect of the punishment on the offender, amongst many other factors which would ordinarily be taken in mind.<br/><br/>Considering the nature of the offence and culpability of the petitioner in respect of charge No.6, this Division observed that while deciding just and appropriate sentence to be awarded for any of the offences to any accused person, the aggravating and mitigating factors and circumstances in which the crimes have been committed are to be balanced in a proportionate manner. The petitioner, it was observed, has committed worst and barbarous types of Crimes against Humanity. He took active role in the killing of almost the entire family except one, and participated in the incident of rape of innocent victims. His acts are comparable to none. Entire world raised voice against the barbaric Crimes against Humanity perpetrated in Bangladesh. Justice demands that it should impose a sentence befitting to the perpetration of the crime so that it reflects public abhorrence of crime. Cases of murders in a cold and calculated manner without provocation cannot but shock the conscience of the society which must abhor such heinous crime committed on helpless innocent persons. More so, the accused expressed no repentance for his conduct at any stage. His direct participation in the incident was cruel and brutal. Considering the nature of the offence, this Division by majority was of the view that the sentence of death was just and proper proportionate to the gravity of the crime.<br/><br/>It was further observed that while considering the punishment to be given to an accused person, the court should be alive not only to the right of the perpetrator, but also rights of the victims of the crime and the society’s reasonable expectation from the court for the proportionate deterrent punishment conforming to the gravity of the offence and consistent with the public abhorrence for the heinous crime committed by the accused person. This Division observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“We noticed the atmosphere that was prevalent during the recording of the evidence of P.W.3 from the note sheet of the tribunal. She was narrating the events of brutal killing of her mother and siblings; two of them were so much ravished that they fell into the jaws of death and the other-a child of two years was dashed to death. She was lamenting at the time of deposing as evident from the remarks noted by the tribunal like a baby, and then lost her sense. A pathetic heart-breaking atmosphere seized the proceedings of the tribunal. If one reads her testimony it will be difficult to control emotion. The murders were extremely brutal, cold blooded, diabolical, revolting so as to arouse intense and extreme indignation of the community. It was perpetrated with motive. On a close reading of the evidence of P.W.3 one can instantaneously arrive at a conclusion that there is something uncommon about the incidents of murder which render sentence of imprisonment for life inadequate and deserve for a death sentence.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“The term of Crimes against Humanity has come to mean anything atrocious committed on a large scale. These crimes are committed against civilian population during war; or persecution on political or racial or religious grounds in execution of any crime. These offences by nature are heinous. In the instant case, the appellant along with his cohorts attacked the house of Hazarat Ali Laskar, killed his wife, raped two minor daughters and then killed them with a minor son only because he supported the Awami League and was an admirer of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. These nafarious acts were perpetrated in a preplanned manner and in doing so, the appellant, who led the team exceeded all norms of humanity. He was involved in Islami Chhatra Sangh and Jamat-e-Islami politics from before the 1970 general election at Mirpur and accordingly, he had harboured grudge against Hazrat Ali Lasker. The aim of the perpetrators was to wipe out the family of Hazrat Ali Lasker, but incidentally P.W.3 survived. The horrible picture of the carnage that had been unleased was so brutal that the sentence of death is to be taken as the proper sentence. If no such sentence is passed in the facts of the case, it will be difficult to inflict a death sentence in other cases. The appellant participated in the incident in a planned and concerted manner with his cohorts and therefore, he cannot escape the maximum sentence for the offence he committed despite finding that the offences committed by the appellant are predominantly shocking the conscience of mankind.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“The appellant did not show any sort of repentance any point of time for his acts and deeds. The learned counsel for the appellant also did not pray for awarding the minimum sentence in case the Government’s appeal against the sentence is found maintainable. There is no cogent ground to take lenient view in awarding the sentence. Therefore, the sentence of imprisonment of life awarded to the appellant in respect of charge No.6 is based on total non application of mind and contrary to the sentencing principle. Awarding of a proper sentence in the facts of a given case is to assist in promoting the equitable administration of the criminal justice. Punishment is designed to protect society by deterring potential offenders. P.W.3 is a natural witness and it is only possible eyewitness in the circumstances of the case who cannot be said to be interested. In such incident, death sentence is the only proper sentence.</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">‘While awarding the sentence of imprisonment for life, the tribunal was of the view that the ‘sentences must reflect the predominant standard of proportionality between the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender’. This finding is inconsistent and not inconformity with law. If the gravity of the offence is taken as the basis for awarding sentence to the appellant, it is one of the fittest case to award the appellant the highest sentence in respect of the charge no.6 in which the killing and rape were brutal, cold blooded, diabolical and barbarous. If the tribunal does not award the maximum sentence considering the gravity of the charge, it will be difficult to find any other fit case to award such sentence’.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It is feebly contended by Mr. Razzaq that the sentence of death having been awarded by this Division, the warrant of execution of the sentence ought to have been issued and served by this Division, and in this case since the warrant having been issued by the Tribunal in violation of law, the sentence cannot be legally executed. In this connection he has drawn our attention to rule 979 of the Jail Code. The execution of the sentence should be postponed till a fresh warrant is communicated by an officer of this Division, it is finally contended.<br/><br/>Rule 979 provides that when a prisoner is sentenced to death, the police officer who attends the trial shall at once inform the Superintendent of Jail in writing of the sentence that has been passed by the court, and, if the sentence is passed by the Sessions Judge, that officer will issue a warrant of commitment pending confirmation of sentence by the High Court Division. When the sentence has been confirmed by the High Court Division or passed by it a warrant for execution of the sentence will be transmitted by the Sessions Judge or an officer of the High Court Division, as the case may be, to the Superintendent of Jail in which the person for sentence is confined. So this provision shows that in both the cases, where the sentence has been confirmed by the High Court Division or the sentence has been given by it, the warrant of execution shall be transmitted by the Sessions Judge or an officer of the High Court Division, as the case may be. In this case, this Division passed the death sentence and after the judgment, the Tribunal communicated the said sentence. There is no provision in this rule that if the communication of the sentence is made by an inferior Tribunal, it will be illegal or void. This is merely an irregularity and this will not be said to be ineffective. The legislature has used the expression ‘will be’ in respect of communication of the sentence. So, if the inferior Tribunal communicates the warrant as per direction of this Division, it cannot be said that the warrant was inoperative. This is a mere technical formality.<br/><br/>From the above conspectus we sum up our opinion as under. The review petitions are maintainable. A review petition should not be equated with an appeal. In criminal matters, the power of review must be limited to an error which have a material, real ground on the face of the case. The finality attached to a judgment at the apex level of the judicial hierarchy upon a full fledged hearing of the parties should be re-examined in exceptional cases and a review is not permissible to embark upon a reiteration of the same points. The period of limitation provided in the Appellate Division rules will not be applicable in respect of a review petition from a judgment on appeal under the Act of 1973. The period of limitation is fifteen days and the review petition should be disposed of on priority basis. If a warrant of death for execution is communicated to the Jail authority after it is confirmed or imposed by this Division, the condemned prisoner should be afforded an opportunity to file a mercy petition and he should also be afforded an opportunity to meet his near ones before the execution of  the sentence. If the jail authority fixes a date for execution of the sentence, the same cannot be taken as has been done hurriedly. If any review or mercy petition is filed or pending, the sentence cannot be executed unless the petitions are disposed of. So, the period of seven days or twenty one days mentioned in sub-rules (I) and (VI) of rule 991 of the Jail Code have no force of law under the changed conditions.<br/><br/>For the reason stated above, we find no merit in these review petitions. The petitions are accordingly dismissed on merit.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Nazrul Islam Talukder, J:</u></strong><br/> <br/>This criminal appeal, at the instance of the convict-appellant, is directed against the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 04.09.2003 passed by the learned Assistant Sessions Judge, 2nd Court, Comilla  in Sessions Case No. 80 of 2001 convicting the convict- appellant under sections  342/392 of the  Penal Code and sentencing him thereunder to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 (ten) years and to pay a fine of Tk. 5,000/=, in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 01 (one) year more and/or pass such other or further order or orders as to this Court may seem fit and proper.<br/><br/>The prosecution case as disclosed by P.W.1 may be, briefly, stated as follows: On 03.2.2000, P.W.1, namely, Saidul Alam as an informant lodged a First Information Report with Kotwali Police Station against the convict-appellant and another stating, inter-alia, that there was a litigation between the parties over a land dispute. On the date of occurrence, P.W.1 along with P.W.2, namely, Ali Azam went to the Court at Comilla in order to know about the latest position of their civil suit.  After taking information of their case, they were coming home. While they reached Shasangacha bus stand, the convict -appellant along with other miscreants being armed with Pistol, Chapati and dagger attacked them, dragged them to the north side of the Bus-stand at Shasangacha and assaulted them with fist blows. The convict-appellant snatched away Tk.7,000/- from the pocket of P.W.2 and F.I.R named accused No. 1 snatched away a wrist watch from the left hand of  P.W.2. The F.I.R named accused, in collaboration with some unknown accused, took signatures of P.W.1 and P.W.2 on three stamps of Tk.50/- each at gun point. Thereafter, the convict-appellant and another took them to a residential hotel, namely, ‘People’s hotel’ and confined them there. On getting information, the police after lodging G.D No. 1835 dated 31.01.2000, went to the hotel, recovered the informant and another and arrested the F.I.R named accused No.1, namely, Yunus Miah. Hence, a First Information Report was lodged against the convict-appellant and another under sections 143/372/323/379/387/34 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>During investigation, the police went to the place of occurrence and recorded the statements of the witnesses under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Having found a <em>prima facie</em> case, the police submitted charge sheet being No.108 dated 03.2.2000 against the convict-appellant and another under sections 342/323/379/387/34 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>At the time of commencement of the trial, the learned Assistant Sessions Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Khulna framed charge against the convict-appellant and another under sections 342/392/387 of the Penal Code and the same was read over and explained to the convict-appellant who denied the charge and claimed to be innocent and prayed to face trial in accordance with law.<br/><br/>However, the charge could not be read over to the co-accused, Yunus Miah as he was in abscondence from the proceeding at that time. <br/><br/>It is on record that during the trial of the case, the convict-appellant was enlarged on bail by the learned Judge of the Tribunal, but he absconded by misusing the privilege of bail.<br/><br/>At the trial of the case, the prosecution examined as many as 6 witnesses to prove the prosecution case. On the other hand, the defence did not examine any witness in support of the defence case.<br/><br/>It is to be mentioned here that the co-accused, Yunus Miah died during the trial of the case and the convict-appellant could not be examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as he was in abscondence after being enlarged on bail.  However, the learned Judge of the Trial Court after recording of evidence of the prosecution witnesses and hearing the parties found the prosecution case proved against the convict-appellant and convicted him under sections 342/392 of the Penal Code and sentenced him thereunder to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 (ten) years and to pay a fine of Tk. 5,000/=, in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 01 (one) year more.<br/><br/>Though the convict-appellant remained absconder, he was, subsequently, arrested by the police on 13.12.2008, that is, after delivery of judgment. The convict-appellant, thereafter, applied for certified copy of the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence and after procuring the same, he preferred this criminal appeal before this Court under section 408(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. <br/><br/>At the very outset, Mr. Md. Harunur Rashid, learned Advocate appearing for the convict-appellant, submits that though the alleged occurrence took place on 30.1.2000, the First Information Report was lodged with the concerned police station on 03.2.2000, that is, after making a delay of 3 days and that the explanation given in the First Information Report does not appear to be satisfactory and as such, the same casts doubt on the veracity of the prosecution case. He next submits that the charge was not framed in terms of the prosecution case and that the story mentioned in the charge is a total departure from the prosecution story and as such, the impugned judgment and order passed against the convict-appellant is liable to be set aside. He then submits that the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses is highly contradictory and that the impugned judgment and order passed on the basis of evidence of interested witnesses cannot be sustainable in the eye of law. He also submits that though the prosecution examined as many as 6 witnesses, the evidence adduced by P.W.1 was not supported by P.W.2 and the other witnesses and as such, the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence is untenable on the basis of evidence having not been corroborated by the evidence of independent witnesses and as such, the impugned judgment and order is liable to be set aside. He emphatically submits that the important witnesses from the place of bus stand as well as from the place of People’s hotel were not examined in the instant case to prove the prosecution case and had they been examined, they would not have supported the prosecution case and as such, the convict-appellant is entitled to get the benefit of doubt under section 114(g) of the Evidence Act. He lastly submits that under the circumstances, this Criminal appeal should be allowed and the conviction and sentence should be set aside.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Mr. Monjur Kader, learned Assistant Attorney-General appearing on behalf of the State-Respondent, submits that the prosecution examined as many as 6 witnesses to prove the prosecution case and that all the prosecution witnesses adduced evidence disclosing the convict-appellant’s involvement in the commission of the offence and as such, the learned Judge of the Trial Court rightly passed the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence. He next submits that all the prosecution witnesses are neutral and disinterested witnesses and as such, the impugned judgment and order based on the evidence of the prosecution witnesses is very much sustainable in the eye of law and as such, the criminal appeal filed by the convict-appellant should be dismissed.<br/><br/>We have gone through the petition of appeal, evidence of witnesses and other materials on record. We have also considered the submissions made by the learned Advocates for both the parties.<br/><br/>It is a settled principle of law that the prosecution has to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubt by adducing reliable and satisfactory evidence before the Court to connect the convict-appellant with the alleged offence.<br/><br/>Now we want to see and examine whether the prosecution has been able to prove its case against the convict-appellant by adducing reliable and satisfactory evidence before the Court.<br/><br/>In the instant case, the prosecution examined as many as 6 witnesses. P.W.1, Md. Saidul Alam is an informant who deposed before the Trial Court to the effect that on the date of occurrence, he along with P.W.2 went to the court at Comilla in order to know the latest position of their civil suit. He next testified that while they reached Shasangacha bus stand, they were attacked by the accused and others who snatched away Tk.7,000/- and a wrist watch from  the possession of P.W.2. He then claimed that the accused took them to a nearby ‘People’s hotel’ forcibly and took their signatures on three stamps of Tk. 50/- each at gun point. He also stated that after getting information, the police came to the hotel, recovered him along with P.W.2, arrested the co-accused, Yunus Miah and lodged a First Information Report against the convict-appellant and another. It appears that P.W.1 was not cross- examined by the convict-appellant as he being enlarged on bail remained an absconder at the time of recording of evidence of P.W.1.<br/><br/>P.W.2, Ali Azzam is a star prosecution witness who deposed before the Trial Court stating, inter alia, that on the date of occurrence, while the P.W.2 and P.W.1 were coming home from Comilla, the F.I.R. named accused and others forcibly took them to the north side of the bus stand.  He then stated that the convict-appellant snatched away Tk.7,000/- and F.I.R. named accused No.1 took away a wrist watch. He next testified before the Court that subsequently, the accused took them to a nearby ‘People’s hotel’’ and compelled them to put their signatures on three stamps of Tk. 50/- each. He then stated that after getting information, the police came to the place of occurrence and arrested the First Information Report named accused No.1. This witness was also not cross-examined by the convict-appellant who remained an absconder during trial of the case.<br/><br/>P.W.3, Md. Abdul Hamid, ASI of police stated in his deposition before the Trial Court that he had submitted report as to the nature and character of the convict-appellant. Basically, the P.W.3 is not the witness of the place of occurrence; rather he is a formal witness only.<br/><br/>P.W.4, Mobarak Hossain claimed in his deposition before the Trial Court that on the date of occurrence, while P.W.1 and P.W.2 were on their way home, the F.I.R named accused and some miscreants took them to the north side of the bus stand and assaulted them there. He next testified that the accused also took them to the ‘People’s hotel’, took Tk. 7,000/- and forcibly took their signatures on stamp papers. He further claimed that after getting information, the police came to the hotel, recovered them and arrested F.I.R. named accused No.1, Yunus Miah.<br/><br/>P.W.5, Ataur Rahman claimed in his evidence that on the date of occurrence, some miscreants assaulted the P.W.1 and P.W.2 and snatched away Tk.7,000/- along with a wrist watch from their possession. He next claimed that subsequently, the miscreants took them to the ‘People’s hotel’ forcibly and took their signatures on stamp papers. He then testified that after getting information, the police came to the place of occurrence, arrested the accused, Yunus Miah and took him to the police station. <br/><br/>P.W.6, Md. Siraj Uddin is an Investi-gating Officer as well as a formal witness. He deposed that he went to the place of occurrence, recorded the statements of the witnesses under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and submitted charge sheet against the convict-appellant and others under sections 342/323/379/387/34 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>It appears from the record of the case that though the prosecution examined as many as 6 witnesses, none of them was cross-examined by the convict-appellant since he remained an absconder during the trial of the case.<br/><br/>On the basis of evidence given by the prosecution witnesses, let us see whether the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence is based on legal evidence or not.<br/><br/>On perusal of the testimony of P.W.1, it appears to us that P.W.1, Md. Saidul Alam is an informant who lodged the First Information Report with the local police station against the convict-appellant and another disclosing, inter alia, that while they were coming home from Comilla, they were attacked by the accused and others who took them to the northern side of Shasangacha bus stand and snatched away Tk.7,000/- and a wrist watch from witness No.2. It further appears that the accused, subsequently, took them to ‘People’s hotel’ and took their signatures on the three stamps of Tk. 50/- each at gun point.<br/><br/>It is alleged by P.W.1 as informant in the First Information Report that the convict-appellant and others dragged the P.W.1 and P.W.2 to the north side of the bus stand and compelled them to put their signature on the three stamps of TK.50/- each. But P.W.1 clearly deposed before the court that the accused and others took them to  ‘People’s hotel’ and forced them to put their signatures on some stamp papers.<br/> <br/>On a close scrutiny of evidence of P.W.1, it stems out that the P.W.1, in his evidence, did not specifically disclose the name of any accused who actually snatched away Tk. 7,000/- and a wrist watch from the possession of P.W.2. A reference to the evidence given by P.W.1 clearly and manifestly shows that there are some material contradictions and discrepancies between the statements made in the First Information Report and the evidence given by P.W.1 before the court. It may be mentioned here that the First Information Report is not a substantive piece of evidence, but it can be used to corroborate the statement of the informant under section 157 of the Evidence Act or to contradict him under section 145 of the said Act. The Court is, of course, entitled to note the conflicts between the first recorded version of the prosecution case and the case made out in the course of the trial. In this regard, reliance may be made on the decision in the case of <strong>The State -Vs- Basirullah, 16 DLR(1964) 189, </strong>wherein it has been observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“The Court is entitled to note the conflict between the first recorded version of the prosecution case and the story that is made out in course of trial. A comparison between two such versions of the case is not only permissible, but imperative in the context of the circumstances set out above.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In view of foregoing discussions and the propositions of law discussed above, we hold that the evidence given by P.W.1, as we see it, suffers from contradictions and infirmities and the same casts doubt on the veracity of the prosecution version.<br/><br/>The evidence of P.W.2 indicates that the F.I.R. named accused and others dragged them to the north side of bus stand and the convict-appellant snatched away Tk. 7000/- and F.I.R. named accused No.1 took away a wrist watch. But he did not particularly mention the name of the person from whom the alleged money and the wrist watch were taken away.<br/><br/>He also did not specifically disclose the name of any accused who took them to the nearby ‘People’s hotel’ and compelled them to put their signatures on three stamps of Tk. 50/- each.<br/><br/>On going through the evidence of P.W.1 and P.W.2, we find that P.W.1 did not disclose name of any accused who allegedly snatched the away money and the wrist watch from P.W.2; but P.W.2 disclosed the name of convict-appellant and entangled him with commission of alleged offence. However, none of the witnesses could not mention the name of any accused who compelled P.W.1 and P.W.2 to put their signatures on three stamp-papers.<br/><br/>It is evident from the First Information Report that there is enmity between the parties over a land property. It is a settled principle of law that when enmity is admitted between the parties, the court has to insist on corroboration of the prosecution case by independent evidence. Under the circumstances, it is, of course, correct to say that the evidence of P.W.1 has not been supported and corroborated by the evidence given by P.W.2.<br/><br/>P.W.3 is Md. Abdul Hamid, ASI of police. He is not the witness of place of occurrence. He only submitted report regarding the nature and character of the convict-appellant and others. Accordingly, P.W.3 is a formal witness who did not disclose anything about the involvement of the convict-appellant in the commission of offence.<br/><br/>From the evidence adduced by P.W.4, it appears that P.W.4 did not specifically mention the name of any accused who snatched away Tk. 7000/- and compelled them to put their signatures on stamp-papers.<br/>P.W. 5 also gave evidence in line with the evidence given by P.W.1, 2 and 4 and he did not specifically disclose the name of any accused who took money from P.W.2 and compelled the informant and others to put their signatures on three stamp-papers.<br/><br/>P.W.6 is an Investigating Officer, who mainly submitted charge sheet under sections 342/323/379/387/34 of the Penal Code against the convict-appellant and others.<br/><br/>The well known legal dictum of law is that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses is to be weighed but not to be counted. The evidence of witnesses depends upon his knowledge of facts to which he testified. On the credibility of witnesses, we may refer to a decision in the case of <strong>Dalim and another Vs.The State, 15 BLD (HCD) (1995) 133,</strong> wherein it has been settled :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“The credit to be given to the evidence of a witness is a matter which is not governed by rule of law. It depends upon his knowledge of facts to which he testified, his disinterestedness, integrity and veracity. In judging the credibility of a witness the Court has to consider the surrounding circumstances as well as the broad probabilities. When a witness is found to be trustworthy, straight-forward and reliable and his evidence intrinsically rings true, the evidence of such a witness can be safely relied upon.”       </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It is a settled principle of law that prosecution is to prove its case by adducing reliable and satisfactory evidence before the Court and the accused remains innocent till the prosecution proves guilt against him. In this connection, we may refer to a decision in the case of Shamsul Huq @ Shamsul and others Vs.The State, 38 DLR (AD) (1986) 75, wherein it has been decided :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“The manner of the incident as alleged by the prosecution must be proved by the prosecution alone; that burden never shifts. If the manner of the incident is not proved, the prosecution must fail no matter the defence version of the case has been proved either.” </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Similar view finds support in a decision in the case of Md. Musa alias Musaiya alias Shafir Bap Vs.The State, 15 BLD (HCD) (1995) 169, wherein, it has been held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“The prosecution must prove its case beyond all reasonable doubt by reliable and sufficient evidence and the onus of proof of the case is always on the prosecution and further even some other cases are pending against the appellant, for that he or they cannot be found guilty in this case unless this case is proved beyond all reasonable doubt by sufficient evidence.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The submission advanced by the learned Advocate for the convict-appellant is that the evidence given by prosecution witnesses is contradictory and untrustworthy in nature and as such, the conviction and sentence awarded on the basis of such contradictory and untrustworthy evidence cannot be sustained in the eye of law.<br/> <br/>Before coming to a decision, we should discuss the rule of prudence governing the case on contradictory and discrepant evidence.<br/> <br/>In order to understand the scope of law on the aforesaid matters, we may refer to a decision in the case of Mayezuddin and other Vs.The State, 31 DLR (AD)(1979) 37, wherein it has been spelt out :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“The discrepant statement is one which is either irrelevant or incoherent, but it is not irreconcilable. A discrepant statement is not fatal to the credibility of a witness. A contradictory statement is one which is conflicting and is not reconcilable with other statements either of his own or any other witness. The question in such case is that it is open to a court of fact either to reject the whole evidence of a witness as untrustworthy or to reject the contradi-ctory part as unreliable or to rely upon that portion, which in the opinion of the court, fits in with other evidence and the facts and circumstances of the case. The exercise of the power is guided by judicial discretion and cannot be exercised either arbitrarily or capriciously.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>On a critical analysis of evidence given by the prosecution witnesses, we find that the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses is not mutually corroborative; rather the same appears to be contradictory, unreliable and untrustworthy. Accordingly, we cannot fasten the convict-appellant with the commission of alleged offences under sections 342/392 of the Penal Code on the basis of contradictory, inconsistent and unreliable evidence.<br/> <br/>In view of above discussions and propositions of law, we are led to hold that the learned judge of the trial court failed to appreciate the inherent contradictions and infirmities in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and that the conviction and sentence awarded on the basis of untrustworthy and unreliable evidence can not be maintained at all.  <br/> <br/>Apart from this, it is contended by the learned advocate for the convict-appellant that admittedly, there is enmity between the convict-appellant and the informant party. It is further contended that the alleged occurrence took place on 30.1.2000 and the police arrested the F.I.R named accused, namely, Yunus Miah on that day; but it is curious enough to note the First Information Report was lodged on 03.2.2000 making a delay of 3 days and that the explanation given to the effect that the delay was caused because of consultation with their relatives does not stand to reason. Since the prosecution could not give satisfactory explanation for making a delay of 3 days in lodging the First Information Report, it appears to us that the delay of 3 days in lodging the First Information Report on the face of enmity between the parties has made the whole prosecution case shaky and doubtful. The aforesaid legal view gets support in the decision in the case of Tajul Islam and others Vs.The State, 15 BLD(HCD)(1995) 53, wherein it has been laid down :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“The unreasonable delay in lodging the F.I.R. inevitably gives rise to suspicion which requires the court to look for possible motive and the explanation for delay and consider its effect on the trustworthiness or otherwise of the prosecution version of the case.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Another aspect of the prosecution case is that when P.W.1 and P.W.2 were coming home from the court at Comilla, they were taken to the north side of the Shasangacha bus stand and thereafter, they were taken to ‘People’s hotel’, but it is interesting to note that none of the witnesses from the bus stand as well as from the hotel was examined to prove the prosecution case. Under this scenario of the case, it may be noted that non-examination of important witnesses from the place of occurrence has rendered the whole prosecution case unbelievable. Under these circumstances, we may hold that had the witnesses been examined by the prosecution, they would have not supported the prosecution case and as such, the accused-appellant is entitled to get the benefit of doubt under section 114(g) of the Evidence Act. In this connection, reliance may be put on the decision in the case of Kawsarun Nessa and another Vs. The State, 15 BLD (HCD) (1995) 21 wherein it has been held :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“Non-examination of independent witnesses, especially some of the close neighbours, calls for a presumption under section 114(g) of the Evidence Act to the effect that had they been examined, they might have deposed against the prosecution.” </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It is alleged by the prosecution in the First Information Report that the F.I.R. named accused and others forcibly took P.W.1 and P.W.2 to the north side of Shasangacha bus stand at gun point; that the accused-appellant snatched away Tk. 7000/- from the P.W.2 and another accused, Yunus Miah took away a wrist watch from the possession of P.W.2; that the accused compelled them to put signature on three unwritten non-judicial stamp papers under intimidation; that then the convict-appellant went away from the bus stand taking snatched money and stamp-papers; that thereafter the accused, Yunus Miah with the help of other miscreants took them to ‘People’s hotel’ and confined them there, but it appears from the charge framing order that charge was framed against the convict-appellant and another to the effect that as soon as P.W.1 and P.W.2 reached Shasangacha bus stand, the convict-appellant and another snatched away Tk. 7,000/- along with a wrist watch from P.W.2, took his signature on stamp-papers and confined him in ‘People’s hotel’ and as such, the convict-appellant and others committed offences under sections 342/392/387 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>On going through the First Information Report and charge framing order, we find some contradictions between the charge framing order and the prosecution case and as such, it transpires that the story disclosed in the charge framing order is, no doubt, a departure from the prosecution case and accordingly, we find that the charge itself is a defective one which was not framed in the light of prosecution story as alleged in the First Information Report and as such, the conviction and sentence based on defective charge can not be sustained in the eye of law.<br/><br/>From the foregoing discussion and having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we are led to hold that the prosecution could not prove its case against the convict-appellant beyond all reasonable doubt by adducing reliable and satisfactory evidence before the court.<br/><br/>Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the evidence on record, we find substance in the submissions advanced by the learned Advocate for the convict-appellant, Mr. Harunur Rashid. Accordingly, we find merit in this criminal appeal.  <br/>   <br/>Consequently, the criminal appeal is allowed.<br/><br/>The impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 04.09.2003 passed by the learned Assistant Sessions Judge, 2nd Court, Comilla in Sessions Case No. 80 of 2001 is hereby set aside. The convict-appellant is acquitted of the charge levelled against him.<br/><br/>Let the convict-appellant be set at liberty at once, if not wanted in connection with any other case.<br/><br/>Let the lower Court’s record along with a copy of this judgment be sent down immediately.  <br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"> </div></div></div></div>

Abu Zafor Siddique, J:</u></strong><br/><br/>This appeal is directed against the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 28/03/2011 passed by the learned Judge of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Kushtia, in Nari-O-Shishu Case No.165 of 2009, arising out of Kushtia Police Station Case No.07 dated 10/11/2008 corresponding to G.R. Case No.394 of 2008, under section 7 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 convicting under the said section  and sentencing him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 14 years and to pay a fine of Tk.1,000/-, in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 2 months more.<br/><br/>The prosecution case, in short, is that on 10/11/2008 one Most. Nurunnahar, wife of Md. Monirul Islam being informant lodged a First Information Report (Shortly FIR) with the Kushtia Police Station alleging, inter alia, that her daughter Maushumi, was a student of class VI of Blance Beem of Bangladesh Gymnastic Federation group BKSP, she used to come to Badhunat Gymnasium at Bangobandhu Market, Kushtia, for physical exercise. On the date of occurrence i.e. on 02/11/2008 at about 8.00 A.M. while the victim started for gymnasium from the residence of her grand father at that time accused Rasel, Hiru, Hashem and others kidnapped her and she did not return home. In this regard the informant lodged general diary entry being No.83 dated 02/11/2008 with the Kushtia Police Station. Thereafter the informant and her relatives searched for the victim at every possible places but failed to recover. The accused Rasel made a call from his cell phone to the cell phone of informant’s brother and informed him that they kidnapped the victim Mowshumi and got her married. The accused-appellant Rasel also threatened him to accept their marriage otherwise he would go to India along with the victim, hence the case.<br/><br/>One Md. Abdul Khaleque Howlader, Sub-Inspector of Police, Kushtia Police Station, was appointed investigating officer of the case and as investigating officer of the case he visited the place of occurrence, made sketch map of the place of occurrence along with an index and recorded statements of the witnesses under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. All on a sudden the victim and accused Rasel surrendered before the court of Magistrate. The investigating officer made arrangement for medical examination of the victim and also made arrangement for recording statement under section 22 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000, and after investigation having found prima-facie case submitted charge-sheet under section 7, 9(1), 30 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 against the accused persons.<br/><br/>Thereafter the case record was transmitted to the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Kushtia for trial, and the same was renumbered as Nari-O-Shishu Case No.165 of 2009 and the learned Judge of the Tribunal, Kushtia took cognizance against the appellant and others. Accordingly, charge was framed against the convict-appellant and others under section 7, 9(1), 30 of the said Ain and the same was read over to the appellant and others who pleaded not guilty of the offence and claimed to be tried in accordance with law. <br/><br/>During trial the prosecution examined as many as 8 witnesses but the defence examined none.<br/><br/>From the trend of cross-examination of the P.Ws. the defence case is that the convict-appellant is an innocent person and he has been falsely implicated with this case as the victim girl willfully went with him out of love and she got married and the convict appellant neither kidnapped her on married by force.<br/><br/>After conclusion of the hearing the parties and on consideration of the evidence and the materials on record and in view of the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned Tribunal came to the finding that the prosecution proved the charge beyond all reasonable doubt and accordingly, the court below convicted the appellant and acquitted the other co-accuseds from the charge levelled against them.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid judgment and order of conviction and sentence the appellant preferred the instant appeal for setting aside the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed against him.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Shirajul Islam, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant submits that the learned Judge of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Kushtia has misread the evidence and misinterpreted the law, thus passed the judgment and order of conviction which is not tenable in the eye of law. He submits that the convict appellant Mehedi Hasan alias Rasel is an innocent person and he has been falsely implicated with the case rather Rasel had love affairs with the victim and out of such love the victim girl willfully went with Rasel and got married. He also submits that the appellant Rasel did not kidnap her and the learned Judge totally failed to consider the evidence adduced by the witnesses, as such, the order of conviction and sentence is liable to be set-aside.<br/><br/>On the other hand Mr. Md. Zahurul Islam, the learned Deputy Attorney General, appearing on behalf of the State submits that the prosecution by producing sufficient evidence has been able to prove case beyond all reasonable doubt, as such, there is nothing to be interfered by this court in this case, so, the appeal should be dismissed.<br/><br/>We have heard the submission of both sides and perused the impugned judgment and order of the learned Judge of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Kushtia and the L.C. Record. Let us now discuss the relevant evidence and other materials on record together with the attending facts and circumstances of this case in our own way to ascertain whether the Tribunal committed any illegality in passing the order of conviction and sentence.<br/><br/>P.W.-1, Nurrunnahar is the informant of the case and as well as the mother of the victim who supported the FIR version. She also proved the FIR as Exhibit-1 and her signature on it Exhibit 1/1. In her cross-examination, she denied all the suggestions given by the defence. But in cross-examination on re-call she stated that she got married twenty years back, victim has been given marriage on 16.12.2009, before marriage the victim divorced the accused person.<br/><br/>P.W.-2, Mowshumi Aktar is the victim of the case, she supported her statement recorded under section 22 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000, and she has identified her statement (Exhibit-2/1). In her cross-examination, she denied all the suggestions given by the defence. But in cross-examination on re-call, she admitted that she was married with Saddam Hossain on 16/12/09 and she also stated that she married accused Rasel on 02/11/08 and divorced him on 17/12/08 and she further deposed that in both the Kabin Namas her age was shown as 18 years.<br/><br/>P.W.-3, Osman in his examination in chief stated that victim Mowsumi is his niece who, on her way to physical exercise centre was kidnapped by the accused person and later on he heard that she was raped. In cross-examination, he stated that at the time of occurrence he was not at home however, he denied the suggestions by the defence.<br/><br/>P.W.- 4, Nur Mohammad is the father of the informant and also the grand father of the victim.  In his examination in chief he stated that he heard that the convict appellant Rasel married the victim. In his cross-examination, he stated that he did not see the occurrence, he was not examined by the police, it was not known to him whether the victim divorced Rassel, he denied the suggestions by the defence.<br/><br/>P.W.-5, Dr. Abdus Salam, Medical Officer and one of the member of the medical board, in his examination in chief stated that they have examined the victim Mowshumi Aktar on 26/01/09 and found that the hymen of the victim was old ruptured, external and internal injury were absent and they have found no sign of recent sexual intercourse on the person of the victim. The medical board also found that the victim is about 13 to 14 years old. He has identified the medical report (Exhibit-3) and his signature on it (Exhibit-3/1) and he also identified signature of the other members of the medical board on it (Exhibit-3/2 series). In cross-examination, he deposed that the victim did not disclosed anything about rape or sexual intercourse as well as there was no mark upon the body of the victim.<br/><br/>P.W.-6, Babu was tendered by the prosecution. On interrogation by court, he deposed that he was the publicity secretary of the policing committee. He stated that he talked over mobile phone with the victim and accused Rasel, they married each other and there was nothing as to rape or use of face. In his cross-examination by the court, he deposed that he handed over both the victim and the convict Rasel to the court because they stated that they would not be alive without each other. He was also not examined by the police.<br/><br/>P.W.-7, Rakon is the local witness. He stated in his examination in chief that he worked at Hasan Jewelers, Kushtia and  convict Rasel was worked nearby Reshmi Jewelers. The victim visited Rasel time to time as they had love affairs. He further stated that in the year 2008 the victim Mowshumi took away the accused Rasel and they got married. He also admitted that he signed in the Nikahnama as witness.<br/>P.W.-8, Md. Abdul Khalque, who is the investigating officer of the case in his examination in chief stated that he visited the place of occurrence, prepared sketch map of the place of occurrence along with index, recorded the statements of the witnesses under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and arranged for medical examination of the victim and also arranged for recording her statement under section 22 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000, and having found prima-facie case submitted charge sheet against the convict appellant and others co-accused under section 7, 9(1), 30 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000. He also Exhibited all documents. In his cross-examin-ation he stated that he got the Kabin Nama, affidavit of marriage between the convict Rasel and the victim Mowshumi during investigation. He denied other suggestions given by the defence.<br/><br/>These are all evidence adduced by the prosecution.<br/><br/>On perusal of the aforesaid evidence of the prosecution witnesses it appears that P.W.-1, Nurunnahar is the informant and mother of the victim. She has stated in her cross-examination on re-call, “২০ বৎসর পূর্বে আমার বিয়ে হয়। বিয়ের এক বৎসর পরে ভিকটিমের জন্ম হয়।” According to the aforesaid statement we find at the time of occurrence the victim was about 17 years old. P.W.-2 who is the victim stated in her cross-examination on re-call that-“০২/১১/২০০৮ খ্রিঃ তারিখে আসামীর সাথে আামার বিয়ে হয় এবং ১৭/১২/২০০৮ খ্রিঃ তারিখে আসামীকে তালাক প্রদান করি। উভয় কাবিন নামায় আমার বয়স ১৮ বৎসর উল্লেখ আছে।”। That the victim herself stated that her age was about 18 years. P.W.-3. Osman is brother of the informant and he had no knowledge about the occurrence. P.W.-4. Nur Mohammad the father of the informant deposed that- “আমি নিজে ঘটনা প্রত্যক্ষ করি নাই।” P.W.-5. Dr. Abdus Samad deposed that they did not find  recent sign of rape, P.W.-6. Babu is a very important and independent witness of the case, who was tendered by the prosecution but he deposed on interrogation by the court as follows; -“আমি পুলিশিং কমিটির প্রচার সম্পাদক। আসামী রাসেলের আম্মা লিখিত অভিযোগ দেয়। আমরা দুই পক্ষের সাথে আলাপ করি। মৌসুমী ও রাসেলের সাথে আমি মোবাইল ফোনে কথা বলি। তারা পরষ্পর বিয়ে করে। কোন অপহরনের ঘটনা ঘটে নাই।” In his cross-examination, he also stated,  “আমি আসামী ও ভিকটিমকে কোর্টে সোপার্দ করি। কারন হলো তারা বলে যে, তারা একে অপরকে ছাড়া বাঁচবেনা।” P.W.-7. Rakon is the worker of the Hasan Jewelers at Kushtia, who deposed as follows; “আমি হাসান জুয়েলার্সে স্বর্নের কাজ করি। আসামী রাসেল ঐ সময়ে পার্শ্ববর্তী রেশমী জুয়েলার্সে কাজ করিত। মৌসুমী মাঝে মাঝে ঐ দোকানে রাসেলের নিকট আসিত। তাদের মধ্যে ভালবাসা ছিল। ০৮ সালে মৌসুমী রাসেলকে ডেকে নিয়ে যায়। তাদের বিয়ে হয়। তাদের নিকাহ নাময় স্বাক্ষর করি।” P.W.-8. Md. Abdul Khaleque is the investig-ating officer of the case.<br/><br/>We have given our anxious consideration to the evidence adduced by the prosecution witnesses along with other materials. Though the prosecution claimed that the victim Mowshumi was kidnapped by the appellant but the prosecution witnesses did not support this contention of the prosecution rather all the disinterested witnesses have deposed otherwise. P.Ws.1, 2, 3 and 4 are the close relatives and they have supported the prosecution story but the disinterested witnesses like P.Ws.6 and 7 have falsifies the interested witnesses. These two witnesses have categorically stated that there is nothing as to kidnap rather the victim Mowshumi had a love affairs with the appellant and she eloped with him, latter they got married and lived as husband and wife.<br/><br/>P.W.6-Babu categorically stated as follows; “ আমি আসামী ও ভিকটিম কে কোর্টে সোপর্দ করি। কারন হলো তারা বলে যে, তারা একে অপরকে ছাড়া বাঁচবে না।” From the above statement of the P.W. it appears that there was a deep love in between the convict and victim and out of that love they married each other but the mother of the victim girl has lodged the FIR without any iota of truth. The contention of P.W.6 has also been corroborated by P.W.7 and this P.W.7 is none but the witness of the Kabinnama. It is further evident from the medical report and the testimony of the doctor who appeared as P.W.5 that they did not find any recent sign of forcible sexual intercourse, so it is very much clear from this evidence that the doctor found no sign of sexual intercourse nor any use of force. So, it is clear that she was the consenting party to the intercourse. So, the contention of the prosecution has no legs to stand rather the contention of P.Ws.6 and 7 have strong legal footing.<br/><br/>The learned Tribunal has opined that the victim was minor at the time occurrence but this contention has not been supported by the kabinnama (as to marriage between the accused and the victim) where the age has been shown as 18 years, but the medical report shows that she was 13 to 14 years. The Tribunal has observed that at the time of occurrence the victim was about 13-14 years old and the consent of a girl aged below 16 years as to consent of marriage is absolutely immaterial.<br/><br/>In the Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology by Jaising P Modi, it has been observed that the principle to form a fairly accurate opinion about the age of an individual, especially in earlier years, are teeth height and weight, ossification of bones and minor signs. In ascertaining the age of young persons, radiograms of several main joints of the upper or the lower extremely of one or both sides of the body should be taken.<br/><br/>We should bear in mind that age is always depend upon the growth of the person who has been examined, a male or female of 18 years can be found as 15 or 16 years due to lack of his or her development of the body and again a male or female of 18 years can be found as 19 or 20 years and the reason is that his or her development and puberty was earlier.<br/><br/>So, the opinion of the doctor as to the age of the victim is not authenticated one in our view because the way the victim should be examined has not been done. There is no opinion as to the teeth, because as per Modi’s Medical Jurisprudence to ascertain the age of any person teeth is an important factor. ‘Modi’ has also observed ‘the progressive increase in height and weight according to age varies so greatly in individuals that it cannot be depend upon in estimating age in medico legal cases.’ <br/><br/>As we have already found that there is nothing as to abduction in the instant case rather it is a case of elopement and the way the opinion of the doctor as to ascertaining age has been given, in our view, is not a proper one so, we do not find any reason to convict the appellant under the provision of Nari-0-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2003, thus, we find merit in the instant appeal.   <br/><br/>In the result, the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 28/03/2011 passed by the learned judge Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Special Tribunal, Kushtia in Nari-O-Shishu Case No.165 of 2009 arising out of Kushtia Police Station Case No.7 dated 10/11/2008 corresponding to G.R. Case No.394 of 2008 under section 7 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain 2000 is here by set-aside. The convict appellant is acquitted from the charge leveled against him. The convict-appellant Mehedi Hasan alias Rasel be set at liberty at once, if not wanted in connection with any other case or cases.<br/><br/>Send down the L.C. records and comm-unicate this order at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

The plaintiff-petitioner entered into the possession of the suit land and possessing the same by cultivating paddy therein. Subseq-uently, the property was enlisted as evacuee property and recorded in the name of the Government under khas khatian. The plaintiff-petitioner being found in possession for more than 12 years Bangladesh Government by a registered deed dated 11.12.1974 settled a portion of the scheduled property covered by plot No. 2376 measuring .09 acre and 2378 measuring .21 acre of land to the plaintiff-petitioner. The defendant in suit by creating fraudulent document managed to get their names recorded in the khatian in connivance with the Government officials and on the basis of wrong khatian they tried to obstruct the plaintiff from cultivating the suit land as a result of which the plaintiff-petitioner constrained to file the suit for declaration of title and for declaration to the effect that the khatian stand recorded in the name of the defendants is illegal, void and without any basis. The defendant-opposite parties No. 1-6 appeared in the suit and filed written statement denying all the material allegations made in the plaint contending, inter alia, that the property in question was originally belonged to Moharaja Taraka Nath Chowdhury who died leaving 3  minor sons, namely, Korma Nath Chowdhury, Rudhra Nath Chowdhury and Seko Nath Chowdhury. The said heirs of Moharaja Taraka Nath Chowdhury being minor the property was managed and controlled by the Court of Wards. The Officers of the said Court of Wards made a settlement for .42 acres of land out of plot No. 2378 to the defendants No. 1,2 and 4  and on the basis of said settlement S.A. Khatian stand recorded in the name of the defendants. Thereafter on coming to know about obtaining settlement of .21 acres of land by the plaintiff, defendant No.1 filed an objection petition before the A.D.C. (Rev.) for cancellation of the lease/ settlement who upon hearing and considering facts and circumstances of the case cancelled the settlement for .12 acres of land covered by plot No. 2378 keeping .09 acre of land in the name of the plaintiff. The defendants having been possessing .42 acres of land out of .51 acres covered by plot No. 2378 , the plaintiff has/ had no title and possession beyond .09 acre of land  covered by plot No. 2378 and prayed for dismissal of the suit.<br/><br/>The trial court upon contested hearing dismissed the suit by its judgment and decree dated 25.9.83. Thereafter the plaintiff preferred Other Class Appeal No. 16 of 1984 before the District Judge, Thakurgaon which was eventually heard by the learned Subordinate Judge, Thakurgaon who upon contested hearing allowed the appeal in part holding that the defendants admits the title and possession of the plaintiff to the extent of .09 acre of land covered by plot No. 2376  and .09 acre covered by plot No., 2378 and as such the plaintiff is entitled to get a decree in respect of .18 acre of land and decreed the suit in part by its judgment and decree dated 19.3.1985  instead of decreeing the suit for .60 acres of land. The Appellate Court further observed that the A.D.C. (Rev.) cannot cancel a registered documents making settlement of the suit property in favour of the plaintiff without intervention  of the civil court.  The plaintiff-petitioner being aggrieved by the judgment filed an application under section 152 of the Code of Civil Procedure praying for decreeing the suit for .39 acres of land instead of .18 acres. The Appellate Court heard the application and upon hearing rejected the same by impugned order dated 20.7.85 holding that the court found title and possession of the plaintiff-appellant in .18 acres of land only and accordingly decreed the same and for remaining quantum of land, the lower appellate court found no title and possession of the plaintiff as such the  claim to the extent of .42 acres of land was refused and the lower appellate court  also found that there was no clerical mistake in the judgment.<br/><br/>No one appears to press the rule.<br/><br/>Perused the application, judgment passed by the lower court and impugned order rejecting the application under section 152 of the code of Civil Procedure.<br/><br/>From perusal of the judgment of the appellate court it appears that the court decreed the suit in part on clear finding that the plaintiff could prove title and possession in respect of .18 acres of land only and on that finding the appeal was allowed. In the event of dissatis-faction of the plaintiff-appellant it was open for the plaintiff-appellant either to go for revision against the judgment and decree or to file an application for review of the judgment but the plaintiff-appellant without taking recourse to revision or review filed an application under section 152 of the code of Civil Procedure seeking amendment of the judgment and decree. . To appreciate the point in dispute, section 152 C.P.C. is reproduced below,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“Section 152- Amendment of judgments, decrees or orders- Clerical or Arithmetical mistakes in judgment and decrees or orders or errors arising therein from any accidental slip  or omission  may at any time be corrected by the court either of its own motion or on the application of any of the parties”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Section 152 provides provision for correction of clerical or arithmetical mistake in judgment. Under this section  clerical or arithmetical  mistake in the judgment, decree or order or errors arising therefrom can be corrected by the court but in the instant case the lower appellate court below found no mistake or error in the judgment and decree . It is also found that the plaintiff-appellant sought correction of judgment on mistaken view of law for which remedy is provided by Order 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure. If the decree is sought to be varied for any reason other than the clerical error or arithmetical mistake it can be done only by review or by preferring revision but the petitioner filed application under section 152 C.P.C. seeking variation of the judgment which cannot come within the purview of section 152. For the reasons stated above I do not find any illegality in the impugned order passed by the appellate court in rejecting the application under section 152  of the Code of Civil Procedure and as such the rule is liable to be discharged.<br/><br/>In the result the rule is discharged without any order as to costs.<br/><br/>Send down the lower court records with a copy of this judgment to the court concerned at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Ziaul Karim, J:</u></strong><br/> <br/>By this appeal, the convict-appellants namely 1. Sumon Meah alias Sumon, 2. Shohel Meah alias Sohel Rana, 3. Api Meah have challenged the legality and propriety of the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 31-10-2005 passed by learned Judge of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal no.1, Bogra, in Nari-O-Shishu Case no. 1201 of 2002 convicting the appellants under Section 7 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Damon Ain, 2000(briefly as Ain-2000) and sentencing each of them to suffer imprisonment for life and also to pay a fine of Tk. 5,000/- in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for two years more.<br/><br/>The prosecution case as projected in the first information report and unfurled at trial are that Most. Nasrin Sultana Eti (P.W. 2) aged about 13 years was a student of Class VIII in Kappor High School, on 16-04-2001 on the way to her home from private tutor, at about 11.00 a.m. while she reached near Shallow machine room of Badsha Meah, then suddenly all the accused being armed with dagger emerged from the room and resisted her. Accused Sumon threatened her by pointing dagger and accused Api wrapped her mouth by napkin and all the accused dragged her inside the said room. Having had heard the screaming the locals namely Abdus Salam, Vikku Meah (P.W.4), Md. Hamidul Islam (P.W.3), Abdul Mollah (P.W.5), Sabdul Mollah (P.W.6) rushed to the scene, sensing danger the accused departed from there. The locals heard about the incident from the victim. Then they took the victim in her home. The prosecution was launched by lodging a first information report (briefly as FIR) by the father of the victim Md. Tofazzal Hossain (P.W.1) as informant which was recorded as Sonatola Police Station Case no.15 dated 19-04-2001 corresponding to G.R. no.48 of 2001.<br/><br/>The Police after investigation submitted charge sheet under Sections 7, 30 of the Ain-2000 accusing the appellants.<br/><br/>Eventually the appellants were called upon to answer the charge under Section 7 of the Ain-2000 which was read over to them who pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/><br/>In course of trial the prosecution in all, examined 8 witnesses out of 10 charge sheeted witnesses.<br/><br/>After closer of the prosecution case the accused were examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure again they repeated their innocence but led no evidence in defence.<br/><br/>The defence case as it appears from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses are that of innocence and false implication. It is divulged in defence that due to internal feud they were falsely implicated out of vengence for long standing land disputes and civil litigations.<br/><br/>After trial the learned Judge of the Court below convicted the accused as aforesaid.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate appearing for the appellants seeks to impeach the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence on three fold arguments.<br/><br/>Firstly, there is no eye witness of the occurrence.<br/><br/>Secondly, the important witnesses like local Chairman, Abdul Majid, Badsha Meah, private tutor and other teachers of the school were not examined by the prosecution which cast a serious doubt upon the prosecution case.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the alleged offence, even if it is accepted as true but denied do not constitute the offence of abduction (AfqlZ) and as such does not come within the purview of section 7 of the Ain-2000. Moreover, the accused had no control and possession over the victim for certain period. In support of his contentions the learned Counsel refers the case of Kazi Nurun Nabi Parag and others Vs. State 15 BLC-518 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“<em>Be that as it may when no evidence has been adduced in Court about kidnapping of the victim or her recovery from the possession of the accused appellant Kazi Nurun Nabi alias Parag vis-à-vis when there is no evidence about the commission of rape upon the victim, we are constrained to hold the view that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the charge leveled against the appellants in any way and the trial Court convicted the appellants on mere surmise and conjectures and thus the impugned judgment and order is liable to be set aside we find merit in this appeals.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The learned Counsel lastly submits that the judgment and order of conviction and sentence based on misreading and non consideration of the evidence on record which cannot be sustained in the eye of law.<br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the State opposes the appeal and submits that the learned Judge of the Court below after considering the evidence on record rightly found the accused guilty under Ain-2000. He adds that the prosecution is not bound to produce all the witnesses named in the charge sheet to prove the charge. In support of his contentions the learned Counsel refers the case of Md. Shakhowat Hossain Vs. State 25 BLD-75 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“<em>Prosecution is not bound to produce all the witnesses said to have observed the occurrence. Material witnesses considered necessary by the prosecution for unfolding prosecution story alone need be produced without unnecessary and redundant multiplication of witnesses.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The learned Counsel lastly submits that the evidence of all the prosecution witnesses are uniform and consistant. So the conviction and sentence was rightly awarded to them which calls for no interference by this Court.<br/><br/>In order to appreciate their submissions we have gone through the record and given our anxious consideration to their submissions.<br/><br/>Now the question calls for consideration, is, whether the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence can be sustained in the eye of law.<br/><br/>Let us now weigh and sift the evidence on record as adduced by the prosecution to prove the charge.<br/><br/>P.W.1 Md. Tafazzal Hossaion, is the informant and father of the victim and he was the teacher in Mahagora Primary School. He deposed that on 16-04-2001 at 11:00 a.m. his daughter Nasrin Sultana (Eti) aged about 13 years, student of Class VIII on the way to home from Private tutor, while she reached on the Dharmaqul Pugulia road adjacent to the Shallow Machine room of Badsha Meah (briefly as P.O.) then the accused being armed with dagger resisted her; accused Sumon pointed a dagger and accused Api Meah wrapped her mouth by a napkin. Then they forcibly dragged her inside the said machine room. On hearing screaming locals namely Abdus Salam, Vikku Meah, Hamidul Islam, Abdul Molla, Sabdul Molla and others rushed to the scene and the accused departed from there. They heard the occurrence from her and took her in home. Having had heard the incident on the following day he went to the Police Station for lodging FIR but on the way he met with local Chairman Abdul Majid who assured him that he will sent the FIR to the Police Station but subsequently with no effect. Then on 19-04-2001 he lodged FIR which he proved it as Exhbt. 1 and his signature on it Exhbt. 1/1. He identified the accused on dock.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that accused Sumon and Sohag are full brothers and accused Api was their machine operator. He did not disclose the occurrence to any one except Police before lodging the FIR ; Victim’s school starts at 11-00 a.m. and father of the accused Sumon was also a teacher of a Primary School and he was his distant relation. He denied the suggestion that on the date of occurrence his daughter did not go to private tutor; no such occurrence took place and for the long standing land disputes the accused were implicated in this case.<br/><br/>P.W. 2, Most. Nasrin Sultana Eti, victim of this case. She deposed that on 16-04-2001 at 11:00 a.m. on the way to her home from Private tutor and while she reached at P.O. then the accused Sumon, Sohel, Api emerged from Shallow machine room and resisted her; accused Sumon pointed a dagger and accused Api wrapped her by napkin and dragged her inside the room. On hearing screaming locals namely Hamidul, Vikku, Samad, Abdul, Sabdul and others rushed to the scene and accused departed from there, to whom she narrated the occurrence. She identified the accused on dock.<br/><br/>In cross-examination she stated that she used to go to school alone. Machine room was situated about 15/20 cubits away from the road. She did not take any medical treatment. She denied the suggestion that no occurrence took place as she alleged and for the cause of land litigations the accused were falsely implicated.<br/><br/>P.W. 3, Md. Hamidul Islam, deposed that at the relevant time he was in the paddy field; hearing the screaming he rushed to the Shallow machine room and found three persons were running away. Meanwhile Abdul and Sabdul also happened there. The victim narrated the occurrence to them to the effect that the accused tried to rape her and during scuffle the napkin was displaced and she screamed. He identified the accused on dock.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that on the following day he made statement to the Police. He denied the suggestion that no such occurrence took place and he was deposing falsely.<br/><br/>P.W.4 Vikku Meah deposed that on the date of occurrence he was working in the paddy field, on hearing screaming he rushed to the Shallow machine room and found the victim was weeping and her wearing apparels were dusty. The victim narrated the occurrence to him. He identified the accused on dock.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he denied the suggestion that what he has stated in the Court was not stated to the Police.<br/><br/>P.W. 5, Abdul Molla, deposed that at the time of occurrence he was cutting grass. On hearing the screaming he rushed to the Shallow machine room wherefrom the accused were departed. He found witness Sabdul and Vikku there.  The victim was weeping out side the room and her wearing apparels were full of dust. The victim narrated the occurrence to them. Some wearing apparels were seized (Exhbts. 2, 2/1).<br/><br/>In cross-examination he denied the suggestion that what he has stated in the Court was not stated to I.O. and deposing falsely.<br/><br/>P.W.6, Sabdul Molla deposed that on 16-04-2001 at 11:00 a.m. he was cutting grass in the field. On hearing the screaming he rushed to the machine room and found the accused Sumon, Sohel and Api were running away. He also found Hamidul, Vikku and Abdul inside the machine room. He found that the victim was weeping out side the room and her wearing apparels were full of dust.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he denied the suggestion that he was deposing falsely.<br/><br/>P.W.7 Md. Uzzal Hossain, the local witness. He deposed that in his presence Police seized some wearing apparels and prepared seizure list (Exhbts. 2, and 2/2).<br/><br/>In cross-examination he denied the suggestion that what he has stated in the Court was not stated to I.O. and deposing falsely.<br/><br/>P.W. 8 S.I. Md. Abdul Quadir deposed that on 19-04-2001 he was attached with Sonotala Police Station. He filled up the form of F.I.R. (Exhbt. 3). He took up the investigation, visited P.O., prepared sketch map and index (Exhbts. 4 and 5). He recorded the statements of the witnesses under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Thereafter he submitted charge sheet accusing the accused.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that he had shown ‘B’ in a sketch map, which was the Shallow machine room of Badsha Meah, 4/5  cubits away from the P.O. He recorded the statement of the victim under section 161 Cr.P.C. but he did not reduce it in writing. P.W.3 Md. Hamidul Islam and P.W.4 Vikku Meah did not state to him that the victim was weeping and her wearing apparels were full of dust. P.W. 5 Abdul Molla, did not state to him that at the time of occurrence Abdus Samad and others happened at the scene ; accused were hiding inside the Shallow machine room and they resisted the victim and Sumon pointed with a dagger and the accused departed from scene. P.W. 6 Sabdul Molla, did not state to him that the victim was weeping out of fear. He denied the suggestion that he did not held investigation properly and deposing falsely.<br/><br/>These are all of the evidence on record adduced by the prosecution to prove the charge.<br/><br/>At the very outset and for the conve-nience of understanding Section 2(M) and Section 7 of the Ain-2000 read as hereunder:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>Section 2(M)</em> <em>“</em>অপহরণ অর্থ বলপ্র­য়াগ বা প্রলুব্ধ করিয়া বা ফুসলাহ~য়া বা ভুল বুঝাইয়া  বা ভীতি প্রদর্শন করিয়া কোন সহান হই­ত কোন ব্যও্রি­ক অন্যত্র যাই­ত বাধ্য করা<em>”</em><br/><em>Section 7-</em> নারী ও শিশু অপহর­ণের  শাস্তি - যদি  কোন ব্যও্রি ধারা (৫) এ উল্লিখিত কোন অপরাধ সংঘট­নের উ­দ্দশ্যে ব্যতীত অন্য কোন উদ্দ­­শ্য কোন নারী বা শিশুকে অপহরণ ক­রেন, তাহা হই­­ল উক্ত ব্যক্তি যাবজ্জীবন কারাদ­­ন্ড  বা অন্যুন চৌদ্দ বৎসর সংশ্রম কারাদ­­ন্ড দন্ডনীয় হই­বেন এবং ইহার অতিরিক্ত  অর্থদ­ন্ড ও দন্ডনীয়  হবেন<em>”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The term “abduction” as it appears in Black’s Law Dictionary runs in the following manner:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“<em>Abduction(ab-dak-shon), 1. The act of leading someone away by force or fraudulent persuasion. Some jurisdictions have various elements added to this basic definition, such as that the abductor must have the intent to marry or defile the person, that the abductee must be an underage child, or that the abductor must have the intent to subject the abductee to concubinage or prostitution. 2. Archaic. At common law, the crime of taking away a female person without her consent by use of persuasion, fraud , or violence, for the purpose of marriage, prostitution, or illicit sex.- abduct, vb. abductor, n.- abductee, n. kidnapping.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“There was no such crime as abduction known to the English common law, but a statute passed a few years before Columbus discovered America, created a felony which is the forerunner of all the present statutes on abduction “ Rollin M. Perkins &amp; Ronald N. Boyee Criminal Law 183 (3rd ed. 1982).”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In course of trial the prosecution in all examined 8 witnesses, of them P.W.1, is the informant and father of the victim. P.W. 2, is the victim herself. P.W.1, 3-6 heard the occurrence from victim (PW 2) and P.W.7 is the local seizure list witness. P.W. 8 is the investigating officer(I.O.)<br/><br/>Therefore the prosecution case absolutely rest on the evidence of victim P.W. 2, Nasrin Sultana Eti. P.Ws.3-6 were examined to corroborate her in respect of alleged occurrence. P.W.2, categorically stated that on 16-04-2001 at 11:00 a.m. on the way to her home from private tutor and when she reached on the road near to the shallow machine room of Badsha Meah, then the accused resisted her and on the point of dagger all the accused dragged her inside the machine room. On hearing screaming the locals namely Hamid, Vikku, Samad, Abdul, Sabdul rushed to the scene and accused departed from there.<br/><br/>P.Ws. 3-6 in their evidence categorically stated that they found the victim on the road and the victim narrated the occurrence to them. P.W. 8 investigating officer who recorded the statements of those witnesses under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. They did not state the material facts as narrated by the victim to him but in their evidence before Court they stated that they found the victim was weeping and her wearing apparels were full of dust but such facts were not stated to PW. 8. Moreso, P.W. 8 stated that P.W.6 did not state to him regarding pointing of dagger by accused Sumon and dragged the victim inside the machine room. So these are the material omissions on the part of the above witnesses. P.W. 1 although is not the eye witness to the occurrence but he categorically stated that before lodging FIR he disclosed the occurrence to none except Police.<br/><br/>After close scrutiny of their evidence we find that at the earliest point of time those witnesses did not disclose the material facts either to the Investigating Officer or to the locals which makes the prosecution case shaky.<em> It is well settled that when an eye witness to the occurrence that took place at the morning does not disclose the names of the assailants he allegedly recognized and other material facts to the witnesses who came to the scene immediately after the occurrence was over or at the earliest opportunity</em> <em>and there is no justifiable reason for nondisclosure of the material facts, belated discloser of material facts renders their evidence/ testimony doubtful. In such a case the Court should reasonably infer that the story of recognition of the assailants was a subsequent embellishment. With this regard reliance is being placed in the case of Asadur Rahman alias Asad vs. The State 15 DLR 290. Similar view was taken in the case of Abdur Rouf Moral and others Vs. The State 7 BLT 310. </em><br/><br/><em>It is also well settled that when an eye witness witnessed the occurrence, accused person departed from the scene and many people assembled at the place of occurrence followed by officials. It is expected that the eye witnesses will name the accused persons not only to their own kith and kin but also to uninvolved persons, including high officials. Belated discloser of the names of the assailants make their evidence doubtful. With this regard reliance is being placed in the case of Nowabul Alam and others Vs. The State 15 BLD (AD) 55. </em>Therefore we hold that their belated discloser of material facts is vulnerable to the credibility and as such the same are incompatible aswellas incredible<em>.</em><br/><br/>We should bear in mind, credibility of testimony oral and circumstantial, depends considerably on a judicial evaluation of the totality, not isolated scrutiny. When dealing with the serious question of guilt or innocence of persons charged with crime, the following principles should be taken into consideration.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">a) The onus of proving everything essential to the establishment of the charge against the accused lies on the prosecutor.<br/>b) The evidence must be such asto exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.<br/>c) In matters of doubt it is safer to acquit than to condemn, for it is better that several guilty persons should escape than that one innocent person suffer.<br/>d) There must be clear and unequivocal proof of the corpus delicit.<br/>e) The hypothesis of delinquency should be consistent with all the facts proved.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Inspite of the presumption of truth attached to oral evidence under oath if the Court is not satisfied, the evidence inspite of oath is of no avail.<br/><br/>It is pertinent to point that the occurrence took place on Dharmakul Puglia road within Sonatola Police Station adjacent to the Shallow machine room of Badsha Meah but except the evidence of P.W. 2 there is no other evidence that she was taken inside the room as the other locals witnesses namely P.Ws. 3-6 found the victim on the road. Therefore, we find that there is no corroborative evidence in respect of taking the victim অন্যত্র as occurred in section 2(M) of the Ain-2000. Where the evidence of the prosecutrix forms the only witness on which the Court is to act upon. It is absolutely necessary for the ends of justice that at least victim’s statement must be inconformity with the probability and in a case like this the evidence of solitary witness calls for corroboration as a rule of prudence but such corroboration is absent in this case. So it is very unsafe to convict the accused, relying on the evidence of PW-2. Moreso, there is no evidence that the accused had exclusive control and possession over the victim for a certain period. So, such allegations will not come within the ambit of section 2(M) of the Ain-2000.<br/><br/>It further appears that local Chairman Abdul Majid, who took a very significant step in respect of lodging FIR and subsequently he tried to dissolve the matter in issue by amicable settlement, other locals namely Badsha Meah, private tutor and other teachers of the school who were acquainted with the facts were not examined by the prosecution to corroborate the victim. So the legal presumption would be had they been examined they would not have supported the prosecution case.<br/><br/>On close scrutiny of the evidence on record we find that the evidence all the prosecution witnesses suffered from glaring contradictions inconsistencies and infirmities. So the same are vulnerable to the credibility and it is very difficulty to rely on their testimony. Moreover, it is the definite case of the prosecution that there was an internal feud between the parties and when there is a background of enmity and the witnesses are chance witnesses and not natural witnesses and further natural and independent witness were not examined, it is unsafe to rely on the evidence of chance witnesses to make a nexus between the accused and the crime. So we hold that there is no cogent, convincing and unimpeachable evidence on record to prove the complicity of the accused with the crime of abduction (অপহরণ). Prosecution utterly failed to bring home guilt to the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<br/><br/>Moreover, the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence in its entirety is not well founded in the facts and circumst-ances of the case. So the ground urged and contentions advanced by the learned Counsel for the State are not the correct exposition of law, however we have gone through the decision reported in 25 DLR-75 as referred by him. We are in respectful agreement with the principles enunciated therein but the facts leading to that case is quite distinguishable to that of the instant case. Therefore, we are unable to accept his submissions. On the contrary the legal pleas taken by the defence prevails and appears to have a good deal of force.<br/><br/>In the light of discussions made above we are of the view that the prosecution measurably failed to prove the charge against the appellants beyond all reasonable doubt. So, the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence suffers from legal infirmities, which calls for interference by this Court. Thus the appeal having merit succeeds.<br/><br/>In the result the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 31-10-2005 passed by learned Judge of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal no. 1, Bogra, in Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Case no. 1201 of 2002 is hereby set aside. The appellants are acquitted from the charge leveled against them. The appellants who are on bail be discharged from their respective bail bond.<br/><br/>The office is directed to send down the records at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Ziaul Karim, J:</u></strong><br/> <br/>This Death Reference under Section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (briefly as the Code) has been made by learned Metro-politan Additional Sessions Judge, fourth Court, Dhaka, for confirmation of death sentences of condemned-prisoners.<br/><br/>By the above appeals the appellants have challenged the legality and propriety of the Judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 27-03-2007 passed by learned Metrop-olitan Additional Sessions Judge, fourth Court, Dhaka, in Metro. Session Case no. 1738 of 2006, convicting the appellants under Clause 1(b) of the Table of Section 19(1) of the Narcotics Control Act, 1990 (briefly as Act, 1990) and sentencing each of them to death by hanging and also to pay a fine of Tk. 5,000/-each.<br/>    <br/>This death reference, all the above appeals having arisen out of a common judgment, these have been heard together and are being disposed of by this judgment.<br/><br/>The prosecution case as projected in the first information report (briefly as FIR) and unfurled at trial are that C-Md. Altaf Hossain (PW-1) came to learn from a secret source before six months from the occurrence that a gang of accused were the heroin-traffickers. Later, at the instruction of Major Md. Kamruzzaman, Company Commander of CPC-3, Cop-Md. Nazmul Haq (PW-2) acquainted with them incognito as a purchaser of heroin. They (accused) proposed to sale one K.G. of heroin at the price of Tk.80 lacs. He (PW-2) agreed to it and he would take delivery of the aforesaid heroin on 10-07-2006 at 5-30 p.m. at the rented house no. 106/1, Senpara Parbata, Mirpur-10, DMP of Zoynal (briefly as P.O.). Accordingly on 10-07-2006 since 5:00 p.m. he (PW-1) along with other law enforcers lay in wait around the P.O. to nab the traffickers. Then, Cop. Md. Nazmul (PW-2) and Sepoy  Md.Masud Rana (PW-4) went inside the P.O. to take delivery of heroin which was kept in a bag wrapped by talc paper made of reskin. At the time of delivery and having had heard the signal the above law enforcers happened at the scene and nabbed the accused on the spot. DAD Md. Akmal Hossain (PW-3) then prepared seizure list in presence of locals namely Md. Zakir Hossain (PW.-7), Md. Monir Hossain (PW-8). The accused identified themselves as Shymdulal Debnath and Saiful Islam and admitted that they brought the heroin by smuggling from boarder area. Later the accused and seized heroin were handed over to the Mirpur P.S. With these allegations the prosecution was launched by lodging a FIR by PW-1 as informant which was recorded as Mirpur P.S. Case no. 32(7) of 2007.<br/><br/>The Police after investigation submitted charge sheet under Clause 1(b) of the Table of Section 19(1) of the Act-1990 accusing the condemned-prisoners as accused.<br/><br/>Eventually, the case was taken up for trial by the Metropolitan Additional Sessions Judge, fourth Court, Dhaka, wherein the accused were called upon to answer the charge under Clause 1(b) of the Table of Section 19(1) of the Act 1990 and the accused on dock pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/><br/>In course of trial the prosecution in all, examined nine witnesses out of twenty charge sheeted witnesses and the defence examined none.<br/><br/>After closure of the prosecution case the accused on dock were examined under Section 342 of the Code and again they repeated their innocence and led no evidence in defence.<br/><br/>The defence case as it appears from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses are that of innocence and false implication. It was divulged in defencee that due to internal feud they were falsely implicated out of vengeance by their local rivals.<br/><br/>After trial the learned Judge convicted the accused as aforesaid holding:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(a) The prosecution successfully proved the charge under Clause 1(b) of the Table of Section 19(1) of the Act-1990 against the convicts.<br/>(b) The prosecution succeeded to prove the recovery of the alleged heroin from the exclusive control and possession of the convicts.<br/>(c)The evidence of prosecution witnesses are consistent, uniform and corroborative with each other with all material particulars in respect of recovery of incriminiting materials from the accused.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the State supports the reference and submits that the Court below after considering evidence on record rightly found that the incriminating heroin were recovered from the exclusive control and possession of the convicts. He adds that all the locals and seizure list witnesses categorically proved the said recovery from the convicts. So the conviction and sentence awarded upon them was just and proper which calls for no interference by this Court.<br/> <br/>The learned Counsels appearing for the condemned–prisoners by their common contentions seek to impeach the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence on four fold arguments:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong><u>Firstly:</u></strong>  The prosecution failed to prove the recovery of alleged heroin from the possession of the appellants.<br/><strong><u>Secondly:</u></strong> The prosecution failed to examine the independent witness in support of the charge. So the conviction and sentence is not sustainable in the eye of law.<br/><strong><u>Thirdly: </u></strong>There is no nexus between the convicts and the tenant of the P.O. So there was no cause to go to that P. O. by the convicts. Therefore, the manner of occurrence is quite doubtful.<br/><strong><u>Fourthly:</u></strong> The Judgment and order of conviction and sentence based on misreading and non-consideration of the evidence on record which cannot be sustained in the eye of law.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In order to appreciate their submissions we have gone through the record and given our anxious considerations to their submissions.<br/><br/>Let us now weigh and sift the evidence on record as adduced by the prosecution to prove the charge.<br/>P.W. 1, C-Md. Altaf Hossain was the informant. He deposed that before six month of the occurrence Cop-Nazmul acquainted with some heroin traffickers. Afterwards at the instruction of the Company Commander Major Kamruzzaman Cop. Nazmul in the guise of a heroin purchaser maintained a good relation with the traffickers. Accordingly on 10-07-2006 the accused invited Cop. Nazmul to take delivery of one K.G. of heroin at the price of Tk. eighty lacs from the P.O. On the same day at 4-30 p.m. he along with other law enforcers took possession around the P.O. incognito. At 5:00 p.m. accused Shymdulal Debnath took them in the house of Zoynal tenant of Sazzad at 106/1, Senpara Parbata (P.O.). Later at their signal he along other with law enforcers entered into that house. At the time of handing over the said heroin the accused Saiful and Shymdulal Debnath were caught red-handed with heroin. A seizure list was prepared and the accused with heroin were handed over to the Police Station. On the following day, with these allegations he lodged the FIR (Exhbt. 1) and his signature on it (Exhbt. 1/1). He proved the seized heroin (Mat. Exhbt. 1). He identified the accused Dulal and Saiful on the dock.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he denied the suggestion that no heroin was seized from accused Shymdulal who was a cloth trader and accused Saiful was not present at the P.O. He stated that their body was searched by public. They did not take the money from the exchequer. He denied the suggestion that he was deposing falsely.<br/><br/>PW-2 Cop. Md. Nazmul Haq was the member of raiding party. He deposed that before six month of the occurrence he was acquainted with the heroin traffickers. On 10-07-2006 accused proposed him to present at Mirpur-10 to take deliver one K.G. heroin at the price of Taka eighty lacs. He along with Sepoy-Masud were present there in the guise of heroin purchasers. At this, accused Shymdulal took them at the house of Sazzad Hossain rented by one Zoynal at 106/1, Senpara Parbata, Mirpur-10. At his signal other law enforcers happened at the scene and at the time of handing over heroin accused were caught red-handed. DAD- Akmal prepared seizure list in presence of witnesses. The heroin wrapped with golden colour paper made in Pakistan were recovered from the accused. He identified the same as (Mat. Exhbt. 1) and the accused on dock.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that he cannot remember when the I.O. examined him. and the statement made before I.O. was true. He denied the suggestion that no heroin was recovered from the possession of accused.<br/><br/>P.W. 3 DAD-Md. Akmal Hossain was the member of the raiding party. He deposed that before 5/6 months of the occurrence Cop. Nazmul acquainted with the heroin traffickers and at the instruction of the Company Commander he maintained a good relation with them in the guise of a heroin purchaser. At one stage on 10-07-2006 Cop. Nazmul was asked to present at Mirpur-10 to take delivery of one K.G. of heroin at the price of taka eighty lacs. He along with other law enforcers were ambushed around the P.O. At the time of taking delivery of heroin from the P.O. he along with other law enforcers entered into there and caught the accused red-handed along with heroin. He seized and prepared seizure list (Exhbt.2) and his signature on it (Exhbt.2/1). He identified the accused on dock.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that he made statement before the I.O. and denied the suggestion that he was deposing falsely.<br/><br/>P.W. 4 Sepoy Md. Masud Rana was the member of raiding party. He deposed that before 6/7 months of the occurrence Cop. Nazmul was acquainted with heroin traffickers. On 10-07-2006 he along with other law enforcers went to Mirpur-10 from-where he along with Cop. Nazmul went at the P.O. house. At the time of delivery of heroin by the accused other law enforcers happened at the scene and nabbed the accused. DAB-Akmal prepared seizure list. He identified accused on dock.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he deposed that he could not remember when I.O. interrogated him and denied the suggestion that he deposed falsely.<br/><br/>P.W. 5 Md. Zoynal, a rickshaw-puller, P.W.6 Md. Tofazzal Hossain are the local witnesses. They deposed that Police made them witnesses but they had no knowledge about the occurrence.<br/><br/>In cross-examination they stated that they did not see the recovery of heroin.<br/><br/>P.W.7 Md. Zakir Hossain, a local seizure list witness. He deposed that before 4/5 months the occurrence took place. He had an electronic shop at 107/1, Senpara Parbata. At 3:30 /4:00 p.m. a man came and asked him to go with him and told that heroin was recovered from accused Saiful and Shymdulal and took his signature on a blank paper (Exhbt.2) and his signature on it as (Exhbt.2/2). He could not remember whether the accused were present at the dock.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that he did not see to seize any alamats.<br/><br/>P.W. 8 Md. Monir Hossain, a local seizure list witness. He deposed that the occurrence took place before 3/4 months and he was dealing in battle-nut; at 11/12 0’Clock members of the RAB called him and they showed one packet of heroin which was recovered from the possession of the accused and took his signature on a blank paper (Exhbt.2) and his signature on it (Exhbt.2/3).<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that he did not see the recovery of the alamats and put his signature on a blank paper.<br/><br/>P.W. 9 S.I. Md. Mohsin Ali deposed that the case was subsequently entrusted to him for investigation. He visited the P.O. and consulted the sketch map and index prepared by former I.O., S.I. Al-Mamun. He recorded the statements of the witnesses under Section 161 of the Code. He referred the seized heroin for chemical examination and collected the report. He proved the same (Exhbt.3). After investigation he submitted charge-sheet under Clause 1(b) of the Table of Section 19(1) of the Act 1990 accusing the condemned-prisoners as accused.<br/><br/>In cross–examination he stated that the owner of the P.O. house Sazzad Hossain did not reside there. He denied the suggestion that he made perfunctory investigation and submitted charge sheet.<br/><br/>These are all of the evidence on record adduced by the prosecution to prove the charge.<br/>In course of trial the prosecution in all examined nine witnesses. Of them P.Ws.1, 2, 3, and 4 were the members of the raiding party, of whom PWs. 2 and 4 went inside the P.O. in the guise of purchasing heroin from the accused and P.W.1 is the informant of the case. P.Ws. 5 and 6 are the local neighbouring witnesses. PWs. 7 and 8 are the seizure list witnesses, P.W. 9 was the investigating officer and submitted charge-sheet accusing the condemned-prisoners as accused.<br/><br/>On appraisal of the evidence on record it transpires that the prosecution case was absolutely rest upon the evidence of law enforcers aswellas the seizure list witnesses. P.W.2 Cop. Nazmul Haq testified that before six months of the occurrence he developed a good relation in the guise of heroin purchaser with the gang of heroin traffickers i.e. accused. Accordingly on 10-07-2006 at the instruction of their Company Commander he along with P.W.4, Sepoy-Masud Rana went at the P.O. to take delivery of one K.G. of heroin at the price of taka eighty lacs from the accused. Afterwards at the time of delivery of heroin the other law enforcers happened at the scene and caught the accused namely Symdulal Debnath and Saiful Islam red-handed with heroin. P.W.3, DAD-Md. Akmal Hossain prepared seizure list in presence of P.W. 7 Md. Zakir Hossain and PW. 8 Md. Monir Hossain. Later, the accused along with heroin were handed over to the local Police Station. P.W. 4, Sepoy Md. Masud Rana supported the evidence of P.W. 2 in respect of recovery of alleged heroin from the possession of the accused. P.W.1 and P.W. 3 were the members of the raiding party. They corroborated the evidence of PWs. 2 and 4. P.Ws. 7 and 8 are the seizure list witnesses, they categorically stated that they put their respective signature in the seizure list and the seized heroin were shown to them. Although P.Ws. 5 and 6 did not support the evidence of other law enforcers and seizure list witnesses but the same will not materially affect the merit of this case. PW-9 S.I. Mohsin Ali investigated the case. He referred some sample of seized heroin to the Directorate of Narcotic Control for its examination by chemical Examiner. After examination, the examiner opined in the following manner:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“</em>খাকি  খামে একটি পলি কাগজের প্যাকে প্রাপ্ত বাদামী গুড়া পদার্থে হেরোইন পাওয়া গিয়াছে <em>”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>So, heroin was detected in the seized incriminating article. PW-9, then obtained the report. He proved the same as exhibit-3. So the evidence of the above prosecution witnesses in respect of recovery of the incriminating heroin from the exclusive possession of accused Shumdulal Debnath and Md. Saiful Islam at the P.O. are consistent, uniform and corroborative with each other with all material particulars. There is absolutely no reason to disbelieve the consistent and corroborative evidence of those competent witnesses having no reason whats-oever to depose falsely against the condemned-prisoners. The defence extensively cross-examined them but nothing could be elicited to shake their credibility in any manner whatsoever. So the same are invulnerable to the credibility.<br/><br/>We should bear in mind, credibility of testimony oral and circumstantial, depends considerably on a judicial evaluation of the totality, not isolated scrutiny. When dealing with the serious question of guilt or innocence of persons charged with crime, the following principles should be taken into consideration.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">a) The onus of proving everything essential to the establishment of the charge against the accused lies on the prosecutor.<br/>b) The evidence must be such asto exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.<br/>c)  In matters of doubt it is safer to acquit than to condemn, for it is better that several guilty persons should escape than that one innocent person suffer.<br/>d) There must be clear and unequivocal proof of the corpus delicit.<br/>e) The hypothesis of delinquency should be consistent with all the facts proved.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Inspite of the presumption of truth attached to oral evidence under oath if the Court is not satisfied, the evidence inspite of oath is of no avail.<br/><br/>The credit to be given to the statement of a witness is a matter not regulated by rule of procedure, but depends upon his knowledge of fact to which he testifies his disinterestedness, his integrity and his veracity. Apportion of oral evidence depends on such variable in consistence which as a human nature can not be reduced as a set formula (40 DLR 58).<br/><br/>The weight to be attached to the testimony of witness depends in a large measure upon various consideration some of which are in the face of it his evidence should be in consonance with probabilities and consistent with other evidence, and should generally so fit in with material details of the case for the prosecution as to carry conviction of truth to a prudent mind. In a word evidence of a witness is to be looked at from point of view of its credibility, it is quite unsafe to discard evidence of witness which otherwise appears reasonable and probable because of some suggestion against truthfulness of the witness.<br/><br/>Therefore, we find that there are cogent convincing and unimpeachable evidence on record regarding the complicity of the accused in respect of recovery of the alleged heroin from their exclusive control and possession. The prosecution successfully proved the charge against the accused Shymdulal debnath and Md. Saiful Islam beyond all reasonable doubt. <br/><br/>Moreso, the impugned judgment and order of conviction is well founded in the facts and circumstances of the case. So the submissions advanced by the learned Deputy Attorney General prevails and appears to have a good deal of force. On the contrary the submissions advanced by the learned Counsels for the defence are not the correct exposition of law. So we are unable to accept their submissions.<br/><br/>In the light of discussions made above and the preponderant judicial views emerging out of the authorities refer to above we are of the view that the impugned judgment and order of conviction sufers from no legal infirmities which calls for no interference by this Court. <br/><br/>In respect of sentence of condemned-prisoners we hold that they are young men. Record indicates that condemned-prisoners are not the hard criminals and have been languishing in the condemned Cell for about five years with suffering of mental agony of death within the death cell. Taking an account of aggravating and mitigating circumstances ends of justice will be met if death sentences be altered to one of imprisonment for life. Condemned prisoners (1) Shymdulal Debnath, (2) Md. Saiful Islam alias Md. Saiful Islam Khan alias Dense Ali Khan each thus, stand sentenced to imprisonment for life with a fine of Tk.5,000/- each in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for three months more.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong>In the result:-</strong><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(a) The Death Reference no. 27 of 2007 is rejected.<br/>(b) The impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 27-03-2007 passed by learned Metropolitan Additional Sessions Judge, fourth Court, Dhaka, in Metro. Session Case no. 1738 of 2006 is confirmed with the modification of sentence to the effect that they are convicted under Clause 1(b) of the Table of Section 19(1) of the Narcotics Control Act-1990 and each of them sentenced to suffer imprisonment for life and also to pay a fine of Tk.5,000/- each in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for  three months more.<br/>(c) In view of the Provisions laid down in Section 35A(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure the total period the condemned-prisoners have been in custody before conviction in connection with this offence shall be deducted from the period of imprisonment for life awarded to them.<br/>(d) Accordingly, Criminal appeal nos. 1144 of 2007 and 1310 of 2007, Jail appeal nos. 233 of 2007 and 234 of 2007 are allowed in part in the above terms.<br/>The office is directed to send down the records at once.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Khandaker Halim of Bahubal Police Station (P.W.1) made an inquiry on an information recorded in G.D.E. no. 76 dated 03-01-2005 and found that two unknown male dead-bodies were lying at the eastern side of Dhaka-Sylhet high-way in between Daulatpur and Jashpal village (briefly as P.O.). The bodies bore ligature marks on the neck. It was suspected that the death was caused by strangulation. Meanwhile at 10:25 a.m. Advocate Bashir Ahmed Dulal (P.W.3) of Hobigonj Court happened at the scene and identified the dead-bodies as Babul and Ashraf Ali, driver and helper respectively of his micro-bus no. Dhaka-Metro-N-12-1590. He (P.W.3) informed that on 02-01-2005 at 2:30 p.m. driver and helper went to Chunarughat from his village Nizgaon with a passenger trip but they did not return in time. He unsuccessfully searched them. On 03-01-2005 at 9:00 a.m. he received an information of dead-bodies lying at the P.O. The locals were whispering that they found at 4:30 p.m. Sujon of village Nizgaon with his accomplice were roaming who were suspected to commit the crime of murder.  With these allegations the prosecution was launched by lodging a first information report (briefly as FIR) by S.I. Khandaker Halim (P.W.1) as informant which was recorded as Bahubal P.S. Case no. 03 date 03-01-2005 corresponding to G.R. no. 03 of 2005.<br/><br/>During investigation accused Sujon Deb, Borhanuddin, Afsaruddin alias Afsu, Sohel Khan, and Sani Ahmed Sentu made confessions before the learned Magistrate implicating theirselves along with accused Salam and Kalam.<br/>The Police after investigation submitted charge sheet under Sections 302,379,34,411 of the Penal Code accusing accused.<br/><br/>Eventually accused were called upon to answer the charge under Sections 302,34,379 and 411 of the Penal Code to which the accused on dock pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/>In course of trial the prosecution in all examined twenty witnesses out of twenty nine charge sheeted witnesses. Two witnesses were tendered by the prosecution. The defence examined none. <br/>After closure of prosecution case, the accused were examined under Section 342 of the Code, again they repeated their innocence and led no evidence in defence.<br/>The defence case as it appears from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses are that of innocence and false implication. It was divulged in defence that confession of Sujon deb was extracted by putting him in torture.<br/><br/>After trial the accused were convicted as aforesaid holding that:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(a)  The confession of accused Sujon deb is true and voluntary who disclosed the names of accused Salam, Kalam and also the others accused;<br/>(b) The stolen micro-bus was recovered from the possession of accused;<br/>(c) There are corroborative evidence against the accused. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the State supports the reference and submits that soon after the occurrence arrestees Sujon deb and four others made confessions. He adds that confessions are true and voluntary and there are corroborative evidence against the accused. He submits that PWs. 8 and 19 stated that accused Sujon deb disclosed the names of accused Kalam and Salam before them. So the Court below after considering  the materials on record rightly convicted the accused which calls for no interference by this Court.<br/> <br/>The learned Counsels appearing for the condemned-prisoners and appellants by their common contention seek to impeach the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence on five fold arguments:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong><u>Firstly :</u></strong> The  confession of Sujon deb was extracted by torture and the same is exculpatory in nature.<br/><strong><u>Secondly:</u></strong>  The deceaseds were killed by their negligence and fault. In support of their contention they refer the case of State Vs. Lalu Mia and others 39 DLR(AD)-117 held:<br/><strong>“</strong><em>confession- Exculpatory and inculpatory</em><em> confessions- Extent to which exculpatory confession can be  taken into consideration in judging truth or otherwise of the whole confession.</em><br/><em>Where there is no other evidence to show affirmatively that any portion of the exculpatory element in the confession is false, the Court must accept or reject the confession as a whole and cannot accept only the inculpatory element while rejecting the exculpatory element as inherently incredible.”</em><br/><strong><u>Thirdly:</u></strong> The condemned-prisoners had no intention to murder the deceased.<br/><strong><u>Fourthly</u></strong>: The Court below convicted the accused relying the confessions of co-accused which cannot be sustained in law<br/><strong><u>Fifthly:</u></strong> The Judgment and order of conviction and sentence based on misreading and non-consideration of the evidence on record which cannot be sustained in the eye of law.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In order to appreciate their submissions we have gone through the record and given our anxious consideration to their submissions.<br/>Let us now weigh and sift the evidence on record as adduced by the prosecution to prove the charge.<br/><br/>P.W.1, S.

The dead-bodies of deceaseds were found at the P.O. on 03-01-2005 in the morning. On the same day at 10:35 a.m. FIR was lodged by P.W.1. He (P.W.1) categorically stated that on 04-01-2005 he arrested accused Sujon from his in-law’s house. According to his confession he arrested accused Sohel on 05-01-2005 and seized one Audio Cassette player (Exhbt. 3(L) which was affixed to the micro-bus. He also stated that the deceaseds were identified by Advocate Bashir Ahmed Dulal (P.W.3) as his driver Babul and helper Ashab Ali of his micro-bus bearing no. Dhaka-metro N-12-1590 which was ultimately given to the jimma of P.W. 3. Later, accused Sohel was interrogated who informed to him that on 03-01-2005 at 5:30 p.m. accused Sujon and his accomplice Salam and Sylheti Kalam came to him to sale the stolen micro-bus. Later, with the help of accused Borhan and Afsar he managed to sale it to Suny Ahmed Sentu at the price of Tk.44,000/-. The stolen micro-bus was handed over to Suny in Sineboard area. Subsequently he arrested accused Sentu and at his showing the micro-bus was recovered from the house of Mofizuddin. Thereafter on 06-01-2005 the accused Sujon made confession (Exhbt.4), the contents of it is absolutely corroborative with the evidence of P.W.1 and such confession was recorded by P.W.12 after complying all legal formalities laid down in Section 364 of the Code. The accused Sujon deb did not complain regarding torture or coercion or allurement.  But at the later stage of trial accused Sujon deb raised a plea that by alluring him such confession was extracted.  The plea raised by him has no leg to stand and as such the defence having not deliberately led any evidence, in support of his pseudo plea, so it recoils against him. Moreover PWs. 2, 4-6, 8, 11, 17, 18, 19 were examined to corroborate the evidence of above witnesses. They categor-ically corroborated their evidence. However all the PWs. were extensively cross examined by the defence but nothing could be elucidated to shake their credibility in any manner whatso-ever. Therefore, such pseudo plea should be left out of consideration.<br/><br/>On critical analysis of the evidence on record along with the confession of accused Sujon deb we find that at the instance of Salam he ( Sujon deb) took over the seat of the driver of micro-bus and drived the car and at night he reached to his in-laws house wherein they took meal allowing time to reach Kalam to there. Thereafter they started to their destination. In view of such facts we hold that the confession of Sujon deb is true, voluntary and inculpatory voluntary in nature.<br/><br/>It further appears to us that above confessing accused implicated himself in commission of murdering. The materials on record shows that his confession was shown as voluntary and inculpatory in nature. So it is well established that confessional statement if found inculpatory in nature and also true and voluntary it can be used against its maker and conviction can solely be based on it without any further corroborative evidence. <br/><br/>In the instant case the confession made by accused Sujon deb (Exhbt.4) was not only inculpatory in nature, but also true and voluntary and as such the Tribunal very rightly based solely on the confession and correctly convicted and sentenced the above accused by the impugned judgment and order, having duly found him guilty for the offence committed under Sections 302, 34 of the Penal Code.<br/>In the case of Islam Uddin (Md.) alias Din Islam  Vs. The State 13 BLC (AD)81 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“It is now settled principle of law that <em>Judicial confession if it is found to be true and voluntary can form the sole basis of conviction as against the maker of the same. The High Court Division has rightly found the judicial confession of the condemned-prisoner true and voluntary and considering the same, the extra judicial confession and, circumstances of the case, found the condemned-prisoner guilty and accordingly imposed the sentence of death upon him. ”  </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Similar views were taken in the cases of Abdur Rashid and others Vs. The State 3 BLD 206, Amir Hossain Vs. The State 6 BLD (AD)193, Gouranga Chandra Paul Vs. The State 59 DLR 17, 29 DLR(SC)27, Shajahan Ali (Md.) alias Md. Shahjahan Vs. The State 59 DLR 396, Hazrat Ali  and others Vs. The State 44 DLR (AD) 51, The State Vs. Abul Kalam Azad and others 8 BLC 464. Therefore we hold that the Court below rightly convicted the condemned prisoner Sujon deb after considering the evidence on record.<br/><br/>The complicity of the accused Sujon deb was also corroborated by P.Ws. 8 and 19 who categorically stated that accused Sujon deb stated in their presence that he along with accused Salam and Kalam strangulated the deceaseds to death.<br/><br/>It is true that confessions of co-accused is not a substantive peace of evidence against other co-accused who did not confess but in this case it appears to us that soon-after the occurrence the accused Salam and Kalam remained absconding. After occurrence accused Sujon made confession on 06-01-2005 disclosing  the complicity of accused Salam and Kalam. So those accused had responsi-bilities to discharge their duties and explain their position towards the occurrence but they did not do so.<br/><br/>Abscondence of an accused is an incriminating circumstances connecting him in the offence and conduct of a person in abscondence after commission of crime is an evidence to show that he is concerned in the offence (Vide PLD 1965 Lah. 656). Therefore, anything, which tends to explain his conduct and furnishes a motive other than a guilty conscience, will be relevant under the Evidence Act. Failure to explain reason for absconding after occurrence favours prosecution (39 DLR 437). Abscondence of accused is a relevant fact. Unless accused explain his conduct, abscondence may indicate guilt of accused (33 DLR 274). Where accused absconded immediately after occurrence and remained out of reach of hand of law for more than years without showing any convincing reason for his absence, it would be an important factor going against absconder accused (AIR-1998 SC-107). Abscondence immediately after incident and trial in absentia and abscondence till today is a strong incriminating circumstances while can be considered sufficient corroboration of his participation in commission of crime (11 BLT 155).<br/><br/>Therefore, we hold that accused Salam and Kalam are squarely responsible for committing the murder of deceaseds with Sujon deb.<br/>The credit to be given to the statement of a witness is a matter not regulated by rule of procedure, but depends upon his knowledge of fact to which he testifies his disinterestedness, his integrity and his veracity. Apportion of oral evidence depends on such variable in consistence which as a human nature cannot be reduced as a set formula (40 DLR 58).<br/>The weight to be attached to the testimony of witness depends in a large measure upon various consideration some of which are in the face of it his evidence should be in consonance with probabilities and consistent with other evidence, and should generally so fit in with material details of the case for the prosecution as to carry conviction of truth to a prudent mind. In a word evidence of a witness is to be looked at from point of view of its credibility, it is quite unsafe to discard evidence of witness which otherwise appears reasonable and probable because of some suggestion against truthfulness of the witness.<br/>Evidence of close relations of the victim cannot be discarded more particularly when close relations does not impair the same. Straightforward evidence given by witness who is related to deceased cannot be rejected on sole ground that they are interested in prosecution. Ordinarily close relation will be last person to screen real culprit and falsely implicate a person. So relationship far from being ground of criticism is often a sure guarantee of its truth( 40 DLR 58).<br/>On appraisal of the evidence on record we find that P.W.1 arrested accused Sohel and seized record player of the stolen micro-bus from his house. The micro-bus was sold at the instance of Afsar Uddin and Borhanuddin to accused Sentu. Later, it was recovered from the house of Mafizuddin shown by Sentu. The accused Suhel, Borhanuddin, Afsar and Sentu were found responsible for keeping the stolen micro-bus in their possession and its selling.  Their confessions also indicate their complicity as to keeping and selling the micro-bus. Therefore, the offence against them under Section 411 was well proved.<br/>In view of such facts, the evidence regarding taking away, micro-bus, murdering the deceaseds and recovery of the micro-bus from the accused are consistent, uniform and corroborative with each other with all materials particulars. There is absolutely no reason to disbelieve the consistent and corroborative evidence of those competent witnesses having no reason whatsoever to dispose falsely against them. The defence extensively cross-examined them but nothing could be elucidated to shake their credibility in any manner whatsoever. So the same are invulnerable to the credibility. Therefore, we hold that the complicity of the accused in murdering the deceaseds and recovery of stolen micro-bus from their possession are well proved by convincing and unimpeachable evidence.<br/>Moreover, the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence in its entirety is well founded in the facts and circumstances of the case.  So the submissions advance by the learned Deputy Attorney General prevails and appears to have a good deals of force. On the contrary we failed to discover any merit in the submissions advanced by the learned Counsel for the defence.<br/><br/>In the light of discussions made above and the preponderant judicial views emerging out of the authorities referred to above, we are of the view that the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence suffers from no legal infirmities. However as to the sentence the learned Advocates for the condemned prisoners submits that there was no premediation for murder so the sentence of death should be committed. Regards being had to the facts and circumstances of the case we are of the view that the sentence of imprisonment for life will meet the ends of justice instead of death.<br/><br/>In the result:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(a) Death reference no. 63 of 2006 is rejected.  <br/>(b)  The impugned Judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 13-07-2006 passed by learned Judge of Tribunal, in Druto Bichar (Sessions) Case No. 15 of 2006 is hereby maintained with a modific-ation of sentence of condemned-prisoners to imprisonment for life instead of death under Sections 302,34 of the Penal Code and the same in respect of appellants Sohel Khan, and Borhanuddin is maintained.<br/>(b) Accordingly Criminal appeal no. 3341 of 2006 and Jail appeal no. 663 of 2006 are dismissed with a modification of sentence in the above terms.<br/>(c)  Criminal appeal no. 3462 of 2006 and 3630 of 2006 are dismissed. The convicts Sohel and Borhanuddin are directed to surrender to their respective bail bond within fifteen days from the date of receipt of this order to serve out the remaining part of sentence.<br/>d)   The learned Judge of the Court below will take appropriate step to secure the arrest of absconding condemned-prisoners Salam and Kalam and appellants Shohel Khan and Borhanuddin and commit them to jail to serve out their sentence.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The Office is directed to send down the records at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>
