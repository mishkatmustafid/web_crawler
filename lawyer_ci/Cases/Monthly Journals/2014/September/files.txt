The suit was subsequently re-numbered on transfer to the Court of Assistant Judge, 5th Court, Dhaka as Title Suit No. 23 of 1990. The case of the plaintiffs, in-short,  is that .0428 acres of land appertaining to C.S. Plot No. 174 under C.S. Khatian No. 16068 of Mouza-Sutrapur (Kotwali), Dhaka corresp-onding to  State Acquisition Khatian No.2339 , plot No.6221 was belonged to Oli Ullah, Mili Bibi, Chandi Bibi, Asmat Bibi and Lale Bibi.  Asmat Bibi and Lal Bibi had no son and they gifted their share to Oli Ullah and Mali Bibi and handed over possession to them.  Chandi Bibi died leaving behind Meli Bibi and Oli Ullah. Subsequently, the share of Meli Bibi was transferred to Oli Ullah and accordingly, Oli Ullah became the owner and possessor of the land under C.S. Plot No.174. The said Oli Ullah had a vacant cow shade on the east-south corner of the said plot as described in the Kha schedule of the plaint, who allowed one Ramij Uddin to sleep at night in the said cow shade out of sympathy. Later on, Oli Ullah renovated the cow shade for human living and the said Ramij Uddin was allowed to stay there as a permissive licensee with a condition that he will vacate the same, if necessary; that after the death of the said Ramij Uddin his son Alauddin was also allowed to stay there as a permissive licensee by the heirs of Oli Ullah out of sympathy; that Oli Ullah died leaving behind plaintiff Nos. 1 and 2 and Nashiruddin, wife, Pari Banu (plaintiff No.4) and one daughter Kalu Bibi.  After the death of Alauddin his son Zakir Hossain also took permission to reside there as licenses and in spite of objection raised by the plaintiffs on 5.5. 1987 the defendant-Zakir Hossain illegally constructed a building thereon. The defendant has no right, title and interest in the Kha schedule land of the plaint and hence, the suit.<br/><br/>The sole defendant-petitioner entered appearance in the suit and filed written statement denying most of the allegations of the plaint contending, inter-alia, that predecessor of the defendant Moksed Ali and his sister Raju Bibi got the pucca building on C.S plot No. 173 and ½ of the Bhiti and land of C.S. plot  No 175 by way of inheritance.  Moksed Ali died leaving 6 sons Rahimuddin, Ramijuddin and others and 1 daughter; that there was a small passage and katcha latirne on the southern portion of plot No. 174 for the inhabitants of C.S. plot No 173. Ramijuddin was given to possess the land of C.S. plot No. 173 by his other brothers, who (Ramijuddin) died leaving behind 7 sons Alauddin and others and one daughter. The heirs of Ramijuddin used to reside on the land of C.S. plot No. 173 except Alauddin, Municipality holding No. 33/1 was opened in the name of Ramijuddin for katcha house on C.S. plot No. 175,  Alauddin constructed a 2 storied house there and died leaving one son (defendant)  and 2 daughters and wife, who are residing there paying rent and taxes to the Government regularly.  The defendant for his business purpose converted his residence into workshop and a betel-nut shop and has been possessing the 'kha' schedule land through tenant. The 'kha' schedule land does not attract with the land of C.S. plot No.174 and as such, the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>At the trial both the parties led evidence to prove their respective cases.<br/>The learned Assistant Judge on consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case and evidence on record dismissed the suit by his judgment and decree dated 28.3.1992 holding that the plaintiffs  having failed to prove that the defendant  has been possessing the suit land as a permissive  licensee.<br/>Unsuccessful plaintiffs, thereafter, preferred Title Appeal No.161 of 1992 in the Court of District Judge, Dhaka. Eventually, the said appeal was transmitted to the Court of Subordinate Judge, Commercial Court No.2, Dhaka who by judgment and decree dated 25.09.2997 dismissed the appeal and affirmed the judgment of the trial Court dismissing the suit.<br/><br/>Against which the plaintiff-petitioners preferred Civil Revision No.626 of 1998 to this Court.  Ultimately, a single bench of this Court by judgment and order dated 7.7.2009 remanded the case to the Court of appeal below after setting-aside the judgment and decree dated 25.9.1997 passed by the then Subordinate Judge, Commercial Court No.2, Dhaka with a direction to consider the report of the Advocate Commissioner regarding position of the suit property as well as evidence and materials on record.<br/><br/>In this backdrop   the Court of appeal below again on perusal of the evidence and materials record and upon hearing both the parties by the impugned judgment and decree dated 29.3.2010 (decree signed on 4.4.2010) dismissed the appeal and affirmed the judgment and decree of the trial Court dated 28.3.1992 holding that the plaintiffs could not prove their case by adducing evidence that the defendant has been possessing the land in question as   licensee under them.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and decree dated 29.3.2010 the present plaintiff-petitioners moved this Court and obtained the present Rule.<br/><br/>Mr. Sk. Md. Morshed, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioners after placing the judgments of both the Courts below and other materials on record including the evidences of PWs and DWs submits that both the Courts below having failed to consider that the plaintiff-petitioner filed the suit for ejectment of the defendant licensee from the 'Kha' schedule property of  the plaint i.e. C.S. Plot No.174 and recovery of khas possession and in the said suit the defendant-opposite party neither in  their written statement nor in their oral evidence claimed any right, title or adverse possession over the 'Kha' schedule land. Mr. Morshed in the course of his argument upon referring the judgments of both the Courts below argues that both the Courts below on assessment of the evidences on record found that the plaintiff-petitioners during trail exhibited a series of documents to prove that their predecessor was the owner of C.S. Plot No.174 but both the Courts below without assigning any sound reason whatsoever arrived at a finding that the plaintiff could not or did not prove his case beyond doubt. He further submits that judgments of both the Courts below are perverse being contrary to law and materials on record inasmuch as the defendant-opposite party  in their written statement specifically stated that their right, title and interest is not related in any way  with 'Kha' schedule land of the plaint and none of the DWs. in their respective deposition claimed any right, title and interest over the 'Kha' schedule land but the Courts below ignoring these aspects of the case including vital exhibits namely, C.S. Khatian (Ext.1), S. A. Khatian (Ext.1 (Ka), R.S. Khatian (Ext.X), rent receipt (Ext.2) and Municipality tax receipt (Ext.3) abruptly arrived at a finding that the plaintiffs have  failed to prove their case.<br/><br/>Drawing my attention to the judgment of this Court dated 7.7.2009 passed in Civil Revision No.626 of 1998 Mr. Morshed submits that the case was remanded by this Court to the Court of appeal below with a specific direction to consider the report of the Advocate Commissioner regarding position  of the suit property but the learned  judge of the lower appellate Court without applying its judicial mind into the facts and circumstance of the case as well as direction of this Court most illegally without considering the Advocate Commissioner's report by the impugned judgment  mechanically dismissed the appeal in a summary manner which resulted in the failure of justice.<br/><br/>Mr. Morshed,  further upon placing the Advocate Commissioner’s report submits that in the facts and circumstance of the case the Court of appeal below ought to have considered the Advocate Commissioner report to arrive at a correct decision and in not doing so, the Court of appeal below seriously erred in law in passing the impugned judgment  without properly applying his judicial mind into the facts and circumstances of the case and the same has resulted in an error in the impugned decision occasioning failure of justice. Mr. Morshed,  finally submits that findings of the Court of appeal below so far it relates to adverse possession of the defendant-opposite party  are  not only misconceived also contrary to the material evidence on record inasmuch as there is  nothing on record to suggest that the defendant-opposite party  having claimed their right, title and interest over the 'Kha' schedule land by way of adverse possession and as such, at any rate  the impugned judgments of both the Courts below are liable to be set-aside.<br/><br/>No one entered appearance to contest the Rule.<br/>I have heard the learned Advocate for the petitioners at length and perused the materials on record including the judgments of both the Courts below and the deposition of PWs. and DWs. The main point for consid-eration is, as already noticed, whether the Courts below committed wrong in holding that the plaintiffs having failed to prove their case that the predecessors of the sole defendant as well as the defendant were allowed by the plaintiffs to possess their ‘kha’ schedule land as a permissive licensee.<br/>In deciding this point, I feel it necessary to quote hereunder paragraph No.1 of the plaint which reads as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"অত্র আদালতের এলাকাধীন জেলা ঢাকার কোতয়ালী হালে সুত্রাপুর থানাধীন ১৬০৬৮ নং সি, এস, খতিয়ানভুও্র ১৭৪ নং দাগে কাঁচা বাড়ী মোট ০৪২৮ অজুতাংশ যাহার এস, এ, খতিয়ান নং- ২২৩৯, দাগ নং-৬২২৫ ভুও্র সম্পত্তির অলিউল্যা। ১০ গন্ডা মেলা বিবি চাদী বিবি আছমত বিবি ও লালে বিবি গন্ডা অংশে মালিক দখলকার স্বত্ববান নিয়ত হইয়া ও থাকিয়া ভোগদখল করিতে থাকেন এবং বিগত সি,এস, জরীপে তাহাদের নাম ও অংশ শুদ্ধভাবে রেকর্ড ভুক্ত হয়"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From a plain reading of the above quoted paragraph No.1 of the plaint together with the prayer portion as well as schedule 'Kha' of the plaint, it demonstrates that the petitioners as plaintiffs instituted a suit being Title Suit No.88 of 1987 in the Court of  Assistant Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka against the sole defendant-opposite party praying for ejectment of licensee  from the suit property as described in 'Kha' schedule of the plaint i.e. .0428 acres of land appertaining to C.S.  khatian No. 16068, C.S. Dag No. 174  under  Mouza-Sutrapur, Kotwali, Dhaka.<br/><br/>Let me now advert to the evidence of PWs and the DWs.<br/><br/>PW-1, Md. Ashim Uddin in his deposition stated that: নালিশী জমি সি,এস, ১৭৪ দাগ এর মোট জমির পরিমান ৪২৮ অজুতাংশ। এই সম্পত্তির মুল মালিক ছিলেন আমার বাবা। উও্র সি,এস, রেকর্ড দাখিল করিলাম প্রদর্শনী-১ এস,এ খতিয়ান আমাদের নামে প্রস্তুত হয়। প্রদর্শনী ১ক নালিশী ভুমির আর,এস, রেকর্ড দাখিল করিলাম।  PW-2, Md. Nazimuddin and PW-3, Md. Zamal, both these witnesses in their respective deposition corroborated the evidence of PW-1 in respect of all material particulars.<br/><br/>DW-1, Md. Zakir Hossain as sole defendant of the  suit stated in his deposition that, .........আমাদের বাড়ীর জমি এবং বাদীর জমি পৃথক।...............আমাদের ১৭৫ দাগে বাদীদের অংশ নহে। This witness in his cross-examination stated that ১৭৪ দাগের পূর্ব দিকে নালিশী বাড়ী। আমরা ১৭৫ দাগের .০০২৫ অযুতাংশে র মালিক। ১৭৫ দাগে আমার দাদার নামে রেকর্ড আছেz DW-2, Md. Selim in his deposition stated that he is a tenant of defendant  being  holding No. 33/1. This witness in his deposition stated nothing with regard to property under C.S. Khatian No. 16068 and Dag No. 174.<br/><br/>The present opposite party as sole defendant in his written statement clearly stated that বাদীর দাবীকৃত "খ" তপসিল বর্ণিত সম্পওির সহিত বিবাদীর স্বত্ব দখলীয় সম্পত্তির কোন সম্পর্ক নাই। এই বিবাদীকে অযথা হয়রানী করার জন্য অত্র মিথ্যা মামলা দায়ের করিয়াছে।<br/><br/>From the above quoted evidence together with the material portion of the written objection, it transpires that the defendant-opposite party  did not at all claim the property in question as described in the  “kha” schedule  of the plaint i.e. C.S. Khatian No. 16068 and Dag No.174. My, view is, therefore, that both the Courts below after detailed discussion of the entire materials on record rightly arrived at a concurrent finding that the plaintiff-petitioners having failed to prove that the defendant-opposite party has been possessing the suit property as licensee under plaintiff-petitioners.<br/><br/>On query from the Court, Mr. Morshed, the learned Advocate expressed his inability to show any scarp of paper to prove that the predecessors of the sole defendant or defendant-opposite party were/was licensee of the plaintiff-petitioners. Therefore, in the facts and circumstance of the case, I am led to hold that both the Courts below committed no illegality in holding that the plaintiff-petitioners could not prove their case beyond doubt.<br/><br/>Now, it remains for me to consider the main argument of Mr. Morshed that the Court of appeal below in the facts and circumstance of the case without considering the Advocate Commissioner's report committed gross illegality in dismissing the appeal. As I have already noticed that this Court earlier by its judgment and order dated 7.7.2009 passed in Civil Revision No. 626 of 1998 remanded   the case to the Court of appeal below with a direction to consider the Advocate Commissioner report regarding the position of the suit property as well as evidence namely oral and documentary evidence of both the sides.<br/><br/>The trial Court below on assessment of the evidence on record arrived at a finding that:- এ-প্রসংগে বাদীপক্ষের ১ নং সাক্ষী স্বয়ং ১ নং বাদী তাহার জেরাতে উল্লেখ করেন যে, নালিশী সহানে এই বিবাদী ১০/১২ বৎসর পূর্বে  দোতলা ভবন নির্মান করেন এবং রাস্তা চালু হবার সময় ভবনের কিয়দংশ ভাংগা হয়। সুতরাং স্বীকৃতায় বহু পূর্বেই বিবাদী নালিশী সহানে দোতলা ভবন নির্মান করেন। বিবাদীর প্রদর্শনীকৃত কাগজাদিতে দেখা যায় যে, পৃথক ভাবে এই বিবাদী বিভিন্ন সংযোগাদী  গ্রহন পূর্বক দীর্ঘদিন যাবত নালিশী হোল্ডিংয়ে বসবাস রত আছেন। উপরন্তু প্রদর্শনী- ৪ যাহা এডভোকেট কমিশনারের তদন্ত প্রতিবেদন তাহাতে নালিশী দাগের সহিত ১৭৫ সি, এস, দাগ সংযুও্র এবং একত্রে দেখানো হইয়াছে। উপরোক্ত অবসহাধীনে সহজেই প্রতীয়মান হয় যে, এই বাদীগন নালিশী সম্পত্তিতে বিবাদীকে অনুমতি প্রাপ্ত হিসাবে প্রমানে সমর্থ হন নাই।<br/><br/>From the above, it appears that the trial Court below on due consideration of the entire materials on record including the Advocate Commissioner’s report arrived at a finding that the plaintiff could not prove their  case that the defendant-opposite party has been possessing the suit land as  licensee under the plaintiff-petitioner.<br/><br/>The Court of appeal below in its turn by the impugned judgment  affirmed the judgment of the trial Court below with the following observation  that: বাদীর দাবী প্রতিপুর্রষ অন্তর অন্তর বিবাদীগন লাইসেন্স এর বিষয়টি নবায়ন করে নালিশী ভূমিতে দখল পরিচালনা করে আসছে। প্রাথমিক বিবেচনায় ঢাকা শহরে একখন্ড জমিতে কোন ব্যক্তি ৩ পুর্রষ ধরে অন্য একটি পরিবারকে বসবাসের জন্য অনুমতি প্রদান করে যাবেন- এটি বিশ্বাসযোগ্য নয়। সাক্ষ্য পর্য্যালোচনায় দেখা যায় এধরনের লাইসেন্স দেয়ার  সমর্থনে বাদীপক্ষ গ্রহন যোগ্য কোন সাক্ষ্য আদালতে উপস্থাপন করেননি।<br/><br/>It is true in passing the impugned judgment the Court of appeal did not discuss clearly about the Advocate Commissioner's report. But from the materials on record it appears it appears that the materials on record justify the order. It is now well settled that omission to assign reasons in the impugned order is not fatal, if in law the order is sustainable. So it is a mere irregularity not an illegality and the impugned judgment cannot be knocked down on that count. Therefore, I am not inclined to disturb with the impugned judgment and decree.<br/><br/>Law is well settled that the burden lies on the plaintiff to prove his case and he must succeed on his own strength only not at the weakness of defendant. In the present case, I have already indicated that  defendant-opposite party neither  in their written statement nor in their evidence claimed  any ownership or right, title and interest in the land  of “kha” schedule  property of the plaint (C.S. Khatian No. 16068 and Dag No.174) and on the other hand, the plaintiff-petitioners also could not or did not prove that the defendant-opposite party has been possessing the land in question as  licensee successively under them by adducing any reliable or documentary evidence. So, I find no substance in either of the contentions as raised by the learned Advocate for the petitioners.<br/><br/>On an overall consideration of the facts, circumstances and the materials on record, I find nothing on record to suggest that the defendant has been possessing the suit land as licensee of the plaintiff-petitioners. There is practically no evidence, either documentary or circumstantial that the defendant-opposite party has been possessing the land in question as licensee. It appears that the learned Judge of the trial has exhaustively dealt with the questions raised before it and quite correctly found the plaintiffs could not prove their claim. Therefore, I do not find any possible reason to differ with the view taken by both the Courts below that the plaintiff-petitioners having failed to prove their case beyond doubt.<br/><br/>Here it may further be mentioned that the cases relied upon by the petitioners have also no manner of application in the facts and circumstance of the case as the facts of the instant case are quite distinguishable from the facts of those cases.<br/><br/>In the result, the Rule is discharged without any order as to costs. The order of status-quo granted earlier by this Court stands vacated.<br/><br/>Let a copy of the judgment along with the lower Court's record be sent down at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

In course of his service career the writ petitioner was promoted to the post of Assistant Manager (Administration) of BFIDC. While serving as such, the petitioner was supplied with a gradation list under memo dated 12.12.1984 about the officers of BFIDC in the post of Assistant Administrative Officer in which his name was shown at serial No. 24 and his date of birth as 31.10.1949. On receipt of the gradation list, the petitioner got confused about his correct date of birth. Meanwhile, he lost his original Secondary School Certificate. As such, he could not take any step to correct his date of birth although his date of birth was shown as 31<sup>st</sup> October, 1947 AD in one part of the service book. The petitioner also found that the figure “9” occurring in the figure ‘1949’ was disfigured and converted into figure ‘7’. In view of the anomaly in the service book the petitioner thought it necessary to obtain a duplicate Secondary School Examination Certificate. He took all necessary steps for the purpose. Eventually the petitioner succeeded in obtaining a duplicate certificate of the result of his Secondary School Certificate Examination. Having gone through the duplicate certificate, the petitioner found that his date of birth is 31.10.1949 and not 31.10.1947.<br/><br/>Such being the state of affairs, the petitioner submitted an application on 7.8.2003 to respondent No. 3 for correction of his date of birth in his service book according to the date available in duplicate Secondary School Certificate. But the application was rejected and the decision was communicated to him by a letter dated 17.11.2003.<br/><br/>Challenging the decision dated 17.11.2003 refusing to correct his date of birth as per the duplicate Secondary School Certificate the writ petitioner filed the Writ Petition and obtained the Rule Nisi.<br/><br/>Respondent Nos.2 to 5 filed a joint affidavit-in-opposition controverting the material statements made in the writ petition. Their case, in short is that in filling up the column No 5 of page 3 of his service book, part-1 the petitioner, without any little scratch/ overwriting, wrote his date of birth as on “Thirty first October Nineteen hundred and forty seven A.D” in words. In column 1 and 4 of the same page of the service book-1 he wrote his name as “Md. Hatem Ali, S/o Mvi. Nazimuddin Mia” respectively. Similarly, he filled in the column 1, 2 and 5 of page 3 part 2 of the service book as Md. Hatem Ali, S/o late Nazimuddin and his date of birth as on 31.10.1947 respectively. Subsequently, someone overwrote ‘9’ over the figure 7 and the overwriting is conspicuous with bare-eyes. Therefore, this Rule should be discharged.<br/><br/>After hearing both the parties, the High Court Division made the Rule absolute without any order as to costs and directed the respondents to take all necessary steps for correction of the date of birth and the name of the writ-petitioner including the name of his father in his service book according to the S.S.C. certificate produced by him before the concerned authority.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 06.02.2006 passed by the High Court Division, writ-respondent Nos.2 and 3 filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.590 of 2006 in which leave was on 05.11.2007. As a result, Civil Appeal No.223 of 2007 has been initiated.<br/><br/>Mr. Chowdhury Sanawar Ali, learned Advocate has appeared with the leave of the Court for writ respondent Nos.2 and 3 submits that the dispute as regards the date of birth of the writ petitioner cannot be resolved without taking evidence and as such, the Writ Petition filed by the writ petitioner was misconceived. He further submits that the High Court Division failed to take into consideration that the writ petitioner himself recorded his name as Hatem Ali and his date of birth as 31.10.1947 in the service book and that the duplicate certificate produced before the authority by the petitioner reveals that his  name is Hatem Ali Fakir son of Nazimuddin Fakir and that his date of birth is 31.10.1949 and that without taking into consideration those admitted facts the High Court Division made the Rule absolute and as such the impugned judgment and order should be set aside.<br/><br/>Mr. Chowdhury Md. Jahangir, learned Advocate-on-Record for the writ petitioner, on the other hand, submits that the High Court Division on consideration of materials on record came to a definite finding that the date of birth of the petitioner is 31.10.1949 and as such no interference is called for.<br/><br/>We have considered the impugned judgment, the submissions of the learned Advocates and other papers on record. Admittedly, the petitioner joined Khulna Complex of BFIDC on 1.5.1969 as Assistant Supervisor. Later, he was promoted to the post of Assistant Manager (Administration). While in service, the petitioner was supplied with a gradation list dated 12.12.1984 in respect of the officers of BFIDC in the post of Assistant Administrative Officer in which his name was shown at serial No. 24 and his date of birth as 31.10.1947. Meanwhile, he lost his Secondary School Certificate and as such he could not take any step to correct his date of birth recorded as 31.10.1947 in the service book. The petitioner also detected that the figure “9” in figure 1949 was interpolated and converted into “7” in the service book. The petitioner obtained a duplicate Secondary School Certificate and became sure that his actual date of birth, in fact, is 31.10.1949 and not 31.10.1947. After that, the petitioner submitted an application for correction of his date of birth before respondent No. 3 on 17.8.2003 according to the duplicate Secondary School Certificate. The authority received that application for correction but ultimately rejected the same by a decision communicated to him, vide letter dated 17.11.2003 (Annexure-H).<br/><br/>Challenging the above decision of the authority, the petitioner obtained the Rule Nisi from the High Court Division which made the Rule absolute and declared Annexure-‘H’ to the Writ Petition to have been issued without lawful authority. The salient findings of the High Court Division are as follows:<br/><br/>          The prayer of the petitioner for correction was refused on the ground of delay of 30 years and no other reason was assigned in the impugned order rejecting the prayer of the petitioner. The authority made a correction in respect of the name of one Md. K.M. Sayed after about 30 years and the date of birth of respondent No.5 was corrected as per Secondary School Certificate after 32 years. The reason assigned in the impugned order refusing his prayer was capricious, arbitrary and without any application of mind. The petitioner obtained a duplicate Secondary School Certificate as the original was lost and in this process he had to spend enough time collecting the same. The word “Fakir” in his name as well as in his father’s name had rather complicated the case of the petitioner and in such a position, the word ‘Fakir’ should not have been used after both the names to avoid such complication in the certificate, had it been a fake one. The existence of the word ‘Fakir’ in the name of the petitioner and also in the name of his father in the certificate proved its genuineness.<br/><br/>Leave was granted to consider the submission of the learned Advocate whether the High Court Division failed to take into consideration that the writ petitioner himself showed his date of birth as 31.10.1947 and the duplicate certificate produced before the authority by the writ-petitioner was in the name of Md. Hatem Ali Fakir son of Nazimuddin Fakir and his date of birth was 31.10.1949 and as such the High Court Division without considering this aspect of the case made the Rule absolute illegally.<br/><br/> The memo No. শিউক/সদ/পাঃ /প্রশিঃ /৮ (১) / ২০০৩/১৩৮৯ (৪৫)- dated 31.12.2003 Annexure-‘I’ to the Writ Petition reveals that the Secretary, BFIDC (respondent No. 3) asked all the officials   serving under BFIDC to supply their academic certificates with a view to rectifying errors, if any, in their service books in respect of their name as well as the date of birth. Pursuant to that memo many employees of BFIDC made applications for correction. It appears from the judgment that correction of name was made in respect of an employee, namely, Md. K. M. Sayed after about 30 years. The High Court Division also noticed that the date of birth of respondent No. 5 was corrected even after about 32 years. The writ-petitioner being the employee of BFIDC was discriminated against the other employees whose name and date of birth were corrected after a long lapse of time. Such invidious discrimination in respect of the writ petitioner is not permissible in view of articles 27 and 29 of the Constitution.<br/><br/>Sir Ivor Jennings in his “The Law and the Constitution”, Fifth Edition, at page-50 stated:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Equality before law means that among   equals, the law should be equal and should be equally administered, that like should be treated alike”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In this connection, reliance may be made on the case of Aluminium Corporation of India Ltd. Vs. Union of India and others AIR 1975 (SC) 2279 wherein it has been held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“All who are equal are equal in the eye of law, meaning thereby that it will not accord favoured treatment to persons within the same class”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the service book, it has been stated in no uncertain terms that the petitioner passed the S.S.C. examination in 1965 from Areal Swarnamoyee High School, Tongibari, Munshigonj under the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Dhaka and was placed in the 3<sup>rd</sup> Division. Therefore, the word ‘Fakir’ occurring in the name of the writ-petitioner and also in the name of his father in the duplicate Secondary School Certificate cannot belie the genuineness of the duplicate certificate as the other entries made therein are found to be correct. In the duplication Secondary School Certificate, the date of birth of the writ-petitioner has been written as “Thirty-first October Nineteen hundred and forty nine.” Records reveal that the writ petitioner obtained the duplicate certificate after observing all formalities. Writ-respondent Nos.2 to 5 could not prove that the duplicate Secondary School Certificate was a forged one. Another important aspect is that the service book of an officer is kept with the authority and not with the employee. Therefore, the writ-petitioner cannot be held responsible for any interpolation in his service book.<br/><br/>In the light of the findings made before, we do not find any ground to interfere with the decision of the High Court Division.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. There is no order as to costs.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

But this court finds that Section 57 of the Act, empowers the Artha Rin Adalat to give adequate relief in cases as in hand, even if it is assumed but not conceded that there is no scope to give the petitioner appropriate relief by the Artha Rin Adalat under the other provision of the Act. Furthermore, in view of the facts and circumstance of this case, the High Court Division is competent enough to give such relief in exercise of its powers under Article 102 of the Constitution as is necessary to safeguard the petitioner’s fundamental right to property under Article 42 of the constitution. . . .(21)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Artha Rin Adalat Ain (VIII of 2003)</strong><br/><strong>Section 44(2)</strong><br/><strong>The impugned orders passed by the court are interlocutory and not final orders and thus no appeal/revision can be taken there from as per provision of Section 44(2) of the Act and, therefore, the present writ is maintainable. . . .(22)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Artha Rin Adalat Ain (VIII of 2003)</strong><br/><strong>Section 57</strong><br/><strong>Since the auction has not yet been confirmed </strong><strong>by the executing court and since the mortgaged</strong><strong> property is the only homestead of the petitioner as claimed by the petitioner, for protecting the homestead of the petitioner in our considered view, it was a fit case to exercise the powers under Section 57 of the Ain to give adequate relief to the petitioner, but which the Artha Rin Adalat failed to exercise under said section. In these circumstances we are inclined to dispose of this Rule with the direction to the petitioner judgment debtor to pay 10% above the bid money to the auction purchaser and the balance decretal amount along with the other costs to the bank decree holder within 30 days of the receipt of the certified copy of this judgment and order, failing which the auction sale shall stand absolute. . . .(23)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Artha Rin Adalat Ain (VIII of 2003)</strong><br/><strong>Section 22, 33 (5) (7), 38, 45, 49 and 57</strong><br/><strong>Precious opportunities are readily passed over under the Act to mitigate that statute’s obvious harshness as operates against judgment-debtors. This stems, this Court finds, from an ingrained inability to appreciate that the core objective of the Act at debt recovery must not invariably without further qualification entail the acquisition of a defaulter/judgment-debtor’s property. On the contrary there is nothing in the Act that </strong><strong>dictates the inevitability of such consequence.</strong><strong> Rather, the Act aims expressly to achieve the opposite. Provisions, most notably, in Sections 22, 38, 45, 49 and 57, emphatically attest to that statutory intent. But undue conservatism per se or misconceived reservations either to explore avenues of equitable alternative amicable settlement processes endorsed by the Act itself or to exercise its </strong><strong>inherent jurisdiction, for reasons not entirely</strong><strong> evident to this Court, operate regrettably to bind the Adalat’s hand as it were. In that context, the Adalat has instead grown so complacently used to a selective and preferential reliance of certain provisions of the Act, that the said Act, particularly through over-subscription to the provisions </strong><strong>of Sections 33(5) and 33(7), is inappropriately</strong> <strong>seen as pandering to the acquisitive tendencies</strong><strong> of decree-holder banks and financial institutions rather than to facilitating the full recovery of their loans.  There is seen, </strong><strong>therefore, a failure by the Adalat to strike an</strong><strong> essential balance between financial interests of financial institutions and the fundamental proprietary interests of judgment-debtors </strong><strong>that clearly is the Act’s objective and purpose.</strong><strong> Such abdication of statutory authority and jurisdiction by the Adalat as a matter of course has led to the above-referred provisions being relegated by disuse to the unavoidable status as dead letters of the law in stark discordance with clear legislative intent to the contrary. This Court is of the view, therefore, that such a </strong><strong>situation needs to be addressed and redressed</strong><strong> urgently. It is with that intent that this Judgment and Order is particularly being communicated </strong><strong>to the concerned Artha Rin Adalat. . . .(29)</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/><strong>Mr. Awsafur Rahman, Advocate with<br/>Mr. M.G.

The said Artha Rin suit was heard ex parte in the absence of the petitioner and the respondent No.1, Court decreed the suit ex parte in favour of the respondent No. 2 Bank by its judgment and decree dated 12.5.2009 and by the said decree the petitioner was directed to make payment of the decretal amount to the Bank  within 40 days from the date of the order. The petitioner having failed to repay the same, the respondent No.2 Bank put the said decree into execution by filing Artha Rin Execution Case No. 1 of 2010 in the Court of Artha Rin Adalat, Faridpur on 4.2.2010. The petitioner on coming to know about the filing of the Execution case filed an application on 29.9.2010 seeking time to pay the Bank’s dues stating that the petitioner earlier paid Tk.50,000/-before the Artha Rin Adalat which was fixed for hearing amongst other dates and finally on 20.6.2011. But on the date fixed the said application was rejected by the court refusing time to the petitioner to make payment of the outstanding dues to the bank.  Thereafter the petitioner again deposited Tk.50,000/- with the respondent No.2 Bank towards repayment of the loan  on 26.9.2011 and filed an application before the Artha Rin Adalat praying for three months time  to pay the rest of the amount. On the following date on 27.9.20112 the petitioner filed another application before the executing Court praying for stay of the auction process and also to be granted time for repayment of the loan. The Artha Rin Adalat after hearing the application mentioned above rejected the same by its order dated 3.10.2011 observing that the petitioner is unnecessarily delaying the disposal of the execution case and proceeded to hold the auction on 3.10.2011. Subsequently, the Artha Rin Adalat accepted the auction bid   of one Khaja Abdus Sattar in rejecting the prayer of the petitioner. The Petitioner contends that by this time the petitioner by various installments in total deposited Tk. 1,15,000/- with the respondent No. 2, Bank. At this stage the petitioner moved this court by filing this appli-cation under Article 102 of the Constitution of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh and obtained the present rule and stay. Further case of the petitioner is that after acceptance of the auction bid the petitioner filed an application  before the Artha Rin Adalat  under Order 21, Rule 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure (“Code”) on 16.11.2011 by depositing  5% of the bid money for payment to the auction purchaser praying for allowing the petitioner to get the mortgaged property released/redeemed upon payment to the bank the outstanding dues. But the court fixed on 20.11.2011 for hearing the application allowing time to the decree holder to file written objection. On 20.11.2011 the petition was heard and upon hearing the Artha Rin Adalat rejected the same, not on merit but only observing that since the matter is pending before the High Court Division the petition is not at all considerable at this stage. Thereafter the petitioner filed another application on 04.1.2012 under Order 21, Rule 89 of the Code praying for setting aside the auction sale. The said petition was heard on 5.1.2012 and after hearing, the court rejected the same as the proceeding has been stayed by the High Court Division in this instant application.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the respondent No.2 Bank and auction purchaser as added respondent No.3 contested the rule by filing separate affidavits-in-opposition. The case of the respondent No.2 Bank, in short, is that the petitioner was granted a loan of Tk. 2,00,000/- on 11.8.2002 and against the loan the petitioner executed relevant charge documents, promissory note and created mortgage of his landed property as security  by a deed of mortgage No. 5026 and also executed  a power of  attorney on 4.8.2002 authorizing the Bank  to sell the mortgaged property. The petitioner, however, failed to pay the outstanding dues within the stipulated time inspite of repeated demands and reminders of the Bank. The Bank finding no alternative was compelled to sell the property under Section 12 of the Artha Rin Ain, 2003 (“Act”) and published tender notice in “The Daily Jugantor” on 19.8.2005. But no bidder participated in the tender. As a result” the Bank filed the Artha Rin Suit No. 13 of 2007 before the Artha Rin Adalat, Faridpur. The Artha Rin Adalat decreed the suit against the petitioner on 18.5.2009. The petitioner having failed to repay the total amount as per decree passed by the Adalat, the respondent Bank put the decree into execution by filing Execution Case No. 1 of 2010 in the Artha Rin Adalat. In the process of execution the mortgaged property was put into auction by the court  and in the auction  sale, the intended buyers  submitted “Sealed quotation “ and amongst the bidders the bid of respondent No.3 become highest and upon compliance of relevant provision of law the respondent No.3’s bid was accepted by the Adalat. Thereafter entire bid money has been deposited by the respondent No.3 to the Court and as such there has been no irregularity and illegality in holding auction of the mortgaged property. Hence, the Respondent’s submit, the present rule is liable to be discharged.<br/><br/>The added respondent No.3, auction purchaser’s case, in short, is that the respondent no. 3 is a lawful purchaser of the mortgaged property in auction and he has paid the entire bid money and as such has acquired the lawful right in the purchased property. The respondent no. 3 affirms that he has participated in the auction and has become the highest bidder. The court accepted his bid by its order dated 09.10.2011. Submitting that there is no illegality in the impugned order passed by the court, the respondent No. 3 stresses that the petitioner had remedy against the auction held under Rules 89 and 90 of Order 21 of the Code but he having failed to avail the same this petition is not tenable in law and the Rule is liable to be discharged.<br/><br/>Mr. Awsafur Rahman, the learned advocate appearing for the petitioner submits that on 26.09.2011 the date fixed for holding auction, the petitioner appeared in court and filed  an application praying 3 months’ time to pay the bank’s dues stating that he has paid 50,000/- to the bank out of the decretal amount. The said application was kept in file and the court fixed 03.10.2011 for hearing and order. On the following day the petitioner again filed an application praying for time to pay the decretal amount and staying execution proce-edings stating the situation and expressing his willingness to liquidate the bank’s outstanding dues. The court kept the same in record and fixed 03.10.2011 for hearing the same and upon hearing rejected the same stating that the petitioner with an intention to cause delay in disposing the case filed the application. By its order dated 03.10.2011 the Court fixed date on 09.10.2011 for hearing the decree holder bank giving it an opportunity to raise objections, if any, regarding auction and for order. On that date the petitioner filed an application praying stay of the execution proceedings which was rejected by the Court on the ground that a similar application filed by the petitioner had already been rejected on 03.10.2011. Conseq-uentially, the Court accepted the bid of the respondent no. 3 auction purchaser given that his bid was found to be the highest and directed the respondent no. 3 to pay the balance bid money by 20.10.2011.<br/><br/> It is also argued that the decree was passed ex parte and the petitioner had no knowledge about filing of the suit but he only came to know when auction notice was published in the daily news paper. It is also submitted that the petitioner availed loan of TK. 2,00,000/- out of which the petitioner paid TK. 1,15,000/- to the bank on different dates. Had the court allowed time to the petitioner, the petitioner would have been able to make payment of the balance amount to the bank and as such the impugned orders are bad in law. He further submits that the property in question is the homestead of the petitioner and the petitioner will be homeless if the property is sold by the bank. It is noted that in addition to the applications of 16.11.2011 and 4.1.2012, the petitioner filed an application on 13.02.2012 seeking a direction upon the bank to accept the balance decretal amount from the petitioner. Upon hearing the court rejected the said application as the Execution proceedings has been stayed by this Court. Mr. Rahman, therefore, referring to the various applications and orders of the Artha Rin Adalat annexed to the petition, supplementary affidavit and affidavit-in-opposition submits that the petitioner from the date of auction onwards approached the court in various ways to get the property released upon payment of the balance outstanding dues to bank. Referring to the provisions of Sections 38,45,49 and 57 of the Act and Order 21, Rule 89 of the Code he further argued that the court had ample scope to consider the prayer and approach of the petitioner under Sections 38 and 45 of the Act, by referring the matter to the parties for compromise, or by allowing the petitioner to make instalment payments under Section 49 of the Act, or under Section 57 of the Act by directing the bank to accept the balance amount from the petitioner. Indeed, the court could have also proceeded under Order 21, Rule 89 the Code by setting aside the sale upon acceptance of 5% interest above the bid money. He also submits that though the bid has been accepted by the court, sale has not yet been confirmed and the bid money not withdrawn by the bank and as such the execution proceedings is still pending. Under these circumstances, it is argued, the dispute can still be settled under Sections 38 and 45 of the Act or by passing an appropriate order for ends of justice under Section 57 of the Act. But the court below without appreciating all these avenues and ignoring the provisions of law most illegally rejected the applications of the petitioner and accepted the bid of the added respondent no. 3. In support of his submissions Mr. Rahman referred to the judgment of Abdul Momen Bhuiyan and others -versus- District Judge, Dhaka and others dated 17.11.2013 passed by the Appellate Division in Civil petition for leave to Appeal No. 2228 of 2011. It suffices to note at this point that the Appellate Division’s order as is reproduced later in this judgment is clearly indicative of the need for the Artha Rin Adalat to actively pursue these avenues available under the existing law and, thereby, arrive at a fair and just resolution of the dispute between the parties. <br/><br/>Mr. Kamruzzaman, learned advocate appearing for the respondent no. 2, in bank opposing the Rule submits that the petitioner has availed of the loan facilities from the bank but failed to repay the loan within time notwithstanding of repeated requests and demands of the bank. The bank tried to sell the mortgaged property through auction under Section 12 of the Act but failed as no bidder was found. Thereafter, the bank filed Artha Ain Suit before the Artha Rin Adalat for recovery of the loan against the petitioner. Said Artha Rin Suit was decreed ex parte against the petitioner giving him 40 days time to pay the decretal amount but  the petitioner failed to pay the money within the said period. Resultantly, the bank filed Artha Jari case and put the decree into execution. The court upon compliance of all relevant provisions of the Act published auction notices in the dailies for sale of the mortgaged property. In the auction three bidders participated and among the bidders the quotation of respondent no. 3 being found highest the court accepted the same with the consent of the bank. There was no illegality in the orders passed by the Adalat. The petitioner got sufficient time to make payment of the decretal amount. But he by filing various applications tried to drag the disposal of the case. It is contended, therefore, that the petitioner in reality is not at all willing to pay the decretal amount. He further submits that the petitioner has no way to get the sale set aside according to law and prays for discharging the rule.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Golam Arshed, the learned advocate appearing for the added respondent no. 3 auction purchaser submits that the respondent no. 3 as highest bidder purchased the mortgaged property and paid entire amount of bid money and the court accepted the bid and as such he has acquired a right in the property. He further submits that the mortgagor Judgment debtor had two options under Rules 89 and 90 of Order 21 of the Code to get the sale set aside by depositing the decretal amount and 5% above the bid money or by filing an application under Rule 90 on the ground of fraud, and illegality, or could claim compen-sation against the bank. But the petitioner failed to take such steps and as such the petitioner has no scope presently to get the sale set aside. In support of his submissions Mr. Arshed referred to the case of M. Karunakara Menon and another -Vs- M. Krishna Menon and 4 others reported in 39 ILR (Madras),  429, Banesa Bibi -Vs- Senior vice President and others reported in 63 DLR (AD) 160, M/S. Antibiotic Stores and others -Vs- Artha Rin Adalat, Dhaka and others reported in 8 MLR (AD) 01, M/S Janapriya  Rice Mills Ltd. -Vs- Bangladesh reported in 17 BLD (HCD) 63, Govt. of Bangladesh and another -Vs- Sheikh Hasina &amp; Another reported in 16 BLT (AD)- 233, and Md. Junnur Rahman -Vs- Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sanstha reported in 17 BLD (HCD)-489.<br/><br/>Heard the learned advocates for the parties, perused the petition, affidavits-in-opposition along with the Annexures appended thereto. Before going through the merit of the rule it would be expedient to look into the relevant provisions of law regarding auction sale and settlement of dispute upon compromise. Sections 38 and 45 of the Act deal with the settlement of dispute through mediation or compromise at any stage of the proceedings and runs thus:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">৩৮। (১) এই আইনের অধীন অর্থ ঋণ আদালত মামলায় প্রদত্ত ডিত্রুীর ধারাবাহিকতায় জারী কার্যত্রুম অব্যাহত থাকার যে কোন পর্যায়ে পক্ষগণ মধ্যসহতার মাধ্যমে জারী মামলার বিষয়বসও নিষ্পত্তি করিয়া আদালতকে অবহিত করিতে পারিবে ।<br/>(২) উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীন মধ্যসহতার ক্ষেত্রে ধারা ২২ এর উপ-ধারা (২), (৩) ও (৪) এ উল্লিখিত বিধান অনুসরণ করিতে হইবে ।<br/>(৩) আদালত, উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীন অবহিত হইলে এবং নিষ্পত্তির বিষয়ে সমওষ্ট হইলে, উত্তু জারী মোকদ্দমা চূড়ামতভাবে নিষ্পত্তি করিয়া আদেশ প্রদান করিবে ।<br/>৪৫। (১) (****) এই আইনের কোন কিছুই, বিচার কার্যত্রুমের পরবর্তী যে কোন পর্যায়ে, কোন মামলার আপোষ নিষ্পত্তি করা হইতে পক্ষগণকে বারিত করিবে না ।<br/>(২) উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীনে প্রদত্ত মামলার আপোষ নিষ্পত্তির সুযোগ এই আইনে মামলা নিষ্পত্তির জন্য ব্যবসিহত অন্যান্য পদ্ধতি এবং নির্ধারিত সময়সীমার হানি বা ব্যত্যয় ঘটাইতে পারিবে না ।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Both the Sections above quoted provide provisions and avenues for the court as well as for the parties to the proceedings to get the dispute settled through mediation and compromise at any stage of the proceedings.

So avenues remain open for the parties to the litigation to get the dispute settled upon taking recourse to the provisions of Sections 38 and/or 45 of the Act.<br/> <br/>Section 49 of the Act deals with the power of the court to allow instalments to the Judgment debtor and runs thus:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">৪৯। (১) উপ-ধারা (৩) এর বিধান সাপেক্ষে অর্থ ঋণ আদালত, বিবাদী-দায়িকের আবেদনের প্রেক্ষিতে বা স্বীয় উদ্যোগে উপযুত্তু মনে করিলে, ডিত্রুীকৃত টাকা ১ (এক) বৎসরে ৪ (চার)টি সমকিসিততে পরিশোধের জন্য দায়িককে সুযোগ প্রদান করিতে পারিবে ।<br/>(২) বাদী-ডিত্রুীদার সম্মত থাকিলে, উপ-ধারা (৩) এর বিধান সাপেক্ষে, ডিত্রুীকৃত টাকা ৩ (তিন) বৎসরে ১২ (বার)টি সমকিসিততে পরিশোধের জন্য আদালত, দায়িককে সুযোগ প্রদান করিতে পারিবে ।<br/>(৩) উপ-ধারা (১) বা (২) এ উল্লিখিত কোন একটি কিসিত বকেয়া হওয়া মাত্রই সমুদয় বকেয়া তখনই পরিশোধিতব্য হইবে এবং তদউদ্দেশ্যে জারী কার্যকর যথাবিধি অনুসৃত হইবে ।   </div><div style="text-align: justify;">This section authorizes the court to allow the judgment debtor to pay the decretal amount by four instalments within one year or by twelve installments within three years if decree holder gives consent.<br/> <br/>Section 57 of the Act empowers the court to pass any order for the purposes of securing justice and runs as follows;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">৫৭। এই আইনের অধীন অভিপ্রেত ন্যায় বিচারের উদ্দেশ্য সাধনকল্পে অথবা আদালতের কার্যত্রুমের অপব্যবহার রোধকল্পে প্রয়োজনীয় যে কোন পরিপূরক আদেশ প্রদানে আদালতের সহজাত ক্ষমতা কোন কিছু দ্বারা সীমিত করা হইয়াছে বলিয়া গণ্য হইবে না ।</div><div style="text-align: justify;">This section speaks that nothing in the Act shall limit the power of the court in passing any order which, in the opinion of the court, is just and practicable for securing ends of justice.<br/> <br/>Apart from this, the provisions in Order 21, Rule 89 of the Code in allowing for a sale to be set aside runs as follows;<br/>R.89. <em>Application to set aside sale on deposit</em>.(1) Where immovable property has been sold in execution of a decree, any person, whose interest has been affected by such sale (provided that such interest has not been voluntarily acquired by him after such sale), may apply to have the sale set aside on his depositing in Court, Said Rule 89 of Order 21 gives the judgment debtor an opportunity to get the sale set aside upon payment of 5% above the bid money and payment of the decretal amount within a specified time. Mr G. Arshed relied upon the judgment in the Karunakara holding that,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">       <em>“Order XXI, rule 89, Civil Procedure Code, is in the nature of an indulgence to judgment-debtors; and a judgment-debtor who wishes to take advantage of the provisions must strictly comply with the same, by paying all the amounts so directed by the rule, less any amount that may have been paid by himself, and he cannot take credit for any amount paid by a co-judgment-debtor who has not Joined him in the application; and according to the rule, credit can be taken only for any amount that may have been actually or constructively received by the decree-holder and not for one which, having been deposited would have been received by him, had he been minded to do so. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We are in complete agreement with the above observations regarding the circumstances under which sale may be set aside by invocation of the process under Order 21, Rule 89.<br/> <br/>Section 26 of the Act also provides that notwithstanding anything which is not repugnant to the Act relating to the execution of the money decree, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure shall be applicable under the Act. But from the said provision it is obvious that   when necessary provisions are already in the Act, the provisions of the Code, would not normally be applicable.<br/><br/>Admittedly the execution proceedings is still pending. In view of the provisions contained in Sections 38 and 45 of the Act the dispute between the parties can be settled or resolved through mediation and compromise. The petitioner, in fact has taken no step for such mediation and compromise, but filed an application seeking time to pay the bank’s dues and for stay of the auction proceedings. Objecting to the perceived dilatory tactic of the petitioner, the Court refused to allow time and/or instalment payments by exercising power under Section 49. Therefore, in rejecting the application of the petitioner the Court instead of extending its hand, indeed, narrowed its power in discharging justice.<br/><br/>It is also noted that the petitioner filed an application on 16.11.2011 under Order 21, Rule 89 of the Code praying for release of the mortgaged property upon payment of 5% interest above the bid money within time as provided by law which was heard on 20.11.2011 and upon hearing the court below vide Order no. 26 of 20.11.2011 rejected the same holding that the petitioner having already filed this writ petition the petition cannot be considered at this stage, the fact of which is reflected in the Rule issuing order of this court. This Court is of the view that the court below ought to have disposed of the application on merit in view of the   provisions of Order 21 Rules 89 and 92 (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, but in not disposing the matter on merit in the light of the provisions of law virtually abdicated its power conferred by law. It is also noted that the petitioner again filed an application on 04.01.2012 for direction upon the bank to accept the balance decretal amount from the petitioner and to set aside the auction sale upon receipt of 5% interest above the bid money. The court after hearing the said application on 05.01.2012 rejected the same vide its order no. 28 dated 05.01.2012. All these attempts of the petitioner primarily shows his willingness to pay the outstanding dues to the bank.<br/><br/>It appears from the available papers in file that the auction was held on 28.09.2011 and accepted on 09.10.2011. The petitioner filed applications praying for time on 26.09.2011, 27.09.2011 and 09.10.2011 to pay the decretal amount which were rejected by the court. In this regard, the court below could have allowed the application at least under Section 57 of the Act as the statutory recognition of its inherent power to do so.  <br/><br/>Messrs Kamruzzaman and Golam Arshed giving emphasis on Section 33 of the Act and Order 21, Rule 89 of the Code argued that the petitioner after holding auction had the option to get the sale set aside by filing application alongwith the deposit of 5% interest above the bid money for payment to the auction purchaser and the decretal money for payment to the decree holder but the petitioner has failed to do so and as such there is no scope left for the petitioner to get the sale set aside at this stage  other than claiming compensation against the bank. But it appears to the Court from the Order Sheets of the court below that the petitioner repeatedly approached it to allow time at the first instance and urged upon the court to release the property upon depositing 5% interest above the bid money and sought a direction upon the bank to accept the balance decretal money at the latest. All those efforts of the petitioner prove to be futile. Had it been considered by the court at the 1<sup>st</sup> instance the matter would have been settled long ago.<br/><br/>From the papers available in record, it appears that the sale is yet to be confirmed as contemplated in Rule 92(1) of the Order 21 of the Code. Admittedly in the instant case the sale has not yet been confirmed. Nor has it became absolute as no formal order of confirmation of sale has been passed by the court below. In paragraph 2 of his supplementary affidavit, the petitioner has stated that he already paid Tk. 1,15,000/- to the bank out of the decretal amount of  TK. 4,60,735/-. It is evident furthermore that the auction purchaser added respondent on. 3 deposited the balance auction money amounting to TK. 5,10,000/- on 16.10.2011. <br/><br/>Mr. Rahman the learned advocate for the petitioner further submits that in a similar situation our Appellate Division passed a judgment in CPLA No. 2228 of 2011 in the case of Abdul Momen Bhuiyan and other -Vs- District Judge, Dhaka &amp; others wherein it has been held that:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“In several cases including the cases of Ganyson Ltd. and another vs. Sonali Bank and other, (1985) 37 DLR (AD) 42 and AFM Naziruddin Vs. Mrs. Hameeda Banu (1993) 45 ALR (AD) 38, this Division previously exercised the power of doing complete justice under Article 104 of the constitution. The subject matter of the instant case represents on occasion to and demands exercise of this by this Division for the purpose of protection of the dwelling house of the petitioners. The petitioners stated to have paid the entire dues payable to the HBFC. Admittedly, the auction purchaser, respondent no. 3 deposited Tk. 75,25,000/- on 22.06.2010 and he should be compensated by the petitioners to retain their valuable house situated at Mirpur, Dhaka. Therefore, the petitioners are directed to pay Tk. 12,00,000/- (twelve lac) to the auction purchaser (respondent no. 3) as compensation within 45 days”.     </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Under our constitutional scheme, this court has no scope to do complete justice as does the Appellate Division. But this court finds that Section 57 of the Act, empowers the Artha Rin Adalat to give adequate relief in cases as in hand, even if it is assumed but not conceded that there is no scope to give the petitioner appropriate relief by the Artha Rin Adalat under the other provision of the Act. Furthermore, in view of the facts and circumstance of this case, the High Court Division is competent enough to give such relief in exercise of its powers under Article 102 of the Constitution as is necessary to safeguard the petitioner’s fundamental right to property under Article 42 of the constitution.<br/><br/>It is also noted that the impugned orders passed by the court are interlocutory and  not final orders and thus no appeal/ revision can be taken therefrom as per provision of Section 44(2) of the Act and, therefore, the present writ is maintainable.<br/><br/>Given that facts and circumstances of the present case, since the auction has not yet been confirmed by the executing court and since the mortgaged property is the only homestead of the petitioner as claimed by the petitioner, for protecting the homestead of the petitioner in our considered view, it was a fit case to exercise the powers under Section 57 of the Ain to give adequate relief to the petitioner, but which the Artha Rin Adalat failed to exercise under said section. In these circumstances we are inclined to dispose of this Rule with the direction to the petitioner judgment debtor to pay 10% above the bid money to the auction purchaser and the balance decretal amount along with the other costs to the bank decree holder within 30 days of the receipt of the certified copy of this judgment and order, failing which the auction sale shall stand absolute.<br/><br/>Before parting  with, this court observes that since the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 is a special law and some latitude is being given to the judgment debtor to get the dispute settled through mediation or compromise and an extensive power has been given to the court to secure justice under sections 38,45,49 and 57 of the Act, the Artha Rin Adalat ought to have acted following the provisions contained  in law as observed  above by this court in supersession of the other provisions contained in any other law as per Section 3 of the Act. But to our utter surprise we see that the Artha Rin Adalat almost in every case is reluctant to extend its hands to help the litigants taking recourse to the above mentioned sections of the Ain making them virtually ineffective.<br/><br/>It is also noted that the intention of the legislature is to recover money not to sell or own the property of the mortgagor making them homeless. Keeping in mind the intention of legislature the Artha Rin Adalat can pass any order for the purpose of securing justice considering facts and circumstances of each individual case.<br/><br/>With the above observations and directions the Rule is disposed of however without any order as to costs.<br/><br/>Order of stay granted at the time of issuance of Rule is hereby recalled and stand vacated.<br/><br/>Communicate a copy of the judgment to the court concerned.<br/><br/><span style="font-size:16px"><u><strong>Syed Refaat Ahmed, J:</strong></u></span><br/><br/>Concurring as I do with the findings and observations of Mahmudul Hoque, J. above, I feel nevertheless the necessity to emphasize the point made by him as to the need to apply the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 (“Act”) in light of its true ambit and purport. This necessarily entails a balancing of all Act’s provisions applicable in each given case and aiming at achieving the best possible practicable solution for the ends of justice. In that regard, it is this Court’s view that the statutorily designated court, i.e. the Artha Rin Adalat consistently appears to shy away from giving a beneficial interpretation to the Act. Thereby, precious opportunities are readily passed over under the Act to mitigate that statute’s obvious harshness as operates against judgment-debtors. This stems, this Court finds, from an ingrained inability to appreciate that the core objective of the Act at debt recovery must not invariably without further qualification entail the acquisition of a defaulter/judgment-debtor’s property. On the contrary there is nothing in the Act that dictates the inevitability of such consequence. Rather, the Act aims expressly to achieve the opposite. Provisions, most notably, in Sections 22, 38, 45, 49 and 57, emphatically attest to that statutory intent. But undue conservatism per se or misconceived reservations either to explore avenues of equitable alternative amicable settlement processes endorsed by the Act itself or to exercise its inherent jurisdiction, for reasons not entirely evident to this Court, operate regrettably to bind the Adalat’s hand as it were. In that context, the Adalat has instead grown so complacently used to a selective and preferential reliance of certain provisions of the Act, that the said Act, particularly through over-subscription to the provisions of Sections 33(5) and 33(7), is inappropriately seen as pandering to the acquisitive tendencies of decree holder banks and financial institutions rather than to facilitating the full recovery of their loans.  There is seen, therefore, a failure by the Adalat to strike an essential balance between financial interests of financial institutions and the fundamental proprietary interests of judgment-debtors that clearly is the Act’s objective and purpose. Such abdication of statutory authority and jurisdiction by the Adalat as a matter of course has led to the above-referred provisions being relegated by disuse to the unavoidable status as dead letters of the law in stark discordance with clear legislative intent to the contrary. This Court is of the view, therefore, that such a situation needs to be addressed and redressed urgently. It is with that intent that this Judgment and Order is particularly being communicated to the concerned Artha Rin Adalat.<br/><br/><strong>        Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Abu Zafor Siddique,J:</u></strong></span><br/> <br/>This Appeal has been preferred against the judgment and order dated 24.03.2009 by which the learned Divisional Special Judge, Rajshahi, in Special Case No.2 of 1998 (Naogaon) convicted the appellant under sections 409, 420 and 477(a) of the Penal Code read with section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 and sentenced him under section 409 of the Penal Code to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10(ten) years and also to a pay fine of taka 1,00,000/-(one lac), in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 2(two) years more.<br/> <br/>The prosecution case, in short, is that the convict-appellant Md. Fazlul Haque, while acting as an officer of the Janata Bank, Nozipur Branch, Naogaon, misappropriated a total amount of Tk. 1,30,223.90 during the calendar year 1984. This money relates to the agricultural loan activities of the Bank. The appellant misappropriated the said money in the following manner:</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"> he realized Tk. 1,16,218.90 from 68 loanees, but without depositing the same, he recorded the amount in the ledger book of the Bank against the names of false and imaginary loanees;    </li><li style="text-align: justify;">he recorded entries in the ledger book about 8(eight) false vouchers showing distribution of Tk. 6,508/- as loan for purchase of fertilizers;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">he realized from 3(three) loanees an excess amount of Tk. 497 and misappropriated the same;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">he showed some false and imaginary (ভূয়া) persons as loanees receiving Tk. 4,000/- as loan, and misappropriated the same.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">The District Anti-corruption Officer, Naogaon lodged the First Information Report (<strong>shortly the FIR</strong>) on the basis of a preliminary inquiry on an application made by another officer of the Bank named Md. Rezaul Karim, recorded as DAB E.R.No.22/91. After lodging FIR, the informant himself conducted part of the investigation. Upon his transfer, his two successors conducted the remaining part of the investigation. The 3rd investigating officer submitted charge-sheet on 21.01.1998 under sections 409/420/477(Ka)/109 of the Penal Code read with section 5(2) of the Anti-corruption Act, 1947 against the convict-appellant and another person named Samorendra Nath, being a fertilizer dealer.<br/><br/>The case was ultimately transferred to the learned Divisional Special Judge, Rajshahi for trial. Charge was framed under sections 409/ 420/477(Ka)/109 of the Penal Code read with section 5(2) of the Anti-corruption Act, 1947. During trial the prosecution produced oral and documentary evidence through 13 out of 25 witnesses cited in the charge-sheet. The defence produced none. From the trend of cross-examination of the P.Ws., the defence pleas appear to be of innocence and wrong investigation and conspiracy. After hearing arguments and on an appraisal of the evidence and materials on record and in view of the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned trial Judge found that the prosecution succeeded in bringing the charge home as against the appellant. Accordingly, he convicted and sentenced the appellant by the impugned judgment, but acquitted the other accused Samorendra.<br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence, the appellant preferred the instant appeal.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Sajjad Ali Chowdhury, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the convict-appellant, submitted that the learned Divisional Special Judge, has misread the evidence and misinterpreted the law, and thus passed the impugned judgment and order which is not tenable in the eye of law.<br/> <br/>He further submitted that the prosecution miserably failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, as not a single witnesses supported the prosecution case, and that this is a case of no evidence.<br/> <br/>Mr. Chowdhury, the learned advocate, lastly submitted that the trial court did not apply judicial mind to the facts and circumstances of the case and thus arrived at a wrong decision.<br/> <br/>In reply Mr. A.K.M. Fazlul Haque, the learned Advocate on behalf of the respondent No.2, being the Anti-corruption Commission, submitted that the prosecution, by producing the relevant documentary and oral evidence, successfully proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and there is nothing wrong in the impugned judgment calling for interference by this court and therefore the appeal should be dismissed.<br/><br/>We have considered the submission of both sides and perused the materials on record of the trial court including the entire evidence and the impugned judgment.<br/><br/>The essence of the charge is that the accused, by taking advantage of his official position as an officer of the Janata Bank, Nozipur Branch, Naogaon, misappropriated Tk.1,30,223.90. The major portion of this amount was Tk.1,16,218.90 which was realized from 68 loanees of the Bank, but this realized money was recorded in the ledger book in the names  of false and imaginary loanees. The remaining amount of the misappropriated money relates to other activities of the accused. So these allegations are basically account matters. The accusations appear refer to various documents. In an attempt to prove these documents. The officers of DAB seized a number of documents in terms of several number seizure lists being Exts.3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10. Photo copies of the bank documents, seized by those seizure lists, have also been produced. A part from the said seizure list and the bank documents, a report of the handwriting expert (Ext.8) has also been produced.<br/><br/>We have perused these documents and other documentary and oral evidence. But the contents of these documents are not traceable in the deposition of the witnesses. Their statements hardly identify the contents of those documents so asto relate them to the charge. This will be clear from the following discussion on the statements of the P.W’s.<br/><br/>P.W.1, Md. Naimul Haq, Assistant Police Super (Retd.) is the informant of the case and he partly investigated the case. He proved the FIR as Ext.1 and a seizure list as Ext.10. He stated that he only stated that the accused misappropriated Tk.1,30,223.90 including the Tk.1,16,218.90 realized from 68 loanees. In his cross-examination he denied the defence suggestions.<br/><br/>P.W.2, Noor Ahamed is the second investigating officer of the case. In examination in-chief he deposed about his actions, during preliminary Inquiry and his part of investigation, namely seizure of the relevant Bank 11 ledger Books of the Banks. He proved the photo copies of the seized documents as Exhibit 3(Ka)/series.<br/><br/>But in his cross-examination he stated that “বিগত ১৮.১২.৯১ ইং তারিখে জব্দকৃত আলামত আদালতে উপস্থাপিত হয় নাই। আলামত গুলি সীজ করিবার পরে যাচাই করিয়া মতামত দিতে পারি নাই।” He further stated that- “অনুসন্ধানকালে আমি কোন প্রতিবেদন দাখিল করি নাই।”<br/><br/>P.W.3, Md. Abul Kalam Azad, Manager of the Janata Bank, Amin Bazar Branch. He stated in examination-in-chief that the seized documents of the Bank seized on 09.09.1991 and 18.12.1991 were given in his custody. But in his cross-examination he stated that- “জিম্মাকৃত কাগজগুলি আদালতে উপসহাপন করা হয় নাই। সীজকৃত কাগজ সম্পর্কে আমার ব্যক্তিগত কোন ধারনা নাই।”<br/><br/>P.W.4, S.M. Ezaj Farid is a Field Assistant Cum-Supervisor of the Janata Bank, Nozipur Branch. At the time of occurrence, he was acting as U.D. Assistant (Krishi) and he witnessed the seizure of the Bank documents. He proved his signatures as on Exhibit 3/3 and 5/1 on the two seizure lists (Ext.3 and 5). He stated in his cross-examination that- “সীজার লিষ্টের স্বাক্ষর করা ব্যাতিত আমি আর কিছু জানি না। সীজকৃত কাগজাদি আদালতে নাই।”<br/><br/>P.W.5, Md. Abdur Razzak is a clerk of the Janata Bank BESIC Branch, Bogra and at the time of occurrence he was working at the Nozipur Branch, Patnitala, Naogaon. He witnessed the seizure of some bank documents and he proved his signatures as 4/3 and 6/1 on the two seizure lists Exts.4 and 6 prepared on 18.12.1991. He stated in his cross-examination that- “কি কারনে ঐ সকল কাগজাদি সীজ করা হয় তাহা জানি না। ঐ সকল কাগজাদির বিষয়ে আমার ব্যত্তিুগত জ্ঞান নাই।”<br/><br/>P.W.6, Md. Khademul Islam, is an officer of the Janta Bank. He witnessed the seizure of some bank documents and he proved his signature as 7/1 on the seizure list Exhibit-7 that was prepared on 12.9.1995. He stated in his cross-examination that- “আমি মামলার ঘটনার বিষয়ে কিছু জানি না।”<br/><br/>P.W.7, Shris Chandra Mondal, Second Officer of the Janata Bank, Nozipur Branch, witnessed the seizure of some bank documents. He proved his signature as Ext.5/2 on the seizure list (Ext.5).

Maria Enterprise who is involved in the business of sand/earth excavation from the river beds by dragger as per the approval so is given by the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (in short, BIWTA). The petitioner duly applied to the said authority for obtaining permission for extraction of sand/ earth from the approach channel of Meghna river under Mouza Syed Khali Showra and Modhupur Gourabdi, Police Station-Hizla, District-Barisal. His application was duly processed by the concerned authority of BIWTA; however, a report was called for on the pheasability of his application; after proper enquiry the concerned officials submitted report on 22.06.2009 (Annexure-A, A(1-3) respectively) for taking necessary steps. The authority concern on 30.06.2009 issued an office letter to the Director, Hydrographic Division of BIWTA to prepare hydrographic chart in favour of the petitioner. Pursuant thereto the BIWTA authority on 16.07.2009 had directed the petitioner to deposit Tk. 1,10,113.74 and to inform the authority concern accordingly (Annexure-B and B-1 respectively). Accordingly, the hydrographic chart was duly prepared by the authority concern of BIWTA identifying the area fit for sand/earth excavation by dragger and had informed the respondent No.5 on 06.08.2009 for taking necessary steps in the matter (Annexure-C). After considering all the reports the BIWTA issued “No objection certificate” on 24.08.2009 to the petitioner and sent it to the Deputy Commissioner, Barisal(respondent No.4) for taking necessary steps vide Memo dated 19.10.2009(Annexure-D) subject to conditions, amongst others, -</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>(৭)............ প্রস্তাবিত ১০,০০,০০০ (দশ লক্ষ) ঘনফুট মাটি ঊত্তোলনের কাজটি অনুমতি পত্র প্রাপ্তির তারিখ হতে ১৫০(একশত পঞ্চাশ) দিনের মধ্যে সম্পন্ন  করতে হবে এবং নির্ধারিত সময়ের মধ্যে কাজ সম্পন্ন করতে ব্যর্থ হলে ঊওু এলাকা মাটি/বালি ঊত্তোলনের বিষয়ে আর কোন দাবী গ্রাহ্য হবে না;<br/>............................</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">জেলা প্রশাসক-এর কার্যালয় হতে অনুমতি প্রাপ্তিসহ জেলা প্রশাসক কর্তৃক সরকারী ফি জমা নেয়ার পর আবেদনকারীকে প্রতি ঘনফুট মাটি/বালি ঊত্তোলনের জন্য ০.১৫ টাকা হারে রয়ালিটির, খনন পূর্ব এবং খননঊত্তর জরিপ কাজের যাবতীয় খরচ বিআইডব্লিঊটিএর অনুকূলে জমা দিতে হবে। এছাড়া আবেদনকারীকে সরকারী নিয়ম অনুযায়ী আয়কর ও ভ্যাট ইত্যাদি বিধি মোতাবেক সংশ্লিষট দপ্তরে পরিশোধ করতে হবে;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Pursuant thereto the petitioner made 2(two) applications dated 25.10.2009 and 02.11.2009 respectively to the Deputy Commissioner, Barisal for allowing him to deposit the royalty as per the “No objection certificate” so issued by the BIWTA, but no action was taken on the said application (Annexure-E and E-1 respectively). Even after receipt of the Memo dated 19.10.2009 from the office of the respondent No.1, the Deputy Commissioner, Barisal kept the matter pending without taking any steps whatsoever facilitating extraction activities of the petitioner.<br/> <br/>Meanwhile, the issue relating to the authority of BIWTA under the existing provision of law to allow individuals to extract sand/earth from a navigable waterways as per the hydrographic chart and the authority of a Deputy Commissioner to float tender of “balumahal”, has been settled by this Hon’ble Court vide judgment and order dated 26.08.2008 passed in writ petition Nos.3198 and 2917 both of 2008 observing, <em>inter alia,</em>-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“ <em>We find from the facts and materials portrayed before us that in order to maintain navigability of rivers and waterways a particular method of excavation is necessary and the actual paths for excavation to be followed is detailed in the Hydrographic Chart prepared by the BIWTA, which were also reflected in the terms of conditions mentioned in the no objection certificate and this appears to be a reflection of the provisions of Rules 53,54 and 55 of the Port Rules, which referred to the excavation of the river beds and issuance of license for that purpose. Rules 53,54 and 55 are quoted below for ease of reference:</em><br/><br/><em>53. <strong>Removal of Substance from</strong></em><strong><em> beds of navigable waterways</em></strong><em>- No person shall remove or cause to be removed gravel, sand, earth or substance <u>from the beds of the navigable waterways of a port,</u> without the prior written permission of the Conservator and without the aid or under the supervision of such person, as the Conservator may appoint to take part in our supervise the performance of such work.</em><br/><br/><em>54. <strong>Constructions and excav ations affecting beds of navigable waterways</strong>- (a) No person shall make any construction or excavation of any kind on the bed or foreshore of navigable waterways <u>within a port</u> without a license from the Conservator. [Emphasis given]</em><br/><em>(b) Any person, who wishes to obtain license and clause(a), shall apply in a prescribed form and shall pay an application fee of five rupess only. [Emphasis given]</em><br/><br/><em>55. <strong>License to construct or excavate</strong>-The Conservator may grant a periodical license applied for under Rule 54 on such terms and conditions as may be specified in the license and charge and collect a license fee for such occupation. In assessing such fee and determining the period of such license, the Conservator shall take into cons-ideration the importance and the nature of construction or excavation, the importance of the area, the volume of traffic, the landing and shipping charges for such traffic, the maintenance of the regime of the navigable waterways, and the effect of the construction or excavation therein. Any contravention of the terms and conditions as may be specified in the license shall render the license liable to cancellation without any notice and the license shall be liable to any of the penalties as specified in the Act.</em><br/><em>This Rule shall be deemed to apply to</em><em> all existing encroachments, constructions or excavation, if any, in or on the beds or foreshore of waterways <u>within a port</u>.</em><br/><br/><em>Turning back to the meeting of 8.7.2007, we find that the committee, which was supposed to report within 15 days, has not yet done so and in the mean time the Deputy Commissioner have floated tender notices for the excavation of the river-beds which is in our view not warranted by the instruction given by the Ministry. In particular it appears from writ petition No.2917 of 2008 that the Deputy Commissioner(Naogaon) has not even considered the aspect of extraction of sand by following the Hydrographic Chart. He has thereby totally ignored the concept of excavation of sand/soil from the river-beds for the purpose of maintaining navigability of the rivers. Similarly in writ petition No.3198 of 2008, although the impugned tender notice floated by the Deputy Commissioner(Tangail) indicates that the extraction is to be made in accordance with the Hydrographic Chart, the excavation process has been opened to general bidders without referring to the need to have a license/no objection certificate for the purpose of excavation as required by Rule 51 of the Port Rules.</em><br/><em>In such view of the matter we find that both the tender notices issued by the Deputy Commissioners are not in acco-rdance with law. Moreover, the instruction given to the Deputy Commissioners by the Ministry of Water Transport (</em><em>নৌ-পরিবহন</em><em>) does not give any indication or direction to the Deputy Commissioner to float a tender, rather it directs the Deputy Commissioner to follow the Rules, and, as we have found earlier, the Rules relevant in this case are the Port Rules,1966, and the provisions of the Rules, 1966 have not been followed in publishing the tender notices.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>A further clarification was made by this Hon’ble Court vide judgment and order dated 07.05.2009 passed in writ petition No.1590 of 2009(Annexure-F). In view of the judgment and order dated 26.08.2008 (Annexure-E), however, an inter-ministerial meeting was held on 02.02.2009. In the said meeting it was decided that BIWTA would continue to give “No objection certificate” with regard to “e›`i mxgvi evwn‡i(evjy gnj e¨vZxZ)” and necessary royalty would be paid to the BIWTA and that the concerned Deputy Commissioner-pursuant to the said decision of BIWTA will take necessary steps to extract sand/earth of the concerned area (Annexure-G).<br/> <br/>In this regard it has also been contended that as per the instruction of the BIWTA vide office letter dated 24.08.2009 the petitioner took all preparation for extraction of sand/earth and to that effect had applied to the respondent No.4 to allow him to pay royalty. In spite of such request the said respondent did not take any steps whatsoever as per the “No objection certificate” issued by the authority concern. Hence, the application.<br/> <br/>Respondent No.9 entered appearance by filing affidavit-in- opposition contending,<em> inter alia</em>, that the Ministry of Shipping had directed the Deputy Commissioner, Tangail and Naogaon to issue license/no-objection certificate for the navigability of the river, if required for  that particular district; but in the said meeting nothing had been mentioned about Barisal district. In this regard it has also been stated that every year the respondent government invest a huge amount of money on the river bank in order to save river erosion area namely Chandpur Town, Lakhsmipur district and also Barisal district. Besides, every year the respondent-government uses boulders in order to protect the river bank of Meghna river.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Also, it has been stated that on 25.07.2010 the Deputy Director and Bandar and Transport Officer, BIWTA, Chandpur Nadi Bandar, Chandpur issued an office letter to the Deputy Commissioner, Chandpur stating, <em>inter-alia,</em> that earlier BIWTA had issued “No objection certificate” in favour of some businessmen for extraction/ excavation of sand/earth from the Padma/ Meghna river bed as per the hydrographic chart, but meanwhile the validity of the said certificates had been expired (Annexure-3). Further, the respondent concern on scrutiny duly had found out that on 05.08.2009 an inter-district meeting was held in the office of the Divisional Commissioner, Chittagong where in clause 16 of the said meeting it has been stated, <em>inter-alia,</em> that there was  a dispute as to fixation of the area of Chittagong, Bhola (Bhola Sadar and Daulat-hkhan), Lakhsmipur (Lakhsmipur Sadar and Ramgati), Bhola (Monpura)-Noakhali (Hatia), Chandpur (Haymchar)-Shariatpur (Goshaiyrhat) and Barisal (Hizla), (Annexure-4).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It has been stated further that the petitioner had obtained “No objection certificate” from the BIWTA on 24.08.2009 and that he had also obtained an order from this Hon’ble Court on 15.11.2009. Since then he has been extracting sand/earth from the river bed by taking undue advantage of the ad-interim order so passed in connection with the present writ petition; whereas vide Annexure-D to the writ petition the petitioner was permitted to extract 10,000,00 (Ten lac) cubic feet sand/earth from the river bed concern. It has also been contended that meanwhile Act No. 62 of 2010(Annexure-2) has been promulgated, where it has been clearly stated, <em>inter-alia,</em> that all “বালুমহল” must be leased out through tender process, as such, if the petitioner is interested to extract sand/earth from the river bed concern then he must go through tender process, as required by law.<br/> <br/>Mr. Mohammad Arshadur Rouf, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner submits that Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (in short, the BIWTA) is the concerned authority for issuing permission for excavation of sand from the river-beds of the navigable rivers, and that having the said power BIWTA had issued “No objection certificate” in favour of the petitioner; as such, the concerned Deputy Commissioner is under legal obligation to provide full support to the petitioner in exercising his right to extract sand/earth from the specified area of Meghna river bed by giving approval to that effect. He further submits that the petitioner did not extract sand/earth from the river bed of Meghna although had received “No objection certificate” from the BIWTA along with a restrain order against those respondents from this Hon’ble Court on 15.11.2009. In this regard, he further submits that on receipt of the said order of injunction he made an application to the Deputy Commissioner, Barisal (respondent No.4) from time to time and lastly, on 17.05.2012 he made a prayer for accepting royalty and to allow him to extract sand from the Meghna river bed in the mouza Syedkhali Sawra and Modhupur. However, despite several applications of the petitioner the respondent No. 4 did not allow him to extract sand from the area concerned on the plea that they have filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.2159 of 2010 before the Appellate Division and the same is pending for hearing (Annexure-X(1). Accordingly, he submits that the BIWTA having issued “No objection certificate” the Deputy Commissioner, Barisal should give permission to the petitioner to extract sand/earth from the Meghna river bed at mouza Syedkhali Sawra and Madhupur Gaurabdi under Hizla Upazila and that the period of limitation to extract sand from Meghna river bed as provided in the said certificate shall start from the date when the permission shall be granted by the respondent No.4. Accordingly, he goes to argue that since no permission as yet has been granted by the said respondent and that the petitioner did not extract any sand from the said river bed; therefore, the period as prescribed in the said certificate is not yet operational. He lastly submits that for extract of sand from the Meghna river bed at Mouza Syed khali Shawra and Modhupur Gourabdi will not go to affect the eco system of Hizla Upazila and it will not cause any damage to the inhabitants of the said Upazilla, for there is no homestead or agricultural land nereby the said area, which is evident from the report of the local authority, so done after physical verification.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Ekramul Hoque, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing with Mr. Titus Hillol Rema and Ms. Farida Yeasmin, the learned Assistant Attorney Generals on behalf of respondent No.1 by filing affidavit in opposition submits that meanwhile the legislature has promulgated “বালুমহাল ও মাটি ব্যবসহাপনা আইন, ২০১০” (in short, the Ain) on 20.12.2012 and that subsequently, in exercise of power as provided under section 16 of the said Ain the respondent government has framed “বালুমহাল ও মাটি ব্যবসহাপনা বিধিমালা, ২০১১” (in short, the Rules). Accordingly, he submits that as per the said Ain and the Rules so made thereunder the Ministry of Land is the sole authority in the matter in question. Moreso, he goes to contend that vide the said Ain extraction of sand/earth from the river bed must be done through tender process. As such, he submits that since the petitioner has not obtained any lease/permission from the appropriate authority, he has no <em>locus standi</em> to extract sand from the land in question; on that score this Rule is liable to be discharged.  He further submits that the administration concerned never disturbed the petitioner, as alleged; rather taking advantage of the interim order of this Hon’ble Court passed in connection with the instant Rule, the petitioner is extracting sand even after expiry of permission of the BIWTA; however, due to the pendency of the instant writ petition the government is being deprived from collecting revenue by leasing out the “বালু মহল” in question through tender process. He also submits that on 22.04.2008 the Ministry of Land issued a memo to the effect that the area which had been mentioned in the hydrographic chart for excavation of sand was to be leased out by the concerned Deputy Commissioner through open tender process (Annexure-1 and 2 respectively) and as such, in view of the said Memo the BIWTA has no authority to accord permission for extraction of sand. Moreso, he submits that in view of the Memo dated 22.04.2008 the concerned Deputy Commissioner is the sole authority to lease out or deal with the matter for extraction of sand, through tender process; since the Deputy Commissioner concern has not leased out the land in question to the petitioner as such, he has no authority to extract sand/earth from the river bed in question. Accordingly, he submits that this Rule being devoid of any substance is liable to be discharged.<br/> <br/>Mr. Moniruzzaman Asad the leaned Advocate appearing for the added respondent No. 9 submits that the extraction of sand from the river bed situated at Hizla Upazila shall create devastating effect upon the whole area of the said Upazila. As a result, the inhabitants of the said area shall loose their homestead, farm land and all their livelihood.<br/> <br/>By filing an affidavit in reply Mr. Rouf submits that mouza Syedkhali Sawra and Modhupur from where the petitioner wishes to extract sand from the Meghna river bed are far away from the shore and in fact, the bank of the said river is at least 2(two) kilometer away from the said area. Moreso, there is no agricultural land nearby the said area. In addition, on physical verification of the said area the concern authority gave clear opinion that excavation of sand from the area concern will not cause any damage to the locality; rather, it is necessary to maintain navigability of the river channel. He further submits that said area is at the down stream of the river; whereas Chandpur Town is at the upper stream of the river and that the Chandpur River Port is about 60 km away from the said place and river bank of Hymchar Upazila is about 15 km away from the said place. He further submits that the area in question is the main channel for Dhaka-Barisal route and that for maintaining navigability of the said channel it is necessary to extract sand from the said channel, as is clearly reflected in the physical verification report of the concern authority. He further submits that the respondent No.9 is a resident of Chandpur district which has no naxus with Hizla Upazila and that Chandpur district is far away from Hizla Upazila of Barisal District; as such, he submits that extraction of sand from Meghna river bed within the Hizla Upazila will in no way affect Chandpur District. He lastly submits that respondent No.9 is a busy body and is not an aggrieved person in view of the context as stated above.<br/> <br/>In this <em>writ of mandamus</em> the claim of the petitioner to allow him to extract sand/earth from Meghna river bed within the approach channel of Mouza Khali Showra and Modhupur Gourabdi, Police Station-Hizla, District- Barisal by the Deputy Commissioner, Barisal is rooted in the hydrographic chart dated 06.08.2009 (Annexure-C) and the “No objection certificate” dated 24.08.2009 (Annexure-D), both issued by the BIWTA.<br/> <br/>From the official correspondences, as annexed by the petitioner to the writ petition, it appears that the procedures to apply for excavation of sand, to prepare hydrographic chart, to make payment to that effect, issuing “no objection certificate” by the BIWTA, are not the product of statute; however, in view of the judgment and order dated 26.08.2008 passed in Writ Petition Nos. 3198 and 2917 both of 2008, those are <em>“....... a reflection of the provisions of Rules 53, 54 and 55 of the Port Rules, .....”.</em> The said procedures were being adopted by the authority concern following practices/guide lines.<br/> <br/>However, meanwhile the legislature on the count of <em>“</em>যেহেতু বালুমহাল ইজারা প্রদান সংত্রুামত জটিলতা নিরসন, বালুমহাল হইতে পরিকল্পিতভাবে বালু ও মাটি উত্তোলন ও বিপণন, উহার নিয়মএণ, এতদসংত্রুামত সংঘটিত অপরাধসমূহ দমন এবং বালুমহাল ব্যবসহাপনার নিমিত্তে একক কর্তৃপক্ষ নির্ধারণের লক্ষ্যে বিধান করা সমীচীন ও প্রয়োজনীয়<em>”</em> has promulgated “ বালুমহাল ও মাটি ব্যবসহাপনা আইন, ২০১০” (in short, the Ain) published in gazette on 20.12.2010 giving overriding effect of  the statute. In this regard section 3 of the Ain provides <em>inter-alia, </em><em>“</em>আইনের প্রাধান্য-<em>Ports Act, 1908 (Act XV of 1908) Inland Water Transport Authority Ordinance, 1958 (E.P.Ord.No.LXXV of 1908) </em>খনি ও খনিজ সম্পদ (নিয়ন্ত্রণ ও উন্নয়ন) আইন, ১৯৯২ (১৯৯২ সনের ৩৯ নং আইন) অথবা কোন আইন বা তদধীন প্রণীত বিধি বা অন্য কোন আদেশ, প্রজ্ঞাপন বা নির্দেশনায় ব্যবস্থাপনা এবং এতদ্সংক্রান্ত অন্যান্য বিষয়ে যাহা কিছুই থাকুক না কেন, এই আইনের প্রাধান্য পাইবে।<br/> <br/>Later, in exercise of power as provided under section 16 of the Ain the respondent government has framed“বালুমহাল ও মাটি ব্যবসহাপনা বিধিমালা, ২০১১ ” (in short, the Rules).

In this regard, rule 3 (1) and (2) of the Rules clearly prescribe the functions of BIWTA with regard to preparation of hydrographic chart of the area which is situated “নৌ বন্দর সীমার বাহিরে”, which are quoted below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“ ৩। ড্রেজিং এর মাধ্যমে বালু উত্তোলন সংত্রুামত বিধান, ইত্যাদি। - (১)<u> নৌ-বন্দর সীমার বাহিরে নির্ধারিত নৌ-পথসমূহ হইতে </u>বালু উত্তোলনের জন্য নৌ-পরিবহন কর্তৃপক্ষ হাইড্রোগ্রাফিক জরিপ কাজ পরিচালনা করিবে এবং হাইড্রোগাফিক চার্টের ভিত্তিতে বালু উত্তোলনের নিমিত্ত ড্রেজিংয়ের এলাকা চিহিুত করিয়া উত্তু চিহিুত সহানের উত্তোলনযোগ্য বালুর পরিমাণ নির্ণয় করিয়া হাইড্রোগ্রাফিক চার্ট, তফসিলসহ মৌজাম্যাপ ও প্রতিবেদন সংশ্লিষ্ট জেলা প্রশাসক বরাবরে প্রদান করিবে। (Emphasis given)<br/>(২) নৌ-পরিবহন কর্তৃপক্ষের হাইড্রোগ্রাফিক চাট, তফসিলসহ মৌজাম্যাপ ও প্রতিবেদন অনুযায়ী এবং আইনের ধারা ৯ এর বিধান অনুসরণত্রুমে সংশ্লিষ্ট জেলা প্রশাসক উত্তু শ্রেণীভূত্তু নৌ-পথকে বালুমহাল ঘোষণা করিবেন। ”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Pursuant to which the concern Deputy Commissioner following the procedure as provided under section 9 of the Ain, 2010 shall declare the said route as “বালুমহল”. However, under section 6 of the Ain, the lease issuing authority<br/>for excavation of sand/earth from the respective “বালুমহল” situated at “ নৌ-বন্দর সীমার বাহিরে” squarely lies with the Ministry of Land, which will co-ordinate said process with the assistance of other related departments/ organizations of the government, which runs as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“ ৬। একক কর্তৃপক্ষ- (১) দেশের যে কোন চর এলাকা অথবা যে কোন সহলভাগ হইতে বালু বা মাটি সরকার কর্তৃক ইজারা প্রদানের ক্ষেত্রে এবং সরকারি যে কোন কর্তৃপক্ষ কর্তৃক নির্দিষ্ট নদী, নদী বন্দর, সমুদ্র বন্দর, খাল-বিল প্রভৃতি সহান হইতে উত্তোলিত বালু বা মাঢি~র বিপণনের প্রয়োজন দেখা দিলে উত্তু বিপণনের জন্য একক কর্তৃপক্ষ হইবে ভূমি মমএণালয়।<br/>৬(২) উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীন কার্যত্রুম গ্রহণের ক্ষেত্রে ভূমি মমএণালয় প্রয়োজনে সংশ্লিষ্ট সংসহা বা কর্তৃপক্ষের সহিত সমন্বয় করিবে ।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In view of the stated position of law, a clear demarcation can be drawn in between the authority of the BIWTA and the Deputy Commissioner concern over excavation of sand/earth of the concerned river bed. As per rules 53,54and 55 of the Port Rules, (as quoted above) the Conservator (the BIWTA) is to give written permission to the respective licensee for excavation of sand/earth from the river bed situated <em>“within a port”;</em> whereas, vide sections 6 and 9 of the Ain and rule 3 of the Rules, 2011 the Ministry of Land, is the sole authority with regard to excavation of sand/earth “নৌ-বন্দর সীমার বাহিরে নির্ধারিত নৌ-পথ সমুহ হইতে .........”.<br/><br/>In the present writ petition, the petitioner has failed to show with supporting documents that the area in question is situated “নৌ-বন্দর সীমার বাহিরে .......”; as such, the direction so sought for by the petitioner cannot be entertained in the eye of law.  Accordingly, the decisions so have been relied upon by the petitioner cannot be made applicable in the facts and circumstances of the instant case.<br/><br/>At this juncture, the learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that since pursuant to the direction of BIWTA the petitioner has already paid royalty hence, a vested right has accrued in his favour; moreover, prior to promulgation of the said Ain of 2010 process to excavate sand/earth from the concerned river has been initiated by the BIWTA; hence, Act 62 of 2010 cannot be made applicable in the case of the petitioner.<br/><br/>It is fact that process to allow the petitioner for excavation of sand/earth form the concerned river bed had commenced prior to promulgation of the Act No. 62 of 2010; but meanwhile vide the said Act the legislature has clearly vested the power to grant lease to the Ministry of Land as “একক করতিপক্ষ", covering the area as designated under section 9 of the Ain of 2010. However, since the petitioner has failed to show with supporting documents that the area in question is situated “নৌ-বন্দর সীমার বাহিরে” as such, in order to excavate sand/earth of the area concern the petitioner has to come within the ambit of Act No. 62 of 2010, for vide section 3 of the said Act the applicability of other related laws have been over-ruled.<br/><br/>However, so far excavation of sand/earth from Meghna river bed beyond the prescribed period, as mentioned in Annexure-D to the writ petition, it is the categorical assertion of the petitioner that he did not excavate sand/earth from the said area of Meghna, which is, however, disputed by the respondent-government.<br/><br/>Since this court cannot embark into a disputed issue hence, refrains from making any observation to that effect.<br/><br/>In the result, the Rule is discharged without any order as to costs.<br/><br/>The authority concern is hereby directed to initiate process of tender immediately preferrably within a period of 1(one) month from the date of receipt of the copy of this judgment and order in due compliance of law.<br/><br/>There will be no order as to costs.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

On taking oath on 06.05.2011 he entered into the office of the said union parishad. It has been contended that the petitioner had been discharging his duties as Chairman of the said union parishad for near about 2(two) years and that no complain whatsoever had ever been raised against him during this period.<br/><br/>On 08.02.2012 one Abdul Alim Molla, Member, Ward Nos.6 and 5, Borodal Union Parishad, Ashashuni, Sathkira made a complaint to the respondent No.1 bringing allegations of corruption and misappropriation of public fund against the petitioner (Annexure-B). Pursuent thereto the respondent No.4 had been directed to enquire into the matter and to submit a report thereof. The said respondent after due inquiry submitted report to the authority concern on 12.08.2012 for consideration (Annexure-C). However, pursuant to the inquiry report the respondent No.4 had directed the petitioner to submit his reply. Accordingly, on 01.10.2012 he replied to the allegations so made against him (Annexure-D). On receipt thereof the respondent No.4 vide Memo No. LG/46.44.87.00.007.27.004 (ashashuni). 12-45 dated 28.01.2013 had forwarded the enquiry report along with the reply of the petitioner to the respondent No.1 for taking necessary action (Annexure-E). Considering those materials the respondent No. 3 vide the impugned Memo dated 28.01.2013 had suspended the petitioner from the post of Chairman of No.5 Borodal Union Parishad, Ashashuni, Sathkira under section 34(4) of the Ain, 2009 on the allegation of corruption and misappropriation of public fund(Annexure-F).<br/><br/>In writ petition No. 10166 of 2013 it has been stated that the petitioner is the elected Chairman of No. 3 ছাগলাদহ ইউনিয়ন পরিষদ, তেরখাদা, খুলনা, who had been discharging his duties and functions without any objection from any quarter whatsoever. It has been contended that 6(six) other elected members of Chagladha Union Parishad under Terokhadha Upazila made an allegation to the respondent No. 3 against the petitioner for corruption and mismanagement in the respective development project. Pursuent thereto the respondent No. 3 had directed the respondent No. 4 to enquire into the matter and submit a report. Accordingly, respondent No. 5 inquired into the allegation and submitted a report to the respondent No.3 on 17.07.2013 for consideration. Pending inquiry process the Union Parishad Members who made the allegations had subsequently withdrawn his complaint vide application dated 06.06.2013 stating, <em>inter-alia,</em> that they made allegations out of their personal grudge but the inquiry officer i.e. the respondent No.4 without taking into consideration of the said withdrawal letter had submitted an inquiry report against the petitioner. The respondent No. 4, however, during the course of inquiry had asked the petitioner to show cause in respect of the allegations as brought against him. On 26.02.2013 the petitioner categorically explained denying the allegations so made against him. But without taking personal hearing of the petitioner and without proper inquiry and investigation as well as without hearing to the complainants who made the allegations the Inquiry Officer had submitted an inquiry report. On receipt thereof the respondent No. 3 vide Memo No. 40.46.4700.024.02.00.13 dated 18.07.2013 had forwarded the same to the respondent No. 1 to take necessary steps in the matter. Pursuent thereto the respondent No. 2 vide the impugned Memo No. ¯nvmwe/Bc/BEwc-39/99/722 dated 23.09.2013 had suspended the petitioner from his office and communicated the same to the respondent No.4 asking him to arrange appointment of a Chairman from the elected panel Chairman.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the petitioners concern have preferred the instant applications and obtained the present Rules Nisi.<br/><br/>Mr. A.M. Amin Uddin, the learned Advocate appearing with Mr. Nakib Saiful Islam, the learned Advocate for the petitioner in Writ Petition No. 10166 of 2013 and Mr. M. Ashraf Ali the learned Advocate for the petitioner in Writ Petition No. 3705 of 2013 co-jointly  submit that from the impugned order(Annexure-F) it appears that the respondent No.3 has suspended the petitioner sexercising his power as provided under section 34(4)(gha) of the Local Government(Union Parishad) Ain, 2009(in short, the Ain, 2009). In this regard referring to section 34(4)(gha) of the said Ain it has been argued that the same does not confer any such power to suspend the petitioners rather aforesaid section only prescribes a disqualification of a Chairman for which he can be removed from his post; Consequently, suspending the petitioner under the said provision of law is without jurisdiction.<br/>Further, it has been submitted that a Chairman of a union parishad can be suspended under section 34(1) of the Ain,2009, but in such a case a proceeding for removal of the said Chairman has be started. In the instant case, it is evident from record that the respondents have suspended the respective petitioners without initiating any proceeding for removal. In such view of the matter, it has been contended that the impugned order is illegal. Again, it is submitted that section 34(1) of the said Ain has prescribed the circumstances under which a Chairman of a union parishad may be suspended from his respective post, but before such suspension the government must also form an opinion, as required under the said provision of law. However, the impugned orders do not disclose as to how the government was satisfied that continuation of the Chairmanship by the petitioners would be prejudicial to the interest of union parishad or undesirable on the count of public interest. Accordingly, it has been submitted that upon making both the Rules absolute declaring the impugned orders to have been passed without any lawful authority those need to be struck down.<br/><br/>Ms. Nusrat Jahan, the learned Assistant Attorney General, appearing on behalf of respondent-government submits that pursuant to the complaint so have been received from the respective quarters both the contending parties i.e., the petitioners and the complainant, were duly notified to attend the hearing. However, on the date and time so fixed for hearing of the parties, both of them were present with their respective witnesses and that the hearing was duly and properly concluded in the presence of the authority concern. The inquiry committee so had been constituted to that effect ultimately opined that the allegations so had been brought against the petitioners were found correct. Accordingly, the same was duly forwarded with all relevant records to the Ministry concern to take appropriate steps in the matter. Being satisfied the respondent No.1, the concern Ministry issued the order of suspension being duly empowered under section 34(1) of the “সহানীয় সরকার (ইঊনিয়ন পরিষদ) আইন, ২০০৯”  (Act No. 61 of 2009) (in short, the Ain). As such, she goes to submit that before issuance of the impugned orders due procedures have been initiated against the respective petitioners, for no other procedures have been prescribed or referred to or mentioned within the four corners of the said Ain, 2009 and that according to section 34(2) of the Ain,2009 the penal Chairman will now discharge the functions as the acting Chairman till temporary suspension is withdrawn or till re-election of the Chairman has been held after the said removal.<br/><br/>So far the opinion of the respondent-government is concerned Ms. Nusrat goes to submit that in <strong><em>Bangladesh </em></strong>Vs. <strong><em>Lokman Patwari and another</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>46 DLR (AD) 163 </em></strong>the Appellate Division has clearly expresed their observations contending, <em>inter-alia,</em> <em>“the High Court Division completely failed to consider that this is not a case where there was no formation of opinion at all. The impugned order clearly shown that an opinion was formed and was expressed, definitely and decisively. Considerable materials were there before the government for formation of opinion in the way it has been formed”</em>. In the said case the Appellate Division accordingly found <em>“we have decided not to interfere with the judgment and order of the High Court Division not because the reasonings given by the learned Judges were correct but because the basis on which the government based its action no longer exists.”</em> In the instant cases, she submits that the opinion was duly and properly formed by the respondent government, for it has been clearly spelt out in the temporary suspension orders that because of the allegation of corruption, holding the office of Chairman of the concerned union parishad by the petitioners should not continue in the interest of public. Accordingly, she submits that both Rules Nisi being devoid of any substance are liable to be discharged.<br/><br/>Previously with a view to provide for the constitution of union parishad for the union in rural areas and for matters incidental or ancillary thereto the Chief Martial Law Administrator had promulgated the Local Government(Union Parishad Ordinance,1983)( in short, the Ordinance).<br/><br/>Section 65 of the said Ordinance, however, has authorized the government to suspend the Chairman in certain circumstances mainly 1. where any proceeding has been initiated for the removal of the Chairman under section 12; or 2. where any criminal proceedings of any law have been started against the Chairman; or 3. where on an inquiry by the government, he is found to be guilty of any misconduct within the meaning of section 12(1) and that in the opinion of the government the exercise of power by him as Chairman is either likely to be prejudicial to the interest of the union parishad or undesirable from the point of view of public interest. Accordingly, the government may, by order in writing, place such Chairman under suspension.<br/><br/>The said Ordinance has subsequently been repealed with the promulgation of a new statute under the name and style সহানীয় সরকার(ইঊনিয়ন পরিষদ) আইন, ২০০৯ (Act No. 61 of 2009)(in short, the Ain).<br/><br/>Section 34 of the said Ain provides power to the government to suspend the Chairman or the Members of a union parishad a) where proceedings have been initiated for removal of a Chairman or the Members for the offence as described in section 34(4) of the Ain; b) where police report in connection with a criminal case has been accepted by the Adalat concern; or c) where the Adalat has taken cognizance of the offence; and that in the opinion of the the designated authority “নির্ধারিত কর্তৃপক্ষ” the exercise of power by the said Chairman or the Members is likely to be prejudicial to the interest of the respective union parishad or undesirable from the administrative point of view; the government may, by order in writing, place such Chairman or the Members under suspension.<br/><br/>Section 34(1) of the Ain, 2009 is accordingly quoted herein below:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“৩৪। চেয়ারম্যান বা সদস্যগণের সাময়িক বরখাস্তকরণ ও অপসারণ।-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">যে ক্ষেত্রে কোন পরিষদের চেয়ারম্যান বা সদস্যের বিরুদ্ধে ঊপ-ধারা (৪) এ বর্ণিত অপরাধে অপসারণের জন্য কার্যএুম আরম্ভ করা হইয়াছে অথবা তাঁহার বিরুদ্ধে ফৌজদারী মামলায় অভিযোগপত্র আদালত কর্তৃক গৃহীত হইয়াছে অথবা অপরাধ আদালত কর্তৃক আমলে নেওয়া হইয়াছে, সেইক্ষেত্রে নির্ধারিত কর্তৃপক্ষের মতে চেয়ারম্যান অথবা সদস্য কর্তৃক ক্ষমতা প্রয়োগ পরিষদের স্বার্থের পরিপন্থী অথবা প্রশাসনিক দৃষিটকোণে সমীচীন না হইলে, সরকার লিখিত আদেশের মাধ্যমে চেয়ারম্যান অথবা সদস্যকে সাময়িকভাবে বরখাস্ত করিতে পারিবে| ”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>So far the present case is concerned the petitioners, the Chairmen of the respective union parishad, have been suspended under section 34(4)(gha) of the Ain,2009 vide Memo No. সহাসবি/ইপ/ইঊপি-৪৪/২০০৮/১৫৪ dated 28.03.2013 (Annexure-F) of writ petition No. 3705 of 2013 and Memo No. সহাসবি/ইপ/ইঊপি-৩৯/৯৯/৭২২ dated 23.09.2013 dated (Annexure-E) of the writ petition No. 3705 of 2013. The contents of Memo dated 28.03.2013 (Annexure-F), however, are quoted below:<em>-</em><br/><br/>A Chairman or Member of the respective union parishad is liable to be removed on the allegation, <em>inter alia</em>-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“ ৩৪(৪)(ঘ) অসদাচরণ বা ক্ষমতার অপব্যবহারের দোষে দোষী হন অথবা পরিষদের কোন অর্থ বা সম্পত্তির কোন ক্ষতি সাধন বা ঊহার আত্মসাতের বা অপপ্রয়োগের জনা দায়ী হন ;  ”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In other words, if he is found guilty of misconduct or causes abuse of power or loss to any property of the union parishad or is found to have misappropriated fund or property of the respective union parishad he may be suspended under section 34(1) of the Ain,2009.<br/><br/>However, in the explanation “e¨vL¨v” under section 34(4) the word “Am`vPiY” has further been defined as-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“ব্যাখ্যাঃ এই ঊপ-ধারায় 'অসদাচরণ' বলিতে ক্ষমতার অপব্যবহার, কর্তব্যে অবহেলা, দুর্নীতি, স্বজনপ্রীতি ও ইচ্ছাকৃত কুশাসনও বুঝাইবে| ”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Vide section 34(5) the government or the government nominated designated authority may remove the Chairman or the respective members of the concerned union parishad upon publishing in gazette. However, before finalization of the order of removal there has to be an inquiry following the procedures as prescribed in the Rules and that the incumbent has to be provided an opportunity to  represent his case. Under section 34(6) on obtaining approval of the respondent government on the proposal for the said removal the incumbent concerned shall be removed <em>ipso facto</em>.<br/><br/>Section 34(5) and (6) are accordingly quoted below:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“৩৪(৫) সরকার বা সরকার কর্তৃক নির্ধারিত কর্তৃপক্ষ সরকারি গেজেটে আদেশ দ্বারা, উপ-ধারা (৪) এ উল্লেখিত এক বা একাদিক কারণে চেয়ারম্যান বা সদস্যকে অপসারণ করিতে পারিবেঃ<br/>তবে শর্ত থাকে যে, অপসারণের সিদ্ধান্ত চুড়ান্ত করিবার পূর্বে বিধি মোতাবেক তদন্ত করিতে হইবে ও অভিযুক্তকে আত্নপক্ষ সমর্থনের সুযোগ দিতে হইবে।<br/>(৬) কোন চেয়ারম্যান বা সদস্য এর অপসারণের প্রস্তাব, সরকার বা সরকার কর্তৃক নির্ধারিত কর্তৃপক্ষ কর্তৃক অনুমোদন লাভের পর তিনি তাৎক্ষণিকভাবে অপসারিত হইবেন। ”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The combined effect of section 34(1),(4),(5) and (6) of the Ain is that if there be any allegation as prescribed in section 34(4) the authority concern has to make an inquiry on the same, following the procedures as prescribed in the Rules so made thereunder. In other words, pending proceedings so initiated for removal of the Chairman or the Member the inquiry under section 34(5) has to be made following the Rules so framed in this regard.<br/><br/>However, the fact remains that no Rule as yet has been framed by the government in exercise of power as provided under section 96 of the Ain. Though section 108 (1) and (2)(kha) of the Ain provides that –</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“রহিতকরণ এবং হেফাজত।-(১) এই আইন বলবৎ হইবার সংগে সংগে Local Government (Union Parishads) Ordinance, 1983 (Ord.

On perusal of the said Rules it appears that rules 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 and 12 of the said Rules have prescribed the procedures to be followed in this regard. In the instant case, the said procedures do no appear to have been followed.<br/>At this juncture, the learned Assistant Attorney General appearing for the respondent-government submits that proceedings for suspension and the proceedings for removal are disjunctive. Since prior to issuance of the impugned order due inquiry was made with the issuance of show cause notice upon the petitioners concern and that both of them replied to the same; as such, it is apparent that in due compliance of law the orders of suspension have been issued.<br/><br/>The said contention of the respondent-government is a misconceived one, for the government is authorized to suspend a Chairman or a Member when “Ec-aviv (4 G ewY©Z) Aciv‡a Acmvi‡bi Rb¨ Kvh©G“g Avi¤¢ Kiv nBqv‡Q” means, suspension in a pending proceeding for removal and that the said procedures for removal have been enunciated in Rules,1984, for till date no Rules have been framed by the government under section 96 of the Ain, 2009, as observed earlier. In this regard, the respondent-government has failed to show that it has duly initiated proceedings for removal of the concerned Chairman or the Members, as the case may be, in compliance of Rules, 1984 and that the pending proceedings for removal of the petitioners they have been suspended. However, previously section 65 of the Ordinance provided that a Chairman might be suspended “where on an inquiry by the government he is found to be guilty of any misconduct within the meaning of section 12(1)”; whereas under section 34(1) of the Ain, 2009 he may be suspended by the government in exercise of power as provided therein when “Ec-aviv 4 G ewY©Z Aciv‡a Acmvi‡bi Rb¨ Kvh©G“g Avi¤¢ Kiv nBqv‡Q| ” From the using of those words the intention of the legislature can clearly be gathered that for suspension there has to be a pending proceeding for removal of a Chairman or a member in exercise power under section 34(1), which is absent in the present cases.<br/><br/>So far the opinion of the respondent government is concerned, it appears on a plain reading of section 34(1) of the Ain that exercise of such power by the government is conditional so far formation of opinion is concerned. The said issue has earlier been agitated in <strong><em>Bangladesh </em></strong>Vs. <strong><em>Lokman Patwari and another</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>46 DLR (AD)163</em></strong>. The Appellate Division while making observations to that effect categorically found, <em>inter-alia</em>,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“Whenever in any statute the exercise of power by any authority is made conditional upon the formation of opinion of such authority, the formation of opinion is a sine qua non for the exercise of such power. Mere existence of any of the three circumstances mentioned in section 65(1) will not be enough. The Government also must form an opinion in terms of the language mentioned in section 65(1). The opinion is formed by the Government after considering the materials before it and after being satisfied that the materials have a causal connection with the kind of opinion that it is required to form. If there are no materials at all on which to form an opinion or if the materials that exist are totally unconnected with the kind of opinion that the Government is required to form then the order of suspension will fall through.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the light of the observations of the Appellate Division, so made, in   particular at paragraph 10, if there is some indication in the order of suspension itself that the allegation so brought against the Chairman/Members is likely to be prejudicial to the interest of the union parishad or undesirable from the administrative point of view it will suffice the requirement, for the Court will only see that there is a causal connection in both the materials and the opinion. In the present case, on the count of “অর্থ আত্মসাৎ ও দুর্নীতির অভিযোগ প্রমাণিত হওয়ায়........”  the respondent-government has duly suspended the petitioners under section 34(4)(Gha), but without considering the position of law that there has to be a pending proceeding for removal, which has not been initiated in the present case. Accordingly, we have no manner of doubt to find that though there is nexus in between the materials so placed before the respondent government and its opinion but since orders of suspension have been passed against the respective petitioners without intiating proceedings, as are required under the Rules of 1984 hence, issuance of the impugned orders are liable to be knocked down for having been issued without any lawful authority and thus, have no legal effect.<br/><br/>In this regard, it will not be out of place to observe that on perusal of rule 4 of the Rules, 1984 it appears that while requisition is being taken in the respective meeting stating the grounds for removal either of the Chairman or the Members it must be endorsed with the signature of the Chairman, whereas the whole proceeding is being initiated for his removal, which is absurd and works against his own interest.<br/><br/>In view of the said position of law, we are of the opinion that since admittedly the respondent-government has not yet framed any Rules under the Ain, 2009 a proper Rule ‘‘বিধিমালা’’ should be framed highlighting the said lacuna, as has been observed and fill up the same in accordance with law.<br/><br/>In view of the above facts and circumstances, observations and findings we find substance in both the Rules and accordingly both the impugned Memo Nos. সহাসবি/ইপ/ইঊপি-৪৪/২০০৮/১৫৪ dated 28.03.2013 and সহাসবি/ইপ/ইঊপি-৩৯/৯৯/৭২২ dated 28.09.2013  are liable to be declared to have issued been issued without lawful authority for having been issued without complying the requirements of law as prescribed in the statute i.e., the Ain, 2009 and the Rules, 1984.<br/><br/>In the result, both the Rules are made absolute.<br/><br/>The impugned Memo Nos. সহাসবি/ইপ /ইঊপি-৪৪/২০০৮/১৫৪ dated 28.03.2013 and সহাসবি /ইপ/ইঊপি-৩৯/৯৯/৭২২ dated 28.09.2013 issued under the signature of respondent Nos.2 and 3, temporarily suspending the petitioners from the post of elected Chairman of Chagladaha Union Parishad, Terokhada, Khulna and No.5 Borodal Union Parishad, Ashashuni, Satkhira (Annexure-E and F respectively) are hereby declared to have been passed without lawful any authority and hence, are of no legal effect.<br/><br/>However, since the impugned order has been knocked down by this Court for non-compliance of law as such, the respondent-government will be at liberty to issue a fresh order in strict compliance of law, if so desires.<br/>There will be no order as to costs.<br/><br/><strong>        Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Mahmood by the then Government of East Pakistan vide lease deed No. 2892 dated 11.07.1960 for 99 years. While the said original lessee was in possession of the property in question he died leaving behind his wife Salma Begum, 3 sons Shakil, Zahed Mahmood, Arshad Mahmood and daughter Gazla Mahmood. Said Salma Mahmood filed Act VIII case being No. 451 of 1974 in the court of District Judge, Dhaka and in that case she was appointed guardian of the minors and thereafter she obtained permission from the said court to sell the case property vide permission case No. 546 of 1974. She paid all necessary charges to the authority concerned and accordingly a clearance certificate dated 22.08.1974 was issued by the Administrative Officer certifying payment of  all dues by the lessee Md. Mahmood.<br/><br/>Thereafter, Salma Begum @ Salma Mahmood, as guardian duly appointed by the court, sold the case property to the petitioner by a registered deed of sale being No. 167 dated 03.01.1975 and handed over possession thereof. Since then the petitioner has been possessing the case property and living therein with her family and mutated her name in the Khatian and paid rents to the Government. The petitioner applied to the Assistant Commissioner, Settlement, for mutation of her name in the record of the housing estate and accordingly, Assistant Commissioner, Settlement issued a letter No. 1839/C-S dated 25.03.1985 asking the petitioner to submit necessary papers and documents. The petitioner submitted all necessary documents as asked for. Thereafter, a survey was held by a survey team headed by Assistant Engineer Mr. Salimullah Bhuiyan on 17.07.1983 wherein the petitioner was found in possession. In the remark column of the survey report dated 13.01.1984, it was stated that “Mrs. Salma Begum @ Salma Mahmood wife of late Md. Mahmood the successor of the original lessee sold out the property to the present occupier Mrs. Sayeda Mohsina and the name has not yet been mutated in respect of the present occupant. Since Mrs. Salma Begum the successors of original lessee is residing in V-A/7 Razia Sultana Road, Block-D, Mohammadpur, Dhaka, the property may not be treated as an abandoned property.”<br/><br/>In spite of the findings in the survey report, the case property of the petitioner being included in the list of abandoned buildings, the petitioner filed an application under Section 7(1) of the  Abandoned Buildings (Supplementary Provisions) Ordinance, 1985 (“Ordinance”) before the Court of Settlement. The said application was registered as Case No. 32 of 2000. The Government contested the case, however, without filing any written statement.<br/><br/>The Petitioner contends that the Court of  Settlement heard the case and upon hearing dismissed the same  by its Judgment and Order dated 19.11.2001 but without taking into consideration the papers and documents submitted before it to substantiate the claim of the petitioner. Against this backdrop the petitioner moved this Court by filing this application under Article 102 of the constitution challenging the Judgment and Order passed by the Court of Settlement and obtained the present Rule and Order of stay.<br/>The Respondent No. 2, Government of Bangladesh contested the Rule by filing an Affidavit-in-Opposition denying all the material allegations made in the petition contending inter alia that the original lessee of the case property Md. Mahmood during the War of Liberation of 1971 left this country leaving the case property uncared for and thus he ceased to occupy, supervise and manage the case property in person at the relevant time i.e. on 28.02.1972 being the date promulgation of The Bangladesh Abandoned Property (Control, Management and Disposal) Order, 1972 (“P.O. 16 of 1972”). Consequently, the Government declared the case property as an abandoned property under the provision of Article 2(1) of the P. O. 16 of 1972. It is contended that the alleged sale by Salma Begum to the petitioner Sayeda Mohsina by registered deed of sale dated 03.01.1975 is accordingly, null and void under the provisions of Article 6 of the P.O. 16 of 1972. It is also asserted that Md. Mahmood’s whereabouts were not known to the concerned authority and the Government, consequentially, after completing all formalities published the Gazette under the provision of Section 5(1) of the Ordinance which is conclusive evidence of fact of the abandoned status of the case property under Section 5(2) of the Ordinance. It is also asserted that the petitioner has failed to prove her case by adducing evidence to the effect that the original owner Md. Mahmood was present in Bangladesh and he occupied, managed or supervised the disputed building when P.O. 16 of 1972 came into force. Hence, it is submitted that the very listing of the case property in the “Kha” list of the abandoned buildings is lawful and conclusive proof of facts and that the Court of Settlement passed the Judgment and Order rightly and considering the papers and documents filed by the claimant.<br/><br/>Mr. Z.I. Khan Panna with Mr  Mozno Mollah and Munir Tanveer -E- Mahbub, the learned Advocates for the petitioner supporting the Rule submit that in the present case the original lessee Md. Mahmood was in possession of the case property till his death in this country as a national of Bangladesh. After the death of the said Md. Mahmood his wife, 3 sons and only daughter inherited the property as his legal heirs. They also were in possession, control and management of the property. The aforementioned sons and daughter of Late Md. Mahmood being minors his wife Salma Begum @Salma Mahmood got herself appointed as guardian of her minor children through court and subsequently obtained permission for sale of the property for the benefit of the minors vide Permission Case No. 546 of 1974. Thereafter, she herself and on behalf of her minor children sold the case property to the petitioner by a registered deed of sale being No. 167 dated 03.01.1975 as citizen of Bangladesh and handed over possession to the latter. Since then the petitioner has been possessing the case property and living thereon with her family members. It is also submitted that the said Md. Mahmood never left this country at any time before and after the promulgation of P.O. 16 of 1972 and he was in possession of the property till his death as a national of Bangladesh.<br/><br/>Mr. Khan further submits that service of notice under Section 5(1)(b) of the Ordinance upon the owner or occupier of the case property is a condition precedent as set forth in the Ordinance before enlistment of the property in the “Kha” list. It is contended that in the instant case no such notice was issued or served upon the petitioner or her vendors either under Article 7 of P.O. 16 of 1972 or under Section 5(1)(b) of the Ordinance before the listing of the property in the ‘Kha’ list of the abandoned buildings and as such the enlistment of the property in the list of the abandoned buildings is palpably illegal and without jurisdiction. It is also argued that since the original lessee Md. Mahmood was a citizen of Bangladesh and was in possession, control and supervision of the case property at all material times and died in Bangladesh as a Bangladeshi national the property in question cannot be under the law treated as an abandoned property. He further submits that the Court of Settlement in its Judgment totally ignored the fact of the granting of a guardianship certificate by a competent court and permission for selling the property on behalf of the minor children and as such the Judgment and Order of the Court of Settlement is based on non-consideration of material evidence adduced by the petitioner claimant before it. In support of his submissions Mr. Khan has referred to the cases of Bangladesh -vs- Helaluddin Ahmed reported in 4 MLR (AD) 40, Bangladesh -vs- Md. Shahjahan reported in 2 ADC (2005) 411, Bangladesh -vs- Bibi Morium reported in 54 DLR (AD) 100, Bangladesh -vs- Nasima Khatun reported in 57 DLR (AD) 97 and Syeda Chand Saltana &amp; others -vs- Bangladesh reported in 1 MLR (HCD) 310.<br/><br/>Mr. Shahidul Islam, the learned Deputy Attorney General with Mr. Sukumar Biswas, the learned Assistant Attorney General appearing for the Respondent No. 2, Government in opposing the Rule submit that the person who claims the case property is not an abandoned property is to prove that the original lessee, in the instant case Md. Mahmood, occupied, managed or supervised the case property on the relevant date, i.e. on 28.02.1972. The petitioner having failed to prove the same, the inclusion of the building in the ‘Kha’ list is submitted to be proof enough of it being an abandoned property and the Government has in the circumstances nothing to prove or deny. Mr. Islam further submits that in the present case the petitioner could not show that Md. Mahmood was present in Bangladesh on material dates or that he occupied, managed or supervised the case property when P.O. 16 of 1972 came into operation and as such the listing of the property in the ‘Kha’ list as abandoned property is lawful and in turn constitutes conclusive proof of the fact of abandonment of the property. It is also argued that under Writ Jurisdiction this Court cannot sit over the Judgment of the Court of Settlement as a court of  appeal unless it could be shown that the Court of Settlement   had acted without jurisdiction or made any finding upon no evidence or without considering any material evidence or that it had acted mala fide or in violation of any principles of natural justice. In support of his submissions he referred to the cases of Bangladesh &amp; others –vs- Md. Jalil and others reported in 48 DLR (AD) 10, Secretary, Ministry of Works -vs- Rowshan Ara Begum reported in 57 DLR (AD) 167 and Bangladesh – vs- A.T.M. Mannan and others reported in 1 BLC (AD) 8.<br/>Heard the learned Advocates for the parties, perused the application, Affidavit-in-Opposition and annexures annexed thereto as well as the Records called for by this Court from the Court of Settlement.<br/><br/>The petitioner to substantiate her claim has annexed to the Writ Petition all the relevant documents e.g. allotment order dated  16.1.1960 (Annexure-A), Original lease deed dated 9.2.1960 (Annexure-A1), Certified copies of two applications made in Act VIII Case No. 451 of 1974 and in the Permission Case No. 456 of 1974 ( Annexure-B and B1) and the orders passed in the aforesaid cases appointing the petitioner guardian  of  the minors and granting permission to sell the property in question. Clearance Certificate dated 22.8.1974 issued by the Administrative Officer, Mohammadpur and Mirpur Housing Estate (Annexure-B2), deed of sale No. 167 dated 28.12.1974 executed by Salma Begum in favour of the petitioner (Annexure-C), Rent receipts showing payment of rent  (Annexure- C series),  letter dated 25.3.1985 written by the Assistant Commissioner, Settlement asking the petitioner to submit some documents for the purpose of effecting mutation in her name (Annexure-D), inquiry report  dated 9.10.1994 submitted by the Administrative Officer, Mohammadpur Housing Estate confirming the possession of the petitioner in the case property on the basis of purchase (Annexure-D1), and House to House survey  report dated 13.1.1984 finding possession of the petitioner in the property (Annexure-E). All these papers and documents prove that the petitioner has been possessing the case property since her purchase and also the aforesaid documents, particularly the order of the court appointing Salma Begum as guardian  of the minors  and permitting her to sell the property show that the predecessor-in-interest of the petitioner Md. Mahmood and his heirs as well as the present petitioner are all nationals of Bangladesh  and they have always been in possession of the case property. There is nothing on record to suggest that at any point of time did the petitioner and her predecessors-in-interest cease to occupy, supervise and manage the case property in person.<br/><br/>The respondent-Government also does not claim that the petitioner, her vendors and the original lessee Md. Mahmood are nationals of any country other than Bangladesh  which at any time after 25.3.1971 was at war with Bangladesh or that they were not in possession of the case property. Rather, given the facts and circumstances, the very fact of inclusion of the property in the “Kha”list itself establishes to this Court that the petitioner has been in possession  all along and as such the case property in no way answers to the description of abandoned property as  defined in Article 2 of P.O. 16 of 1972 and hence the inclusion of the case property in the “Kha” list is considered and found to be illegal and without jurisdiction.<br/><br/>It is contended further by the petitioner that no notice as contemplated under Section 5(1)(b)  of the Ordinance was served upon the petitioner at any time before listing the property as an abandoned one. Provisions in Section 5(1)(b) of the Ordinance may be looked into which run thus:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“Section 5(i) The Government shall, after the commencement of the Ordinance and before the 31<sup>st</sup> day of December, 1988, publish, from time to time, in the Official Gazette…” (b) Lists of buildings in respect of which notices for surrendering or taking possession as abandoned property under the said Order have been issued.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It is noted that a survey was held in respect of the case property on 17.8.1983 wherein the petitioner was found in possession. In the remark column  of the said report submitted on 13.1.1984 it has been clearly stated that Mrs. Salma Begum @ Salma Mahmud  wife of Md. Mahmood  the original lessee sold out the property to the present occupier Mrs. Sayeda Mohsina and it was  also held that since Mrs. Salma Begum successor of original lessee was residing in V-A/7, Razia Sultana Road. Block –D, Mohammadpur , Dhaka the property may not be treated as an abandoned property. The said survey report clearly recorded the unbroken chain of continuous possession by the petitioner and her predecessors-in-interest of the case property. Admittedly the respondent-Government could not show and produce any paper evidencing the fact of service of any notice upon the petitioner or her predecessors-in-interest under Section 5(1)(b)  of the Ordinance or under Article 7 of P.O. 16 of 1972. This indeed is a condition precedent before enlistment of the property in the “Kha”list of Abandoned Buildings. Article 7(3) of P.O. 16 of 1972 equally clearly requires the issuance of a notice seeking surrender of such property to the Deputy Commissioner or to show cause against such surrender. Relevant provisions of Article 7 read thus:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">7.(1).................................................<br/><em>(2) Where any abandoned property is in possession of any person, such person shall, within seven days of the commencement of this Order, surrender such property to the Deputy Commissioner or the Sub-divisional Magistrate [or the authorised officer.]</em><br/><em>3) Where the person in possession of any abandoned property fails to surrender such property as he is required to do under clause (2), the Deputy Commissioner or the Sub-divisional Magistrate [or the authorised officer] shall serve a notice on him in the prescribed manner requiring him to surrender possession of the property, within seven days of the service of the notice, to the person mentioned in the notice or to show cause against such surrender within the said period and if he fails to do so, the Deputy Commissioner or the Sub-divisional Magistrate [or the authorised officer] shall take possession of the property in such manner as may be prescribed.</em>   </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The aforesaid provisions of Article 7 provide that before the listing of any property in the list of abandoned buildings as a ‘Kha’ list property notice as required by law has to be served upon the occupier of the property. It is not denied rather admitted by the Government that the petitioner is in possession of the case property and she was never disturbed or asked by any notice to surrender possession. Nor did the Government take any step to take over the possession of the same till publication of the Gazette    notification on 23.9.1986.  No notice having been served upon the occupier either under Section 5(1)(b) of the Ordinance or under   Article 7 of P.O. 16 of 1972 , the listing of the case property in the “Kha” list of the abandoned buildings is, therefore, clearly found to be done without lawful authority.<br/><br/>Furthermore, from the papers available in the Records nothing is found to show that the petitioner was ever asked to surrender the possession by any notice. Rather the survey report submitted on 13.1.1984 by the survey team, in this Court’s view, itself substantiates the petitioner’s case of continuous possession of the case property peacefully at all material times.<br/><br/>Apart from this an inquiry was also held in respect of the case property regarding its possession  and the Administrative Officer by a report dated 9.10.1994  clearly recorded the unbroken chain  of continuous possession by the petitioner and her vendors . The contents of the said report are reproduced below –</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>গনপ্রজাতন্ত্রী বাংলাদেশ সরকার,<br/>প্রশাসনিক কর্মকর্তার দপ্তর,<br/>মোহাম্মদপুর হাউজিং এষ্টেট, ঢাকা ।<br/>স্বারকঃ- মিস-২/৯৪/পাট-৩/১১২৮/প্রঃ কঃ    তাং- ৯/১০/৯৪<br/>প্রাপকঃ-  সহকারী কমিশনার, সেটেলমেন্ট,<br/>গৃহায়ন ও গনপূর্ত্ত মমএনালয়,<br/>সেগুনবাগিচা, ঢাকা ।<br/><br/>বিষয়ঃ-   মোহাম্মদপুরসহ ডি ব্লকের ১৩/৪ নং বাড়ীর তদমত প্রতিবেদন ।<br/>সূত্রঃ- ৫৯০৪/১(১)/ক,সে তাং- ২৫/০৬/১৯৯৪ ইং ।<br/>উল্লেখিত বিষয়ে ও সুত্রের প্রেক্ষিতে নিম্ম- স্বাক্ষরকারী জানাইতেছেন যে, মোহাম্মদপুরসহ “ডি” ব্লকের ১৩/৪ নং বাড়ীটির মূল লীজ গ্রহিতা জনাব মোঃ মাহমুদ পিতা মৃত- হাজী জুমরাতী । লীজ দলিল নং- ২৮৯২ তাং- ১১/০৭/৬০ ইং । মূল লীজ গ্রহিতার মৃত্যুর পর তাহার সএী জনাবা সালমা বেগম তাহার নাবালক/নাবালিকা ছেলে মেয়ে যথাত্রুমে (১) জাবেদ মাহমুদ (২) শাকিল মাহমুদ (৩) আরশাদ মাহমুদ (৪) গাজিলা মাহমুদ এর অভিভাবিকা নিযুত্তু হন । জেলা জজ- আদালতের নির্দেশ মোতাবেক । কেস নং- ৪৫১/৭৪। পরবর্তীতে জনাবা সালমা বেগম মাননীয় জেলা জজ, ঢাকা এর আদালতে বাড়ীটির বিত্রুয় অনুমতির জন্য আবেদন করেন যাহার কেস নং ৫৪৬/১৯৭৪ ইং মাধ্যমে আদালতের অনুমতি ত্রুমে তিনি বাড়ীটি জনাবা সৈয়দা মহসিনা, স্বামী জনাব সুফি ইউসুফ এর নিকট সাব-কবলা বিত্রুয় করেন । কবলা দলিল নং ১৬৭ তাং ০৩/০১/৭৫ ইং ।<br/>বাড়ীটির খাতে সরকারী পাওনা কিসিতর টাকা সমুদয় পরিশোধ করা আছে ।<br/>বর্তমানে উল্লেখিত বাড়ীটিতে ত্রেুতা মালিক জনাবা সৈয়দা মহসিনা ও তাহার ভাড়াটিয়াগন বসবাস করিতেছেন ।<br/>অবগতির জন্য প্রেরন করা হইল ।<br/><br/>প্রশাসনিক কর্মকর্তা,<br/>মোহাম্মদপুর হাউজিং এষ্টেট,<br/>ঢাকা ।<br/><u>আউয়াল/</u><br/>তাং- ০৯/১০/৯৪ ইং ।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It is our finding that the Court of Settlement instead of considering all these papers and documents submitted by the claimant in its entirety  most arbitrarily and totally ignoring the  fact of appointment of guardian and permission to sell the property given by the court to Salma Begum arrived at a wholly different and unsubstantiated  finding that ,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>অত্র মোকদ্দমার ঘটনা এবং আইনগত অবসহানে এমনকি নথিসহ সাক্ষীর সাক্ষ্য ও কাগজাদি পর্য্যালোচনায় প্রার্থীনি উল্লেখিত সালমা বেগমের সহিতই মূল মালিক মোঃ মাহমুদের স্বামী-সএী সম্পর্ক ছিল এবং প্রার্থীনির মালিকানা সংত্রুামত Basic documents প্রমানিত হয় নাই । প্রার্থীনির বায়া সালমা বেগম বাংলাদেশ স্বাধীন হওয়ার পর এদেশে ছিলেন এবং এদেশের প্রতি আনুগত্য স্বীকার করিয়াছিলেন  তদসম্পর্কীয় প্রার্থীনিপক্ষ উপযুত্তু কর্তৃপক্ষের দেওয়া নাগরিকত্ব সার্টিফিকেট, আনুগত্য প্রমানের সার্টিফিকেট, ভোটার লিষ্ট কিছুই দাখিল করিয়া প্রমান করেন নাই । বরং প্রার্থীনির বায়া কিংবা তাহার মালিকানার দলিলাদি প্রমানের জন্য যে সকল সাক্ষ্য প্রমান প্রদান করার প্রয়োজন ছিল তাহা উপসহাপন না করায় প্রতিপক্ষ সরকারের মোকদ্দমাটিই প্রমানিত হয় যেহেতু প্রার্থীনির নালিশী সম্পত্তিতে Basic title প্রমানিত হয় নাই । প্রার্থীনির ও তাহার পরিবার পরিজন স্বাধীনতা যুদ্ধের সময় হইতে নালিশী সম্পত্তি বিত্রুয় করা পর্যমত কিংবা এখন পর্যমত এদেশের নাগরিক তদবিষয়টি প্রমানিত হয় নাই । <em>”</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">No explanation has been forthcoming from the respondent-Government as to why such finding may not be struck down as being wholly arbitrary. On the basis of the above quoted finding the Court of Settlement dismissed the case observing that the petitioner has failed to prove her title in the property by producing papers and witnesses.<br/><br/>The said observation of the Court of Settlement in this Court’s view, is absolutely contrary to the facts and circumstances of the present case and documents annexed by the petitioner. The inquiry report and survey reports as above considered conclusively establish that the petitioner has been possessing the case property by purchase from the heirs of the original lessee Md. Mahmood. In the absence of any contrary evidence the aforesaid two reports reinforce the argument that the lessee Md. Mahmood was a citizen and resident of Bangladesh at the material times and that because of the perverse finding of the Court of Settlement this issue totally remained suppressed.<br/><br/>It is also noted  that instead of deciding the question whether the listing of the property as an abandoned one was legally  done , the Court of Settlement in fact virtually decided the title of the petitioner  in the case  property which is not its statutory mandate to do. It is also found that the lessee Md. Mahmood died in Bangladesh leaving his wife Salma Begum, 3 sons and only daughter as his heirs who sold the property to the petitioner by a  deed of 1974 upon due compliance of legal formalities. Nothing has come out from the respondent- Government to establish to the contrary that the said Md. Mahmood  or his heirs were indeed not nationals of Bangladesh. In the case of Syeda Chand Sultana and others Vs. Bangladesh reported in 1 MLR (HCD) 310, which was affirmed by the Appellate Division and  reported in 51 DLR (AD) 24. it has been held that;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“Where the owners as Bangladeshi nationals having lawful title have been in possession of the property althrough and never  having ceased to manage or supervise the same and not having left the country and when there was no proper service of notice upon the petitioners as required under Article 7 of the P.O. no. 16 of 1972, the inclusion of the said building in the “Kha list” of abandoned properties being violative of the fundamental rights as contained in article 42 of the Constitution is illegal, without jurisdiction and of no legal effect and as such the petitioners are entitled to invoke the writ jurisdiction for enforcement of fundamental</em> <em>rights</em>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the present facts and circumstances, this Court finds itself wholly subscribing to that <em>ratio decidendi</em> in the Syeda Chand Sultana Case. <br/><br/>The Court of Settlement without determining the question of facts and law involved in this case unfortunately passed the Judgment without giving a judicial consideration of the whole dispute between the parties and decided the matter erroneously. By that reason this Court arrives at the conclusion that the Court of Settlement’s Judgment and Order dated 19.11.2001 is indeed a perverse one being contrary to the facts, circumstances and evidence on record and as such this Court is inclined to interfere with the impugned Judgment of the Court of Settlement.<br/><br/>Accordingly, this Court finds merit in this application and substance in the Rule Nisi issued.<br/><br/>In the result, the Rule is made absolute, however, without any order as to costs.<br/><br/>The impugned Judgment and Order dated 19.11.2001 (Annexure-F) passed by the First Court of Settlement, Dhaka in Settlement Case No. 32 of 2000 dismissing the case is hereby set aside and the respondent-Government is, hereby, directed to delete/withdraw and rescind the property in question from the “Kha” list published on 23.9. 1986 within 6(six) weeks from the date of receipt of this judgment.<br/><br/>Send down the Records received from the Court of Settlement, Segunbagicha, Dhaka alongwith a copy of this Judgment forthwith.<br/><br/><strong>        Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

At the time of delivering the possession of mortgaged property to the Bank, section 33(7kha) automatically enjoins upon the Adalat to embark on a process of reconfirmation of title as a precondition and necessary prerequisite to handing over possession under Section 33(7Ka). Non-application or keep away in exercise of any authority under Section 57 appears wholly misconceived and illegal. </strong><strong>Misconceived invocation of certain provisions</strong><strong> of the law falls to be quashed under the authority of Certiorari.</strong><br/><br/><em>Like Section 151 of the Code and Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Section 57 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 is a statutory recognition of inherent jurisdiction of the court. This does not confer any power on the court, but it is a statutory recognition of power which the court does have inherently. In this regard, this Court holds that the existence of inherent jurisdiction and statutory recognition of the same will be to no avail unless the courts actively assert and invoke that jurisdiction in fit cases. In the present instance the executing court failed to invoke Section 57 in a clear example of a blatant failure to exercise jurisdiction and that constitutes a valid ground for interference in certiorari.</em>…(13)<br/><br/><em>In the scheme of Section 33 of the Act, the moment a party in the execution proceedings, i.e. the decree holder Bank or financial institution seeks delivery of possession of property further to the Adalat’s active intervention under Section 33(5) or Section 33(7), Section 33(7kha) automatically enjoins upon the Adalat to embark on a process of reconfirmation of title as a precondition and necessary prerequisite to handing over possession under Section 33(7Ka). In other words, the necessity for delivery of possession through court has to arise even before the court can contemplate acting under Section 33(7Kha). In the present facts and circumstances, the court could only guess at such a contingency without a case for possession having been made out as yet by the decree holder bank.</em><strong> </strong>…(16)<br/><br/><em> The entire process of consideration of the Petitioner’s application variously beginning with Order No. 45 of 9.2.2011 continuing through the issuance of Order No. 48 of 9.3.2011 and culminating in the Impugned Order No. 54 dated 29.7.2012 appears to this Court to be tainted by a level of high arbitrariness as amounts to illegality. The postponement or holding in abeyance of exercise of any authority under Section 57 appears wholly misconceived and illegal. The Adalat’s failure to follow up on the Bank’s compliance to Order No. 45 by producing documents appears to be the fatal flow that appears the first on record as evidently the Adalat has waived such compliance for reasons not declared and not readily evident. In Order No. 48 itself there is no cogent reason or ground cited for overriding consideration accorded to a perceived inconvenience to the Bank or to the entire execution proceedings upon the setting aside of the Section 33(5) certificate so far as relates to the Petitioner’s property. Adding to this our findings on the as yet indeterminate possibilities for intervention under Section 33(7kha), there is produced a scenario of an arbitrary exercise of discretion by the Adalat upon a non-consideration of facts, misconception of the law and resultantly asking itself the wrong question in law. That scenario, this Court finds, indeed creates a scope for intervention in Certiorari given that no tribunal has the authority to do wrong or that which is clearly illegal.</em>...(18)<br/><br/><em>Considering these facts and circumstances and the legal positions adopted this Court finds that a postponement of an effective exercise of the Adalat’s jurisdiction under whichever pretext chiefly because of avoidance of exercise of jurisdiction under Section 57, in the facts and circumstances, remains wholly misconceived and illegal and, therefore, merits active intervention by this Court. It is this Court’s reading that such process of postponement and holding in abeyance of exercise of inherent jurisdiction as made an inroad in Order No. 48 met with a natural culmination in the Impugned Order No. 54 dated 29.7.2012 to the extent of requiring the Petitioner in the meantime to disclose how the Respondent No. 3 Bank obtained the title deed to the disputed property. In that regard Order No. 54 also reads as excusing further the Bank to comply with the earlier Order No. 45 of 9.2.2011. Given our findings above, Order No. 54 to that extent must be considered as without lawful authority and of no legal effect and, thereby, liable to be quashed. It is also this Court’s finding that the true genesis of the Order 54 lies in the very terms of Order No. 48 of 9.3.2011. That Order expressly recording the Adalat’s misconceived invocation of certain provisions of the law also fall to be quashed by this Court’s authority under Certiorari. Accordingly, Order No. 48 dated 9.3.2011 as a necessary premise to Order No. 54 is also, hereby, declared to be without lawful authority and to be of no legal effect. </em>…(21)</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/><strong>Mr. Rafique-ul Huq, Senior Advocate with<br/>Mr. Golam Mostafa, Advocate</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 120px;"><strong><em>… For the Added Respondent No. 3</em></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/><strong>Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmood, Senior Advocate with<br/>Mr. S.

Aside from these two broad challenges there are several specific issues of challenge further raised in the Rule issuing Order. Of these, the first challenge to the vires of Section 7 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 (“Act”) has in the course of these proceedings before this Court been withdrawn as not being pressed.<br/><br/>It is noted that Section 7 of the Act has otherwise an ubiquitous presence in the Petitioner’s case generally and in the context has figured prominently in the Petitioner’s submissions in these proceedings. The contention has been of the inadequacy and lack of sufficiency in the issuance of service of notices on the Petitioner as prescribed in Section 7 and enunciated further by principles of common law developed in this jurisdiction. Citing authority being chiefly the Appellate Division’s Judgment in <em>Sonali Bank vs. Prime Global Ltd.,</em> reported in<em> 63 DLR (AD) (2011),99</em> it has been argued that this Court can indeed take judicial notice of the publication of notices in two newspapers that do not permit of categorization as the highest circulating newspapers in this country and consequentially arrive at a finding of non-compliance with the provisions of Section 7(1) of the Act and, thereby, declare the impugned ex parte decree against the Petitioner to be a nullity simply on those grounds.<br/><br/>The Rule issuing Order of itself, however, is declaratory of the fact of the Petitioner looking farther beyond the issue of the legality of that ex parte judgment and decree in the Artha Rin Suit, thereby, taking her well into the execution proceedings where her efforts have been to have declared illegal and without lawful authority the issuance of a certificate under Section 33(5) of the Act. It is in conjunction with this that a specific Order being No. 38 of 20.4.2010 is impugned.<br/><br/>The last component of the Rule issuing Order pertains to Order No. 54 dated 29.7.2012 in Miscellaneous Case No. 15 of 2012 arising out of Artha Rin Suit No. 45 of 2004. The Miscellaneous Case is based on the Petitioner’s invocation of Section 19 read with Section 57 of the Act for setting aside the ex parte Judgment and Decree in Suit No. 45 of 2004. That Case by the impugned Order No. 54, however, came to be summarily rejected on two major grounds. The first pertains to the Adalat’s satisfaction that the notices in Suit No. 45 of 2004 had indeed been published in compliance with Section 7(1). The second reason has to do with an allegation of fraud that has gained prominence in the Petitioner’s response to the execution proceedings. With regard to the latter the Petitioner’s grievance primarily pertains to an onus disproportionately imposed on the Petitioner to establish the Respondent No. 3 Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited’s (“Bank”) embroilment in allegedly fraudulent activities that have led the Petitioner’s property being erroneously shown as being mortgaged to the Bank.<br/><br/>It is the Petitioner’s case that she is neither borrower nor mortgagor nor guarantor of the loan transaction availed by M/S. Dhaka Tag Limited. The Bank impleaded the Petitioner as defendant No. 27 in the suit stating in the plaint that defendant Nos. 22 and 28 are guarantors-mortgagors against the liabilities of defendant No. 1. The Petitioner further states that she did not deposit any title deed to the Bank and never executed any mortgage in favour of the Bank but the Bank by practicing fraud included the name of the Petitioner and her property in the plaint. It is the Petitioner’s assertion to the contrary that the original title deed is lying with One Bank Limited against a loan availed of by Nur Food Products.<br/><br/>It is interesting to note that proceeding well beyond the judgment and decree in the Artha Rin Suit the Petitioner, through sustained efforts at salvaging and protecting her property from the execution proceedings, now finds herself nearly at the very end of an execution exercise in which the arguments for all sides have focused on the relative primacy of Section 57 in juxtaposition with those of Section 33(7ka) and 33(7kha) of the Act read together.<br/><br/>Relying on Section 57 of the Act incorporating the statutory recognition of the Adalat’s inherent jurisdiction to be invoked and relied upon by the Adalat of its own volition in the interest of justice and prevention of abuse of its process, the Petitioner emphatically argues that the execution process has been marred fatally not only because of the Adalat’s failure to appreciate the Petitioner’s sustained efforts at establishing fraud but also of the Adalat’s failure to assert and invoke of itself that inherent jurisdiction in a case as this. Indeed, the Petitioner has gone through a lengthy process of trial and error at the execution stage invoking various provisions of the Act to undo that which has been achieved by the ex parte judgment and decree in Artha Rin Suit No. 45 of 2004.<br/><br/>In that exercise the Petitioner, notably, was not wholly without success before the Adalat. However, her grievance lies in the fact that two processes reflected in a series of Orders that ostensibly favourably considered the merit of the Petitioner’s initiative at unearthing fraud never, however, reached their natural procedural and substantive conclusion. This Court holds that these Orders, though not finding specific mention in the Rule issuing Order, nevertheless, constitute the essential backdrop and, in the Petitioner’s view, the standards against which this Court is asked to gauge, the legality and validity of Order No. 54 dated 29.7.2012. That Order, as earlier noted, pertains both to the issue of notices relating to the Suit itself and that of forgery raised belatedly in the execution proceedings. This Court is of the view that a perusal and substantive consideration of those certain Orders as provide the essential premise for Order No. 54, is unavoidable for a disposal of this Rule in its entirety.<br/><br/>Notably, the issuance of the Section 33(5) certificate under the Impugned Order No. 38 of 24.3.2010 first met with the Petitioner’s challenge through a Section 57 application for setting aside that Order. Order No. 40 of 2.1.2011 records the filing of that application and leads us to the next notable Order being No. 45 of 9.2.2011 by which the executing court directed the Respondent No. 3, Bank to produce papers submitted in the Suit and required status quo to be maintained in respect of possession of the Petitioner’s property. Admittedly, the Bank never complied with that Order and the Adalat appears also to have overlooked such obvious lapse. Order No. 47 of 2.3.2011 records the Petitioner’s sustained  efforts at assist the Adalat at getting to the bottom of the allegation of fraud and records the filing of the Petitioner’s application for a direction upon One Bank, Dhanmondi Branch to produce documents specified in that application. A separate application citing Section 33(7) and 57 of the Act read with Order 21, Rule 90 of the Code of Civil Procedure (“Code”) appears also to have been filed praying for stalling the delivery of possession of the Petitioner’s property and to set aside/recall the certificate under Section 33(5).<br/><br/>These circumstances, the learned Advocate for the Petitioner Mr. Probir Neogi has satisfactorily argued, called for a positive intervention by the Adalat favouring the Petitioner upon an appreciation of the true ambit and nature of the Adalat’s jurisdiction as envisaged in Section 57 of the Act. That, Mr. Neogi submits was an ideal opportunity lost by the Adalat, thereby, contributing irreversibly to the very continuity of the execution proceedings vis-à-vis the Petitioner’s property from that stage onwards. It is also at this juncture that the Adalat, according to Mr. Neogi, erroneously pitted the Section 57 provision against those of Section 33(7Ka) and (7Kha) read together upon a wholly misconceived interpretation of the law. It is Order No. 48 dated 9.3.2011, as a necessary precursor to and almost predetermining the contents of Impugned Order No. 54, that has captured this Court’s attention in this regard. It is deemed pertinent to reproduce in its entirety Order No. 48 as reads thus:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>"দরখাসতকারী দায়িক তার দরখাসেতর সমর্থনে যাবতীয় কাগজপত্র দাখিল করেছে। উত্ত কাগজাদি দৃষ্টে দরখাসতকারীর দাবীকৃত সম্পত্তির ত্রুমিক হসতামতর প্রতিয়মান হয়। তাছাড়া তার নামীয় নামজারী, মহানগর জরীপ খতিয়ান যথার্থই প্রসওত হয়েছে বলে দেখা যায়। সুতরাং উত্তু সম্পত্তিতে দরখাসতকারীর স্বত্বাধিকার প্রতীয়মান হয়। উত্তু সম্পত্তিতে তার বর্তমান দখল আছে বলে শুনানীকালে বিজ্ঞ আইনজীবী প্রকাশ করে। আইনের ৩৩(৭খ) ধারা অনুযায়ী দখল অর্পনের ক্ষেত্রে বন্ধকী দলিল পরীক্ষা করার সুযোগ আছে। দরখাসতকারী বি-২৬ তপসিল সম্পত্তি বন্ধক প্রদান করেনি বলে প্রকাশ করেছে। উল্লেখ্য যে, উচ্চাদালতের সিদ্ধামত অনুযায়ী অর্থঋণ জারী মামলায় সম্পত্তির দখল হসতামতরিত না হওয়া পর্যমত জারী কেস বিচারাধীন থাকে। এই  মামলায় অাদালত মাধ্যমে দখল হসতামতরিত হয়নি। ফলে এই মামলাটি বিচারাধীন আছে। </em><br/><br/><em>দরখাসতকারী ৩৩(৫) ধারা মতে সনদপত্র বাতিলের জন্যও আবেদন করেছে কিমও উত্তু সনদপত্রে অনেকগুলো তফসিল অমতর্ভুত্তু আছে। দরখাসতকারী একটি মাত্র (বি-২৬) তপসিল নিয়ে আবেদন করেছে। সনদটি বাতিল করা হলে সমসত সম্পত্তি বাতিল হয়ে যাবে-যা আদৌ কাম্য নয়। যেহেতু দরখাসতকারী একটি মাত্র তপসিল নিয়ে দাবী করেছে এবং যেহেতু অনেকগুলো তপসিল নিয়ে সনদপত্র ইস্যু করা হয়েছে; সেহেতু তপসিল বর্ণিত সনদটি বাতিল করা যুত্তিুযুত্তু নয়। সে কারণে ৩৩(৫) ধারা মোতাবেক প্রদত্ত সনদপত্রটি বাতিলের আবেদন যুত্তিুযুত্তু নয় বলে সেটি নাকচ করা হলো। তবে বি-২৬ নং তপসিল সম্পত্তিতে ডিত্রুীদারের দখল গ্রহণের নিষেধ আদেশের বিষয়টি বিবেচনা করা যেতে পারে। কিমও যখন ডিত্রুীদার উত্তু সম্পত্তি দখল গ্রহণ আদালত মাধ্যমে প্রার্থনা করবে তখন বি-২৬ নং তপসিল সম্পত্তিতে বন্ধকী দলিল আইনানুযায়ী যাচাই বাছাইকালে বিষয়টি পর্যালোচনা করার সুযোগ থাকবে। ডিত্রুীদার বি-২৬ নং তপসিলের দখল গ্রহনের আবেদন করলে আইনের ৩৩(৭খ) ধারা অনুযায়ী পকৃত মালিক বন্ধক প্রদান করেছিল কিনা সেটি পরীক্ষা করা হবে।''</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The positive view taken of the Petitioner’s claim and allegations appear, however, not to have translated into the Adalat’s active intervention under Section 57 given the declared inadvisability of disrupting the execution proceedings at that stage and the perceived fallback measures then still available under Section 33(7kha) of the Act. Evidently while the Adalat did not outright decline jurisdiction and authority to probe into the allegation of fraud it, nevertheless, for reasons of overwhelming consideration of facts of overriding significance cited by it, deemed fit to postpone or hold in abeyance an exercise of probing into that allegation contingent upon coming into play of a Section 33(7kha) scenario. It is here, Mr. Neogi has argued, that the Adalat asked itself the wrong question in law. He submits that on 9.3.2011 in view of its own findings reflected in Order No. 48 the Adalat was under a legal obligation to forthwith grant relief prayed for by the Petitioner under Section 57 of the Act and not defer it until a Section 33(7kha) contingency arising. That preference shown for exercise of authority under Section 33(7kha), this Court finds, is flawed variously. While Section 57 remains a declaration of the statutory recognition of power inherently reposed in the Adalat and exercisable in extremely broad terms for the ends of justice and preventing abuse of process, Section 33(7kha) in contradistinction speaks of a conferment of power by no means unlimited in its intended ambit, but the statutorily declared periphery of which are yet to be firmly established either through practice or declared by Rules formulated. In other words, the Adalat, it is found, showed a preference for navigating through unchartered territory reflected in Section 33(7kha) by wholly abdicating its statutory responsibility to draw on its overarching, ready and available inherent powers by reference to Section 57. There is nothing on record establishing why the Adalat so opted to adopt such a precarious position.<br/><br/>This Court holds that like Section 151 of the Code and Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Section 57 is a statutory recognition of inherent jurisdiction of the court. This does not confer any power on the court, but it is a statutory recognition of power which the court does have inherently. In this regard, this Court holds that the existence of inherent jurisdiction and statutory recognition of the same will be to no avail unless the courts actively assert and invoke that jurisdiction in fit cases. In the present instance the executing court failed to invoke Section 57 in a clear example of a blatant failure to exercise jurisdiction and that constitutes a valid ground for interference in certiorari.<br/><br/>Section 33(7kha) appears on the face of it, as yet, indeterminate in its scope to the extent of delivery of possession of property to the claimant owner and indeed no consequence is expressed therein in the event that the executing court does not reconfirm that the property in question was indeed mortgaged by the real owner against the loan in question.<br/><br/>The problem faced here is the allusion in Section 33(7Kha) to a formalized structured proceeding before a court not, however, benefiting either from supporting provisions in the Act itself or notably from Rules of procedure that could and ought to have been framed by authority of Section 58 of the Act especially upon writing the provisions of Section 33(7Ka) <em>and</em> 33(7Kha) into the law by amendments introduced in 2010. That exercise under Section 58 clearly still remains outstanding.  It is noted further that Section 33(7Kha) is of mandatory application only when Section 33(7Ka) is invoked and these two provisions read pertinently thus:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“</em><em>৩৩।(৭ক) উপ-ধারা (৫) বা (৭) এর অধীন সম্পত্তির দখল আদালতযোগে প্রাপ্ত হওয়া আবশ্যক হইলে, ডিত্রুীদারের লিখিত আবেদনের ভিত্তিতে আদালত ডিত্রুীদারকে সম্পত্তির দখল অর্পণ করিতে পারিবে। </em><br/><em>(৭খ) উপ-ধারা (৭ক) এর অধীন ডিত্রুীদারকে সম্পত্তির দখল অর্পণ করিবার পূর্বে আদলতে পুনঃনিশ্চিত হইতে হইবে যে, উত্তু সম্পত্তিই আইনানুগভাবে উহার প্রকৃত মালিক কর্তৃক ডিত্রুীর সংশ্লিষ্ট ঋণের বিপরীতে বন্ধক প্রদান করা হইয়াছিল অথবা ডিত্রুী কার্যকর করিবার লক্ষ্যে দায়িকের প্রকৃত স্বত্ব দখলীয় সম্পত্তি হিসাবে উত্তু সম্পত্তিই ত্রেুাক করা হইয়াছিল।</em><em>”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the scheme of Section 33 of the Act, the moment a party in the execution proceedings, i.e. the decree holder Bank or financial institution seeks delivery of possession of property further to the Adalat’s active intervention under Section 33(5) or Section 33(7), Section 33(7kha) automatically enjoins upon the Adalat to embark on a process of reconfirmation of title as a precondition and necessary prerequisite to handing over possession under Section 33(7Ka). In other words, the necessity for delivery of possession through court has to arise even before the court can contemplate acting under Section 33(7Kha). In the present facts and circumstances, the court could only guess at such a contingency without a case for possession having been made out as yet by the decree holder bank.<br/><br/>It is here that Mr. Neogi submits that the issues generated by the Petitioner’s grievance as first agitated before the Adalat and now placed before us do not fall in any manner to be considered under Section 33(7kha). Therefore, there remained nothing to be achieved under an anticipated Section 33(Kha) process in terms of evaluating the validity of the decree and that of the adequacy of notices issued and served and, therefore, of setting aside the decree or the eventual sale. In other words, these questions mooted throughout the execution process at the Petitioner’s behest would potentially continue to be outstanding <em>ad infinitum</em> without promise of a legal closure if the Adalat insistently relied exclusively on Section 33(7kha) in declared preference to Section 57 and ignoring the primacy of the application of Section 57 in the circumstances. Therefore, at the end of the day, all that Order No. 48 assures the Petitioner is a mere retention of the possession of her property and precious little otherwise substantially. Indeed the Petitioner’s attempt once more to remind the Adalat of its inherent authority to probe both into the issue of notices and the fraudulent mortgage produced the Impugned Order No. 54 of 29.7.2012.<br/><br/>The entire process of consideration of the Petitioner’s application variously beginning with Order No. 45 of 9.2.2011 continuing through the issuance of Order No. 48 of 9.3.2011 and culminating in the Impugned Order No. 54 dated 29.7.2012 appears to this Court to be tainted by a level of high arbitrariness as amounts to illegality. The postponement or holding in abeyance of exercise of any authority under Section 57 appears wholly misconceived and illegal. The Adalat’s failure to follow up on the Bank’s compliance to Order No. 45 by producing documents appears to be the fatal flow that appears the first on record as evidently the Adalat has waived such compliance for reasons not declared and not readily evident. In Order No. 48 itself there is no cogent reason or ground cited for overriding consideration accorded to a perceived inconvenience to the Bank or to the entire execution proceedings upon the setting aside of the Section 33(5) certificate so far as relates to the Petitioner’s property. Adding to this our findings on the as yet indeterminate possibilities for intervention under Section 33(7kha), there is produced a scenario of an arbitrary exercise of discretion by the Adalat upon a non-consideration of facts, misconception of the law and resultantly asking itself the wrong question in law. That scenario, this Court finds, indeed creates a scope for intervention in Certiorari given that no tribunal has the authority to do wrong or that which is clearly illegal.<br/><br/>Between the Respondent No. 3 Bank and the added Respondent No. 4 auction-purchaser this Court has found the former understandably better placed to submit on the issue of fraud in this case. It is noted that the learned Advocate for the Respondent Bank, Mr. Rafique-ul-Huq has acknowledged the presence of fraud in the mortgage process but has nevertheless seen merit in the Adalat’s persistent reliance on Section 33(7kha). Indeed, Mr. Huq has submitted that it is open to the Adalat under Section 33(7kha) to undo the issuance of Section 33(5) certificate, as need be. For reasons as above elaborated, this Court is unable to concur with Mr. Rafique-ul Huq’s view of a primacy of application of Section 33(7kha).<br/><br/>The added Respondent No. 4 auction- purchaser represented by the learned Advocate Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmood and Mr. Rashed Jahangir have in relation to Order No. 48 submitted that the Petitioner’s failure to actively challenge that Order tantamount to her tacit acceptance of the course of action embarked upon by the Adalat consequentially. Messrs Mahmud and Jahangir submit that the effect of Section 57 pales in comparison to Section 33(7kha) merely because the Adalat itself in Order No. 48 clothes itself with the authority to consider the Petitioner’s contention and, thereby, examine the mortgage deed or relevant instrument only at the time of handing over possession. Accordingly, they agree that the Adalat aptly kept the matter for disposal under Section 33(kha). By that reason, the Adalat’s Order being apparently regular on the face of it and the Petitioner conceivably not being aggrieved by it, the prayer of the Respondent No. 4 is for this Court to refrain from intervening in Certiorari or otherwise. Indeed, it is additionally argued that both the matter of the adequacy or not of the issuance and service of notices and that of fraud are fraught with the dangers of this Court being asked to probe into highly disputed questions of fact which this Court is ill-equipped to undertake in exercise of summary jurisdiction.<br/><br/>Considering these facts and circums-tances and the legal positions adopted this Court finds that a postponement of an effective exercise of the Adalat’s jurisdiction under whichever pretext chiefly because of avoidance of exercise of jurisdiction under Section 57, in the facts and circumstances, remains wholly misconceived and illegal and, therefore, merits active intervention by this Court. It is this Court’s reading that such process of postponement and holding in abeyance of exercise of inherent jurisdiction as made an inroad in Order No. 48 met with a natural culmination in the Impugned Order No. 54 dated 29.7.2012 to the extent of requiring the Petitioner in the meantime to disclose how the Respondent No. 3 Bank obtained the title deed to the disputed property. In that regard Order No. 54 also reads as excusing further the Bank to comply with the earlier Order No. 45 of 9.2.2011. Given our findings above, Order No. 54 to that extent must be considered as without lawful authority and of no legal effect and, thereby, liable to be quashed. It is also this Court’s finding that the true genesis of the Order 54 lies in the very terms of Order No. 48 of 9.3.2011. That Order expressly recording the Adalat’s misconceived invocation of certain provisions of the law also fall to be quashed by this Court’s authority under Certiorari. Accordingly, Order No. 48 dated 9.3.2011 as a necessary premise to Order No. 54 is also, hereby, declared to be without lawful authority and to be of no legal effect.<br/><br/>Our findings above, therefore, leaves the Petitioner with a scenario where her status is restored <em>ante quo</em> to the date on which the executing court was reposed of the authority and jurisdiction under Section 57 to consider her application as mentioned and recorded in Order Nos. 40 of 2.1.2011, 45 of 9.2.2011 and 47 of 2.3.2011. That should concomitantly read as a revival with immediate effect of the Bank’s obligation owed to the executing court to produce all papers submitted in the original suit pertaining to the mortgage of the Petitioner’s property and the maintenance of status quo in respect of the Petitioner’s property until such time as the Petitioner’s applications are substantively disposed of. In other words, the Petitioner shall finding herself in the same position as she was on 9.3.2011 when, but for the now quashed Order No. 48, she would be awaiting a consideration of all applications under Section 57 of the Act read with any other relevant provision. That said, the Petitioner is, however, put on notice of the fact that Impugned Order No. 54 so far as relates to the adequacy of notices published in terms of Section 7(1) of the Act and, thereby, setting aside of the decree in Suit No. 45 of 2004 merit no intervention by this Court given that the Adalat found on delay aptly operating against the Petitioner under Section 19(2) of the Act. The law of its own force having thus applied and operated against the Petitioner we find no reason to intervene in so far as quashing and setting aside the Judgment and Decree dated 19.7.2006 is concerned.<br/><br/>Furthermore, by reason of our findings and observations above it now remains for the executing court itself to revisit and rediscover its authority under Section 57 of the Act with a view to disposing of the Petitioner’s applications chiefly of the cancellation of the Section 33(5) certificate issued under Order No. 38 of 24.3.2010. By that reason, this Court refrains from intervening in the manner as prayed for vis-à-vis these Impugned Orders leaving the executing court to be the arbiter for the time being of the fate of that certificate. In this instance as well there is found no ground to quash presently Order No. 38 dated 20.4.2010.<br/><br/>Given the tenor of our findings above, this Court now, hereby, directs the Artha Rin Adalat presently in seisin of Execution Case No. 46 of 2007 to revisit Order Nos. 40, 45 and 47 and proceed strictly in terms of those Orders applying the relevant provisions of the law and predominantly exercising its authority under Section 57 of the Act repeatedly invoked and appealed to by the Petitioner. That process of consideration and final disposal of the applications substantively shall not under any circumstances extend beyond the period of 3 (three) months computed from date of receipt by the executing court of this Judgment and Order.<br/><br/>It shall be incumbent upon the Respondent No. 3 Bank, in particular, to extend all co-operation to the Adalat in this regard bearing in mind the terms in which Order No. 45 of 9.2.2011 has been issued and itself attaches to the Bank specifically.<br/><br/>In the result, the Rule is disposed of with the findings, observations and directions above.<br/><br/>The Order of status quo as reflected in Order No. 45 dated 9.2.2011 shall continue until the final disposal of the Petitioner’s application as above directed.<br/><br/>There is no Order as to costs.<br/><br/>Communicate this Order at once.<br/><br/><strong>        Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Ziaul Karim, J:</u></strong></span><br/> <br/>This reference under Section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (briefly as the Code) has been made by learned Judge of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal no.1, Rangpur (briefly as Tribunal), for confirmation of death sentence of condemned-prisoner.<br/><br/>By the above appeals the appellant has challenged the legality and propriety of the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 29-06-2006 passed by learned Judge of Tribunal in Nari-O-Shishu Case no. 328 of 2001 convicting the appellant under Section 6(1) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain, 1995 (briefly as Ain 1995) and sentencing him to death by hanging.<br/><br/>This death reference and all these appeals having arisen out of a common judgment, these have been heard together and are being disposed of by this judgment.<br/><br/>The prosecution case as projected in first information report (briefly as FIR) and unfurled at trial are that Most. Sahejan Begum (14½) daughter of informant Md. Sahidul (P.W.1) appeared in S.S.C. examination 2000 from Bujruk Santushpur Ideal High School. On 17-03-2000 at 8:00 a.m. she disclosed that accused Mominur Islam used to molest her on the way to her school and repeatedly proposed for marriage. On her refusal she was threatened to be defiled. On 08-01-2000 at 7:00 p.m. accused entered into her dwelling hut in absence of her parents and committed rape against her will. She did not disclose such incident for the fear of her life but consequently she was carrying for four months on such affairs. The accused also promised to marry her but to no avail. To that effect a salish was held on 20-03-2000 wherein she narrated such melancholie episode, but accused disowned it. Eventually the members of board of Salish directed the accused to marry her within seven days. Later, the accused without giving effect of it fled away. With these allegations the prosecution was launched by lodging a FIR by her father Sahidul (P.W.1) as informant which was recorded as Mithapukur Police Station case no. 20 dated 15-06-2000 corresponding to G.R. no. 320 of 2000.<br/><br/>During pendency of the case victim died. The Police after investigation submitted charge sheet under section 9(1) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain 2000 accusing the accused Md. Mominur Islam.<br/><br/>Eventually, charge under section 6(1) of the Ain 1995 was framed against accused in his absence. Later, trial was held in absentia, and he was defended by State defence lawyer.<br/><br/>In course of trial the prosecution in all examined seven witnesses out of eleven charge sheeted witnesses.<br/><br/>The defence case as it appears from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses are that of innocence and false implication. It was divulged in defence that by creating some fictitious papers he was falsely implicated by his rivals.<br/><br/>After trial in absentia the accused was convicted as aforesaid.<br/><br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the State supports the reference and submits that accused himself admitted his guilt before salish which can be treated as his extra judicial confession and the same was corroborated by other independent witnesses. He adds that victim categorically disclosed that she was raped by accused, consequently she was carrying which was proved by doctor in ultra sonogram report. Therefore, the Tribunal after considering the materials on record rightly convicted the accused which calls for no interference by this Court. In support of his contentions he refers the case of Saidur Rahman Neuton and others Vs. State 45 DLR-66 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“<em> Question of corroboration. It has long been a rule of practice for insisting on corroboration of the statement of the prosecutrix. If the Judge feels that without corroboration in a particular case the conviction can be sustained then he should give indication that he had the rule of caution in his mind and then should proceed to give reasons for considering it unnecessary to require corroboration and for considering that it was safe to convict the accused without corroboration.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>He next refers the case of State Vs. Sadek Matbar and others 13 MLR 591 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“<em>Extra judicial confession can be acted upon when it is found to be true and is corroborated in material particulars by independent witnesses and the fact that such confessions is subsequently retracted is immaterial.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The learned Counsels appearing for the condemned prisoner by their common contentions seek to impeach the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence on five fold arguments:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong><u>Firstly:</u></strong> The alleged extra Judicial confession can not be treated at all be an admission of guilt and the same was not proved by evidence. In support of their contention they refer the case of The State Vs. Mofazzal Hossain Pramanik 43 DLR (AD) 65 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“Admission- its evidentiary value-A statement when sought to be used as an admission of its maker, must be clear and definite leaving no doubt about its content. A vague statement or one which is capable of different interpretations, is not an admission. Letter written by one brother to another regarding transfer of shares, which is not clear in its meaning and definite in its intention cannot be accepted as an admission. For a statement to be used as admission against the person making it, it is not necessary that he must have prior knowledge that it might be used against him. The letter written from Calcutta and received at Dhaka does not indicate that there was any agreement between the two brothers that the statement therein was not to be used as evidence in court in future. The letter does not therefore attract the prohibition of section 23.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong><u>Secondly-</u></strong> The case is absolutely a case of no evidence.<br/><br/><strong><u>Thirdly:</u></strong>  There is no prosecutrix in this case, prosecution relied on hearsay evidence, which cannot be the basis of conviction. In support of their contention they refer the case of Masud Mia (Md) Vs. State 56 DLR-352 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><strong>“</strong> <em>In a case of rape where there is no independent eye-witness to the occurrence and the only evidence is that of the prosecutrix and of those to whom the story of rape was reported, the Court is not left with any objective standard for gauging the truth of the prosecution story. The evidence of the prosecution there needs close scrutiny.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong><u>Fourthly:</u></strong> The Tribunal convicted the accused considering the abscondence of accused, but abscondence is never be an inference of guilt.<br/><br/><strong><u>Fifthly:</u></strong> The Judgment and order of conviction and sentence based on misreading and non consideration of evidence on record which cannot be sustained in the eye of law.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In order to appreciate their submissions we have gone through the record and given our anxious consideration to their submissions.<br/><br/>Let us now weigh and sift the evidence on record as adduced by the prosecution to prove the charge.<br/><br/>P.W.1 Shahidul is informant and father of victim. He deposed that on 08-01-2000 at 7:00 p.m. the accused Mominur by entering into his south facing house forcibly committed rape upon his daughter Sahejan. On 17-03-2000 his daughter disclosed about his sickness and she was weeping. On quarry she narrated the fact to the effect that accused Mominur by entering into his living room forcibly committed rape on the point of a dagger. On 20-03-2000 a salish was held wherein the accused by admitting his guilt promised to marry her within seven days but with no effect. His daughter became pregnant for the cause of rape and she was examined by doctor. He lodged the FIR. He proved the same as Exhbt. 1 and his signature on it 1/1.<br/><br/>After occurrence his daughter died by heart failure leaving behind one child aged about three years.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that at the time of occurrence they were not present in their home. He denied the suggestion that the accused never visited his house and raped his daughter.<br/><br/>P.W. 2 Most. Santana Begum wife of informant and mother of victim. She deposed that on 17-03-2000 at 8:00 p.m. she found her daughter sick who told that on 08-01-2000 at 7:00 p.m. accused Mominur raped her in their absence. On 20-03-2000 accused Mominur admitted his guilt in salish and promised to marry her daughter within seven days. Her daughter was carrying for about four months. Her daughter died on hearing the information of marriage of accused.<br/><br/>In cross-examination she stated that she did not see the occurrence. On 17-03-2000 she heard the occurrence. In Eid-ul-Fitr she was present. She denied the suggestion that there was a land dispute between them and deposing falsely.<br/><br/>P.W. 3 Azimuddin alias Md. Azimuddin a local witness. He deposed that in salish he heard that the victim was raped. The accused admitted his guilt that he impregnated her. Consequently one child born. The victim died by heart failure on hearing the information of marriage of accused.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that in salish both the victim and accused admitted the occurrence.<br/><br/>P.W. 4, Abul Kasem a rural physician. He deposed that on 20-03-2000 a salish was held wherein he heard the occurrence. Victim stated that she was raped by accused. The accused also admitted his guilt and signed in a paper before the salish. It was decided that within seven days the accused will marry the victim but subsequently he did not do so.  The victim died by heart failure on hearing marriage of accused. He proved the salishnama as Exhbt. 2 and his signature on it as Exhbt. 2/1.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that he heard the occurrence and denied the suggestion that there was a land dispute between the parties. The victim was not raped and deposing falsely.<br/><br/>P.W. 5, Momdel Hossain a local witness. He deposed that at the time of salish he heard the occurrence. He proved his signature on salishnama as Exhbt. 2/2.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he stated that about two hundred people assembled in salish. The victim told them she was raped on 08-01-2000 at 7:00 p.m. He denied the suggestion that there was a land dispute between the parties, the victim was not raped and deposing falsely.<br/><br/>P.W. 6 S.I. Md. Abdul Halim alias Md. Abul Halim Sarker deposed that on 15-06-2000 he was attached with Mithapukur Police Station. The Case was entrusted to him for investigation. He visited the place of occurrence, prepared sketch map and index (4,4/1). He recorded the statements of the witnesses under Section 161 of the Code. Victim was examined by doctor and after investigation submitted charge sheet accusing the accused.<br/><br/>In cross-examination he denied the suggestion that he recorded the statements in the Police station and submitted a perfunctory report.<br/><br/>P.W.7 Doctor Mir Hamde Swami Azad deposed that on 20-06-2000 Doctor Afsana Ferdous held ultra sonogram of victim Sahejan Begum and prepared a report. He proved the same as Exhbt. 5 and his signature on it as Exhbt.5/1. The contents of report are as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“<em> Uterus is gravid contains single fetus, Gestational age is about 25 weeks as calculated from BPD 65 mm &amp; 44 mm. Fetal heart movement is present &amp; regular. Amniotic fluid is optimum in amount. Placenta is anterior low-lying.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>Comments: about 25 weeks of viable single pregnancy low lying placenta”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>These are all of the evidence on record adduced by the prosecution to prove the charge.<br/><br/>It is indisputable that victim Shahejan Begum (since dead) was raped.<br/> <br/>On going to the materials on record it transpires that prosecution in all examined seven witnesses out of eleven charge sheeted witnesses. Of whom, P.W.1 is the informant and father of victim. P.W.3, 4 and 5 are the local witnesses and heard the occurrence in salish, of them P.W. 4 proved the salishnama, P.W. 6 investigated the case and submitted charge sheet. P.W. 7 proved the report of ultra sonogram furnished by Dr. Afsana Ferdous.<br/> <br/>We should bear in mind, credibility of testimony oral and circumstantial, depends considerably on a judicial evaluation of the totality, not isolated scrutiny. When dealing with the serious question of guilt or innocence of persons charged with crime, the following principles should be taken into consideration.<br/>a)   The onus of proving everything essential to the establishment of the charge against the accused lies on the prosecutor.<br/>b)   The evidence must be such asto exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.<br/>c)   In matters of doubt it is safer to acquit than to condemn, for it is better that several guilty persons should escape than that one innocent person suffer.<br/>d)    There must be clear and unequivocal proof of the corpus delicit.<br/>e)   The hypothesis of delinquency should be consistent with all the facts proved.<br/> <br/>Inspite of the presumption of truth attached to oral evidence under oath if the Court is not satisfied, the evidence inspite of oath is of no avail.<br/> <br/>It is true that there is no eye witness in this case but the prosecution case absolutely rest upon the statement of victim and extra-Judicial confession of accused.<br/> <br/>For the convenience of understanding statement of victim as given in Salish (Exhbt.2) reads as hereunder:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"" মোছাঃ শাহেজানের জবানবন্দি -<br/>গত রোজার ২/৩ তারিখে  আমি স্কুল যাওয়ার পথে বিবাদী মমিনুর আমাকে একখানা চিঠি দেয়। আমি উহা প্রত্যাখান করিয়া স্কুলে যাই ও নিয়মিত  ফিরে আসি। অতঃপর কয়েক দিনের মধ্যে বিবাদী আমাকে যখন তখন বিরও্র করে ও বিবাহ  করার প্রস্তাব দেয়। আমি গরীবের মেয়ে হিসাবে  মমিনুরকে বারংবার প্রত্যাখান করি। গত রমজান মাসের শেষ দিন ৮/১/২০০০ ইং রোজ শনিবার  দিবাগত রাতে আমার মা বাবা ঘরোয়া আলাপ অালোচনার জন্য পার্শ্ববতী জেঠার  বাড়ীতে যাওয়ার সুযোগে  মাগরিব পর রাত ৭ টার সময় মমিনুর আমার দক্ষিন দোয়ারী শয়ন  ঘরে প্রবেশ করিয়া অামাকে ধরিতে আসে। আমি বিপদ বুঝিয়া  চিৎকার দিতে গেলে মমিনুর আমাকে ছোরা দেখিয়ে ভয় দেখায় ও মুখ চেপে  ধরে বিছানায়  ফেলে পায়জামার ফিতা ছিঁড়ে উলঙ্গ করে জোরপূর্বক আমার ইচছার বির্রদ্ধে আমাকে ধর্ষণ করে। ফলে বর্তমানে আমি অন্তসত্তা। ঘটনার  পর সমাজ ভয়ে বিবাদী মমিনুরের পূর্ব কথামত তার সাথে বিবাহে রাজী হইতে বাধ্য হই  এবং সেও আমাকে বিবাহ করিতে রাজী হয় ও শপথ করে। পরবর্তীতে বিবাদী মমিনুর আমাকে বিবাহ করিতে অস্বীকার করিলে  আমি আপনাদের সরনাপন্ন হইয়া বিচার প্রার্থনা করিতেছি।<br/>সভাপতি  সাহেব মোছাঃ  সাহেজানের  সাক্ষীর কথা জিজ্ঞাসা করিলে সে মমিনুরের  প্রদত্ত চিঠি ও ছবির কথা বলে ও সেগুলি সভাসহলে সভাপতির নিকট হস্তান্তর করে।<br/>স্বাক্ষর সাহেজান বেগম-সাহেজন"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Furthermore the extra-Judicial confession of accused runs in following manner:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"বিবাদী  মমিনুরের জবানবন্দি-<br/>আমি শাহেজনকে  কোন রুপ বিরক্ত করি নাই বা চিঠি দেই নাই এবং তার কোন ক্ষতিও করি নাই। সে বা তার বাবা আক্রোশ মূলক আমাকে অহেতুক দোষারোপ করিতেছে।<br/>বিবাদীর জবানবন্দির উপর ভিত্তি করিয়া সভাপতি সাহেব বিবাদীর প্রদত্ত চিঠি ও ছবি আমাকে দেখাইলে সে তখন ছবিও চিঠি নিজের বলিয়া অকপটে  স্বীকার করে ও শাহেজানের  সহিত অতীত কর্মকান্ড সম্পর্কে  বিস্তারিত স্বীকার করে z<br/>স্বাক্ষর-  মমিনুর- মমিনুর z<em>”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>After considering their statements members board of salish pronounced the following verdict:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em> “ </em>সালিশ বোর্ড অত্র সালিশের বাদী , বিবাদীর জবানবন্দি ও সাক্ষ্য প্রমানের ভিত্তিতে বিবেচনা  সাপেক্ষে ,বিবাদীকে দোষী সাব্যস্ত করেন এবং সমস্যা  সমাধানের  লক্ষে ইসলামী শরিয়ত  ও সামাজিক বিধান মতে বিবাদী মোঃ মমিনুর ইসলামকে বাদী ছাইদুলের কন্যা  মোছাঃ  সাহেজন  বেগমকে আগামী সাত দিনের মধ্যে বিবাহ করার জন্য রায় প্রদান করেন।<br/>সভাপতি<br/>মোঃ আবুল কাশেম<br/>২০-৩-২০০০ ইং<br/>৬নং ওয়ার্ড সদস্য<br/>১৩ নং বালুয়া  মাসিমপুর  ইউ,পি, মিঠাপুকুর, রংপুর <em>”</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">On appraisal of evidence on record it transpires that P.W.1 Sahidul father of victim stated that he heard the incident from victim on 17-03-2000 that she was raped by accused on 08-01-2000 at 7:00 p.m. at their south facing dwelling hut in their absence. The victim was also carrying for four months due to such affairs. On 20-03-2000, a salish was held, wherein the members of board of salish after hearing the statements of victim and admission of guilt of accused, directed the accused to marry the victim within seven days but with no effect, rather the accused fled away. PWs. 2-5 were examined to corroborate the evidence of PW-1. They categorically stated that they heard the occurrence in salish that the accused admitted his guilt, but on close analysis of the statement, it indicate that the accused disowned all allegations. So the evidence of all PWs suffer from glaring, contradictions inconsistencies and infirmities. So, the same are vulnerable to the credibility and it is very unsafe to believe their testimonies.<br/> <br/>In the case reported in 1990 Criminal Law Journal 385(P &amp; H ) held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“An extra judicial confession is usually looked upon as a week type of evidence and therefore whenever it is sought to be relied upon, the burden lies upon the prosecution to show  its trustworthiness. In order to under such confession worthy of belief regard must be had to (i) the present to whom it was made, (ii) to the connection, if any, of the accused with him, (iii) the occasion or reason for the accused to go and make such a confession to him and (iv) the circumstances in which it was made. Besides all these, the extra-judicial confession must be considered in the overall context of the prosecution case and the evidence on record.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of State Vs. Hasen Ali 4 BLC 582 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“ Extra-judicial confession- The PWs 7,9 and 11 having failed to state the exact words of extra judicial confession as alleged to have been made by condemned prisoner cannot be relied upon in the absence of exact words used by the accused person getting aid of corroborative circumstantial evidence,” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of State Vs. Mozam alias Mozammel and others 9 BLC 163 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“<em> Extra-judicial confession is a very week piece of evidence. It can never form the basis of the conviction of the accused unless the actual words of the accused person making the confession is brought on record and such a confession finds reliable corroboration. Courts have always treated extra-judicial confession as suspicious evidence and cautioned against its acting in the absence of corroborative evidence. In the instant case the PWs 1, 2 and 3 adduced evidence regarding extra- judicial confession but their evidence is contradictory.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of State Vs. Moslem 55 DLR 128 wherein at paragraph 57 it has been observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“<em> It is emphasised that an Extra-judicial confession undoubtedly is an evidence of weak nature but it must be, also , borne in mind that in terms of section 24 of The Evidence Act a conviction can, also, be rested on Extra-Judicial confession, subject of course to the fact that such statements are corroborated by other materials on record. Recovery of body remains and wearing apparels of victim Salma on pointing out by condemned prisoner following Extra-Judicial confession is a definite indication that the confession got a ring of truth and it serves to be acted upon. In the case in hand the circumstance evidence got corroboration from evidence of Extra-Judicial confession or likewise Extra-Judicial confession got corroboration from circumstantial evidence.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Moreso, the salishnama (Exhbt. 2) was not proved by evidence inasmuch as none of members of board of salish came forward to prove the same. Exhbt. 2 was proved by PW-4 Abul Kasem, a rural physician, who merely assembled in salish along with other co-villagers and his name stands as witness no.6 in charge-sheet, but Abul Kasem Paiker was the Union Parishad member and Chairman of board of salish, his name stands as witness no.9 in charge-sheet, but he was not examined by the prosecution without explanation. Therefore we hold that salishnama (Exhbt. 2) is in- admissible in evidence and should be left out of consideration.<br/> <br/>It is true that crime like rape is shocking in nature and also, revolting. The Crime is against Society and humanity, but the prosecution convicted the accused merely on suspicion that the accused committed rape. There cannot be conviction for rape on mere suspicion or presumption. The commission of rape must be proved. The presumption cannot take the place of positive evidence, (1970 P. Crl.L.J.-166).<br/> <br/>It further appears to us that the instant case is absolutely a case of no evidence but the Court below without any legal evidence convicted the accused in moral view. Legal evidence in a criminal trial is the evidence of the incriminating facts and circumstances of involvement of the accused in the commission of offence inevitable pointing to their guilty as the perpetrators incompatible with the plea of their innocence. In view of the proved facts and circumstances of the present case which do not constitute any legal evidence moral conviction should not be substituted in place of the legal evidence.<br/> <br/>The accused was convicted merely on suspicion without any legal evidence. To that end in view, law is now well settled that suspicion or doubt however strong it might be cannot take place of evidence or there be slightest doubt asto the involvement of the accused in the crime, he cannot be convicted. With this regard reliance are being placed in the cases of Abdul Haq and others Vs. The State 14 BLT 485, Fazu alias Fazlur Rahman Vs. The State 1 BLC 558, Rekatfullah Vs. The State 13 DLR-750. It is further held in the case reported in AIR 1921 (PC) 69, that the decision of the Court must rest upon legal ground established by legal testimony from the prosecution.<br/> <br/>Moreso in all respect, the convict is also entitled to benefit of doubt. In the case of Safder Ali Vs. Crown 5 DLR(FC) 107 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“<em>  In a criminal case, it is the duty of the Court to review the entire evidence that has been produced by the prosecution and the defence. If, after an examination of the whole evidence, the Court is of the opinion that there is a reasonable possibility that the defence put forward by the accused might be true, it is clear that such a view reacts on the whole prosecution case. In these circumstances, the accused is entitled to benefit of doubt, not as a matter of grace, but as of right, because the prosecution has not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>So, there is no cogent, convincing and unimpeachable evidence on record to prove the complicity of the accused with the crime of rape. Prosecution utterly failed to bring home guilt to the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<br/>It is pertinent to point out that as the accused remained absconding so the trial was held in absentia but after pronouncement of judgment he surrendered and preferred appeal before this Court.<br/> <br/>According to the submissions from prosecution and observations made by the Tribunal, it indicate that the accused remained absconding from the place of occurrence for certain period, which is a circumstances leading to the inference of guilt. In our view it is mere submissions and observation of the Court below. The prosecution measurably failed to establish by evidence that soon after the occurrence, the accused had any responsibilities to discharge his duties towards the occurrence. It is well settled that mere abscondence cannot always be a circumstances leading to the inference of guilt of the accused. In this case, there is no evidence against the accused. Hence their subsequent abscondence cannot be treated as a circumstances leading to the inference of involvement in the crime. Mere abscondence cannot always be a circumstances which should lead to an inference of guilt of the accused. Sometimes out of fear and self respect and to avoid unnecessary harassment even an innocent person remain absconding for sometime.<br/> <br/>With this regard reliance are being placed in the cases of Monsur Ali Vs. The State 13 BLC 196. Similar views were taken in the cases of State Vs. Badsha Molla, 41 DLR 11, State Vs. Mofijuddin 4 BLD-481=10 BLC-93, State Vs. Lalu Mia, 39 DLR(AD)117, State Vs. Sree Ranjit Kumer Promanik, 45 DLR 660, Ali Vs. Crown 6 DLR(W.P.)52, Rahman Vs. The State of U.P. AIR 1972(SC)110, Shajahan Vs. The State 46 DLR-575, Mojibur Rahman Vs. The State 13 MLR-88.<br/> <br/>Moreover the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence in its entirety is not well founded in the facts and circumstances of the case. Therefore, the submissions advanced by the learned Deputy Attorney General are not the correct exposition of law,  however we have gone through the decisions as referred by him, we are in full agreement with the principles enunciated therein but the facts leading to those cases are quite distinguishable to that of the instant case. Therefore, we are unable to accept his submissions. On the contrary submissions advanced by the learned Counsels for the defence prevail and appear to have a good deals of force.<br/> <br/>In the light of discussions made above and the preponderant judicial views emerging out of the authorities refer to above we are of the view that the prosecution measurably failed to prove the charge against the condemned prisoner beyond all reasonable doubt. Thus the reference having no merit fails.<br/> <br/>In the result:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(a) Death reference no. 56 of 2006 is rejected.<br/>(b) The impugned Judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 29-06-2006 passed by learned Judge of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal No.1, Rangpur in Nari-O-Shishu Case no. 328 of 2000, is hereby set aside.
