The case of the plaintiffs, in short, is that Sheikh Jaku, the predecessor of the plaintiffs, being in need of money gave the suit land in mortgage to Zamindar Sachindra Mohan Roy and others of Royel. Money borrowed was repaid. Yet Zamindar Sachindra Mohan Roy and other did not release possession of the suit land. The matter was complained to the Debts Settlement Board. The Board directed Sachindra Mohan and others to return the land by an award. The Zamindar preferred an appeal to the High Court Division and the award was cancelled. After that, the mortgagor filed revision case before the learned District Judge, which was dismissed. But the learned District Judge made certain comments in favour of title of the mortgage of Sheikh Jaku. On the basis of those comments, the heirs of Sheikh Jaku had filed a Partition Suit No.76 of 1951 in the First of the then Subordinate Judge, Dhaka. Defendant Nos.13-16 and 18 contested the suit, which was decreed for declaration of title as well as for partition. On the basis of that decree, the plaintiffs and defendants Nos.19 and 20 had effected an amicable partition amongst themselves. A solenama was prepared incorporating the said amicable partition. The solenama was filed and a final decree was passed on the basis of that solenama. The plaintiffs are now owners and possessors of the suit land on the basis of that decree. Nazimuddin, the predecessor of the defendants, who was impleaded as defendant No.14 in that partition suit contested the suit. But Nazimuddin by suppressing the fact of the decree, at the time of S. A. operation, in collusion with surveyors got ‘Ka’ scheduled land recorded along with other lands in his name though he had no right, title or possession over the suit land and such erroneous record created clouds over the title of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs are still in possession of the suit land. The plaintiffs got their names mutated in respect of the suit land along with some other lands and have been paying taxes regularly. After that, the defendants started disturbing over the peaceful possession of the plaintiffs by adopting various techniques and they also threatened the plaintiffs to dispossess them from the suit land forcibly. Hence, the plaintiffs were constrained to file the suit against the defendants seeking declaration of title over the suit land.<br/> <br/>Defendant Nos.1-7 contested the suit by filing a joint written statement denying all the material statements made in the plaint. The case of these defendants, in short, is that the suit is not maintainable without the prayer for recovery of khas possession. Their further case is that one Bendu Bepari was the owner of the land of khatian No.379 who died leaving behind four sons, namely, Kunduly, Barkat, Jaku and Asman and C. S. khatian record was correctly recorded in their names. After that, Kunduly died leaving behind two sons, namely, Kazimuddin and Nazimuddin and Asman died leaving behind one daughter Habiba, who sold 09½ decimals of land in plot No.502 on 13.01.1951 to the defendant and delivered possession thereof. Barkat died leaving wife Sabjan and three sons, namely, Sonaruddin, Yazuddin and Megu and three daughters. Sabjan sold 12 decimals of land in plot NO.492 on 25.08.1956 to the father of the defendant. Nazimuddin owned and possessed 18 decimals of land in plot No.502 by purchase and inheritance from his father. Badsha, son of Azimuddin possessed 24 decimals of land in plot NO.487 by inheritance from his father and Sheikh Jaku mortgaged 74 decimals of land of plot No.487 and 6 decimals in plot No.497 for want of money to Zaminder Sachindra Mohan Roy but failed to repay the borrowed money, as a result, the said mortgaged land was sold in auction and the Zaminder purchased the same in auction. After that, Zaminder Sachindra gave pattan of the suit land to Nazimuddin, the predecessor of the defendants on 23<sup>rd</sup> Aswin of 1352 B.S. The S. A. khatian was recorded in the name Nazimuddin correctly. After the death of Nazimuddin, defendant Nos.1-7 inherited the suit land. Therefore, the plaintiffs are not entitled to get any relief according to law. And as such, the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/>The trial Court upon hearing the parties by its judgment and order dated 31.01.1991 decreed the suit.<br/> <br/>Against the judgment and decree passed by the trial Court, defendant Nos.1-7 preferred Title Appeal No.120 of 1991 before the learned District Judge, Dhaka. On transfer, the appeal was heard and disposed of by the learned Additional District Judge, Eighth Court, Dhaka, who by his judgment and order dated 18.03.1993 allowed the appeal setting aside the judgment and decree passed by the trial Court.  <br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and decree of the appellate Court, the plaintiffs filed a revisional application before the High Court Division and obtained Rule in Civil Revision No.1104 of 1993. The High Court Division by its judgment and order dated 20.08.2006 made the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>Feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with judgment and order dated 20.08.2006 passed by the High Court Division, the defendant-leave-petitioners moved this Division by filing Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.939 of 2007 in which leave was granted on 14,05.2008 resulting in Civil Appeal No.153 of 2008.<br/> <br/>Mr. A. Q. M. Fazlul Huq Khan, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the defendant-appellants, submits that the High Court Division erred in law in failing to consider the exhibits filed on behalf of defendants-appellants in respect of the suit land by which, the defendants-appellants claimed title over the suit land and as such, the impugned judgment should be set aside. He further submits that the suit filed by the plaintiffs-respondents is hit by the proviso to section 42 of the Specific Relief Act as the plaintiff-respondent Nos.1-8 are admittedly out of possession of the suit land as is evident from the deposition of P.Ws.2 and 3 and that the High Court Division committed in error in not taking into consideration the point and that the suit being instituted long 28 years from the date of recording S.A. khatian in the name of Nazimuddin, the predecessor-in-interest of the defendants-appellants, is hopelessly barred by limitation.<br/> <br/>Mr. Ziaur Rahman, learned Advocate, appearing on behalf of respondent Nos.1-8, on the other hand, submits that the High Court Division came to a finding that Nazimuddin, the predecessor-in-interest of defendant-respondent Nos.1-8, was defendant No.14 in Partition Suit No. 36 of 1956, which was decreed on compro-mise and that the plaintiffs obtained possession in the suit land through Court as per the saham prepared by the Advocate Commissioner and had been possessing the suit land peacefully and as such, the heirs of Nazimuddin cannot dispute the title of the plaintiffs-respondents and as such, the impugned judgment does not call for any interference. He further submits that lower appellate Court erroneously came to a finding that P.Ws.2 and 3 admitted that defendant Nos.1-8 had been in possession of the suit land and that if the evidence of P.Ws.2 and 3 is considered as a whole, it will transpire that they, in fact, supported the possession of the plaintiffs in the suit land.<br/> <br/>Before addressing the contentious submi-ssions made by the learned Advocates of both the sides, let us go through the grounds, on which, leave was granted, which are as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“The High Court Division erred in law in failing to consider exhibits-1-1(kha), Ka, Gha, Ja, Uma, Cha and Chha in respect of the title of the respondent over the suit land and also failed to consider that the suit is hit by the proviso to section 42 of the Specific Relief Act as the plaintiff-respondent Nos.1-8 were admittedly out of possession of the suit land as is evident from the deposition of P.W.2 in his examination-in-chief as well as in his cross examination and further the High Court Division also fell in error in not taking into consideration the point that the suit being instituted after long 28 years from the time of recording of S.A. khatian in the name of Nazimuddin, their predecessor is hopelessly barred by limitation.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Admittedly, the plaintiffs’ predecessor filed Partition Suit No.36 of 1956 against the predecessor of defendant-appellant Nos.1-7 and all other co-sharers in respect of the suit land and other lands and the suit was decreed in terms of a solenama. The plaintiffs-respondents contended that the suit land fell in the saham of the predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiffs-respondents according to the saham prepared by the Advocate Commissioner. It is not disputed that Nizamuddin, the predecessor-in-interest of the defendants-appellants was defendant No.14 in that partition suit. If we start from filing of Partition Suit No.36 of 1956 there is no necessity of considering the conflicting claim of title of the respective parties over the suit land. The lower appellate Court, however, found that the plaintiffs could not prove their title and possession in the suit land and that the suit is hopelessly barred by limitation.<br/> <br/>In a suit for declaration of title, the plaintiffs are not only required to prove their title in the suit land but also their possession therein. <br/> <br/>P.W.2, Md. Momtaz Uddin Sheikh in examination-in-chief stated that <strong>বিবাদীরা এক কোটা জমিতে দখলে আছেz সবটাতে যায় না</strong> <strong>এ মোকদ্দমা করার আগেই বিবাদীরা নালিশী এক কোটাতে দখলে আছে</strong>.<strong> সেই কোটা জমির পরিমাণ  .৩০/.৪০ ডিং হবেz বর্তমান বিবাদীরা নাজিম উদ্দিনের ওয়ারিশ এই নাজিম উদ্দিন অাগের সেই মোকদ্দমায় পক্ষ ছিল</strong> In cross examination this witness further stated that<strong> নালিশী জমিতে .০৬ ডিং বাড়ি কোন দিকে আছে বলতে পারব না বাড়িতে কিছু অংশে বিবাদী বসবাস করে</strong><br/> <br/>P.W.3, Md. A. Alim stated in his cross-examination that <strong>বর্তমানে এই .৭৪ ডিং নিয়া পক্ষগণ (মধ্যে) গনডুগুল আছে  আর কি পরিমান নিয়া মামলা বলতে পারবনাz এই মামলার পর এই .৭৪ ডিং এর মধ্যে বিবাদীরা দখলে যায়z আবার বাদীরা দখল নেয় এই ভজঘট  চলছে বর্তমানে এই জমি পতিতz মাসখানেক আগে এই জমিতে বিবাদীরা ধান বুনে ছিল ধান কাটিয়া অর্ধেক বিবাদীরা নিয় গিয়াছেz বাকী অর্ধেক গ্রামের তৃতীয় ব্যাও্রির কাছে আছে</strong><br/> <br/>Having considered the evidence of P.Ws.2 and 3, it appears that the plaintiffs could not prove their exclusive possession in the suit land. When the witnesses of the plaintiffs could not prove possession of the plaintiffs in the suit land, they are not entitled to have a decree in respect of the suit land.<br/> <br/>The High Court Division, however, found that the plaintiffs have been in possession of the suit land pursuant to the decree passed in Partition Suit No.36 of 1956 without at all considering of evidence of the plaintiffs’ witnesses, in particular, P.Ws. 2 and 3.     <br/> <br/>Admittedly, the S.A. khatian in respect of the suit land was prepared in the name of Nizamuddin, the predecessor-in-interest of the defendants and that the suit land has been filed after 28 years of the preparation of the alleged khatian. Mere preparation of khatian is of no avail till the plaintiffs are affected by the preparation thereof and as such, it cannot be said that the suit is barred by limitation. We have already found that the plaintiffs could not prove their exclusive possession in the suit land. Where the plaintiffs are out of possession and the defendants are in possession, the “further relief” would be recovery of possession and the suit for declaration of title without prayer for recovery of possession is hit by the proviso to section 42 of the Specific Relief Act.<br/> <br/>We notice with approval similar view taken in the cases of <em>Abdul Hamid Mollah Vs. Abdul Hye and others, (1997) 49 DLR 428, Abdur Rahman Mia (Md) Vs. Md. Saber Ali Mia (1999) 4 BLC 429; Shahani Bibi being dead her heirs: Mohammad Azim and others Vs. Nurul Islam being dead his heirs: Doly Islam and others (1999) 4 BLC 195; and Haji Yar Ali Khan Chowdhury Vs. Mobarak Ali Chowdhury and other,(1955) 7 DLR 6. </em> <br/> <br/>In the light of the findings, we find that the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court Division cannot sustain in law.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court Division is set aside without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

N. M. Bashir Ullah,  J:</u></em></strong><br/> <br/>This Rule, was issued on an application under Section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure (in short, the CPC) filed by the defendant- petitioners calling upon the opposite parties to show cause as to why the impugned judgment and decree dated 25.3.2009 passed by the learned Additional District Judge,  Thakurgaon in Other Appeal no. 74 of 2007 reversing the judgment and decree dated 6.6.2007 passed by the learned Senior Assistant Judge, Pirgonj, Thakurgaon in Other Class suit no. 19 of 2005 dismissing the suit should not be set aside and /or pass such other or further order or orders as to this Court may seem fit and proper.<br/> <br/>The facts leading to the issuance of the Rule, in short, is that the present opposite party no. 1 Md. Abul Kashem as plaintiff instituted the above numbered suit in the Court of Assistant Judge, Pirgonj, Thakurgaon for declaration of plaintiffs title in to the suit land averring inter alia that .80 acres of land appertains to plot no. 2045 of CS khatian no. 444 corresponding to SA khatian no. 157 originally belonged to Asiruddin, the father of the plaintiff and the defendant nos. 1 and 2. Asiruddin gifted the said land executing and registering heba-bil ewaj dated 10.03.1983 being deed no. 3161 of Sub-Registrar office Pirgonj to the plaintiff and possession of the said land was delivered in his favour. Asiruddin died on 21.3.2005. After the death of Asiruddin defendants were hatching plan to disposses the plaintiff from the suit land. On 8.4.2005 when the plaintiff took an  attempt to cut and takeaway the ripe  paddy of the field, the defendants threatened him with dispossession and they also claimed title over the suit land, hence the plaintiff has been  constrained to file the suit. It is to be noticed  here that at the initial  stage of the filing of the suit the plaintiff sought simple permanent injunction but later on through amendment of plaint declaration of title to the suit land was prayed for.<br/> <br/>The suit was contested by the defendant nos. 1-6. Among others it was averred in the written statement that the suit is not maintainable in its present form and the suit is barred by Limitation etc.<br/> <br/>The case of the defendants, in short, is that the plaintiff and defendant nos. 1 and 2 are the sons of Asiruddin. Asiruddin was a poor farmer. The defendant nos. 1 and 2 have been living in the separate mess while the plaintiff has been living with his father Asiruddin. Asiruddin had also 5 daughters who have been living with their respective husbands. Since the plaintiff had been living with his father he used to instigate his father to give the land to him and Asiruddin being influenced by the said instigation might have executed and registered a deed of heba-bil-ewaj  for .80 acres of land in favour of the plaintiff. At the time of heba-bil-ewaj Asiruddin was given a Jainamaj and Tasbi and the plaintiff made promise to give a Holy Quaran Sharif to his father but till today he did not give Holy Quaran Sharif to his father. At the old days of  Asiruddin, the plaintiff did not take his proper care and Asiruddin was dealt badly by the plaintiff and Asiruddin being annoyed of the misbehavior of the plaintiff cancelled the heba-bil-awaj executing and registering a deed on 27.07.1993 and Asiruddin was inducted into possession of the land through his other sons. On 20.8.2005 Asiruddin took an attempt to irrigate water through power pump in the suit land but the plaintiff resisted the same and at one stage there took place a quarrel between the plaintiff and his father and his father ultimately became sick and at hospital he died. The plaintiff has been possessing 1/3 portion of the suit land while the defendants have been possessing the rest of 2/3 portion of the suit land as the successive heirs of Asiruddin. The plaintiff has no right, title, interest and possession into the suit land through the heba-bil-ewaj in question. So the suit is liable to be dismissed with costs.   <br/> <br/>Upon the above pleadings, the trial Court framed as many as 5 issues to dispose of the suit. The plaintiff examined 3 witnesses and submitted the original heba-bil-ewaj, marked as exhibit 2, while the contesting defendants examined 3 witnesses and filed the certified copy of the deed dated 27.7.1993 marked as exhibit ‘ka’. The trial Court on consideration of the evidence and other materials on record dismissed the suit. As against the said judgment, the plaintiff preferred Other Appeal no. 74 of 2007 in the Court of District Judge, Thakurgaon and ultimately the appeal was heard by the Additional District Judge, Thakurgaon who by his impugned judgment dated 25.3.2009 decreed the suit. The defendant-petitioners being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the said judgment and decree of the appellate Court below moved this Court and obtained the present Rule. The Rule is resisted by the plaintiff-opposite party no. 1.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Abdul Khaleque, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioners supporting the Rule submits that the appellate Court below without considering the evidence and other materials on record decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiff, he failed to consider that the plaintiff had no possession into the entire land on the basis of heba-bil-ewaj and he misconstrued the evidence of PW 2 and thereby came to a wrong conclusion that the plaintiff has been possessing the suit land.<br/> <br/>He further submits that initially the plaintiff filed the suit for permanent injunction against the defendants who allegedly threatened him with dispossession but later on through amendment of the plaint the plaintiff sought declaration of title into the suit land but he did not make any amendment in the line of defendants. In a suit for  permanent injunction, the person or persons who allegedly made threat of dispossession of the plaintiff in to the suit land are the necessary parties and in that view of the matter, the plaintiff rightly impleaded the defendants who allegedly threatened him with dispossession from the suit land but in a suit  for declaration of title all the co-sharers of the suit holding are the necessary parties but the plaintiff without impleading all the co-sharers of the suit holding proceeded in the suit but the appellate Court below without considering this important facts decreed the suit.<br/> <br/>He lastly submits that if it is conceded for a moment that a registered deed can not be cancelled by another registered deed but in that event also the plaintiff can not get a decree for declaration of  title in a defective suit which was filed against some defendants who threatened the plaintiff with dispossession but the appellate Court below totally failed to consider this important question of law and thereby committed an error of law occasioning failure of justice to the defendant-petitioner. So the judgment and decree, complained of, is liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/>On the other hand Mr. Md. Alamgir Mustafizur Rahman, the learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff-opposite party no. 1 opposing the Rule submits that the crux point in this Rule as well as in the suit is to consider whether a registered deed can be avoided by another registered deed and the appellate Court below rightly considered that the heba-bil-awaj dated 10.03.83 was acted upon and  by any subsequent deed that can not be cancelled. <br/> <br/>He further submits that the plea of mis-joinder and non-joinder of parties must be taken at the earliest opportunity of the suit, so that the plaintiff can take proper step to address the said plea but in this particular suit the plaintiff did not raise any objection as to non-joinder of parties but at this stage the defendants surprisingly cannot raise the same  to embarrass the plaintiff-opposite-party. The learned Advocate in support of such contention refers the case of 28 DLR (AD) 5.  He also submits that since the pela of non-joinder of parties was not raised in the earliest stage of the suit, the same shall be treated as has been waived.<br/> <br/>He further submits that there is no case in the hands of the defendants that the heba-bil-ewaj dated 10.03.1983 has not been acted upon and the deed of cancellation dated 27.07.1993 is the best evidence and proof that the heba-bil-ewaj was rightly acted upon and pursuant to the heba-bil-ewaj the plaintiff was inducted into the possession of suit land and there appears no event that the plaintiff was ousted from the suit land and the defendants themselves have admitted the possession of the plaintiff into the suit land but they technically  for their illegal  gain admits the  possession of the plaintiff  into  1/3 portion of the suit land. Infact the plaintiff has been possessing the entire .80 acres of the land pursuant to the heba-bil-ewaj dated 10.03.1983. The appellate Court below considering the evidence and other materials on record rightly decreed the suit infavour of the plaintiff which does not call for any interference from this Court.<br/> <br/>I have considered the above arguments and submissions of the learned Advocates of both the parties with profound attention and  have gone through the materials on record.<br/> <br/>In this Rule as well as in the suit it is admitted that Asiruddin being owner and possessor of .80 acres of land gifted the same infavour of his one of the son, the  plaintiff by a registered deed of heba-bil-ewaj dated 10.03.1983. In the written statement it has been told repeatedly that the plaintiff promised to give a Holy Quaran Sharif along with Jainamaj and Tasbi but later on the plaintiff did not give the Holy Quaran Sharif to his father and it is the definite case of the defendants that since the plaintiff did not give the Holy Quaran Sharif to his father as promised and also for non compliance some of the conditions of the  deed of gift, Asiruddin, the father of the plaintiff and defendant nos. 1 and 2 cancelled  the deed of gift by another deed  dated 27.7.1993.<br/> <br/>On going to the exhibit 2, the deed of heba-bil-ewaj dated 10.03.1983 I find there was no any such promise in the deed that the plaintiff would give a Holy Quaran Sharif to his father. From the recital of the deed it is clear that father Asiruddin taking a Jainamaj and Tasbi gifted the land to his son, the plaintiff. Moreso, there appears no such condition in the deed which requires to be  obeyed by the plaintiff after the registration of the said deed. However, be that as it may, the crucial question in this Rule is whether a registered deed can be cancelled by another registered deed and the answer of this proposition is available in the Case of Jobeda Bewa and others Vs Md. Abdur Razzaque, 12 MLR(AD) 17. This type of question was raised in the reported case and the Appellate Division in their verdict hold that the law is well settled that a registered deed of gift duly acted upon by delivery of possession of the suit land can not be cancelled by a subsequent registered deed and a registered instrument can not be avoided except by a decree of competent Civil Court.  The appellate Division also held in the following manner.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“If such type of cancellation of a registered instrument is allowed  to continue, there will be no sanctity of any registered instrument.”(para 9 of the judgement)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Golam Mustafa and others Vs. Kazem Ali Khan @ Kazal Khan and other 50 DLR 544 it was held by this Court that since the deed of heba-bil-ewaj was validly made it was not liable to be cancelled by a donar by the deed of cancellation unilaterally except by filing a proper suit in this behalf.<br/> <br/>Now, the preponderant views emerged from the above cited authorities that whenever a heba-bil-ewaj is registered and acted upon the same cannot be avoided by another registered deed and the only proper way to avoid the same to have a decree from the competent civil  Court on any proper allegation or reason and  as such,  it can safely be concluded that by the deed  of cancellation dated 27.7.1993 there is no scope to hold that the heba-bil-ewaj dated 10.03.1983 has been vanished.<br/> <br/>From the materials on record there appears no event that after the cancellation of the heba-bil-ewaj Asiruddin was inducted into the possession of the land again evicting his  son, the plaintiff, rather there is a story that in the month of February 2005, Asiruddin took an attempt to get the land  in  his control and we find that in the same year the present suit was filed.<br/> <br/>In this Rule, the main arguments of the petitioners as has been advanced that since the suit was for declaration of  title of the plaintiff in to the suit land, all the co-sharers of the suit holding were the necessary parties. I find it difficult to show any disagreement with the proposition advanced by the  learned Advocate for the petitioners but if the objection as to the non-joinder of parties is waived at the earliest opportunity of the suit,  the defendants can not get any advantage of the same at this stage.<br/> <br/>On a meticulous perusal of the written statements it appears that the pela or objection as to the non-joinder of parties was never taken by the defendants, as such, the plaintiff did not get proper chance to  address the same pela. So the plaintiff-opposite-party can not be penalised at this stage of the proceeding.<br/>In the case of Abu Saber Aziz Mohammad and others Vs. Government and others 31 DLR (AD) 218 it was held that objection as to non-joinder of parties ought to have been taken at the earliest possible opportunity and  if not taken it shall be treated as waived. The same view was also taken in the case of Matilal Sikder and others Vs. Benodini Dasi being dead her heirs Bepin Behari Das and others 28 DLR (AD) 5.<br/> <br/>From the plaint it appears that all the co-sharers of the suit holding were not made parties in the suit and the heirs of Asiruddin were made defendants in the suit but at the same time there appears no objection in the written statements as to the non-joinder of parties. So in my consideration at this stage I find it difficult to give any premium or advantage to the defendant-petitioners. The appellate Court below on due consideration of the evidence and other materials on record rightly decreed the suit infavour of the plaintiff. I find no error of law or fact in the judgment of the appellate Court below, as such; there appears no merit in the Rule.<br/> <br/>In the result, the Rule is discharged without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/>The stay order passed earlier by this Court is hereby recalled and vacated.<br/> <br/>Let a copy of the judgment and order along with lower Court’s records be sent to the concerned Court for information and necessary action.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div><div><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"> </div></div></div></div>

The plaintiff’s case in short is that the defendant No.1, Darul Islam (father of petitioner Nos.1-5) was the original owner of the suit land, who proposed to sell the suit land at Tk.2,05,000/- and accordingly a Bainanama was executed and signed on 30.6.2005 between the parties where it was mentioned that the balance amount of Tk.90,000/- would be paid within 15.3.2006 for executing and registering the kabala deed in favour of the plaintiffs. In this background  as per terms and condition of the Bainanama the plaintiffs went to the defendant No.1 in time for  registration of kabala on taking the balance amount of Tk.90,000/- but the defendant finally denied to do the same  on 28.02.2006 and hence, the suit.<br/> <br/>The petitioner as defendant entered appearance in the suit and filed written statement denying all the material allegations of the plaint and also contended that the suit is barred by the provisions of section 21A of the Specific Relief Act and section 17B of the Registration Act. Immediately, after filing of the written statement the defendant Nos.1 and 2 filed an application under Order 7, Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure for rejecting the plaint mainly on two counts that: (i) since balance amount of consideration of the contract is not deposited at the time of filing of the suit, the suit is barred by section 21A of the Specific Relief Act, (ii) the suit is barred by section 17B of the Registration Act as the bainanama was not presented for registration as per provision of section 17A of the Registration Act.<br/> <br/>The learned Senior Assistant Judge, Dinajpur upon hearing the parties by order No.28 dated 01.7.2009 rejected the application in giving a direction upon the plaintiffs to deposit the balance amount of contract.<br/> <br/>The defendant-petitioners, thereupon, preferred Civil Revision No.79 of 2009 before the learned District Judge, Dinajpur which was subsequently transferred to the Court of Additional District Judge (in-chrge), Dinajpur for disposal, who by the impugned judgment and order dated 24.3.2013 rejected the revision and affirmed the order of the trial Court.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and order dated 24.3.2013 the present petitioners have come before this Court and obtained the present Rule.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Taherul Islam, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioners submits that both the Courts below without applying its judicial mind into the facts and circumstances of the case and law bearing on the subject most illegally disallowed  the prayer for rejection of the plaint and the same has occasioned failure of justice. Finally,  he submits that admittedly at the time of filing of the suit the plaintiffs did not deposit the balance consideration money and admittedly the plaintiffs did not or could not present the unregistered deed for registration  as per  mandatory provision of section 17A of the Registration Act and  in that view of the matter the suit is squarely barred by the provision of section 21A of the Specific Performance of Contract and section 17A  of the Registration Act.<br/> <br/>Mr. Abdullah Al- Mahmud Chowdhdury, the learned Advocate appearing for the opposite party Nos.1 and 2, on the other hand, supports the impugned judgment and contends that both the courts below were perfectly justified in refusing the petitioners’ prayer for rejection of the plaint on the clear finding that in the facts and circumstances of the case the plaint is neither barred by section 21A of the Specific Performance of Contract nor barred by section 17A of the Registration Act.<br/> <br/>I have heard the learned Advocates for both the sides and perused the revision application along with other materials on record as filed thereto including the impugned judgment and order dated 24.3.2013. The main point for consideration is, as already noticed, whether the courts below were right   in holding that the plaint of the suit is neither barred by section 21A of the Specific Performance of Contract nor barred by section 17A of the Registration Act.<br/> <br/>On perusal of the record, it appears that on 13.3.2013 the opposite party Nos.1 and 2 as plaintiffs filed Other Class Suit No.58 of 2006 for specific performance of contract in the Court of Senior Assistant Judge, Sadar, Dinajpur and admittedly the plaintiffs at the time of filing of the suit did not deposit balance consideration amount of contract. The learned Senior Assistant Judge by his order No.28 dated 9.7.2009 rejected the application under Order 7, Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure in giving a direction upon the plaintiffs to deposit the balance amount of consideration of the contract on 21.10.2009.<br/> <br/>The revisional Court below in its turn by the impugned judgment and order dated 24.3.2013 affirmed the decision of the trial Court below on the finding that: “উভয় পক্ষের যুও্রিতর্কের আলোকে অন্য ৫৮/০৬ নং মামলার নথিসহ তর্কিত আদেশ ও সংশ্লিষ্ট আইন পর্যালোচনায় দেখা যায় যে, রেজিষ্ট্রেশন এ্যাক্ট  এর সংশোধীত ১৭এ ধারা ০১/৭/০৫ ইং তারিখ থেকে কার্যকর হয়z উও্র ধারার বিধানমতে উও্র ধারা কার্যকর হওয়ার পর ১ বৎসরের মধ্যে তথা অরেজিষ্ট্রিকৃত বায়নাপত্র রেজিষ্ট্রেশনের জন্য ৬ মাস সময় অতিবাহিতের এবং তারপর ৬ মাসের মধ্যে অর্থ্যাৎ ১৩/৩/০৬ ইং তারিখে মামলাটি দায়ের হওয়ায় মামলাটি আইনতঃ চলতে পারেz বিধায় বিজ্ঞ নিম্ন আদালত তর্কিত আদেশে বিস¹ারিত আলোচনা  রিভিশনকারী বিবাদীপক্ষের দাখিলী দেঃ কাঃ বিঃ ৭ আদেশ ১১ নিয়োমের দরখাস¹ নামনজুর করে আইনতঃ ভূল করেননি বলে বিবেচনা করা যায়”<br/> <br/>This being purely a finding of fact based on correct evaluation of the facts and law. The proposition of law is by now well settled that in deciding  an application under Order VII, Rule 11 CPC  the Court is not permitted to travel beyond the averments made in  the plaint. To determine the truth of the mixed question of law and fact, evidence is necessary and this can be available only in the course of trial of the suit.<br/> <br/>On a query by me the learned Advocate for the opposite parties submits that the plaintiffs have already been deposited the balance consideration of the contract as per direction of the trial Court below.<br/>To meet the argument of the learned Advocate for the petitioners, I have carefully examined the provision of section 21A of the Specific Performance of Contract to the best of my ability and find section 21A(b) provides that the balance amount of consideration of the contract  is deposited in the Court at the time of filing of the suit for Specific Performance of Contract although, the provision of section 21A of the Specific Performance of Contract does not provide for the consequence, if the suit is filed without depositing the balance amount of consideration of the contract in the Court. My view is, therefore, that provision of section 21A is merely directory and not mandatory since there is no legal mandate to stop or dismiss the suit if balance amount of consideration of the contract is not deposited in the Court at the time of filing of the suit for Specific Performance of Contract. So, I find no difficulty in holding that, if  a litigant for any reason after taking permission from the Court filed the suit and  later on he made the deposit of  the balance amount of consideration of the contract   in the Court as per order of the Court,  in such case it cannot be said that the suit is barred by section 21A of the Specific Performance of Contract. Further, it is the positive case of the plaintiffs that  as per terms and condition of the unregistered contract  the plaintiffs went to the defendant No.1 in time for  registration of kabala on taking the balance amount of Tk.90,000/- but the defendant finally denied to do the same on 28.02.2006 and in such circumstance, the question to  present the unregistered contract for registration according to the provision of section 17A of the Registration Act by the plaintiffs does not arise at all. The contentions raised by Mr. Md. Taherul Islam for the aforesaid reasons are of no substance.<br/> <br/>The learned Judge of the revisional court below appears to have considered all the material aspects of the case and justly upheld the order of the trial Court. I find no reason to interfere therewith. <br/> <br/>In the result, the Rule is discharged without any order as to costs. The order of stay granted earlier by this Court stands vacated.<br/> <br/>Let a copy of this judgment be communicated to the Court’s concerned at once.<br/>       <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Being aggrieved by the said judgment and order the respondent Government filed Civil Petition for leave to Appeal being Nos. 320 of 2012, 1939 and 1932-33 of  2011 and 837 of 2012 before the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. The Appellate Division, after hearing the Leave Petitions analogously, by an order dated  10.1.2013 set aside the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division and sent back these writ petitions on remand before this Bench to dispose of the matter afresh on merit.<br/><br/>Facts, relevant for the purpose of the disposal of the <em>rules</em>, in short, are as follows :<br/>The petitioner in writ petition No. 1385 of 2009 was appointed as Upper Division Clerk in the Office of the Post Master General, Eastern Circle (now Central Circle), Dhaka by appointment letter dated 10.11.1979  (Annexure-A) and she joined the service in time. Her service has been confirmed and made permanent by order dated 07.01.1987 (Annexure-B) with effect from 06.10.1985. In the meantime, by a circular dated 23.05.1984 (Annexure-C) the post of Upper Division Clerk has been re-designated as Upper Division Assistant.<br/><br/>In writ petition No. 8706 of 2009 the petitioner obtained B.A. degree and appointed as Typist by  office order dated 4.4.1981 in the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education and his service was confirmed by office order dated 30.7.1983. Eventually he was promoted to the post of Upper Division Assistant on 10.4.2006.<br/><br/>In writ petition No. 8707 of 2009 the petitioner after obtaining B.A. degree was appointed as Lower Division Assistant by office order dated 6.11.1974. He joined the service on 14.11.1974 in the office of District Inspector of Schools, Dhaka. On transfer he joined in the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education on 13.5.1976. Then he was promoted to the post of Upper Division Assistant on 27.6.2000 and lastly to the post of Head Assistant on 25.03.2008.<br/><br/>In writ petition No. 7272 of 2009 the petitioner was appointed as Clerk-cum-Typist by appointment letter dated 25.8.1977 (Annexure-A) in the office of Superintending Engineer, Public Health Engineering, Chittagong Circle. He was promoted to the post of Upper Division Assistant on 30.11.2002 and then to the post of Head Assistant on 15.02.2009.<br/><br/>In writ petition No. 4544 of 2010 the petitioner was appointed as Upper Division Assistant-cum-Accountant under the Directorate of Primary Education by appointment letter dated 25.5.1983 (Annexure-A) and he joined in the service on 01.06.1983. Then by order dated 13.11.1983 his service was made permanent with effect from 01.06.1983.<br/><br/>All the petitioners are serving in different positions in different department/ministries of the government. The petitioners and other Head Assistants and Upper Division Assistants of the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, Directorate of Primary Education, Bangladesh Post Office and Public Health Engineering and similar staffs working in Bangladesh Secretariat and in the High Court Division had been discharging the same functions and accordingly had been enjoying the same status and privileges. But the Government by notification dated 13.9.1995 changed the designation of Upper Division Assistant of Bangladesh Secretariat to Administrative Officer. Then the Government by another notification dated 28.4.1997 upgraded the post of Administrative Officer as Class II Gazetted post and their pay scale was enhanced to Tk. 1725/- - 3725/-. In the notification it was stated that the scope of work and responsibility of the holders of the post would remain same as was before. Lastly, by notification dated 01.06.1999 the pay scale of Class-II Gazetted Officers was further enhanced to Tk. 3400/- - 6625/- while the status and privileges of the petitioners and other Head Assistants and Upper Division Assistants of the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education, Directorate of Primary Education, Bangladesh Post Office and Public Health Engineering remained unchanged, although they have also been serving under the same government. In the present premises the petitioners served notices demanding justice upon the respondents through their engaged Advocates to upgrade their gazetted status and pay scale as have been given to the Upper Division Assistants of Bangladesh Secretariat but the respondents did not take any action in response thereto.<br/><br/>Having no other equally efficacious alternative remedy for their redress, the petitioners filed their respective writ petitions for invoking our jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution and obtained the <em>rules nisi</em> as aforesaid.<br/><br/>The respondent-government contested the <em>rules</em> by filing affidavit-in-opposition denying the claim of the petitioners stating, inter alia, that the writ petitions are not maintainable inasmuch as  the petitioners being government servants, the only forum available to them is the Administrative Tribunal constituted under Article 117 of the Constitution; persons working in different organisations of the Republic may have the same designation but their promotion, salary, scale of pay etc. may not necessarily have to be the same and those are guided by their recruitment rules and the service condition of the employees working in the Secretariat are not applicable to the petitioners and that the post of personal officer is the feeder post of Assistant Secretary which is applicable only to employees working in the Secretariat and thus the same benefits cannot be extended to the petitioners.<br/>Mr. Abdul Quayum, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioners in all the writ petitions submits that though the respondents granted higher scale of pay, other facilities and Gazetted status to the employees of equivalent ranks posted in Bangladesh Secretariat, but they are not granting the same to the petitioners which is discriminatory, arbitrary and infringement of the petitioners’ fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 27, 29 and 31 of the Constitution. He further submits that several writ petitions including writ petition No. 7478 of 2003 and writ petition No. 2256 of 2002 involving identical questions of facts and law have already been settled by making the <em>rules</em> absolute and the judgment and order passed in writ petition No. 2256 of 2002 has been affirmed by the Appellate Division in Civil Appeal No. 218 of 2004, reported in 59 DLR(AD)54 and the principle enunciated therein being also applicable to the present writ petitions, the <em>rules</em> may be made absolute with the same direction.<br/><br/>To refute the submissions made by the learned Advocate for the petitioners, Mr. Mahbubey Alam, learned Attorney General seriously raised the question of maintainability of the writ petitions.  He contended that all the petitioners are admittedly public servants. The issue raised essentially is one of  terms and conditions of  service, therefore, their writ petitions are plainly barred under Art. 117 of the Constitution. He further submits that the petitioners as government servants serving in different departments under different ministries of the Government and their recruitment rules and service conditions are also different. Settled principle is that, he stressed, there is no flat application of the equality clause to every class of servants serving under a Government. Equality rule is only applicable among the equals. This does not mean that the petitioners are remediless. They can well seek their remedy, if available, before the Administrative Tribunal.<br/><br/>Mr. Motahar Hossain, learned Deputy Attorney General at the time of hearing of the <em>rules</em> also made submissions reiterating the same contention as have been made by learned Attorney General. He, in addition,   cited series  of decisions of our apex Court, namely,  <em>Mujibur Rahman Vs. Bangladesh</em> reported in 44 DLR (AD) 111; <em>Bangladesh Vs. Shafiuddin Ahmed</em> reported in 46 DLR (AD) 19; <em>Government Vs. Azizur Rahman</em> reported in  50 DLR (AD) 27; <em>Bangladesh Vs. Mohammad Faruque </em>reported in  51 DLR (AD) 112; <em>Delwar Hossain Mia Vs. Bangladesh </em>reported in  52 DLR (AD) 120; <em>Government of Bangladesh Vs. Md. Abdul Halim Mia and ors </em>reported in  9 MLR (AD) 105; <em>Molla Md. Anwarul Huq and ors Vs. Government of Bangladesh</em> reported in 8 ADC (2011) 782;  <em>Khalilur Rahman Vs. Md. Kamrul Hasan</em> reported in 11 MLR (AD) 5 and  <em>Bngladesh and ors Vs. Mosharraf Hossain </em>reported  in  32 BLD (AD) 67.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Counsels for the contending parties, perused the writ petitions, affidavits-in-opposition and the Annexures appended thereto.<br/><br/>In these cases the petitioners have come up before this Division for invoking our jurisdiction under Art. 102 of the Constitution for enforcement of their fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 27, 29, 31 of the Constitution which, in their words, have been infringed and violated in the way that respondents did not grant higher  scale of pay, other facilities and Gazetted status to them which have already been granted to the employees of equivalent posts in the Bangladesh Secretariat and thus they have been discriminated. On the contrary, the government forcefully raised the question of maintainability of the writ petitions on the ground that the petitioners having been serving in the service of the Republic, their redress, if any, lies before the Administrative Tribunal.  Since the fitness of things requires deciding maintainability first let us examine how far the writ petitions stand maintainability- test.<br/><br/>Art. 117 of the Constitution clearly stipulates that notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained, the Administrative Tribunal will exercise jurisdiction in respect of matters relating to or arising out of the terms and conditions of persons in the service of the Republic pursuant to which the Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980 was enacted and the Administrative Tribunals were set up to adjudicate the disputes of persons in the Service of the Republic. Art. 117(2) of the Constitution states categorically that ‘where any administrative tribunal is established under this article, no Court shall entertain any proceedings or make any order in respect of any matter falling within the jurisdiction of such tribunal’<strong>. </strong><br/><br/>In the case of <em>Mujibur Rahman vs. Bangladesh</em> reported in 44 DLR (AD) 111, the constitutionality of Section 3(3) of the Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980 together with the judgment of the Administrative Tribunal was challenged. In that case redress of the persons in the service of the Republic in respect of their infringement of fundamental rights has been settled by delivering a comprehensive judgment which is the leading judgment in the field. In Para 48 of this reported case, the apex Court, in outlining the jurisdiction of the Administrative Tribunal as well as High Court Division, observed that “<em>within  its jurisdiction the Tribunal can strike down an order for violation of principles of natural justice and for infringement of fundamental rights, guaranteed by the Constitution, or of any other law, in respect of matters relating to or arising out of sub-clause (a), but such tribunals cannot, like the Indian Administrative Tribunals in exercise of a more comprehensive jurisdiction under Article 323A (see SP Sampath Kumar Vs. Union of India, AIR 1937 SC 386 (Para 16) and JB Chopra vs Union of India AIR 1987 SC 357 ( para 2), strike down any law or rule on the ground of its constitutionality. A person in the service of the Republic who intends to invoke the fundamental right for challenging the vires of a law will seek his remedy under Article 102(1), but in all other cases he will be required to seek remedy under Article 117(2)”.</em><br/><br/>The above principle settled in Mujibur Rahman’s case adopted by our apex Court in many subsequent judgments and the said <em>ratio</em> is still governing the field.<br/><br/> In the case of <em>Bangladesh vs. Shafiuddin Ahmed</em> reported in 50 DLR (AD) 27, the <em>vires</em> of some Rules, Regulations and various Notifications were challenged as unconstitu-tional. Concurring with the principles settled in Majibur Rahman’s case Appellate Division held the writ petition to be maintainable. In para 80 of this judgment  the Appellate Division held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“In making his submission that while</em><em> deciding the case of Mujibur Rahman vs. Bangladesh, 44 DLR AD 111, this Division did not take into consideration Article 44 of the Constitution. Mr. Amirul Islam did not notice that Article 44(1) of the Constitution was in all fairness brought to the notice of this Court by the government-respondents themselves in that case (vide paragraph 47 of the Report) and the jurisdiction of an Administrative Tribunal to strike down an order for infringement of fundamental rights or any other law (but not the jurisdiction to strike down any law or rule on the ground of its constitutionality) was conceded (vide paragraph 48 of the Report). The right to move the High Court Division under Article 102(1) for enforcement of the fundamental rights is a fundamental right itself and is guaranteed by Article 44(1) and that has been recognized by the separate concurring judgment in paragraph 77 of the Report. But the right of judicial review under Article 102(2) is neither a fundamental right nor a guaranteed one. This power was never conferred upon the Tribunals under Article 117 of the Constitution (Paragraph 77of the Report).”</em><br/><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Appellate Division in paragraph 81 of Shafiuddin Ahmed’s case held that ‘<em>the supplemental, as opposed to substitutional, role of the Tribunals constituted under Article 117 of the Constitution was already conceded and permitted to the Tribunals in Mujibur Rahman case and no power of judicial review under Article 102(2) was conceded to the Tribunals in that case. The writ petitioners’ relief could not have been obtained by a supplemental role performed by the Tribunals. They have rightly invoked the jurisdiction of the High Court Division under Article 102(1) of the Constitution. The writ petitions were fully maintainable</em>’.    <br/><br/>Question of maintainability of the writ petition was again raised in the case of <em>Delwar Hossain Vs. Bangladesh</em> reported in 52 DLR (AD) 120. The writ petitioners of the case, who were appointed in the BCS (Police) cadre, challenged Notification dated 03.02.1998 by which government regularized the respondents No. 4-63 of the writ petition in the post of ASP with retrospective effect from 20.03.1991. They alleged that the impugned order was contrary to the provisions of the BCS (Police) Composition and Cadre Rules 1980, the BCS Seniority Rules, 1981 and the principle laid down in <em>Md. Abdul Mannan and others vs. Hasan Mahmud Khandaker</em>, reported in 16 BLD (AD) 147 = 1 BLC (AD) 44. They also alleged that the impugned order was violative of the fundamental right guaranteed to the writ petitioners under Articles 27, 29 and 31 of the Constitution. High Court Division discharged the <em>rule</em> holding that the writ petition was not maintainable as barred under Article 117(2) of the Constitution. Concurring with the <em>ratio decidendi </em>of Mujibur Rahman’s case the Appellate Division affirmed the judgment of High Court Division and held as follows: </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“Inviting our attention to Article 44 (1) of the Constitution that guarantees the right to move the High Court Division in accordance with clause (1) of Article 102 for the enforcement of the fundamental rights Mr. Abdur Rab Chaudhury, learned Counsel for the petitioner, submits that the High Court Division was wrong in its view that the writ petition was not maintainable. </em><br/><em>The question is no longer res integra. It has been answered by this Court in Mujibur Rahman vs Bangladesh, 44 DLR (AD) 111 in the following terms: ‘within its jurisdiction the Tribunal can strike down an order for violation of principles of natural justice as well as for infringement of fundamental rights, guaranteed by the Constitution, or of any other law, in respect of matters relating to or arising of sub-clause (a), but such tribunals cannot, like the Indian Administrative Tribunals in exercise of a more comprehensive jurisdiction under Article 323A (see SP Sampath Kumar vs Union of India, AIR 1987 (SC) 385 (Para 16) and JB Chopra vs Union of India, AIR 1987 (SC) 357 (para 2), strike down any law or rule on the ground of its constitutionality. A person in the service of the Republic who intends to invoke fundamental right for challenging the vires of a law will seek his remedy under Article 102 (1), but in all other cases he will be required to seek remedy under Article 117 (2)’. We find no reason to revise our earlier view. The gravamen of the writ petitioners’ grievance is that by the impugned order of promotion their seniority has been affected. Seniority and promotion of civil servants being terms and conditions of service the Administrative Tribunal is possessed of the exclusive jurisdiction to hear the dispute in such matters. The case is thus fully covered by our decision in the cited case. No substantial question of law has been made out for grant of leave.”</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the case of <em>Government of Bangladesh &amp; ors vs. Md. Abdul Halim Miah &amp; ors</em> reported in 9 MLR (AD) 105 the writ petitioners, civil servants, without challenging <em>vires</em> of law, had challenged certain decisions taken at the meeting of the Standing Committee and the placement in the gradation list and publication in the official gazette have been challenged by way of an application under Article 102(2) of the Constitution. The impugned decisions alleged to have infringed the petitioners’ fundamental right guaranteed under Articles 27 and 29 of the Constitution. High Court Division made the <em>rules</em> absolute, being found maintainable. Appellate Division expressing the same view arrived at Mujibur Rahman’s case allowed the appeal by setting aside the judgment of the High Court Division. In paragraph 34 of that judgment our apex Court held :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The right of judicial review under Article 102(2) of the Constitution is neither a fundamental right nor a guaranteed right. Similarly, the judicial review of an administrative action is neither an all weather remedy nor a remedy for all wrongs but is only available only when there is no other equally efficacious remedy. The writ petitioners have challenged the impugned decisions alleged to have been infringed their fundamental right guaranteed under Articles 27 and 29 of the Constitution, but in view of the provisions of Article 117(2) of the Constitution the Parliament has set up the Administrative Tribunal by enacting  Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980 for exercise of the functions enumerated in Article 117(1) i.e by setting up of the Administrative Tribunal to exercise the jurisdiction in respect of matters relating to or arising out of the terms and conditions of persons in the service of the republic etc. Article 117(2) provides that no Court shall entertain any proceeding or make any order in respect of any matter falling within the jurisdiction of such Tribunal. Section 4 of the Administrative Tribunal Act 1980 specifically provides how the jurisdiction under Article 117 (1) is conferred upon any other Court. In  the case of 44 DLR (AD) 111 it has further been cautioned that an aggrieved person may, out of desperation or just for taking a sportive chance in the summary writ jurisdiction, alleged contravention of some fundamental right which may ultimately turn out to be frivolous or vexatious or not even wrongly attracted in the case and asked to be a ground so that great value of the right given under Article 102 (1) is not frittered away or misused on the pretext of alternative remedy……”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of <em>Khalilur Rahman vs. Md. Kamrul Hasan </em>reported in  18 BLT (AD) 486 = 11 MLR (AD) 5 relying on the <em>ratio decidendi</em> of Mujibur Rahman’s  case, Appellate Division also held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“As has already been mentioned that in the case of Mujibur Rahman it has clearly been stated in the background of what circumstance in spite of the bar of Article 117(2) of the Constitution a writ petition can be filed under Article 102 of the Constitution and can be entertained by the High Court Division even the contention raised and adjudicated sought relates to term and condition of the service of a person in the service of the Republic. Therein it has been held that except on the limited ground i.e when the vires of the law is challenged or a relief by way of striking down of a particular law on the grounds of its Constitutionality sought, writ petition by the High Court Division can be entertained or in other words a person in the service of the Republic can file a writ petition on limited grounds as regard the matters, even though the same relates to the condition of service. So law is now settled that except on the limited scope a writ petition involving question of determination of the question of the matters relating to term and condition of service of a person in the service of the Republic is not entertainable  by the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution’.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"> </div><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;">In the case of <em>Molla Md. Anwarul Huq and others vs. Government of Bangladesh</em> reported in VIII ADC (2011) 782, the High Court Division held the writ petition to be maintainable as it found that the Guidelines under challenge, having been published in Official Gazette, had the force of law and Appellate Division upheld the judgment of the High Court Division.<br/><br/>In a recent case of <em>Government of Bangladesh and others vs. Md. Mosharraf Hossain</em>. Reported in 32 BLD (AD) 67 the writ petitioner, who was a Bench Reader of the Appellate Division, had challenged the <em>vires</em> of the Ôevsjv‡`k mycÖxg †KvU© (Avcxj wefvM) Gi Kg©KZ©v I Kg©Pvix‡`i wb‡qvM wewagvjv, 2000Ô as being unconstitutional as discriminatory and sought for a direction upon the government to grant him the status of First Class Gazetted Officer with a pay scale of Tk. 9000-405X16-15480 under the National Pay Scale, 2005. The Appellate Division after accepting the principles laid down in Mujibur Rahman’s case, Shafiuddin’s case and Shamsul Haque’s case found the writ petition maintainable as the <em>vires</em> of  constitutionality of Ôwewagvjv 2000Õ was challenged.<br/><br/>In the case of <em>Bangladesh Vs. Azizur Rahman reported in </em> 46 DLR (AD) 19 the writ petition, which was filed by Assistant Engineers of Bangladesh Engineering Services in different cadres, held maintainable by the apex Court as the <em>vires</em> of constitutionality of ‘The Bangladesh Ad-hoc Appointees (Counting and Determination of Seniority) Rules 1990’ was challenged together with the petitioners’ grievance as to their seniority. In the said case, as the <em>vires</em> of law was challenged, the apex Court in answering the question of maintainability held that ‘<em>it is found from the facts of the writ petitions that the question of fundamental right invoked therein has been so mixed up with the facts and statutory rules that the question of fundamental right cannot be extricated for exclusive consideration in a petition for enforcement of fundamental right. Therefore, the High Court Division rightly held the writ petitions to be maintainable under Article 102 (2)</em>’.<br/><br/><u>It appears that our apex Court consistently expressed its disapproval in invoking writ jurisdiction in respect of terms and conditions of persons in the service of the Republic unless <em>vires</em> of law on the ground of its constitutionality is challenged. The apex Court by reference to Art. 117 of the Constitution made it amply clear that where Administrative Tribunal is established under this Article no Court shall entertain any proceeding or make any order in respect of terms and conditions of persons in the service of the Republic in that the Administrative Tribunal  is conferred with jurisdiction to look into the matter. The Appellate Division has gone as far as to say that even if  within  its jurisdiction the Tribunal can strike down an order for violation of principles of natural justice and for infringement of fundamental rights, guaranteed by the Constitution, or of any other law, in respect of matters relating to or arising out of sub-clause (a) of Art. 117 (1) of the Constitution.( Emphasis added).</u><br/><br/>In the case of <em>Government of Bangladesh and others Vs. Md. Shamsul Huq</em> reported in  59 DLR (AD) 54, relied upon by the learned Advocate for the petitioners, the writ petition, which was filed by the Personal Officer of the Supreme Court, challenging <em>vires</em> of two Notifications on the ground of their constitutionality, was held to be maintainable on the ground that the impugned Notifications had the force of law saying that ‘<em>the principle as laid down in 50 DLR (AD) 27, in the facts and circumstances, are applicable in the present appeal as the writ petitioners challenged the order as contained in Annexures D(1) and D(2), which were issued under section 5 of the Services (Re-Organisation and Conditions) Act, 1975 and have the effect of law. Accordingly, the writ petition is maintainable</em>’.<br/><br/>It appears that the instant writ petitioners did not challenge <em>vires</em> of any law on the ground of its constitutionality, as such the <em>ratio</em> of the decision reported in 59 DLR (AD) 54 is not applicable in these cases.<br/><br/>In writ petition No. 7478 of 2003 (judgment of which is relied on by the learned Advocate for the petitioners) the writ petitioner, an Upper Division Assistant of High Court Division sought for direction to grant Gazetted status as had been granted to Upper Division Assistants in the Secretariat on the ground of discrimination. In that writ petition though question of maintainability was raised but the learned Assistant Attorney General could not produce any authority of our apex Court on the point of maintainability. The High Court Division also without any reference to the decisions of our apex Court, as discussed above, held that “<em>we have heard the learned Advocate of both the sides and perused the petition. On the question of forum, it is very true that the petitioner is in the service of the Republic of Bangladesh. He is posted in the office of the High Court Division of the Supreme Court. As such, any grievance with regard to the terms and conditions of his service, the Administrative tribunal is the proper forum. But in this case, his fundamental right to be treated equally with other similarly placed employees of the Republic and his entitlement to equal protection of law under Article 27 of the Constitution is involved.</em> ***********<em>The learned Assistant Attorney General could not explain as to why the petitioner and other Upper Division Assistants posted in the Office of the High Court Division were treated differently from their counter-parts posted in the Secretariat on and from 1.7.1977 by the above Notification dated 10.8.1981.This is a glaring instance of discrimination to the prejudice of the petitioner and similarly placed other employees in the country including those in the Office of the High Court Division. This is also a violation of fundamental right of the petitioner and similarly placed others, guaranteed under Article 27 of the Constitution”</em>. This judgment seems to us as a judgment <em>per incuriam</em> and thus not binding upon us in view of the <em>ratio</em>  settled by the apex Court in Mujibur Rahman’s case and subsequent cases. <br/><br/>In these cases the writ petitioners did not challenge the <em>vires </em>of any law on the ground of its constitutionality but only canvassed before us one issue that they have been subjected to discrimination in that the respondents did not grant them higher scale of pay, other facilities and gazetted status as have been granted to their counter-parts posted in the Secretariat vide Circulars dated 13.9.1995, 28.4.1997 and 1.6.1999 and thus their fundamental rights have been infringed. The grievance of the petitioners clearly relates to their terms and conditions of service and accordingly their redress, if any, is well within the jurisdiction of the Administrative Tribunal established under Art. 117(1) of the Constitution. In view of the principles laid down in the judgment of Mujibur Rahman’s case, subsequent judgments and the judgment relied on by the learned Advocate for the petitioners reported in 59 DLR (AD) 54, as discussed above, the petitioners should have agitated their grievance before the Administrative Tribunal for their redress but they instead, have come before this Division for invoking our power of judicial review under Art. 102 of the Constitution and as such we are led to hold that the writ petitions are not maintainable. For what we have stated above we are not inclined to go into the merit of their cases. Resultantly, these <em>rules </em>are liable to be discharged as not being maintainable.<br/><br/>In the result, the <em>rules</em> are discharged, however, without any order as to costs.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

The trial Court proceeded relying on the confessional statement and noticed that in 342 statement the accused made no grievance about his torture alleged to have been made by the police for obtaining a confessional statement. While the trial court kept 342 Cr.P.C. in view it is unfortunate that one of the important items for linking up the accused with the crime, namely, the sandal was not at all put to the accused as a circumstance appearing in the case against him. In the similar case In Sarwan Singh Rattan Singh Vs. State of Pubjab reported in A.I.R 1957 (SC) 637, the Indian Supreme Court considered the implication of such omission.

The hands and feet compared for size, general configuration and skin colour and texture. Examination of visceral organs for uterine cervixes, prostate glands, external genitilia can help to fix the sex and the number of victims.

The plaintiff’s case, in short, is that he married defendant No.1, Mrs. Fatema Begum who is a simple house wife had no source of income and dependent on the plaintiff-husband.The plaintiff being an industrialist and with motive to get income tax relief purchased the suit property being urban property in the “benami” of defendant No.1 and that the plaintiff purchased the suit property with his own money and he has been residing in the suit property with his family treating the same as his own property. Defendant No.1 knew that the plaintiff purchased the suit property in the “benami” of defendant No.1 who was claiming ownership of the suit property at the behest of her father and brother. Hence, the suit has been filed by the plaintiff for declaration of title in the suit property.<br/> <br/>Defendant No.1 contested the suit by filing an application under Order VII Rule 11(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure for rejection of the plaint, contending, inter alia, that under the provision of section 5 of the Land Reforms Ordinance,1984 (hereinafter referred as “the Ordinance”), the suit of the plaintiff is barred as benami transaction is prohibited.<br/> <br/>The plaintiff filed written objection against defendant’s application for rejection of the plaint. His case is that the suit property is urban property and that the Land Reforms Ordinance,1984 has been promulgated with the object to reform the land relating to land tenures, land holding and transfer with a view to maximizing production and ensuring a better relationship between land owners and bargaders and the provisions of the entire Ordinance are relating to agricultural and cultivable land holding and transfers and not relating to urban land, and the provisions of section 5 of the said Ordinance do not apply to non-agricultural urban land transfer, and the application of defendant No.1 for rejection of the plaint is liable to be rejected.<br/> <br/>The trial Court by the judgments and orders dated 17.09.2003 and 05.08.2003 rejected the plaints of both the suits.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgments and orders dated 17.09.2003 and 05.08.2003 passed by the trial Court, the plaintiff preferred First Appeal Nos.322 and 343 of 2003 before the High Court Division. The learned Judges of the High Court Division, upon hearing the parties in both the appeals, by its judgment and order dated 26.04.2010 dismissed both the appeals.<br/> <br/>Feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division, the plaintiff has filed these civil petitions for leave to appeal before this Division.<br/> <br/>Mr. Mahmudul Islam, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the leave-petitioner in both the petitions, submits that if the Land Reforms  rdinance,1984 is considered as a whole, it will appear that prohibition of benami transaction of “immoveable property” applies only in respect of agricultural land and that the High Court Division having considered the provision of section 5 of the Ordinance in particular, came to the finding that section 5 of the Ordinance applies to both agricultural and non-agricultural land. He further submits that section 5 of the Ordinance undoubtedly relates to agricultural land and the purpose of the Ordinance is to maximize production and to that end, provision has been made for stable and satisfactory relationship between agricultural land owners and bargaders and the expression “immoveable property” cannot be said to be unambiguous and there is a doubt as to whether in dealing with agricultural land, the legislative authority at all intended to bring non-agricultural land within the mischief of section 5 of the Ordinance and as such, the impugned judgment should be set aside.<br/> <br/>Mr. Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of respondent No.1 in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.2080 of 2010 and Mr. Mahbubey Alam, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of respondent No.1 in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.2081 of 2010, on the other hand, support the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Senior Advocate, perused the impugned judgment and the materials on record.<br/> <br/>Benami transactions which have been in vogue in the Indian Sub-Continent for centuries denote a transaction which is done by a person without using his own name, but in the name of another. Acquiring and holding property and even carrying on business in names other than those of real owners or in fictitious names did not contravene any provision of law and therefore, Courts had given effect to such transactions. In benami transaction, the Benamdar has no beneficial interest in the property or business that stands in his name. He only represents the real owner as his trustee. In benami transactions, the presumption is that a person who pays money is the real owner and not the person in whose name the property is purchased. Earlier men purchased properties in benami to cajole or shield themselves against the creditors. There was also the need for defrauding by making secret transactions. Fear of confiscation also led to benami holdings. Besides, these arrangements were aimed at evading the law.<br/><br/>This old age practice was given a go-by by section 5 of the Land Reforms Ordinance, 1984. Before addressing the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner, it is necessary to go through the provision of section 5 as incorporated in Chapter-3 of the Ordinance under the caption “Prohibition of Benami Transaction of Immoveable Property” as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“5.(1) No person shall purchase any immovable property for his own benefit in the name of another person.<br/>(2) Where the owner of any immovable property transfers or bequeaths it by a registered deed, it shall be presumed that he has disposed of his beneficial interest therein as specified in the deed and the transferee or legatee shall be deemed to hold the property for his own benefit, and no evidence, oral or documentary, to show that the owner did not intend to dispose of his beneficial interest therein or that the transferee or legatee hold the property for the benefit of the owner, shall be admissible in any proceeding before any Court or authority.<br/>(3) Where any immoveable property is transferred to a person by a registered deed, it shall be presumed that such person has acquired the property for his own benefit, and where consideration for such transfer is paid or provided by another person it shall be presumed that such other person intended to pay or provide such consideration for the benefit of the transferee, and no evidence, oral or documentary, to show that the transferee hold the property for the benefit of any other person or for the benefit of the person paying or providing the consideration shall be admissible in any proceeding before any Court or authority.”<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">The expression “immoveable property” is to be construed in its proper context to ascertain whether the expression is clear and unambiguous. In order to construe “immoveable property” as mentioned in section 5 of the Ordinance, all the sections of the Ordinance are to be considered. The expression immoveable property cannot be considered in isolation in the context of section 5 of the Ordinance. For proper construction, the preamble and the short title of the Ordinance are also to be considered.<br/> <br/>The preamble of the Ordinance runs as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Whereas it is expedient to reform the law relating to land tenure, land holding and land transfer with a view to maximising production and ensuring a better relationship between land owners and bargadars.” If the preamble is considered in isolation, then the submission made by Mr. Mahmudul Islam carries much force.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Now let us see what role is played by the preamble in construing a statue.<br/> <br/>According to <strong><em>Maxwell </em></strong>“when possible, a construction  should be adopted which will facilitate the smooth working of the scheme of the legislation”-<strong><em>Interpretation of Statutes</em></strong> 12<sup>th</sup> edition at page 201.<br/> <br/>In the case of <strong><em>Attorney General vs. H.R. H. Prince Earnest Gugustus of Hanover (1957) All E.R. Pg.49, Law Lord Viscount Simonds </em></strong>observed that as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“For words, and particularly general words, cannot be read in isolation; their colour and content are derived from their context. So it is that I conceive it to be my right and duty to examine every word of a statute in its context, and I use context in its widest sense which I have already indicated as including not only other enacting provisions of the same statute, but its preamble, the existing state of the law, other statutes in pari materia, and the mischief which I can, by those and other legitimate means, discern that the statute was intended to remedy.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>On the one hand, the proposition can be accepted that “.......it is a settled rule that the preamble cannot be made use of to control the enactments themselves where they are expressed in clear and unambiguous terms.”</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“I quote the words of <strong><em>CHITTY, L.J., </em></strong>which were cordially approved by <strong><em>Lord Davey in Powell V. Kempton Park Racecourse Co., Ltd(1)(</em></strong>[<strong><em>1899</em></strong>] <strong><em>A.C 143 at p.185). </em></strong>On the other hand, it must often be difficult to say that any terms are clear and unambiguous until they have been studied in their context. That is not to say that the warning is to be disregarded against creating or imagining an ambiguity in order to bring in the aid of the preamble. It means only that the elementary rule must be observed that no one should profess to understand any part of a statue or of any other document before he has read the whole of it. Until he has done so, he is not entitled to say that it, or any part of it, is clear and unambiguous.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of <strong><em>Amin Jute Mills Vs. Bangladesh 29 DLR(SC)85, </em></strong>it has been observed paragraphs 9 and 11 as  under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“It is now well-recognized, in this regard that although there was previously some difference of opinion among the distinguished jurists in England, the long title of an Act which is set out at its head giving the general purpose of the Act as well as the preamble of an Act which also recites the main object of the Act are part of the Act.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>One of the basic rules of interpretation of a statute is that to understand the meaning of a particular provision of an Act one is to read the Act as a whole each part shedding light on the other and the following observation of Lord Wright in the case of <strong><em>Jennings Vs. Kelly decided by the House of Lords and reported in 1940 A.C. 206 same case (1939) All. E.R. 464 </em></strong>may be referred in this connection.”</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The proper course is to apply the broad general rule of construction, which is that section or enactment must be construed as a whole, each portion throwing light, if need be, on the rest.”<br/>“.....If the words of a substantive provision of an Act are precise and unambiguous then the meaning thereof should not be restricted and controlled by taking recourse to the title or preamble of the Act. Lord Halsbury, L.C. in his speech in the case of Powell Vs. The Kempton Park Race Course Company Limited (1899) A.C. 143 at page 157 clearly stated the law in this regard in the following words;<br/>“Two propositions are quite clear-one that a preamble may afford useful light as to what a statute intends to reach, and another that, if an enactment is itself clear and unambiguous, no preamble can qualify or cut down the enactment.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Lord Davey dwelt on this question further in his separate speech in the same case and made the following observation at page 185 of the Report:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“undoubtedly’....I quote from Chitty L.J.’s Judgment  words with which I cordially agree...it is a settled Rule that the preamble cannot be made use of to control the enactm-ents themselves where they are expressed in clear and unambiguous terms......There is however another Rule or warning which cannot be too often repeated, that you must not create or imagine an ambiguity in order to bring in the aid of the preamble or recital. To do so would in many cases frustrate the enactment and defeat the general intention of the Legislature.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of <strong><em>Anwar Hossain Chowdhury</em></strong><strong><em> Vs. the  Government of Bangladesh, 41 DLR (AD)165, </em></strong>this Division in paragraph 489 of the report quoted with approval the observation of the Indian Supreme Court in the case of <strong><em>Sreemoti Indira Gandhi Vs. Rajnarain reported in AIR 1975 (SC)2299</em></strong> as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The preamble, though a part of the Constitution is neither a source of power nor a limitation upon that of the ideological aspirations of the peoples…………”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From the cases cited above, it appears that the preamble cannot control the meaning and expression when the meaning of the expression is clear and ambiguous. The aid of the preamble can be taken if the meanings of the words to be interpreted are not clear and ambiguous.<br/> <br/>Having gone through the preamble, we find that the preliminary object of the legislative authority is to bring about reformation of the lands in rural area. The preamble must be read with sub-section (1) of section 1 which provides that this Ordinance may be called the Land Reforms Ordinance, 1984. The legislative authority was conscious in not using the word “agriculture” before Land Reform Ordinance. What is important to note here is that the word “land” has not been defined in section 2 of the Ordinance.<br/> <br/>But in clause-(c) of section 2 ‘barga land’ has been defined. Had the legislative authority the intention to deal with agricultural land only, it would not have defined “barga land”.<br/> <br/>Sub-section (1) of section 5 of the Ordinance provides that no person shall purchase any immoveable property for his own benefit in the name of another person. Sub-section (2) of section 5 of the Ordinance provides that where the owner of any immoveable property transfers or bequeaths it by a registered deed, the presumption would be that he has disposed of his beneficial interest therein and the transferee or legatee shall be deemed to  hold the property for his own benefit and that no evidence either oral or documentary to show that the seller did not intend to dispose of his beneficial interest therein or the transferee or legatee holds the property for the benefit of the owner and that such evidence shall not be admissible in any proceeding before any Court or authority. Sub-section (3) of section 5 provides that where any immovable property is transferred to a person by a registered deed, it shall be presumed that such person has acquired the property for his own benefit and no oral and documentary evidence to show that the transferee holds the property for the benefit of another person paying or providing the consideration shall be admissible in any proceeding before any Court or authority.<br/> <br/>The language of section 5 of the Ordinance is plain and unambiguous and it is remarkable by itself. This section must be read in conjunction with sub-section (1) of section 1 of the Ordinance, which provides that this Ordinance may be called the “Land Reforms Ordinance.” While describing the (naming) Ordinance, the legislative authority was conscious in not using the word “agriculture” before the word, ‘land’.<br/> <br/>This Ordinance has been divided into six chapters. Chapter-1 containing sections 1 to 3 relates to preliminary; chapter-II containing section 4 relates to limitation on acquisition of agricultural land; chapter-III comprising section 5 relates to prohibition of benami transaction of immoveable property; chapter-IV comprising sections 6 and 7 relates to homesteads in ‘rural area’, chapter-V consisting of sections 8-18 relates to agricultural land and resolution of dispute between the land owners and bargadars and chapter-VI containing sections 20, 21 and 22 relates to miscellaneous.<br/> <br/>Having gone through all the sections of the Ordinance, in general, and section 5, in particular, we are of the view that there is no scope for reading the words ‘rural area’ in section 5 of the Ordinance. From the cases cited before, it appears that the preamble cannot be used to control the enactments themselves where they are expressed in clear and unambiguous terms. The aid of preamble can only be taken when the meanings of the words to be interpreted are not clear and unambiguous. Therefore, the words ‘immoveable property’ occurring in section 5 of the Ordinance include both agricultural and non-agricultural properties. There is no scope for encroaching upon the domain of legislature by importing the words ‘rural area’ in section 5 and addition of such words will amount to legislation by the judiciary which is not at all permissible.<br/> <br/>The Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of <strong><em>Md.  Ismail Vs. the State, 21 DLR (SC) 161 observed in paragraph 15 </em></strong>that the function of the Court is interpretation, not legislation in the following terms:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“15. The purpose of the construction or interpretation of a statutory provision is no doubt to ascertain the true intention of the Legislature, yet that intention has, of necessity, to be gathered from the words used by the Legislature itself. If those words are so clear and unmistakable that they cannot be given any meaning other than that which they carry in their ordinary grammatical sense, then the Courts are not concerned with the consequ-ences of the interpretation however drastic inconvenient the result, for, the function of the Courts is interpretation, not legislation.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The Indian Supreme Court in the case of <strong><em>Commissioner  of Income Tax, Kerala Vs. Tara Agencies </em></strong>reported in  (2007)6 Supreme Court Cases 429 held in paragraph 58 of  the report (P.447) as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“58. <strong><em>In Union of India Vs. Deoki Nandan Aggarwal, </em></strong>a three Judge Bench of this Court held that it is not the duty of the Court either to enlarge the scope of legislation or the intention of the legislature, when the language of the provision is plain. The Court cannot rewrite the legislation for the reason that it had no power to legislate. The power to legislate has not been conferred on the courts. The Court cannot add words to a statute or read words into it which are not there.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From the cases cited above, it appears that the function of the Courts is interpretation, not legislation and that Courts cannot add words to a statute or read words into it which are not there.<br/> <br/>Before promulgation of this Ordinance, the benami transactions were prevalent both in rural, urban or municipal areas. It was the intention of the legislative authority that the system, if prohibited, would be prohibited both in rural and urban or municipal areas. Though most of the provisions of the Ordinance relate to rural areas, that will not alter the meaning of the provisions of section 5 which cannot be restricted to rural areas only.<br/> <br/>Because of benami transactions, multifa-rious litigations crop up across the country. Moreover, the persons having the possession of black money take advantage of benami transa-ctions by purchasing property in the names of their nearest relatives and such transactions increase corruption in the society. So, the legislative authority had the intention to say good-bye to benami transactions once and for all.<br/> <br/>Benami transactions have been prohibited in India by the Benami Transactions (Prohibition and the Right of Recovery Property) Ordinance, 1988 followed by the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 and therefore, in India benami transactions are not permissible both in rural and urban  areas.<br/> <br/>We, however, got rid of benami transactions by the Land Reforms Ordinance, 1984.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">The findings arrived at and the decision made by the High Court Division are based on proper appreciation of law and fact.<br/> <br/>In the light of the findings made before, we do not find any substance in these civil petitions for leave to appeal.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, both the petitions are dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Convict A. Awal shall be described as convict appellant.<br/> <br/>The prosecution case, in brief, is that one Md. Abdul Hye (P.W.1) as informant lodged a First Information Report, shortly, “FIR” on August 31, 2002 with Shakhipur Police Station against the appellant alleging, <em>inter-alia</em>, that the informant’s daughter Hamida Akter was married to accused Awal about 7 years ago and the victim gave birth to a son. The informant gave everything which the accused would want for the happiness of the victim. Hamida worked as computer operator of the Registry office and the accused was a school teacher. On August 30, 2002 at around 11.30 p.m. the accused demanded Tk. 2 lacs as dowry from victim Hamida which she refused accused Awal hit her on the head with a hammer. The blow of the hammer fractured the skull of the victim and her brain spilt out. On hearing hue and cry the neighbors rushed to the spot. The neighbors considering critical condition of the victim, she was taken to shakhipur Hospital. The neighbors restrained the accused to flee.

The informant went to Shakhipur Police Station with the dead body of the victim Hamida and lodged the FIR.<br/> <br/>On the basis of the aforesaid FIR Shakhipur Police Station case No. 21 dated August 31, 2002 was started under section 11(ka) of the Ain, 2000.<br/> <br/>The Investigating Officer took the case for investigation; he visited the place of occurrence and prepared the Inquest Report of the dead body in presence of witnesses. He duly sent the dead body of the victim to the General Hospital, Tangail for post mortem. Post mortem of the victim was performed by Dr. Md. Abdul Hamid.<br/> <br/>Ultimately, on conclusion of investigation the Investigating Officer submitted charge-sheet against the accused appellant under section 11(ka) of the Ain, 2000.<br/> <br/>Later, the case was duly sent to the Tribunal for trial. Learned Judge of the Tribunal on taking cognizance of the offence against the accused under section 11(ka) of the Ain, 2000 framed charge against him under the said provision of law. On being read over and explained the charge to the accused he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/> <br/>During the course of trial the prosecution produced as many as 17 witnesses including the Medical Officer and the Investigating Officer. However, the defense but did not adduce any defense witness. The Tribunal after considering the evidence and materials on record found the accused guilty under section 11(Ka) of the Ain, 2000 and sentenced him to death by its judgment and order dated October 14, 2008.<br/> <br/>Death sentence matter has been referred to this Court by way of a Reference by Tribunal and the Reference has been noted as Death Reference No. 105 of 2008. Convict A. Awal presented a petition of Appeal from Jail which has been numbered as Jail Appeal No. 1024 of 2008. He also carried a petition of Appeal being registered as Criminal Appeal No. 7514 of 2008.<br/> <br/>Death Reference, Jail Appeal and Criminal Appeal are heard together and disposed of by this single judgment.<br/> <br/>Mr. Bishmadev Chakrabortty, learned Deputy Attorney General with Mr. Md. Atiqul Hoque, the learned Assistant Attorney General appeared in support of the Reference. While Mr. Fazlul Huq Khan Farid, learned Advocate appeared on behalf of the condemned-prisoner. Ms. Hasna Begum, learned Advocate appeared in support of Jail Appeal.<br/> <br/>Mr. Bishmadev Chakrabortty, the learned DAG, submits that the prosecution had successfully established his case beyond reasonable doubt and that the ingredients of the aforesaid special provision of law having been attracted the Tribunal duly found that the condemned prisoner had committed the offence as alleged. He also submits that reason to disbelieve the witnesses nor the defence could shake the credibility of the witnesses. The story of the case is clearly suggests the involvement of the convict A. Awal with the offence, that is, the accused has tainted his relationship with the victim over demand of dowry which the father of the victim was unable to pay. In this regard learned DAG contended that the victim was an innocent village house wife who did not have any enmity with anyone and the defence has also failed to produce any evidence on that count, the alleged occurrence also took place after about seven years of the marriage as meted out by the accused. Learned DAG insisted that a close reading of the statement of the P.Ws. and the confessional statement of the accused A. Awal proved that he is solely responsible for the murder of victim Hamida. He finally submits that the Tribunal committed no error of law or facts in passing the judgment of conviction and sentence against the convict and, therefore, there is no justifiable reason to interfere with the impugned judgment and order passed by the Tribunal.<br/> <br/>Mr. Fazlul Huq Khan Farid, learned Advocate took us through the FIR, and the entire evidence on records, including the materials exhibits and submitted that the Tribunal fell into error of law in finding the accused guilty of the charge levelled against him, for the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. He further submits that the allegation of killing the victim Hamida is not believable and the accused has been implicated by the informant out of suspicion. Considering the same the Tribunal came to its findings merely upon conjectures and surmises, not upon legal evidence on records. The taintive relationship sought to be proved as a motive of the offence has not been proved by cogent and credible evidence. He further submits with emphasis that the sentence of death passed upon the accused is extremely harsh and too severe. Death sentence, he added, should not be passed as of routine and that this is not a case in which sentence of death is warranted.  <br/> <br/>Now, in order to appreciate the arguments advanced by the learned Advocates we would now discuss the evidence adduced by the prosecution in this case.<br/> <br/>P.W 1 Md. Abdul Hye the father of the victim was examined as informant. His daughter Hamida was married to accused Awal about 7 years ago. After marriage they passed their peaceful conjugal life and the victim gave birth to a son. The informant gifted the accused everything he asked for the happiness of the victim. But the accused often demanded dowry from the victim Hamida and began torturing her. Hamida worked as computer operator of the Registry office and the accused was a school teacher. On August 30, 2002 at around 11.30 p.m. the accused demanded Tk. 2 lacs as dowry from the victim Hamida which she being refused accused Awal hit her on the head with a hammer. The blow fractured the victim's  skull and her brain spilt out. On hearing hue and cry the neighbors rushed to the spot. Considering the critical condition of the victim, the neighbors took her to Shakhipur Hospital. The neighbors restrained the accused from fleeing. The informant went to the hospital took the victim to Dhaka for better treatment. The doctors declared her dead. The informant went to Shakhipur Police Station with the dead body of the victim Hamida.<br/> <br/>The accused was handed over to the police and made a confessional statement under section 164 of the code where he admitted that he had murdered the victim. The Sub-Inspector of Police prepared a seizure list of blood stained hammer, one blood stained pillow with its cover and blood stained small pillow and another blood stained cover. He lodged the FIR. He identified the FIR and his signature thereon as exhibits 1 and 1 ka respectively. In his cross-examination he denied that it was not a fact that the accused never demand dowry from him or from his daughter or no such occurrence happened or that it was only an accident or that the accused was arrested by the police and compelled to make confessional statement after being tortured.<br/> <br/>P.W. 2 Md. Abu Bakar Siddik stated that both the parties are known to him. The occurrence took place on August 30, 2002 at around 11.30 p.m. She is the daughter of the informant. Hamida married accused about seven years ago. The accused tortured Hamida often for money and once the victim Hamida went to her father's house after being assaulted. On the date of occurrence the accused demanded Tk. 2,00,000/- as dowry and Hamida refused to give the money. The accused hit her with a hammer. Hamida became unconscious and on the way to Dhaka, she died. During investigation he was examined by the police. <br/> <br/>P.W. 3 Anwar Hossain stated that he is a farmer and both the parties are known to him. He is an uncle (j¡j¡) of the victim Hamida.  She was killed on August 30, 2002 at around 11.30 p.m. He identified the accused Awal. On the date of occurrence on August 30, 2002 at around 11.00/11.30 p.m. he was returning  along with Anisur Rahman and Rabeya from a relative's house when they reached the house of accused Awal, they heard hue and cry from the house. They went to the spot and saw the head of the victim had been smashed open. They also saw the accused standing with a hammer in his hand. On asking they came to know that the accused had demanded Tk. 2 lacs from the victim and when she refused the accused hit her on the head with a hammer. The Doctor advised that the victim be sent to Dhaka for treatment. The informant took the victim to Dhaka. He further deposed that the victim was married to the accused for 7/8 years and at the time of marriage, dowry was paid by the victim's father. The accused demanded more money from victim who because of which the accused murdered  Hamida.<br/> <br/>In cross-examination he denied that it was not a fact that he did not tell the Sub-Inspector of Police that on the date of occurrence accused Awal had demanded Tk. 2,00,000/ from the victim or that the accused never demand dowry from the victim.<br/> <br/>P.W. 4 Anisur Rahman stated that he is a deed writer. The informant is his brother-in-law and the victim is his niece. The accused Awal was married to victim Hamida about 5/7 years ago. At the time of marriage, dowry was given to the accused Awal. Thereafter, Awal demanded more money. When the accused demanded more money, the victim Hamida refused to give because of which the accused Awal tortured Hamida. He further deposed that on the date of occurrence, he went to visit relatives at village Kalidas along with Anowar and Rabiya. On the way back when they reached the house of the accused Awal, he heard hue and cry. When he entered the house, he saw  that  the victim was lying in a pool of blood with her skull smashed open. He further deposed that he saw a hammer in the hand of  the accused. Later he came to know that Awal had demanded Tk. 2,00,000/- from Hamida who refused to pay and the accused hit her on the head with a hammer. Hamida was taken to Shakhipur Hospital and later to Dhaka for treatment where she died. He went to the Shakhipur Police Station and the Officer-in-charge prepared the inquest report of the dead body. He put his signature on the inquest report.<br/> <br/>In cross examination he stated  that it was not a fact that  on the date of occurrence  he along with Rabeya and Anowar went to  village of Kalidas to the house of a relative or not a fact that   on hearing hue and cry he went to the house of Hamida or  he saw her in the bed or did not tell the Sub-Inspector of police about seeing a hammer in the hand of Awal or not a fact that  he did not  tell the Sub-Inspector of Police that when Awal demanded Tk. 2 lacs Hamida refused it to pay because of which Awal hit Hamida on the head with a hammer or not a fact that he deposed  falsely to a pre-planed case against the accused or not a fact that  there was no such occurrence at that time and he did not go to the house  of Awal.<br/> <br/>P.W. 5 Firoza stated that she is a female servant and she lived in a nearly house of the victim.  She heard hue and cry and she went to the spot and saw the victim Hamida was taken by a Van to the hospital. The skull of the victim had been smashed open. Hamida was unconscious when she was carried on a van.<br/> <br/>In cross examination she stated that it was not a fact that she did not tell the Sub-Inspector of police that Awal hit Hamida with a hammer.  It was not a fact that he deposed falsely.<br/> <br/>P.W. 6 Khadiza, stated that she is the servant at the house of the victim Hamida. The occurrence took place on August 30, 2002 at around 11.00 p.m. The accused often demanded dowry and tortured Hamida.  Once the victim Hamida went back to her father’s house and there was a salish regarding this matter.

Abdul Hamid stated in his deposition that on August 31, 2002 he performed autopsy of the dead body of victim Hamida as identified by constable 988 Suruzzaman. He found  the following injuries:</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>One lacerated injury on the vault of the skull 1'' x 1'' brain matter with fracture of right and left parietal bone of the skull. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Bruise on the right shoulder (1''x1'') and upper arm (2'' x 2'') </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Bruise on posterior aspect of right elbow (1''x 1''). </em></li></ol><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><strong>মাথার বহিরাবরন-মাথার খুলি এবং মেরুদন্ডের অসিখন্ড সমূহ: </strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Scalp-Lacerated with blood clot. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Skull-Fracture of right  and left parietal bone. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Injured Blood clot present, brain matter partially out of the skull cavity.</em></li></ol><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><strong>যখমের আরও বিস¹ৃত বিবরণ: </strong></div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">Deep dissection done and described column wise.

They saw the accused standing with a hammer in his hand. They learnt that accused Awal had hit the victim on the head. She further deposed that the inquest report of the Police was prepared in her presence and the police also seized the alamat in her presence and her signatures so endorsed thereon.<br/> <br/>P.W.10 Manik Mia stated that the accused Awal is his cousin. The occurrence took place on August 30, 2002 at around 11/11.30 p.m. He further deposed that he along with his sister Elia Khatun and aunt Hosna Khatun rushed to the house of the accused and on asking the accused came to know that he had murdered his wife victim Hamida.<br/> <br/>In cross examination he stated that Hamida was taken to the hospital. He did not hear from anyone  that after arrest accused Awal had been tortured by the police.<br/><br/>P.W. 11 Mamtaz  was tendered. <br/>P.W. 12 Arzu Mia was tendered.<br/>P.W. 13 A. Karim was tendered.<br/> <br/>P.W. 14 Md. Shamsul Arefin stated that in his deposition that on August 31, 2002 he was Magistrate First Class at Tangail. On August 31, 2002 at around 2 p.m. accused Awal was brought before him for recording confessional statement under section 164 of the Code. He started recording the statement of the accused at around 5.10 p.m. and completed it at 6.15 p.m. and it was read over to the accused.  Thereafter, in his presence the accused put his signature. The statement exhibit 3,  the signature of the accused  and the Magistrate exhibits 3/1 and 3/3 respectively.<br/> <br/>In cross examination he stated that he himself filled up the Column No. 2 of the Form. Accused Awal was arrested on August 31, 2002 in the morning at around 6.00 a.m. The Officer-in-charge of Shakipur Police Station forwarded him. He denied that it was not a fact that he recorded the statement of accused Awal without observing the provision of law and the statement of the accused Awal was not true and voluntary.<br/>P.W. 15 Monwara Begum was tendered.<br/> <br/>P.W.16 Md.Akram Hossain Sub-Inspector of Police stated that on August 31, 2002 he was attached to Shakipur Police Station and the case was entrusted to him for investigation. During investigation; he prepared the inquest report of the dead body of the victim. He proved the inquest report as exhibit 4 and his signature so endorsed thereon and was marked as exhibit 4/1. He visited the place of occurrence; he drew sketch map thereof with index and proved the sketch map and index as exhibits 5 and 6 and his signatures so endorsed thereon as exhibits 5/1 and 6/1 respectively. He seized the alamat and prepared seizure lists and proved the same as exhibits 7 and 8 series and his signature so endorsed thereon as exhibit 7/1 and 8/1 respectively. He recorded the statements of five witnesses under section 161 of the Code. He arrested the accused Abdul Awal, produced before the Court of Magistrate. The Magistrate recorded the statement of the accused  Awal under  section 164 of the Code. He duly sent the dead body to the General Hospital, Tangile for autopsy. He also collected the post mortem report of the victim. He further deposed that he got the <em>prima facie</em> case against accused. Awal and on November 8, 2002 he submitted charge sheet against the accused Awal under section 11(ka) of the Ain, 2000. <br/> <br/>In his cross examination he stated that he prepared the inquest report on August 31, 2002 at around 8.15 Rafiqul, Shah Alam, Halim were present as witnesses and they put their signatures. He sent Awal to the Magistrate on 31.8.2002 at 12.15. He seized the alamats on the bed of accused Awal on 31.8.2002 at 10.15. He denied that it was not a fact that he did not investigate the case properly.<br/> <br/>P.W.17 Khadija stated that accused Awal murdered his wife victim Hamida with a hammer and the accused confessed his guilt to all.<br/> <br/>Most of the P.Ws were thoroughly cross-examined by the defence but nothing was found to doubt their evidence. Moreover, the convict appellant  Awal made confessional statement under section 164 of the Code (exhibit 3) where he disclosed that he hit the victim Hamida with a hammer and killed her.<br/> <br/>In the case there is no ocular evidence witnessing the commission of crime by convict-appellant. Prosecution relied upon circumstantial evidence in proof of its case. It is always to be remembered that there is no law that commission of a crime must by witnessed by witnesses and they are to stand in witness box to prove the crime. Commission of crime can be also, well proved by the circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence is more cogent and convincing than the ocular evidence. It is correctly said that witnesses may tell a lie and it is not difficult to procure false, tutored and biased witness but it was very much difficult to procure circumstantial evidence.<br/>Prosecution in proof of guilt of offence relied upon the following circumstances:</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;"><u>First Circumstance:</u> Victim and convict-appellant were admittedly husband and wife and they lived in the same house at the time of commission of offence. Ordinarily an accused has no obligation to account for the death for which he is placed on trial but in a wife murder case position of law is altogether different. The murder having taken place while the convict-appellant was living with the victim wife Hamida in the same house, the convict-appellant had an obligation to explain how his wife met with death. From the above, the legitimate conclusion that inevitably flows is that it is the husband convict-appellant who had killed his wife victim Hamida. </li><li style="text-align: justify;"><u>Second Circumstance:</u> Medical evidence: Dr. Md. Abdul Hamid (PW 8) found injuries on her skull and brain matter was partially out, fracture of right and left parietal bone of the skull. Bruise on the right shoulder and upper arm. Bruise on posterior aspect of right elbow. Fracture of right and left parietal bones were also found. Blood clot underneath the scalp and skull cavity were found. Right eye is protruded out and lacerated and congested right mandice.  He recorded opinion that the victim died due to haemorrhage and shock which was homicidal and atemortem in nature. </li><li style="text-align: justify;"><u>Third Circumstance:</u> Convict-appellant did not even lodge any information to police station in respect of the death of his wife victim Hamida or took any medical help for saving the life of the victim and this conduct speaks volumes against him and inference of guilt of convict-appellant can be easily gathered. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Circumstance noted above do not at all suggest innocence of convict-appellant rather formidably suggest his involvement in the murder of his wife Hamida and all the circumstances taken together unerringly point to guilt of convict-appellant and the irresistible conclusion that flows is that convict-appellant is perpetrator of crime who killed his wife victim Hamida. <br/> <br/>The Tribunal found the husband A. Awal guilty of offence of section 11(Ka) of the Ain of 2000 and convicted him thereunder. Consequential sentence was gallows.<br/> <br/>This brings us to a legal aspect of the matter. Convict-appellant stood charged and convicted for offence of section 11(ka) of the Ain of 2000. Section 11(Ka) enjoins that if the husband of a woman or the father, mother, guardian, relations or any other person on behalf of the husband for dowry causes death to a woman or ventures to cause death or causes hurt or have a try to cause hurt that  husband, father, mother, guardian, relation or the person (a) shall stand sentenced to death for causing death or shall stand sentenced to imprisonment for life for mounting endeavor to cause death and in both the counts he shall be, also, liable to pay fine, and (b) shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life for causing hurt or be sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for a period not more than fourteen (14) years and less than five (5) years for striving to cause hurt and in both counts shall be liable to fine.<br/> <br/>In order to attract section 11(Ka) it is to be proved that death was caused in view of demand of dowry put forward from the side of husband or father, mother, guardian, or relation of the husband or any person for and on behalf of husband. <br/> <br/>In the case putting forward demand of dowry by convict-appellant could not be proved by legal evidence. P.Ws 1, 3 and 4 mother, uncles and PW 9 aunt of victim Hamida, would have been the best witnesses to testify the demand of dowry by convict appellant and they are hearsay witnesses but they did not disclose how they came to know regarding demand of dowry by convict appellant on the date of occurrence.<br/> <br/>This takes us to a legal debate of fundamental character, which is,</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the convict-appellant can be graced with a verdict of acquittal when charge of section 11(Ka) of the Ain of 2000 could not be pressed into service against him.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">When a clear case of murder has been established by the confessional statement recorded under section 164 of the code by the accused and medical evidence against him whether the convict-appellant can be convicted for the offence of murder punishable under section 302 of the Penal Code.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the case is required to be sent back to Tribunal or Court of Sessions for fresh trial. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Section 25 of the Ain of 2000 postulates that Tribunal defined section 2 (Ghha=W) shall be treated as Court of Sessions and Tribunal shall be able to exercise all powers of Sessions Court in holding trial of an offence.<br/> <br/>Section 26 of the Ain of 2000 enshrines that Tribunal so constituted shall be recorded as Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal and shall be constituted with one Judge and Judge of Tribunal shall be appointed from amongst District and Sessions Judges to the Government and Government, if necessary, shall appoint any District and Sessions Judge as Tribunal Judge in addition to his charge. Section 20 further enjoins that under the section Additional District and Sessions Judge shall, also, stand included as District and Sessions Judge.<br/> <br/>From the above it becomes manifestly clear that a Tribunal trying a case under the Ain of 2000 is, also, a Court of District and Sessions Judge. When a Judge sits in a Tribunal or Special Tribunal Case holding trial of an offence under a Statute or Special Statute is a Tribunal or Special Tribunal and a Judge when sits in Sessions Case trying an offence punishable under Penal sections of Penal Code sits as Sessions Judge.<br/> <br/>The case in hand, although, tried by a Tribunal constituted under the Ain of 2000 that Tribunal was, also, the Court of sessions. In the judgment learned judge was described as District and Sessions Judge, Tangail as well as Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Bishesh Adalat, Feni. Judgment demonstrates that learned District and Sessions Judge had been, also, exercising the power and jurisdiction of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal. Fate of the convict-appellant and result of the case would have been the same whether it would have been tried either as a Nari-O-Shishi case by the Tribunal or as a Sessions case by learned Sessions Judge of Tribunal and if section 11(ka) of The Ain, 2000 was not attracted in respect of convict-appellant, the offence of section 302 of the Penal Code could be very much pressed into service against the convict-appellant and he could be conveniently tried and convicted for offence of section  302 of the Penal Code. <br/> <br/>In <strong><em>Asiman Begum Vs State</em></strong> represented by <strong><em>Deputy Commissioner, 51 DLR(AD) 18</em></strong> the accused-appellant along with 6 others was put on trial before Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Bishesh Adalat, Patuakhali to answer a charge of section 10(1) of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain, 1995  in Nari-O-Shishu Case No. 2 of 1996. Accused-appellant was found guilty under the first part of section 304 of the Penal Code and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for four (4) years and, also, a fine of Taka 1,000 in default of payment of fine to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one (1) year more. A single Judge of High Court Division disposing of the Criminal appeal preferred by convict-appellant observed that the trial had been vitiated for want of jurisdiction inasmuch as Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishesh Bidhan) Adalat, could only try an offence under the aforesaid Bishesh Bidhan Ain, 1995 and not an offence under The Penal Code, learned Single Judge sent the case back on remand to learned Sessions Judge to try it in accordance with law. Before Appellate Division it was argued from side of accused-appellant that the remand order for trial of the case as a Sessions Case in the particular circumstances of the case will be a mere formality because Nari-O-Shishu Case No. 2 of 1996, although, tried under Bishesh Bidhan Ain, 1995 by a Bishesh Adalat, the presiding officer was no other than the Sessions Judge himself and, as such, it was unlikely that the result would be anything different if the case was tried by him as a Sessions Case. Appellate Division found considerable substance in the submission of learned Advocate for accused-appellant. Appellate Division, thus sent the appeal to High Court Division to consider the case on merit and to pass whatever order or orders it might think appropriate in the interest of justice.<br/> <br/>In <strong><em>State Vs Abul Kalam</em></strong>, <strong><em>5 BLC 230</em></strong> one Abul Kalam stood convicted for offence of section 10(1) of The Ain of 1995 for murder of his wife for dowry by learned Sessions Judge and Special Tribunal No. 1, Noakhali. Conse-quential sentence was death. Condemned-prisoner preferred Jail appeal and, also, regular Criminal appeal before High Court Division. There had been, also, Death Reference. A Division Bench of High Court Division heard Death Reference, Jail Appeal and Criminal Appeal together and disposed of those by a common Judgment. High Court Division found that there had not been cogent evidence as to committing murder for dowry and no evidence had been led as to the real cause of killing of wife by husband and held that the case did not come under section 10(1) of The Ain of 1995 and the case comes under section 302 of The Penal Code. The High Court Division further held that Sessions Judge, in fact, was the Special Tribunal No. 1 who tried the case and for no fault of the accused the case had been tried as Special Tribunal Case. High Court Division instead of sending the case back for fresh trial under section 302 of The Penal Code by learned Sessions Judge disposed of the appeal. High Court Division altered conviction from section 10(1) of The Ain, 1995 to one under section 302 of Penal Code. Sentence of death was altered to one of imprisonment for life. The High Court Division in rendering decision took into account <strong><em>Asiman Begum vs State, (Supra).</em></strong><br/> <br/>A similar question was, also, considered in <strong><em>Shibu Pada Acharjee Vs. State, 56 DLR 285</em></strong>. In the said case, accused-appellant was convicted for offence of Section 4(c) of The Ordinance of 1983 for commission of rape upon victim Ratna Rani but ingredients of Section 4(c) of the Ordinance of 1983 could not brought home to accused appellant. In the case it had been laid down:<br/><em>“To take the prosecution out of Court on a question of technicality, will be a traversity of justice and technicality must bend to cause of justice inasmuch as fact of law is justice”.</em><br/> <br/>Accused appellant can be fastened for offence of section 376 of the Penal Code and conviction under section 4(c) of The Ordinance of 1983 can be altered to one of section 376 of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/>In the said case conviction under section 4 (c) of the Ordinance of 1983 was altered to one of section 376 of the Penal Code. <strong><em>Asiman Begum vs State, (Supra) </em></strong>and <strong><em>State Vs Abul Kalam, (Supra</em></strong>) had been, also, discussed considered and meditated in <strong><em>Shibupada</em></strong><strong><em> Acharjee Vs. State (supra).</em></strong><br/> <br/>In the event of sending the case either to Tribunal or Court of Sessions for fresh trial proceeding would be protracted which cannot be allowed in the interest of true dispensation of criminal Justice.<br/> <br/>Since offence of murder is punishable under section 302 of the Penal Code was carried to the door of convict appellant he can be very much convicted for offence of section 302 of the Penal Code and, as such, we convert the offence of section 11(ka) of the Ain of 2000 to offence of section 302 of the Penal Code. Convict appellant, thus stands convicted for offence of section 302 of the Code.<br/> <br/>Legal debate stands solved in the following terms and language:</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">Convict appellant can not be graced with a verdict of acquittal.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Convict appellant can be convicted for the offence punishable under section 302 of the Penal Code</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Case is not required to be sent either to Tribunal or Court of Sessions for fresh trial. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">What sentence is to be imposed upon convict-appellant—death or imprisonment for life?<br/> <br/>Sentencing discretion on the part of a Judge is the most difficult task to perform. There is no system or procedure in the Criminal Justice administration method or Rule to exercise such discretion. In sentencing process, two important factors come out which shall shape appropriate sentence a. Aggravating factor, and b. Mitigating factor. These two factors control the sentencing process to a great extent. But it is always to be remembered that the object of sentence should be to see that the crime does not go unpunished and the society has the satisfaction that justice has been done and Court responded to the society’s cry for justice. Under section 302 of The Code, though, a discretion has been conferred upon the Court to award two types of sentences, death or imprisonment for life, the discretion is to be exercised in accordance with the fundamental principle of criminal justice.<br/> <br/>Record indicates that convict-appellant is not a hard criminal and he cannot be at all characterised to be a menace to the society. Taking an account of aggravating and mitigating circumstance, we are of this considered view that ends of justice will be met if death sentence is altered to one at imprisonment for life. Convict-appellant thus, stands sentenced to imprisonment for life.

P.C) to this Court. The reference has been numbered as Death Reference No. 114 of 2008.<br/> <br/>The learned Judge of Nari-0-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal No. 1, Dhaka found the condemned prisoner, namely, Md. Golam Sarwar @ Ripon guilty of the charge under section 11(Ka) of the Nari-0-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 and convicted and sentenced him thereunder to death in Nari-0-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Case No. 569 0f 2003, arising out of Savar P.S. Case No.43 of 2003 corresponding to G.R. No. 113. <br/> <br/>The Death Reference No. 114 of 2008 with Jail appeal No. 999 of 2008 have been heard together and are being disposed of by this common judgment. <br/> <br/>The prosecution case, in short, is that, the victim  Maksuda Akhter Moni @ Sonia was given in marriage to the condemned prisoner Md. Golam Sarwar on 24.06 1993. After marriage, the condemned prisoner used to demand dowry now and then. For the shake of peace in the family, the informant paid Tk. 25,000/ and Tk. 30,000/ in two occasions, total Tk. 55,000/- to the condemned prisoner. But again the condemned prisoner demanded dowry of Tk. 50,000/- and he used to create pressure upon the deceased for dowry now and then. The informant’s sister (deceased) informed this matter to the Unit Deputy Leader of Savar Cantonment and the Unit Deputy Leader settled the matter between the deceased and the condemned prisoner. Again, the condemned prisoner became interested for his paramour (accused No. 2 Most. Sumi Akhter, since acquitted) and at the instigation of accused No. 2, the condemned prisoner assaulted his wife (deceased) mercilessly on the previous night of the occurrence. On the following day at 9.00 A.M, the deceased informed to the Unit Deputy Leader of Savar Cantonment that she was assaulted and Unit Deputy Leader called the accused and Maksuda Akhter Moni @ Sonia (since deceased) in his office, revoked the condemned prisoner and settled the matter and asked them to go home back. Thereafter, they came back home. The condemned prisoner confined the deceased in a room, beat her and killed her by way of strangulation. In order to divert the allegation of killing, the condemned prisoner hanged the dead body of the deceased with the ceiling fan. Thereafter, one U. D. Case No. 2 of 2003 dated 18.01.2003 was recorded and on the basis of that U.D. Case, inquest report and post mortem reports were prepared. On hearing the news, the informant went to the place of occurrence. He came to know about the occurrence from Shammi Akhter Shova (P.W. 2), daughter of the deceased and the condemned prisoner and also from surrounding people. Thereafter, he brought the dead body to his house and buried her. He then went to the police station for lodging the F.I.R. but police refused to take the F.I.R. Thereafter, he filed a petition of complaint before the Nari-0-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Dhaka.<br/> <br/>The learned Judged of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjaton Daman Tribunal sent the petition of complaint to the Thana and directed to treat the same as F.I.R.<br/> <br/>On the basis of the aforesaid F.I.R, police recorded the Savar Police Station Case No. 43 dated 24.02.2003 under section 11(Ka) /30 read with section 201 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/> <br/>Md. Firoj Talukder, Sub-Inspector of police, Savar police station took charge of the investigation of the case.<br/> <br/>During investigation he visited the place of occurrence, prepared the sketch map with separate index thereof, examined the witnesses and recorded their statements under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and finally submitted charge sheet against the accused as a <em>prima facie </em>case was made out against them.<br/> <br/>During trial the learned Judge of the Nari-0-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal No.1, Dhaka framed charge against the condemned prisoner and accused Most. Sumi Akhter under section 11(Ka) and 11(Ka)/30 of the Nari-0-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000. The charge was read over and explained to the accused to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/> <br/>After close of recording of the evidence, the accused were examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and this time also they repeated their innocence.<br/> <br/>The defence case as it transpires from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses is that of innocence. Further case of the defence, is that, the deceased committed sui-side and the condemned prisoner was not involved in this case.<br/> <br/>To bring home culpability against the accused, the prosecution has examined as many as 11 witnesses in this case. The defence however, did not examine any witness.<br/> <br/>Considering the facts , circumstances and the evidence on record the learned Judge of the Nari-0-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal No.1, Dhaka found the condemned prisoner guilty of the charge under section 11(Ka) of the Nari-0-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 and convicted and sentenced him to death.<br/> <br/>The learned Judge of the Nari-0-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal No.1, Dhaka, however, found accused Most. Sumi Akhter not guilty and acquitted her of the charge.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 30.10.2008, the condemned prisoner has preferred Jail Appeal No.999 of 2008. The condemned prisoner has also been provided with the State Defence Lawyer as per the provisions of Legal Remembrancer’s Manual, 1960.<br/> <br/>Dr. Md. Bashirullah, learned D.A.G, Mrs. Yeadia Zaman, learned A.A.G. and Mr. Md. Shamim Ahsan, learned A.A.G. appeared on behalf of the State. Mrs. Yeadia Zaman, the learned Assistant Attorney General supporting the reference and opposing the Jail Appeal No. 999 of 2008 first took us through the F.I.R, charge, evidence on record, statement of Most. Shammi Akhter Shova (P.W. 2) under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, inquest report, post mortem report and other relevant papers. She then submits as under:</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">this is a wife killing case and that the deceased died in the house of her husband;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">the husband did not give any satisfactory explanation as to how his wife meet with death;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">since the wife died in the house of her husband, the irresistible conclusion is that none else but the husband killed his wife.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The prosecution has been able to prove the case against the condemned prisoner beyond reasonable doubt and that the learned Judge of the Tribunal has correctly convicted and sentenced the accused to death and there is no good ground to interfere with the impugned judgment and order dated 30.10.2008 passed by the learned Judge of the Nari-0-shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal No.1, Dhaka by this court.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>With these few wards the learned A.A.G. prays for acceptance of the reference and dismissal of the Jail Appeal No. 999 of 2008.<br/> <br/>The learned A.A.G. also refers to the following cases:</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Abdul Quddus Vs the State, reported in 43 DLR (AD) 234;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">the State Vs.Ful Miah, reported in 5 BLC (AD) 41;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Abul Hossain Vs.

However, Mr. Sarwar Ahmed submits as under:</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">this is a case under section 11(Ka) of the Nari-0-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000, and that the demand of dowry has not been proved by the prosecution and as such the conviction and sentence to death given by the Tribunal cannot sustain in law;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">in fact, the present case is a case of no evidence and that the learned Judge of the Tribunal convicted and sentenced the condemned prisoner merely on surmise and conjecture;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">the learned Judge of the Tribunal believing the solitary evidence of P.W. 2, namely, Shammi Akhter Shova, who is minor girl of 9 years, convicted and sentenced the condemned prisoner the highest punishment of death;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">in law the testimony of a child witness can be taken into consideration only when corroborative evidence is available, but in the instant case such corroborative evidence is totally absent;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">in a wife killing case, the minimum the prosecution is required to prove is that the husband was present in the place of the occurrence, at the time of occurrence but in the instant case there is no evidence on record to show that the husband was present at the place of occurrence, when the occurrence took place;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">according to the post mortem report the deceased committed suicide and there is nothing to disbelieve the expert opinion, that is, the opinion of the doctor in the present case.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> With these few wards the learned advocate prays for rejection of the reference and allow the jail appeal.<br/> <br/>The learned advocate also refers to the case of this following cases:</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Abu Taher Chowdhury and others Vs. the State, reported in 11 BLD (AD) 2;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mahbub Alam Vs. the State, reported in 15 BLD (AD) 54;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Md.

He did not find any documentary evidence to show that the condemned prisoner demanded dowry. He denied the suggestion that the victim committed suicide. He also denied the suggestion that he deposed falsely being biased by the informant.<br/>These are all the evidence adduced by the prosecution.<br/>Now, in order to ascertain whether the prosecution has been able to prove the case against the condemned prisoner, let us now carefully analyse and scrutinize the evidence adduced by the prosecution.<br/>Out of 11 P.Ws, P.W. 1 is Md. Enayet Hossain. He is the informant.<br/>P.W. 2 Shammi Akhter Shova is the minor daughter of the deceased and the condemned prisoner. She is supposed to be the eye-witness to the occurrence.<br/>P.W. 3 is the private witness and neighbor.<br/>P.W. 4 is also a private witness and neighbor.<br/>P.W. 5 is an A.S.I. He verified the name and address of the father of the condemned prisoner, that is, Akkas Ali Howlader.<br/>P.W. 6 is also an A.S.I. of Police. He also verified the name and address of Sumi Akhter.<br/>P.W. 7 is a Constable of Police who brought the dead body of the deceased to Dhaka Medical College Hospital for post mortem examination.<br/>P.W. 8 is the Magistrate who recorded the statement of witness Shammi Akhter Shova (P.W. 2) under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/>P.W. 9 is Sub-Inspector of Police and he is the Investigating Officer.<br/>P.W. 10 is Dr. Md. Mizanur Rahman. He proved the post mortem examination.<br/>P.W. 11 is also a Sub-Inspector of Police. He investigated the U.D. Case No. 2 of 2003.<br/> <br/>P.W. 1 is the brother of the deceased and he used to serve in Barisal Zila Parishad. He heard about the occurrence from P.W. 2 and local people and filed the petition of complaint one month 7 days after the occurrence. The occurrence took place any time before 12.00 O’clock on 18.01.2003. He stated that he paid Tk. 55,000/- as dowry to the condemned prisoner. On hearing about the incident, he came to Dhaka on 19.01.2003 and went to the Police Station on 26.01.2003. But the Police refused to record his FIR and thereafter on 28.01.2003 he filed the petition of complaint before the Court. P.W. 2 Shammi Akhter Shova is the most important witness in this case. At the time of the occurrence she used to study in class-III and she was 9 and half years old. She stated that on 17.01.2003, there was a quarrel between her father and the mother. Her father assaulted her mother. On the following day, that is, on 18.01.2003, her mother lodged a complaint before the army officer. The army officer settled the matter and sent them to their home. Her mother and father went to the bed room and they (this P.W. 2 and her sister) were staying at the adjacent room. She saw through the hole of the door that her father pressed the neck of her mother. She went on saying that Sumi Akhter and her grandfather helped her father to hang her mother with the ceiling fan. This statement of P.W. 2 has not been corroborated by any other witnesses. Police did not find any prima-facie case against the father of the condemned prisoner and accordingly police submitted final report against him. Again, Sumi Akhter has been acquitted by the Court. Therefore, the statement of P.W. 2 in respect of her grandfather and the accused Sumi Akhter that they helped her father to hang the body of her mother with the ceiling fan does not stand good. P.W. 2 informed the matter to her aunty who used to live in the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor of the same building. The unit people came there and pulled the dead body down. After the occurrence P.W. 2 was under the custody of the informant. The occurrence took place on 18.01.2003 and she deposed in the Court on 31.08.2004. Therefore, it appears that this P.W. 2 deposed before the Court one year 7 months after the occurrence and during this time she was under the custody of the informant. P.W. 2 was a child when she deposed before the Court. Law is clear how far a child witness can be relied upon. Section 118 of the Evidence Act gives in details who are competent to testify.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>Section 118 of the Evidence Act reads as follows:</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“All persons shall be competent to testify unless the Court considers that they are prevented from understanding the questions put to them, or from giving rational answers to those questions, by tender year, extreme old age, disease, whether of body or mind, or any other cause of the same kind.”</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">The consistent view of the top Courts is that the evidence of a child witness can be taken into consideration as evidence by prudent corroboration of such witness. In the case of Rashid Ahmed Vs The State, 10 DLR 532=PLD 1959 181 it has been held that the evidence of a child witness is not reliable unless corroborated. The evidence of a child witness, direct or circumstantial, should not be relied upon unless it is corroborated.<br/> <br/>Similar view has been held in the case of Gadu Mia Vs The State, 44 DLR246; In the case referred to above, it has been held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“the competence of a child as a witness is beyond question. The only thing that requires to be done is to scrutinize his evidence with care and caution to see whether it suffers from any inconsistency. To base conviction upon his evidence it is prudent to seek corroboration”.</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">So, according to the above pronounc-ements, we are required to look for corroboration of the evidence of P.W. 2. P.W. 3 is the neighbor who came to the place of occurrence. Obviously she did not see the occurrence as she came to the place of occurrence after the occurrence was over. P.W. 4 also did not see the occurrence and she did not know who killed the victim. P.Ws. 5 and 6 are the A.S.I. of police. They verified the name and address of the accused. P.W. 7 is police constable who brought the dead body of the deceased to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital for autopsy. P.W. 8 is the Magistrate who recorded the statement of the witness, that is, P.W. 2, under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. P.W. 9 is the investigating officer. P.W.10 is the doctor but he did not prepare the post mortem report. He just knew the hand writing of doctor, Md. Mizanur Rahman who prepared the post mortem report. P.W. 11 is the investigating officer of the U.D. case. If we carefully analyse and scrutinize the above evidence of P.Ws, we do not get prudent corroboration of the evidence of P.W. 2. However, the learned Deputy Attorney General argues that since it is a wife killing case, the husband is required to explain how his wife met with her death. In support of his contention, the learned D.A.G refers to a case of Abdul Motleb HowladerVs The State, 5 MLR(AD) 362= 6BLC(AD) 1. In the case referred to above, the Appellate Division has held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“It is well settled that ordinarily an accused has no obligation to account for the death for which he is placed on trial. The murder having taken place while the condemned prisoner was living with his wife in the same house he was under an obligation to explain how his wife had met with her death. In the absence of any explanation coming from his side it seems none other than the husband was responsible for causing death in question”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Ilias Hussain (Md) Vs The State, 54 DLR (AD) 78, the Appellate Division has held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“It is well settled that when a wife met with an unnatural death while in custody of the husband and also while in his house the husband is to explain under what circumstance the wife met with her death”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Similar view has been expressed in the case of State Vs. Kalu Bepari, 43 DLR 249. In the case referred to above, a Division Bench of this Court has held as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“The murder having taken place while the condemned prisoner was living with his wife in the same house he was under an obligation to explain how his wife had met with her death. In the absence of any explanation coming from his side it seems none other than the husband was responsible for causing death of his wife.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Abul Hossain Vs The State, reported in 14 MLR(AD) 30, it has been held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“It appears that the victim was the wife of the accused petitioner who was done to death is in the house of the accused petitioner while the accused petitioner was present in the house. Therefore, the court below rightly held that the petitioner was under obligation to explain how his wife was done to death. ”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>There is no controversy about the decisions cited above. However, the learned Lawyer appearing for the condemned prisoner refers the case of State Vs. Khadem Mondal, 1996 BLD (AD) 228.<br/> <br/>In the case of the State Vs. Khadem Mondal, 1990 BLD (AD) 228, it has been held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“In this case there was no eye-witness of the occurrence and the only circumstance found in the case against the husband is that, the death occurred in the night of the occurrence in the house of the accused respondent. But none of the witness specifically stated that Khadem Mondal was present either in the night of the occurrence or in the early morning when the witness went to the house of Khadem Mondal. All the witnesses stated that they heard about the death from the accused persons and the accused persons did not disclose the cause of death. It is true that the wife died in the house of the husband and the defence did not give any satisfactory explanation as to how the deceased died in the house in the night of the occurrence. <u>But for that fact alone, it is difficult to conclusively fix the liability with the husband</u>”.</em>(emphasis supplied)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From the above pronouncements, it is clear that in a wife’s killing case the husband is under an obligation to explain how his wife met with her death. But to make the husband liable for the death of his wife, the minimum fact that must be brought on record that the husband was present at home at the relevant time. In the case of the State, represented by the Solicitor to the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh Vs. Md. Shafiqul Islam alias Rafique and another, 43 DLR (AD) 92, the Appellate Division has held as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Where it is proved that the wife died of assault in the house of her husband, there would be strong suspicion against the husband that at his hands the wife died.  To make the husband liable, <u>the minimum fact that must be brought on record, either by direct or circumstantial evidence, is that he was in the house at the relevant time.</u>”</em>(emphasis supplied)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of the State Vs. Mofazzal  Hossain Pramanik, 43 DLR (AD) 65, the Appellate Division has held as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“In this case how much the respondent could explain the circumstances in which his wife died depended on where he was at the material time. When the prosecution failed to prove that the accused was in his house where his wife was murdered he cannot be saddled with any onus to prove his innocence. Had it been established by evidence that the accused was in his house at the material time, pointing a finger at him as the probable assailant, then the Court could have in deciding the matter considered his failure to adduce explanation or the falsity of his explanation along with other incriminating circumstances.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the above case, it was further held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“That Halima died of assault in the house of the respondent is proved. No doubt, strongest suspicion will be against the respondent that at his hands Halima died. <u>But to make him liable, the minimum fact that must be brought on record, either by direct or circumstantial evidence that he was in the house at the relevant time or night.</u>”(emphasis supplied)</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of The State Vs Azizur Rahman alias Habib, reported in 20 BLD-467, it has been held that the defence of alibi of the condemned prisoner was not established even then the responsibility of the prosecution does not diminish in establishing its case that it was the accused who was responsible for commission of offence.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate for the defence also submits that the accused was not present at the place of occurrence when the occurrence took place. P.W. Nos. 3 and 4 who are the neighours came to place of occurrence but did not find the accused in the place of occurrence.<br/> <br/>It has been settled by the different pronouncements of the top Courts that if an exception is pleaded by an accused the onus is upon him to prove such plea. Sections 103 and 106 of the Evidence Act clearly indicate that under the law an obligation is cast upon the accused to prove the special plea of alibi by adducing evidence. It will be profitable to cite the correct interpretation of law in respect of prosecution case and the special plea of defence as has been laid down by Chief Justice Gajendragadkar,  reported in AIR 1966 (SC) 97 at para (15) which runs as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“It will be recalled that it was with a view to emphasizing the fundamental doctrine of Criminal Law that the onus to prove its case lies on the prosecution, that Viscount Sankey in Woolmington Vs Director of Public Prosecutions, 1935 AC 462, observed that, “no matter what the charge or where the trial, the principle that the prosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner is part of the common law of England and no attempt to whittle it down can be entertained”. This principle of common law is a part of the criminal law in this country That is not to say that if an exception is pleaded by an accused person, he is not required to justify his plea; but the degree and character of proof which the accused is expected to furnish in support of his plea, cannot be equated with the degree and character of proof expected from the prosecution which is required to prove its case.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From the above pronouncements, we are of the opinion that though in a wife killing case, the condemned prisoner is liable to explain how his wife met with death, the prosecution is equally responsible to prove the case beyond doubt and the prosecution is also responsible to prove that the accused was present at the place of occurrence when the occurrence took place.<br/> <br/>In the instant case P.W. Nos. 3 and 4 are independent witnesses and they are the neighbours of the condemned prisoner and the deceased. They came to the place of occurrence immediately after the occurrence. P.W. 3 stated in her cross-examination that when she came to the place of occurrence she did not find any male member there. P.W. 4 also did not state anything that the condemned prisoner was present at the place of occurrence when occurrence took place. So, in the absence of any evidence that the condemned prisoner was present at the place of occurrence when the occurrence took place, it is difficult to hold that none else but the condemned prisoner is responsible for killing of his wife.  Now, we may turn to other important legal point.<br/> <br/>The learned advocate appearing for the condemned prisoner submits that the symptoms appeared in the dead body of the deceased correspond to suicidal hanging. The inquest report has been proved as Ext. 11. In Ext. 11 it has been stated as under: <strong>মৃত মাকসুদা অাক্তার সোনিয়া (২৭) স্বামী কর্পোরাল গোলাম সরোয়ার ১৯ ইস্ট বেঙ্গল সাপোর্ট ব্যাটালিয়ন সাভার সেনানিবাস সাভার ঢাকা এর লাশের সুরতহাল রিপোর্ট তৈরি করি লাশটির চোখ বন্ধ গলায় বাম দিকে ফাঁসির দাগ পরিলক্ষিত হয় গলার পিছনের দিকের চামড়া ছোলা, কানের লতি ছেড়া, মুখ সামান্য খোলা ও উপরের পাটির দাঁত দেখা যাইতেছিলz হাতের তালুতে কালচে দাগ এবং শরীরের বিভিন্ন সÛানে নীল যা সবুজ দাগ, পায়খানা ও বীর্য নির্গত হইয়াছিল পরনের কাপড় ভেজা ছিল উহাতে প্রসাব হইয়াছে বলিয়া ধারনা হয়z এই প্রতিবেদন অামি সাক্ষীদের মোকাবেলা তৈরী করিয়াছি ও সাক্ষীদের স্বাক্ষর গ্রহণ করিz লাশ শনাক্ত করিয়াছিল সাক্ষীগনz এই লেখা ও দস¹খত অামার সুরতহাল রিপোর্ট প্রঃ নং-১১ এবং দস¹খত প্রঃ নং-১১/১ হইল.</strong><br/> <br/>In the post mortem report, it has been stated as under:</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"> One lacerated wound ½” X ¼” X ¼” over left ear Lobule (place of ear ring torn)</li><li style="text-align: justify;"> Bleeding from right ear lobule present (at the site of ear ring)</li><li style="text-align: justify;"> One oblique fade non-continuous ligature mark impression 1 ¼” breath is present (at high up in the neck with a gap of 3 ½” on left upper lateral neck with a knot mark impression 1 ¼”X ½” over under surface of mandible (left side)</li><li style="text-align: justify;"> One buries ½” X ½” over lateral aspect of right lower arm 3” above right elbow joint.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"> One buries 3 ½” X 1 ½” over medial aspect of right leg. 3” below right knee joint.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"> One buries 2” X ½” over medial aspect of left middle leg below left knee joint.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"> One lacerated wound ½” X ¼” soft tissue depth is present over posterior aspect of right lower anterior chest wall at back at 7<sup>th</sup> thoracic vertebra level. 4” to the right of midline at back.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">In the opinion the doctors opined that death was due to respiratory failure following asphyxia as a result of ante-mortem hanging which was consistent with ante-mortem suicidal hanging. The injuries present on different region of the body were ante-mortem in nature and are suggestive of the fact that the deceased was subjected to blunt trauma during life.<br/> <br/>In the post mortem report the doctor in no uncertain term stated that death was due to respiratory failure, following asphyxia as a result of ante-mortem hanging what was consistent with ante-mortem suicidal hanging.<br/> <br/>The ligature mark was found non-continuous. This non-continuous ligature mark is confirmatory to suicidal hanging. Therefore, there is nothing to disbelieve the doctor and discard the post mortem report.<br/> <br/>Now, let us turn another important point whether the condemned prisoner demanded dowry at the time of the occurrence and whether the case falls within the mischief of section 11(ka) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjaton Daman Ain, 2000 (as amended in 2003). Section 11(Ka) of the Nari-0-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 is as follows: <em>“</em><strong>যোতুকের জন্য মৃত্যু ঘটানো, ইত্যাদির শাসি¹z যদি কোন নারীর স্বামী অথবা স্বামীর পিতা, মাতা, অভিভাবক, আত্মীয় বা স্বামীর পক্ষে অন্য কোন ব্যক্তি যো~তুকের জন্য উক্ত নারীর মৃত্যু ঘটান বা মৃত্যু ঘটানোর চেষ্টা করেন, ঞ্ছকিংবা উক্ত নারীকে</strong><strong> মারত্মক জখম (</strong><strong><em>grievous hurt</em></strong><strong>) করেন বা সাধারণ জখম (ড়ভলসরন বয়ক্ষঢ়)করেনঞ্জ তাহা হইলে উক্ত স্বামী, স্বামীর পিতা, মাতা, অভিভাবক, আত্মীয় বা ব্যক্তি- </strong><strong>(ক) মৃত্যু ঘটানোর জন্য মৃত্যুদন্ডে বা মৃত্যু ঘটানোর চেÖঢ~ার জন্য যাবজ্জীবন কারাদন্ডে দন্ডনীয় হইবেন এবং উভয় ক্ষেত্রে উক্ত দন্ডের অতিরিক্ত অর্থ দন্ডেও দন্ডনীয় হইবেন</strong><em>; </em><br/> <br/>So from the plain reading of section 11(Ka) of the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000, we find that if the death is caused for demand of dowry, it will come within the mischief of section 11(Ka) of the Ain. Now, let us see whether the prosecution has been able to prove that the accused demanded dowry or not.<br/> <br/>P.W. 1 stated that he paid Tk. 55,000/- as dowry to the condemned prisoner in two installments but he did not mention the exact date and time when the condemned prisoner demanded dowry. P.W. 1 again stated that on 17.01.2003, the condemned prisoner demanded dowry to the tune of Tk.50,000/- and he assaulted the deceased. But obviously on 17.01.2003, P.W. 1 was not present there and he was in his work place at Barisal. P.W. 2 stated that, “<strong>আমার আîুর সাথে আমার আম্মুর যৌতুকের টাকা নিয়ে ঝগড়া হয়z ১৭/০১/০৩ তারিখ শুত্র্রবার রাত্রে আমার আîু আমার আম্মুকে মারধর করে</strong>”<br/> <br/>The evidence of P.W. 2 has not been corroborated by other evidence. As she is a child witness, her evidence cannot be relied upon without corroboration. P.W. Nos. 3 and 4 are the close neighbours of the deceased and the condemned prisoner, but they did not state that the condemned prisoner demanded dowry from the deceased. The other witnesses also did not state anything about the alleged demand of dowry. Therefore, we do not find any evidence to hold that the condemned prisoner committed the offence for demand of dowry. The doctor gave the opinion that the death was due to respiratory failure following asphyxia as a result of ante-mortem hanging which was consistent with ante-mortem suicidal hanging. The opinion of the doctor is consistent with the prosecution case in as much as it is the prosecution case that on the night of 17.01.2003 condemned prisoner mercilessly beat to his wife. Therefore, the injuries present on the person of the deceased must be ante-mortem in nature. Because the condemned prisoner beat his wife on the night of 17.01.2003 when she was alive.<br/> <br/>Again, this is a case under section 11(Ka) of the Nari-0-shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000.<br/> <br/>Unfortunately, in a case under section 11(Ka) of the Nari-0-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000, the law provides the only sentence of death. No other sentence could be awarded in a case under section 11(Ka) of the Ain if the charge is proved against the accused.<br/> <br/>In the instant case admittedly there is no eye-witness except P.W. 2. It is admitted that P.W. 2 was 7 and half years old at the time of the occurrence. Even when she deposed before the court she was 9 years old. In law the testimony of a child witness cannot be relied upon without prudent corroboration and such corroboration is absent in the present case.<br/> <br/>When the question of awarding death sentence comes, the responsibility rests upon the court to sift the evidence of a child witness with full care.<br/> <br/>We have seen that the evidence of P.W. 2 has not been corroborated by any other witness. Therefore, it will not be proper to award death sentence believing the solitary un-corroborative evidence of P.W. 2 who is a child witness.<br/> <br/>The next legal question raised by the learned Advocate appearing for the accused is that the prosecution failed to prove that the accused demanded dowry before his wife was done to death. Therefore, the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal had no jurisdiction to try the case and the trial was absolutely without jurisdiction. At the time of hearing of Appeal the question arose whether the High Court Division was competent to convert a case of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjaton Daman Ain into section 302 of the Penal Code and dispose of the appeal without sending the case back on remand to try the case by the Sessions Court<br/> <br/>In the case of the State Vs. Bahar Miah, 56 DLR 455, a Division Bench of this Court held that conviction given under Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain could not be converted into one under section 302 of the Penal Code. In the case of State Vs. Eunus  Kha 5 BLC 353, a Division Bench of this Court converted conviction passed under section 10(1) of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain, 1995 into one under section 302 of the Penal Code and disposed of the Appeal. In the case of State Vs. Mannan Gazi, 6 BLC 187 another Division Bench converted a conviction passed under section 10(1) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain, 1995 into one under section 302 of the Penal Code and disposed of the Appeal. Therefore, we find that the High Court Division is divided on the point whether or not conviction under Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain can be converted into one under section 302 of the Penal Code at the appeallant stage and dispose of the Appeal. In this connection, perhaps, it will be profitable for us to place reliance upon the case of Asiman Begum Vs. State, represented by the Deputy Commissioner 51 DLR (AD)18=3MLR (AD) 286. In the case referred to above, the Appellate Division has held as under:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“We find considerable substance in the submission of the learned Advocate. The learned Judge of the High Court Division was right in holding that the (Bishesh Bidhan) Adalat under the aforesaid Ain of 1995 could not try an offence under the Penal Code and the order of conviction and sentence under section 304 of the Penal Code was, therefore, without jurisdiction. But the appellant had no hand in the matter of trial. If there was a trial in the wrong forum the responsibility must lie with the prosecution. But that does not also mean that an accused can never be tried for a second time by an appropriate Court. The better view is that when it is found after a full trial that there was a mis-trial or trial without jurisdiction, the Court of appeal before directing a fresh trial by an appropriate Court should also see whether such direction should at all be given in the facts and circumstances of a particular case. For example, if it is found that there was no legal evidence to support the conviction, then in that case it would be wholly wrong to direct a retrial because it would then be an useless exercise. Further, the prosecution should not be given a chance to fill up its lacuna by bringing new evidence which it did not or could not produce in the first trial.<br/>Even if the Court finds that there is prima-facie evidence for a fresh trial by a proper Court, then also there may be consideration for which it may not be felt appropriate to require the accused to stand a second trial. For example, if it is found that the accused had suffered a substantial part of the sentence imposed upon him or her in the mis-trial, the Court may not for ends of justice direct a retrial. There may be other extenuating circumstances, which may impel a Court to take a lenient view in favour of the accused. But there is no question that the Court has undoubted right to direct a retrial where there has not been a trial in accordance with law. A balance has, however, to be struck and that is, what is called the exercise of judicial discretion in the facts and circumstances of a particular case, a judge’s mind always swings- To be or not to be.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>As per the decision of the Appellate Division cited above, we are of the opinion that this court is competent to convert the case into suitable section of the Penal Code and dispose of the appeal on its merit.<br/> <br/>We find some circumstance in this case. First the accused had a paramour. P.W. 2 stated that on the night of 17.01.2003 her father mercilessly beat her mother. The post mortem report also shows that there are 7 injuries on the persons of the deceased. All these facts and circumstances show that the husband created a situation for which the wife was compelled to commit suicide. In fact, in the present case we find that the husband abetted the commission of offence of suicide by the wife. Therefore, in our view, this case falls within the mischief of section 306 of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/>Considering all these facts and circumstances and the evidence on record, we are of the opinion that justice will adequately be met if the condemned prisoner is found guilty of offence under section 306 of the Penal Code and he is convicted and sentenced thereunder to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 years with a fine of Tk. 1,000/-, in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 6 months more.<br/> <br/>In the result the death reference No. 114 of 2008 is rejected and the Jail Appeal No. 999 of 2008 is dismissed with the modification of sentence as mentioned above.<br/> <br/>The condemned prisoner, namely, Md. Golam Sarwar @ Ripon is found guilty of offence under section 306 of the Penal Code and he is convicted and sentenced thereunder to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10(ten) years with a fine of Tk. 1,000/- (one thousand), in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 06(six) months more. If the condemned prisoner has already served out 10(ten) years imprisonment in the meantime, he may be released from the jail custody at once if not wanted in any other case.<br/> <br/>Let a copy of this judgment be sent to the Lower Court for taking necessary action.<br/> <br/>Send down the lower court’s record at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Being the owner of the case plot, he took the initiative to build a commercial high-rise building on the said plot which would highly affect the security measure of the reputed Five-Star Hotel Westin.  At one stage, the petitioner-company requested the respondent no. 2 not to grant sanction for construction of the high-rise building in the case plot in view of the security concern of foreign guests, tourists and delegates; but the respondent no. 2 turned a deaf ear thereto. However, under compelling circumstances, on 28.09.2008, the company served a legal notice upon the respondent no.2 not to sanction any plan for construction of the multi-storied building in the case plot. The company also filed an application before the Ministry of Environment and Forest to look into the security problem of the Westin Hotel in view of the contemplated construction of the high-rise building in the case plot by the respondent no. 7 whereupon the said Ministry issued two Memos dated 22.01.2009 and 22.04.2009 to the Director-General of the Environment Directorate containing some directives. Anyway, the respondent no. 2, without making any proper inquiry as to security concern of foreign boarders of the hotel, approved of the plan submitted by the respondent no.7 vide Memo No. রাজউক/নঅঅ-২/বি-ছ৩সি-১৫১/০৯/৩৩৯ dated 11.05.2009. After obtaining the sanction from the respondent no. 2, in the first phase, the respondent no.7 demolished the two-storied building situated in the case plot.  Meanwhile, the petitioner filed Title Suit No. 6816 of 2008 in the 7<sup>th</sup> Court of Joint-District Judge, Dhaka for permanent injunction and the suit is still pending for adjudication. After the terrorist attacks on Taj Hotel and Marriott Hotel in 2008 in the neighbouring countries, the Starwood (Asia Pacific Resource Private Limited) filed an application to the then Chief Adviser of the Caretaker Government Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed on 08.12.2008 stating its anxiety regarding the safety and security of all guests staying and visiting the Westin Hotel, Dhaka. Thereafter Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed directed the concerned authority to enquire into the matter and the DGFI (Director-General of Forces Intelligence) enquired thereinto and recommended not to allow anybody to establish any high-rise building adjacent to the Hotel Westin. Be that as it may, the petitioner served a notice demanding justice upon the respondent no. 2 requesting it to cancel the sanction granted in respect of construction of the multi-storied building in the case plot, but without any result. If the contemplated multi-storied building is constructed therein, the security of foreign guests, dignitaries and tourists will be endangered and consequently Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) shall be hampered in Bangladesh. The action of the respondents in allowing the construction of the multi-storied building in the case plot by the respondent no.7 is without lawful authority and of no legal effect.<br/> <br/>The respondent no. 7 has contested the Rule by filing an Affidavit-in-Opposition. His case, as set out in the Affidavit-in-Opposition, briefly runs as follows:<br/>          The petitioner-company made a proposal to the respondent no. 7 for purchase of the case plot (admitted in Annexure-‘A’), but the said proposal was turned down by him. Having failed to purchase the case plot, the petitioner made correspondences with various authorities averring falsely that the respondent no.7 was trying to transfer the case plot in favour of a third party. Subsequently, the petitioner filed the Writ Petition by suppressing material facts with a view to compelling the respondent no. 7 to sell the case plot to the petitioner-company against his will. The intention of the petitioner in filing the Writ Petition is malafide. By the impugned action of the respondent no.2, no right of the petitioner was infringed and as such it has no locus standi to challenge the said action for its personal benefit. On 19.11.2008, the petitioner filed Title Suit No. 6816 of 2008 in the 7<sup>th</sup> Court of Joint-District Judge of Dhaka for a declaration that it has acquired easement right to light and air through the case plot stating the self-same facts of the Writ Petition and sought an order injuncting the approval of the building plan by the RAJUK and that suit is still pending for adjudication. When the matter in dispute between the parties is pending before the Civil Court for disposal, the Writ Court has no jurisdiction thereover. The apprehension of the petitioner-company that the Westin Hotel might be made targets of terrorists like the Taj Hotel and the Marriott Hotel is not correct and this has been agitated only for the purpose of filing of the Writ Petition. The Annexure-‘E’ to the Writ Petition is just an application addressed to the then Chief Adviser of the Caretaker Government. However, the contents of Annexure-‘E’ manifest that it was written just for instructing the competent authorities to look after the safety of the Westin Hotel. As per report of the DGFI (Annexure-‘E-1’), it does not indicate that the DGFI inquired into the matter and even if the DGFI conducted any inquiry thereinto, that was done behind the back of the respondent no. 7. The report of the DGFI (Annexure-‘E-1’) is just indicative of security concern of the Westin Hotel. In compliance with all relevant laws regarding construction of the high-rise building in the case plot, the respondent no.7 applied to several offices for obtaining permission to construct the same. In due course, the respondent no.7 obtained sanction to construct the multi-storied building in the case plot from the RAJUK by Memo No. RAJUK/NaAaAa-2/B-R 3C-151/09/339 dated 11.05.2009. He obtained No Objection Certificate under Memo No. KO-Aa/ANA/898/2008/46 dated 26.11.2008 from the Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (WASA). He also obtained No Objection Certificate under Memo No. DESCO/ SE&amp;D/ 2008/277 dated 20.10.2008 from the Dhaka Electric Supply Company Limited (DESCO). He further obtained permission under Memo No. B:Aa:JO:8/65 /1307 dated 15.10.2008 from the Titas Gas Transmission  &amp;  Distribution Company Limited. He also obtained permission from the Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) by Memo No. NA PA B/BAHUTAL/08/34 dated 07.10.2008 and No Objection Certificate from the local Ward Commissioner by Memo No. (KA/Aa/PA): 163/08 dated 19.08.2008. He further obtained permission from the Bangladesh Civil Aviation Authority by Memo No. caab/a-a/ats/1501/ 21/07 (sangraha-14)/1631 dated 13.08.2008 and No Objection Certificate from the Fire Service and Civil Defence Department by Memo No. fs &amp; cd/ agni/uma-81/088633 dated 06.11.2008. He also obtained Traffic Certificate from the Police Commissioner’s Office, Dhaka Metropolitan Police by Memo No. shangsthapan/195-2009/384 dated 25.01.2009. He next obtained No Objection Certificate from the Joint-Police Commissioner (Traffic) by Memo No. 119-2009/ fugma commissioner-(Traffic)/1930 dated 10.10.2008 and the same from the Deputy Commissioner (Traffic-North) by Memo No. 3237 dated 29.09.2008. Lastly, on 03.11.2008, the respondent no.7 Dr. S. A. Mahmood filed an application before the Directorate of Environment for according permission to construct the high-rise building in the case plot and accordingly, he got permission to that effect by Memo No. Paribesh/Dha-B/18628/Char-262 dated 15.02.2009 issued under the signature of one Mostafizur Rahman, Director, Environment Directorate, Dhaka; but the petitioner obtained the Rule Nisi and stay-order suppressing that fact and stating falsely  that the respondent no.7, without taking any permission from the Directorate of Environment, got his plan approved by the RAJUK for construction of the multi-storied building therein. As the Rule was obtained by committing fraud upon the court, the same is liable to be discharged. <br/> <br/>In the Affidavit-in-Reply dated 14.03.2010 to the Affidavit-in-Opposition filed on behalf of the petitioner, it has been stated  that although the Ministry of Environment and Forest instructed the Environment Directorate vide Memo dated 22.01.2009 to do the needful under intimation thereto, but the respondent no. 7 obtained “অবসহানগত ছাড়পত্র” dated 15.02.2009 from the said Directorate mysteriously. By the Memo dated 24.04.2009, the said Ministry directed the Environment Directorate not to issue any clearance certificate in favour of the respondent no. 7. Given this scenario, the “অবসহানগত ছাড়পত্র” dated 15.02.2009 issued by the Directorate of Environment is ineffective. The petitioner has the locus standi to ventilate its grievances before the Writ Court as it has the right to save its property and the lives of the boarders of the hotel. The respondent no. 7 can not give any assurance that no militant or fundamentalist will purchase any apartment of the contemplated high-rise building in the case plot to launch any attack on the Westin Hotel. Under the given circumstances, the petitioner-company is entitled to protect its property under Article 32 of the Constitution. Section 14 of the Building Construction Act, 1952 bars the jurisdiction of the Civil Court and as such the petitioner’s only remedy lies before the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution. According to Rule 45 of the ঢাকা মহানগর ইমারত নির্মাণ বিধিমালা, ২০০৬, the authority may stay the construction of multi-storied building in the case plot if the lives and properties of the neighbouring people are threatened. In the instant case, the Hotel Westin’s security and the lives of its boarders (mostly foreign) are impliedly threatened.<br/> <br/>The case of the petitioner in Writ Petition No. 6242 of 2009 briefly runs as follows:<br/>          The petitioner is the owner of the case plot and has been in possession of the same by constructing a two-storied building for about 40 years. At one point of time, he executed an agreement with the NAVANA Real Estate Ltd. in the month of June, 2008 for constructing a multi-storied building therein. Accordingly, a power-of-attorney was executed in favour of the said developer empowering it to construct the building. In compliance with the relevant laws, the petitioner obtained clearance certificates from various authorities for the purpose. Thereafter he started the construction of the multi-storied building by way of demolishing the residential building situated in the case plot. While the construction work of the building was underway, the petitioner through his developer company received a Rule-issuing order along with a stay-order from the High Court Division issued in Writ Petition No. 4020 of 2009 on 04.06.2009 filed by the Unique Hotel and Resorts Limited. On perusal of the Writ Petition 4020 of 2009, the petitioner came to learn that the Unique Hotel and Resorts Limited made a false statement to the effect that Dr. S. A. Mahmood, without approval of the Environment Directorate, was constructing the building in the case plot and mainly on the basis of that statement, the company obtained the Rule Nisi and order of stay. On 03.07.2009, the present petitioner received Memo No. PARIBESH/ DHA /18628 /PROSHASHA-1334 dated 29.06.2009 issued under the signature of one Zamshed Ahmed, Director, Directorate of Environment staying operation of the Memo containing “অবসহানগত ছাড়পত্র” by referring to the order dated 04.06.2009 passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 4020 of 2009. While the matter in question was pending before the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 4020 of 2009, on 27.08.2009 the present writ petitioner received another Memo No.  paribesh/dha bi/ 18628/proshashan-1737 dated 26.08.2009 issued under the signature of the respondent no. 4 cancelling the “অবসহানগত ছাড়পত্র” dated 15.02.2009 without issuing any show cause notice upon him or giving him any opportunity of being heard. However, on 19.11.2008, the respondent no. 6 (Unique Hotel and Resorts Limited) filed Title Suit No. 6816 of 2008 in the 7<sup>th</sup> Court of the Joint-District Judge, Dhaka for a declaration to the easement right of the Westin Hotel to light and air through the case plot and that suit is still pending for disposal. Anyway, as the impugned Memo dated 26.08.2009 is malafide and in violation of the principle of natural justice, the same is without lawful authority and of no legal effect.<br/> <br/>The respondent nos. 4, 5 and 6 have contested the Rule by filing three separate Affidavits-in-Opposition in Writ Petition No. 6242 of 2009. Their case, in short is as follows:<br/>On the basis of a complaint, the respondent no.4 cancelled the “অবসহানগত ছাড়পত্র” as the matter involved the security and safety of foreign guests, tourists and dignitaries staying in the Hotel Westin. The cancellation of the “অবসহানগত ছাড়পত্র” by the Memo dated 26.08.2009 is perfectly justified in the facts and circumstances of the case. Furthermore, the petitioner did not have recourse to the appellate authority in terms of Section 14 of the পরিবেশ সংরক্ষণ আইন, ১৯৯৫ against the impugned order of cancellation dated 26.08.2009. As the petitioner did not exhaust the appellate forum as contemplated by Section 14 of the said Ain, the Writ Petition is not maintainable. As such, the Rule is liable to be discharged.<br/> <br/>The case of the petitioner in Writ Petition No. 6338 of 2009, in brief, is as follows:<br/>          With a view to constructing a multi-storied building in the case plot, the petitioner obtained sanction from the RAJUK by Memo No. RAJUK/NaAaAa-2/B-R3C-151/09/339 dated 11.05.2009. Besides, he also obtained clearance certificates from various authorities concerned in that regard as required by relevant laws. But curiously enough, without affording him any opportunity of being heard, the RAJUK cancelled the sanction for construction of the multi-storied building in the case plot by Memo No. RAJUK/NaAaAa-2B/R3C-151/09 /301 Sthatha dated 07.09.2009 in pursuance of a decision of a meeting of the Building Construction Committee alleged to be held on 03.09.2009. Since the impugned Memo dated 07.09.2009 is tainted with bad faith and in violation of the principle of natural justice, it is without lawful authority and of no legal effect.<br/> <br/>The respondent nos. 1 and 4 have contested the Rule by filing two separate Affidavits-in-Opposition in Writ Petition No. 6338 of 2009. Their case, in short, is as under:<br/>The petitioner is a lessee under the RAJUK in the case plot subject to the stipulations in the deed of standard lease. After making necessary enquiries, the RAJUK granted sanction to him for constructing a multi-storied building therein by Memo No. RAJUK/ NaAaAa-2/B-R3C-151/09/339 dated 11.05.2009. But subsequently, the RAJUK authority came to know that there was security concern of foreign guests, tourists and dignitaries staying in the Westin Hotel and on the basis of cancellation of the “অবসহানগত ছাড়পত্র” given by the Environment Directorate, the RAJUK authority revoked the sanction for construction of the multi-storied building in the case plot by the impugned Memo dated 07.09.2009. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the revocation of the sanction by the impugned Memo dated 07.09.2009 is perfectly justified. So the Rule is liable to be discharged. <br/> <br/>At the outset, Mr. Abdul Baset Majumdar, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner-company in Writ Petition No. 4020 of 2009, submits that admittedly the case plot is adjacent  to the Five-Star Westin Hotel, Gulshan-2, Dhaka and since the respondent no.7 Dr. S.A. Mahmood got a plan approved  from the RAJUK for construction of a multi-storied building therein, the security and safety of foreign guests, tourists and dignitaries staying in the Westin Hotel would be at stake thereby hampering  the business of the company and the DGFI report dated 12.05.2009 rightly vindicated the security concern of the company and in this perspective, the sanction granted by the RAJUK for construction of the multi-storied building in the case plot was rightly revoked during the pendency of the Writ Petition.<br/> <br/>Mr. Abdul Baset Majumdar next submits that at the time of granting sanction for construction of the high-rise building in the case plot, the RAJUK authority could not visualize the security concern of the company and subsequently, it appreciated the same and accordingly, it revoked the sanction for constructing the multi-storied building therein and this revocation can not be regarded as without lawful authority in view of Annexure-‘E-1’ to the Writ Petition No. 4020 of 2009.<br/> <br/>Mr. M. Sayed Ahmed, another learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the Unique Hotel and Resorts Limited, submits that the Title Suit No. 6816 of 2008 of the 7<sup>th</sup> Court of the Joint-District Judge, Dhaka was filed for a declaration of the easement right of the Westin Hotel to light and air  through the case plot and that suit is admittedly pending for adjudication in the Court below and the company filed the Writ Petition No. 4020 of 2009 challenging the sanction accorded to Dr. S. A. Mahmood for construction of the high-rise building  in the case plot and as the jurisdiction of the Civil Court stands ousted by the provisions of Section 14 of the Building Construction Act, the company had no other option but to file the Writ Petition No. 4020 of 2009 and in such view of the matter,  the same is maintainable.<br/> <br/>Mr. M. Sayed Ahmed also submits that in the light of the Memo of the Ministry of Environment and Forest dated 22.04.2009 directing the Environment Directorate not to provide any “অবসহানগত ছাড়পত্র” to Dr. S. A. Mahmood for construction of the multi-storied building in the case plot, the “অবসহানগত ছাড়পত্র” dated 15.02.2009 is ineffective and invalid for all practical purposes.<br/> <br/>Mr. A. J. Mohammad Ali, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioners in Writ Petition Nos. 6242 of 2009 and 6338 of 2009, submits that the “অবসহানগত ছাড়পত্র” from the Directorate of Environment was taken on 15.02.2009 by Dr. S. A. Mahmood; but suppressing this fact, the Unique Hotel and Resorts Limited Company filed the Writ Petition No. 4020 of 2009 and obtained the Rule Nisi and stay-order on 04.06.2009 and on this count alone, the Rule issued in that Writ Petition No. 4020 of 2009 should be discharged.<br/> <br/>Mr. A. J. Mohammad Ali further submits that in consideration of all the facts and circumstances pertaining to the matter, the RAJUK accorded sanction to Dr. S. A. Mahmood on 11.05.2009 for construction of the multi-storied building in the case plot; but strangely enough, the sanction was rescinded by the impugned Memo dated 07.09.2009 in the face of the revocation of the “অবসহানগত ছাড়পত্র” by the Environment Directorate by the Memo dated 26.08.2009 without adhering to the principle of “Audi Alteram Partem” and such being the state of affairs, the impugned orders of the Environment Directorate dated 26.08.2009 and the RAJUK dated 07.09.2009 are without jurisdiction and malafide and from this standpoint, Dr. S. A. Mahmood felt legally obligated to file Writ Petition Nos. 6242 of 2009 and 6338 of 2009 under Article 102 of the Constitution.<br/> <br/>On the contrary, Mr. A.K.M. Nazrul Islam, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent-RAJUK, submits that as against the impugned order dated 07.09.2009, Dr. S. A. Mahmood ought to have preferred an appeal to the appellate authority under Section 15 of the Building Construction Act; but since he did not do so, the Writ Petition No. 6338 of 2009 is incompetent. In this connection, Mr. A. K. M. Nazrul Islam relies on the decision in the case of Shahabuddin Chisti Vs. Rajdhani Unnayan Katripakhya reported in 6 ADC 271.<br/> <br/>Mr. A.K.M. Nazrul Islam also submits that the RAJUK correctly appreciated the security concern of foreign guests, tourists and dignitaries staying in the Westin Hotel in view of the report of the DGFI (Annexure-‘E-1’ to the Writ Petition No. 4020 of 2009) and as such the RAJUK authority rightly revoked the sanction by the impugned order dated 07.09.2009.<br/> <br/>Mr. A.K.M. Nazrul Islam also submits that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the impugned order dated 07.09.2009 is perfectly justified, even though Dr. S.A. Mahmood was not given any opportunity of being heard prior to issuance of the same.<br/> <br/>Mr. A.K.M. Nazrul Islam further submits that in view of the provisions of Section 3 of the Building Construction Act and Section 21 of the General Clauses Act, the RAJUK authority has the inherent power revoke or withdraw any sanction for construction and accordingly, it revoked the sanction by the impugned order dated 07.09.2009.<br/> <br/>In a last-ditch attempt, Mr. Mr. A.K.M. Nazrul Islam submits that as per second proviso to Section 3A of the Building Construction Act, the construction of the multi-storied building in the case plot would be nothing but a nuisance to the boarders of the Westin Hotel and that being so, the RAJUK rightly rescinded the sanction by the impugned order dated 07.09.2009 and as such no exception can be taken thereto.<br/> <br/>Mr. A.F. Hassan Ariff, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent no. 7-Dr. S. A. Mahmood in Writ Petition No.4020 of 2009, submits  that the “অবসহানগত ছাড়পত্র” was given by the Environment Directorate on 15.02.2009; but stunningly enough,  the affidavit in that Writ Petition was sworn on 03.06.2009 asserting that Dr. S. A. Mahmood started construction of the multi-storied building in the case plot without having any “অবসহানগত ছাড়পত্র” from the Environment Directorate and thus by perpetration of fraud upon the Court, the Unique  Hotel and Resorts Limited obtained the Rule Nisi  and stay-order on 04.06.2009 and this conduct of the company clearly demonstrates  the malafides or bad faith on its part in filing the said Writ Petition and in this view of the matter, the Rule issued therein must fail.<br/> <br/>Mr. M. K. Rahman, the learned Additional Attorney-General appearing on behalf of the added respondent no.8-Ministry of Home Affairs in Writ Petition No. 4020 of 2009, submits that because of security concern of the diplomatic areas in general and the foreign boarders of the Westin Hotel in particular, there should not be any high-rise building in the case plot and the RAJUK authority finally appreciated the matter and revoked the sanction by the impugned order dated 07.09.2009.<br/> <br/>Mr. Korunamoy Chakma, the learned Deputy Attorney-General appearing on behalf of the respondent nos.1-4 in Writ Petition No. 6242 of 2009, submits that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the Directorate of Environment lawfully cancelled the “অবসহানগত ছাড়পত্র” by the impugned Memo dated 26.08.2009 and by that reason, it does not call for any interference.<br/> <br/>Mr. Korunamoy Chakma also submits that it is true that the impugned Memo dated 26.08.2009 cancelling the sanction of the RAJUK with reference to construction of the multi-storied building in the case plot was issued without hearing Dr. S. A. Mahmood; but in the light of the decision in the case of Abdur Rahman and others V. Sultan @ Sultan &amp; others reported in 35 DLR (AD) 51, the impugned order dated 26.08.2009 is sustainable in law.<br/> <br/>We have heard the learned Advocates Mr. Abdul Baset Majumdar, Mr. M. Sayed Ahmed, Mr. A. J. Mohammad Ali, Mr. A. F. Hassan Ariff and the Additional Attorney-General Mr. M. K. Rahman and the Deputy Attorney-General Mr. Korunamoy Chakma and perused the Writ Petitions, Affidavits-in-Opposition, Affidavit-in-Reply and relevant Annexures annexed thereto.<br/> <br/>Mr. A.K.M. Nazrul Islam, Mr. Abdul Baset Majumdar and Mr. M. Sayed Ahmed have particularly laid emphasis on the report of the DGFI dated 12.05.2009 (Annexure-‘E-1` to the Writ Petition No. 4020 of 2009) as to the security concern of the Westin Hotel and its foreign boarders. From a perusal of Annexure-‘E-1’, it appears that the DGFI was concerned with the security of the entire diplomatic zone in the vicinity of the case plot. This Annexure-‘E-1’ does not specifically and substantially refer to any security threat that may emanate from the construction of the high-rise building therein; rather the security concern expressed in Annexure-‘E-1’ seems to be vague, nebulous and unwarranted. Mere apprehension of security threat does not ipso facto hold good. The construction of the multi-storied building in the case plot can not be halted in any event. Over and above, it is the right of Dr. S. A. Mahmood to enjoy his own property in any manner he likes unless it is barred by any specific restriction imposed by law. It may be recalled that it is on record that at one point of time, the Unique Hotel and Resorts Limited made a proposal to Dr. S. A. Mahmood to purchase the case plot, but he did not consent thereto. As we see it, this phenomenon prompted the company to lodge complaints with various authorities against Dr. S. A. Mahmood’s contemplated construction of the high-rise building in the case plot resulting in eventual revocation of the অবসহানগত ছাড়পত্র issued by the Environment Directorate and the sanction given by the RAJUK behind his back. Although the “অবসহানগত ছাড়পত্র” dated 15.02.2009 was issued by the Directorate of Environment  in favour of Dr. S. A. Mahmood; but for reasons best known to itself, the company suppressed this fact in Writ Petition  No. 4020 of 2009 and obtained the Rule Nisi and stay-order on 04.06.2009. This conduct of the company, no doubt, betokens bad faith or malafides on its part in obtaining the Rule Nisi and stay-order in that Writ Petition. On this score alone, the Rule issued therein must fail.<br/> <br/>It may be recalled that the impugned order dated 26.08.2009 was issued cancelling the “অবসহানগত ছাড়পত্র” dated 15.02.2009. Besides, the impugned order dated 07.09.2009 was made rescinding the sanction for construction of the high-rise building in the case plot. It is undisputed that in both the instances, Dr. S. A. Mahmood was condemned unheard. In other words, the principle of “Audi Alteram Partem” was not adhered to prior to rescission of the “অবসহানগত ছাড়পত্র” by the Environment Directorate and the sanction by the RAJUK authority.    <br/> <br/>Mr. A.K.M. Nazrul Islam candidly concedes that Dr. S. A. Mahmood did not violate any of the terms and conditions of the sanction as provided by Section 9 of the Building Construction Act and in this view of the matter, the question of cancellation of sanction for construction of the multi-storied building in the case plot does not arise at all on that ground.<br/> <br/>The principles of natural justice are applied to administrative process to ensure procedural fairness and to free it from arbitrariness. Violation of these principles results in jurisdictional errors. Thus in a sense, violation of these principles constitutes procedural ultra vires. It is, however, impossible to give an exact connotation of these principles as its contents are flexible and variable depending on the circumstances of each case, i.e., the nature of the function of the public functionary, the rules under which he has to act and the subject-matter he has to deal with. These principles are classified into two categories-(i) a man can not be condemned unheard (audi alteram partem) and (ii) a man can not be the judge in his own cause (nemo debet esse judex in propria causa). The contents of these principles vary with the varying circumstances and those can not be petrified or fitted into rigid moulds. They are flexible and turn on the facts and circumstances of each case. In applying these principles, there is a need to balance the competing interests of administrative justice and the exigencies of efficient administration. These principles were applied originally to courts of justice and now extend to any person or body deciding issues affecting the rights or interests of individuals where a reasonable citizen would have legitimate expectation that the decision-making process would be subject to some rules of fair procedure. These rules apply, even though there may be no positive words in the statute requiring their application.<br/> <br/>Lord Atkin in R. v. Electricity Commissioners ([1924] 1 KB 171) observed that the rules of natural justice applied to ‘any body of persons having legal authority to determine questions affecting the rights of subjects, and having the duty to act judicially’. The expression ‘having the duty to act judicially’ was used in England to limit the application of the rules to decision-making bodies similar in nature to a court of law. Lord Reid, however, freed these rules from the bondage in the landmark case of Ridge v. Baldwin ([1964] AC 40). But even before this decision, the rules of natural justice were being applied in our country to administrative proceedings which might affect the person, property or other rights of the parties concerned in the dispute. In all proceedings by whomsoever held, whether judicial or administrative, the principles of natural justice have to be observed if the proceedings might result in consequences affecting the person or property or other right of the parties concerned. In this connection, reliance may be placed on the cases of The University of Dacca and another Vs. Zakir Ahmed, 16 DLR (SC) 722; Sk. Ali Ahmed Vs. The Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs and others, 40 DLR (AD)170; Habibullah Khan Vs. Shah Azharuddin Ahmed and others, 35 DLR (AD)72; Hamidul Huq Chowdhury and others Vs. Bangladesh and others, 33 DLR 381 and Farzana Haque Vs. The University of Dhaka and others, 42 DLR 262.<br/> <br/>In England, the application of the principles of natural justice have been expanded by introducing the concept of ‘fairness’. In Re Infant H(K) ([1967] 1 All E.R. 226), it was held that whether the function discharged is quasi-judicial or administrative, the authority must act fairly. It is sometimes thought that the concept of ‘acting fairly’ and ‘natural justice’ are different things, but this is wrong as Lord Scarman correctly observes that the Courts have extended the requirement of natural justice, namely,  the duty to act fairly, so that it is required of a purely administrative act (Council of Civil Service Union V. Minister for the Civil Service[1984] 3 All E.R. 935). Speaking about the concept, the ‘acting fairly’ doctrine has at least proved useful as a device for evading some of the previous confusions. The Courts now have two strings to their bow. An administrative act may be held to be subject to the requirements of natural justice either because it affects rights or interests and therefore involves a duty to act judicially, in accordance with the classic authorities and Ridge V. Baldwin; or it may simply be held that in our modern approach, it automatically involves a duty to act fairly and in accordance with natural justice. The Indian Supreme Court has adopted this principle holding “….this rule of fair play must not be jettisoned save in very exceptional circumstances where compulsive necessity so demands” (Swadeshi Cotton Mills V. India, AIR 1981 SC 818). The English Courts have further expanded the horizon of natural justice by importing the concept of ‘legitimate expectation’ and holding that from promise or from established practice, a duty to act fairly and thus to comply with natural justice may arise. Thus the concepts of ‘fairness’ and ‘legitimate expectation’ have expanded the applicability of natural justice beyond the sphere of right. To cite a few examples, not only in the case of cancellation of licence which involves denial of a right, but also in the case of first time grant of licence and renewal of licence, the principle of natural justice is attracted in a limited way in consideration of legitimate expectation. An applicant for registration as a citizen, though devoid of any legal right, is entitled to a fair hearing and an opportunity to controvert any allegation levelled against him. An alien seeking a visa has no entitlement to one, but once he has the necessary documents, he does have the type of entitlement that should now be protected by due process, and the Government should not have the power to exclude him summarily.<br/> <br/>In the case of Chingleput Bottlers V. Majestic Bottlers reported in AIR 1984 SC 1030, the Indian Supreme Court has made certain observations which create an impression that the rules of natural justice are not applicable where it is a matter of privilege and no right or legitimate expectation is involved. But the application of the rules of natural justice are no longer tied to the dichotomy of right-privilege. It has been stated in “Administrative Law” by H.W.R. Wade, 5<sup>th</sup> edition at page-465: “For the purpose of natural justice, the question which matters is not whether the claimant has some legal right, but whether the legal power is being exercised over him to his disadvantage. It is not a matter of property or of vested interests, but simply of the exercise of Governmental power in a manner which is fair …” In the American jurisdiction, the right-privilege dichotomy was used to deny due process hearing where no right was involved. But starting with Gonzalez V. Freeman (334 F. 2d 570), the Courts gradually shifted in favour of the privilege cases and in the words of Professor Schwartz, “The privilege-right dichotomy is in the process of being completely eroded” (“Administrative Law”, 1976, Page-230). Article 31 of our Constitution incorporating the concept of procedural due process, the English decisions expanding the frontiers of natural justice are fully applicable in Bangladesh.<br/> <br/>In English law, the rules of natural justice perform a function, within   a limited field, similar to the concept of procedural due process as it exists in the American jurisdiction. Following the English decisions, the Courts of this sub-continent have held that the principles of natural justice should be deemed incorporated in every statute unless it is excluded expressly or by necessary implication by any statute.<br/> <br/>The basic principle of fair procedure is that before taking any action against a man, the authority should give him notice of the case and afford him a fair opportunity to answer the case against him and to put his own case. The person sought to be affected must know the allegation and the materials to be used against him and he must be given a fair opportunity to correct or contradict them. The right to a fair hearing is now of universal application whenever a decision affecting the rights or interest of a man is made. But such a notice is not required where the action does not affect the complaining party.<br/> <br/>It is often said that mala fides or bad faith vitiates everything and a mala fide act is a nullity. What is malafides?  Relying on some observations of the Indian Supreme Court in some decisions, Durgadas Basu J held, “It is commonplace to state that mala fides does not necessarily involve a malicious intention. It is enough if the aggrieved party establishes: (i) that the authority making the impugned order did not apply its mind at all to the matter in question; or (ii) that the impugned order was made for a purpose or upon a ground other than what is mentioned in the order.” (Ram Chandra Vs. Secretary to the Government of W.B, AIR 1964 Cal 265).<br/> <br/>To render an action mala fide, “There must be existing definite evidence of bias and action which can not be attributed to be otherwise bona fide; actions not otherwise bona fide, however, by themselves would not amount to be mala fide unless the same is in accompaniment with some other factors which would depict a bad motive or intent on the part of the doer of the act” (Punjab Vs. Khanna, AIR 2001 SC 343).<br/> <br/>The principle of reasonableness is used in testing the validity of all administrative actions and an unreasonable action is taken to have never been authorized by the Legislature and is treated as ultra vires. According to Lord Greene, an action of an authority is unreasonable when it is so unreasonable that no man acting reasonably could have taken it. This has now come to be known as Wednesbury unreasonableness. (Associated Provincial Picture Vs. Wednesbury Corporation [1948]1KB 223).<br/> <br/>In Article 226 of the Indian Constitution, we do not come across the expression “if satisfied that no other equally efficacious remedy is provided by law”; but in our constitution, this expression is very much there in Article 102(2)(a). So there is a constitutional bar to the invocation of the Writ Jurisdiction of the High Court Division under Article 102(2)(a) of the Constitution, if there is any other equally efficacious remedy is provided by law.<br/> <br/>In England, prerogative writs particularly writs of mandamus were not issued by the Court when alternative remedy under the statute was available. This was a self-imposed rule of the Court on the ground of public policy. Issuance of writs when alternative remedies were not availed of would undermine the Subordinate Courts and Tribunals. Under the Pakistan Constitution of 1956, the Supreme Court and the High Courts in issuing prerogative writs used to follow the rule of the English Court. It was, however, pointed out that this rule of exhaustion of alternative remedies was the rule of the Court and did not affect the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain writ petitions. But the Pakistan Constitution of 1962 provided that the High Courts would interfere only when there was no other adequate remedy available to the petitioner. The same position has been maintained in our Constitution which stipulates non-availability of efficacious remedy as a pre-condition for interference by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/> In the case of Shafiqur Rahman v. Certificate Officer, Dhaka and another reported in 29DLR SC 232, the Supreme Court noted the change and observed in paragraph 28:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“... if the alternative remedy is adequate and equally efficacious, in that case, such an alternative remedy is a positive bar to the exercise of the writ jurisdiction, even though the writ concerned is in the nature of certiorari.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Article 102(2)(a) having incorporated the rule of exhaustion of statutory remedies, existence of efficacious remedy will preclude reliefs  thereunder. The bar of efficacious remedy is not attracted when an infringement of fundamental right is alleged.<br/> <br/>In the case of Dhaka Warehouse Ltd. and another Vs. Assistant Collector of Customs and others reported in 1991 BLD(AD) 327, it was held in paragraph 12:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“12. In principle, where an alternative statutory remedy is available, an application under Article 102 may not be entertained to circumvent a statutory procedure. There are, however, exceptions to the rule. Without attempting an exhaustive enumeration of all possible extraordinary situations, we may note a few of them. In spite of an alternative statutory remedy, an aggrieved person may take recourse to Article 102 of the Constitution where the vires of a statute or a statutory provision is challenged; where the alternative remedy is not efficacious or adequate; and, where the wrong complained of is so inextricably mixed up that the High Court Division may, for the prevention of public injury and the vindication of public justice, examine that complaint. It is needless to add that the High Court Division is to see that the aggrieved person must have good reason for by-passing an alternative remedy.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>If the impugned action is wholly without jurisdiction in the sense of not being authorized by the statute or is in violation of a constitutional provision, a Writ Petition will be maintainable without exhaustion of the statutory remedy. Besides, on the ground of malafides, the petitioner may come up with a Writ Petition by-passing the statutory alternative remedy.  It is well-settled that malafides goes to the root of jurisdiction and if the impugned action is malafide, the alternative remedy provided by the statute need not be availed of. Another exception has been made in the case of M.A. Hai and others Vs. Trading Corporation of Bangladesh reported in 40 DLR (AD) 206 where the Appellate Division has held in paragraph 10 that availability of alternative remedy by way of appeal or revision will not stand in the way of invoking the writ jurisdiction of the High Court Division raising purely a question of law or interpretation of statute.<br/> <br/>Coming back to the present case, it is an admitted fact that Dr. S. A. Mahmood  did not resort to the appellate authority as contemplated  by Section 15  of the Building Construction Act against the impugned order dated 07.09.2009 cancelling the sanction for construction of the high-rise building in the case plot. It is further admitted that he did not prefer any appeal under Section 14 of the পরিবেশ সংরক্ষণ আইন, ১৯৯৫ against the impugned order dated 26.08.2009 rescinding the “অবসহানগত ছাড়পত্র” dated 15.02.2009.<br/> <br/>It goes without saying that in view of the Ministry of Environment and Forest’s Memo dated 22.01.2009, the Directorate of Environment issued the “অবসহানগত ছাড়পত্র” dated 15.02.2009 with reference to the construction of the multi-storied building in the case plot. So we are not impressed by the contention of Mr. M. Sayed Ahmed that the “অবসহানগত ছাড়পত্র” dated 15.02.2009 is ineffective and invalid for all practical purposes in the light of the Memo of the said Ministry dated 22.04.2009.<br/> <br/>Section 3 of the Building Construction Act deals with restriction as regards construction of any building or excavation of any tank without the previous sanction of an Authorized Officer or a Building Construction Committee, as the case may be. That sanction was granted for construction of a high-rise building in the case plot by the Memo dated 11.05.2009. Section 21 of the General Clauses Act provides for the applicability of the principle of “locus penitentiae”. As per that principle, the authority competent to make an order has the power to undo the same; but the order can not be withdrawn or rescinded once it has taken legal effect and certain rights are created in favour of any individual (Ziauddin Vs. Pakistan Defence Housing Authority, 1999 PLC 723). It appears that pursuant to the said Memo dated 11.05.2009, Dr. S. A. Mahmood demolished the pre-existing two-storied residential building and started constructing the high-rise building in the case plot. In fact, the Memo dated 11.05.2009 was acted upon before issuance of the impugned Memo dated 07.09.2009. So we hold that Mr. A. K. M. Nazrul Islam has erroneously invoked Section 21 of the General Clauses Act.<br/> <br/>As indicated earlier, the report of the DGFI (Annexure-‘E-1’ to Writ Petition No. 4020 of 2009) relates to the security concern of the diplomatic zone of Dhaka Metropolitan City. We fail to understand as to why it was perceived by the RAJUK and the Environment Directorate that the contemplated high-rise building in the case plot would pose a security threat to the Westin Hotel and its boarders especially when there are several existing high-rise buildings in its vicinity.<br/> <br/>Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, it seems to us that the impugned Memo dated 26.08.2009 cancelling the “অবসহানগত ছাড়পত্র” dated 15.02.2009 was issued in colourable exercise of power and for collateral purpose. It is very strange that the RAJUK issued the impugned Memo dated 07.09.2009 cancelling the sanction for construction of the high-rise building in the case plot in a very mechanical, thoughtless, slipshod and cavalier manner. A reference to the impugned Memo dated 07.09.2009 positively indicates that the RAJUK just followed suit in the matter of revocation of sanction. It is an indisputable fact that Dr. S. A. Mahmood was not afforded any opportunity of being heard prior to issuance of the impugned Memos dated 26.08.2009 and 07.09.2009. These two impugned Memos amply demonstrate that both the Environment Directorate and the RAJUK did not apply their mind to the matter. In other words, it was a case of total non-application of mind on the part of the RAJUK and the Environment of Directorate. They signally skirted around their duty to act fairly and reasonably. Neither the Building Construction Act, 1952 nor the পরিবেশ সংরক্ষণ আইন, ১৯৯৫ expressly or impliedly excludes the operation of the principle of “Audi Alteram Partem”. As Dr. S. A. Mahmood’s right to enjoyment of the case plot was adversely affected by the impugned Memos of the Environment Directorate and the RAJUK; in all fairness and reasonableness, he ought not to have been condemned unheard. To all intents and purposes, in our assessment, the Environment Directorate and the RAJUK’S impugned Memos dated 26.08.2009 and 07.09.2009 respectively are unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense. As the said Memos dated 26.08.2009 and 07.09.2009 are malafide and without jurisdiction, Dr. S.A. Mahmood was not required to approach the Appellate Authority  either under Section 14  of the পরিবেশ সংরক্ষণ আইন, ১৯৯৫  or under Section 15 of the Building Construction Act, 1952 and he rightly approached the High Court Division directly under Article 102 of the Constitution.<br/> <br/>We do not find any material on record to hold that Dr. S. A. Mahmood infringed any of the provisions of Rule 45 of the ঢাকা মহানগর ইমারত নির্মাণ বিধিমালা, ২০০৬. Undeniably, he did not violate any of the provisions of Section 9 of the Building Construction Act, 1952. According to the submission of Mr. A.K.M. Nazrul Islam, the construction of the high-rise building in the case plot would be a nuisance to the Hotel Westin and its neighbourhood as postulated by second proviso to Section 3A of the Building Construction Act. But no material is forthcoming on record to justify this submission of Mr. A.K.M. Nazrul Islam.<br/> <br/>As to the reliance of Mr. A.K.M. Nazrul Islam on the decision in the case of Shahabuddin Chisti Vs. Rajdhani Unnayan Katripakhya and another reported in 6 ADC 271, we find that the facts and circumstances of that case are quite distinguishable from those of the instant case.  Secondly, in that case, the filing of a suit was found to be not maintainable as the Building Construction Act provides for a special remedy by way of appeal. No suit having been instituted by Dr. S. A. Mahmood, his two Writ Petitions, namely, Writ Petition Nos. 6242 of 2009 and 6338 of 2009 have already been found maintainable by us. In such a posture of things, the reference to that decision does not appear to be of any avail to Mr. A.K. M. Nazrul Islam.<br/> <br/>With regard to the reference to the decision in the case of Abdur Rahman and others Vs. Sultan @ Sultan &amp; others reported in 35DLR(AD)51 made by the learned Deputy Attorney-General Mr. Korunamoy Chakma, we opine that the said decision, in the facts and circumstances of the case in hand, has no manner of application. So the reference to the above decision by Mr. Korunamoy Chakma does not help him in any way.<br/> <br/>Mr. Abdul Baset Majumdar relies on the decision in the case of V.M. Kurian Vs. State of Kerala and others reported in AIR 2001 Supreme Court 1409 in support of his argument that for public safety, both the Environment Directorate and the RAJUK rightly issued the impugned Memos dated 26.08.2009 and 07.09.2009 respectively. The facts and circumstances of that case are ex-facie distinguishable from those of the present case. So we do not find any relevance and applicability of that decision to the facts and circumstances of this case.<br/> <br/>Admittedly, the Unique Hotel and Resorts Limited Company filed Title Suit No. 6816 of 2008 in the 7<sup>th</sup> Court of Joint-District Judge, Dhaka for a declaration of easement right to light and air through the case plot. It is also undisputed that the suit is still pending for adjudication. Although the reliefs sought for in Writ Petition No. 4020 of 2009 and those sought for in Title Suit No. 6816 of 2008 are not one and the same, but nevertheless the company does not seem to be interested in getting the said suit disposed of on merit with utmost expedition for inexplicable and unfatho-mable reasons. <br/> <br/>Having regard to the facts and circumst-ances of the case and in view of the foregoing discussions, it transpires to us that as a pressure strategy, the company has filed the Writ Petition No. 4020 of 2009 against Dr. S. A. Mahmood in particular in order to compel him to yield to its undue pressure so that at one point of time, he may agree to sell the case plot thereto.<br/> <br/>Having considered all the aspects of the case, we are of the considered view that there is no merit in the Rule issued in Writ Petition No. 4020 of 2009 and we do find merit in the Rules issued in Writ Petition Nos. 6242 of 2009 and 6338 of 2009.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the Rule issued in Writ Petition No. 4020 of 2009 is discharged without any order as to costs. Consequentially and necessarily, the Rules issued in Writ Petition Nos. 6242 of 2009 and 6338 of 2009 are made absolute without any order as to costs. It is declared that the impugned Memo No. Paribesh/Dhabi/18628/Proshason-1737 dated 26.08.2009 (Annexure-‘B’) issued by the respondent no. 4 in Writ Petition No. 6242 of 2009 cancelling the “অবসহানগত ছাড়পত্র” dated 15.02.2009 is declared to be without lawful authority and of no legal effect. It is further declared that the impugned Memo No. RAJUK/NaAaAa-2B/R3C-151/09/301 Sthatha dated 07.09.2009 (Annexure-‘C’) issued by the respondent no. 2 in Writ Petition No. 6338 of 2009 revoking the sanction for construction of the high-rise building in the case plot as was given by Memo No. RAJUK/NaAaAa-2/B-R3C-151/09/339 dated 11.05.2009 (Annexure-‘A’) is without lawful authority and of no legal effect.<br/> <br/>Let a copy of this judgment be transmitted immediately to the concerned respondents each.<br/> <br/>Ed.</div></div></div>
