S. from Zemindary Sheresta on payment of taka 100/- as Salami and since then possessed the suit land by erecting homestead and digging pond therein; After his expiry, plaintiff has been living therein with his family; Plaintiff’s father paid rent to the Zemindary Sheresta and subsequently paid rents to the Government exchequer; Plaintiff’s father possessed the suit land uninterruptedly for more than 12 years and thus acquired a valid title by way of adverse possession; though the defendants have no manner of title and possession but the suit land wrongly recorded as khas land in the R.S. Khatian; Plaintiff came to know about the wrong recording on 12.09.1999 from Tahsil 0ffice and constrained to file this suit.<br/><br/>Defendant no.2 contested the suit by filing a written statement contending interalia that the suit is barred by the principles of waiver, estoppel and acquiscence; not maintainable in its present form. Case of the defendant is that after abolition of Zemindari system, suit land has been vested to the government by operation of law and since then government has been possessing the suit land; R. S. khatian rightly prepared in the name of Government.<br/>After hearing the parties, learned Assistant Judge dismissed the suit by his judgment and decree dated 09.03.2000 and 20.03.2000 respectively. <br/><br/>Being aggrieved, the plaintiff as appellant preferred Title Appeal no.76 of 2000 in the Court of learned District Judge, Mymensingh, which was ultimately heard and disposed of by the learned Joint District Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Mymensingh, who after hearing the parties and perusing the record has been pleased to allow the appeal vide judgment and decree dated 29.11.2001 and 05.01.2002 respectively by setting aside the judgment and decree passed by the learned Assistant Judge.<br/><br/>Having aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and decree, the defendant-respondents as petitioners preferred this application under Section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained the present rule.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Khalilur Rahman, learned Assistant Attorney General, appearing for the petitioners submits that the trial court after assessing the evidence on record arrived at a finding that the ‘Hukumnama’ dated 7<sup>th</sup> Jaishta 1944 B. S. is forged one and created only to grab the suit land, though appellate Court below affirmed the finding but erroneously allowed the appeal on a finding that the plaintiff-opposite party has been possessing the suit land since his predecessor for more than 60 years and thus acquired title by way of adverse possession without considering the legal aspect that a person is not entitled to declaration of title through adverse possession when claiming title through rayoti settlement. In support of his submission, learned advocate referred to the case of Salma Khatun and others -Vs- Zilla Parishad, Chittagong, represented by its Secretary and another, reported in 51 DLR (AD) 257.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Mr. Mahmudul Islam with Mr. Manzur Al Matin, learned advocates appearing for the opposite party submits that both the courts below arrived at a findings that the plaintiff is in possession of the suit land but the trial court arrived at a finding that possession of the plaintiff is not legal because the plaintiff claiming title in the suit land by a forged document without considering that the plaintiff clearly stated in paragraph no.2 of the plaint that his father possessed the suit land uninterruptedly for more than 12 years by erecting houses and digging pond therein and after expiry of his father the plaintiff has been living therein with his family. He also submits that when a person made statement of a fact in the plaint, he is entitled to rely upon that fact in support of the relief which he claims and as such the appellate court below rightly passed the impugned judgment and decree holding that the plaintiff acquired title through adverse possession. He next submits that the plaintiff made statement of adverse possession in the plaint and also proved the same by adducing oral and documentary evidence that his father possessed the suit land uninterruptedly for more than 12 years and thereafter he has been living therein with his family. He further submits that the plaintiff claiming title through settlement and also through adverse possession, both the prayers are not inconsistent with each other, there is no bar to a person relying upon more than one alternative source of title. In support of his submissions, learned advocate referred to the case of Budhu and others-Vs- Ghulam Shah, reported in 15 DLR (SC) 315, the case of Mahaprabhu Ram-Vs- Gopal Ram Ram &amp; others, reported in 42 DLR (AD) 154; the case of Gouri Das and others- Vs- ABM Hasan Kabir and others, reported in 55 DLR (AD) 52 and an unreported judgment dated 13.11.2014 passed by our apex Court in the case of Mosharaf Hossain Chowdhury (Kanchan) -Vs- Habibur Rahman and others, in Civil Appeal No.213 of 2007.  <br/>Heard the learned advocates. Perused the lower Court’s record and decisions cited by the learned Advocates.<br/><br/>On perusal of the plaint it appears that the plaintiff claiming title in the suit land through settlement from Zemindary Sheresta in favour of his father vide hukumnama dated 7<sup>th</sup> Jaishta 1344 B.S. and also claiming title through adverse possession stating in the plaint that his father possessed the suit land by erecting houses and digging ponds therein uninterruptedly for more than 12 years and thereafter plaintiff has been living therein with his family. The trial court though found that the plaintiff is in possession of the suit land but held that the possession is illegal inasmuch as exhibit-2 i.e. ‘hukumnama’ dated 7<sup>th</sup> Jaishta, 1344 B. S. is a forged one. Learned Assistant Judge also arrived at a finding that the plaintiff when claiming title in the suit land through settlement he cannot set up a claim of adverse possession. The appellate court below after reassessing the evidence on record arrived at a finding that the trial court rightly found that the exhibit ‘2’ filed by the plaintiff in support of his claim in the suit land is forged one but did not consider the legal aspect that plaintiff is in possession of the suit land from the period of his predecessor for more than 60 years and as such acquired a valid title in the suit land by way of adverse possession.<br/><br/>It appears that the plaintiff adduced five witnesses in support of his claim and all of them stated that the plaintiff has been possessing the suit land uninterruptedly from the period of his father.<br/><br/>In the case of Budhu and others-Vs-Ghulam Shah, reported in 15 DLR (SC) 315, their lordships held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“ When a person makes a statement of a fact in the plaint he is entitled to rely upon that fact in support of the relief which he claims and it is not necessary for him to say in the plaint in so many words that he relies upon it.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Their lordships also held:<br/><em>“There is no bar to a person relying upon more than one alternative source of title. An alternative case should be distinguished from an inconsistent case. No two facts can be said to be inconsistent with each other if both could happened.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the unreported judgment dated 13.11.2014 passed in Civil Appeal No.213 of 2007, our apex court held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“In paragraph -3 of the plaint, the plaintiffs stated in no uncertain terms that their predecessor, Safar Ali Majumder had been in possession of the suit property for more than 12 years and as such, he had also acquired title to the suit property on the basis of adverse possession.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It also appears that though defendant no.2 contested the suit by filing written statement but did not examine himself or any witness to support his contention, even did not file any documents/papers. Their only contention as stated in the written statement that after abolition of the Zemindary system the suit land vested with the Government by operation of law but no where it is stated that how or through whom Government possessing the suit land.<br/>Both the Courts’ below found that the plaintiff has been possessing the suit land. A person in possession of land has a good title against the whole world except the person with title. <br/><br/>Under the facts and circumstances of the case and for the reasons stated hereinabove, I do not find any reason to interfere with the finding of the appellate court below that the plaintiff has acquired a valid title in the suit land through adverse possession.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the rule is discharged.<br/><br/>Impugned judgment and decree dated 29.11.2001 passed by the Joint District Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Mymensingh, in Title Appeal No.76 of 2000 allowing the appeal, is hereby maintained.<br/><br/>Send down the lower court records alongwith a copy of this judgment to the court concern at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div><div><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"> </div></div></div></div>

Golam Azam Talukder, father of the writ-petitioner, was the owner of 10 annas share in the tank in question covering an area of .7925 acres of land appertaining to D.S. Khatian No.2, Dag No.3164 corresponding to S.A. Khatian No.15, Dag No.1111 covering an area of .47 acre of land. The said tank was originally recorded in the names of Zaminder Hemchandra Chowdhury and others along with other lands in C.S. Khatian No.2, who made pattan of 10(ten) annas shares in favour of the father of the writ-petitioner admitting him as their tenant and granted 16 (sixteen) dakhilas in his favour on receipt of rents from him. Pursuant to pattan, the S.A. Khatian was prepared in the name of said Md. Golam Azam Talukder. Subsequently, it was transferred to the writ-petitioner, vide registered deed of heba-bil-ewaz dated 16.10.1961. While the father of the writ-petitioner was in peaceful possession of the same, the Government vide gazette notification dated 30.03.1961 assumed the right of possession, management and control of the ‘un-acquired’ shares of the said tank under section 2(1) of the Sairat Mahals (Management) Ordinance,1959 (in short, the Ordinance) to the extent of 14 annas, 1 ganda, 3 kora, 1 karat and 11 till out of .7975 acre of land. Since the father of the writ-petitioner did not receive any compensation from the government under sub-section (3) of section 2 of the said Ordinance he made several representations to the authority concerned to that effect, but to no avail. On 08.12.1986, he made another representation stating that the said tank had been filled up with earth and consequent thereto the Government was not rearing any fish for the last 14/15 years. Earth of the said tank was being sold in the month of Chaitra and that unlawful occupants had created shops on the bank of the said tank and hence, prayed to the Deputy Commissioner, Sirajgonj to relinquish its rights of possession, management and control of the said tank in his favour under section 4 of the Ordinance. The Deputy Commissioner, Sirajgonj, accordingly, sent the matter on 09.12.1986 to the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) for disposal. Pursuant thereto Miscellaneous Case No.148 of 1986 was registered. The father of the writ-petitioner was heard on 23.12.1986 and was directed to give written reply on 24.12.1986. The Government pleader was asked to give opinion in the matter. Later upon giving written opinion on 29.12.1986, the Government pleader opined to return the 10 annas share of the said tank to the father of the writ-petitioner and to pay him compensation as per law. The Revenue Deputy Collector, Sirajgonj, considering the said opinion took up Miscellaneous Case No. 148 of 1986 on 20.12.1986 and upon hearing the father of the writ-petitioner disposed of the application observing that the disputed tank might be returned to him on ascertaining the area by surveyor under section 4 of the Ordinance or compensation might be assessed for his share and be paid to him, but no steps were taken by the Government to the effect. Subsequently, the father of the writ-petitioner by filing an application on 22.06.1987 brought it to the notice of the Minister, vide memo dated 30.10.1990 who referred the said Miscellaneous Case to the Secretary, Ministry of Land for approval of the judgment and order dated 30.12.1986 and for publication in gazette notification under section 4 of the Ordinance but to no avail. At this stage, the father of the writ-petitioner died on 15.10.1991 and after his death, the writ-petitioner being the owner of the said tank by virtue of the said Hiba-bil-ewaz requested the authority and the Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Sirajgonj, vide memo dated 27.02.1997 gave reminder to the Secretary, Ministry of Land to take steps to the effect, but the authority kept silent. The cause of action arose when writ-respondent No.1 through the Senior Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Land informed the writ-petitioner on 15.03.1998 that the said tank of S.A. Dag No.1111 had been recorded in khas khatian No.1 in Dag No.1516 and as such, the same could not be relinquished in favour of the writ-petitioner. The writ-petitioner made further request to the authority concerned to consider the matter, but in vain.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the gazette notification dated 30.03.1961 so far as it relates to the writ-petitioner’s property (Annexure-B) and for direction upon the writ-respondents to relinquish right of possession, management and control to him, writ-petitioner Sultana Islam filed writ-petition before the High Court Division and obtained Rule Nisi in Writ Petition No.4686 of 2002.<br/><br/>Writ-respondent No.2 contested the Rule by filing affidavit-in-opposition controverting the material statements made in the writ-petition. His case, in short, is that the tank in question was recorded in the name of Zaminder in C.S. Khatian No.2 in Plot No.3164 with an area of .7925 acre of land with the remark that it was being used by the public. After the abolition of Zamindery system, the said C.S. plot along with other khas lands vested in the Government free from all encumbrances. During S.A. operation, C.S. Plot No.3164 was changed into S.A. Plot No.1111 and was recorded in ‘Chhut khatian’ in the name of the Government. The father of the writ-petitioner allegedly in collusion with others managed to have it recorded in S.A. Khatian Nos.13 and 15. When it came to the notice of the government, it assumed the right of possession, management and control of the tank, vide gazette notification dated 30.06.1961. Later the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Pabna recorded the disputed S.A. Plot No.1111 having an area of .7527 acre, vide memo dated 05.04.1980 as ‘sairat mahal’ and transferred to Sairat Mahals Register (Reg. Novi) and hence it was recorded in khas khatian No.1. During R.S. operation, the said S.A. Plot No.1111 was changed to R.S. Plot No.1516 and was recorded in the name of writ-respondent No.2 and as such, the Rule Nisi issued in the above writ-petition is liable to be discharged.<br/><br/>The learned Judges of the High Court Division upon hearing the parties by the judgment and order dated 26.08.2008 made absolute with direction.<br/><br/>Feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division, the writ-respondent as the leave-petitioner moved this Division by filing Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.989 of 2009, in which, leave was granted on 15.12.2009, resulting in Civil Appeal No.165 of 2010.<br/>Mr. Ekramul Haque, the learned Deputy Attorney  General, appearing on behalf of the appellant, submits that by the gazette notification dated 30.03.1961 (Annexure-B to the writ-petition) the Government assumed the right, of possession, management and control of the un-acquired shares of the said tank and as such, there cannot be any ground for challenging the said gazette notification by way of filing a writ-petition and that the High Court Division erroneously found that the gazette notification so far as it relates to share of the Late Golam Azam Talukder was not valid and as such, the impugned judgment should be set aside. He further submits that the tank in question was recorded in the name of the Zaminder Hemchandra Chowdhury in C. S. Khatian No.2 in Plot NO.3164 with an area of .7925 acre of land with the remark column that it was being used by the public and that after abolition of Zamindery system, the said C.S. plot along with other khash land vested in the Government and that the High Court Division without considering this aspect of the case made the Rule absolute and as such, the impugned judgment should be set aside.<br/><br/>Mr. Abdul Quiyum, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the respondents, on the other hand, supports the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court Division.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Deputy Attorney General and the learned Senior Advocate,   perused the impugned judgment and the materials on record.<br/><br/>Before entering into the merit of the appeal, it is necessary to go through the grounds, on which, leave was granted. The grounds are quoted below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The order passed by the Revenue Deputy Collector, Sirajgonj in Miscellaneous Case No.148 of 1996 was a mere recommendation to the Deputy Commissioner, Sirajgonj for his consideration but the Deputy Commissioner, Sirajgonj was the proper authority to pass such kind of order in Miscellaneous Case and that the tank in question was recorded in the name of Zaminder in C. S. Khatian No.2, being Plot No.3164 with an area of .7925 acre of land with the remark that it was being used by the public and after the abolition of Zamindery system, said C. S. plot along with other khas land vested in the Government free from all encumbrances and during the S.A. operation, C. S. Plot No.3164 was changed into S.A. Plot No.1111 and was recorded in the ‘Chhut khatian’ in the name of the Government.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>The High Court Division has failed to appreciate that in this case, the complicated question of title is involved and the disputes can only be determined and decided by a regular suit in a competent civil Court on taking evidence both oral and documentary and as such, the writ jurisdiction is not the proper forum for the relief sought by the writ-petitioner-respondent and in that view of the matter, the impugned judgment and order is liable to be set aside.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Admittedly, an area of .7924 acre of land of C.S. Khatian No.2, C.S. Plot No.3164 corresponding to S. A. Khatian No.15, Plot No.1111 covering an area of .47 acre of Mouza-Bhuterdiar, Police Station-Sirajgonj, District-Serajgonj originally belonged to Zaminder Hemchandra Chowdhury and others. Respondent No.1 claimed that the Zaminder settled 10 annas share of the tank in favour of his late father, Golam Azam Talukder. Pursuant thereto during S.A. operation, the name of the father of respondent No.1 was recorded in S. A. Khatian No.1315 (Annexures-Q and R respectively to the writ-petition).Subsequently, the Government admitting the father of respondent as its owner and possessor vide gazette notification dated 30.03.1961 assumed the right of possession, management and control of the un-acquired share of the tank. The relevant portion of the gazette notification reveals that the Government has assumed the right of possession, management and control of the un-acquired share of the said tank under section 2(1) of the Ordinance runs as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“2(1). Where any share of any hat, bazar, fishery or ferry has vested in the Government as a result of acquisition under the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act,1950, or otherwise, the Government may, by notification in the official gazette, assume the right of possession, management and control of the remaining share or shares of such hat, bazar, fishery or ferry.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Having gone through the above sub-section, we find that when the share of any hat, bazar, fishery or ferry has vested in the Government as a result of acquisition under the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act or otherwise, the Government is authorized to assume the right of possession, management and control of the remaining share of such fishery.<br/><br/>It is pertinent to quote sub-section (3) of section 2 of the Ordinance, which runs as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“2(3). Where the right of possession, management and control of any share in any hat, bazar, fishery or ferry has passed on to the Government under sub-section(2), the owner of such share shall, from the date of such passing on till the date of vesting of such share in the Government as a result of acquisition under the provisions of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act,1950, or otherwise, receive from the Government in respect of such share as compensation for use and occupation for each year or part of a year an amount which will bear such proportion to the net income realised by the Government for the entire property for that year or part of a year as such share bears to the whole property.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>According to the above provision of law, the owner of such share is entitled to receive compensation from the date of passing on till the date of vesting such share in the Government for use and occupation by the Government for each year or part of the year.<br/><br/>In the case in hand, the Government assumed the right of possession, management and control of the unacquired share of the tank in question under section 2 (1) of the Ordinance from the father of respondent No.1 and one M.A. Ishaque MukteÊar, Sirajgonj to the extent of 14 annas, 1 gonda, 3 karas, 1 kranti and 11 tils shares.<br/><br/>The gazette notification dated 11.03.1961 vesting the right of possession, management and control of the tank from the father of respondent No.1 has not been challenged before any Court till filing of this writ-petition before the High Court Division. The High Court Division came to a finding that the disputed tank could not be regarded as fishery and as such, assumption of the right of possession, management and control of the disputed tank by the Government was not permissible. The Government has taken over the right of possession, management and control of the disputed tank in 1961 and after lapse of many decades, it cannot be said that the disputed tank could be designated as a fishery.<br/><br/>The learned Senior Advocate for respondent No.1 submits that respondent No.1 is legally entitled to compensation from the Government. If respondent No.1 makes any prayer for compensation on account of the disputed tank, the Government will consider such prayer in accordance with law because the admitted owner is entitled to compensation.<br/><br/>In the light of the findings, we find substance in this appeal.

In the instant case, we hold that the application as has been filed by the respondent no. 5 should not be treated as an application under rule 42A  of the Rules of 1955 rather it should be considered as an application under rule 42 thereof. On a perusal of the letter as produced by the learned D.A.G. before this Court, it appears that in fact no final record-of-rights has been prepared under Khatian No. 1645 in the name of the petitioners having regard to the provisions of rules 32, 33 and 34 of the Rules of 1955. It cannot, therefore, be said that the record-of-rights had been finally published in the name of the petitioners as contended by the learned Advocate for the petitioners. Moreover, the record-of-right neither creates nor destroys title. It is merely a record of physical possession at the time when it is prepared. The Settlement Officer appointed with the additional designation of Assistant Settlement Officer may at any time before final publication of the record-of-rights exercise his jurisdiction under rule 42 of the Rules of 1955. Having regard to the aforesaid observations and decisions, we find no merit in this Rule. The Revenue Officer appointed with the additional designation of Settlement Officer may take a decision afresh about the disputed publication of the concerned record-of-rights in view of the provisions of rule 42 of the Rules of 1955. . . .

Since the record of the aforesaid Rule could not be placed before this Bench at the time of hearing, the Rule issued in the said writ petition will be heard and disposed of subsequently by a separate judgment, if the same has not been disposed of in the meantime.<br/> <br/>It is stated in the writ petition that 84.09 acres of land under C.S. Plot No. 565 appertaining to C.S. Khatian No. 107 of Mouza Keranigonj at present Tejgaon Industrial Area originally belonged to the respondent no. 5, Bhawal Raj Court of Wards Estate in 16 annas  permanent Zamindary rights and accordingly C.S. Khatian was prepared in the name of Bhawal Raj Court of Wards Estate. The petitioners became the owners of 59.36 acres of land out of 84.90 acres by way of settlement from Bhawal Raj Court of Wards Estate  in the year 1941 to 1943 corresponding to 1348 B.S. to 1351 B.S. with the permission of the Board of Revenue vide office Memo Nos. 21 of 1347 B.S. and 15 of 1349 B.S. through 6(six) separate Settlement Cases being No. 48(M) of 1349 B.S., S.Case No. 49/T of 1350 B.S., L.S. Case No. 270(M) of 1350 B.S., L.S. Case No. 117/50(M) of 1349 B.S., S.Case No. 215(5)M of 1349 B.S. and  L.S. Case No. 37(M) of 1350, Annexure-B, B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4 and  B-5.<br/><br/>After taking the aforesaid settlement the petitioners had been paying rent to the Bhawal Raj Court of Wards Estate and got rent receipt from the Estate accordingly, Annexure-C series. Since the petitioners sold some portion of the land out of 59.36 acres, the S.A. record was correctly prepared in the names of the petitioners in respect of the land under S.A. Khatian Nos. 508, 511, 512, 554, 648, 655, 663, 666, 675, 695, 703, 680, Annexure-D series. Thereafter, after the acquisition of the land of the Zaminders on cessation of the Zamindery system the rent receiving interest of the Mouza was acquired by the Government under section 3 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 (hereinafter referred to as “the S.A.T. Act”) Accordingly, the petitioners paid rent to the Government up to 1997, Annexure-E series. It has also been stated that the petitioners have been possessing and enjoying 41.24 acres of land through different tenants. During the recent Mahanagar Survey Operation the  draft record-of-rights (Tasdik Stage) was prepared in the name of the petitioners in accordance with rule 29 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Rules, 1955 (hereinafter referred as “the Rules, 1955”), Annexure- F series. The respondent no. 5, Bhawal Raj Court of Wards Estate filed 4 objection cases being nos. 263 to 266 all of 2000 under rule 30 of the Rules, 1955 for removing the name of the petitioners as appeared against the respective possession in their respective case lands in the draft record-of-rights challenging their tenancy; the Revenue Officer after hearing the parties rejected the objection cases of the respondent no. 5, vide order dated 17.1.2002 Annexure-G.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by the aforesaid rejection order, the respondent no. 5 preferred four appeals being nos. 62948 to 62951 all of 2002 under rule 31 of the Rules, 1955 before the appellate authority who after hearing the parties rejected the appeals vide judgment and order dated 10.02.2002, Annexure-H. According to the petitioners after delivery of the judgment of the appellate authority, the draft record-of-rights was finally published in the name of the petitioners under section 144(7) of the S.A.T Act read with rules 32 and 33 of the Rules, 1955, Annexure-K to the supplementary affidavit dated 8.4.2015. The respondent no.5, Bhawal Raj Court of Wards Estate made an application mentioning rule 42A of the Rules, 1955 before the Settlement Officer at Dhaka against the aforesaid appellate order for cancellation of the same and for hearing of the appeals as contained in Annexure-1 to the affidavit-in-opposition filed by the respondent no.5. Accordingly, the revenue authority on 10.4.2003 issued four notices under the signature of the respondent no. 4, Charge Officer and Assistant Settlement Officer (Appellate Officer-in-Charge) upon the petitioners for hearing of the aforesaid appeals afresh, fixing the date for hearing on 24.4.2003.<br/> <br/>This Writ Petition is directed challenging the legality and propriety of the notices of hearing of the appeal cases as issued by the respondent no. 4. At the time of issuance of the Rule this Court vide order dated 20.07.2003 stayed further proceedings of the appeal cases no. 62948 to 62951 all of 2002 then pending before the respondent no. 4 till disposal of the Rule.<br/> <br/>This Rule is contested by the respondent no. 2, Director Land Records and Survey  and respondent no. 5, Bhawal Raj Court of Wards Estate, represented by its Manager through Mr. Sashanka Shekhar Sarker, learned Deputy Attorney General and Mr. Manzill Murshid, learned Advocate respectively who also filed two separate affidavits-in-opposition.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Khairul Alam, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioners upon placing the relevant provisions of the rules incorporated  under Chapter VII of the  Rules, 1955  submits that the  Appellate Officer has not been given any power whatsoever to re-hear the appeal cases under rule 31 of the Rules, 1955 which had earlier been disposed of on final adjudication pursuant to which City Survey Khatian had been prepared and finally published under section 144(7) of the S.A.T. Act  read with rules 32 and 33 of the  Rules, 1955, in the names of the petitioners, and as such the impugned notices as issued by the respondent no. 4 Appellate Authority without setting aside the earlier order dated 10.02.2002 was absolutely without jurisdiction. He further argues that pertinency of rule 42 of the   Rules, 1955 is limited to a period prior to publication of the final record-of-rights under section 144(7) of the Act. He submits that on the face of the final publication of the record-of-rights in the name of the petitioners, the respondent no. 4 had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal cases except for a challenge of the said decision under section 145A of the Act before the Land Survey Tribunal constituted under S.A.T. Act and as such the respondent no. 5 could not invoke jurisdiction even under rule 42A of the Rules, 1955 for rehearing the decision of the Appellate Authority, afresh. In support of his submissions Mr. Alam, cited the decision in the case of <em>Bhawal Raj Court of Wards Estate represented by its Manager vs. Rashida Begum and others</em> reported in 14 MLR(AD) 2009 and <em>Md. Aftab Ali Sheikh vs. Director of Land Records and Survey and others </em>reported in 58 DLR 397.<br/> <br/>On the other hand, Mr. Sashanka Shekhar Sarker, learned Deputy Attorney General appearing on behalf of the respondent no. 2,  drawing our attention to Annexure-2,  a letter issued under Memo No. 31.03.2692 022.44.001 14-217 dated 27.5.2015 by the Zonal Settlement Officer, Dhaka, submits that the record-of-rights has not yet been finally published and notified in the official Gazette in the names of the petitioners  in respect of Khatian No. 1645 in view of the provisions  of rules, 32, 33 and 34 of the Rules, 1955 and as such the Revenue Officer with the additional designation of Settlement Officer can invoke the jurisdiction to initiate a proceeding afresh from such stage as he may direct under rule 42 of the Rules, 1955.<br/> <br/>Mr. Manzill Murshid, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent no. 5, Bhawal Raj Court of Wards Estate adopted the submissions of the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing on behalf of the respondent no.2.<br/> <br/>We have perused the petition and the  annexures thereto, the impugned notices and the relevant provisions of law and considered the submissions of the learned Advocates for the respective parties.<br/> <br/>The question which requires to be determined is whether the respondent no. 4, Charge Officer, Dhaka Settlement is empowered under the provisions of Rules, 1955 to adjudicate the appeal cases which had earlier been heard and disposed of under the provisions of rule 31. It appears that the petitioners got settlement of the land in question from the C.S. recorded tenant i.e. Bhawal Raj Court of Wards Estate under six Settlement cases. Initially they paid rent to the Estate and after enactment of the S.A.T. Act when Zamindery system was abolished and the rent receiving interest vested in the Government under section 3 of the S.A.T. Act  vide publication of notification no. 2773 L.R. dated 26.2.1952 and the said notification being published in the Dhaka Gazette on 24.3.1952 whereby it was declared that all rent receiving interest vested in the Government with effect from 14.4.1952, the petitioners paid the rent to the Government Estate up to 1997. During S.A. Survey Operation the name of the petitioners were correctly recorded in the S.A. Khatian, as produced by the petitioner, without any objection from any quarter. But when R.S. record-of-rights had not been prepared and published in the name of the petitioners, they filed Title Suit No. 191 of 2005 for correction of the said record-of-rights and some other ancillary reliefs in the Court of Joint District Judge and Arbitration Court, Dhaka wherein they got decree as prayed for vide judgment and decree dated 12.09.2013. Against the said judgment and decree dated 12.09.2013, defendant of the suit as appellant preferred First Appeal before this Court which is now pending for disposal. The petitioners have been owning and possessing their respective case land as tenants on payment of rates and rent initially to the Bhawal Raj Court of Wards Estate and subsequently to the Government after cessation of the the Zamindery system. During recent Mahanagar Survey Operation, Revenue Authority prepared the draft record-of-rights in respect of the land in question in the names of the petitioners under the provisions of rule 29 of the Rules, 1955. The respondent no. 5   Bhawal Raj Court of Wards Estate thereafter filed the aforesaid objection cases under rule 30 of the Rules, 1955 for removing the names of the petitioners from the draft record-of-rights; the revenue authority after hearing the parties rejected the objection cases of the respondent no. 5. The respondent no. 5 moved the appellate authority under rule 31 of the Rules, 1955 unsuccessfully. The respondent no. 5, Bhawal Raj Court of Wards Estate represented by its Manager filed an application on 10.04.2013 mentioning rule 42A of the Rules, 1955 for hearing the appeal cases afresh. Accordingly, the impugned notices have been issued and served upon the petitioners mentioning section 19(2) of the Act, 1950 read with rule 31 of the Rules, 1955 for taking a decision afresh about the record-of-rights in question.<br/> <br/>Section 144 of the S.A.T. Act states that the Government may, in any case if it thinks fit, make an order directing that the record-of-rights in respect of any district, part of a district or local area be prepared or revised by a Revenue-Officer in accordance with such rules as may be made by the Government in this behalf.<br/> <br/>Chapter VII of the Rules, 1955 deals with the procedure to be adopted by the Revenue Officer for revision of record-of-rights under section 144 of the S.A.T. Act. According to rule 27, ten stages are involved in preparation of the revision of record-of-rights. Among these stages six to ten concern attestation, publication of draft record, disposal of objections, filing of appeals and disposal thereof and preparation and publication of final record-of-rights. After completion of attestation in accordance with the Rules, 1955 and instructions of the settlement department under rule 28, the Revenue Officer, is required to provide opportunity for raising objections, if any regarding the ownership or possession of land or of any interest in the land; while disposing of the objection, the Revenue Officer shall record the brief decision. Rule 28 sets out the procedure of the work, up to attestation. Rule 29 states that after completion of attestation the Revenue Officer shall publish the draft record-of-rights by placing it for public inspection during a period of not less than one month at such convenient place as he may determine informing the persons concerned about the last date of filing objections under rule 30. Rule 30 prescribes procedure for making or giving objection in respect of draft publication of record-of-rights; whereas rule 31 provides the forum for preferring appeal against the order passed under rule 30. Before passing the final order on such an appeal the contending parties shall be afforded the opportunity to present their part of the case. After disposal of appeal under rule 31, the Revenue Officer shall have to take initiative for final publication of the record-of-rights on obtaining necessary permission from the Government to be issued by general or special order for the purpose of printing of the same in manuscript according to rule 32. Under rule 33 the Revenue Officer shall publish the final record-of-rights within 30(thirty) days from the date of receipt of the general or special order of the Government. Rule 34 provides procedure for issuing certificate stating the facts of such final publication. The Government is empowered by sub-rule (2) of Rule 34 to declare notification in the official Gazette that the record-of- rights has been finally published with regard to an specific area for every village and such notification shall be conclusive proof of such publication. Rule 35 speaks about presumption as to the correctness of the record-of-rights. When a record-of-rights is finally published under rule 33, the publication shall be conclusive evidence that the record has been duly revised under section 144 of the S.A.T. Act. Every entry in a record-of-rights finally published shall be presumed to be correct until it is rebutted on taking evidence before the appropriate civil court.<br/> <br/>Chapter VIII of the Rules, 1955 deals with the power of the Settlement Officer in revising record-of-rights under section 144 of the S.A.T. Act. In accordance with rule 36,  a Revenue Officer appointed  with or without additional designation of the Settlement Officer  or  Assistant Settlement Officer for Revision of a record-of-rights under Chapter XVII of the Act  within any district, part of a district or local area, shall have the power  to revise the same upon following the procedure as laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 for the trial of suit; and to enter upon any land included within the area in respect of which an order under section 144 of the Act has been made to survey, demarcate and prepare a map of the same. Rule 40 empowers the Settlement Officer to initiate proceedings relating to objections under rule 30 and appeals under rule 31 for disposal by any Assistant Settlement Officer subordinate to him. Rule 41 empowers the  Settlement Officer to withdraw cases from the file of any Assistant Settlement Officer or Revenue Officer subordinate to him relating to any of the proceedings under Chapter VII and to dispose of the same by himself or by transfer them to any other Assistant Settlement Officer or Revenue Officer subordinate to him for disposal. However, rule 42 provides special power to the Revenue Officer appointed with the additional designation of the Settlement Officer who may at any time before publication of the final record-of-rights direct that any portion of proceedings referred to in rules 28 to 32 in respect of any district, part of a district or local area shall be cancelled and to take up the proceeding afresh from such stage as he may direct. Pursuant to a complaint or on receipt of an official report the Revenue Officer with the additional designation of Settlement Officer has jurisdiction to correct a fraudulent entry in the record-of-rights upon consulting the relevant records and making other inquiries as he may deem necessary and direct excision of the fraudulent entry as per the provision of rule 42A. However, before such excision the contending parties shall be notified giving opportunities of personal hearing. Under rule 42B the Revenue Officer shall make correction of obvious errors i.e. arithmetical or clerical before final publication of the record-of-rights. Rule 44 empowers the Director of Land Records and Surveys to discharge all the aforesaid functions of a Revenue Officer as empowered under the aforesaid Rules including rules 40 to 42.<br/> <br/>The provisions of rules 42 and 42A are reproduced below for ready reference:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>42. <strong>“Special power of Revenue-officer appointed with the additional designation of Settlement Officer</strong>: A Revenue–officer appointed with the additional designation of ‘settlement officer’ may, at any time before the publication of final record-of-rights, direct that any portion of the proceedings referred to in rules 28 to 32 in respect of any district, part of a district, or local area, shall be cancelled and that the proceedings shall be taken up fresh from such stage as he may direct.”</em><br/><em>42A. <strong>Correction of fraudulent entry before final publication of record-of-rights</strong>- The Revenue-officer, with the additional designation of ‘Settlement Officer’ shall, on receipt of an application or on receipt of an official report for the correction of an entry that has been procured by fraud in record-of-rights before final publication thereof, after consulting relevant records and making such other enquiries as he deems necessary, direct excision of the fraudulent entry and his act in doing so shall not be open to appeal,  at the same time, the Revenue-officer shall make the correct entry after giving the parties concerned a hearing and recording  his finding in a formal proceeding for the purpose of future reference.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>On a perusal of both the provisions it appears that rule 42 grants special power to the Revenue Officer to cancel any portion of the proceedings referred to in rules 28 to 32 in respect of any district, any part of a district or local area, and direct the proceedings to be taken up afresh from such stage as he may direct. The word “proceedings” as appearing in rule 42 is to be understood considering the context of each case. In the instant case, after disposal of the appeal under rule 31 of the Rules, 1955 an application was filed before the Settlement Officer at Dhaka mentioning rule 42A of the Rules, 1955 at the instance of the respondent no. 5 praying for hearing of the four appeal cases or taking a decision afresh as mentioned above. Rule 42A of the Rules, 1955 grants power to the Revenue Officer with the additional designation of the Settlement Officer to hear and dispose of any application filed alleging fraud. In the instant case the application as has been filed by the respondent no. 5 mentioning rule 42A is a misconceived one. The Revenue Officer after disposal of the appeal under rule 31 may at any time before final publication of the record-of-rights initiate a proceeding afresh at the stage he may direct. That power of the Revenue Officer has been given under rule 42 of the Rules, 1955. In the instant case, we hold that the application as has been filed by the respondent no. 5 should not be treated as an application under rule 42A  of the Rules, 1955 rather it should be considered as an application under rule 42 thereof. It is to be noted here that misquoting of rule or non-mentioning of a particular section in the concerned application does not preclude the Settlement Officer to act under the applicable provision of the S.A.T. Act and Rules thereof for the purpose of arriving at a correct decision with regard to the final publication of the record-of-rights.<br/> <br/>The contention of the learned Advocate for the petitioners to the effect that final publication of the record-of-rights was made in the name of the petitioners under Khatian No. 1645 under section 144(7) of the Act read with rules 31 and 32 of the Rules, 1955 has been controverted by the learned Deputy Attorney General (D.A.G.) Mr. Sashanka Shekhar Sarker. He produced a letter dated 27.4.2015 under the signature of the Zonal Settlement Officer, Dhaka, on behalf of the respondent no. 2 by way of an affidavit-in-reply dated 09.04.2015, which is reproduced below.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"> <br/>“The Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh”<br/>Zonal Settlement Office, Dhaka<br/>28, Shahid Tejuddin Ahmed Sarani<br/>Tejgaon, Dhaka-1208.<br/>Memo no-31.8.2692022.44.001.14-217                                  dt. 27.4.15<br/>Sub:  An official report in respect of City Jarip Khatian no-1645 belong to Mouza Tejgaon Industrial Area, J.L.No. 06, Police Station-Tejgaon, District-Dhaka.<br/>Ref: 1.

No. 06, Police Station-Tejgaon, district-Dhaka has not yet been finally published and notified by Gazette under section 32, 33 and 34 of the East Bengal Tenancy Rules, 1955 due to pending Civil Suit No. 211/2001 and Writ Petition No. 4912 of 2003.<br/>Signed illegible<br/>27.04.15<br/>Zonal Settlement Officer, Dhaka<br/>Phone: 9131573<br/>Mr. Arobinda Kumar Roy<br/>Assistant Attorney General<br/>Office of the Attorney General for Bangladesh</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>On a perusal of the aforesaid letter as produced by the learned D.A.G. before this Court, it appears that in fact no final record-of-rights has been prepared under Khatian No. 1645 in the name of the petitioners  having regard to the provisions of rules 32, 33 and 34 of the Rules, 1955.It cannot,therefore, be said that the record-of-rights had been finally published in the name of the petitioners as contended by the learned Advocate for the petitioners. Moreover, from Annexure-2, Gazette Notification dated 12<sup>th</sup> April, 2009, it appears that final publication of the record-of-rights had been made except D.P.Khatian No. 1645 along with some other Khatians in respect of Mouza Tejgaon Industrial Area. This being so, for the purpose of arriving at a correct decision about the final publication of the record-of-rights we can easily infer that the final publication of the record-of-rights has not been published in the name of the petitioners with regard to the draft Khatian No. 1645 in compliance with rules 32 and 33 of the Rules, 1955. The draft record-of-right shall accordingly not be conclusive evidence of its publication under section 144 of the Act, 1950. We should however refrain from making any observations in respect of title of the property in question inasmuch as the First Appeal is awaiting disposal before this Court on a similar point. Moreover, the record-of-rights neither creates nor destroys title. It is merely a record of physical possession at the time when it is prepared. With regard to the decisions as referred to by the learned Advocate for the petitioners we find the same not applicable in the context of the present facts and circumstances of the case and accordingly the same are not discussed.<br/> <br/>In view of what has been stated above and considering the relevant provisions of law we are of the view that the Settlement Officer appointed with the additional designation of Assistant Settlement Officer may at any time before final publication of the record-of-rights exercise his jurisdiction under rule, 42 of the Rules, 1955.

Asraf  Ali Talukder Proprietor of M/S Asraf Ali, Village and Post Office-Rampur Bazar, P.S-Kalihati, District- Tangail, to show cause as to why the order No. 16 dated 09.09.2012 (as contained in Annexure-E) passed by the Artha Rin Adalat No.2, Dhaka in Artha Jari Case No. 205 of 2011 (Second Execution Case ) arising out of Artha Rin Suit No. 182 of 2003 entertaining the second execution case under section 28(4) of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 should not be declared to have been passed without lawful authority and of no legal effect.<br/><br/>The short facts, relevant for the purpose of disposal of this <em>Rule</em>, are that the respondent no.3 instituted Mortgage Suit No. 49 of 1992 before the Artha Rin Adalat, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Dhaka impleading the petitioner Janata Bank Limited and another as defendants for realization of Tk. 25,68,852.41 as stood on 31.10.1995. Subsequently on transfer the said suit was registered as Artha Rin Suit No. 182 of 2003. Thereafter, after hearing the parties and on consideration of the materials on record the Adalat decreed the suit vide judgment and decree dated 10.02.2005 and the decree was drawn up and signed on the same day. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and decree dated 10.2.2005, the Janata Bank Limited, as appellant preferred Artha Rin Appeal No. 04 of 2005 before the learned District Judge who transferred the appeal  to the learned Additional District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Dhaka for disposal. The Additional District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Dhaka after hearing the parties dismissed the appeal on 19.11.2009 with certain modifications of the said judgment and decree. The plaintiff decree-holder thereafter filed Execution Case No. 59 of 2011 on 01.03.2011 to materialize the decree before the Artha Rin Adalat, Second Court, Dhaka. The Adalat after hearing the parties and on consideration of the materials on record rejected the application for execution filed by the decree-holder Krishi Bank  vide judgment and order dated 15.6.2011 on the point of limitation since the execution case was not filed within 1(one) year from the date of decree as per the provisions of section 28(2) of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 Thereafter, the decree-holder preferred Second Execution Case No. 205 of 2011 on 01.08.2011 before the Artha Rin Adalat, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Dhaka. The petitioner as judgment-debtor contested the execution case and filed an application contending, <em>inter alia, </em>  that the first execution case having been rejected on the point of limitation, there was no question of filing the second case for execution of the decree. The Executing Court after hearing the parties rejected the application of the petitioner judgment-debtor and registered the second execution case vide order dated 09.09.2012 (“the impugned order”). Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid order dated 09.09.2012 the petitioner approached this Court and obtained the present <em>Rule</em> as stated above. At the time of issuance of the <em>Rule</em> this Court vide order dated 13.05.2013 stayed further proceedings of Artha Jari Case No. 205 of 2011 then pending before the Artha Rin Adalat, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Dhaka for a period of 6(six) months and subsequently on 05.05.2015 the order of stay was extended for a further period of 6(six) months.<br/><br/>This <em>Rule</em> is contested by respondent no. 3 Bangladesh Krishi Bank Limited through Mr. Shaheen Ahmed, learned Advocate who filed affidavit-in-opposition.<br/><br/>Ms. Halima Ferdous, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that the impugned order suffers from gross illegality inasmuch as the first execution case having been rejected on the point of limitation, the institution of the second execution case does not arise. The learned Advocate submits further that since the first execution case was barred by the law  of special limitation under section 28(1) and (2) of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003, continuation of the proceedings of  the second execution case is liable to be declared to have been proceeded without lawful authority and  of no legal effect. <br/><br/>In controverting the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner, Mr. Shaheen Ahmed, learned Advocate for the respondent-bank refers to the express provisions of sub-section(3) of section 28  and submits that when the first execution case is rejected on the point of limitation or disposed of on different pretext, a second execution case can be continued and proceeded if it is filed within 1(one) year from the date of rejection of the first execution case in accordance with sub-section (3) of section 28 of the Artha Rin Adalat, 2003.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate seeks to rely on a decision in the case of <em>Dr. Md. Asauddllah vs Sonali Bank Limited and others</em> reported in 62 DLR 474.<br/><br/>We have heard the learned Advocates for both the parties, perused the materials on record including the writ petition and the annexures thereto and the affidavit-in-opposition as filed by the respondent no. 3.<br/><br/>At first let us see the relevant provisions of law on the issue. Section 28 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 has authorized the Adalat to deal with execution proceedings which runs as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“২৮ (১) <span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">ঝবন কভলভঢ়তঢ়ভষশ অদঢ়,</span> ১৯০৮ এবং ঝবন ইষধন ষপ ইভৎভর ঙক্ষষদনধয়ক্ষন, ১৯০৮ এ ভিন্নতর  যে বিধানই থাকুক না  কেন, ডিত্র্রীদার, আদালত­যা­গ ডিত্র্রী বা আ­দশ কার্যকর করি­ত ইচ্ছা করি­ল, ডিত্র্রী বা আ­দশ প্রদত্ত হওয়ার অনুর্ধ ১(এক) বৎস­রর ম­ধ্য ধারা ২৯ এর বিধান সা­প­ক্ষ জারীর জন্য আদাল­ত দরখাস¹ দাখিল করিয়া মামলা করি­বz<br/>(২) উপ-ধারা (১) এর বিধা­নর ব্যত­য়, ডিত্র্রী বা আ­দশ প্রদা­নর পরবর্তী ১(এক) বৎসর অতিবাহিত হইবার প­র জারী জন্য দা­য়রকৃত  কোন  মামলা তামাদি­ত বারিত হই­ব এবং অনুরূপ তামাদি­ত বারিত মামলা আদালত কার্যা­র্থ গ্রহন না করিয়া সরাসরি খারিজ করি­বz<br/>(৩) জারীর জন্য দ্বিতীয় বা পরবর্তী মামলা,  প্রথম বা পূর্ববর্তী জারীর মামলা খারিজ বা নিস্পত্তি হওয়ার পরবর্তী এক বৎসর সময় উত্তীর্ণ হওয়ার প­র দাখিল করা হই­ল, উক্ত মামলা তামাদি­ত বারিত হই­ব; এবং তামাদি­ত বারিত অনুরূপ মামলা আদালত কার্যা­র্থ গ্রহণ না করিয়া সরাসরি খারিজ করি­ব<br/>জারীর জন্য  কোন নতুন মামলা প্রথম জারীর মামলা দাখি­লর পরবর্তী ৬ (ছয়) বৎসর সময় অতিবাহিত হইবার প­র দাখিল করা হই­ল, উক্ত মামলা তামাদি­ত বারিত হই­ব; এবং তামাদি­ত বারিত অনুরূপ মামলা আদালত কার্যা­র্থ গ্রহণ না করিয়া সরাসরি খারিজ হই­ব”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The aforesaid provisions of section 28 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 (“the Ain”) provides for a special law of limitation for the purpose of dealing with execution proceedings. Sub-section (1) of section 28 has imposed a restriction on the decree holder that the execution case shall have to be filed within 1(one) year from the date of decree subject to the provisions of section 29 of the Ain. Section 29 of the Ain gives special latitude for reckoning the time spent in payment of the decretal amount which to be gathered from the context of the decree. Sub-section (2) of section 28 creates an embargo upon the decree-holder providing the consequence that the execution case shall be rejected if it is not filed in strict compliance with the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 28 within one year from the date of the decree, subject to the provision of section 29 of the Ain.  Sub-section (3) of section 28 speaks about filing of second or subsequent execution case fixing a time limit of 1(one) year from the date of rejection or disposal of the first execution case. Sub-section (4) of section 28 is not relevant for our purpose.<br/><br/>In the instant case, the admitted position is that the first execution was not filed within 1(one) year from the date of the decree in  compliance with the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 28 of the Ain and therefore the first execution case was rejected on 15.6.2011 by the Executing Court under sub-section (2) of section 28. The rights of the decree-holder in accordance with the statute has apparently been extinguished as a legal consequence of the special provision of limitation incorporated therein. Since the first execution case was time barred under the special provision of limitation as provided for in sub-section (2) of section 28 of the Ain, the second execution case if continued,  will render the aforesaid provisions nugatory. It is possible that under sub-section (3) of section 28 of the Ain, a second execution case can be maintained when it is filed within one year from the date of rejection or disposal of the first execution case, however that course is available only when the first execution case is rejected for reasons other than the ground of limitation. If the second execution case is continued after rejection of the first execution case on the point of limitation it will defeat the special provision of limitation as contemplated in the statute.<br/><br/>With regard to the decision as referred to by the learned Advocate for the petitioner we find the same not applicable in the context of the facts and circumstances of the instant case and accordingly the same is not discussed.<br/>It appears from the materials on record that there was a gross negligence of the concerned officials of Bangladesh Krishi Bank Limited in not preferring the execution case in time  and as such an appropriate direction should be given by this Court to the authority concerned of the Bangladesh Krishi Bank Limited. Accordingly, the Managing Director, Bangladesh Krishi Bank Limited is directed to find out who were involved in such negligence through an inquiry and to realize the decreetal amount with interest from the person or persons concerned, liable for such negligence. The Managing Director of the bank is also directed to initiate a departmental proceeding against the person or persons who were involved in such gross negligence, if the same has not been done in the meantime.<br/><br/>Having considered the provisions of law, we find substance in the Rule.<br/><br/>In the result, the Rule is made absolute however, there will be no order as to cost.<br/><br/>The impugned order dated 09.09.2012 passed by the Artha Rin Adalat No.2, Dhaka in Execution Case No. 205 of 2011 is declared without lawful authority and of no legal effect and accordingly the proceeding of the Second Execution Case No. 205 of 2011 is hereby declared to have been continued without lawful authority.<br/><br/>Let a copy of this judgment be sent to the Artha Rin Adalat No. 2, Dhaka and and the Managing Director, Bangladesh Krishi Bank Limited, Krishi Bank Bhaban, 83-84 Motijheel, Dhaka.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

Kamruzzaman, husband of the petitioner and the house was handed over to him on 10.05.2004 (Annexure ''A''&amp;''A-1''). The husband of the petitioner has been transferred by an office order dated 26.06.2014 from Dhaka to Jhalakathi. The petitioner then filed an application on 13.10.2014 to the Respondent No. 2 for allotment of the said house No. 99/26, China Building, Azimpur, Dhaka, in her name which was earlier allotted in the name of her husband (Annexure-B-1). The application has been duly received by the office of the Respondent No. 2. But the said respondent did not pay any attention to the said application. Rather during pendency of the said application the Respondent No. 3 issued an official order dated 05.11.2014 allotting House No, 99/6 and 12 of China Building, Azimpur to the petitioner. On the same date the Respondent No. 3 issued another official order allotting  House No. 99/26 of the same building (the disputed house) to one Md. Selim Sharif who was earlier allocated the House No. 99/6 and 12 of the same building (Annexure-''C''&amp;''C-1''). On receipt of the information about the allotment of House No.99/26 of the  China Building in the name of one Md. Selim Sharif, the petitioner made 2 (Two) representations dated 11.11.2014 and 09.12.2014 for reviewing the decision for allotment of the House No.99/26 of the building in favour of the petitioner but the Respondents did not pay any attention to the said representations of the petitioner till date (Annexure-''D''&amp;''D-1''). While the petitioner was waiting for positive response of the said representations to the utter dismay to the petitioner, the Respondent No. 3 has issued the impugned notice contained in Memo No 140 (এপি)ডিএ/বরাদ্দ/০৩/২০৬ তারিখ: ১৫ ডিসেম্বর ২০১৪ (Annexure- E) requesting her to hand over possession of House No. 99/26 to the Local enquiry office of the Public Works Department, within 7 (seven) days. It was like a bolt from the blue. Referring to an official order dated 10.04.2006 (Annexure-F) the petitioner claimed that on similar circumstances the authority has allocated a house to the wife of the previously allocated person (Annexure -''F''). Hence this Rule.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Motiur Rahaman, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that the petitioner is eligible and qualified to get allotment of accommodation of House No. 99/26 of the China Building previously allocated to her husband but later the allotment has been cancelled because of transfer of her husband from Dhaka to Jhalokathi and as the wife, the petitioner has legitimate expectation to get allotment of the said accommodation. He further submits that earlier a wife has been given allotment of her husband's allotted accommodation during her husband's life time and before retirement from the service, which is a regular practice and thus the petitioner is entitled to get allotment of House No. 99/26 of the building in place of prior allotment in the name of her husband. By making the aforesaid submissions, the learned Advocate for the petitioner prays for making the absolute.<br/><br/>Per contra Mr. K.M. Masud Rumy, the learned Assistant Attorney General, appearing for the respondent No. 1 by filing an affidavit-in-opposition denied the material allegations made in the Writ Petition, contending <em>inter-alia</em> that the Respondent No. 3 issued the impugned letter (Annexure- E) to hand over the possession of the petitioner's accommodation in compliance with the provision of law and there was no illegality or misuse of the statutory power, nor there is any malafide intention, colourable exercise of power by the said respondent. He further submits that the present writ petition is a misconceived one and the same is not maintainable as no writ lies against any action taken or decision made or an order passed by any Government authority in relation to any matter of a Government servant. There is a clear bar in article 117 of the Constitution to approach the High Court Division relating to the terms and conditions of service of the Government employees and the said Article unambiguously prescribes to go before the Administrative Tribunal for any remedy on all service related disputes. As such the writ petition is not maintainable. The learned Assistant Attorney General thus submits that admittedly, the petitioner is in the service of the Republic and the subject matter of the present writ petition is regarding allocation of an accommodation to the petitioner which falls within the meaning of ''Terms and Conditions'' of service of a government employee or a Statutory Public Authority. According to Article 117 of the Constitution, the Administrative Tribunal is the appropriate forum to seek remedy, if any, in respect of the terms and conditions of service of an employee in the service of the Republic and as such the writ petition under Article 102 of the Constitution is not maintainable. He finally submits that in a similar case of <strong><em>Rina Kana Mistry Vs Bangladesh and other</em></strong>, (writ petition No. 2085 of 2013) and in the case of <strong><em>Sohel Ahmed Lian Vs. Bangladesh and others </em></strong>(writ petition No. 8631 of 2011) the High court Division has taken views that on any dispute regarding terms and conditions of employee in the service of the Republic, appropriate forum is Administrative Tribunal Constituted under Article 117 of the Constitution, as such the writ petition under Article 102 of the Constitution is not maintainable. As such he prays that the Rule should be discharged.   <br/><br/>We have heard the learned Advocates of both sides, perused the Writ Petition, affidavit-in-opposition and the annexures appended thereto. We have also gone through the provision of relevant law and the decisions placed before us and considered the same.<br/><br/>Since the question of maintainability of the present Writ Petition has been raised by the learned Assistant Attorney General, this court is required to examine the said issue at first before embarking upon the substantial issue.<br/>Admittedly, the petitioner is in the service of the Republic and the subject matter of the present writ petition is regarding allocation of a government accommodation in favour of the petitioner. Allocation of accommodation to a government servant is an inseparable part of the government service. When a person is employed in any Government post, he becomes entitled to an accommodation and until such accommodation is provided he is paid house allowance in lieu of accommodation.  Therefore, it is an irresistible conclusion of this Court that accommodation of a Government servant does come within the purview of '' terms and conditions'' of service of person in the service of the Republic or a Statutory Public Authority.<br/><br/>Under such circumstances we hold that this writ petition is not maintainable.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the Rule is discharged without any order as to costs.<br/><br/>However, the petitioner shall be at liberty to approach the proper forum prescribed in Article 117 of the Constitution for vindication of his rights and remedies, if any, in accordance with law.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

The informant sent one Bilkis to look for Lubna, but she was not found and at night the informant, having suspected the convict Manik, went to his house at about 1:00 a.m. along with his son and brother-in-law and asked about Lubna, but did not get any information and thereafter on the next day i.e., 20.03.2003 at about 6:00 a.m. daughter of one Abdul Aziz informed that the dead body of Lubna was lying in a bamboo bush of Mohor Ali and then the informant along with this other relatives went to the place and saw his daughter in half naked condition and suspected that his daughter was killed by strangulation after rape by some persons and accordingly the First Information Report (F.I.R.) was lodged on 20.3.2003 which was recorded as Meherpur Police Station Case No. 14 dated 20.03.2003. <br/><br/>The Investigating Officer visited the place of occurrence, prepared the sketch map with index, prepared inquest report, examined the witnesses and recorded their statements under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/>The convict appellant and other three accused persons were arrested by the police on mere suspicion. Thereafter the convict appellant made a confessional statement on 27.3.2003 implicating himself with the alleged offence.<br/>After completion of investigation police submitted Charge-sheet under sections 9(2) of the of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 against the appellant. The other accused persons were not sent up in the charge sheet.<br/>Thereafter, the case was transferred to the learned Judge of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Meherpur for trial and charge was framed against the convict- appellant under section 9(2) of the Nari-O.Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 read with section 201 of the Penal Code which was read over to the appellant to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. <br/><br/>During trial the prosecution examined as many as 20 witnesses and the defence examined 2 witnesses. During the course of examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the appellant again claimed to be innocent and adduced two defence witnesses.<br/><br/>After hearing the parties and considering the evidence and materials on record the learned Judge of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Meherpur, by judgement and order dated 12.10.2004 convicted the appellant under sections 9(2) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 and sentenced him to death with a fine of Tk. 1,00,000/-.<br/><br/>Reference under section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was made to the High Court Division for confirmation of the sentence of death, which was registered as Death Reference No.147 of 2004. Before the High Court Division Criminal Appeal No. 3720 of 2004 and Jail Appeal No.1132 of 2004 were preferred by the condemned prisoner, which were heard along with the death reference. By the impugned judgement and order, the High Court Division accepted the reference and dismissed Criminal Appeal No. 3720 of 2004 and Jail Appeal No.1132 of 2004. Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgement and order of the High Court Division the appellant preferred Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 504 of 2008 before this Division and leave was granted on the following submissions of Mr. Mahbubur Rahman, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the petitioner:</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman"><li style="text-align:justify">That the Courts below failed to consider some important aspects in the case, i.e. not holding of chemical examination of the blood found in the seized clothes of the convict-petitioner and also found at the place of recovery of the dead body and also in the seized clothes of the victim as well as the seized jute bag.</li><li style="text-align:justify">That the Courts below did not consider the age of the convict petitioner who was 16 years as available from the record of the case; and</li><li style="text-align:justify">That though 4 accused persons were arrested but charge sheet has been submitted only against the convict-petitioner although from the facts and circumstances of the case it was shown that the convict petitioner alone could not commit the alleged offence and that the cause of death of the victim is rape. From the post-mortem report it appears that the rape was committed by more than one person. The Courts below erred in not holding that the offence alleged has been committed not by the convict petitioner alone. There is also no direct evidence to prove the offence of rape and killing of the victim by the convict-petitioner, inasmuch as the story of causing death as disclosed in the confessional statement of the convict do not tally with the post-mortem report, since there is no mention of any mark of finger pressure on the throat of the victim.”  </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Mahbubur Rahman, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that the accused is a child within the definition of the Children Act, 1974 and was aged 16 years at the time of the occurrence, but this was not taken into account during the course of trial and as such the trial of the accused as an adult is vitiated and the sentence of death penalty is illegal.<br/><br/>We may deal with this submission outright by reference to the materials on record, namely confessional statement of the accused dated 27.3.2003 and the examination of the accused under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which was dated 11.02.2004. In both of these the age of the accused is shown as 20 years. The charge against the accused was framed on 10.6.2003 (which was the relevant date for considering the age of the accused under the Children Act, 1974) when the accused would have been above 19 years of age. The only other material on record showing the age of the accused is a doctor’s prescription dated 17.3.2003 which shows the accused to be aged 16 years at that time. This, however, is a self-serving piece of evidence produced by the accused through D.W.1. It cannot be taken to be reliable evidence of age. Furthermore, the aspect of the accused being child, was never raised before the trial Court or the High Court Division. The argument put forward by the learned Counsel for the appellant is at best tenuous.<br/><br/>The learned Counsel next submitted that this is a case of no legal evidence against the accused. There was no eye witness to the alleged occurrence of rape and murder, and the post mortem report and the so-called confessional statement of the accused do not at all mention rape of the victim. He also pointed out that the First Information Report (F.I.R.) indicates that the victim was killed after gang rape but no evidence has been led by the prosecution about gang rape and, in fact, other accused persons were not sent up in the charge sheet and were dropped from prosecution. He submitted therefore, that the prosecution has not been able to make out a case of rape and murder.<br/><br/>With regard to the evidence of witnesses relating to the accused calling the victim to his house, he submitted that such a story is not corroborated by any of the witnesses since P.Ws. 9, 11, 12 and 15 did not mention the fact that the accused called the victim and invited her to his house in the evening of the occurrence. He submitted that as such the fact of the victim having been invited by the accused to his house cannot be used as a circumstance against him.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate next submitted that the only evidence relating to complicity of the accused with the murder of the victim is the so-called confessional statement of the accused recorded by the Magistrate under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. By reference to the materials on record, he submitted that the occurrence having taken place on 19.3.2003, the accused was arrested on 23.3.2003 and after being taken on remand for the third time his confessional statement was recorded on 27.3.2003 and the confession was retracted by the accused on 08.4.2003. In this regard he submitted first of all that the case against the accused being one of rape and murder and the confession relating only to the murder of the victim, rape not having been mentioned at all, the confession cannot be said to be true. Thus, there is no evidence in support of the prosecution case. He further submitted that the confession having been recorded after 5 days in police custody, and having been retracted soon thereafter alleging that it was extracted by police torture, cannot be said to be voluntary. He submitted, therefore, that the confession, being not true and not voluntary, it cannot be used against the accused and, therefore, the conviction and sentence is illegal and unwarranted.<br/><br/>Learned Counsel next submitted that the contention of the prosecution that blood stained clothing and other materials recovered from the house of the accused support the prosecution case of rape and murder, is ill-founded. He pointed out that the blood stains were not chemically examined to establish whether it was in fact blood of the victim or of the accused. He reminded us that the defence case was that the accused suffered from tuberculosis (TB) and the blood stains on the clothes and materials recovered from his house were of blood from the accused.<br/><br/>In conclusion the learned Counsel submitted that the case against the accused has not been proved by legal evidence beyond reasonable doubt and as such, the accused is liable to be acquitted.<br/>The learned Counsel lastly pointed out that the accused has been in the condemned cell since the date of the judgement by the trial Court on 12.10.2004. He submitted that the accused has suffered the pangs of death for more than 10 years and as such, even if his conviction is maintained, his sentence of death is liable to be commuted. In this regard he has referred to the decision of this Division in the case of<strong> Nazrul Islam (Md) vs State </strong>reported in<strong> <em>66 DLR (AD) 199. </em></strong> Moreover, he submitted that the accused was very young at the time of commission of the offence and as such, the sentence of death is too harsh. Again, he submitted that in such circumstances the sentence of death is liable to be commuted. In support of his contention he has referred to the decision in the case of <strong><em>The State vs. Tasiruddin </em></strong>reported in <strong><em>13 DLR 203</em></strong> where the age of the offender even up to 27 years has been considered as a ground of commutation of the sentence of death.<br/><br/>Mr. Khandaker Diliruzzaman, learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the respondent made submissions in support of the judgement and order of the High Court Division. In addition he submitted that the incriminating articles recovered from the house of the accused give a clear picture of the accused having murdered the victim inside his own room. He pointed out that as many as 18 items of wearing apparels and bedding recovered from the room of the accused contained blood stains which forms strong circumstantial evidence that the accused murdered the victim inside his room. He pointed out that the recovery of these items on 22.3.2003 was consequent upon an extra judicial confession of the accused. He submitted that this is further endorsed by the subsequent recovery of the sack at 12.15 p.m. on 22.3.2003 in which the accused carried the dead body of the victim and which also had blood stains on it.<br/><br/>The learned D.A.G. further submitted that the confession of the accused recorded by the learned Magistrate was found by both the trial Court and the High Court Division to be true and voluntary. He submitted that the fact that the confession was recorded after taking the accused on remand, does not make the confession illegal since there was no illegality about the remand order and the consequent confinement of the accused. He further submitted that all the requirements of sections 364 and 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure have been complied. He further submitted that the confession being an inculpatory one, the fact that the accused did not mention his act of rape on the victim is a mere omission or suppression on his part, and it does not detract from the voluntariness and truth of the confessional statement. He pointed out that the post mortem report and the inquest report clearly speak of an act of rape having been committed upon the victim, otherwise the injuries mentioned in the post mortem report and observed at the time of inquest could not be explained. In this regard he also submitted that non-mentioning of the presence of signs of rape by the doctor in the post mortem report cannot negate the fact of rape which is evident from the injuries in the private parts of the victim which are noted in the post mortem report and which are shown as the cause of death. The learned D.A.G. submitted also that the evidence of the witnesses clearly corroborate the fact that the victim was invited by the accused to go to his house and, thereafter, she was found dead in the following morning. Lastly, the learned D.A.G. submitted that the recovery of blood stained items of clothing and bedding from the room of the accused clearly proves the complicity of the accused in the offence alleged, and is also supported by the confession of the accused to the effect that he murdered the victim inside his room.<br/><br/>With regard to the defence of the accused that he was suffering from TB, the learned D.A.G. submitted that the evidence of the defence witnesses did not at all support the defence claim that the accused had been suffering from TB and, hence, the attempt to explain the blood stains on the clothing and bedding found in the room of the accused failed miserably. The circumstantial evidence produced in support of the prosecution case could not be shaken by the defence and, hence, the conviction and sentence cannot be said to be illegal.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocate for the appellant and the learned Deputy Attorney General for the respondent, perused the impugned judgement of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record.<br/><br/>There cannot be any doubt that the victim died as a result of a ferocious sexual assault upon her. The injuries found within her private parts as well as in the vicinity of her private parts and her breast clearly indicate that she was brutally raped. However, the extent of the injury, i.e. complete tear of cervix (Uterus) resulting in hemorrhage and shock does not necessarily indicate gang rape. We note from the F.I.R. that the informant merely suspected that his daughter was possibly gang raped and then strangulated. There is no other evidence to suggest that there was gang rape. Moreover, even if there had been gang rape and the other accused were for any reason either discharged or acquitted after trial, that cannot exonerate the accused person-appellant before us from his liability if there is sufficient evidence and materials on record to sustain his conviction. If other accused persons have been wrongly or illegally left out then it is the responsibility of the prosecution to take whatever steps are felt to be necessary in the circumstances. In this appeal we are concerned with the allegations brought against the accused and whether or not those have been satisfactorily proved beyond reasonable doubt by the evidence and materials produced by the prosecution.<br/><br/>The accused was arrested on 22.3.2003 and taken on remand. When interrogated, the accused made certain extra judicial confessions which led to the recovery on the same day of 18 items of clothing, bedding and old paper from the room of the accused consequent upon his confession. Six of these items contained blood stains. On the same day again consequent upon the confession of the accused, two other items, namely old sack and piece of jute rope both with blood stains, were recovered from the roof of the pucca latrine of the accused. The recovery of these items, particularly the blood stains found, fully corroborates the confession of the accused to the effect that he killed the victim in his room and in the process blood from Lubna’s mouth fell on the bed sheet and that he wiped that blood with his <em>lungi </em>and carried the dead body in a sack and left the body near a bamboo bush. In view of this cross corroboration we cannot ignore the circumstantial evidence of the blood stained clothing and bedding nor can we disbelieve the truth of the confessional statement of the accused.<br/>The defence tried to assail the circumstantial evidence of blood stained clothing and bedding etc. by claiming that the accused suffered from TB and that the blood stains were from his own blood. However, the defence story is belied by the evidence of D.W. 1 and D.W. 2, inasmuch as D.W. 1 admitted in his cross examination that this patient did not suffer from TB and there was nothing problematic seen from the X-Ray Plate. We also noted that in his examination in chief D.W.1 admitted that his note regarding blood with sputum and blood with vomit was written as stated by the patient. Hence, the defence having failed to establish that accused suffered from Tuberculosis, the circumstantial evidence indicating the blood stains were from the blood of the victim stands unrebutted. We also note from the evidence of P.W. 21, the Investigating Officer, that there was no suggestion by the defence that the blood stains were not caused by the blood of the victim.<br/><br/>One other circumstance adverted to by the prosecution through the evidence of P.W. 5 is that on the night of occurrence the accused felt unwell and a doctor was called. P.W. 5 stated that he examined the accused in the room in front of the room of the grandfather of the accused. The accused was not unwell but his pulse rate was high and he was very restless. In our view this state of the accused indicates his mental condition after commission of the murder of the victim. According to the confession of the accused the murder took place before Maghrib prayers and he was seen by the doctor after 9:30 p.m. by which time he had disposed of the dead body, incidentally it may be mentioned that, according to the confession of the accused, he disposed of the dead body at a time when the weather was inclement due to rain and strong wind, and among the items recovered from the room of the accused were his trousers which had stains of mud on them.<br/><br/>The prosecution case with regard to the accused inviting the victim to come to his house after visiting the house of her <em>nana</em>, is mentioned in the confessional statement of the accused. The prosecution attempted to corroborate the same by the evidence of P.Ws. 11, 12, and 15 who deposed to the effect that they saw the accused approach the victim and invite her to his house. In addition P.W. 9 also deposed that he heard the victim’s<em> nani </em>say that Lubna told her that she was going to the house of Manik (the accused) on her return journey. The victim’s <em>nani</em> did not depose as a witness and, therefore, the evidence of P.W. 9 in this regard is hearsay and not admissible as evidence. P.Ws. 11 and 15 stated that they saw the accused call the victim near the tea stall and invited her to his house on her way back, but this was not stated to the Investigating Officer, as apparent from the cross-examination of P.W. 21. However, P.W. 12 narrated the story of conversation between the accused and the victim and of her being invited by the accused to his house, but there was no cross-examination regarding this aspect of the Investigating Officer which leaves this part of the evidence of P.W. 12 uncontroverted and this evidence goes to support the confession of the accused with regard to his inviting the victim to his house.<br/>In view of the facts and evidence discussed above, our considered opinion is that the prosecution has been able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the rape and murder of the victim and, therefore, the conviction and sentence cannot be said to be illegal.<br/><br/>However, we have given our anxious thought to the age of the victim who was 20 years old at the time of the occurrence and the fact that he has been in the condemned cell suffering the pangs of death for more than 10 years. In view of the decision referred to by the learned Counsel for the appellant in the case of <strong><em>The State vs. Tasiruddin </em></strong>reported in <strong><em>13 DLR 203</em></strong> and the decision of this Division in the case of<strong> Nazrul Islam (Md) vs State </strong>reported in<strong> <em>66 DLR (AD) 199 </em></strong>where one of us was a party, we are inclined to commute the sentence of death to one of imprisonment of life.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the criminal appeal is dismissed and the sentence of death is modified to one of imprisonment for life. <br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

On transfer the appeal was heard and disposed of by the learned Additional District Judge, Natore, who after hearing the parties and reassessing the evidence on record dismissed the appeal vide judgment and decree dated 31.08.2006 and 06.09.2006 respectively and thereby affirmed the judgment and decree passed by the learned Assistant Judge.<br/><br/>Having aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and decree, defendant-appellants as petitioners preferred this application under Section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained the present rule and also an order of stay.<br/><br/>Mr. Subrata Saha, learned advocate appearing for the petitioners submits that it is stated in the plaint that on 18.09.1976 defendant no.4 was forced to execute and register the kabala in favour of defendant no.1 on pressure of the army officials and plaintiff no.1 as PW.1 deposed that his father was taken away by the army and forced to execute and register the kabala in favour of the defendant no.1, which also corroborated by other PWs, defendant no.4 though alive but did not produce and examine by the plaintiff to prove the story of coercion and execution of the deed forcibly as such, the defendant-petitioners are entitled to get benefit of Section 114 (g) of the Evidence Act., and without considering this legal aspect both the courts below committed error of law resulting error in the decision occasioning failure of justice. He also submits that both the courts below committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice in not holding that the suit is barred by limitation inasmuch as the deed in question was executed and registered in the year 1976 but the suit instituted in the year 1990, long after attaining majority of the plaintiff.. He next submits that the appellate court below passed the judgment and decree without complying the provision of 0rder XLI rule 31 of the Code of Civil Procedure by reassessing the evidence on record. He further submits that both the courts below committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice in not holding that the suit is not maintainable inasmuch as the plaintiff did not pray for cancellation of the deed in question under Section 39 of the Specific Relief Act. He lastly submits that since there is no prayer in the plaint for cancellation of the deed in question under section 39 of the Specific Relief Act the registered deed carries presumption of correctness. In support of his submissions, learned advocate referred to the case of Shishir Kanti Pal and others-Vs- Nur Muhammad and others, reported in 55 DLR (AD) 39, the case of Abani Mohan Saha-Vs- Assistant Custodian (SDO) Vested Property, Chandpur and others, reported in 39 DLR(AD) 223, the case of Akrab Ali and others-Vs- Zahiruddin Kari and others, reported in 30 DLR (SC) 81, the case of Alkas Mia and others-Vs- The State, reported in 25 DLR 398, the case of Aftabuddin Fakir-Vs- Sowdagar Rabi Das &amp; others, reported in 43 DLR 42 and the case of Sufia Khanam Chowdhury-Vs- Faizun Nesa Chowdhury, reported in 39 DLR (AD) 46.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Mr. Ali Imam Khaled Rahim, learned advocate appearing for the opposite party no. 1 submits that both the courts below mainly relies upon the principles of Muslim law in arriving at a finding that the suit land was not transferred for the benefit of minors which is also evident from the recital of the deed in question as such, there is nothing to interfere with the judgment and decree passed by the Court below. He also submits that adverse presumption under section 114(g) of the Evidence Act., is essentially a question of fact and not revisable under this jurisdiction. He next submits that a sale of minor’s property by the minor’s guardian is not binding on the minor if not followed by the principles of Muslim Law relating to transfer of minor’s property. He lastly submits that a document which is void ab initio need not required to be cancelled. In support of his submissions, learned advocate referred to the case of Sufia Khanam Chowdhury -Vs- Faizun Nessa Chowdhury, reported in 1987 BLD(AD) 55, the case of  Kaliappa Gownden, Minor, by next friend Mari Gownden-Vs- Delvasigamani Pillai and another, reported in Indian Cases, Volume-XVIII, Madras 27, the case of  Sree Chitta Ranjan Chakraborty, being deed his heirs. Ashish Chakraborty and others vs. Md. Abdur Rob alias Mvi Md. Abdur Rob, reported in 51 BLT (AD) 135 and the case of Rahimuddin &amp; others-Vs- Abdul Malek Bhuiya and others, reported in 20 DLR 689.<br/><br/>Heard the learned advocates. Perused the revisional application, judgment of the courts below and the lower court records.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the suit land originally belonged to Soimon Bewa who transferred the land in favour of the minors plaintiff and defendant no.5 by a deed of Heba Bil Ewaj. It is also admitted that the defendant no.4, father of the minors, possessed the suit land on behalf of his minor sons and transferred the suit land to defendant no.1 by a registered sale deed dated 18.09.1976.<br/><br/>On perusal of the judgment passed by the courts below it appears that both the courts below arrived at a finding that the suit land was transferred by the defendant no.4 without following the principles relating to transfer of a minor property as guardian i.e. for absolute necessity or advantage of the minors.<br/><br/>Under the Muhammedan Law, the following persons are entitled in the order mentioned below to be guardians of the property of a minor:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“(1) father;</em><br/><em>(2) the executor appointed by the father’s  will;</em><br/><em>(3) the father’s father;</em><br/><em>(4) one executor appointed by the will of the father’s father;”  </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In this regard, I am quoting relevant portion relating to Guardianship or Tutelage from the book “Muhammedan Law Vol.11” authored by Mr. Syed Amir Ali.<br/>With reference to the real or immovable property of the ward, the powers of guardians are more imited and circumscribed.</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>A guardian may not sell his ward’s real property “into his own hands” or into the hands of anyone connected with him under any circumstance.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>He may sell it to a stranger for double its value, or where it is to the manifest advantage of the ward.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>He may also sell it when there are some general provisions in the wasiyet (will) of the testator, which cannot be carried into effect without the sale of the property.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>When the property is required to be sold for the purpose of paying off the debts of the testator, which cannot be liquidated in any other way.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>When the income accruing from the estate is not sufficient to defray the expenditure incurred in its management and the payment of the kharaj (land revenue). </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>When it is in imminent danger of being destroyed or lost by decay.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>When the minor has no other property, and the sale of it is absolutely necessary for his maintenance.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>When it is in the hands of a usurper, and the guardian has reason to fear there is no chance of restitution.</em></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">In the case of Kaliappa Gownden, Minor, by next friend, Mari Gownden vs. Deivasigamani Pillai and another, reported in Indian Cases Volume-XVIII, Madras 27, their lordships held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“A sale of minor’s property by the minor’s guardian will not be binding on the minor where the sale price has not been afterwards property invested, as where the guardian purchased other lands with only a part of the sale consideration. The vendee cannot seek protection on the ground that he duly paid the stipulated consideration to the guardian. He is at least bound to show that, after making due inquires, he believed that the purchase-money was intended to be used for a purpose which would make the sale beneficial to the minor. It is not enough that he believed the guardian’s statement or the recital in the deed of sale.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In appears that both the courts below arrived at a finding that at the time of execution and registration of the sale deed transferring the minors property the conditions as described above were not in existence rather it appears other way around. Both the courts below also arrived at a finding that after attaining majority, the plaintiff instituted the suit within the statutory period of limitation.<br/> <br/>Learned Advocate for the petitioner argued that the since there is no prayer in the plaint for cancellation of the deed under Section 39 of the Specific Relief Act., registered deed in question carries presumption of correctness as such, the suit is not maintainable . This point already settled by our apex court in the case of Sree Chitta Ranjan Chakraborty vs. Mr. Abdur Rob, reported in 5 BLT (AD) 139, holding that where a written instrument is abinitio void and the transaction is a nullity, the plaintiff is not required to have it cancelled or set aside.<br/> <br/>Now it is settled that under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure the High Court Division cannot re-appreciate the evidence and cannot set aside concurrent finding of the courts below. The High Court Division is empowered only to interfere with the findings of fact, if the findings are perverse or there has been a non-appreciation or non-consideration of the material evidence on record by the court below. Going through the impugned judgment and decree, I do not find any findings of fact recorded by the court below are perverse and there has been non application of mind.<br/><br/>Under the facts and circumstances of the case and for the reasons stated above, I do not find any merit in the rule.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the rule is discharged.<br/><br/>Judgment and decree dated 31.08.2006 and 06.09.2006 respectively passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Natore, in Title Appeal No.147of 2001 affirming the judgment and decree dated 15.04.2001 and 22.04.2001 respectively passed by the learned Assistant Judge, Bagatipara, Natore, in Other Class Suit No.90 of 1999 is maintained.<br/><br/>The order of stay granted at the time of issuance of the Rule is hereby vacated.<br/><br/>Send down the lower court records alongwith a copy of this judgment to the court concern at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Moreover, the Hon’ble Chief Justice of Bangladesh by order dated 15.02.2015 sent Writ Petition No. 9656 of 2011 for hearing by this Bench along with the other writ petitions. So, these writ petitions have been heard together and are being disposed of by this common judgment.<br/><br/>In the above mentioned writ petitions, the petitioners have challenged the legality of making final assessments dated 16.11.2011 of their imported goods (Annexure-F to the respective writ petitions). The petitioners also sought for a direction upon the respondents to make final assessments of their respective imported goods on the basis of Value Information as evident from Annexures-C and D to the respective writ petitions following the provision of rule 5(4) of the  শূল্ক মূল্যায়ন (আমদানীকৃত পন্যের মূল্য নির্ধারন) বিধিমালা, ২০০০ (hereinafter referred to as the Rules). The petitioners further sought for a direction upon the respondents to return the bank guarantees furnished by the respective petitioners at the time of releasing their respective imported goods (white sugar).<br/><br/>At the outset, it be mentioned that Annexure-F to the respective writ petitions are not final assessments of the imported goods, as claimed by the petitioners, but an order for making assessments. However, respondent No. 1 has not denied the statements made in the writ petitions about the final assessments, rather admits the said statements. So, further discussion is not necessary on it.<br/><br/>It be further mentioned that the record of Writ Petition No. 9658 of 2011 could not be produced by the relevant Writ Section and it is verbally reported by the Writ Section Superintendent that the record is missing. Therefore, the Writ Section has been verbally directed to take necessary steps for reconstruction of the record and the same is under process. In this circumstance, though the Hon’ble Chief Justice passed an order for hearing of the above writ petitions as well as Writ Petition No. 9658 of 2011, we were unable to hear Writ Petition No. 9658 of 2011.<br/><br/>Facts of the writ petitions are more or less similar except the letters of credit (the L/C) numbers, the quantities of imported white sugar, countries of origin, invoice value, assessed value, etc. Therefore, to avoid unnecessary repetition, the facts of the cases are summarized as under:-<br/><br/>The petitioners are carrying on import businesses in their respective proprietary firms under various names and styles as mentioned in the respective writ petitions. The petitioners are registered as importers with the Office of the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports and engaged in the business of import of white sugar from abroad. The petitioners imported various quantities of white sugar from Brazil and Thailand by opening L/Cs on various dates. After arrival of the said goods, the petitioners submitted bills of entry on various dates with the office of respondent No. 1, the Commissioner of Customs, Customs House (Import), Chittagong (hereinafter stated as the Commissioner) for release of the goods for the purpose of home consumption. The invoice values of the white sugar were US$ of various amounts, but the Customs Authority without accepting the invoice values assessed the goods at higher rates per metric ton arbitrarily. Thereafter, the petitioners filed Writ Petitions No. 3152 of 2005, 5388 of 2004, 2850 of 2005, 4248 of 2004, 3987 of 2005, 5553 of 2005, 5554 of 2005, 7723 of 2005, 4722 of 2005, 4138 of 2005, 3920 of 2005, 3146 of 2005, 3922 of 2005, 5401 of 2004, 6656 of 2005 and 3783 of 2005 before the High Court Division. Whereupon, Rules were issued upon the respondents with ad-interim orders directing the respondents to release the goods on payment of duties, taxes and other charges on the basis of invoice values in cash and on furnishing bank guarantees for the difference of duties and taxes between the invoice values and the values assessed by the Customs Authority. The respective petitioners released their goods after payment of duties and taxes on the basis of invoice values in cash and by furnishing bank guarantees for the amount of difference between the invoice values and the values demanded by the Customs Authority. Eventually, the High Court Division, upon hearing of the aforesaid writ petitions, by judgment dated 17.04.2008 passed in Writ Petition No. 2850 of 2005, judgment dated 11.03.2008 passed in Writ Petition No. 4248 of 2004, judgment dated 11.03.2008 passed in Writ Petitions No. 3152 of 2005 and 5388 of 2005, judgment dated 23.03.2008 passed in Writ Petitions No. 3987 of 2005, 5554 of 2005, 5553 of 2005, 4723 of 2005, 4722 of 2005 and 4138 of 2005 and judgment dated 12.03.2008 passed in Writ Petitions No. 3920 of 2005, 3146 of 2005, 3922 of 2005, 5401 of 2004, 6656 of 2004 and 3783 of 2005 disposed of the Rules issued in the above writ petitions with similar directions to the concern customs authority to finally assess the imported white sugar to duties in accordance with the Customs Act, 1969 and the Rules.<br/>Thereupon, some of the petitioners filed Civil Petitions for Leave to Appeals No. 1092 to 1103 of 2008 before the Appellate Division and the said leave petitions were dismissed by common order dated 07.04.2009.<br/><br/>Thereafter, the petitioners filed applications before the Commissioner to release the bank guarantees after making final assessments. Eventually, the Commissioner opened various Nathies for final assessments purpose. Then respondent No. 2, Joint Commissioner of Customs on 28.07.2011, in order to make final assessments of the petitioners’ consignments requested the Commissioner to form a committee with higher officials. The Commissioner then formed a committee comprising of respondents No. 2 to 6. Thereafter, the Commissioner wrote letter to respondent No. 7 to supply information in respect of imported white sugar in order to make final assessments in the light of the judgments passed by the High Court Division. Whereupon, respondent No. 7 wrote a letter to the Commissioner to supply materials in respect of imported goods, namely, white sugar. Thereupon, the Commissioner wrote a letter to respondent No. 7 annexing all information and data in respect of imported white sugar. Respondent No. 7 then submitted value prepared on the basis of data base to the Commissioner in respect of the goods imported from France, Brazil and Thailand. From the information supplied by respondent No. 7, it is evident that the lowest value of the imported goods of Brazil origin is US$ 178 per metric ton. Subsequently, respondent No. 7 submitted another value information prepared on data base to the office of the Commissioner. From the said information, it is evident that the lowest price of imported goods of Guatemala, Colombia and India origin were US$ 184.97, 184.65 and 194.95 per metric ton respectively. The Commissioner did not make final assessments and was delaying the matters. So, at the instance of the petitioners, the learned Advocates issued contempt notices upon the Commissioner and after receiving the contempt notices, the Commissioner asked the petitioners to supply the documents in support of their respective values. The petitioners, in reply, informed the Commissioner that they had already submitted documents at the time of releasing of the goods in support of their valuations and, as such, they are unable to submit any additional valuation informations. Eventually, final assessments were made by the Customs Authority.<br/><br/>The countries of origin of the imported sugar, the bills of entry dates, invoice values, assessed values, etc. of respective writ petitions are described in the following table:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size:18px">Table</span></strong><br/> </div><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="height:1951px; width:675px"><tbody><tr><td style="height: 53px; width: 47px; text-align: center;">Sl<br/>			No</td><td style="height: 53px; width: 80px; text-align: center;">Writ Petitions No.  with previous writ petitions No.</td><td style="height: 53px; width: 156px; text-align: center;">Names of the petitioners</td><td style="height: 53px; width: 72px; text-align: center;">Country of Origin</td><td style="height: 53px; width: 66px; text-align: center;">Bills of Entry dated</td><td style="height: 53px; width: 60px; text-align: center;">Invoice Value (per metric ton)</td><td style="height: 53px; width: 54px; text-align: center;">Assessed Value (per metric ton)</td><td style="height: 53px; width: 52px; text-align: center;">Final Assessed value (per metric ton)</td></tr><tr><td style="height: 11px; width: 47px; text-align: center;">1.</td><td style="height: 11px; width: 80px; text-align: center;">9656 of 2011<br/>			(5553/2004)</td><td style="height: 11px; width: 156px; text-align: center;">Md.

The petitioners not being satisfied with the assessments filed the above mentioned writ petitions and as per direction of the High Court Division, the goods were released pursuant to interim orders passed in Writ Petition No. 5553 of 2005 and others. The petitioners already got delivery of their respective goods upon provisional assessments on payment of the customs duties, taxes, etc. in cash according to the invoice values and on furnishing bank guarantees for the difference between the invoice values and the assessed values. The Rules were subsequently heard by a Division Bench and after hearing both parties, the Rules were disposed of with direction to finally assess white sugar in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules and the petitioners were also directed to produce the papers and documents, if any, in support of the invoice values. The petitioners then preferred Civil Petitions for Leave to Appeals being No. 1092 to 1103 of 2008 before the Appellate Division. Eventually, the leave petitions were dismissed on 07.04.2009 by a common judgment with some observations to finally assess the imported white sugar. Respondent No. 1 as per observations of the High Court Division made in the judgment dated 23.03.2008 determined the values of white sugar following the Rules and final assessments were made properly and, as such, the application to release the bank guarantees after making final assessments cannot be entertained. Respondent No. 7 categorically admitted that he has not collected the value informations of identical and/or similar goods from internet or other sources, because his office had no subscription for collecting the same through internet and, as such, the value contained in the letter of respondent No. 7 could not be considered as proper value for final assessments. As per order of the High Court Division, the petitioners were obliged to produce documents in favour of their invoice values, if any, but the petitioners did not produce any document in support of the invoice values. Notices were not required before making final assessments inasmuch as the final assessments were made as per direction of the High Court Division and the respondents as per direction of the High Court Division wrote letters to the respective petitioners to produce the documents in favour of their invoice values and therefore, the petitioners got opportunity to produce documents, if there be any, before final assessments. The Customs Authority determined the value of the goods in compliance with all legal formalities of the Rules by collecting the relevant data base and the value information obtained from internet and other sources from Brazil, Thailand, India, Guatemala and Columbia and the Commissioner of Customs and the duly constituted committee in comparison with the values of white sugar assessed the value of the goods in accordance with law. The final assessments were made by the Customs Authority as per rule 5(4) of the Rules. The petitioners had an equally efficacious alternative remedy by way appeals under section 193 of the read with rule 13 of the Rules. Therefore, without exhausting the alternative remedy available to the petitioners, the writ petitions are not maintainable. Thus, the Rules are liable to be discharged.<br/><br/>Respondent No. 2 filed an affidavit-in-compliance stating that it is apparent from the order issued by the National Board of Revenue (shortly, NBR) vide Nathi No. <strong>শুল্ক মূল্যঃ/শুমূদঃ/২০০১/৯৪১</strong> dated 13.07.2002 (the Order, in brief) that respondent No. 7, the Commissioner of Customs, Valuation and Internal Audit Commissionerate has jurisdiction as per section 3 of the Customs Act to supply information in respect of customs valuation purposes; that as per clause (K)of the Order of NBR, the Commissioner of Customs, Valuation and Internal Audit Commissionerate has to perform his function as co-ordinator in respect of Customs Valuation and as per clause (2) of the order he has to assist the Board and/or Customs Authority to be updated in determining the value by collecting different publications from WTO, WCO, etc., preserve it and supply value information, if necessary; that respondents No. 2-6 have the exclusive authority to determine the correct value of the goods and respondent No. 7 has to play the role as auxiliary and/or as co-ordinator under clause (3) of the Order which provides,--“for Valuation Data Base (VDB) <strong>তৈরী, হালনাগাদকরন ও মাঠ পর্যায়ে বিতরন এর লখে বিষয়ে প্রকাশিত আমত্মর্জাতিক জানাল, বুলেটিন, সংবাদপত্র এবং ইন্টারনেট থেকে মূল্য তথ্য সংগ্রহ এবং সংর্গহীত তথ্য সমন্নয় সম্পাদন.’’</strong> But from Annexures-C and D as supplied by respondent No. 7, it was found that data base was prepared on the basis of disputed invoices supplied by the petitioners and in column No. 4 <strong>(</strong>Ab¨vb¨ g~j¨ ev Ab¨ m~Î) it was categorically written that “cvIqv hvq bvB’ and respondent No. 7 has shown the reason that due to non-availability of data for want of subscription, minimum value of assessed goods from internet and other sources could not be found and, as such, he has supplied a fruitless data base (recorded on the basis of invoice) which does not reflect the proper transaction value as well as the true picture of real transaction value of international market price; that it is crystal clear that respondent No. 7 has not discharged his function and duty properly and he has supplied the data base most whimsically; that for this reason customs authority lawfully by ignoring the data, as supplied by respondent No. 7 (without discharging his function properly), determined the values by collecting the values of identical goods from internet and other sources properly by a duly constituted assessment committee having lawful jurisdiction and, as such, the values as determined by the Customs Authority through final assessments cannot be the subject matter of writ jurisdiction. Therefore, the Rules are liable to be discharged.<br/><br/>Respondent No. 7 submitted an affidavit-in-reply stating that he was appointed as Commissioner of Customs, Valuation and Internal Audit Commissionerate as per section 3(d) of the Customs Act, 1969; that he performed his duty as per the direction of NBR as contained in Nathi No. (3) ïé g~j¨t/ïg~`t/ 2001/941 dated 13.07.2002; that different type of publications and journals regarding valuation of Imported Articles are sent to NBR and NBR, if thinks it proper, sends the journals and publications to his office for preservation and upgrading the valuation data base; that the Customs and Internal Audit Commissionerate works to help the customs houses to determine proper and actual value of the imported commodities for making assessment to duties; that in each of the customs houses, there is existing assessment committee and if there is any objection about assessments of imported goods, then the assessment committee solves it; that in the present cases, respondent No. 7 had tried to collect value information from internet, but did not get any information regarding price anywhere by different searches of ‘sugar price’, ‘raw sugar price’, ‘price of sugar from Brazil.’ So, his office rightly wrote ‘Not available’; that in the present writ petitions, after searching the value of white sugar, his office supplied highest and lowest value to the Chittagong Customs Houses based on 100 bills of entry of sugar imported from Brazil, India, Guatemala and some bills of entry of Thailand; that in the letter dated 25.09.2011 his office gave information of highest and lowest prices.<br/><br/>The petitioners filed an affidavit-in-reply in Writ Petition No. 9656 of 2011 stating that the value of the goods should be determined considering the value supplied by respondent No. 7, vide Annexures-C and D to the writ petitions, following the Rules. Therefore, the final assessments were made by the customs authority without following the Rules on arbitrary basis and therefore, the assessments were unlawful.<br/><br/>Mr. A. F.

M. Maniruzzaman, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing with Mr. Titus Hillol Rema and Ms. Sultana Rahman, the learned Assistant Attorney Generals, on behalf of respondent No. 1, at the outset, submits that identical facts and questions of law are involved in all the writ petitions. Therefore, the affidavit-in-opposition submitted by respondent No. 1 in Writ Petition No. 9656 of 2011 be treated as affidavit-in-opposition in all the cases. Mr. Maniruzzaman takes us through the affidavit-in-opposition and the materials on record, section 193 of the Customs Act, 1969 and rule 5(4) of the Rules and forwards before us the following arguments:-</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;">as per direction of the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 5553 of 2005 and others, to make final assessments of the petitioners’ imported white sugar following the Act and the Rules, respondent No. 1 constituted a committee for finally determining the valuation of the goods;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">the respective petitioners were asked to submit documents following the order of the High Court Division in support of their respective invoice values of white sugar, but the petitioners did not submit any document in support of their respective invoice values;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">the committee, after considering the valuation of imported sugar available from data base and all other available documents finally assessed the goods to duties in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">from the affidavit-in-compliance filed by respondent No. 2, it is evident that the data base supplied by respondent No. 7 was prepared on the basis of disputed invoices supplied by the petitioners and it was categorically written that “cvIqv hvq bvB” and respondent No. 7 clearly stated that due to non-availability of the data base for want of subscriptions, the valuations of the imported goods could not be found and, as such, he supplied a fruitless data base on the basis of invoices which did not reflect the proper transaction value and, as such, there was no scope to consider Annexures-C and D supplied by respondent No. 7;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">in the circumstances, duly constituted assessment committee, having lawful jurisdiction, finally assessed the valuation of the imported sugar following the provisions of the Rules by collecting assessed values of the goods during that time and the value of international market from data base;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">after final assessments of the goods, the petitioners ought to have filed appeals under section 193 of the Act and rule 13 of the Rules;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">the writ petitions have been filed as a cunning device to avoid encashment of the bank guarantees;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">since there is an alternative efficacious remedy in the forum of appeal, the instant writ petitions challenging the final assessment orders are not maintainable and therefore, the Rules are liable to be discharged.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">In reply, Mr. A. F. Hasan Arif, the learned Advocate for the petitioners, submits that according to rule 5(4) of the Rules, if different values of identical goods are available, in such cases, final assessments have to be made on the minimum value available to the Customs Authority. He next submits that from Annexures-C and D as supplied by respondent No. 7 it is evident that the minimum values of imported white sugar supplied by him was the lower than the value assessed by the Customs Authority and, as such, the final assessments have been made beyond jurisdiction and therefore, the Rules are liable to be made absolute.<br/> <br/>In support of his submissions, Mr. A. F. Hasan Arif has relied on the decisions of the following cases:-</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">Salim (Md.) Vs. Assistant Commissioner of Land and Chairman, Debt Settlement Board and others reported in 54 DLR (2002) 72;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Angana Ranjan Chakma Vs.

Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Internal Resources Division and others).</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> In reply, Mr. S. M. Maniruzzaman contends that the assessment authority had legal jurisdiction to finally assess the goods and no question has been raised by the petitioners that the persons who assessed the goods finally were not competent/empowered to assess the goods finally under the Rules.<br/>         He next contends that for argument sake, even if it is presumed that final assessments were made wrongly by the assessing authority, in such case also, the petitioners’ remedy lies before the appellate forum and not in writ jurisdiction.<br/> <br/>In support of his arguments, Mr. Maniruzzaman has referred to the following cases:-</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;">Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Internal Resources Division and others Vs. Sherajul Islam reported in 20 BLC (AD) (2015) 64 and</li><li style="text-align: justify;">an unreported judgment dated 23.07.2014 passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 4406 of 2012 with Writ Petitions No. 4406 of 2012 and 5789 of 2012 (Khandker Mannan Hossain and others; Khandker Abdul Latif Vs. the Commissioner of Customs, Customs House, Chittagong and others.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> We have examined the writ petitions, the affidavit-in-oppositions filed by respondent No. 1, the affidavit-in-compliance filed by respondent No. 2, the affidavit-in-reply filed by respondent No. 7 against the affidavit-in-opposition filed by respondent No. 1 and the affidavit-in-reply filed by the petitioners. We have also studied the relevant provisions of section 193 of the Act, rule 5(4) of the Rules and the decisions as referred to by the learned Advocate for the petitioners and the learned Deputy Attorney General.<br/> <br/>In view of the submissions as advanced by the learned Advocate for the petitioners and the learned Deputy Attorney General, the questions to be determined in these writ petitions are:-</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">whether the instant writ petitions are maintainable?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">whether the impugned final assessments are lawful?</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">It is an admitted proposition and a matter of record that the petitioners are importers of white sugar from various countries of origin as mentioned hereinbefore in the Table. It is further admitted that the petitioners after import of white sugar from various countries submitted bills of entry of various dates for release of their imported goods i.e. white sugar on the invoice values. Further, that the Customs Authority assessed goods to duties at a higher rate than the invoice values supplied by the respective petitioners. There is also no dispute that the petitioners then preferred several writ petitions as mentioned hereinbefore and on the basis of ad-interim directions, the imported goods were released on payment of duties, taxes, etc. in cash on the invoice values and on furnishing bank guarantees for the difference between the invoice values and the assessed values.<br/> <br/>Though, in course of arguments, it was submitted that by a common judgment dated 23.03.2008 the High Court Division disposed of all those writ petitions, but on scrutiny of the records, it transpire that High Court Division by several judgments of various dates disposed of the earlier writ petitions with some other writ petitions, being, judgment dated 17.04.2008 passed in Writ Petition No. 2850 of 2005, judgment dated 11.03.2008 passed in Writ Petition No. 4248 of 2004, judgment dated 11.03.2008 passed in Writ Petitions No. 3152 of 2005 and 5388 of 2005, judgment dated 23.03.2008 passed in Writ Petitions No. 3987 of 2005, 5554 of 2005, 5553 of 2005, 4723 of 2005, 4722 of 2005 and 4138 of 2005 and judgment dated 12.03.2008 passed in Writ Petitions No. 3920 of 2005, 3146 of 2005, 3922 of 2005, 5401 of 2004, 6656 of 2004, 3783 of 2005.<br/> <br/>However, it transpires from the above judgments that in all cases, the High Court Division disposed of the Rules with directions to the concern customs authority to finally assess the imported white sugar to duty in accordance with the Customs Act, 1969 and the Rules on consideration of the papers or documents, if any, that may be produced by the petitioner in support of the invoice value within a period of thirty days of receipt of this order positively and also that the Customs Authority shall be at liberty to encash the bank guarantee(s) deposited for clearance of the goods if the amount that becomes due after such final assessment is not paid in cash within 15 days thereof, in each of the cases.<br/> <br/>Admittedly, some of the petitioners then preferred Civil Petitions for Leave to Appeals No. 1092 to 1103 of 2008 before the Appellate Division. The said leave petitions were dismissed by the Appellate Division by judgment dated 23.04.2009 with the following observations:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“The concerned customs authority is hereby directed to finally assess the imported white sugar with duty in accord, 2000 in the light of observation in Writ Petition No. 6643 of 2004 and on consideration of the papers or documents, if any, that may be produced by the petitioner in support of the invoice value within a period of thirty days of receipt of this order positively.<br/>Mr. Mahmudul Islam, learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that direction may be given to the Customs Authority for allowing the petitioner a hearing to consider the papers and documents, if any, in support of the invoice value.<br/>In the facts and circumstances of the case, we feel that no such order is necessary to get the papers clarified in support of the invoice value.<br/>Accordingly, the leave petitions are dismissed.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Thereafter, eventually, the goods were finally assessed by the Customs Authority and then the Customs Authority issued letter dated 16.11.2011 vide Annexure-G to the respective writ petitions to encash the bank guarantees. The petitioners then once again filed the instant writ petitions for assessments of the imported goods on the basis of valuation information Annexures-C and D to the respective writ petitions following the provisions of the Rules and to direct return of the bank guarantees.<br/>In the above background of the cases, let us consider the first question i.e. on maintainability of the writ petitions.<br/>To decide the question, it is necessary to study the relevant provisions of section 193 of the Act and rules 5(4) and 13 of the Rules.<br/>For better understanding, the aforesaid provisions are quoted below:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“<strong>Section 193. Appeals to Commissioner (Appeal)—</strong>(1) <strong>Any person aggrieved by any decision or order passed under this Act, </strong>not being a decision or order passed under section 82 or section 98, <strong>by an officer of customs lower in rank than a Commissioner of Customs, may appeal to the Commissioner (Appeal) within three months from the date of communication to him of such decision or order: </strong><br/>Provided that the Commissioner (Appeal) may, if he is satisfied that the appellant was prevented by sufficient causes from presenting the appeal within the aforesaid period of three months, allow it to be presented within a further period of two months.<br/>(2) Every appeal under this section, shall be in such form and shall be verified in such manner as may be specified by rules made in this behalf .”<br/>(Bold, emphasis given)<br/>‘‘অভিন্ন পণ্যের (identical goods) বিনিময় মূল্য।-<br/>-------------------------------------<br/>(৪) <u>এই বিধির অধিন অভিন্ন পণ্যের একাধিক বিনিময় মূল্য পাওয়া গেলে উহাদের মধ্যে সর্বাপেÿ কম বিনিময় মূল্যের ভিত্তিতে আমদানিকৃত পণ্যের মূল্য নির্ধারণ করিতে হইবে।’’</u><br/>‘‘১৩। আপীল।- আমাদানিকৃত পণ্যের মূল্য নির্ধারণের ÿÿত্রে আমদানিকারখের ঘোষিত মূল্য ব্যতীত এই বিধিমালায় বর্ণিত কোন পদ্ধতিতে ভিন্নতর মূল্য নির্ধারণ করা হইলে আমাদানিকারককে সেই সম্পর্কে উক্ত মূল্য নির্ধারণের তারিখেই লিখিতভাবে অবহিত করিতে হইবে এবং কোন<u> সংÿুব্ধ আমদানিকারক আইনের </u><u>section 193</u><u> অথবা, ÿÿত্রমত, ংবপঃরড়হ ১৯৬ এর অধীন উক্ত মূল্য নির্ধারণের বিরম্নদ্ধে আপীল দায়ের করিতে পারিবেন।’’</u><br/>(Underlined by us)<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">It is true that under rule 5(4) of the Rules, the Customs Authority has to assess goods on the minimum value available for identical goods, but, under rule 13 of the Rules, if the goods are assessed in any other procedure under the Rules except the value declared by the importer, in such case, the aggrieved importer has to file an appeal under section 193 or section 196, as the case may be, of the Act against the valuation of the goods.<br/>Now, let us study the decisions as referred to by the contending parties.<br/>In the case reported in 54 DLR 72, as referred to by Mr. Arif, it was decided by the High Court Division that,--<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">            “it is borne out from record that <strong>the impugned order was corum non judice having been passed by the Chairman of the Board alone without the presence and participation of other members who also did not sign the impugned order. As a Result the impugned order was wholly without jurisdiction and hence void. </strong>It is needless to mention here that section 5 of the Limitation Act was not applicable in the instant case. Moreover, the impugned order as we have found is illegal and without jurisdiction. Therefore, the petitioner, in our opinion, is not debarred from invoking writ jurisdiction of this Court under Article 102 of the Constitution without availing of the alternative remedy by way of appeal before the Revenue Authority.”<br/>            (Bold, emphasis given)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In this referred case, the constitution of the Debt Settlement Board itself was not proper, as there was absence of two other members and the Chairman alone passed the impugned order. So, the order was corum non-judice. This is not the scenario of the instant cases.<br/>In the case reported in 31 DLR 184, it was decided by the High Court Division as under:-<br/> <br/>“It is true that an alternative remedy was available but it was not availed of. Ordinarily writ jurisdiction is not available to a person who does not seek alternative remedy provided by law but this provision may be waived if an impugned order is, on the face of it, without jurisdiction or is violative of any provision of the Constitution.”<br/> <br/>In this case, the High Court Division decided that writ jurisdiction may be availed of on the ground that the notice served was not a notice as contemplated in Article 177 of the late Constitution. This is not also relevant to the present cases.<br/>However, we are in agreement with the view taken by their lordships in the above two cases as referred by Mr. Arif that if an order is corum non-judice/without jurisdiction, a person may invoke writ jurisdiction in such case.<br/>The 3<sup>rd</sup> case referred by Mr. A. F. M. Hasan Arif is the unreported judgment dated 19.01.2015 passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 2777 of 2006. This case is relating to declaration that assessment of duty @ 25% is violative of Article 27 of the Constitution being discriminatory. So, the facts and circumstances of this case is quite distinguishable from the instant cases and, as such, this decision is not also applicable here.<br/>The latest decision of the Appellate Division as placed before us by the learned Deputy Attorney General is the decision reported in 20 BLC (AD) 64. The judgment of this case was delivered on July 22, 2014. In this case, their lordships decided as under:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“Admittedly, the respondent has filed the writ-petition challenging the order dated 31-1-1995 (Annexure-E to the writ-petition), that is, the <strong>assessment</strong><strong> made by the Customs Authority on the imported goods. Such assessment made by the Customs Authority can only be challenged by filing an appeal as proved under section 193 of the Customs Act. </strong>Section 193 of the Customs Act as quoted below:<br/>‘193. Appeals to Commissioner (Appeal)—(1) Any person aggrieved by any decision or order passed under the Act, not being a decision or order passed under section 82 or section 98, by an officer of customs lower in rank than a Commissioner of Customs, may appeal to the Commissioner (Appeal) within three months from the date of recommendation to him of such decision or order.<br/>Provided that the Commissioner (Appeal) may, if he is satisfied that the appellant was prevented by sufficient causes from presenting the appeal within the aforesaid period of three months, allow it to be presented within a further period of two months.<br/> <br/>Every appeal under this section, shall be in such form and shall be verified in such manner as may be specified by rules made in this behalf.’<br/> <br/><strong>Having considered the above section, we find that a person aggrieved by a decision or order passed, under this Act may appeal to the Commissioner (Appeal) within 3 (three) months from the date of communication to him of such decision or order. </strong><br/><strong>The assessments order dated 31-1-1995 comes within the purview of section 193 of the Customs Act and, as such, the writ petition filed by the respondent before the High Court Division was not at all maintainable. </strong><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">In this connection, reliance may be placed on the case of Bangladesh vs Mizanur Rahman, 52 DLR 149, in which, it has been held as under:<br/> <br/>‘In the instant case, the writ-petitioner released the imported goods on payment of the assessed duty and he neither preferred an appeal against the order of assessment under section 193 of the Act nor fled any application for refund of the alleged excess duty under section 33 of the Act nor gave any explanation for non filing of any appeal or application for refund. <strong>In the face of provisions for appeals under sections 193 and 196 of the Act and also provision for refund of any excess duty under section 33 of the Act within six months of such payment his writ petition is not maintainable.’ </strong><br/>Having considered the case referred to the above, <strong>we are of the view that the principle expounded in the above case applies to the facts and circ-umstances of the present case and therefore, they very writ </strong><strong>petition filed by the respondent</strong><strong> was not maintainable. </strong><br/>Classification of the imported goods and assessment thereon by the Customs Authority are disputed questions of fact which could not be resolved in the writ jurisdiction. The High Court Division exercised writ jurisdiction without considering this aspect of the case at all and on this score alone the writ petition was not maintainable.”<br/>(Bold, to give emphasis)<br/> <br/>From this decision, it is evident that in this case the Appellate Division held that the writ petition is not maintainable on two counts— the first one was that the assessment order comes within the purview of section 193 of the Customs Act and, as such, the writ petition filed by respondent before the High Court Division was not at all maintainable. The second was that disputed question of fact was involved in the case. So, writ petition was not maintainable. Thus, by this decision, the Appellate Division clearly set out the principle that assessment made by the Customs Authority can only be challenged by filing an appeal as provided under section 193 of the Customs Act, 1969. The said decision of the Appellate Division is binding upon us.<br/>Similar decision was taken in the unreported judgment dated 23.07.2014 passed in Writ Petitions No. 4406 of 2012, 5466 of 2012 and 5789 of 2012 wherein their lordships decided as under:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“Even after knowing the fact of final assessment made on 04.04.2012 and the same order of final assessment was informed to the Bank Manager by the impugned letters. <u>These Writ Petitions were filed even after knowing about the final assessment. The petitioners did not undertake the appropriate forum as per the provision of the Customs Act, 1969 including section 193 and/or 196 filing of appeal/review before the Appellate Tribunal constituted under the Customs Act as the appropriate forum including, the Commissioner of Customs and/or Customs Appellate Tribunal, instead, the petitioners filed this Writ Petitions, without exhausting the above forum challenging the final assessment even after knowing through the impugned </u>orders as to the final assessment made by the Customs Authority of the imported goods. In such circumstances we are of the view that these Writ Petitions do not merit any further discussion as these Writ Petitions have been filed challenging the <u>encashment of the bank guarantees furnished by the petitioners in order to get the imported goods </u>released which are merely consequences final <u>assessment made by the Customs Authority as per provisions of the Customs Act, 1969, the Valuation Rules, 2000 and also pursuant to the judgments and orders passed by this court on the Writ Petitions in </u>the year of 2005, thus, these writ petitions are premature.<br/>Accordingly, we do not find merit in the Rules.”<br/>(Underlined by us)   </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Now, let us study whether the final assessments made by the customs authority are corum non-judice/without jurisdiction.<br/><br/>It is not the case of the petitioners that the assessments were made by a person not legally empowered/competent to make assessment. Rather, it is the case of the petitioners that the relevant customs authority made assessments violating the provision of rule 5(4) of the Rules. Thus, it appears that the assessment was made by person/persons having legal jurisdiction to make assessment, but assessments were made wrongly, not following rule 5(4) of the Rules.<br/><br/>In this matter, our considered view is that there is a difference between an order passed by a competent person/authority having legal jurisdiction to entertain and decide the matter but which suffers from some irregularity or error (wrong) and an order passed by a person who has no competency or jurisdiction to entertain and decide the matter at all. An order may also be without jurisdiction if it is passed by a person not being lawfully appointed as an authority to pass such order. In the former case, a person’s remedy lies before the appellate forum, if such forum is available under a law and in the later cases, a person may avail writ jurisdiction.<br/><br/>In the light of our above observations, we are of the view that if an assessment order is passed by a person, who has no legal competency/authority to make assessment, in such case ‘a person aggrieved’ may invoke writ jurisdiction. A person may also avail writ jurisdiction if on the face of assessment order, it is apparent that those are malafide or fraudulent. In other cases a person aggrieved by an assessment order has to file an appeal under sections 193/196 of the Act read with rule 13 of the Rules.<br/><br/>In these cases, admittedly, final assessments were made by person/persons who had legal authority/competency to make final assessments. The case of the petitioners, as it transpires from the materials on record, that the assessments were made wrongly and not following the provision of rule 5(4) of the Rules.<br/><br/>In the above admitted scenario, our considered view is that the petitioners’ remedy lies in the appellate forum.<br/><br/>In the facts and circumstances as discussed in the foregoing paragraphs, vis-à-vis the law, we are of the view is that the instant writ petitions are not maintainable and the petitioners’ appropriate remedy is by way of preferring appeals before the appropriate Customs Authority in accordance with the provisions of rule 13 of the Rules read with sections 193/196 of the Act.<br/><br/>Further, we would like to mention that in the affidavit-in-reply, respondent No. 7 Mr. A. H. M. Shahabuddin Nagari himself admitted that he did not get any information regarding price anywhere by different searches of sugar price, raw sugar price and price of sugar from Brazil and so, wrote “Not available.” He further admitted that the Customs House, Chittagong had full authority to ignore the price supplied the office of respondent No. 7. He also admitted that he supplied the highest and lowest values to the Chittagong Customs House on the basis of 100 bills of entry of sugar imported from Brazil, India, Guatemala and some bills of entry from Thailand. Therefore, it is evident from the affidavit-in-reply of respondent No. 7 that he has not supplied the value at which the sugar of different origins had been assessed by the Customs Authorities at the relevant time. Rather, he supplied the values mentioned in the bills of entry by the importers. In the affidavit-in-reply, respondent No. 2 also clearly stated that respondent No. 7 has not discharged his function duly and whimsically supplied data relating to values of sugar (Annexures-C and D) prepared on the basis of disputed invoices supplied by the petitioners.

The law has provided death sentence for some offences. In the present case the offence committed by this accused-appellant Rakibor @ Okibor is so heinous and barbaric in nature that the only punishment for this offence can be the death penalty.

So as regards the accused-appellant Rakibor @ Okibor it appears that there is not only the own confessional statement of this accused-appellant but there are other evidence also lending corroboration to this confessional statement and all these have proved the charge against this accused-appellant Rakibor @ Okibar beyond all reasonable doubt. Considering this extra-judicial confessional statement of accused Helal, the fact of recovery of incriminating articles from his hut and the judicial confessional statement of accused Helal both the Adalat and the High Court Division found this accused-appellant Helal guilty of the offence of commission of rape on victim Morsheda. The High Court Division, however, found that there was no cogent evidence on record to prove that this accused Helal took part in the murder of victim Morsheda and, therefore, the High Court Division converted the conviction of this accused-appellant under section 6(4) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain, 1995 to one under section 6(3) of the same Ain. . . .

Her ‘pajama’ was torn and pulled down to her knees and her ‘kamij’ was raised upto her breasts. The father of the deceased Md. Abdul Jabbar lodged the F.I.R. with Godagari Police Station. The police then came to the house of the parents of the deceased and sent the dead body for autopsy on the following morning. After completion of postmortem examination, the deceased was buried at about 5.00 P.M. on that day. Shortly thereafter, the local people intercepted a youth-who was attempting to flee to India through the nearby border. He was placed under the custody of the local Chowkidar and upon being interrogated by the local people, he disclosed his name as Helal and confessed that he along with Lalon, Rakibor, Basir, Chhobi, Ripon and Jahangir committed rape on Morsheda and thereafter accused Lalon dealt dagger blows on her throat and abdomen causing her death instantaneously. He was handed over to the local police. On the basis of his statement some incriminating articles were recovered and seized as per seizure list-the exhibit-2. On 09.06.1999 the police arrested accused Rakibor @ Okibor (hereinafter referred to as Rakibor) from Tetolia village under Poba Thana and he too admitted his complicity with the offence. Accused Helal and Rakibor made confessional statements under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the Magistrate, 1st Class on 06.06.1999 and 10.06.1999 respectively. Upon completion of investigation the police submitted charge sheet against 7 accused persons, namely, 1. Lalon @ Lal Mohammad, 2. Chhobi @ Mazharul Islam, 3. Ripon @ Anwar Hossain, 4. Md. Jahangir Alam, 5. Md. Basir @ Basir Uddin, 6. Md. Helal @ Hela Uddin and 7. Rakibor @ Okibor @ Takibor under section 6(4) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain, 1995. Out of the 7 accused persons, 5 remained absconding and accused Rakibor and Helal faced trial. The case was ultimately sent to the Nario-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Bishesh Adalat, Rajshahi (herein after referred to as Adalat) for trial. In this Adalat the case was registered as Nari-O-Shishu Case No.357 of 1999. The Adalat framed charge against all the 7 accused persons under section 6(4) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain, 1995. The said charge was read over and explained to accused Helal and Rakibor-who pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/>The prosecution examined 20 witnesses while the defence examined none. The defence case was a plea of innocence.<br/><br/>Accused Helal and Rakibor were examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. On conclusion of trial the Adalat found accused Helal @ Helal Uddin, Rakibor @ Okibor, Lal Mohammad and Basir @ Basir Uddin guilty of the charge brought against them under section 6(4) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain, 1995 and convicted them thereunder and sentenced them to death by the judgment and order dated 08.08.2004. The other accused persons, namely, Chhobi @ Mazharul Islam, Ripon @ Anwar Hossain and Md. Jahangir Alam were acquitted since the prosecution could not prove the charge levelled against them. The Adalat made a reference under section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to the High Court Division for confirmation of death sentences of the convicted accused Helal @ Helal Uddin, Rakibor @ Okibor @ Takibor, Lal Mohammad @ Lalon (absconding) and Basir @ Basir Uddin (absconding) on the basis of which Death Reference No.112 of 2004 was started.<br/><br/>The convicted accused Helal @ Helal Uddin preferred Criminal Appeal No.2904 of 2004 and Rakibor @ Okibor @ Takibor preferred Jail Appeal No.869 of 2004 against the judgment and order of their conviction and sentence. The High Court Division disposed of the death reference and the above  mentioned criminal appeal and jail appeal together by the impugned judgment and order. The High Court Division confirmed the conviction and sentence of the condemned prisoner Rakibor @ Okibor under section 6(4) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain, 1995 and, therefore, dismissed the Jail Appeal No.869 of 2004. The High Court Division dismissed the Criminal Appeal No.2904 of 2004 also preferred by the condemned prisoner Helal, but modified his conviction and sentence. The High Court Division found accused Helal guilty under section 6(3) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain, 1995 and sentenced him to imprisonment for life modifying the sentence of death as awarded by the Adalat. The High Court Division found that the charge against the other two condemned prisoners Lal Mohammad @ Lalon and Basir @ Basir Uddin had not been proved and, therefore, acquitted them. The High Court Division thus accepted the death reference in part so far it relates to condemned prisoner Rakibor @ Okibor only.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by this judgment and order of the High Court Division the condemned prisoner Rakibor @ Okibor @ Takibor has preferred Criminal Appeal No.2 of 2010 and also a Jail Petition No.14 of 2008. The convicted accused Helal @ Helal Uddin has preferred Criminal Appeal No.76 of 2012.<br/><br/>Mr. Khorshed Alam Khan, the learned Advocate has appeared for the appellants of both the appeals. Mr. Khorshed Alam Khan has made submissions before us to the effect that the accused-appellants were not named in the FIR and there was no eye witness of the alleged occurrence. The learned Advocate has argued that both these appellants have been convicted and sentenced on the basis of their so-called confessional statements only which are not voluntary and true at all. The learned Advocate has stated that both the so-called confessional statements were obtained from the accused-appellants by torturing them inhumanly and that during trial both the appellants made specific allegation that they were tortured mercilessly by police for making such confessional statements which were not voluntary and true at all. The learned Advocate has contended that the Adalat and the High Court Division did not consider at al the specific defence case that these so-called confessional statements were not voluntary and true and consequently arrived at a wrong finding and decision causing great injustice to these appellants. The learned Advocate has made submissions to the effect also that the learned Judges of the High Court Division convicted the accused-appellants relying upon the so-called extra judicial confessional statement of accused Helal as corroborative evidence although such extra judicial confession is a very weak type of evidence and as such it should not have been used as corroborative evidence. The learned Advocate has contended that in this case since there is no other evidence, either direct or circumstantial to corroborate the so-called confessional statements of the accused-appellants the learned Judges of the High Court Division were wrong in treating the alleged extra judicial oral confession of the accused Helal as corroborative evidence inasmuch as such extra judicial confession also is required to be corroborated by other reliable evidence. The learned Advocate has contended that the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division is liable to be set aside. Mr. Khurshid Alam Khan, the learned Advocate has made submissions to the effect also that the accused-appellant Rakibor @ Okibor is a young man of 27 years and he is in condemned cell for more than 10 years and thus having suffered the mental agony of death within the death cell for long 10 years he may now be showed some mercy and his sentence of death may be commuted to imprisonment for life for the ends of justice.<br/><br/>Mr. Masud Hasan Chowdhury, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the State respondent has made submissions supporting of the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division.  <br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates of both the sides and gone through the impugned judgment of the High Court Division, that of the Adalat and also the evidence on record.<br/><br/>The accused-appellant Rakibor @ Okibor and Helal @ Helal Uddin have been convicted and sentenced on the basis of their own confes-sional statements. Both these confessional statements have been reproduced in the impugned judgment of the High Court Division. In both the confessional statements there is a vivid description of the incident of rape committed on the victim Morsheda and also of her murder by the accused persons. In the confessional statements of accused Rakibor @ Okibor the confessing accused has clearly implicated himself in the commission of rape and also murder of Morsheda. He has given a detailed account of the role that he played in commission of those offences. As per his own confession he committed rape on the deceased Morsheda and thereafter he also took part in the murder by pressing legs of the deceased. This confessional statement proves the presence and participation of accused Rakibor @ Okibor both in the commission of rape and murder of deceased Morsheda. This confession of accused Rakibor is corroborated by the confession made by the other accused-appellant Helal. Though it has been argued that the confessional statement of accused Helal recorded under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure being exculpatory, is not admissible in evidence but considering the facts and circumstances we do not accept this argument. There is sufficient evidence on record to prove that immediate after apprehension of the accused Helal by the local people he made extra-judicial confessional statement before so many persons stating that he himself along with other accused persons including accused Rakibor @ Okibor raped victim Morsheda and thereafter murdered her. There are sufficient evidence also to prove that as per this confessional statement of accused Helal some incriminating articles, namely, bloodstained curtain, quilt cover, spade and bamboo rod were recovered from the dwelling hut of accused Helal. The extra-judicial confessional statement of accused Helal followed by recovery of incriminating articles from his dwelling hut not only are sufficient to find accused Helal guilty of the charge framed against him, but this extra judicial confessional statement has strongly corroborated also the confessional statement of the other accused Rakibor @ Okibor. Before this Division  it has been argued from the side of the accused-appellants that these confessional statements of these two accused-appellants are not voluntary and true, rather they were obtained by police torture, but the learned Advocate for the accused-appellants could not point out anything before us to substantiate this argument. The learned magistrates-who recorded these confessional statements of these 2 accused-appellants have been examined by the prosecution as P.W.11 and P.W.14 and both of them have deposed to the effect that they recorded these confessional statements of these accused-appellants in compliance with all the mandatory provisions of law and being satisfied that those confessional statements were being made voluntarily. Both the Adalat and the High Court Division, on consideration of all aspects, found these confessional statements of these accused-appellants voluntary and true. We do not find anything to differ with these concurrent findings and decision of the courts below as to voluntariness and truth of the confessional statements of these two accused-appellants.<br/><br/>It is an established principle of law that confessional statements, if voluntary and true, can be the sole basis of conviction of the maker of it. In the present case the confessional statement of accused-appellant Rakibor @ Okibor alone is sufficient for finding him guilty of the charge levelled against him. The confessional statement of accused-appellant Rakibor @ Okibor has been well corroborated also by the extra judicial confessional statements of the other accused Helal and also by the fact that as per that confessional statements of accused Helal some incriminating articles were recovered from the dwelling hut of confessing accused Helal. So as regards the accused-appellant Rakibor @ Okibor it appears that there is not only the own confessional statement of this accused-appellant but there are other evidence also lending corroboration to this confessional statement and all these have proved the charge against this accused-appellant Rakibor @ Okibar beyond all reasonable doubt.<br/><br/>The confessional statement of accused Helal recorded under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been argued to be exculpatory in nature as apparently, in this confessional statement he has made an attempt to absolve himself from the offence. But in this confessional statement he has not denied his presence at the place of occurrence and stated also that after commission of the offence the other accused persons took shelter in his hut and according to this confessional statement some incriminating articles, namely, bloodstained curtain, quilt cover, spade and bamboo rod were recovered form his hut. Over and above there are sufficient evidence on record to prove that soon after the occurrence while he was trying to flee away to India he was caught by the villagers and at that time he made extra-judicial confession in presence of many persons stating that he himself and other accused persons including accused-appellant Rakibor @ Okibor committed rape on the victim Morsheda and thereafter they murdered her. This extra-judicial confessional statement of accused Helal followed by recovery of incriminating articles from his hut alone are sufficient to find him guilty of the charge levelled against him. This extra-judicial confessional statement of accused Helal and the recovery of incriminating articles from his hut prove that in his judicial confessional statement accused Helal intentionally suppressed the fact of his involvement in the commission of rape and murder of Morsheda to absolve himself from punishment. Considering this extra-judicial confessional statement of accused Helal, the fact of recovery of incriminating articles from his hut and the judicial confessional statement of accused Helal both the Adalat and the High Court Division found this accused-appellant Helal guilty of the offence of commission of rape on victim Morsheda. The High Court Division, however, found that there was no cogent evidence on record to prove that this accused Helal took part in the murder of victim Morsheda and, therefore, the High Court Division converted the conviction of this accused-appellant under section 6(4) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain, 1995 to one under section 6(3) of the same Ain.<br/><br/>Mr. Khorshed Alam Khan, the learned Advocate for the accused-appellants has made submissions to the effect also that the condemned accused-appellant is a young man of 27 years only and he is being detained in the condemned cell for about 10 years and that considering this fact as an extenuating circumstances his death sentence may be now commuted to imprisonment of life for the ends of justice. But considering the very nature of the offence which is heinous, ghastly and barbaric act of rape and murder committed upon a 16 years old girl we are of the opinion that justice will be denied if the death sentence of the accused-appellant Rakibor @ Okibor is commuted to imprisonment for life. The law has provided death sentence for some offences. In the present case the offence committed by this accused-appellant Rakibor @ Okibor is so heinous and barbaric in nature that the only punishment for this offence can be the death penalty. To secure the ends of justice this type of offenders must be awarded the highest punishment provided by law, any leniency, if shown to this type of offenders, will cause miscarriage of justice.<br/><br/>We, therefore, dismiss both the appeals and also the Jail Petition No.14 of 2008 filed by the accused-appellant Md. Rakibor @ Okibor.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

The plaintiff has no prima-facie case and the injunction application is misconceived and uncalled for.<br/><br/>The learned Joint District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Kishoregonj after hearing the parties by his order dated 7.8.2014 granted temporary injunction  restraining  the defendant No.2 from  doing any activities in the Managing Committee dated 25.02.2014 of Khas Howla Government Primary School, Bhairab, Kishoregonj till disposal of the suit.<br/><br/>The defendants took an appeal being Misc. Appeal No.76 of 2014 thereform. The appellate Court after hearing by the impugned  judgment and order dated  24.9.2014  reversed the order dated 7.8.2014 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Kishoregonj.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the aforesaid impugned judgment and order dated 24.9.2014, the petitioner moved this Court and obtained the present Rule.<br/><br/>Mr. Zainul Abedin, the learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff-petitioner submits that the learned Judge of the appellate Court below misconceived the facts of the case as well as the order of the learned Joint District Judge  and wrongly set aside the same. He next in the course of his argument after placing the relevant law submits that  the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education published Rules and Regulations vide circular No.38.008. 035. 00.00.007.2012-688 dated 15.11.12 for forming committee, Ad-hoc Committee, etc. as to Govt. Registered and Community Primary School where specifically mentioned in serial Nos.1.2/1.3 that the Education Enthusiastic male and female member must be selected by the Headmaster of the School concern in consultation with the local Member of Parliament and the Headmaster of Khas Howla Govt. Primary School selected 3(three) male members  including the plaintiff and 3(three) females for Education Enthusiastic persons and sent the letter to the Member of Parliament, 167, Kishoregonj-6 for his consent on 22.01.2014 as per provisions of  Rules and Regulations inserted in the circular No. 38.008.035.00.00.007.2012-688 dated 15.11.12 of the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education and the local Member of Parliament has given his kind consent on 18.02.2014 nominating the plaintiff-petitioner as Education Enthusiastic male member for the Managing Committee. He further submits that  the earlier Managing Committee of Khas Howla Govt. Primary School took resolution on 20.01.2014 on various matters including the selection of Education Enthusiastic male and female members for the next committee where the plaintiff and defendant No.2 also present there and sitting Managing Committee selected the plaintiff as Education Enthusiastic Male No.1 and one Fatema Begum as Education Enthusiastic Female No.1 and the defendant No.2 is also one of the signatory of that  Resolution  and it is evident that the defendant- opposite party No.2 sent a letter to the Local Member of Parliament without mentioning any date and one Rashida Begum also sent a letter to the Local Member of Parliament,  who has given his signature  on the petition without giving any date, but   the defendant No.2 at his own motion  mentioned a date as being 13.02.2014 which appears to be manufactured and the defendant No. 2 also formed a Managing Committee showing him a President by  violating the Rules of the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education and the same has not yet been effected, but the appellate Court below without considering all these vital aspects of the case from a correct angle allowed the appeal and set-aside the order of injunction  arbitrarily and the same has occasioned failure of justice.<br/><br/>Mr. Zainul Abedin further submits that the trial court on  considering the facts of the case and the case made out by the plaintiff petitioner that the Headmaster of Khas Hawla Govt. Primary School declared an election schedule on 25.12.2013 as per the circular No. 38.008.035.00.00.007.2012-688 dated 15.11.2012 of the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education for forming Managing Committee of the said School fixing the date for election on 23.02.2014,  but the opposite party No.2 arranged a general meeting where one Md. Khalil Mia presided over the meeting among the persons who are not voters for the election of forming Managing Committee of the school and they  took a illegal  Resolution selecting  the defendant-opposite party No.2 as an Education Enthusiastic Male Member among others and appointing  him president of  the Managing Committee of Khas Howla Government Primary School, Bhairab, Kishoregonj  2014-2016 without any vote before the scheduled date of the vote i.e. on 23.02.2014 factually found prima facie  case,  balance of convenience and inconvenience is in favour of the plaintiff, but  the court of appeal below  without properly applying its judicial mind into the facts and circumstances of the case and law bearing on the subject most illegally held that balance of convenience and inconvenience is not in favour of the plaintiff, rather it is well in favour of the defendants and the same has occasioned failure of justice.<br/><br/>Finally, Mr. Zainul Abedin, candidly   upon referring the plaint of the suit has assailed the impugned judgment on the ground that the District Judge, Kishoregonj  or Additional District Judge, Kishoregonj had no  jurisdiction  to entertain and decide the appeal inasmuch as  sub-section (1) of section 21 of the Civil Courts Act invests a District Judge with the Jurisdiction to entertain and hear appeals in which it lays down that an appeal from a decree or  order of a subordinate Judge shall lie to the District Judge where the value of the original suit in which or in proceedings arising out of which the decree or order was made does not exceed Five Lac Taka and the suit out of which the above Miscellaneous Appeal arose  was admittedly valued at Tk. 5,50,000/= (Five Lac fifty thousand)  which exceeds the pecuniary limit of the District Judge and consequently the appeal would have filed  to this Court and not to the District Judge, but the District Judge, Kishoregonj wrongly assumed jurisdiction, although the law has not authorised the District Judge to entertain and hear the appeal valued beyond Tk. 5,50,000/=, in view of this legal position the appeal was entertained by the District Judge, Kishoregonj and heard by the Additional District Judge,  Kishoregonj without jurisdiction. Mr. Zainul Abedin to fortify his last  branch of argument   has relied on the decision reported in 59 DLR 470.<br/><br/>Mr. Syed Haider Ali, the learned Advocate appearing for the opposite party Nos.2-4 and 6-10, on the other hand, supports the impugned judgment and contends that the learned Additional District Judge was perfectly justified in setting aside the order of the trial Court dated 7.8.2014 on the clear finding that the trial Court below without considering the facts of the case and the case made out by the defendants most illegally held  that prima facie case, balance of convenience and inconvenience is in favour of the plaintiff-petitioner, though in the facts and circumstance of the case, the balance of convenience and inconvenience is well in favour of the defendants. He further submits that  the appellate court below  after a detailed discussion of the attending circums-tances borne out by records rightly  held that the entire proceeding of election of the Managing Committee of the Khas Hawla Govt. Primary School was made  in accordance of law and also within the knowledge of the Hon’ble Member of the Parliament and the decision taken by the Managing Committee of the Khas Hawla Govt. Primary School  on 25.02..2014 has been acted upon  and therefore, the plaintiff does not have any  prima facie case for injunction inasmuch as  balance of convenience and inconvenience is infavour of the defendants and the plaintiff shall not suffer any irreparable loss and injury and accordingly, the plaintiff is not entitled to get an order of  temporary injunction as sought for. Finally,  Mr. Syed Haider Ali relying on a decision reported in 13 BLD 648 submits that the jurisdictional defect is not itself a ground for interference in revision unless it has resulted in an error in the decision occasioning a failure of justice.<br/><br/>Now, to deal with the contentions raised by the parties, I feel it necessary to decide first whether the District Judge, Kishoregonj acted in excess of jurisdiction in entertaining the Misc. Appeal. For proper appreciation of this question in its true prospective it will be useful to look to section 21 of the Civil Courts Act (amended Act, 2001)   which reads as follows: <br/>  </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Sec.-21:  Appeal from Joint District Judge, etc.—1) Save as aforesaid, an appeal from a decree or order of a (Joint District) Judge shall lie-</div><ul><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">to the District Judge where the value of the original suit in which or in any proceeding arising out of which the decree or order was made did not exceed (five lac Taka) and</li><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">to the High Court Division in any other case.</li></ul><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(2) Save as aforesaid, an appeal from a decree or order of a (Senior Assistant Judge or an Assistant Judge) shall lie to the District Judge.<br/>(3) Where the function of receiving any appeals which lie to the District Judge under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) has been assigned to an (Additional District) Judge, the appeals may be preferred to the (Additional District) Judge.<br/>(4) The High Court Division may, with the previous sanction of the Government, direct, by notification in the official Gazette, that appeals lying to the District Judge under sub-section (2) from all or any of the decrees or orders of any (Senior Assistant Judge or an Assistant Judge), shall be preferred to the Court of such (Joint District) Judge as may be mentioned in the notification, and the appeals shall thereupon be preferred accordingly.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">From a combined reading of sub-section (1), (2), (3) and (4) of section of section 21 of the Civil Courts Act ( as amended Act, 2001), it is manifestly clear  that sub-section (1) of section 21 of the Civil Courts Act invests a District Judge with the Jurisdiction to entertain and hear appeals. It lays down that an appeal from a decree or  order of a  Joint District  Judge shall lie to the District Judge where the value of the original suit in which or in proceedings arising out of which the decree or order was made does not exceed Tk. 5,50,000/=  and to the High Court Division in any other case.<br/><br/>In this case the suit out of which the above Miscellaneous Appeal arose  was admittedly valued at Tk. 5,50,000/= (Five Lac fifty thousand),    which exceeds the pecuniary limit of the District Judge and consequently the appeal would have filed to this Court and not to the District Judge, but the District Judge, Kishoregonj  wrongly assumed jurisdiction and Additional District Judge decided the appeal. When the law has not authorised the District Judge to entertain and hear the appeal valued beyond Tk. 5,50,000/=, the appeal was wholly incompetent. The legal position thus is that the appeal was entertained by the District Judge, Kishoregonj and heard by the Additional District Judge, Kishoregonj without jurisdiction.<br/><br/>On the face of Section 21 of the Civil Courts Act, Mr. Syed Haider Ali, learned Advocate for the opposite-party Nos.2-4 and 6-10 found it difficult to contend that the appeal before the District Judge, Kishoregonj was competent. He has, however, urged that the petitioner participated in the appellate proceeding without raising any objection as to the jurisdiction of that Court and on that count the impugned judgment and order cannot  be rendered null, and void. He has also urged that the jurisdictional defect is not itself a ground for interference in revision unless it has resulted in an error in the decision occasioning a failure of justice.<br/><br/>In the case of Kiran Singh and others V. Chaman Paswan and others reported in , A.I.R 1954 (S.C) 340, it was held  as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“It is a fundamental principle well established that a decree passed by a Court without jurisdiction is a nullity, and that its invalidity could be set up whenever and wherever it is sought to be enforced or relied upon, even at the stage of execution and even in collateral proceedings. A defect of jurisdiction, whether it is pecuniary or territorial, or whether it is in respect of the subject matter of the action, strikes at the very authority of the court to pass any decree, and such a defect cannot be cured even by consent of parties.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Similar view was taken in  the case of Ledgard V. Bull, 13 I.A., 144. In that case a suit was brought in the Court of a subordinate Judge who had no competence to try it.  By consent of parties the same was transferred to the Court of District Judge for convenience of trial, The privy Council held that the court in which the suit was originally brought was lacking in inherent jurisdiction in the sense that it was incompetent to try it and whatsoever happened subsequently was null and void because consent of parties could not  operate to confer jurisdiction on a Court which was not competent to try the suit. In course of the judgment their Lordships made the following observations.<br/><br/>The same principle was re-iterated by the Privy Council in the case of Meenakshi Naidoo V. Subramaniya Sastri, 14 I.A., 160.<br/><br/>In the case of Md. Mahmudul Haque V. Md. Shamsul Alam, 36 DLR. (AD) 179, their lordships held that when the law has conferred jurisdiction expressly, no amount of consent by the parties can invest a Court with jurisdiction which is not given by law.<br/><br/>This principle was also followed in the case of Kanai Lal Ghose V. Jatindra Nath Chandra reported in A.I.R 1918 Cal. 925 where an appeal was filed before the district Judge who had no jurisdiction to entertain and hear the appeal but he heard the same without any objection from the parties.<br/><br/>In the case of Hiralal Patni V. Sree Kali Nath, A.I.R. 1962 (S.C) 199 the Supreme Court of India pointed out that “competence of a Court to try a case, whether such competence is with regard to the nature of the subject matter or to its pecuniary  jurisdiction, goes  to the very root of the jurisdiction, and where it is lacking, it is a case of inherent lack of jurisdiction.”<br/><br/>It is thus firmly established that where an order or judgment is passed by a Court which lacked inherent jurisdiction in the sense that it had no competence to entertain and hear the case, the order is a nullity and no amount of consent of the parties or mere mistake of the parties can confer validity to the same.<br/><br/>True it is that the petitioner went for the hearing of the appeal without raising any objection as to the pecuniary jurisdiction of the District Judge but the objection in this case being apparent on the face of the Memo, of appeal and there being an inherent incompetence in the District Judge to even entertain the appeal, an omission on the part of the petitioner to take exception to his jurisdiction could not legalise the acts of the District Judge. The submission of Mr. Syed Haider Ali has, therefore, no foundation.<br/><br/>Jurisdiction of a Court goes to the very root of the matter brought before it, and if the court got no jurisdiction, everything shall fall through. Mr. Syed Haider Ali is not correct in submitting that the court’s jurisdiction is a mere technicality, which is not itself a ground for interference in revision unless it has resulted in an error in the decision occasioning a failure of justice.  The District Judge  or Additional District Judge  having no jurisdiction over the matter,  the impugned judgment passed in Miscellaneous Appeal is void.<br/><br/>Since the impugned judgment is to be  null and void on the ground of court’s jurisdiction   it is needless to go into the second point. But,  in the facts and circumstance of the case I think it will be  wise to decide that whether the learned judge of the appellate court below was justified in holding that the plaintiff does not have any prima facie case for injunction inasmuch as balance of convenience and inconvenience is in favour of the defendants.<br/>On scrutiny of the record, it appears that the plaintiff petitioner sought for temporary injunction restraining  the defendant No.2 from  performing any activities in the Managing Committee of Khas Howla Government Primary School, Bhairab, Kishoregonj till disposal of the suit  on the allegation that  the defendant No. 2 was not selected as Education Enthusiastic male member  of   the Managing Committee of Khas Howla Government Primary School, Bhairab, Kishoregonj 2014-2016 in accordance with the  procedure of Government Circular vide its Memo No.38.008.035.00.007.2012-688 dated 15.9.12 of Primary and Mass Education Ministry, school-2. The plaintiff petitioner contends that the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education published Rules and Regulations vide circular No.38.008.035.00.00.007.2012-688 dated 15.11.12 for forming committee, Ad-hoc Committee, etc. as to Govt. Registered and Community Primary School where specifically mentioned in serial Nos.1.2/1.3 that the Education Enthusiastic male and female member must be selected by the Headmaster of the School concern in consultation with the local Member of Parliament and the Headmaster of Khas Howla Govt. Primary School selected 3(three) male members  including the plaintiff and 3(three) females for Education Enthusiastic persons and sent the letter to the Member of Parliament, 167, Kishoregonj-6 for his consent on 22.01.2014 as per provisions of  Rules and Regulations inserted in the circular No. 38.008.035.00.00.007.2012-688 dated 15.11.12 of the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education and the local Member of Parliament has given his kind consent on 18.02.2014 nominating the plaintiff-petitioner as Education Enthusiastic male member for the Managing Committee of the school.<br/><br/>The defendant No. 2 contended that after exhausting all the  formalities in accordance with law the Managing Committee of Khas Howla Government Primary School, Bhairab, Kishoregonj by its regulation dated 25.02.2014 selected the defendant No. 2 as Education Enthusiastic male member  and appointed him president of  the Managing Committee of Khas Howla Government Primary School, Bhairab, Kishoregonj  2014-2016 and as such question of granting injunction does not arise at all.<br/><br/>The trial Court factually found that the  plaintiff has a good prima facie case for injunction and  that   balance of convenience and inconvenience is in-favour of the plaintiff and granted temporary injunction restraining the defendant No. 2 from doing any activities in the Managing Committee of Khas Howla Government Primary School, Bhairab, Kishoregonj  formed by regulation dated 25.02.2014 of the Managing Committee.<br/>On a close perusal of the impugned judgment, it appears that the learned Additional District judge laid unnecessary stress upon certain disputed facts such as proper recomm-endation of the local Parliament  Member  to the plaintiff petitioner or defendant No. 2  as Education Enthusiastic Male member. Both the plaintiff and defendant No. 2 are claiming upon referring their documents that the local Hon’ble Parliament  Member  recommended them as Education Enthusiastic Male member for Managing Committee of Khas Howla Government Primary School. To decide the truth of the matter evidence is necessary which can be available only in course of trial of the suit.<br/>On an overall consideration of the facts, circumstance of the case  and the materials on record, I am of the opinion  that the plaintiff-petitioner  has a good prima-facie case for temporary injunction inasmuch as   the balance of convenience and inconvenience is clearly   in favour of the plaintiff and the plaintiff shall suffer irreparable loss and injury, if injunction is not granted, as prayed for. The Appellate Court misconceived the facts of the case and the order of the learned Assistant Judge and wrongly set aside the same on the finding that the balance of convenience and inconvenience is  in favour of the defendants. Therefore,   I find no difficulty whatever in holding that, the impugned judgment of the  appellate court is a product of non application of judicial mind and suffers from patent illegality. To avoid any prejudice to the defendants in the suit, it is better to refrain from making any further observation. <br/><br/>Here it may be mentioned that the case relied upon by the defendant-opposite parties  have also no manner of application in the facts and circumstance of the case inasmuch as the facts of the instant case are quite distinguishable from the facts of the cited  case.<br/><br/>In view of my discussions made in the forgoing paragraphs it is by now clear  that the instant Rule must succeed.<br/><br/>In the result, the Rule is made absolute without any order as to costs. The impugned judgment and order dated 24.9.2014 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Kishoregonj in Miscellaneous Appeal No.76 of 2014 is set-aside and that the order dated 7.8.2014 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Kishoregonj in Other Class Suit No.36 of 2014 granting temporary injunction is restored.<br/>However, in the facts and circumstance of the case the trial Court concerned is directed to hear and dispose of the suit as early as possible preferably within 4(four) months from the date of receipt of this judgment without giving any adjournment to any of the parties.<br/><br/>Let a copy of this judgment be communicated to the Courts concerned at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
