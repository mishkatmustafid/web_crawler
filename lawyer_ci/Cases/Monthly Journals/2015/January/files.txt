Having gone through the news report, we found that very derogatory remarks were made by Mr. Arif Ahmed, Upazila Education Officer, Sadar Upazila, Kurigram to the Headmistress of Attaram Bishawar Government Primary School.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Salahuddin Dolon, learned Advocate of this Court, who was present at the relevant time in the Court filed an application for taking appropriate action against the Upazila Education Officer. The learned Advocate became the petitioner in public interest. Consequently, the swearing of affidavit on the application was dispensed with and the office was directed to register the application as a Writ Petition. After that, we issued a Rule Nisi calling upon the respondents to show cause as to why respondent No. 1 should not be directed to take appropriate action against respondent No. 3 for uttering highly derogatory remarks against the Headmistress of the School as stated in the news item.<br/><br/>The news item published in ‘The Daily Samakal’ on 26.6.2009 at page 9 is transcribed from Bangla to English as under:</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><br/><em>In an open meeting, the Upazila Primary Education Officer scolded the Headmistress of a Primary School by uttering the word, ‘prostitute’. She could not sustain the dishonour and became senseless whereupon the District Primary Education Officer himself took her to Sadar Hospital. In protest, all the teachers boycotted that meeting. It was learnt that last Friday while a meeting was in progress at noon, the Upazila Education Officer directed all female teachers to attend school wearing henceforth a scarf. When fifty female teachers present there protested, the Education Officer, Arif Ahmed, pointing at the Headmistress, Ms. Sultana Arjuman Banu of Athmaram Bisheswas Government Primary School, declared her uncultured</em> (Amf¨)| <em>He further said, “If a prostitute is called a prostitute, she looks at the sky, on the other hand, when a lady is called a prostitute, she looks down upon the ground. In protest of the objectionable remarks, all the teachers left the meeting. While speaking to the newspaper correspondent, the Headmistress said in choked voice that she received prizes as the best teacher of the district 4 (four) times but she did never hear such objectionable remarks in nineteen years of her career as a teacher. The teachers present stated that the Upazila   Education Officer was addicted to drugs. They further alleged the Upazila Education Officer indulged in rampant corruption in posting and transfer of teachers through brokers.</em><br/><em>When the newspaper correspondent talked</em><em> about the matter to the Upazila Education Officer he admitted what happened. He further told the newspaper correspondent, “You can write whatever you like.” The District Education Officer when heard about the occurrence stated that action was being taken against the Upazila Education Officer.  </em> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>After service of notice, an enquiry was conducted by the Deputy Director of the Department of Primary Education. The Deputy Director submitted a report on 27.9.2009 stating that the news item as stated in The      Daily Samakal on 26.6.2009 was genuine.  The Deputy Director, however, found that the action of the Upazila Education Officer was not intentional and that the action was a mistake.  As soon as the report came to our notice we directed the Deputy Director to appear in person before this Court to explain away his position regarding his report dated 28.2.2010.<br/><br/>In obedience to the Court’s order the Deputy Director appeared in person on 11.2.2010 and stated that he did not do any wrong intentionally. We were not satisfied with the explanation. Therefore, on 11.2.2010 we directed the Deputy Director to submit a written explanation about his report. On that date we also directed the victim to appear in person before this Court on 28.2.2010. On that date the Deputy Director, the victim Sultana Arjuma Haque and the Upazila Education Officer appeared in person. The Deputy Director also submitted a written explanation tendering unqualified apology for the recommendation made in his report. The victim stated before this Court that she became senseless on hearing the derogatory remarks made to her by respondent No.3. She was admitted to the hospital and had to stay there for seven days. She then stated that the occurrence took place on 25.6.2009 as reported in “The Daily Samokal” on 26.6.2009. The victim started crying in the Court Room when we asked her about the occurrence of 25.6.2009. In open Court, respondent No. 3 tendered unqualified apology with folded hands to the victim who stated that she had accepted the apology and that she had forgiven respondent No. 3.<br/><br/>On 4.3.2010, the Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST) through its Deputy Director (Legal Aid) Ms. Farida Yeasmin filed an application for addition of party. The application was allowed and the Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust was added as co-petitioner No. 2.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Salahuddin Dolon, learned Advocate appearing in person, submits that the derogatory remarks made by respondent No. 3 is highly objectionable and that appropriate punitive action should be taken against him. He further submits that the Court should frame guidelines so that the women working in different Government organizations are not harassed.<br/><br/>Ms. Sara Hossain, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the co-petitioner No. 2, submits that the impugned action is a form of sexual harassment and clear instance of gender based discrimination perpetrated by a state official. She further submits that the impugned action is an example of attempts to impose dress codes on women and such attempts amount to violation of fundamental rights of women as enshrined in the Constitution. She then submits that attempts to impose dress code constitutes a violation of women’s right to personal liberty to freedom of expression and to movement and also to freedom of religion as guaranteed by the Constitution. He lastly submits that specific measures should to be undertaken by the state to implement its obligations to enforce the constitutionally guaranteed rights to prohibit gender discrimination and ensure equality of opportunity in public employment, as well as freedom of expression.<br/><br/>We have perused the application, the affidavit filed by respondent No. 3 tendering unqualified apology and written explanation submitted by the Deputy Director, Primary Education. Respondent No. 3, Upazila Education Officer, stated that the occurrence as alleged in the news item published in ‘The Daily Samokal’ was true. Consequently, when the victim appeared before this Court, respondent No. 3 tendered unqualified apology to her with folded hands. The victim, however, accepted the unqualified apology and stated that she had forgiven respondent No. 3. How an educated man of the status of a Thana Education officer could utter the word “বেশ্যা” (prostitute) to a Headmistress of a Government Primary School is not comprehensible. It is the personal choice of a woman to wear veil or to cover her head. Any such attempt to control a woman’s movement and expression- and further­ in this case threatening the teacher concerned for her failure to do so- is clearly a violation of her right to personal liberty.<br/><br/>In Bangladesh there has been no uniform practice of veiling or head covering among women. However, in recent years, there have seen such attempts to forcibly impose dress codes not only by private persons and extremist political organizations, claiming to act on the basis of religion, but also by persons in authority, including those in public office.<br/><br/>In the absence of any legal sanction, attempts to coerce or impose a dress code on women clearly amounts to a form of sexual harassment. To the extent the derogatory term used against the teacher was sexually coloured and it also targeted her as a woman by requiring her to cover her head, a requirement which was not made to any other male teacher in the school and such action also amounts to sexual harassment and to a form of gender discrimination.<br/><br/>As Article 29 occurring in chapter III of Constitution states, amongst others, that there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in respect of employment or office in the service of the Republic and that no citizen shall, on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth, be illegible for, or discriminated against, in respect of any employment or office in the service of the Republic. Sub-article (2) of Article 28 specifically provides that women should have equal rights with men in all spheres of the State and of public life. Sub-article (4) of Article 28 provides that nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making special provision in favour of women or children or for the advancement of any backward section of citizens.<br/><br/>Article 39 of the Constitution guarantees freedom of thought, conscience and expression. Freedom of expression ranges from the articulation of words and images to actions and lifestyle choices, including choices around one’s manner of dress and behaviour. Subjecting a woman to harassment due on account of her failure to cover her head, is a discriminatory act, which is a violation of equality clause of the Constitution and inconsistent with international standards.<br/><br/>Arbitrary and intrusive gender-based codes for acceptable demeanour and dress also violate the rights to privacy and to free expression protected under international law, as well as the right of women to protection from violence. These obligations of the state have been set out in reports of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, which are summarized below:<br/><br/>As a party to the<u> International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), </u>Bangladesh has agreed to bar interference with the right to privacy (Article 17) and protects freedom of expression (Article 19). Bangladesh has the obligation to respect and ensure these rights, and to do so in a non-discriminatory manner, as set froth in Article 2 of the treaty.<br/><br/>Many international legal instruments dealing with human rights include the protection of women from violence in their provisions. The <u>Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in article 1,</u> states that “all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights”. Article 2 provides that “everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status”. Article 3 provides that “everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.” Article 5 provides that “no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” The nondiscrimination clause in Article 2, taken together with Articles 3 and 5, means that any form of violence against women which can be construed as a threat to her life, liberty or dignity or security of person or which constitutes torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is not in keeping with the Universal Declaration and is therefore a violation of the international obligations of Member States.<br/><br/>Article 3 of the <u>International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights</u> guarantees the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all rights set forth in that Covenant and many of the substantive rights set out in the Covenant cannot be enjoyed by women if gender-based violence is widespread. For example, article 7 of the International Covenant on Economic and Social Rights ensures the right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work. This, by implication, entails that women must be free of violence and harassment at the workplace.<br/><br/><u>General recommendation No. 19, of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Violence against Women,</u> Eleventh session, General recommendation 19 (CEDAW/C/ 1992/ L.1/Add.15./formulated in 1992, deals entirely with violence against women and explicitly states that   gender-based violence is a form of discrimination which seriously inhibits a woman’s ability to enjoy rights and freedoms on a basis of equality with men and asks that State parties have regard to this when reviewing their laws and policies. The recommendation further states that when reporting under the Convention States parties should take this into consideration. It also argues that the definition of “discrimination” in article 1 of the Convention includes gender-based violence, which is in turn defined in recommendation 19 as “violence directed against a woman because she is a woman or which affects women disproportionately. It includes physical, mental, or sexual harm or suffering, threats of such acts, coercion and other deprivations of liberty.”<br/><br/>General recommendation 19 also deals with specific articles of the Convention and how they relate to violence against women. The specific areas discussed include traditional attitudes, customs and practices (arts. 2 (f) 5 and 10 (c), violence and equality in employment (art. 11), and rural women (art. 14).<br/><br/><u>General recommendation 19</u> argues that certain <strong><em>traditions and customs </em></strong>and practices whereby women are regarded as subordinate or as having stereotyped roles perpetuate various practices, including violence and coercion, and that such prejudices and beliefs may be used to justify gender-based violence as a form of protection or control of women, as a result of which women are deprived of the equal enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms.<br/><br/>On the question of <strong><em>employment</em></strong>, <u>General recommendation 19 </u>states that gender specific violence such as sexual harassment in the workplace can seriously impair equality in employment. The General recommendation also recognizes that rural women are at special risk of violence because of the persistence of traditional attitudes in many rural communities and it imposes an obligation on States to ensure that services for victims of violence are accessible to rural women. Where necessary, special services should be provided for isolated communities. (emphasis is ours)<br/><br/>Our courts will not enforce those Covenants as treaties and conventions, even if ratified by the State, are not part of the <em>corpus juris</em> of the State unless those are incorporated in the municipal legislation. However, the court can look into these conventions and covenants as an aid to interpretation of the provisions of Part III, particularly to determine the rights implicit in the rights like the right to life and the right to liberty, but not enumerated in the Constitution. <em>In the case of H.M. Ershad v. Bangladesh, 2001 BLD (AD) 69,</em> it is held: “The national courts should not ............... straightway ignore the international obligations which a country undertakes. If the domestic laws are not clear enough or there is nothing therein the national courts should draw upon the principles incorporated in the international instruments.” In the case of <em>Apparel Export Promotion Council v. Chopra, AIR 1999 SC 625</em> it is held, “In cases involving violation of human rights, the courts must for ever remain alive to the international instruments and conventions and apply the same to a given case when there is no inconsistency between the international norms and the domestic law occupying the field.”<br/><br/>Article 25 occurring in Part II (Fundamental Principles of State Policy) of the Constitution states, amongst others, that the State shall base its international relations on the principles of respect for international law and the principles enunciated in the United Nations Charter.<br/><br/>As the instant case demonstrates, harassment of women and girls is endemic in public spaces, schools, institutes of higher education and workplaces, both public and private sectors. On 14.5.2009 this Court in the case of <em>Bangladesh National Women Lawyers Association (BNWLA) Vs. Government of Bangladesh and Others, reported in (2009) 14 BLC 694=(2009) 29 BLD (HCD) 415</em> issued guidelines for the prevention of sexual harassment directing the Government to enact legislation to address this issue immediately pending which the guidelines would have the force of law. In accordance with the guidelines on sexual harassment laid down by this Court in its judgment dated 14.5.2009 in <em>Bangladesh National Women Lawyers Association (BNWLA) </em>Vs. <em>Government of Bangladesh and Others,</em> sexual harassment includes;</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">4(i) (c) Sexually coloured verbal repress-entation;<br/>4(1) (f) Sexually coloured remark or gesture. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Rule 2 of the Government Servants (Discipline and Appeals) Rules 1985 defines “misconduct” as conduct prejudicial to good order or service discipline or contrary to any provision of the Government Servants (Conduct) Rules, 1979 or unbecoming of an officer or gentleman.<br/><br/>Rule 27A. Conduct towards female colleagues-No Government servant shall use any language or behave with his female colleagues in any manner which is improper and goes against the official decorum and dignity of female colleagues. This Rule 27 is to be read with the definition of sexual harassment given in Guideline 4 of the Guidelines formulated by this Court in the case of <em>Bangladesh Jatiya Mahila Ainjibi Samity</em> Vs. <em>Government of Bangladesh, reported in  (2009) 14 BLC 694=(2009) 29 BLD (HCD) 415 </em>in case of Government servants In general, the educational institutions both in public and private sectors shall follow the guidelines formulated in the case of <em>Bangladesh Jatiya Mahila Ainjibi Samity Vs. Government of Bangladesh </em>until a legislation is made by the Parliament in this regard.<br/>Since respondent no. 3 has tendered unqualified apology and since the victim accepted that apology, we have decided not to impose any prescribed punishment on respondent No. 3 but respondent no. 3 should be immediately withdrawn/transferred so that the victim could not be subjected to any further harassment by this respondent.<br/><br/>In the light of the finding made above, the Rule is disposed of with the following direction:</div><ol><li style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">The Ministry of Education, respondent No. 1 is directed to ensure that the women working in different educational institutions under it both in public and private sectors are not subjected to similar harassment by their superior and others.</li><li style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">The Ministry of Education shall ensure that the women working in educational institutions under it both in public and private sectors are not subjected to wearing veil or covering their head against their will and that it is their choice to do or not to do so.</li><li style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">The Ministry of Education is also directed to implement guidelines formulated in the case of <em>Bangladesh Jatiya Mahila Ainjibi Samity Vs. Government of Bangladesh</em> in all educational institutions under it both in private and public sectors and to report through the Registrar of the Supreme Court about the action taken on those guidelines.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>There is no order as to costs.<br/><br/>We would like to record our note of appreciation for the learned Advocates Mr. Md. Salahuddin Dolon and Ms. Sara Hossain for their able assistance.<br/><br/>Let a copy of this judgment be communicated to respondent No. 1, the Ministry of Education by a special messenger of this Court at the cost of the office.<br/><strong>       </strong></div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><strong>Ed.<br/><br/>Reference: 4 LNJ (2015) 1</strong></div></div></div>

In the absence of any explanation coming from the husband side it was none other than the husband is responsible for death of his wife. But it appears that all of the prosecution witnesses failed to prove that the convict-appellant demanded dowry at the time of causing death of the victim Ranjina. It also appears that the dead body of the victim was found by the side of the railway track not in the house of the appellant. Since it is wife killing case the onus is upon the appellant to disprove that the victim was not killed by him.         … (10)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Penal Code (XLV of 1860)</strong><br/><strong>Section 302</strong><br/><strong>Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain (VIII of 2000)</strong><br/><strong>Section 11 (Ka)</strong><br/><strong>The judgment and order of the High Court Division having been passed on proper assessment and consideration of material evidence on record, there is no illegality or infirmity in the impugned judgment and order dated 12.06.2008 so far as it relates to the murder of the victim Ranijina, calling for any interference by this Court. But we are of the view that the prosecution miserably failed to prove the case of dowry. So no case was proved under Section 11(ka) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 rather it has proved the case of murder under Section 302 of the Penal Code.

Rahimuddin, father of the victim-Ranjina Begum lodged an ejahar stating, interalia, that Ranjina Begum was given in marriage to the appellant on 12.11.1999; that the house of the appellant is about 5/7 miles away from the house of the informant; that the appellant demanded dowry from the wife of Ranjina, which she could not meet and as a result she was driven out from the house of the appellant, by the appellant and his brothers and mother; thereafter there was a salish over the matter in presence of the local Union Parishad Chairman and according to the advice of the Chairman, the victim Ranjila was sent back to the house of the appellant; that on 26.02.2002 the informant, father of the victim heard from the local people that a dead body of woman was lying by the Railway Lines and after hearing the same the informant and his relatives went there and saw the dead body of the victim Ranjina with injuries on her person. He came to learn that the accused Anarul with the help of other accused persons killed his daughter for dowry and left the dead body by the side of the railway track and ultimately over the said occurrence the informant made a written complaint to the Magistrate on 05.03.2000 on the allegation that he tried to lodge an FIR with the G.R.P. Police but they being influenced by the accused persons did not record the same, for which, he was compelled to make the complaint.<br/> <br/>The defence case as revealed from the trend of cross-examination is that after marriage the victim could not adjust with her husband, the appellant; that as she did not like him, she came back to her father's house and then she was compelled to go back to her husband's house again on the mediation of the local Chairman, but still she could not adjust with her husband that means she did not like him and she committed suicide and the appellant and others have been implicated falsely on the allegation of murder of the victim, for dowry by assault.<br/> <br/>In this case eight P.Ws. were examined on behalf of the prosecution but none was examined on behalf of the defence. The appellant pleaded not guilty at the time of his examination under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is stated that the alleged occurrence took place on 26.02.2002 on the night following and the FIR was lodged on 28.02.2002, so there is chance of embellish-hment of the prosecution case and moreover there is no specific date of demand of dowry by the appellant and there is no mention of any witness in the FIR as to seeing and knowing about the occurrence or demand of dowry.<br/> <br/>The Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Nilphamari (wrongly written as Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Bishesh Adalat, Nilphamari) by the judgment and order dated 16.03.2002 convicted the accused-appellant Anarul @ Anarul Hoq under Section 11(ka) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain,2000 and sentenced him to death and that death would be executed by hanging by the neck till the death subject to the confirmation of death by the High Court Division and also to pay a fine of Tk.10,000/- in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for six months more.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and order dated 16.03.2002 passed by the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Nilphamari the appellant along with two other accused preferred appeal being Criminal Appeal Nos.603 of 2002 before the High Court Division. This criminal appeal was heard along with Death Reference No.08 of 2002 and Jail Appeal No.141 of 2002. A Division Bench of the High Court Division by the impugned judgment and order dated 02.05.2004 accepted the Death Reference-in-part confirming the sentence of death in respect of the present appellant.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by the impugned judgment and order dated 02.05.2004 passed by the High Court Division, the present appellant preferred Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No.164 of 2004 before this Court.<br/>Leave was granted to consider the following grounds:</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Because that the High Court Division misconstrued the provision of Section 11(ka) of the Nari-O Shishu Nirjatan  Daman Ain, 2000 and illegally applied the same in awarding death sentence to the petitioner-appellant, although it has not been proved at all that the alleged killing took place for  Jautuk (dowry) and even demand of the same has not been proved.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Because there is no evidence warranting sentence of death to the petitioner-appellant in view of the evidence of the doctor P.W.7, Farhad Alam who clearly deposed that the Medical Board holding post mortem of the victim's dead body. Could not come to a definite opinion as to whether the death was suicidal or homicidal in nature and the High Court Division misconstrued and misenterpreted the most vital and only evidence in this case namely, result and opinion of the post mortem examination.” </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Mr. Muhammad Nazrul Islam, the learned Advocate has appeared on behalf of the accused-appellant submits that the High Court Division misconstrued the provisions of Section 11(ka) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain,2000 and illegally applied the same in affirming the death sentence to the appellant and dismissing the appeal although it has not been proved at all that the alleged killing took place for jautuk (dowry) and demanding for joutuk has not been proved. He then submits that there is no evidence warranting sentence of death to the appellant in view of the evidence of the doctor P.W.7-Farhad Alam who clearly deposed that the Medical Board holding post mortem of the victim's dead body could not come to a definite opinion as to whether the death was suicidal, accidental or homicidal in nature and the High Court Division misconst-rued and misinterpreted the most vital and only evidence in this case, namely, "result and opinion of the post mortem examination" and as such the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division is liable to be set aside. Alternatively without any prejudice to his earlier submission the learned Advocate further submits that since the prosecution failed to prove the demand of dowry, no case under Section 11(ka) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain,2000 was proved beyond reasonable doubt and the sentence of death penalty be commuted to life imprisonment or to imprisonment for lesser term.<br/> <br/>Mr. Karunamoy Chakma, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing on behalf of the State submits that there is no illegality in the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division in affirming the death reference and dismissing the criminal appeal and the jail appeal which were heard and disposed of analogously.<br/> <br/>We have heard the learned Advocates appearing on behalf of both the parties, perused the judgment and order passed by the Tribunal, the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division and also other materials available on record. On perusal of the records it appears the informant Rahim Uddin as P.W.1, father of the victim who stated in his examination-in-chief that his daughter was sent back to his house after assaulting her on demand of dowry and after settlement the matter by the local chairman he sent his daughter to the house of the accuseds and after a few days on the date of occurrence he found his daughter died following severe torture and his evidence was corroborated by other witnesses. P.W.1 was corroborated by P.Ws.2, 3, 4 and 6 in material particulars. The High Court Division having considered the material evidence of witnesses and the post-mortem report found that in the post-mortem report, the medical board found 12 injuries on the person of the victim. P.W.7-Dr. Farhad Alam proved the post-mortem report of 12 injuries, 8 haematomas are found on the head and legs. The medical board opined that all those injuries were caused by blunt weapons and the board also opined that death was due to haemerrhage and shock as a result of above mentioned injuries which were ante-mortem in nature. Admittedly, there is no eye witness of the occurrence. The case entirely rests upon circumstantial evidence. It was proved by the prosecution beyond doubt that Ranjina was living with her husband just before her death. According to the prosecution the victim was killed by her husband and other relatives at their house and then her dead body was kept by the side of the railway track. The postmortem report supported the prosecution version that Ranjina was beaten to death with blunt weapons rather the accuseds taken a false plea that the victim died of sudden pain in chest. In the absence of any explanation coming from the husband side it was none other than the husband is responsible for death of his wife. But it appears that all of the prosecution witnesses failed to prove that the convict-appellant demanded dowry at the time of causing death of the victim Ranjina. It also appears that the dead body of the victim was found by the side of the railway track not in the house of the appellant. Since it is wife killing case the onus is upon the appellant to disprove that the victim was not killed by him.<br/> <br/>From the aforesaid discussions and findings, we are of the view that the judgment and order of the High Court Division having been passed on proper assessment and consi-deration of material evidence on record, there is no illegality or infirmity in the impugned judgment and order dated 12.06.2008 so far as it relates to the murder of the victim Ranijina, calling for any interference by this Court. But we are of the view that the prosecution miserably failed to prove the case of dowry. So no case was proved under Section 11(ka) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 rather it has proved the case of murder under Section 302 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. As such we are of the view that the sentence should be altered to imprisonment for life under Section 302 of the Code of Criminal Procedure instead of death under Section 11(ka) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000.<br/> <br/>In the premises, Criminal Appeal No. 04 of 2005 with Jail Petition No.10 of 2004 are hereby dismissed with modification of sentence. The accused-appellant Anarul @ Anarul Hoq is convicted under Section 302 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and sentenced him to suffer regorous imprisonment for life. <br/> <br/><strong>Ed.<br/><br/>Reference: 4 LNJ AD (2015) 37</strong></div></div></div>

Since they did not adjust the loan money within the prescribed period of time consequently, legal notice was served upon the debtors. Inspite of service of notice the defendants did not come forward to adjust the defaulted loan amount. Finding no other alternative the respondent-Bank as plaintiff instituted the said suit.<br/> <br/>Defendant no. 1 entered appearance by filing written statement denying the material averments so made in the plaint. The Adalat after hearing the contending parties ultimately decreed the suit on contest against the defendant no. 1 and <em>ex-parte</em> against the rest vide judgment and decree dated 19.8.2004 with direction upon the judgment debtors to pay up the decretal amount within the prescribed period of time. The judgment debtors having not complied with the said direction the respondent bank as the decree holder filed Artha Execution Case no. 190 of 2005 for realization of the decretal amount. The executing Adalat duly initiated process for auction sale of the mortgaged property so had been attached in connection with the said execution case. Ultimately, the mortgaged property had been auction sold to the respondent no. 10. The sale deed had also been executed and registered through Adalat in his favour. Pursuant to the said deed respondent no. 10 took initiatives to recover possession of the property in question through the law enforcing agency.<br/> <br/>At this stage, the petitioners being 3<sup>rd</sup> parties filed application on 16.07.2006 under Order XXI Rule 58 of the Code of Civil Procedure (in short, the Code) read with section 32 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 (in short, the Ain) which was registered as Miscellaneous Case no. 49 of 2006 contending, <em>inter-alia,</em> that the property in question belonged to one Haji Ayub Ali, son of Sabu Matber who died on 31.03.1988 leaving behind two sons named Md. Sawkat Ali and Liakat Ali, two daughters named Atikunnessa and Fatema Begum and one grand daughter named Zahera Khatun, who were enjoying the possession of the case property in <em>ejmali</em>. It has further been contended that the respondent Bank created a loan account in the name of M/s. Islam Trade Point of A.N.M Shamsul Ikram showing Ayub Ali, Sawkat Ali and Liakat Ali as guarantors who alleged to have mortgaged the properties in question as security to the loan. It has also been contended that the respondent Bank instituted the suit for realization of the defaulted loan amount against dead person and that it did not implead the present petitioners as parties to the said suit. Moreover, they did not have knowledge whatsoever about the institution of the said Artha Rin suit. They came to learn for the first time on 13.7.2006 at about 10.30 a.m. while the law enforcing agency made an attempt to evict the petitioners from the case properties. Because of the resistance of the local residents, the auction purchaser (the added respondent 10) could not take possession of the same.<br/> <br/>The executing Adalat after hearing the petitioners and considering the application rejected the same vide impugned order dated 16.7.2006 for not depositing the security money of 25% of the decretal amount, which  is mandatory under section 32(1) of the Ain, 2003 (Annexure-G). Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the same the petitioners had preferred the instant application and obtained the present Rule.<br/> <br/>The added respondent no. 10 entered appearance by filing affidavit-in-opposition stating, <em>inter alia,</em> that this respondent was the highest bidder in auction who purchased the case property for an amount of Tk. 20,28,000.00 (Taka twenty lacs twenty eight thousand) only through Adalat vide registered deed of sale bearing no. 7 dated 7.3.2006 registered at the Sub-Registry Office, Sutrapur, Dhaka and that because of the pendency of the present Rule along with the ad-interim order of stay of the execution proceedings the  possession of the case property could not be recovered.   <br/> <br/>Mr. S.M Munir Sharif the learned Advocate appearing with Mr. Md. Zakir Hossain and Mr. Md. Belayet Hossain, the learned Advocates for the petitioners at the very outset of his submission contends that he will not press the first part of the Rule so far vires of section 32(1) and (2) of the Ain, 2003 is concerned. However, upon placing section 32 of the Ain, 2003 he goes to argue that the legislature has created forum for the 3<sup>rd</sup> parties, who are not parties to the suit, to place their grievance over the mortgaged property which has been put to auction pursuant to execution of the decree. In this regard drawing attention to sections 19, 41 and 42 of the Ain he submits that on every occasion the legislature has clearly expressed its intention to the effect that without deposit of the security along with the application it can not be maintained, whereas section 32 is silent about that. Moreover, he contends that with the use of the words <span style="color:#FF0000">"....Av`vjZ cÖv_wgK we‡ePbvu D³ `vex mivmwi LvwiR bv Kwi‡j...."</span> goes to construe that when an application is filed the executing Adalat has to decide primarily whether there is any <em>prima facie</em> materials to bring in the decree-holder Bank and to hear the claim of the contending parties. If the application is not rejected at the first instance, i.e., if found substance therein, then question of depositing security money comes, which may be deposited at any time as the executing Adalat may prescribe in this regard. In other words, the Adalat without giving any <em>prima facie</em> findings on the merit of the application cannot reject the same on the date of it first hearing on the ground of not-depositing the security money. Accordingly, he submits that since in the present case the Adalat has turned down the prayer of the petitioners filed under Order XXI Rule 58 of the Code on the very 1<sup>st</sup> date of its hearing for not depositing the security money it is liable to be struck down for having been passed without any lawful authority and hence, of no legal effect.<br/> <br/>Md. S.R. Khoshnabish the learned Advocate appearing for the added respondent no. 10 upon placing the judgment and order passed in connection with writ petition no. 7696 of 2006 (Annexure-X to the affidavit-in-opposition) submits that over the case property the brothers of the petitioners have preferred the said writ petition challenging the vires of section 19(3) of the Ain, 2003 along with the judgment and decree dated 19.8.2004 which was passed <em>ex-prate</em> against them. Ultimately, vide judgment and order dated 04.08.2010 the Rule was discharged, which clearly goes to depict the deletory tactics being adopted by the petitioners to prevent the recovery of possession of the case property which has been purchased by this respondent on payment of bid money and that sale deed has also been excuted and registered through Court in his favour on 7.03.2006. He further goes to argue that so far depositing security money with the application is concerned it is abundantly clear from section 32(2) of the Ain for having used the words <span style="color:#FF0000">“.....`vex †ck Kwievi †¶‡Î.....”</span> Accordingly, he submits that the Adalat has committed no illegality in rejecting the application on the ground of maintainability for not depositing 25% of the decretal amount as security. <br/> <br/>Mr. Kazi Rehan Nabi, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent Bank supported the contentions so have been advanced by the added respondent no. 10. <br/> <br/>The cardinal issue requires to be resolved in the present Rule is whether 25% (now 10% vide Act no: 16 of 2010) decretal amount is to be deposited as security at the time of filing the application under section 32 of the Ain; or to be deposited within the time frame, so will be fixed by the Adalat if the application under section 32 of the Ain is not rejected at its 1<sup>st</sup> instance.<br/> <br/>Admittedly, the petitioners are the 3<sup>rd</sup> parties whose claim is that the case property, shown to have been mortgaged as security to the loan, belonged to one Haji Ayub Ali, their predecessor who along with 2 (two) other brothers of the petitioners were impleaded as defendant nos. 3-5 in the Artha Rin Suit no. 179 of 2002 before the Artha Rin Adalat no. 1, Dhaka. The suit was decreed on contest against defendant no. 1 and <em>ex-parte</em> against the rest vide judgment and decree dated 19.8.2004. The said decree was ultimately put to execution in Artha Execution case no. 190 of 2005. Towards realization of the decretal amount, the mortgaged property, claimed to have belonged to the petitioners in <em>ejmali</em>, were auction sold to the added respondent 10 under section 33 of the Ain, 2003 and that sale deed had also been executed and registered in his favour on 7.3.2004 through court. At this juncture, the petitioners had preferred application under Order XXI Rule 58 of the Code on 16.7.2006 (Annexure-F) with prayer to release the case property in their favour on the grounds as stated therein.

Under section 32 (1) the Adalat may reject the prayer at its first instance if found no substance therein for consideration. Under section 32(4), the Adalat after hearing the applicant and the decree holder bank may reject the application, if it is of the opinion that the claim has been made on frivolous ground and that it shall also forfeit the security at the time of its rejection.<br/> <br/>Forum under section 32 of the Ain has been created by the legislature for the 3<sup>rd</sup> parties who are not parties to the suit, nor they are connected with the defaulted loan amount for the recovery of which the decree has been passed in Artha Rin Suit and has been put to execution in Artha Execution case. Vide the said forum they are entitled to ventilate their grievance with a view to release the mortgaged property which has been attached in connection with the execution case. In that view of the matter, if the Adalat does not reject the claim of the applicant at its preliminary consideration it is more reasonable that while issuing notice under section 32(1) upon the decree holder to appear and contest the application it shall direct the applicant to deposit the security under section 32(2) of the Ain within the period of time so has been fixed by it, and that the date so has been fixed must be before the appearance of the decree holder bank. If the applicant fails to comply with the said direction the Adalat shall reject the application under section 32 (2) of the Ain on the very next date.<br/> <br/>It is to be remembered that imposing condition of giving security under section 19(3) of the Ain within 15 (fifteen) days of the filing thereof and under sections 41 and 42 of the Ain along with the Memo of Appeal and revision respectively, is all together different from that of section 32. Under those provisions such imposition has been made by the legislature with a view to realize the decretal amount from the judgment debtor speedily to a certain extent. Under section 32 of the Ain a 3<sup>rd</sup> party is coming forward to protect his right to and interest in the property so has been attached in Artha Execution Case. The condition of depositing security has been imposed by the legislature to prevent frivolous claim so is generally made with a view to delay completion of execution proceeding. However, protection has been given to the decree holder under section 32(4) from such kind of claim. In this regard Mr. Md. S.R.Khoshnabish the learned Advocate submits that since 2006 till date the petitioners and their brothers, the defendant nos. 3 and 4 of Artha Rin Suit no. 179 of 2002, are repeatedly adopting different forums as provided under the law in order to delay the process of recovery of possession of the case property. However, if the petitioners prefer application under section 32 of the Ain in accordance with law and the Adalat  is of the opinion that to delay the execution process frivolous claim has been made it may fall back under section 32 (4) of the Ain and forfeit the security.<br/> <br/>In view of the above observations and findings rejecting the application of the petitioners by the executing Adalat under section 32(1) of the Ain at the first instance for not depositing the security to the tune of 25% of the decretal amount vide order dated 16.7.2006 is not tenable in the eye of law.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the Rule is made absolute in part. The impugned order dated 16.07.2006 passed by the Artha Rin Adalat no. 1, Dhaka in Miscellaneous Case no. 49 of 2006 is hereby declared to have been passed without any lawful authority and hence, is of no legal effect.   <br/> <br/>The petitioners are hereby directed to file application afresh under section 32 of the Ain, if so desires, within 15 (fifteen) days from the date of receipt of the copy of the judgment and order. In default, the Executing Adalat shall proceed with the said execution case in accordance with law.<br/> <br/>There will be no order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.<br/><br/>Reference: </strong><strong>4 LNJ (2015) 60</strong></div></div></div>

It has also been proved that the reconditioned engines were imported instead of new engines in the name of the respondent No.5 not in the name of the appellant or the respondent No.1 or the Project Company. By the conduct of the parties the appellant proved that the respondents failed to perform their part of the contract and make any payment of the outstanding loan and interest amounting to Tk. 63,54,326.33 by 01.01.1984. As per Article 32 clause (b) of the Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha Order, 1972 the violation of the terms and conditions of the loan agreement by the respondents has made the appellant entitled to have the repayment of the loan in full. Article 33 clause (1) (d) of the Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha Order, 1972 contemplates payment of “any other sum” relating to loan with the original loan money when the Sangstha becomes entitled to payment of any loan by reason of the breach of any condition of any agreement between the Sangstha and an industrial concern to which any loan has been granted. Here the expression “any other sum” definitely connotes a sum adjudged as compensation for the breach of contract and to determine the extent of compensation existing bank rate of interest can be taken into consideration. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with cost of Tk. 20,000/-. The impugned judgment and order dated 04.06.2000 passed by the High Court Division in F.M.A. No. 95 of 1990 is set aside and the Miscellaneous Case No. 20 of 1986 is allowed. The respondents are directed to pay the aforesaid amount with a further compensation calculated at the rate of bank interest prevalent at the time of the institution of the suit.    . . .

Muzammel Hossain, J:</strong> This appeal by leave is directed against the judgment and order dated 04.06.2000 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in F.M.A. No.95 of 1990 dismissing the appeal and affirming the judgment and order dated 21.10.1989 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge (presently Joint District Judge), Commercial Court No.2, Dhaka in Miscellaneous Case No.20 of 1986 dismissing the same.<br/><br/>The appellant as petitioner instituted Miscellaneous Case No.124 of 1984 which was subsequently renumbered as Miscellaneous Case No.20 of 1986 before the learned Subordinate Judge, Commercial Court No.2, Dhaka for realization of a sum of Tk. 63,54,326.33 as on 01.01.1984 under Article 33 of the President's Order No.128 of 1972 from the opposite parties-respondents stating, interalia, that the petitioner-appellant Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha (hereinafter referred to as BSRS) was established by P.O. No.128 of 1972 to provide credit facilities and other assistance to industrial concerns and to broaden the base of investment in Bangladesh. On the application of the respondent No.l the appellant-BSRS sanctioned a loan of Tk.70,00,000/- on 18.12.1979 for acquisition of two steel body self propelled Cargo Coasters of 600 DWT each. The loan is repayable in sixteen equal half-yearly installments commencing from two years after disbursement of the first installment which was disbursed on 30.12.1980. To that effect a loan agreement was entered into on 06.06.1980 between the respondent No.1-She Shipping Lines Limited and the appellant-BSRS. Thereafter a tripartite contract was executed on 29.11.1980 between the appellant BSRS, the respondent No.1-She Shipping Lines Limited and the respondent No.5-Rajdhani Ship Building and Engineering Works Ltd. to build the body of two vessels in the dockyard and a total amount of Tk.42 lacs was disbursed in two installments. The first installment of Tk.14 lacs was disbursed for building the body of the Vessels and the last installment of Tk.28 lacs was meant for opening of L/C to import engines for the vessels. The total amount of Tk.42 lacs was disbursed by cheque to the account of the respondent No.5. But the respondent No.5 did not import the new marine engines as per terms of the contract rather they imported reconditioned engines which are now lying in the godown of the Rupali Bank and misappropriated the money. Thirty five percent of the construction of the body of the vessel had been completed on 14.03.1983. Since then no progress had been made though the date of delivery of the vessels as per agreement dated 31.10.1983. The appellant claims that the respondent Nos.l-4 being guarantors are jointly and severally liable to repay the BSRS’s dues.<br/><br/>The respondent Nos.1 and 2 contested the case by filing written objection denying all the material allegations stating, interalia, that the appellant sanctioned an amount of Tk.70 lacs on 18.12.1979 to purchase two steel body self-propelled Coasters of 600 DWT each and the loan was repayable by 16 half yearly installments commencing from 2 years after disbursement of the loan; that a tripartite contract was entered into among the Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha, the appellant, Rajdhani Ship Building Engineering Works Ltd. and She Shipping Lines Ltd., the respondents; that under the tripartite contract the installment was required to be paid to the respondent No.5 directly; that as per terms and conditions of the contract Bank to Bank L.C. was to be opened. But in fact, it was not followed and consequently, the officials of the appellant and the respondent No.5 took advantage of it and misappropriated the whole money; that the respondent Nos.1 and 2 are not responsible for payment of loan money.<br/>The learned Subordinate Judge, Commercial Court No.2, Dhaka found the appellant and the respondent No.5 solely liable for breach of contract and frustration of the project and by the judgment and order dated 21.10.1989 dismissed the miscellaneous case on contest against the respondent Nos.1 and 2 and exparte against the rest without cost. The appellant being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and order dated 21.10.1989 preferred First Miscellaneous Appeal No.95 of 1990 before the High Court Division which was pleased to dismiss the same by the judgment and order dated 04.06.2000.<br/><br/>The petitioner-appellant being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 04.06.2000 passed by the High Court Division preferred the instant Appeal with the leave of this Court.<br/><br/>Leave was granted to consider the following grounds:</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">whether the respondent No.1-She Shipping Lines Limited is a loanee at law, because of (1) the loan agreement entered into between the petitioner and the respondent No.1 on 06.06.1986, (2) the tripartite contract executed on 29.11.1980 by the petitioner-BSRS, respondent No.1-She Shipping Lines Limited and the respondent No.5-builder, Rajdhani Ship Building and Engin-eering Works Limited, (3) the personal guarantees and Demand, Promissory Notes etc. executed by its directors for Tk.42,00,000/- which was received by the respondent No.5-­Rajdhani Ship Building and Engineering Works Limited, (4) the withdrawal and misappropriation of Tk.42 lacs by the respondent Nos.6 and 7, the Managing Director and the Director respectively of the respondent No.5 as agents from it’s account (5) the importation of second hand engines in place of brand new engines.

Nazrul Islam, the learned Senior Advocate appearing for the appellant submits that the respondent No.1, being a loanee at law, under the terms and conditions of the loan agreement, entered into between the appellant and the respondent No.1 on 06.06.1980 and the tripartite contract executed on 29.11.1980 by the appellant-BSRS, the respondent No.1-She Shipping Lines Ltd. and the respondent No.5-builder Rajdhani Ship Building and Engineering Works Ltd., the personal guarantees and Demand, Promissory Notes etc. executed by the Directors of She Shipping Lines Ltd. for Tk.42,00,000/- which was received by the respondent No.5-Rajdhani Ship Building &amp; Engineering Works Ltd., the withdrawal and misappropriation of Tk.42 lacs by the respondent Nos.6 and 7 from the account of the respondent No.5 was done as agents and the importation of second-hand engine in place of brand new engine in the name of Rajdhani Ship Building and Engineering Works Ltd. having done by the directors of Rajdhani Ship Building and Engineering Works Ltd. who are personally liable for their wrong doing, misfeasance, malfeasance and breach of trust and as such all the respondents are liable for payment of BSRS dues. Mr. Nazrul Islam then submits that both the trial Court and the High Court Division were wrong in holding that the respondent Nos.1 and 2 knew only of the disbursement of the first instalment, although by exhibit 19 the respondent No.1, She Shipping Lines Ltd. had requested the appellant, BSRS to disburse second instalment for procurement of engines and that both the trial Court and the High Court Division committed error of law and facts and as such the judgments of the trial Court and the High Court Division are not sustainable in law and in facts. The learned Advocate appearing for the appellant further submits that both the Courts were wrong in not holding that collusion existed between the respondent No.1 and the respondent No.5 and not between the appellant and the respondent No.5. Finally, he submits that the trial Court and the High Court Division were wrong in not holding that by non-completing the project the She Shipping Lines Ltd. and the Rajdhani Ship Building and Engineering Works Ltd. have committed breach of contract violating the provisions of loan agreement and the tripartite contract under which they are bound to complete the Project and as such the appeal is liable to be allowed.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Aftab Hossain, the learned Advocate-On-Record appearing on behalf of the respondent No.2 submits that both the trial Court and the High Court Division concurrently found that the appellant and the respondent No.5 in collusion with each other violated the tripartite contract and as such the respondent No.2 is not liable for money claimed by the appellant. He then submits that the trial Court and the High Court Division have rightly held that the respondent No.2 had no knowledge about payment to the respondent No.5 by the appellant and as such both the respondent Nos.1 and 2 are exempted from any liability of the appellant. Mr. Aftab Hossain contends that both the trial Court and the High Court Division have rightly held that collusion existed between the appellant and the respondent No.5 and the respondent No.2 has nothing to do in respect of loan money of the appellant. The learned Advocate-on-record appearing for the respondent No.2 finally submits that the trial Court and the High Court Division have rightly held that the respondent No.2 is in no way liable for the loan money, on the other hand, the respondent No.2 has been seriously affected for not completing the project by the respondent No.5 and as such the appeal is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>We have heard the learned Advocates for both the parties, perused the leave granting order, impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division, Concise Statements filed by the parties and other materials on record.<br/><br/>In the instant case Md. Junnur Rahman, Senior Principal Officer of BSRS as P.W.1 in examination-in-chief stated that on 18.12.1979 the appellant-BSRS sanctioned a loan of Tk.70,00000/- (seventy lacs) for two steel body self-propelled Coasters of 600 D.W.T. each and the loan was repayable by 16 half-yearly installments commencing from 2 years after disbersment of the first installment and accordingly, an agreement for loan was signed on 06.06.1980 with the respondent No.1. The first installment was disbursed on 30.12.1980. Previously on 28.12.1980, the respondent No.1 requested the appellant to make payment of the first installment in favour of the respondent No.5 by letter dated 24.12.1980 which was proved and marked as Exbt.12 and accordingly, first installment amounting to Tk.14,00,000/- (fourteen lacs) was paid to the respondent No.5. At the request of the respondent Nos.1 and 5, the appellant disbursed the money of second installment amounting to Tk.28,00,000/- on 20.01.1981 with an advice to the Rupali Bank under Wage Earner’s Scheme A/C Rajdhani Ship Building and Engineering Works Ltd. and according to that advice two new engines as per Proforma Invoice were required to be imported through Rupali Bank. The respondent Nos.5-7 violating the terms and conditions of the tripartite agreement imported two old engines. When they were asked about it they stated that on request of the respondent No.1 they had imported these old engines. The respondent No.1 by it’s letter dated 28.08.1982 (Exbt.17) gave their consent in the importation of old engines. P.W.1 further deposed that the respondents collusively imported old engines instead of new engines. In cross-examination P.W.1 stated that the respondent No.1, sponsor and the respondent No.5,builder violated the terms and conditions of the tripartite contract inasmuch as the respondent No.5 violated the terms and condition of the contract by importing old engines and the respondent No.1 violated the terms and conditions of the contract by giving it’s consent to their act. P.W.1 in cross-examination also stated that the appellant did not pay any money to the sponsor, respondent No.1 because it was stipulated in the tripartite contract that money would be disbursed in favour of the respondent No.5. Accordingly, the appellant paid money to the respondent No.5. Initially Tk.14,00000/- (fourteen lacs) was paid. P.W.1 in cross-examination further stated that at the time of payment of second installment amounting to Tk.28,00000/- (twenty eight lacs) they advised for opening of bank to bank L.C. but the sponsor, respondent No.1 did not pay any heed to it. This advice was proved and marked as Exbt.15. The cheque was sent with the advise letter. There was no L.C. number in the advise. P.W.1 in cross-examination also stated that the respondent No.1 in collusion with the respondent No.5, builder encashed payment of second installment. P.W.1 in cross-examination stated that after importation of the engines they came to know that these were second-hand engines and then they called explanation from the respondent No.5 and in reply, the respondent No.5 stated that with the advice of the respondent No.1- sponsor they imported the engines. It appears that the engines were not imported as per specification. The respondent Nos.1 and 5 in collusion with each other imported the old engines and thereby they violated the terms and conditions of the contract. The respondent No.1 on 14.12.1982 gave an undertaking (Exbt.18), stating, that in association with the respondent No.5-builder, they imported old engines for which they are fully responsible. The respondent No.1 by it’s letter dated 06.01.1981 requested the appellant to make payment against second installment whereupon they paid the second installment to the respondent No.5. The letter of request issued by the respondent No.1 was proved and marked as Exbt.19. The appellant performed its part of the contract but the respondent Nos.1 and 5 failed to perform their part of the contract.<br/><br/>Mazharul Huq Majumder, P.W.2, Senior Principal Officer of the Accounts Department of the appellant Bank formally proved the Statement of Accounts which was marked as Exbt.20. A.M. Sirajul Karim, the Company Manager of the respondent No.1-company as D.W.1 in examination-in-chief stated that there was a tripartite contract executed by the appellant-BSRS, the respondent No.1-sponsor and the respondent No.5-builder. As per terms and conditions of the contract the appellant was required to make the payment of loan in favour of the builder-respondent No.5. D.W.1 denied that they in collusion with the respondent No.5-builder had imported old engines to misappro-priate the payment of second installment. <br/><br/>In the instant case it appears that the appellant BSRS sanctioned a loan of Tk.70 lacs in favour of the respondent No.1, borrower, for construction of two steel body self-propelled coasters of 600 D.W.T. each and the loan was repayable by 16 half-yearly installments commencing from two years after disbursement of the first installment as per loan agreement dated 06.06.1980. The first installment of Tk.14 lacs was disbursed on 30.12.1980 to the respondent No.5 as per instruction of the respondent No.1 vide letter dated 24.12.1980 (Exbt.12) and thereafter as per request of respondent Nos.1 and 5, the appellant disbursed the 2<sup>nd</sup> installment amounting to Tk.28 lacs on 20.01.1981 with an advice (Exbt.15) to the account of Rajdhani Ship Building and Engineering Works Ltd. with Rupali Bank endorsing copies of the same to the respondent Nos.1 and 5 to import new Caterpillar 3412 Marine Propulsion Engines as per proforma invoice and in the said advice the appellant categorically stated that the amount would be utilized for the aforesaid purpose. There was a tripartite contract dated 29.11.1980 (Exbt.10) among the appellant-BSRS, the respondent No.1-borrower-purchaser and the respondent No.5-builder to build and deliver to the respondent No.1-purchaser two new steel body self-propelled cargo coasters / vessels in the dockyard. On perusal of memo dated 06.01.1981 (Exbt.19) it appears that the respondent No.1 requested the appellant to disburse second installment to the respondent No.5 for procurement of engines as per appellant’s letter to the latter. At the time of disbursement of second installment of Tk.28 lacs the appellant vide Memo No.E1152 dated 20.01.1981 (Exbt.15) advised to open letter of credit for importing new caterpillar 3412 Marine Propulsion engines but the respondent No.1 did not pay any heed to it. The respondent No.5 in collusion with the respondent No.1 encashed the payment of second installment in their personal name in violation of the terms and conditions contained in the loan agreement dated 06.05.1980 (Exbt.1) and imported two second-hand reconditioned marine engines. When appellant came to know about the second-hand reconditioned engines it called explanation from respondent No.5 who in reply stated that they had imported the second-hand reconditioned engines with the advice of respondent No.1. Thereby the respondent No.1 violated the terms and conditions of the contract. Admittedly, the engines were not imported as per stipulation of the contract. On perusal of respondent No.1’s letter dated 28.08.1982 (Exbt.17) addressed to the respondent No.5, it appears that the respondent No.1 approved the supply of the second-hand re-conditioned engines by respondent No.5. Thereafter, the respondent No.1 admitted that they had violated the terms and conditions of the contract and gave an undertaking dated 14.12.1982 (Exbt.18) to the appellant admitting that the contract was to procure two new engines and the respondent No.5 in association with the respondent No.1 had imported the second-hand re-conditioned engines and that they shall remain responsible for any damage for unsatisfactory performance of the engines and make good the loss from their own resources and accordingly shall make repayment of BSRS loan strictly in accordance with repayment schedule and they shall be bound to compensate for the unsatisfactory performance of the reconditioned engines and shall indemnify the appellant for any loss, liability, harm or damage sustained or caused to the appellant on account of their non-fulfillment of the terms and conditions of the loan agreement or as may be imposed by the appellant at its absolute discretion. In this context it is pertinent to reproduce in verbatim for better appreciation the undertaking dated 14.12.1982 (Exbt.18) which runs as follows:</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;">"Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha (BSRS)"<br/>Agrani Bank Building<br/>Motijheel C/A, Dhaka.<br/><strong><u>UNDERTAKING</u></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Dear Sir,<br/>WHEREAS:</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">You have granted to us She Shipping Lines Ltd. a Company incorporated under the Companies Act,1913 and having our registered office at Previous 17, Siddeswari Lane, Presently: 1-F/3, Mirbagh, Nayatola, Moghbazar, Dhaka-17 a local currency loan of Tk.70,00,00.00 (Taka Seventy lac) on terms and conditions contained in the Loan Agreement dated 06.06.1980 entered into between you and us and at our request placed work order to Rajdhani Ship Building &amp; Engineering Works Ltd.

Section 58 of the Evidence Act,1872 provides that facts admitted need not be proved. As per admission in the undertaking respondent No.1 violated the terms and conditions of the tripartite contract entered into among the respondent Nos.1, 5 and the appellant. It also substantiates the claim of the appellant that the disbursement of the money of the 2nd installment was made with the full knowledge and under the instruction of the respondent No.1 as opposed to the findings of both the trial Court as well as the High Court Division that respondent Nos.1 and 2 knew only of the disbursement of the first installment. It also appears that the High Court Division while holding that the second installment of the money was disbursed without the knowledge of the respondent Nos.1 and 2, lost sight of the letter issued by the respondent No.1 on 06.01.1981 (Exbt.19) to the appellant requesting them to disburse the same to the respondent No.5 the content of which has been duly proved by the appellant.<br/><br/>We will now examine whether the respondent No.1 is a loanee at law. What is loan or debt had been discussed by Lord Justice Lindley in the case Webb v. Stenton, (1883) 11 Q.B.D. 518 at page 527. He opined:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“I should say, apart from any authority, that a debt legal or equitable can be attached whether it be a debt owing or accruing; but it must be a debt, <u>and a debt is a sum of money which is now payable or will become payable in the future by reason of a present obligation, <em>debitum in presenti, solvendum in futuro</em></u>. An accruing debt, therefore, is a debt not yet actually payable, but a debt which is represented by an existing obligation.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The Supreme Court of India in the case of National Royan Corporation Ltd vs The Commissioner of Income Tax, AIR 1997 SC 3487 held as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The liability to repay arises the moment the money is borrowed. The amount borrowed may be repayable immediately or in future. The date of repayment of loan may be deferred by agreement but the obligation or the liability to repay will not cease on that account. The obligation is a present obligation; <em>Debitum in Presenti,</em><em> solvendum in futuro.</em>”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It appears that to become a loanee or debtor a sum of money has to be borrowed or an obligation has to be accepted for which a sum of money is now payable or will become payable in future. In the instant case it is admitted that a loan agreement was executed between the appellant and the respondent No.1. It is also not denied that the appellant made payment of Tk.28 lacs as second installment of the loan money to the account of respondent No.5. It has been duly proved by the appellant that the money of second installment was advanced to the account of the respondent No.5 at the request and with the full knowledge of the respondent No.1. It is admitted fact that the first installment of money amounting to Tk.14 lacs was disbursed by the appellant for building the body of two vessels. After these two payments there is nothing left to make the respondent No.1 borrower of the money.<br/><br/>In O’Driscoll v. Manchester Insurance Committee, (1915) 3 K.B. 499, the Court of Appeal held that where a panel doctor has done work under his agreement with the insurance committee, and the committee have received funds in respect of medical benefit from the National Insurance Commissioners, there is a debt owing or accruing from the insurance committee to the panel doctor.<br/><br/>Lord Justice Swinfen Eady observed at page 512 as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“It is contended, however, that there cannot be a “debt” until the amount has been ascertained, and in support of this contention cases have been cited to us where it was attempted to attach unliquidated damages. But in such cases there is no debt at all until the verdict of the jury is pronounced assessing the damages and judgment is given. Here is a debt, uncertain in amount, which will become certain when the accounts are finally dealt with by the Insurance Committee. Therefore there was a “debt” at the material date, though it was not presently payable and the amount was not ascertained. It is not like a case where there is a mere probability of a debt, as, for instance, where a person has to serve for a fixed period before being entitled to any salary, and he has served part of that period at the time the garnishee order nisi is served. In such a case there is no “debt” until he has served the whole period.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>As observed in the preceding paragraph, this is also not a case where there exists a mere probability of a debt. In the instant case it is clearly a case of taking loan from the appellant and thereby incurring debt liability by the respondent No.1 inasmuch as money was disbursed on request of the respondent No.1 as per tripartite agreement to the respondent No.5. Therefore, inevitably respondent No.1 has become loanee at law.<br/><br/>So, when money is disbursed on request of the respondent No.1 as per tripartite contract to the respondent No.5, inevitably respondent No.1 becomes loanee at law and all consequential liabilities fall upon it. If that money is misappropriated by the respondent Nos.5-7 that does not exempt respondent No.1 from the loan liability. It is more so when seemingly fact of the misappropriation is known to the respondent No.1 from the very beginning as evident from the undertaking given to the appellant by the respondent No.1.<br/><br/>Respondent No.1 after giving undertaking to the effect that due to the violation of the contract by procuring two reconditioned engines instead of two new ones if any damage occurs they would make good the loss from their own resources, and accordingly make repayment of BSRS loan, they can not be exempted from the responsibility as it appears that these two reconditioned engines have been lying in the godown of the Rupali Bank for clearance and the appellant has proved that 35% of construction of body of the vessels was completed by 14<sup>th</sup> March 1983 and thereafter there is no progress of the work though as per agreement the said vessels were required to be delivered within 31.10.1981.<br/><br/>However, after the sanction of the loan there was a tripartite contract on 29.11.1980 between the BSRS-appellant and the respondent Nos.1 and 5. It has been stipulated in the contract that the installments were required to be paid to the respondent No.5-builder in the dockyard and accordingly the appellant paid the said amount. But the mode of payment as stipulated in the tripartite contract was through letter of credit (L.C.).<br/><br/>But it has to be noted that while disbursing the second installment amounting to Tk.28,000,00/- (twenty eight lacs) the appellant advised for opening a letter of credit but the sponsor, respondent No.1 did not pay heed to it. This advice was marked as Exbt.15. The cheque was sent with the advise letter. From the conduct of the appellant it is evident that they did not violate the terms and conditions of the contract, rather non-cooperation of the respondent No.1 resulted in the violation. So the liability does not fall upon the appellant. <br/><br/>The appellant proved that the respondents are not at all interested to complete the project since the under-construction of the vessel had been left abandoned when the reconditioned engines were imported instead of new engines and thereby they violated the terms and conditions of the contract as well as the loan sanction letter. It has also been proved that the reconditioned engines were imported instead of new engines in the name of the respondent No.5 not in the name of the appellant or the respondent No.1 or the Project Company. By the conduct of the parties the appellant proved that the respondents failed to perform their part of the contract and make any payment of the outstanding loan and interest amounting to Tk.63,54,326.33 by 01.01.1984.<br/><br/>As per Article 32 clause (b) of the Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha Order, 1972 the violation of the terms and conditions of the loan agreement by the respondents has made the appellant entitled to have the repayment of the loan in full. Article 32 clause (b) of the Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha Order, 1972 is reproduced below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“32. Notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, the Sangstha may, by notice, require any industrial concern to which it has granted any loan or any person who is liable for payment of such loan forthwith to repay the loan in full, if-<br/>....... .........<br/>the industrial concern has failed to comply with the terms of any agreement with the Sangstha in the matter of the loan; or”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From the aforesaid discussions and findings we are of the view that the appellant as petitioner in the miscellaneous case by adducing both oral and documentary evidence successfully proved their case for recovery of the present outstanding loan with interest of the respondents as on 01.01.1984 amounting to Tk.63,54,326.33.<br/><br/>We also think it a proper case for awarding compensation for violation of contract by the respondents. In Sonali Bank vs. M/S. Karanaphuli Works Ltd., 2 BLT (AD) 78, this Division observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Sec. 34 of the C.P. Code provides that when the court passes a money decree, it may order interest to be paid on the principal sum adjudged from the date of the suit to the date of the decree, in addition to any interest adjudged on such principal sum for any period prior to the institution of the suit, with further interest on the aggregate sum so adjudged from the date of the decree to the date of payment. Purpose of this section has been expressed in a complex sentence, and if it is simplified, it will show that the court has got power to award interest for three distinct periods-(1) the period from the date a sum is payable to the date of institution of the suit, (2) the period during which the suit remains pending and (3) the period from the date of decree till payment of the decretal amount.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the aforesaid case his Lordship Justice Latifur Rahman, as he then was, further observed as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Section 73 of the Contract Act only speaks of compensation for loss or damage caused by breach of Contract. Thus, this section gives statutory recognition for compensation for any loss or damage. Section 73 does not contemplate awarding of any interests by way of damage ..... ....... Strictly speaking under the law interest can not be recovered as damages. Other than an agreement for the payment of interest at a fixed rate or it is payable by the usage of the trade having the force of law or under any substantive law.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>However, in Sonali Bank case (supra) trial court allowed an interest of Tk.33 lacs to the plaintiff for the period from the date the sum was payable to the date of institution of the suit, on the principal sum adjudged at a rate of 15% (the then bank interest rate) taking the ground that had the money due been kept in a bank as deposit, the plaintiff would have received interest to this extent and again allowed interest thereupon at a rate of 15% from the date of institution of the suit till realisation. The High Court Division concurred with the decision of the trial court excepting that the awarding of interest of Tk.33 lacs for the period prior to the institution of the suit was not interest, but compensation in the form of interest. This Division approved the decision holding that interest was not awarded by way of damages but the prevailing rate of bank interest was taken into consideration for measuring business loss and damages of the plaintiff and court is not prevented from adopting this method for determining the amount of compensation as per the existing bank rate.<br/><br/>Article 33 clause (1) (d) of the Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha Order,1972 contemplates payment of “any other sum” relating to loan with the original loan money when the Sangstha becomes entitled to payment of any loan by reason of the breach of any condition of any agreement between the Sangstha and an industrial concern to which any loan has been granted. Article 33 clause (1) (d) of the Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha Order, 1972 is reproduced below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“33. (1). Where the Sangstha becomes entitled to require the immediate payment of any loan before the due date under Article 32 or by reason of the breach of any condition of any agreement between the Sangstha and an industrial concern to which any loan has been granted or any person liable for payment of that loan, or where an industrial concern to which any loan has been granted or any person liable for payment of that loan fails to repay the loan by the due date or in compliance with the notice under Article 32, an officer of the Sangstha generally or specially authorised by the Board in this behalf, may apply to the District Judge within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the industrial concern carries on the whole or a substantial part of its business, or the office or Branch of the Sangstha from which the loan was disbursed is situated, for one or more of the following reliefs, namely:-</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">.............</li><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">..............</li><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">.................</li><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">an order for payment of the loan or any other sum relating thereto.”</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Here the expression “any other sum” definitely connotes a sum adjudged as compensation for the breach of contract and to determine the extent of compen-sation existing bank rate of interest can be taken into consideration.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with cost of Tk.20,000/-. The impugned judgment and order dated 04.06.2000 passed by the High Court Division in F.M.A. No.95 of 1990 is set aside and the Miscellaneous Case No.20 of 1986 is allowed. The respondents are directed to pay the aforesaid amount with a further compensation calculated at the rate of bank interest prevalent at the time of the institution of the suit.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Ed.<br/><br/>Reference: 4 LNJ AD (2015) 18</strong></div><div><div id="ftn1"> </div></div></div></div>

References were contested by the Income Tax department through the learned Deputy Attorney General Mr. Abdur Rahim Bhuiyan who submitted affidavit-in-oppositions in all these I.T. References in more or less in similar assertions wherein it has been asserted that the questions which have been raised by the Assessee-Applicant are absolutely factual and involves no point of law for which those deserve no consideration by this bench; the grounds as have been taken by the Assessee-applicant are defective, misleading and misconceived and not related to the finding of the lower appellate authority and therefore not tenable in the eye of law; the Assessee-applicant having raised irrelevant, untenable and unnecessary contentions, the application in all these references are liable to be rejected and no answer need to be given to the question raised or if given may be given in favour of the tax department.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali, appeared on behalf of the Assessee-applicant while the learned Deputy Attorney General Mr. Abdur Rahim Bhuiyan represented the income tax department at the time of hearing.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali, appearing on behalf of the Assessee-applicant while explained the back grounds of these references taken us through the original assessment orders and the impugned appellate judgments and strenuously argued that the concerned DCT while making the basic assessment violated the Provisions of Section 29(1)27 and 35(3) of the income tax ordinance 1984 in as much as the amount of expenses which has been disallowed by the DCT concerned are business expenditure and that the Assessee-applicant being a company filed with the return the audited accounts certified by the chartered Accounts, but the commissioner of Taxes(Appeal) as well as the Taxes Appellate Tribunal did not pay any heed to it and reduced the amount of disallowance mechanically without entering into the legality of such assessment and as such committed gross illegality in confirming/reducing the disallowances made by the DCT in the profit and loss account, instead of deleting the same in full, in as much as the business of the Assessee-applicant comes from the sale of Air time of mobile phone and also the hand set of mobile phones and accessories which are being imported under an agreement with the principal abroad ‘The Nokia’<br/> <br/>The leaned Advocate Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali further argued that the Assessee-applicant company having maintains regular books of accounts under the admitted mercantile system of accounting, the concerned DCT without pin pointing any defect in the method of accounting ignored the book version of the accounts which being violative of the Provisions of section 35(4) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, is required to be considered by this court in answering the question in negative as has been formulated by the Assessee-applicant and in favour of the Assessee-Applicant. The learned Advocate Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali contend that the method of accounting of the income of the Assessee-applicant  company, being audited by the statutory auditors and confirmed by the Board of Directors of the Assessee-applicant company, which conforms with the standard of accounting and accordingly the concerned DCT was bound to accept the same under the provision of section 35(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and if the DCT disputes any item of the accounts he should at the time of assessment must pin point the same and shall attempt to be satisfied by observing the provision of section 43(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and shall attempt to be satisfied by observing the provision of section 43(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance and cannot arbitrarily reject any of the item. But in the instant case the concerned DCT most illegally and arbitrarily rejected the books of accounts of the Assessee-Applicant in respect of the expenditure and the commissioner of Taxes (Appeal) though reduced some of the disallowances, but the Taxes Appellate Tribunal without rejecting the entire disallowances affirmed the decision of the Commissioner of Taxes (Appeal) and as such the same is required to be considered by this court and the question which has been formulated by the Assessee-applicant  in this respect is required to be answered in negative and in favour of the Assessee-applicant.<br/> <br/>In this respect the learned Advocate Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali relied upon the decision of the case of Titas Gas (T&amp;D) Company Limited-Vs-Commissioner of Taxes reported in 53 DLR 209 and also relied on the case of Eastern Hardware Store-Vs-Commissioner of Taxes reported in 54 DLR 125. He further relied on the case of Commissioner of Taxes-Vs-M/S. Ata Hossain Khan Limited reported in 29 DLR(AD) 141.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali further argued that the discretion which can be exercised by the DCT in respect of disallowances must be exercised within the frame work of the legal sanction and in the instant case the DCT most arbitrarily rejected the expenses and assessed the income of the Assessee-Applicant company in a manner which prejudiced the Assessee-Applicant  not only in the finalization of its account to be placed before its share holders, but also in respect of payment of income tax by the company as the amount in arbitrary assessment of income goes beyond the actual income of the company for a particular year. The learned Advocate Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali contended that the discretion of statutory authority, particularly in the taxation matter, is not a unlimited discretion but should be exercised within the periphery of the legal sanction. In this respect the learned Advocate Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali relied on the case of Mark Builder Limited-Vs-Commissioner of Taxes reported in 59 DLR 463.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali finally argued that the DCT concerned most arbitrarily rejected the claim of the Assessee-Applicant regarding the written off bad debt in the books of accounts, which violated the Provisions of Section 29(1)(XV) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and as such the question as has been formulated by the Assessee-Applicant in this respect is required to be answered in negative and in favour of the Assessee-applicant.<br/> <br/>On the other hand the learned Deputy Attorney General Mr. Abdur Rahim Bhuiyan, appearing on behalf of the Taxes Department argued that the Taxes Appellate Tribunal was legally justified in not accepting the books of accounts submitted by the Assessee-applicant company as the concerned DCT pointed out specific and material defects in the accounts submitted by the Assessee-applicant Company, upon examination of the books of accounts, bills, vouchers and other related papers and the documents which the concerned DCT found unverifiable and tainted with excessive claim with lack of details of the expenses claimed in the Profit &amp; loss Account, sales or receipt of trading expenses.<br/> <br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General argued that the gross profit disclosed in the account can be accepted only where books of accounts are found proper, regular and verifiable in accordance with the accounting principal as per Provisions of Section 35(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984. But if the true and correct picture of income profit and gains cannot be ascertained on the basis of the produced materials, it would be the duty of the concerned DCT to discard the accounting method wholly or in part and to adopt the method of his own as per provisions laid down in clause-C sub-Section 4 of the Section 35 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984.<br/> <br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General Mr. Abdur Rahim Bhuiyan finally argued that the Taxes Appellate Tribunal was legally justified in upholding the disallowance made by the concerned DCT under the head of written off bad debt, since the DCT after examination of the bad debt allowed partial amount which were found authentic and verifiable as against total bad and not receivable debts claimed by the Assessee-applicant and therefore the order passed by the tribunal is really in accordance with law.<br/> <br/>In support of his arguments the learned Deputy Attorney General referred the decisions reported in 58DLR 531, 34DLR(AD) 298 and submitted that those decision established the law as to the point raised in these Income Tax References.<br/> <br/>We have heard the learned Advocate, perused the materials on record and the impugned judgments.<br/> <br/>In all these I T Reference applications one most pertinent question has been raised as to the legality or to extent of latitude available to the DCT as to ignoring the book version of the accounts maintained by the Assessee-applicant when no dispute as to the method of accounts was raised by the assessing officer.<br/> <br/>The power of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes (DCT) to ignore the book of accounts of the Assessee-applicant comes from the provision of section 35(4) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, which runs as follows; <br/> </div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><strong>Income Tax Ordinance 1984</strong><br/><strong><em>Section 35: Method of accounting</em></strong><em>—</em></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>All income classifiable under the head “Income from business or profession” or “Income from other sources” shall be computed in accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed by the Assessee.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), the Board may, in the case of any business or profession, or class of business or profession, or any other source of income, or any class of persons, by a general or special order, direct that the accounts and other documents shall be maintained in such manner and form, and that payments of commercial transactions recorded in such manner, as may be prescribed or as may be specified in such direction; and thereupon the income of the Assessee shall computed on the basis of the accounts maintained, payments made and transactions recorded accordingly.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Without prejudice to the preceding sub-sections, every public or private company as defined in [the Companies Act, 1913 (VII of 1913) or </em><em>­L¡Çf¡e£ BCe, 1994 (1994 p­el 18 ew BCe)</em><em>] shall, with the return of income required to be filed under this Ordinance for any income year, furnish a copy of the trading account, profit and loss account and the balance sheet in respect of that income year certified by a chartered accountant.</em></li></ol><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><em>Where—  </em></div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><em> (a) no method of accounting has been regularly employed, or if the method employed is such that, in the opinion of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes, the income of the Assessee cannot be properly deduced therefrom; or </em><br/><em>(b) in any case to which sub-Section (2) applies, the Assessee fails to maintain accounts, make payments or record transactions in the manner directed under that sub-Section; or </em><br/><em>(c) a company has not complied with the requirements of sub-Section (3);</em><br/><em>the income of the Assessee shall be computed on such basis and in such manner as the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes may think fit.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Sub-section 3 or Section 35 in particular provides as follows;</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><em>“without prejudice to the preceding sub-Sections, every public or private company as defined in the Companies Act 1913 (VII of 1913) or </em><em>­L¡Çf¡e£ BCe, 1994 (1944 p¡­ml 18 ew BCe<strong>)</strong></em> <em>shall, with the return of income required to be filed under this Ordinance for any income year, furnish a copy of the trading account, profit and loss account and the balance sheet in respect of that income year certified by a chartered accountant.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It appears that several disput upon such power of the DCT, exercised erroneously, were raised before this court and the question as has been formulated in this I.T. References, has already been answered in many other previous cases by this Division and also by the apex court of the country one of which is the case of Titas Gas (T&amp;D) Company Limited-Vs-Commissioner of Taxes, decided by the High Court Division and reported in 53 DLR 209, wherein his lordship Mr. Justice Syed Amirul Islam, in a bunch I.T. References applications, decided the similar points where his lordship expressed that;</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><em>“The legal position is that in the computation of income profit and gains of a company, the DCT is entitled to reject the books of account if he is of the opinion that no method of accounting has been regularly employed by the assessee or if the method employed is such that the income of the assessee cannot be properly deduced there from or that a company has not complied with the requirement of sub-section (3) of Section 35 of the Ordinance.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Similarly in the case of Eastern Hardware Store-Vs-Commissioner of Taxes reported in 54 DLR 125 his lordship Mr. Justice Syed Amirul Islam again on a similar point in an I. T. reference application held as under;</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><em>“As the Appellate Additional Commissioner of Taxes did not find any defect either with the method of accounting or in the accounts, neither of them can resort to estimation under Section 35(4)(a) of the Ordinance (1984) and thereby both of them acted illegally and that illegal order has been mechanically affirmed by the Appellate Tribunal which cannot be sustained in law.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Further in the case of Mark Builders Limited-Vs-Commissioner of Taxes reported in 53 DLR 463, his lordship Mr. Justice Md. Abdur Rashid in a similar question upon the provision of section 35(4) of the Income Tax ordinance 1984 raised in I.T. Reference applications, very eloquently decided the point as to the discretion of the assessment officer in rejecting the book version of the accounts of an assessee and held as under;</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">“<em>Under sub-Section (4) of Section 35 of the Ordinance, the Deputy Commissioner of taxes has got power to compute the income on such basis and in such manner as he thinks fit only where (a) no method of accounting has been regularly employed by an assessee being a company or (b) if the method employed is such that in the opinion of Deputy commissioner of taxes the income of the assessee cannot be deduced or (c) a company has not complied with the requirements of sub-Section (3). So, in the absence of any of the above grounds the Deputy commissioner of taxes has got no power to compute the income on any basis or in any manner he thought best.   </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The aforesaid decision although have settled the point and we found no reason to disagree, yet for our self when we further examined the matter found that the  aforesaid provision of section 35(3) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 mentioned about the limited company’s account for which we examined the provision of accounts affair of a limited company as provided in companies Act 1994. In the instant case it has not been disputed that the Assessee-applicant has not filed its audited account regarding trading account, profit and loss account and the balance sheet before the concerned DCT which proves that Assessee-applicant maintaining it account in Mercantile system of accounts. Such method of account of limited company, incorporated under companies Act 1994, is being mandatorily employed under the Provisions of Section 181 of the Companies Act 1994 which mandates a limited company to maintain its books of accounts in certain manner. The provision of section 181 of the companies Act 1994 reads as follows;</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><br/><strong><em><u>Companies Act 1994  </u></em></strong><br/><strong><em>Section 181: Books to be kept by company and penalty for not keeping them:--</em></strong><br/><em>(1)Every company shall keep proper books of account with respect to—</em><br/><em>(a) all sums of money received and expended by the company and the matters in respect of which the receipt and expenditure takes place;</em><br/><em>(b) all sales and purchases of goods by the company;</em><br/><em>(c) the assets and liabilities of the company;

In all these provisions of the companies Act 1994 is allowed to be ignored by the DCT on its latitude to exercise discretion available in section 35(4) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, then one set of provision of law will be frustrated which can not be the intention of the legislature which formulating the provision of subsection (4)c.<br/> <br/>Admittedly the Assessee-Applicant is a private limited company. It has submitted its audited accounts made by the charted accountant pursuant to the requirement of the companies Act 1994 on the basis of the books of account, profit and loss account, trading account and the balance sheet and all these documents were submitted before the concerned DCT. As to the acceptability of Book of account of a company, it has been mentioned by their lordship in the case of Mark Builders Limited-Vs-Commissioner of Taxes reported in 59 DLR 463, upon perusing the case of Appollo tyres Ltd. –vs- Commissioner of Income Tax reported in (2003) 255 ITR No. 273, that the Supreme Court of  India enunciated the principal regarding the acceptability of Books of accounts of a company under the provision of section 115 of the (Indian) Income Tax Act 1961, prevailing in India, in the following manner;</p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“While so looking into the accounts of the company, an Assessing officer under the Income Tax Act has to accept the authenticity of the accounts with reference to the provisions of the Companies Act which obligates the company to maintain its account in a manner provided by the Companies Act and the same to be scrutinized and certified by the statutory auditor and will have to be approved by the company in its general meeting and thereafter to be filed before the Registrar of company who has statutory obligation also to examine and satisfy that the accounts of the company are maintained in accordance with the requirement of Companies Act.”  </em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It has been further stated in the said judgment that under Section 115(j) (1) the (Indian) Income Tax Act 1961, the income tax official shall accept the book profit in the case of an assessee, being a company if such company (i) maintains the accounts in accordance with the Provisions of the Companies Act (ii) scrutinized and certified by statutory auditors and (iii) approved in the general meeting of the company and (iv) examined and certified by the Registrar of companies. It has been further stated;</p><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><em>“that under the Indian Law there cannot be two incomes, one for the purpose of the Companies Act and the other for the income tax since both are maintained under the same Act; the Assessee officer has only power to examine whether the books of accounts are certified by the statutory authority to have been properly maintained under the Companies Act then, the assessing officer has limited power to increase or decrease under the explanation supplied in this Section; In view of such statutory scrutiny, examination and approval of the income at different stages, the assessing officer there enjoys little or no discretion in the assessment of income of a company”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>His lordship Mr. Abdur Rashid in the aforesaid Mark Builders case although found that the such principal as stated by the Supreme Court of India regarding the acceptability of books of account, profit and loss account by the assessing officer cannot be applicable in our law of income tax for lack of aforesaid stated scrutiny, examination and approval, yet the procedure as has been laid down in Companies Act 1994 to follow as to the approval of company accounts is not a futile exercise. The account which has been approved by the Board of the company, as the legislator in the provision of section 35(3) of the Income Tax Ordinance made provisions  for submission of such audited account along with the Income Tax return, cannot be brushed aside and ignored altogether by the Income Tax Authority unless the DCT concerned leave no stone unturned to satisfy itself, specially after serving notice under the provision of section 43(2) of the income tax ordinance, as to the explanation of the account supported by proper document. This satisfaction at the DCT concerned must be made apparent on the assessment clearly and not by making vague statement that the account is not verifiable.  It has been said by his lordship, to which we do also concur, that the latitude available to the DCT under section 35 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 is no doubt very wide, but can not be thought to be without any restraint in the process of assessment of the total income of an assessee under section 83(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984. Discretion available to statutory authority under the statute allowing exercise of statutory power, particularly in the fiscal matter, if thought to be unlimited, then exercise of such discretion may result in arbitrariness and selectively. This discretion can only be applied if not only when the accounts itself is of such nature that the DCT is unable to deduce the actual income of the assessee, but also that the affairs surrounding the accounts of the company does not support the accounts as true as prepared by the company. Unless the DCT found any defect in the method of the accounting it can not discard the account on his own surmise and conjecture. The defect must be clearing described in particular term and not vague.<br/> <br/>In the instant I.T. References the concerned DCT discarded the book of account on the reasoning that the accounts of the company was not verifiable but did not dispute that the method of accounting was not correct. In the absence of such finding, the concerned DCT is not authorized to step into the estimation process. This court has found from the narration of the assessment that all relevant document were submitted before the concerned DCT through which the entire accounts of the assessee was verifiable by the documents as have been filed by the Assessee-applicant before the DCT and the DCT without resorting to those documents, which supported the total income and the GP of the company most arbitrarily assessed the income of the Assessee-applicant company along with the GP which is complete violation of the provisions of Section 35(4) of the Income tax ordinance 1984.<br/> <br/>We have found that the parameter of discretion to be exercised by the DCT has already been decided by the different decisions of this court and therefore the question as has been raised before this court in these references, excepting the I.T. Reference No. 417 of 2008, is required to be answered in negative and in favour of the Assessee-applicant.<br/> <br/>So far the question formulated in I.T. Reference No. 417 of 2008 it appears that the DCT has stated a reason for not allowing a part of the bad debt written off from the companies books of account as deduction in the following context:</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><em>“কোম্পানীর ক্ষমতাপ্রাপ্ত প্রতিনিধি জনাব জে, আর, চৌধুরী, এফ, সি, এ, হাজির হইয়া বিবেচ্য বর্ষে মন্দ ও কুঋণের সৃষ্ট সঞ্চিতি এবং মন্দ ও কুঋণ অবলোপনের সমর্থনে একটি বিবরনী এবং তৎসমর্থনে কিছু প্রমানাদী দাখিল করেন। দাখিলকৃত তথ্য/ প্রমানাদী পরীক্ষা দেখা যায় যে, এস, আর, কে, এন্টারপ্রাইজ কে =১,০৮,৭৪৫/- টাকার জন্য, বুশরা ইন্টারন্যাশনাল কে =২১,৫০০/- ঢ~াকার জন্য, ওয়ান স্টপ সপ কে =৮৪,৮৩৮/- ঢ~াকার জন্য এবং বি,আই,টি,এস,লিমিটেড কে =১,১৪,৭২৫/- টাকার জন্য লিগ্যাল নোটিশ প্রদান করা হইয়াছে। এছাড়া অন্যান্য দেনাদারদের বির্রদ্বে কোন আইনি পদক্ষেপ গ্রহনের প্রমান বিদ্যমান নাই। ফলে এস, আর, কে, এন্টারপ্রাইজ এর বিপরীতে অবলোপনকৃত =১,০৮,৭৪৫/- টাকা, বুশরা ইন্টারন্যাশনাল এর বিপরীতে অবলোপনকৃত =২১,৫০০/-, ওয়ান ষ্টপ সপ এর বিবরনীতে অবলোপনকৃত =৮৪,৮৩৮/- এবং বি,আই,টি,এস, এর বিপরীতে অবলোপনকৃত =১,১৪,৭২৫/- টাকা।মোট অবলোপনকৃত ৩,২৯,৮০৮ টাকা প্রকৃত খরচ হিসাবে অনুমোদন করা হইল”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>But in the same assessment the DCT ignored the other part of written off bad debt on the ground that since the Assessee-Applicant has not taken any legal step for realizing the debt from his principal Nokia, the same cannot be taken into consideration as a bad debt and accordingly the same has been added to the income of the Assessee-Applicant.<br/> <br/>But this court finds that the  reason for such non action against the principal of the Assessee-applicant appears to be cogent as the Assessee-Applicant was required to continue with the business with his Principal Nokia Limited and all the dispute regarding the debt with his principal has to be settled by private negotiation in order to keep the business relation running with the principal and that settlement being a mandatory exercise under the agreement dated 18<sup>th</sup> October, 2001, executed in between the Assessee-Applicant and the Nokia HK Limited, the same is required to be taken into consideration by the DCT who most arbitrarily ignored the supporting documents as have been filed in respect of bad debt and its non-realization. These being the reality in the business world, the DCT was bound to take the matter into consideration upon exercising his discretion available under the provision of section 35(4) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984.<br/> <br/>It appears that the two appellate authority did not resort to the provision of law, rather on mere mercy reduced disallowance as made by the DCT concerned as such this court finds that the judgment passed by the lower appellate authority can not be sustained.<br/> <br/>Upon the discussion and reasoning as above, this court finds merit in the I.T. References and the question as have been formulated in these references for answering in negative.<br/> <br/>Therefore, the questions as have been formulated in all these I.T. References are answered in negative and in favour of the Assessee-Applicant. The taxes appellate Tribunal shall take step in accordance with the provision of section 161(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and dispose of the impugned cases in the light of the instant judgment.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the References succeeds. However there shall be no order as to costs.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.<br/><br/>Reference: 4 LNJ (2015) 28</strong></div></div></div>

The petitioners are in no way connected with the loan or credit facilities availed by the respondent no. 3. This being so, we do not see  their presence is necessary for proper and effectual adjudication  of the Artha Rin Suit filed by the respondent no. 2-Bank against the respondent nos. 3 and 4, who are the borrower and the guarantor of the loan. Sub-section (5) of section 6 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 expressly provides who will be the necessary party in the Artha Rin Suit for the purpose of realization of the defaulted loan money, and as such, the aforesaid provision of Artha Rin Adalat Ain takes away the petitioners necessity in the Artha Rin Suit. Besides, in the averments of the writ petition it is found that the ‘Ga’ schedule property was mortgaged to the respondent-Bank prior to the alleged sell of the same to the petitioners by the respondent no. 3 borrower. When the Act is silent on any particular point then it is permissible to look at other law. But Sub-section(5) of section 6 of the Ain, 2003 particularly expressed against whom Artha Rin Suit can be filed for realization of the defaulted loan money , so, the provision of Code of Civil Procedure does not have implication for the purpose of addition of parties in the instant Artha Rin Suit.     <strong>. . . </strong></em><strong>(10)</strong><br/><em>However, the petitioners, being the third party, may take any other appropriate remedy about their grievances in an appropriate forum in view of the provision of section 32 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 at their own peril. <strong>.</strong></em><strong>..(14)</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>Mr. Md.

The respondent nos. 3 and 4 contested the aforesaid Artha Rin Suit by filing a written statement denying the material averments made in the plaint. At one stage of the proceedings, particularly on 16.5.2013 when the case was fixed for peremptory hearing, the writ petitioners filed an application under Order I, Rule 10(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure  read with section 57 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 for adding them as defendants in the suit on the ground that   they purchased the suit shops and proportionate share  of the Ga-schedule land of the suit from the respondent no. 3 by different registered sale deeds in between 6.4.2008 to 3.11.2011, but the respondent no. 3 with an ulterior motive took loan from the respondent no. 2 bank and mortgaged  the Ga-schedule land to the bank. The writ petitioners knowing about the Artha Rin Suit No. 57 of 2011 became astonished about the conduct of the respondent no. 3. It is also stated in the application that the respondent nos. 3 and 4, being the son and father respectively, took taka near about 3.00 crore from the petitioners by selling the shops and land involved in the Artha Rin Suit.  The respondent no. 2 bank filed written objection against the said application for addition of parties contending, <em>inter alia, </em> that the petitioners  are not necessary parties  since prior to the alleged purchase of scheduled land by the petitioners, it was mortgaged to the respondent no. 2 bank by the alleged vendor of the petitioners. The Artha Rin Adalat, upon hearing the parties and on consideration of law and facts, rejected the said application for addition of party holding, <em>inter alia, </em>  that the applicants are not necessary party in view of sub-section (5) of section 6 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003.<br/> <br/>Against the aforesaid order of the Artha Rin Adalat dated 15.7.2013, the petitioners have come before this Court and obtained this Rule. At the time of issuing of the Rule, this Court stayed further proceeding of the aforesaid Artha Rin Suit for a period of 3 (three) months and lastly on 28.4.2014 it was extended for a further period of 3(three) months from date.<br/> <br/>This Rule is contested by respondent no. 2-Bank through Mr. Hironmoy Halder, learned Advocate, who filed affidavit-in-opposition controverting the statements made in the writ petition.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Badiuzzaman, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner, drawing our attention to the provision of sub-section (1) of section  6 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003, at the out set, submits that the provision of the Code of Civil Procedure will be applicable for the purpose of disposal of the Artha Rin Suit to the extent of not being inconsistent with the provision of the Artha Rin Adalat  Ain, 2003 and for the determination of addition of party in the Artha Rin Suit, the Code of Civil Procedure will squarely be applicable. Mr. Badiuzzaman, further submits that the petitioners are willing to pay the entire claimed amount of the plaintiff-bank and the petitioners are the necessary parties to adjudicate all the issues effectively and completely involved in the suit, and as such, the findings and decisions as arrived at by the Artha Rin Adalat are erroneous and so cannot be sustained in law.  I support of his submissions Mr. Zaman placed reliance on the case of Eastern Bank Limited -Vs- Saudi Bangladesh Industries and Agricultural Investment Company Ltd. reported in 1 ADC (2004) 566.<br/> <br/>Mr. Hironmay Halder, the learned Advocate appearing with Mr. Md. Ziauddin on behalf of the respondent-bank, on the other hand, submits that the petitioners are neither necessary nor proper parties in the Artha Rin Suit and the Court has no jurisdiction to add them as parties under Order I Rule 10(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure as there is  express provision provided in sub-section (5) of section 6 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 that the principal debtor, the third party mortgagor and the third party guarantor are the necessary parties only for the purpose of deciding the Artha Rin Suit filed by the financial institutions. Mr. Halder, learned Advocate, submits further that according to section 53D of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 no immovable property can be re-mortgaged or sold out without the written consent of the mortgagee and any sale or re-mortgage made otherwise shall be void. On that count, the Rule should be discharged, he submits.<br/> <br/>We have heard the learned Advocates  from both the parties, perused the materials on record including the writ petition, annexures thereto, and the affidavit-in-opposition filed by the respondent no. 2 Uttara Bank Limited.<br/> <br/>The only question involved in this Rule is whether the petitioners are the necessary or proper party in the Artha Rin Suit or in other words whether the petitioners can be allowed to pay or fulfill  the claim of the creditor-respondent no. 2 Bank upon making themselves party to the suit. Rule was also issued to examine whether the petitioners, being bonafide purchasers of the mortgaged property as described in the schedule Ga of the plaint in the Artha Rin Suit, have subsisting interest therein and whether Sub-section (5) of section 6 of the Ain, 2003 takes away the petitioners’ right to protect their interest in the property in question and whether the provision of Order I Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure will be applicable in the Artha Rin Suit for the purpose of addition of party/parties.<br/> <br/>For the purpose of determining the fate of this Rule, it will be profitable to examine the relevant provision of Chapter IV of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 which reads as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“৪র্থ পরিচ্ছেদ- মামলা দায়ের আদালতের রীতি ও কার্যপদ্ধতি<br/>৬z(১)     এই আইনের অধীন অর্থ ঋণ আদারতে দায়েরকৃত কোন মামলার বিচার বা নিস্পত্তি সম্পর্কিত কার্যত্র্রমে, এই আইনের বিধানাবলীর সহিত অসংগতিপূর্ণ না হওয়া সাপেক্ষে, The Code of Civil Procedure,1908-এর সংশ্লিষ্ট বিধানাবলী প্রযোজ্য হইবেz<br/>(২)   ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||<br/>(৩)    |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||<br/>(৪)   ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||<br/>(৫) আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠান মূল ঋণগৃহীতার (Principal debtor) বিরুদ্ধে মামলা দায়ের করার সময়, তৃতীয় পক্ষ বন্ধকদাতা (Third party mortgagor) বা তৃতীয় পক্ষ গ্যারান্টর (Third party guarantor) ঋণের সহিত সংশ্লিষ্ট থাকিলে, উহাদিগকে বিবাদী পক্ষ করিবে; এবং আদালত কর্তৃক প্রদত্ত  রায়, আদেশ বা ডিত্র্রী সকল বিবাদীর বিরুদ্ধে যৌথভাবে ও পৃথক পৃথকভাবে (Jointly and severally) কার্যকর হইবে এবং ডিত্র্রী জারীর মামলা সকল বিবাদী-দায়িকের বিরুদ্ধে একইসাথে পরিচালিত হইবে:<br/>তবে শর্ত থাকে যে, ডিত্র্রী জারীর মাধ্যমে দাবী আদায় হওয়ার ক্ষেত্রে আদালত প্রথমে মূল ঋণগৃহীতা-বিবাদীর এবং অত:পর যথাত্র্রমে তৃতীয় পক্ষ বন্ধকদাতা (Third party mortgagor) ও তৃতীয় পক্ষ গ্যারান্টর (Third party guarantor) এর সম্পত্তি যতদূর সম্ভব আকৃষ্ট করিবে:<br/>আরো শর্ত থাকে যে, বাদীর অনুকুলে প্রদত্ত ডিত্র্রীর দাবী তৃতীয় পক্ষ বন্ধকদাতা (Third party mortgagor) অথবা তৃতীয় পক্ষ গ্যারান্টর (Third party guarantor) পরিশোধ করিয়া থাকিলে উক্ত ডিত্র্রী যথাত্র্রমে তাহাদের অনুকূলে সÛানা¿¹রিত হইবে এবং তাহারা মূল ঋণগ্রহীতার (Principal debtor) বিরুদ্ধে উহা প্রয়োগ বা জারী করিতে পারিবেন.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>On a perusal of the aforesaid provision of law and the facts of the instant case, it appears that the petitioners one neither a principal debtor nor a third party mortgagor or even a third party  guarantor as stated in sub-section (5)of section 6 of the Artha Rin Adalt Ain, 2003.

If the answer is negative then there should not be any such question as to the legislative competence of the Parliament.

In order to decide the eligibility or competency of a candidate seeking election to the Parliament for conducting free and fair election through a democratic process Article 12 of the RPO, 1972 was amended by inserting clause (3a) which is not at all ultra vires the provisions of the said Order of 1972 or any of the provisions of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.       ....

The Appellate Division in the case reported in 41 DLR (AD) 165 judicially recognized Article 7 of our Constitution as the ‘pole star’ of the Constitution. Article 7 declared that any law inconsistent with the Constitution will be void to the extent of the inconsistency whereas Article 26 to the Constitution declared that all existing law inconsistent with the provisions of part III of the Constitution (fundamental right) is void to the extent of such inconsistency. Validity of a law is to be tested by the touchstone of the Constitution. In the instant case amendment of Article 12 by insertion of Clause (3a) to the RPO, 1972 has not been enacted in contravention of any of the provisions of the Constitution or any other provisions of law. We do not find any illegality in the provisions of clause (3a) of Article 12 of the Representation of People Order, 1972 providing that nomination paper of an independent candidate shall be submitted along with a list of signatures of one percent electors of the concerned constituency. In view of the above discussions and findings, we do not find any illegality in the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division.            . . .

Muzammel Hossain, J:</strong> This petition for leave to appeal under Article 103 of the Constitution of People’s Republic of Bangladesh is directed against the judgment and order dated 16.08.2010 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Writ Petition No.8780 of 2008 discharging the Rule.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The present petitioner preferred Writ Petition No. 8780 of 2008 before the High Court Division stating, inter-alia, that he as an independent candidate, sought to contest the election of the Parliament from constituency No. 185, Dhaka which was scheduled to be held on 22.01.2007, but the same could not be held due to declaration of Emergency by the Hon'ble President of the Republic. Subsequently, the election schedule was declared by the Chief Election Commissioner to be held on 18.12.2008 and according to the election schedule nomination paper was to be submitted on 20.11.2008. In the meantime, in exercise of power as provided under Article 93(1) of the constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, the President promulgated the Representation of the People (Amendment) Ordinance, 2008 (Ordinance No. 42 of 2008) by amending Representation of the People Order, 1972 (P.O. No. 155 of 1972) which was published in the Official Gazette on 19.08.2008 giving its effect on the same date. Due to this amendment Article 12 of the Representation of the People Order, 1972 (hereinafter referred to as RPO, 1972) has undergone a change by inserting clause (3a) and clause (3b) after clause (3).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The writ petitioner challenged the legality of the amendment by inserting clause (3a) after clause (3) of Article 12 of the RPO, 1972 in Writ Petition No. 8780 of 2008 alleging that it was violative of Articles 26 and 12(1) of P.O. No. 155 of 1972 and Articles 29 and 31 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh and a Rule Nisi was issued on the following terms:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Let a Rule Nisi be issued calling upon the respondents to show cause as to why clause (3a) of Article 12 of the Representation of the People Order, 1972 inserted by Ordinance No. 42 of 2008 providing that nomination paper of an independent candidate shall be delivered along with a list of signatures of one percent electors of the concerned constituency shall not be declared violative of the provisions of Articles 26 and 12(1) of the said Representation of the People Order, 1972 and also violative of Articles 27 and 31 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh and as such is of no legal effect and / or such other or further order or orders passed as to this court may seem fit and proper."<br/>But the Rule could not be heard inspite of the best effort made by the petitioner and the Government having placed the said Ordinance before the Parliament got it ratified by the Representation of the People Order (Amendment) Act, 2009 (Act 13 of 2009). Subsequently, the writ petitioner filed an application before the High Court Division on 30.06.2009 with a prayer to issue a Rule afresh. Thereafter a fresh Rule was issued by the High Court Division in the following terms:<br/>"Let a Rule Nisi be issued calling upon the respondents to show cause as to why the provision of clause (3a) of Article 12 of the Representation of the People Order, 1972 providing that nomination paper of an independent candidate shall be submitted along with a list of signatures of one percent electors of the concerned constituency shall not be declared to be violative of the provisions of Articles 12(1) and 26 of the said Representation of People Order, 1972 and also violative of Articles 27, 31, 66 and 124 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh and / or such other or further order or orders passed as to this court may seem fit and proper."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>A Division Bench of the High Court Division by the impugned judgment and order dated 16.08.2010 discharged the Rule. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and order the petitioner preferred the instant Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal before this Court.  </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Mr. Mohammad Golam Kibria, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner submits that the High Court Division erred in law in passing the impugned judgment and order discharging the Rule having referred to the preamble and Article 7 of the Constitution but passed the impugned judgment and order with inconsistent and contradictory decision by holding in effect the supremacy of the law of parliament over the constitution and as such the impugned judgment and order is liable to be set aside. He then submits that the High Court Division in passing the impugned judgment and order imposed an additional qualification in the case of a voter who wishes to be an independent candidate in the election to the Parliament must also satisfy an additional qualification as laid down in Clause 3(a) of Article 12 of the President's Order No. 155 of 1972 and also holding that Article 12 (3a) of the aforesaid order cannot be derogative to Articles 66 and 124 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and thereby the High Court Division has taken a partisan view of the whole matter based on a prejudicial and wrong presumption about an independent candidate and thus committed an error of law in discharging the Rule. Mr. Kibria submits that the High Court Division by holding that the submission of nomination paper in election to the Parliament is a pre-election process and putting signatures of one percent electors of the concerned constituency on a mere blank paper giving support to a candidate cannot be put at par to the actual voting right to be exercised by an elector on the day of election by casting vote by inserting the ballot paper in the ballot box, and moreover, such list of signatures of one percent (1%) of the electors of the concerned constituency is the expression of mandate to support the competent candidate, and neither our constitution nor the P.O. No. 155 of 1972 requires such expression to be veiled in secrecy as provided under Article 26 of the P.O. No. 155 of 1972, has fully misconstrued the constitution and the RPO, 1972 and as such the High Court Division erred in law in discharging the Rule. Mr. Kibria then submits that the High Court Division by ignoring the fact that every citizen recorded as voter can participate in contesting the election held for the Parliament subject to the Rules of Election as framed by the Election Commission and the Rules such framed must adhere to the provisions of the Constitution to the effect that a voter can participate in the election as a candidate and for the purpose as aforesaid the Rules must be consistent with the provisions of the Constitution and they must not commit excess in making a candidature impossible to participate in the election, erred in law in discharging the Rule. He also submits that the High Court Division by not taking into consideration that there is no specific provision in the Constitution that the candidate must belong to a particular or specific political party, nor an independent candidate has been debarred to participate in the election and that the provision of obtaining the signatures of 1% voter of the constituency by an independent candidate in support of candidature is an impossibility and a bar for him altogether to participate in the election, specially when there is no provision in the constitution to that effect, erred in law in discharging the Rule. He further asserts that the High Court Division by wrongly comparing the submission of nomination paper of an independent candidate for election to the Parliament with the conditions laid down in Article 90(B)(1)(a)(ii) and 90 B(1)(b)(iv) of the RPO 1972 for registration of political parties with the Election Commission, erred in law in discharging the Rule. He finally submits that the High Court Division by holding in a civil matter that since the petitioner has failed to show beyond reasonable doubt that the impugned provision has transgressed the limit laid down by the organic law of the constitution it must be allowed to stand and erred in law in discharging the Rule. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>We have heard the learned Advocate for the petitioner, perused the impugned judgment and order dated 16.08.2008 passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 8780 of 2008 and other materials available on record. The pertinent question in this case is whether the amendment of the President Order No. 155 of 1972 by inserting Clause 3(a) of Article 12 of the RPO, 1972 providing that nomination paper of an independent candidate shall be submitted along with signatures of one percent (1%) electors of the concerned constituency be ultra vires, violative of the provisions of Articles 26 and 12(1) of the Representation of People Order, 1972 and also violative of Articles 27, 31, 66 and 124 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. In this context it is pertinent to refer to the preamble to the Representation of the People Order, 1972 which reads as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"WHEREAS it is necessary to provide for the conduct of elections to Parliament and for matters connected therewith and incidental thereto;<br/>Now, THEREFORE in pursuance to the provisions of paragraph 3 of the Fourth SCHEDULE to the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh and in exercise of all powers enabling him in that behalf, the President is pleased to make and promulgate the following Orders:"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From the preamble it is clear that for the conduct of elections to the Parliament and for matters connected therewith and incidental thereto the RPO, 1972 has been promulgated.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In this context, we may profitably refer to Clause 3(a) and (3b) of Article 12 of the ROP, 1972 which reads as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“(3a) Every nomination paper under clause (2) shall be delivered along with the following documents namely:<br/>(a)     in the case of an independent candidate a list of signature of one percent electors of the concerned constituency;<br/>Provided that such list need not to be delivered if the independent candidate has previously been elected in any parliamentary election.<br/>(b)     a certificate signed by the chairman or secretary or a person holding the equivalent rank on behalf of the registered political party stating that the candidate has been nominated by that party;<br/>Provided that any registered political party may primarily nominate more than one candidate and if more than one candidate are nominated, the name of one nominated candidate shall be sent to the Returning Officer in writing before the scrutiny of the nomination papers.<br/>(3b)  Every nomination paper under clause (2) shall be delivered along with an affidavit signed by the candidate which shall include the following information and particulars, namely-<br/>(a)     an attested copy of the certificate of his highest educational qualification;<br/>(b)     whether at present he is accused of any criminal offence or not;<br/>(c)     whether he has any past criminal record, and if any, the judgment of the case;<br/>(d)     description of his profession or business;<br/>(e)     probable sources of his income;<br/>(f)     a statement of property or rebt of his own or his dependents;<br/>(g)     what promises he made before an election in which he was elected as a member in the past, and how many of those promises were fulfilled; and<br/>(h)     the amount of loan received by him alone, or jointly or by his dependents from any bank or financial institution, and the amount of loan received by him from any bank or financial institution as a Chairman, Managing Director or Director thereof."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The RPO, 1972 was promulgated with the object to provide for the conduct of elections to Parliament and for matters connected therewith and incidental thereto. With the aforesaid purpose the RPO, 1972 has been promulgated. Article 12(1) of the aforesaid Order, 1972 provides that any elector of a constituency may propose or second for election to that constituency, the name of any person qualified to be a member under clause (1) of Article 66 of the Constitution. However, the proviso to clause 12(1) of the aforesaid Order enumerated a long list of grounds of disqualification of a person for election to a seat of a Member of the Parliament. Clause (2) of Article 12 of the RPO, 1972 describes the procedure by which proposal shall be made by a separate nomination paper in the prescribed form which shall be signed by the proposer and the seconder and shall contain a declaration signed by the candidate declaring that he has consented to the nomination and that he is not subject to any disqualification for being, or being elected as, a member of the Parliament and that a declaration signed by the proposer and the seconder that neither of them has subscribed to any other nomination paper either as proposer or seconder and that a declaration signed by the candidate that he is not a candidate for more than three constituencies. Clause (3) of Article 12 provides that every nomination paper shall be delivered by the candidate, or his proposer, or seconder to the Returning Officer or the Assistant Returning Officer who shall acknowledge the receipt of the nomination paper specifying the date and time of receipt. Clause (3) of Article 12 in no uncertain terms postulates the procedure by which every nomination paper shall be delivered by, or on behalf of the candidate to the Returning Officer or the Assistant Returning Officer as the case may be. Whereas Article 26 of RPO, 1972 provides that election under this order shall be decided by secret ballot which reads as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"26. An election under this Order shall be decided by secret ballot and subject to the provisions of Article 27, every elector shall cast his vote by inserting, in accordance with the provisions of this Order, in the ballot box, a ballot paper in the prescribed form."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Moreover, Article 27 enumerates detailed provisions about the persons who are entitled to cast their votes by postal ballot and the procedures applicable thereto.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Article 66 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh postulates qualifications and disqualifications of a person to be elected as a Member of the Parliament if he is a citizen of Bangladesh having attained the age of twenty-five years. Article 66(2) of the Constitution enumerates a long list of grounds of disqualifications of a person for election to the Parliament if he (a) is declared by a competent Court to be of unsound mind; (b) is an undischarged insolvent; (c) acquires the citizenship of, or affirms or acknowledges allegiance to, a foreign state; (d) has been, on conviction for a criminal offence involving moral turpitude, sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than two years, unless a period of five years has elapsed since his release; (e) has been convicted of any offence under the Bangladesh Collaborators (Special Tribunals) Order, 1972; (f) holds any office of profit in the service of the Republic other than an office which is declared by law not to be disqualified its holder; or (g) is disqualified for such election by or under any law.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From the preamble to the RPO, 1972 we have already noticed that the same has been enacted for the conduct of election to Parliament and for matters connected therewith and incidental thereto. Article 12(3) of the RPO, 1972 envisages the procedure by which a nomination paper shall be submitted by or in favour of the candidate to the Returning Officer or the Assistant Returning Officer. The RPO, 1972 has been enacted for conduct of elections to Parliament and for matters connected therewith. The Parliament being authorised to enact necessary legislations for smooth holding of Parliamentary elections and Article 124 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh empowers the Parliament to enact any law with respect to all matters relating to or in connection with election to Parliament which reads as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"124. Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, Parliament may by law make provision with respect to all matters relating to or in connection with elections to Parliament, including the delimitation of constituencies, the preparation of electoral rolls, the holding of elections, and all other matters necessary for securing the due Constitution of Parliament."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Parliament is competent to enact any law and also to make any amendment or modification, alteration or repeal of any law enacted by Parliament subject to the provisions of the Constitution which means it may do so relating to subjects within its legislative competence (Sajjan Sing –Versus- State of Rajesthan AIR 1965 SC 845).     </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>According to Article 65 of the Constitution legislative powers of the Republic vests in the Parliament subject to the provisions of the Constitution. Parliament has plannery power of legislation over all subjects excepting those in respect of which the Constitution has delegated its power to some other authority or in respect of any such subject matter about which limitation has been imposed by the other provisions of the Constitution. In other words, the Plenary Powers of legislation of the Parliament are limited by the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution. Therefore, Parliament can not enact any legislation contrary to the provisions of the Part-III of the Constitution relating to fundamental rights. Article 26 has unequivocally envisages that all existing laws inconsistent to the provisions of Part III shall become void to the extent of such inconsistency. Further, clause (2) of Article 26 restricts the power of the Parliament in enacting any law inconsistent with the provisions of Part III of the Constitution and if any law is so made it shall to the extent of such inconsistency be void.  </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>As per provision of Article 59 of the Constitution the Local Government in every administrative unit of the Republic shall be entrusted to the elected bodies, composed of persons elected in accordance with law. In the case of Kudrat-E-Elahi Panir -Vs- Ahsanullah reported in 44 DLR (AD) 319 the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court held that on construction of Articles 59 and 60, read with Articles 9 and 11 of the Constitution and considering the origin, growth and development of Local Government Institutions at different levels of the Administration over one and a half centuries, it is found that Local Government is an integral part of the democratic polity of the country. ...... ........... ......... For an Institution to be a Local Government under the Constitution, two requirements are to be fulfilled. One is that a Local Government is constituted in an "administrative unit", and the other is that the Local Government is entrusted to a body composed of elected persons. An "administrative unit", as defined in Article 152(1), is a "district or other area designated by law for the purposes of Article 59". In the case of a district, no designation is necessary, but it is necessary in all other cases as was done in the case of unions and municipalities by Act IX of 1973.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The Appellate Division further observed that the other constitutional requirement for these local bodies is that they shall be entrusted to bodies "composed of persons elected in accordance with law". The existing local bodies are, therefore, required to be brought in line with Article 59 by replacing the non-elected persons by election.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It is the mandate of the Constitution under Article 135 that Parliament can not enact any law which empowers an authority subordinate to an authority by which a person who holds any civil post in the service of the Republic shall be dismissed or reduced in rank, inasmuch as, no law shall be made by the Parliament changing remuneration, privilege and other terms and conditions of a person holding or acting in any office to which the Article applies to the disadvantage of the holder of the aforesaid office during his terms of office.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The expression "subject to the provisions of this Constitution" mentioned in Article 65 of the Constitution means the provisions of Article 65 of the Constitution are to be interpreted subject to any other provisions of the Constitution containing limitations imposed upon the legislative and the constituent power of the Parliament as already discussed above. Where the legislative competence of the Parliament to enact a law is questioned one has to consider as to whether it has enacted any law inconsistent with provisions of Part III or any other provisions of the Constitution. If the answer is negative then there should not be any such question as to the legislative competence of the Parliament. The Court may ascertain the legislative policy from the provisions of the Act of Parliament including its preamble, scheme and even the subject matter of the legislation.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>We have already discussed that the Parliament have within it's constitutional limitations plenary powers of legislation which include its power to legislate either absolutely or conditionally or it may authorize subordinate bodies to make bye-laws or regulations under a statute or it may enact permanent or temporary legislation or it may legislate either prospect-ively or retrospectively or it may legislate by reference or incorporation. Further the parliament in addition to its power of direct legislation it has power to amend, repeal, modify or alter any law within its legislative competence. The principles have been recognized by the Indian Supreme Court in the Case of Sajjat Sing -Vs- State of Rajsthan AIR 1965 SC 845. The validity of an Act of Parliament depends upon whether the Parliament has any power under the Constitution to enact such Act.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the instant case the pertinent question before this Court is whether the Parliament by amending Article 12 of the RPO, 1972 inserted clause (3a) providing that nomination paper of an independent candidate shall be submitted along with a list of signatures of 1% electors of the concerned constituency being violative of the provisions of Articles 12 and 26 of the said Order of 1972 and also violative of Articles 27, 31, 66 and 124 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. The competence of the Parliament to make a law is to be determined with reference to the Constitutional Provisions relating to the power of the Parliament to enact law as they exist at the time of enactment of the same. In order to determine the true nature of a legislation challenged as to its legality the Court must look to the substance and not merely the form of the legislation. In doing so the Court has to examine the object of the legislation for the purpose of ascertaining the true character and the substance of the legislation and the class of subject of legislation to which it belongs. In order to examine the vires of a law or any enactment or an existing law the legislative powers of the Parliament being limited by the provisions of the Constitution a law enacted without legislative competence is a nullity. Clause (3a) of Article 12 of the RPO, 1972 was inserted by amendment of Article 12 Representation of the People (Amendment) Ordinance, 2008, adding some additional requirements in respect of an independent candidate while submitting nomination paper along with the same a list of signatures of one percent electors of the concerned constituency. By the same Ordinance, Chapter VIA under the heading "Registration of Political Parties with the Commission" was replaced by amendment wherein a special provision under Article 90A has been introduced requiring registration of any political party willing to participate in election under this Order with the Commission subject to the fulfillment of one of the conditions laid down in Article 90B(1) which provides that every political party shall fulfill one of the following conditions, namely:</div><ol><li style="margin-left: 40px;">secured at least one seat with its electoral symbol in any parliame-ntary election held since the independence of Bangladesh; or</li><li style="margin-left: 40px;">secured five percent of total votes cast in the constituencies in which it’s candidates took part in any of the aforesaid parliamentary elections; or</li><li style="margin-left: 40px;">established a functional central office, by whatever name it may be called, with a central committee and district offices in at least ten administrative districts and offices in at least fifty Upazilas or Metropolitan Thanas.</li></ol><div>In addition to complying with the aforesaid terms and conditions referred to in clause (1) (a) of Article 90B, the political party is required to comply with the other terms and conditions incorporating such specific provisions in it’s Constitution as mentioned in Article 90B(1)(b). Moreover, in order to be eligible to contest Parliamentary Election, the name of a candidate of a political party, has to be included in the panel nominated by the Central Parliamentary Body of the party from the panels prepared by the members of the Ward, Union, Thana, Upazila or District Committee, as the case may be of the concerned constituency. Article 90C has been inserted in the RPO, 1972 by the Representation of the People (Second Amendment) Ordinance, 2008 wherein certain grounds have been stated which disqualify a political party to be registered under chapter VIA of the RPO, 1972 including the objectives laid down in the constitution of the party are contrary to the provisions of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh or any discriminations regarding religion, race, caste, language or sex or by any other activity it threatens to destroy communal harmony etc. Article 66 of the Constitution contains qualifications and disqu-alifications of a candidate for being elected as Member of Parliament which amongst others postulates that the candidate must be a citizen of Bangladesh who has attained the age of 25 years. A long list of disqualifications have been enumerated in Sub-Article (2) of Article 66 of the Constitution. According to the provisions of Article 124 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh the Parliament by amending Article 12 of the RPO, 1972 inserted clause (3a) to Article 12 of the RPO, 1972 imposing certain conditions in respect of submissions of nomination of an independent candidate supported by a list of signatures of one percent electors of the concerned constituency and in case of a candidate of a Political Party a certificate signed by the Chairman or Secretary or a person holding the equivalent rank on behalf of the registered political party stating that the candidate has been nominated by the party.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>We have already considered Article 26 of the Representation of People Order, 1972 which postulates that an election under this order shall be decided by secret ballot. The framers of the Constitution have consciously made provisions that fundamental rights enumerated in Part III of the Constitution are fully guaranteed. Article 26 of the Constitution provides that the state shall not make any law inconsistent with any provision of Part III of the Constitution and any law so made to the extent of such inconsistency be void. Article 27 of the Constitution guarantees equal protection to all citizens and thereby establishes equality before law. Whereas Article 31 guarantees right to protection of law and to be treated in accordance with law. Article 66(1) of the Constitution envisages the requisite qualificati-ons and disqualifications of a person to be elected as or to be a member of Parliament if he is a citizen of Bangladesh and has attained the age of 25 years. However, Sub-Clause (2) of Article 66 enumerated a long list of disqualifications for being a member of a Parliament. Article 124 enables the parliament to make any law with respect to all matters relating to or in connection with elections to Parliament including the de-limitation of constituencies, the preparation of electoral roles, the holding of elections and all other matters necessary for due constitution of Parliament.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>This addition of clause (3a) to Article 12 of the Order of 1972 cannot be termed as ultra vires the Articles 12 and 26 of the Representation of the People Order, 1972 or Articles 27, 31, 66 and 124 of the Constitution. Because with the insertion of this provision the Legislature has intended to stop any whimsical, frivolous and malafide filing of nomination paper of a candidate in Parliamentary Election or participation with an ulterior motive to disrupt the normal election process in the constituency. Insertion of the aforesaid provisions by amendment of Article 12 of the RPO, 1972 is also to give impetus to the genuine independent candidate outside of a political party in any constituency of the Parliamentary election.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>We are of the view that inclusion of such requirement is intended to have check on public expenditure and to watch and ensure that no public money is unnecessarily expended on such whimsical candidates. It is true that Article 26 of the Order of 1972 provides that an election shall be decided by a secret ballot subject to the provisions of Article 27. Of course Article 27 provides for postal ballots. It is our considered opinion that the provisions contained in clause (3a) of Article 12 of the Order of 1972 is a pre-election requirement of an independent candidate or any candidate nominated by a Political Party which is not in any way contradictory to the provisions of Article 26 of the said RPO because Article 26 conceived of an election process which requires an election under the RPO, 1972 shall be decided by secret ballot. In order to decide the eligibility or competency of a candidate seeking election to the Parliament for conducting free and fair election through a democratic process Article 12 of the RPO, 1972 was amended by inserting clause (3a) which is not at all ultra vires the provisions of the said Order of 1972 or any of the provisions of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Subject to the provisions of the Constitution Article 124 empowers the Parliament to make any law with respect to all matters relating to or in connection with elections to Parliament as making of law or enactment of any law by Parliament also includes the power of the Parliament to amend, alter, modify or repeal laws for holding a free and fair election to Parliament for establishment of democracy and Rule of law which are the basic feature of our Constitution as judicially recognized by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Constitution 8th Amendment case, namely, Anwar Hossain Chowdhury -Vs- Government of People’s Republic of Bangladesh and others, 41 DLR (AD) 165. However, the basic features of the Constitution are the independence of the judiciary, separation of powers of the legislature, the executive and the judiciary and Rule of law and democratic Government under the provisions of the Constitution.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the instant case we are required to discuss what is meant by amendment of a statute. Amendment of a statute connotes various meaning depending upon its context. In the case reported in 41 DLR (AD) 165 his Lordship observed as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"My conclusion therefore is that the word 'amendment' is a change or alteration, for the purpose of bringing in improvement in the statute to make it more efective and meaningful, but it does not mean its abrogation or destru-ction or a change resulting in the loss of its original identity and character. In the case of amendment of a Constitutional provision, 'amendment' should be that which accords with the intention of the makers of the Constitution."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In Oxford's Advanced Learners Dictionary the word 'amendment' means a change or improvement that is made to a law or a document; the process of changing a law or a document. In K.J. Aiyar's Judicial Dictionary (15th edition, 2011) a broad definition of the word 'amendment' has been stated which means the word 'amendment' will include any alteration or change for improving or creating any law or any other instrument or pleadings with special reference to court cases. In the case reported in 41 DLR (AD) 165 at page 252 the Appellate Division observed that amendment of a statute may have various meaning depending upon its context. Dictionary meaning of the word 'amendment' is change for a purpose of effecting improvement or removing any defect. The Appellate Division quoted with approval the definition of amendment stated in Crawford's Statutory Construction which is reproduced below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"'Amendment' is a change in some of the existing provisions of a statute --------- a law is amended when it is in whole or in part permitted to remain and something is added to, or taken from it, or it is in some way changed or altered in order to make it more complete or perfect or effective ----------- an amendment is not the same as a repeal although it may operate as a repeal to a certain degree .................. a repeal is the abrogation or destruction of a law." </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>His Lordship S. Ahmed, J (as his Lordship then was) having referred to "Murphy's Constitution, Constitutionalism and Democracy" quoted with approval the definition of amendment which runs as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"Thus an 'amendment' corrects errors of commission or omission, modifies the system without fundamentally changing its nature, that is, an amendment operates within the theoretical parameters of the existing Constitution."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Amending power given by the Constitution to Parliament is a higher power than any other power given to the Parliament i.e. its a power which emanate from the Constitution. Having considered a long series of decision of Common Wealth countries his Lordship S. Ahmed, J (as his Lordship then was) observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"My conclusion therefore is that the word 'amendment' is a change or alteration, for the purpose of bringing in improvement in the statute to make it more efective and meaningful, but it does not mean its abrogation or destruction or a change resulting in the loss of its original identity and character. In the case of amendment of a Constitutional provision, 'amendment' should be that which accords with the intention of the makers of the Constitution."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It is well established that an ordinary statute is enacted through the ordinary legislative process but amendment of a constitutional provision is effected through a special procedure as prescribed in the Constitution. It has been observed by the Appellate Division in the decision of the case reported in 41 DLR (AD) 165 that validity of a law is tested by the “touchstone of the Constitution”; but there is no such “touchstone” of the validity of the Constitution because its validity is inherent and that any amendment of such constitutional provision is unchangeable if it affects the basic structure or feature of the Constitution.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the instant case we are called upon to examine whether the amendment of Article 12 of the RPO, 1972 by insertion of clause (3a) which provides that nomination paper of an independent candidate shall be submitted along with a list of signatures of one percent electors of the concerned constituency is violative of the provisions of Articles 12 and 26 of the said Order of 1972 and also violative of Articles 27, 31, 66 and 124 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>We have also noticed that arguments have been advanced on behalf of the petitioner stating that the impugned amendment is ultra vires the RPO, 1972 and also the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The doctrine of ultra vires drives itselves from the mother theory of corporate law i.e. theory of perpetual succession. If a company is established for a particular purpose and its existence is complemented by that purpose. When the Board of Director of a company or its Member does an act which is not within the purpose or object of that company then the company will not be bound by such act and that object or purpose shall be ultra vires of the company and this theory has been established in England in the case of Ashby Railway Carriage and Iron Co. Ltc. -Vs- Rich (1875 LR 7 HL 653) and subsequently this theory was strengthened and applied in the case of Attorney General -Vs- Great Eastern Railway Co..</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The word "ultra" means beyond and the word "vires" means powers. So we can state that the term "ultra vires" means beyond powers. Many authors have expressed their views that the expression is used to mean any act performed in excess of the powers of the authority or the person who performs the act. According to professor Wade the ultra vires doctrine is not confined to cases of plain excess of power; it also governs abuse of power, as where something is done unjustifiably, for the wrong reasons or by the wrong procedure. In law the consequences are exactly the same; an improper motive or a false step in procedure makes an administrative act just as illegal as does a flagrant excess of authority. Unless the courts are able to develop doctrines of this kind, and to apply them energetically, they cannot impose limit on the administrative powers which Parliament confers, so freely, often in almost unrestricted language. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In Indian jurisdiction the doctrine of ultra vires has been applied to statutes, rules and orders and equally it also applied to the regulations and any other subordinate legislation. While talking about the competence of State legislature in making enactment which is not covered by the exclusive list II but relates to a subject included in list I it has been stated that it is a patent case of ultra vires because of Article 246 (Constitution of India) inasmuch as it is beyond the competence of the State legislature under clause (2) and patent to the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament under clause (1) of Article 124 of the Constitution of India.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>However in Bangladesh context both the Divisions of the Supreme Court have delivered a number of judgments which were reported in many leading law journals. In the case of BADC -Vs- Shamsul Haque reported in 60 DLR (AD) 152 the Appellate Division held that the vires of Regulation 55(2) though challenged the High Court Division declined to declare the Regulation as ultra vires as the High Court Division thought it prudent to dispose of the case otherwise than by striking down the regulation. The approach of the High Court Division is appreciated because when a case can be decided without striking down the law but giving the relief to the petitioners that course is always better than striking down the law.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the case of Full Chand Das -Vs- Md. Hammad reported in 34 DLR (AD) 361 the Appellate Division observed that since section 4 as substituted by Ordinance X of 1964 was delcared ultra vires the Constitution, and by operation of Sub-Article(2) of Article 6 of the Constitution it was void ab initio meaning it was non est, it means that section 4(new) never came into existence. Such declaration obliterates the provisions of law from the statute, as if it was never incorporated in the statute book. In that case Section 4 (new) substituted Section 4(old) and section 4(new) having been declared ultra vires the Constitution being in conflict with the Fundamental Right; it became void ab initio which means section 4(new) was non est, as if it never came into existence.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In that case the Appellate Division observed that a valid law cannot be substituted or repealed by an invalid unconstitutional law. But then what will happen on such declaration. The section of the law being ultra vires the Constitution in meaning it was never incorpo-rated in the statute book and the existing section or the law remained unaffected. In that process of operation of law section 4(old) remained unaffected in the statute and it continued to be operative, principles of sound interpretation of statute does not contemplate a legal vacuum in the statute and thereby making the statute unworkable.  </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The expression "subject to the provisions of this Constitution" in Article 124 of the Constitution indicates that the object of Article 124 is to empower the Parliament to make any law making provision with respect to all matters relating to or in connection with elections to Parliament for securing due Constitution of Parliament. But it does not exempt the Parliament from any of the limitations which are imposed by the other provisions of the Constitution upon its legislative power. The Parliament has plannery powers of legislation which are limited by other provisions of the Constitution as discussed above. Moreover, the powers of Parliament cannot be restricted by an obligation undertaken by the Government. The competence of a Parliament to enact any law is to be determined with reference to the constitutional provisions in respect of the power of the Parliament as they exist at the time of enactment of the law. In the case of Chamarbaugwalla RMD. -Vs- Union of India 1957 SCR 930 the Supreme Court of India held that where there are clear and unequivocal words in the statute which is going to show that the Parliament has transgressed the limitation laid down in the Constitution, the Court will pronounce the enactment to be ultra vires. Similar decisions have also been delivered by both the Divisions of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. It has been established in a number of leading cases of the Apex Courts of the Sub-continent that in order to determine the vires of the law or an enactment the Court must look to the substance not merely to the form of the legislation which includes the effect of the legislation and object or purposes of the legislation. For the purpose of ascertaining the true character and substance of the statute and the classes of subjects of legislation to which it belongs the Court has to examine the object of the enactment. It has also been well established by the Apex Courts of the Sub-continent that an enactment passed by the Parliament without legislative competence is void, ab initio. In the instant case we have seen that the provisions contained clause (3a) of Article 12 of the Representation of People Order, 1972 have not been enacted without any legislative competence nor is it in conflict with the other provisions of RPO, 1972 or any other provisions of law. The Appellate Division in the case reported in 41 DLR (AD) 165 judicially recognized Article 7 of our Constitution as the ‘pole star’ of the Constitution. Article 7 declared that any law inconsistent with the Constitution will be void to the extent of the inconsistency whereas Article 26 to the Constitution declared that all existing law inconsistent with the provisions of part III of the Constitution (fundamental right) is void to the extent of such inconsistency.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>We are in respectful agreement with the observation of this Division in 41 DLR (AD) 165 that validity of a law is to be tested by the touchstone of the Constitution. In the instant case amendment of Article 12 by insertion of Clause (3a) to the RPO, 1972 has not been enacted in contravention of any of the provisions of the Constitution or any other provisions of law.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Therefore we do not find any illegality in the provisions of clause (3a) of Article 12 of the Representation of People Order, 1972 providing that nomination paper of an independent candidate shall be submitted along with a list of signatures of one percent electors of the concerned constituency. In view of the above discussions and findings, we do not find any illegality in the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Accordingly, the Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal is dismissed.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Ed.</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>Reference: 4 LNJ AD (2015) 1</strong></div></div></div>

In the instant case the justification for the withdrawal is apparent from the application filed in Court by the learned Public Prosecutor. Although the learned trial Judge did not elaboratly discuss the reasons for allowing the withdrawal of the case, quite clearly that materials relating to the decision to withdraw the case were placed before him and considered by him. The further proceedings in the case would be an exercise in futility. Where the informant did not specify the manner and identity of the assailants vis à vis the injuries inflicted and when the other eye witnesses have been tendered by the prosecution, the possibility of corroborative evidence coming forth in the trial is non-existent. After 25 years from the date of occurrence the trial was started and deposition of prosecution witnesses were recorded on 11.03.2013. According to the FIR, apart from the informant, there were three other prosecution witnesses present in the room where the occurrence took place. Those three witnesses have been produced by the prosecution as PWs 2, 3 and 4. All three were tendered and cross-examination declined by the defence. There is no illegality or infirmity in the impugned judgement and order. And there is no reason to interfere with the impugned judgement and accordingly this criminal petition for leave to appeal is dismissed.     . . .

The petitioner had filed the criminal revision under section 435 read with section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure challenging the legality of order No. 15 dated 08.04.2010 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Rajshahi in Sessions Case No. 259 of 2002 allowing an application under section 494 of the Code of Criminal Procedure filed by the learned Public Prosecutor for withdrawal of the said sessions case in respect of accused respondents No. 1 – 9.</h4><div style="text-align: justify;">The facts of the case relevant for disposal of the instant criminal petition for leave to appeal are as follows:<br/>          An incident took place at midnight following 17.11.1988 in the hall of residence, namely Latif Hall of Rajshahi University, where some students of the “Chhatra Sangram Parishad” attacked some other students of the “Islami Chattra Shibir”, injuring a number of them. One victim, namely Aslam Hossain, the President of Islami Chattra Shibir succumbed to his injuries. The informant, Md. Nayeb Ali, a student of the same university lodged the First Information Report (FIR) with Boalia Police Station, Rajshahi in the morning of 18.11.1988 at 9:55 A.M. thus giving rise to Boalia P.S. Case No. 14 dated 18.11.1988. It was alleged in the FIR that around 50 students, of whom 30 were named, armed with various weapons entered into Latif Hall chanting slogans <strong>“</strong><strong>ধর ধর শিবির ধর, ধরে ধরে জবাই কর</strong>”. The informant and the victim along with three others, namely Akhter Hossain, Harun-or-Rashid Mukul and Shafiqul Islam barricaded themselves in room No. 339. The accused persons broke open the door and upon entering, assaulted the victim and the three others, and left thinking that they were dead. They took the informant and locked him up in another place.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>We find from the records that the case has a very chequered history. After investigation, police submitted charge sheet dated 15.02.1989 against 14 accused persons, including respondent No. 1, but recommended discharge of 16 accused persons, including respondent Nos. 2–9. The informant filed a Naraji petition on 16.02.1989. After further investigation, the second charge sheet dated 14.05.1989 was submitted excluding the 16 accused persons who had been recommended to be discharged in the first charge sheet. The informant lodged a further Naraji petition dated 19.06.1989. A judicial enquiry was held wherein deposition of six witnesses were recorded. In due course, by order dated 18.11.2002 the case was taken up for framing of charge against 34 accused persons. Some of the accused persons filed an application for discharge under section 265C of the Code of Criminal Procedure. After due hearing, 17 accused persons, including present respondents Munna Shaha, Ali Raihan,  Rabiul Alam Babu, Masud Parvez, Ahsan Kabir Badol, Ayub Ali and Firoz Ahmed were discharged. Charge was framed against 17 accused persons, including present respondents Md. Ruhul Quddus Babu and Abdul Karim Shikder. Thereafter, the informant challenged the order of discharge by filing Criminal Revision No. 367 of 2003 before the High Court Division whereupon Rule was issued 03.05.2003 and trial of the case was stayed. Subsequently, by judgement and order dated 02.07.2009, the Rule was made absolute and the order discharging the 16 accused persons was set aside. It appears from the order of the Additional Sessions Judge dated 28.03.2010 that an application was filed by the prosecution under section 494 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for withdrawal of the criminal case against respondent Nos. 1–9. The application was supported by a memo No. <strong>স্বম (আইন -১)/মামলা প্রত্যাহার-১/২০১০ (১২তম সভা)/ ১০৯৬</strong> dated 10.03.2010 issued by the Legal Department of the Ministry of Home Affairs. The learned Public Prosecutor stated in his application that a false case had been brought against these respondents for political reasons in order to harass them and the same has been on-going for 22 years, and it is still at the stage of framing charge.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Upon consideration of the submission made by the learned Public Prosecutor and the learned advocate appearing on behalf of the respondents, the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Third Court, Rajshahi by his order dated 28.03.2010 allowed the application for withdrawal of the case against the respondents.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The father of the victim, petitioner herein, along with the informant, pro-forma respondent herein, filed Criminal Revision No. 1017 of 2010 before the High Court Division under section 439 read with section 435 of the Code of Criminal Procedure challenging the order allowing withdrawal of the case against the respondent Nos. 1–9, whereupon Rule was issued. When the matter was ultimately made ready for hearing and appeared in the cause list, the petitioner sought adjournment for two weeks, but only one day’s adjournment was granted. The petitioner then filed an application for that particular Bench not to hear the matter. The said application having been rejected, the Rule was heard ex parte and by the impugned judgement and order, it was discharged. The petitioner then filed the instant criminal petition for leave to appeal before this Division.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Before us, the petitioner was represented by Mr. Zainul Abedin, learned Advocate-on-Record, whilst the State, respondent No. 10 was represented by Mr. Mahbubey Alam, the learned Attorney General. His submissions were adopted by the learned Advocates appearing for respondent Nos. 3, 4, 5-7 and 9 who were represented respectively by Senior Advocate Mr. M.K. Rahman, Advocate Mr. Qamrul Hoque Siddique, Senior Advocate Mr. M.I. Farooqi and Advocate Mr. A.M. Amin Uddin. Respondent Nos. 1, 2, 8 and 11 were not represented.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Mr. Zainul Abedin submitted that The High Court Division discharged the Rule without considering that the sanction of the government for withdrawal of the case was a mechanical one and that in allowing the application for withdrawal the learned Additional Sessions Judge acted most perfunctorily and allowed the withdrawal without giving any reasons. In support of his submission, he referred to the decisions in the cases of <strong><em>Bakshu Mia Vs. Govt. of Bangladesh and others</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>30 DLR (SC) 228,</em></strong> <strong><em>Prativa Rani Dey (Tirtha) vs Dr Mohammad Yousuf Chittagong Medical College and others</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>52 DLR (AD)8</em></strong> and <strong>Shah Obaidul Mannan and another –Versus- The State and another</strong> reported in <strong><em>8 BLT (AD) 42. </em></strong>He submitted that the High Court Division has caused serious miscarriage of justice in affirming the order of withdrawal without considering the fact that the case involves the question of the murder of a student and furtherance of the cause of justice demands that the trial should be allowed to proceed against all the persons named in the FIR. Finally, he submitted that the informant was not given a proper opportunity to place the case before the High Court Division nor was it considered that the informant was not given notice of the decision to withdraw the case against the respondents and was not heard by the learned Additional Sessions Judge and thus caused miscarriage of justice.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The learned Attorney General submitted that the withdrawal of the case against the respondents was totally in accordance with the law. He referred to the circular of the government dated 22.02.2009 concerning the formation of a committee and its functions in respect of withdrawal of cases which were started at various times for political reasons for the purpose of harassment. He submitted that, the committee scrutinised the instant case along with numerous other cases, and it was decided that the case brought against the nine respondents was purely for the reason of their political affiliation. Accordingly the government decided, upon taking the opinion of the Public Prosecutor, to instruct withdrawal of the case. The learned Attorney General submitted that the whole process was done entirely in accordance with law and procedures laid down in the circular. He further pointed out that the decision of the government is clearly explained in the memo which was placed by the Public Prosecutor before the Court along with his application under section 494 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He submitted that it is apparent from the memo of the Legal Department of the Ministry of Home Affairs that the committee set up under the circular dated 22<sup>nd</sup> of February 2009 was satisfied upon scrutiny of the case materials that the case was started due to political motivation and had been continuing for 22 years and was a cause of harassment for the accused persons. These reasons were incorporated in the application filed by the learned Public Prosecutor under section 494 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The learned Attorney General submitted that, though the order discharging the respondents from the case is brief, it is apparent that the learned Judge considered the matters adverted to in the application filed by the learned Public Prosecutor, including the fact that the government had decided to withdraw the case against the respondents and that the case had been on-going for 22 years and it was still at the stage of framing of charge. In support of his submissions, the learned Attorney General cited the decision in the case of <strong><em>Sikandar Ali Sikdar Vs. State and others</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>31 DLR (A.D.) 135</em></strong> where it was observed that if the Magistrate is confronted with an order of the Government to show that the decision was taken at the highest level of administration he is not required to go further and sit on judgement on the decision of the Government. Their Lordships held that the decision at the Government level should not be taken lightly and there must be cogent facts and compelling reason before the Court inducing it to act otherwise. The learned Attorney General also referred to the decision in the case of <strong><em>Abdul Wahab Talukdar alias Mohd &amp; ors Vs. State and another</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>30 DLR (SC) 278</em></strong> where their Lordships observed that the order of the Magistrate was without reason. But the question was whether there was material on record to sustain his order, in that the materials on record supply grounds for his according consent to withdraw.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The learned Attorney General placed before us the additional paper book dated 08.06.2014 and drew our attention to the latest developments of the case. He pointed out that three out of the four alleged eyewitnesses have been examined by the trial Court and none has implicated the accused persons. As a result the present position is that the remaining accused persons against whom the trial was proceeding, have been acquitted upon application by the learned Public Prosecutor under section 494 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In passing the order of acquittal, the learned Judge noted that the case had been going on for 26 years and that the accused persons had been implicated in the case for political rivalry and harassment. It was also noted that six witnesses had been examined, but the allegation against the accused could not be proved and other important witnesses, including the Investigating Officer, did not appear to give evidence.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Finally, the learned Attorney General submitted that undeniably the respondents were members of a political students’ association and were falsely implicated by another political students’ association for political reasons, and hence the government righty decided to withdrow the case against the accused.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The learned Advocates appearing for the respondent Nos. 3, 4, 5-7 and 9 adopted the arguments placed before us by the learned Attorney General.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocate on Record appearing for the petitioner and the learned Attorney General appearing for the State, perused the impugned judgement as well as the evidence and materials on record.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It appears from the impugned judgement that although the petitioner in the criminal revision was absent at the time of hearing of the Rule, the points raised in the revisional petition were elaboratly dealt with by the High Court Division. Essentially, the matters raised before this Division have already been dealt with <em>in extenso </em>in the impugned judgement. The decisions of the Supreme Court and Appellate Division, which have been also cited before us, have been elaborately discussed by the High Court Division.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The learned Advocate on Record appearing on behalf of the petitioner submitted that the decision of the learned Judge of the trial Court was mechanical and accordingly should have been set aside in view of the decisions of our Supreme Court and Appellate Division cited by him.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The clear view of this Division is that in allowing the withdrawal of the case under section 494 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the trial Court must assign reasons/grounds for such withdrawal upon consideration of materials before it; and the order of acquittal/discharge must not be mechanical. We have carefully perused the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of <strong><em>Bakshu Mia Vs. Govt. of Bangladesh and others</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>30 DLR (SC) 228</em></strong>. Their Lordships held that in granting consent to withdraw, the Court must exercise a judicial discretion. However, their Lordships went on to observe that the Magistrate need not specify the grounds for granting consent if there is material on record to reveal the ground of withdrawal. Their Lordships specifically held that the Court giving consent to withdraw is not required to give reasons, though it is desirable to do so, but there must be sufficient ground for withdrawal and the Court must be satisfied on some materials on record about the cogency of the ground. In that particular case, the Special Public Prosecutor in his application for withdrawal conveyed the decision of the Government to withdraw the case. The Special Public Prosecutor filed the application on disclosing that fact, and on consideration of these facts and attending circumstances the Special Tribunal’s order was passed. Their Lordships observed that the material disclosed by the Special Prosecutor is the decision of the Government to withdraw. A decision at the high level of administration of the Government should <em>prima facie </em>be a sufficient ground for withdrawal unless of course it could be shown that the decision was mala fide done for collateral purpose.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From the facts and circumstances of the instant case, it appears to us that there was ample reason apparent in the application for withdrawal to justify the order passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge allowing the withdrawal and discharging the respondents. It is also patent from the records that due process was followed by the government and the Public Prosecutor in arriving at the decision to withdraw the case against the respondents.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Section 494 of the Code of Criminal Procedure makes no mention of any activity on the part of the government with regard to withdrawal of any case, and in fact the function so far as withdrawal under the Code is concerned, lies entirely with the Public Prosecutor. However, it must be borne in mind that the Public Prosecutor acts on the instruction of the government and has to justify the reasons for withdrawing the case to the satisfaction of the Court concerned. In the instant case the justification for the withdrawal is apparent from the application filed in Court by the learned Public Prosecutor. Although the learned trial Judge did not elaboratly discuss the reasons for allowing the withdrawal of the case, quite clearly that materials relating to the decision to withdraw the case were placed before him and considered by him.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Moreover, we note from the additional paper book that subsequent developments indicate that the most important witnesses have already been examined in the case and they do not support the prosecution case against the respondents before us and other important witnesses are not forthcoming. We also note that the informant, who is allegedly an eye witness to the occurrence, did not specify which of the assailants assaulted the victims nor the manner in which and the weapons with which the victims were struck. Where the occurrence took place inside a room in the hall of residence and the blows were dealt in front of the very eyes of the informant, it would be expected that the details of the weapons used and the specificity of the blows dealt upon the victims would be more vividly described and the actual assailants of the deceased victim more clearly identified.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the light of the above discussion, we are of the view that further proceedings in the case would be an exercise in futility. Where the informant did not specify the manner and identity of the assailants vis à vis the injuries inflicted and when the other eye witnesses have been tendered by the prosecution, the possibility of corroborative evidence coming forth in the trial is non-existent. After 25 years from the date of occurrence the trial was started and deposition of prosecution witnesses were recorded on 11.03.2013. According to the FIR, apart from the informant, there were three other prosecution witnesses present in the room where the occurrence took place. Those three witnesses have been produced by the prosecution as PWs 2, 3 and 4. All three were tendered and cross-examination declined by the defence. The learned Judge noted in his order dated 28.01.2014 that important witnesses were not coming forward in spite of witness warrants having been issued. He then proceeded to acquit the remaining accused upon an application filed by the Public Prosecutor under section 494 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for withdrawal of the case against the accused.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>When eye witnesses do not support the prosecution case, it would be impractical and unwise to look to circumstantial evidence to secure conviction of the accused.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">        <br/>          The High Court Division having most elaborately discussed all the relevant points, discharged the Rule. We find no illegality or infirmity in the impugned judgement and order. We find no reason to interfere with the impugned judgement and accordingly this criminal petition for leave to appeal is dismissed.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Ed.</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong>Reference: 4 LNJ AD (2015) 30</strong></div></div></div>

Rezaul Hasan, J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>Let the supplementary affidavits filed by the petitioner do form part of the substantive petition.<br/><br/>This petition has been filed under section 233 of the Companies Act, 1994 (herein after referred to as (the Act).<br/><br/>It has been stated in the petition, amongst other, that the Petitioner No. 1 is a founder shareholder and director of the Respondent No. 1 Company, holding 10% shares in the paid-up capital of the respondent company. The Petitioner No. 1 was also the first and only Managing Director of the Company up until 23 March 2013, on which date the Respondent No. 2 and 3 removed him from the said position by passing a Board Resolution to that effect in a Board Meeting. The Petitioner No. 2, sister of the Petitioner No. 1, is also a founder shareholder and director of the Respondent No. 1 Company, holding 10% of its issued shares. The Petitioners, both individually and jointly, fulfill the condition imposed by section 195 (a) of the Companies Act 1994 (hereinafter referred to as “the Act”) of the required minimum shareholding (one-tenth of the issued shares) prior to filing this application under section 233 of the Act; that the Respondent No. 1 (hereinafter referred to as “the Company” or “the Respondent No. 1”) is a private company limited by shares, incorpor-ated under the Companies Act 1994 on 23 August 2005, bearing Registration No. <em>C-58732(738)/05. </em>The Company operates in the energy sector of Bangladesh and has a current portfolio of 110MW. The Company currently operates a 10MW Gas Fired power plant in Kumargaon, Sylhet and a 100MW Diesel Fired power plant in Siddhirganj, Narayganj. The Founder shareholders and directors of the Company were as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Md Jahangir Alam<br/>NuherLatif Khan (the Petitioner No. 1)<br/>Shahpar Saba (the Petitioner No. 2)<br/>MrsTasneem Sultana;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">that the Respondent No. 2 is a shareholder and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company. Md. Jahangir Alam stated above transferred his shareholding in the Company to the Respondent No. 2 on 5<sup>th</sup> February 2006.The Respondent No. 2 is also the Chairman of all the companies in the Mohammadi Group. It is pertinent to note that the main office from which the Company operates is the main office of Mohammadi Group. Also all office employees except for specialist engineers of the Company are Mohammadi Group employees. The entire accounts of the Company are done by the finance team of the Mohammadi Group. The Respondent No. 2 now holds 75% of the issued shares of the Company. The Respondent No. 3 is a shareholder and director of the Company. He is also the son of the Respondent No. 2. He acquired his shares from Mrs. Tasneem  Sultana stated above on 5<sup>th</sup> February 2006. He now holds 5% of the issued shares of the Company. The current shareholders of the Company, together with the number of shares they hold and the percentages of their respective shareholding are as follows:</div><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 122px; text-align: justify;"><strong>Name of Directors</strong></td><td style="width: 64px; text-align: justify;"><strong>Number of Shares</strong></td><td style="width: 88px; text-align: justify;"><strong>Percentage of Shareholding</strong></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 122px; text-align: justify;">Mr. AnnisulHuq</td><td style="width:64px"><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"> </li></ol></td><td style="width:88px"><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"> </li></ol></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 122px; text-align: justify;">Mr. Nuher Latif Khan</td><td style="width:64px"><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"> </li></ol></td><td style="width:88px"><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"> </li></ol></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 122px; text-align: justify;">Ms. Shahpar Shaba</td><td style="width:64px"><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"> </li></ol></td><td style="width:88px"><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"> </li></ol></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 122px; text-align: justify;">Mr. Navidul Huq</td><td style="width:64px"><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"> </li></ol></td><td style="width:88px"><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"> </li></ol></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">that although technically the Company was a private company limited by shares, it was formed and always run as a typical quasi-partnership company. In other words, it was formed and continued on the basis of mutual confidence and a personal relationship between and amongst the Petitioners and Respondent Nos. 2 and 3. There existed an implied understanding between all of the shareholders that they shall actively participate in the management of the Company. In addition, the Articles of Association contained restrictions upon transfer of a shareholder’s shares in the Company - so that if confidence is lost, or one member is removed or excluded from management, he cannot take out his stake and go elsewhere. In the light of the above, the Petitioners (despite being minority shareholders) always had a legitimate expectation of being actively involved in the management of the Company. Indeed it is to give effect to that legitimate expectation that the Company was managed and/or controlled by two groups, the first group comprising the Respondents No. 2 and 3 and the second group comprising the Petitioner No. 1 and 2, with the Respondent No. 2 and Petitioner No. 1 being the leaders of their groups respectively and the Respondent No. 3 and Petitioner No. 2 having an identity of interest with the former. In line with the legitimate expectations, the Respondent No. 2 became the Chairman of the Company and the Petitioner No. 1 was made the first Managing Director of the Company, and continued to hold that office up until 23 March 2013 when he was unceremoniously removed from it; that the Petitioner No. 1 was an integral part of and played a pivotal role in the progress of the Company from its very inception in August 2005 and has successfully added110MW to the current portfolio of the Company. His journey in the power sector of Bangladesh started after completing his B.A in. Economics and Business with East European Studies from the University College London (UCL), which is among the top universities in the United Kingdom and also ranks as one of the finest in the world. He is widely recognized for his outstanding achievements in the power sector in Bangladesh despite his young age. His success, as expected, attracted media coverage. He has also been recently interviewed by The Smart CEO Magazine, coveringan exclusive community of CEOs and business leaders who are visionaries, mentors and well-respected leaders. Further, in recognition of the Petitioner No. 1’s performance as the Managing Director of the Company, he was granted special privileges, approved by way of a board resolution in a properly convened board meeting, like the use of an expensive company car; that although the Petitioner No. 1 was the Managing Director of the Company, the Respondents No. 2 and 3, the controlling majority shareholders, jointly holding 80% of the shares of the Company, were always actively involved in the management of the Company and were by no means silent equity investors. The close control that they exercised over the Company’s management can be gathered from the facts that all accounts of the Company were and are still being handled by Mohammadi Group (the Respondent No. 2being the Chairman and majority shareholder of the companies in this group) employees, the main office from which the Company operates is a Mohammadi Group office, the Company bank accounts can only be operated by joint signatures, one from each group, Group A comprising the Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 and Group B comprising the Petitioners and joint signatures of the Respondent No. 2 and the Petitioner No. 1 are required on all loan and security documentation of the City Bank Limited. During the tenure of the Petitioner No. 1 as the Managing Director, all important decisions and/or tasks like business model preparation, negotiation with banks, price calculations, technical offers, signing of contracts with government agencies, banks etc. were all done pursuant to express Board approvals. The Board explicitly agreed on obtaining bank loans for its projects, term sheets of which were agreed upon by the Board. With regards to price and technical offers made to the Bangladesh Power Development (“BPDB”), these activities being undertaken through competitive tendering, the prices stipulated in the tender and consent to quote such prices were all supported by Board resolutions. As the Managing Director, the Petitioner No. 1was merely given the authority to sign hundreds of pages of documents that were required in tenders (commercial, technical or otherwise), and execute contracts with BPDB, on terms and conditions that have already been approved by the Board of Directors, at the time of tender submission; that the relationship of trust and confidence between the Petitioners and the Respondents No. 2 and 3 deteriorated over the past two years as the Respondents most illegally and arbitrarily, and in complete violation of the legitimate expectations of the Petitioners, excluded the Petitioners from major management decisions, usurping the role of the Managing Director and the Board, and started conducting the affairs of the Company in a manner that was tantamount to serious mismanagement. In addition, the Respondents No. 2 and 3 have resorted to outright threats, intimidation and bullying tactics to the point of forcing the Petitioner No. 1 out of his own office; that, amongst the many instances of serious mismanagement, the Respondent Nos. 2 and 3’s decision to buy spare parts and consumables from BCB Metal Trading Company (“BCB”) and Mir Power Services Limited (“Mir Power”), was seriously detrimental to the interest of the Company. Bangla Trac Limited, an authorized local dealer of the world renowned Caterpillar, has supplied all the equipment necessary for the two power plants of the Company. Previously, the Company used to buy spare parts and consumables from Bangla Trac Limited itself which was also responsible for the maintenance work on those machines. However, the Respondents No. 2 and 3 arbitrarily decided to buy spares and consumables from BCB, a Canadian Company and Mir Power, a local trading company, instead of Bangla Trac Limited.  Both, BCB and Mir power are not authorized dealers of Caterpillar and the spare parts they have supplied to the Company were not genuine. In addition, the Respondents No. 2 and 3 has been lately using random service providers to do preventative maintenance work on their power plants. All of this culminated in a major breakdown in one of the Company’s power plants, requiring repairs in excess of USD 300,000.00 (Three Hundred Thousand US Dollars) must to the financial detriment of the Company. Both, the Petitioner No. 1 and Bangla Trac Limited, have warned the Respondent No. 2 in this regard time and again, but to no avail.<br/>Photocopies of the letter from the Petitioner No. 1 to the Respondent No. 2 dated 3 February 2013, and letter from Bangla Trac Limited to the Petitioner No. 1 dated 2<sup>nd</sup> April 2013 are annexed hereto; that another instance of serious mismanagement on the part of the Respondent No. 2 and 3 is their arbitrary decision, without the consent of the Board and without the knowledge of the Petitioner No. 1, who was the Managing Director of the Company at the relevant time, to settle unsubstantiated and frivolous claims made by BPDB by agreeing to almost 6% deductions by BPDB on account of excess outage from their monthly invoices for three months from November 2012 to January 2013 as reflected in the Company’s Invoices for those months read with the BPDB’s debiting/payment instructions to Bangladesh  Krishi Bank and the Revenue Account Statement of the Company. The Petitioner brought it to the Respondent No. 2’s attention time and again that the Company was not at fault for excess outage, but to no avail. The excess outage has mostly taken place due to the fact that the BPDB had failed to clear the Company’s invoices as per Article 13.2 of the Contract for Supply of Electricity on Rental Basis for 3 Years between the Company and BPDB, that is, within 15 working days of issue of invoice. As a result, the Company could not service its power plants, which eventually led to excess outages. In any case, BPDB had made unsubstantiated claims in the past against Desh Cambridge Kumargan Power Company Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, in relation to its 10 MW power plant operations and was successfully sued for illegal deduction from monthly invoices. Despite having such knowledge, the Respondent No. 2 refused to take legal action against BPDB and arbitrarily accepted almost 6% deductions from monthly invoices. As a result, the Company suffered deductions amounting to hundreds of thousands of US dollars, which is highly detrimental to the interest of the Company and its shareholders has been annexed to the petition; that in addition, since the Respondents No. 2 and 3 have illegally and arbitrarily usurped control of the management of the Company from the Board of Directors and the role of the Managing Director, they have failed to conduct the essential Annual Capacity Tests of the 100 MW to the detriment of the Company. Already almost two months have elapsed since the scheduled date of that test. The Company contract with BPDB for Supply of Electricity puts the Company under a contractual obligation to carry out this test within the scheduled date. The Petitioner No. 1 has sought an explanation from the Respondent No. 2 with regard to this delay but the Respondent No. 2 has not yet provided any explanation and/or justification for the delay; that in complete violation of the legitimate expectation of the Petitioner to be actively involved in management of the Respondent No. 1 Company, he was excluded from major management decisions and from operating the Company’s bank account. That the Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 operated the Company’s bank account without the Petitioner’s signature, contrary to a Board Resolution <strong><u>(Annexure G) </u></strong>passed on 3.06.2010. The Board Resolution mandated that the Company’s bank account would be operated under joint signatures from any one of the members of the designated Group A, consisting of Respondent Nos. 2 and 3, and Group B, consisting of the Petitioner and his sister.  Despite such a resolution and instructions to the Company’s bank, Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 withdrew an amount of Tk. 28,00,000.00 without the Petitioner’s signature on the cheque; that the Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 made the major decision of reaching a settlement with BPDB by agreeing to almost 6% deduction from monthly invoices without the Board’s approval and without notifying the Petitioner No. 1, thus usurping his role as both, a director and the Managing Director of the Company. In addition, lately, the Respondent No. 2 has not been forwarding any letter from the BPDB to the Petitioners thus excluding the Petitioners from all dealings with the BPDB; that for the last two years the Petitioner No. 1, despite being the Managing Director and a Director, was forced by the Respondents No. 2 and 3 to stop using the Company’s premises as his office. This, the Respondents No. 2 and3 did by resorting to all sorts of threats and bullying tactics to the extent that the Petitioner No. 1 feared for his own physical safety and security and was forced to stop using the Company’s office and operate from a different venue; that the Respondents No.2 and 3 continued to harass and bully the Petitioner No. 1 further by stopping his fuel allowance, his cell phone allowance, seizing the Company car that was at his disposal, and making false and baseless allegations against him, solely intended to create a false basis for eventually dismissing him from his position as the Managing Director of the Company, which was the ulterior motive of the Respondents No. 2 and 3 all along. The Petitioner wrote multiple letters to the Respondent No. 2 challenging various decisions taken by the Respondents No. 2 and 3 arbitrarily and seeking clarification as to why the Petitioner No. 1 being the Managing Director and a Director was being excluded from major management decisions. The Respondent No. 2, while ignoring most of those letters, through letter dated 27 February 2013 to the Petitioner No. 1, as a devious defence tactic, made a host of random, false and fabricated allegations against the Petitioner No. 1. Amongst others, the Respondents No. 2 and 3 claimed that it was the Petitioner No. 1’s negligence when negotiating the contract with Bangla Trac Limited (caterpillar appointed dealer in Bangladesh) for supply of machines that caused the excess fuel consumption for which the BPDB deducted over 9 Crores taka from five invoices of the Company from November 2011 to March 2012. The Respondent No. 2 alleged that Bangla Trac limited misrepresented the specifications of the machines. Bangla Trac Ltd through letter dated 27 January 2013 to the Respondent No. 2 refuted all these allegations and attributed the cause of excess fuel consumption the high sulphur content of the fuel provided by BPDB, using the wrong unit of measurement (HHV) instead of LHV, frequency and voltage fluctuations, frequent start/stop, poor operation of generator sets, using fake or damaged spare parts from BCB and Mir Power and using outside service providers for maintenance.  The Petitioner No. 1 responded to the Respondent No. 2’s letter by a letter dated 21 March 2013 refuting the false and fabricated allegations, pointing out the major decisions on the part of the Respondents No. 2 and 3 that was tantamount to serious mismanagement and expressing serious concern over the manner in which the Respondents No. 2 and 3 have been and are arbitrarily running the affairs of the Company to the serious prejudice of the Petitioners and the detriment of the Company; that in the Board Meeting dated 23 March 2013, the habitual antagonism and hostility of the Respondents No. 2 and 3 towards the Petitioners, in particular, the Petitioner No. 1 culminated in the Respondents No. 2 and 3 dismissing the Petitioner No. 1 from his position as the Managing Director and appointing the Respondent No. 2 as the new Managing Director by exercising their majority voting rights. The Petitioner No. 1 has not reviewed the Minutes of the said meeting yet as he has not been provided with the same despite a formal request; that in the light of the irretrievable breakdown of the relationship between the Petitioners and the Respondents No. 2 and 3, the Petitioners, having no other option, offered to sell their shares to the Respondents No. 2 and 3 at a fair value, which was most unreasonably declined by the Respondents No. 2 and 3; that as a result of the Respondents’ malafide/motivated refusal to buy the shares of the Petitioners, the Petitioners found themselves in the most undesirable position with their 20% shares being stuck in the Company (there being restrictions of share transfer incorporated in the Articles of Association), while they are being totally excluded from participating in the management of the Company, the Petitioner No. 1 having been dismissed as MD and the Petitioners being out voted at every board meeting by the father-son duo, the Respondents No. 2 and 3, the controlling  majority. In addition, the Respondents No. 2 and 3 have stopped the Petitioner No. 1’s fuel allowance and his mobile phone allowance; that even though the Petitioners were minority shareholders, holding no more than 20% of the issued shares, the Company was run as a quasi-partnership Company, that is,  it was run on the basis of mutual confidence and a personal relationship between the Petitioners and Respondent Nos. 2 and 3. There existed an implied understanding between and amongst all the shareholders that, no matter how meager their shareholding was, they shall all be involved in the management of the Company and out of that understanding arose a legitimate expectation on the part of the Petitioners to participate in the management; that it is submitted that section 233 of the Act confers on the court wide powers to grant relief appropriate relief to minority shareholders whose interests have been or is likely to be prejudicially affected by the manner in which the affairs of the Company are being conducted or the powers of the directors are being exercised.<br/> <br/>The petitioner has also submitted a supplementary affidavit, sworn on 28.1.2014, and at paragraph No.5, stated  that the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 have made a huge cash withdrawals each exceeding and out of Tk. 5,00000/- from the bank account of the respondent No.1 company, maintained the City Bank Ltd, for the purposes which could not be  traced and particulars of the said withdrawals and that the statement of account reveals a shocking scenario where the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 have made huge cash withdrawals, each exceeding an amount of Tk. 5, 00,000/- from the account for purposes which cannot be traced.

The petitioners, who continue to be directors of the Company, have never received any notice of any meeting having an agenda for approving withdrawal and expenditure if such huge amounts in cash, which is extraordinarily to say  the least. The petitioner, the minority shareholders , have no way of knowing or verifying the true purposes for which such withdrawals were made from the account of the Company. Such withdrawals clearly show that the affairs of the Company are being conducted and its powers are being exercised in a manner which is prejudicial to the petitioners as members of the Company and in disregard of their interests. It is clear that the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 have acted in manner which has discriminated the interest of the petitioners as members of the Company. The above factual development has only served to justify the petitioners’ apprehension that the majority were likely to act in a manner which would discriminate against them. There has been a complete and total breakdown of mutual trust and confidence, which cannot be restored, and the petitioner is therefore in law and equity entitled to the reliefs prayed for.<br/> <br/>The respondents have appeared in this case and submitted affidavit-in-opposition denying all material allegations and further stating in a supplementary affidavit, sworn on 30.9.2013; that when the Petitioners were in full control of the company, although all the machineries were imported in time and the power plant was constructed, still the Petitioners delayed in getting the plant in operation and due to this late production the company had to pay an amount of Tk. 40,12,64,009/- to BPDB as liquidated damage; that during the tenure of the Petitioner No. 1 as the Managing Director of the company, he was involved in various activities which caused huge loss to the company. In the said process Bangla Cad has supplied inferior quality rubber pads from the local market instead of the original specifications provided by Catterpillar and the Petitioner No. 1 has accepted the said products and as a result the rubber pads could not absolve the vibrations of the machines and hence 93, out of 96, machines cracked at its base. After the crackdown, the company sent the said rubber pads to BUET for testing and on 18.09.2013 BUET certified the rubber pads were of inferior quality.<br/> <br/>The learned Mr. Akhtar Imam,  appearing alongwith the learned Advocates Ms. Rashna Imam and Rashed Imam, having placed the petition alongwith the documents annexed, first of all submits that admittedly the respondent No.1 company  was incorporated, on 23.08.2005, with 4 promoter share holders, namely Md. Jahangir Alam, Mrs. Tasneem Sultana, Nuher Latif Khan (petitioner no.1) and Ms. Shaphar Shaba (petitioner No.2), each equally holding 25,0000 (twenty five thousand) shares in the company. Subsequently, the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 have acquired the shares of Md. Jahangir Alam and Mrs.Tasneem Sultana by way of transfer. Thereafter further shares were allotted and at the time of filling of this petition the respondent No.2 is holding, 3,75,000 shares and the respondent No.3 is holding 25,000 (twenty five) thousand shares, while the petitioner No.1 is holding 50,000 (Fifty thousand) shares and petitioner No.2 is holding 50,000 (Fifty thousand) shares. As such, at present the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 are jointly holding 80% shares in the company, whereas the petitioners jointly hold 20% shares in the company, each of them holding 10% of the total paid up shares. He also submits that at the time of incorporation of the company, the petitioner No.1 was the Managing Director (MD) as a technical expert in the matter of installing power plant and he, along with other promoter share holders, has incorporate the respondent No.1 company. Subsequently the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 entered into the company by purchasing the shares of two other promoters. However, the respondent No.2 did not disturb functioning of the petitioner No.1 as the managing director and did not express his mind or  his ulterior motive to oust the petitioner No.1 from the office of the Managing Director, as he was waiting for an opportune moment to outs the petitioners and thereby to usurp the entire power,  control  management of the company. The learned Advocate also submits that the respondent No.2, although holder of 75%  shares, he, however, behave very discretely  in order to keep the petitioner in comfort, at the initial stage, and thereby secured trust and confidence of the petitioners to house the office of the respondent No.1 company in the premises of the Mohammadi Group,  owned by the respondent No.1 and staffed by his own persons. Besides, all the senior executives, controlling the financial affairs of Mohammadi Group, were also controlling the financial affairs of respondent No.1 company. At the inception and owing to a managed cordial relationship between the parties, the petitioner did not suspect anything wrong in running the affairs of the company in that way. However, the company has went into commercial production during the tenure of the petitioner, working as the Managing Director of the company. But he continues, subsequently the petitioner has begun to exercise his power and advantage our share holding position phase by phase.  He also submits that originally the Bank accounts of the company was being jointly operated by the respondent No.2 as the Chairman and the petitioner No.1 as the Managing Director, but subsequently by a resolution dated 17.4.2013, annexure-23(B), the office of the Managing Director has been taken away from petitioner No.1 and the respondent No.3 (son of the respondent No.2 and holder of 5% hares) was appointed as the Managing Director vide agenda No.1, of the EGM held on 17.4.2013. Beside it has also been resolved, vide agenda no.3, of the Board meeting dated 23.3.2013 (Annexure-X) that the respondent No.2 shall operate the bank account as mandatory signatory along with the joint signature of any one of the 3(three) other directors and thereby practically excluded the petitioners from operating the bank account inasmuch as the respondent No.1, as  the mandatory signatory, have been operating the bank account since then under the signature of himself and respondent No.3 (his son). The learned Advocate further submits that although  section 110 (1) of the Companies Act, provides that  the tenure of the Managing Director shall be for a period of 5 years, however, sub-section (3) of section 110 provides that the initial tenure of the M.D. can be renewed, in the general meeting, for further period of 5 years and the respondent Nos. 2 and 3, holder of 80% shares, ought to have to exercised their voting right, in order to re-appoint the petitioner No.1 as the Managing Director for further period of 5 years as he was eligible as an expert in the field  of business of respondent No.1 company and he was the founder Managing Director. Instead, the respondent No.2, holder of 75% shares, with the support of his son (holder of 5% shares), have discharged him from the office of the M.D and appointed the respondent No.3 as the M.D, vide a resolution dated 17.4.2013, adopted in an EGM that was held to implement the decision taken in the Board Meeting dated 23.3.2013, vide Annexures-23(B) and Annexure-X. As such, by way of exercising the position of 80% holder of the shares, the Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 have gradually captured, seized and usurped the entire financial control and management of the company, as a intruder, by purchasing out two original promoter share holders and appropr-iated the entire profit and fortune of the respondent No.1 company having a huge marketing opportunity in the energy sector. Next, referring to Annexure-Z, which is statement of accounts of the City Bank Limited (showing accounting position since 19.1.2013 to 19.1.2014), he submits that after obtaining the power to run and operate the bank account, by the aforesaid board resolution dated 23.3.2013, the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 have removed a huge amount of money as stated in paragraph number 5 of the supplementary affidavit and that totally stands at Tk. 4,92,59,181.00 and there is no trace where and how  this amount has gone or used. He also submits that in order to show who are the real persons in fact, managing and controlling the financial affairs of the company, this court has directed the respondents to submit certain documents, but they have not complied with the court’s order by suppressing the documents called for and instead filed certain documents which have no relevance to the documents called for by this court. He next submits that the petitioner No.1, no doubt, have signed several documents and agreements, but all these documents and agreements were signed  with approval of the board of directors in which the respondent Nos.2 and 3 were holding majority shares and have full control. As such, he adds, not a single piece of document was signed nor any decision was ever taken by the petitioner No.1 or 2 without the desire, instruction, consent and approval of the majority share holders, namely the respondent No.2 and 3. Besides, the learned advocate continues, the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 are not only the majority share holders exercising majority voting right in general meeting, but the respondent No.2 being the Chairman also had a casting vote in order to mould any decision taking in any general meeting (AGM/EGM) of the company. As such, it as stated in their affidavits in opposition, it is not at all correct that the petitioner No.1 has solely  run and managed  the affairs of the company during his tenure as Managing Director. Rather it was the Board of Directors, subject to whose control and decision, the petitioner No.1 had acted. Such kind of statement made by the said respondents is not only misleading but  also a travesty of truth. He then submits that there are a lot of materials on record to show that the relationship between the petitioners and the respondents No.2 and 3 have come to a state of total dead lock. None of the petitioners are either in a position to participate in the management of the affairs of the company, nor they have any authority or control over the financial affairs or in operating the bank accounts of the company. As such, the learned advocate concludes, that the conduct of the Respondent numbers 2 and 3 is evidently prejudicial to the interest of the petitioners, discriminatory to the interest of the petitioners, amounts to denial of the legitimate expectation of the petitioners and unfairly oppressive. Hence, the learned advocate prays that it is a fit case where the direction should be given upon the respondents to buy out  the petitioners and to relive them of all personal guarantees/ securities, as prayed for. In support of his contention the learned Advocate has referred to the cases reported in 7 BLC (HCD) 107: Homera Ahmed Vs. Nahar Shipping Lines,  56 DLR(AD) page 36: Nahar Shipping Lines Ltd Vs. Homera Ahmed &amp; ors, 53 DLR (AD) (2001)83:  Syed Al Nesar Ahmed, MD, United Food Complex Ltd. Vs. Nafisa Choudhury and others, 11 BLC (AD) (2006) page 67: HBS Association Private Limited and others Vs. Professor Shahabuddin Khaled Chowdhury and  the case of Re, Westbourne Galleries Ltd., (1972) 2 All ER 492 (HL). He finally submits that in the case reported in 7 BLC 107,  affirmed by the Appellate Division in  56 DLR (AD)  36, direction upon the respondents were given to purchase jointly or severally  all shares of the petitioners (the minority share holders) and there was bank loan in that case. But,  no difficulty, nor of any lack of power in this court, arose in passing the direction inspite of there being bank loan obtained by the respondent company, as obtained in the present case. Besides in this case,  all the lenders  have been made parties as respondents Nos.5 and 6, as per court’s order dated 27.5.2013, but they have neither appeared, nor opposed the prayer made in the petition. Besides, he emphatically submits that once the petitioners’ shares are bought out by the respondents there is no  justification in law that they should not be absolved from their personal guarantees inasmuch as they will have no say, no profit, nor any stake in the business of respondent No.1 company. Hence, the mere fact that the company has debt and liability to the banks is not a bar in passing the direction to purchase the shares of the petitioners and in relinquishing them from all personal liabilities as prayed for in the petition.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocates Mr. Mohammad Mehedi Hasan Chowdhury and Mr. Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, with learned advocates Mr, A. K. M.Rabiul Hassan, Mr. Mohammed Selim Jahangir and Mr. Apurba Kumar Biswas, on the other hand, submits that the petitioner number.1 was the Managing Director of the company till he was relived of his office by resolution adopted on 17.4.2013 in an EGM, Annexure-23(B). The petitioners have filed this petition on 16.4.2013, that before the said resolution was adopted in the EGM. Hence, at the time of filing this petition there was no cause of action. He next submits that during his tenure, the petitioner number.1 has left the company at a huge loss because of his mismanagement. The petitioner even did not claim damages for supply of faulty machineries by the suppliers, inspite of his raising objection about the supply. In the result the company had to pay an amount of Tk.40,00000/- (forty lac) to BPDB on account of demurrage. He also submits that there was lot of unexplained expenditure incurred during the tenure of the petitioner No.1 as Managing Director as well. As such, it cannot be ground that the respondent No.2 and 3 have allowed certain expenditure exgratia or that there is lacing proper explanation as regards these expenditure. In fact the petitioners have filed this petition with collateral purpose to relive themselves of the financial liability as guarantors to the bank which they are obliged to discharge since the company has incurred a huge loss during tenure of the petitioner No.1. He submits that the respondents also relies on the decisions cited on behalf of  the petitioners, but in those case the respondents have succeeded in showing that there was prejudicial acts done by the majority shareholders. But, in the instant case the petitioners have utterly failed to show that any prejudicial acts or conducts were done by the respondents. Hence the decision cited by the petitioners are liable to be disguished and are not applicable in the facts of the present case. He also submits that the petitioners are existing members of the board of direction and they could participate in the board meeting in taking decisions by the board of directors. As such, he concludes, the petition has no merit, no case under section 233 has been made out and the petition is liable to be  dismissed.<br/> <br/>I have heard the learned Advocates,  perused the petition and the affidavit in opposition along with the supplementary affidavits filed by both sides. I have also taken into consideration all the documents and materials on record.<br/> <br/>It appears from the record that the respondent No.1 company was promoted by 4 share holders, each holding 25000 shares, of which 2(two) are the petitioners and the rest 2(two) are one Jahangir Alam and another Mrs. Tasneem Sultana. The company was incorporated on 23.08.2005. The respondent Nos. 2 and 3 have acquired shares of of Jahanjir Alam and Tasneem, by purchase, on 23.8.2005. As such, the respondents No. 2 and 3, each were holding 25,000 (twenty-five thousand) shares as transferee. Subsequently, further 4 (four lac) shares were allotted, of which the respondent No.2 received 3,50,000 shares,  the petitioner No.1 received 25,000 shares  and petitioner No.2 received 25,000 (twenty five thousand) shares. As such, at the time of filling of this petition, the share holding position of respondent Nos. 2 and 3  is 3, 75,000 and 25,000 respectively, while the share holding position of petitioner No.1 is 50,000/- and petitioner No.2 is 50,000/-. In other words, respondent No.2 is holding 75% shares and respondent No.3 is holding 5% shares. Thus the respondents No. 2 and 3 are jointly holding 80% shares as at the date of filing of this petition, whereas the petitioners are holding 20% as at the date of filing of this petition. As such I find that the petitioners have locus standi to file this petition.<br/> <br/>I have also considered the board resolution dated 23.3.2013 (annexure-X) to the supplementary affidavit dated 14.11.2013, filed by the petitioner. From agenda No.4, it appears that Mr. Anisul Haq (respondent No. 2) had proposed that the petitioner No. 1 (Mr. Nuher L. Khan) should officially handover the position and responsibility of the Managing Director (M.D.) to Mr. Anisul Haq and respondent No. 3 (his son) has supported the proposal. But, both the petitioners declined. Howecer, there was a tie, but the chairman Mr. Anisul Haq (respondent No. 2) did not have any casting vote as chairman of the board meeting. So, it was decided that this issue should be resolved in the EGM to be called and hold, as authorized by Article 27 of the Articles of Association (AOA) of the company. Accordingly, in the EGM dated 17.4.2013 [Annexure-23(B) to the Supplementary Affidavit, sworn on 12.2.14, by the respondents Nos. 2 and 3], the company has adopted a resolution discharging the petitioner No. 1 from the office of M.D. and appointed Mr. Navidul Haq as M.D., in furtherance of the decision taken in Board Meeting dated 23.03.2013 (Annexure-X). This conduct alone establishes a case for granting relief under section 233 of the Act. This also renders neguatory the submission that this petition has been filed before the cause of action had arisen, as advanced by the learned advocate for the petition. Because, the resolution dated 17.4.2013 [Annexure-23(B), reliving the petitioner from the office of the M.D is, in deed, is continuation of the resolution taken against agenda No. 4 in the Board Meeting dated 23.03.2013 (Annexure-X) and the cuase of action arose on 23.03.2013. Besides, in my considered view, any court of law can take into consideration the subsequent events, like the EGM resolution dated 27.4.2013, for resolving the disputes completely and efficaciously, and there is authority supporting this view. Besides, the excuses that the petitioner No. 1 was liable to be discharged as per provision of section 110(1) of the Act, is nothing but a contrivance to implement the decision taken against agenda No. 4 of the Board meeting dated 23.04.2013, because section 110(3) of the Act permits extension of the tenure of the M.D., i.e. the petitioner No. 1 in this case, for further period of five years, and the respondents No. 2 and 3 could have exercised their 80% voting right, in EGM dated 17.4.2013, to extend the tenure of the petitioner No. 1 (founder M.D) for further five years, if these respondent were fair and were committed to uphold the legitimate expectation of the petitioner (the promoter share holders). Similarly, from the same motive, these respondents No. 2 and 3 have technically ousted the petitioners from operating the bank account, by adopting a resolution that the account shall be operated under joint signature of the respondent No. 2 (chairman), as the mandatory signatory, with any one of the three other directors, of whom one is respondent No. 3 and the rest two are the petitioners (as mere name leaders), thereby it has been ensured that the respondent No. 2 and 3 can very well operate bank account, under their joint signature, excluding the petitioners. In this context, I should refer to the ratio of the case reported in 11 BLC (author  Judge Mr. Justice Md. Tofazzal Islam, as his Lord ship then was) (AD) 67 : HBS Association (Pvt) Ltd Vs. Prof. S.K. Chowdhury, wherein it has been held by the apex court (at paragraph 31) ‘that in the instant case the respondent No.1 was a director as well as a joint signatory for operating the bank accounts of the company and had legitimate expectation to remain as such and more over his investment in the Company has been stuck off because of his removal from directorship of the company and no opportunity at all was given to the respondent No.1 to remove his capital upon reasonable terms and, as under section 233, the court in a fit case may pass appropriate order and accordingly the High Court Division gave direction upon appellant No.2 and 3 to purchase the shares of the respondents No.1” In the instant case, the petitioners were not removed as directors, but in consequence of the above said resolution they existed as directors in paper only, having no say in any decision making process. Though it may not be necessary to unearth the motive in so doing, however it seems that the majority share holders (the respondent No.2 and 3) might have thought to keep the petitioners bundled with the entire liability of the company jointly and severally alongwith the respondent No.2 and 3, for loan liability of the company, although the petitioners have no equal stake, and no say at all, in managing the business, financial or other affairs of the company or in operating the bank account of the company. May be, the respondents wanted giving a sugar coat over their unfair, prejudicial and discriminatory deeds and conducts or to put a façade of fairness to disguise their oppressive and discriminatory conduct.<br/> <br/>Next, I should refer to the ratio of the case reported in 7 BLC 107: Homera Ahmed Vs. Nahar Shipping Lines Ltd. [another Judge Mr. Justice K.M. Hasan, as his Lordship then was]. In that case, at paragraph 73, the High Court Division has held that “As a matter of law the petitioners are entitled to have a say in running and management of the company. Further, as a matter of law, the failure on the part of the majority to give the petitioner a say in running and management of the company is prejudicial conduct under section 233…… As a result, the prejudice suffered by the petitioners is that they were “locked out” of the company within which the investment was locked in. They can neither take out their investment nor participate in the affairs of the company.” Accordingly, in that case, the High Court Division allowed the petition and jointly or severally directed the majority shareholders to purchase, jointly or severally, all shares of the minority. That judgment passed in Matter No.151 of 1997, reported in 7 BLC 109, was upheld by the Appellate Division in the case reported in 56 DLR (AD) 36 (i.e. in CPLA No. 1382 of 2002 arose out of Matter No.151 of 1997) .<br/> <br/>In the facts of this case, it is also pertinent to quote views of the apex court; expressed in para 31 and 32 of the case reported in 11 BLC (AD) 67, that reads as follows<br/>“31. In the instant case the respondent No. 1, who was a director as well as a joint signatory for operating the bank accounts of the company, also had a legitimate expectation to remain as such and moreover, his investment in the company has been struck off because of his removal from directorship of given to the respondent No. 1 to remove his capital upon reasonable terms and, as under section 233, the court in a fit case may pass appropriate order and accordingly, the High Court Division gave direction upon the appellant Nos. 2 and 3 to purchase the shares of the respondent No. 1.<br/>32. We are of the view that on correct appreciation of the materials on record the High Court Division gave the above direction and we find no cogent reason to interfere with the same.”<br/> <br/>Having consulted the ratio of the case settled, by the apex court, in the case reported in 56 DLR (AD)36: Nahar Shipping Lines Vs. Homera Ahmed  and in the case reported in 11 BLC (AD)67: HBS Association (Pvt) Ltd Vs. Professor Shahabuddin Khaled Chowdhury vis-a-vis the facts and circumstances of the instant matter, I am of the considered view that this an apt case where relief should be given, as prayed for, under section 233 of the Act.<br/> <br/>Similarly, the views taken in 53 DLR (AD) 83: Sayed AL Naser Ahmed Vs. Nafisa Chowdhury and in Re, Westbourne Gallerin Ltd. (1972) 2 ALLER 422 (H2) squarely supports giving reliefs prayed for in the facts and circumstances of this case. In 53 DLR (AD) 83, the apex court has held that, a minority share holder can petition the court for relief (1) if there has been fundamental breach rules, (2) where the majority endeavoring directly or indirectly to appropriate to themselves or (3) money, property or advantages which belonged to the company or in which the other members are entitled to participate or (3) if the court is of opinion that the interest of the applicant is being or is likely to be prejudicially affected for reasons given in the petition, the court may make such order as prayed for or such other order as it deems fit.<br/> <br/>As regards legitimate expectation, the respondents had relied on a judgment reported on 3 NLJ 130: Sunglary Apparel Ltd Vs. BCBL. In that case, it was held in the facts of that case, that the doctrine of legitimate expect-ation is not applicable in company matter. In that case, a share holder claimed that he has right to share that remained unsubscribed. The court held that the shares were allotted pursuant to section 155 of the Act and the unsubscribed shares, if  any, shall remain under the disposal of the board of directors, for allotment in the manner, as laid down in that section and keeping in view the paramount interest of the company. The petitioner, who had subscribed for the proportionate shares allotted to him, had no legitimate right to get the unsubscribed shares allotted to him. Hence, that case is liable to be distinguished in the facts of this case. Here, the principle of the case, as regards legitimate expectation by minority shares holders, laid down in 11 BLC (AD) 67 will apply.<br/> <br/>Similarly, the pretense or excuse, recorded in EGM resolution dated 17.04.2013, that the petitioners are share holder in another company formed with object to do similar business, simply highlight the motive of the respondents to capture any issue, whatsoever, to oust the petitioner and to usurp the entire control of the company keeping the petitioners existence only in paper, so that they can be saddled with an victimize for the loan liability of the company of which the respondent No.2 and 3, are in substance, proprietors as evident from the facts and circumstances of this case.   <br/> <br/>In the facts and circumstances of this case I find that since after 23.3.2013, the date of adopting board resolution (vide Annexure-X), the petitioner had no say in running or managing the affairs of the company as well as they have no say in operating the bank account of the company. On the other hand they can not  go out with their stake in the company by transferring shares to an outsider, because, the respondent Nos. 2 and 3, using and exercising enormous power and having 100% control over the affairs of the company, no outsider is expected to come forward to purchase the shares of the petitioners, as has been rightly pointed out and  submitted by the learned Advocate for the petitioners.<br/> <br/>In this view of the matter, I find that the ratio of the cases cited by the learned Advocate for the petitioners, referred to in the course of his submission and quoted herein above, is squarely applicable in the facts and circumst-ances of this case and a clear case has been made out by the petitioners to pass the relief as prayed for in the petition.<br/> <br/>The Appellate Division in, appropriate case, has directed to purchase the minority shares, although the company had bank liability. In this case as well the respondents  could not cite any  decision to the contrary to take a view that merely because the company has bank loan and the petitioners have executed some personal guarantee, as alleged, their shares cannot be transferred pursuant to this court’s order.<br/> <br/>In my considered opinion, section 27(1)(a) of the Bank Companies Act, 1991, requires permission of a lender bank in the case of transfer of shares to be made voluntarily by the share holder of a borrower company and in the case of voluntary resignation tendered by the directors of a borrower company pursuant to their own decision. In this case, the transfer of shares is to be made pursuant judgment and order passed as per provisions of section 233 of the Act and relinquishment of the liability of the petitioners arises pursuant to the court’s order passed section 233 of the Act.<br/> <br/>Hence, the bar provided in section 27(a) of the Bank Companies Act is not applicable in the matter of transferring of the shares pursuant to court’s order passed under section 233 of the Act or in the matter of a consequent resignation or vacation of office pursuant to order passed under section 233. Besides, when entire shares of the petitioners are transferred to the respondents then the petitioners have no stake in the company and there is no reason to saddle them with liability of the company in running and managing which they have no say, nor do they have any right to claim any interest in the profit. So, they will have no personal liability for the loan of a company after their relation with the company has been perpetually served. There is no reason to keep their personal guarantee alive in such circumstances. Hence, a direction upon the bank shall be made to relinquish the petitioners from their personal guarantees as well.<br/> <br/>In view of the deliberation recorded above I find merit in this petition and the petition is allowed.<br/>Accordingly, it is directed that,</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">the company or the respondents No. 2 shall request Hodavasi Chowdhury &amp; Co., Chartered Accountants, BTMC Bhaban, Karwan Bazar, Dhaka, to make valuation of the shares and to submit their report.

Rezaul Hasan, J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This is an application under section 241 read with section 245  of the Companies Act, 1994 (the Act) for winding up of the respondent No.2 company, namely Jamuna Bashundhara Housing Development Limited, herein after referred as ‘the company’.<br/> <br/>Facts, in brief, leading to filing of this application and as stated therein are that the petitioner Nos.1 to 5 are members of same family. The petitioner Nos.1 to 5 represent the most renowned and prestigious business house of the country, namely-Bashundhara Group; that the respondent No.1 is Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms. The respondent No.2 is Jamuna Bashundara Housing Development Ltd. The respondent No.3 to 7 are members of same family. The respondent No.8 is Banker of the respondent No.2 company; that the respondent No.2 company was incorporated in the year 2009 with the objects to carry on businesses, inter alia, of real estate, construction, housing, apartment project and housing facilities, developing land by earth filling and also by preparing layout for plots and selling those plots at home and at abroad. Certified copy of the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the respondent No.2 has been annexed to the petition as Annexure-A; that because of the wide spread reputation of Bashundhara Group, the respondent Nos. 3 to 7 approached the petitioners to establish a joint venture company. The petitioners, as a bona fide gesture, accepted their proposal. Since, two business groups have established the respondent No. 2 company, Article 4 classifies the petitioner Nos. 1 to 5 as Group-B share-holders, and the respondent Nos. 3 to 7, on the other hand, as Group-A share-holders, each group shall hold 50% of the total subscribed shares. Accordingly, both groups have formed respondent No. 2 Company under the name and style “Jamuna Bashundhar Housing Development Ltd (‘the company’ in brief). Articles 4 and 7 of the Articles of Association reads as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/>“4. Group of share holders:-<br/>The share of the company is comprised of Group “A” and Group “B” shares. The shares of both the groups have the same status. The Group has been made for identification purpose of the shareholders as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Group-A</strong><br/>The following shareholders will be Group “A” shareholders:<br/>Md. Shamim Islam<br/>Mrs. Salma Islam<br/>Shariat Tasreen<br/>Monika Nazneen Islam<br/>Sumaiya Islam<br/><br/><strong>Group-B</strong><br/>The following shareholders will be Group “B” shareholders:<br/>Sayem Sobhan<br/>Mrs. Aforza Begum<br/>Sadat Sobhan<br/>Safiat Sobhan<br/>Safwan Sobhan<br/> <br/>7. The share in the Company shall be held by the following group of shareholders:<br/>Group- “A”: 50%<br/>Group- “B”: 50%<br/>7.1 The shares shall be under the disposal and control of the Board of Directors.<br/>7.2 Any issue of further or new shares at any shall be made in such manner so as to preserve and maintain the respective percentage set out in Article 4.1. above;” that in the management of the respondent No.2 company, i.e in the board of directors, each group maintains equal strength. Article 39 states that each group shall represent five directors in the board of directors. Article 49 of the Articles of Association provides that at least two directors from each group shall constitute quorum in the board of directors, Articles 39, 48 and 49 of the Articles of Association is quoted below:<br/>“39. The member of Directors of the company shall be ten. Each group shall represent five directors.<br/>48. No business shall be transacted at any meeting of the Board unless a quorum is present when the meeting proceeds to business.<br/>49. 4(four) directors at least two from each group present personally will form the quorum for transaction of business at a meeting of the Board of Directors. All questions arising at any meeting of Directors shall be decided by majority of votes.”;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>that the respondent No.2 company collected money from various persons for allotting plots. But due to mismanagement and reluctance of Group-A directors, the respondent No.2 company could not acquire enough land to allot to the persons from whom the respondent No.2 company collected installments. Due to irresponsible attitude of respondent Nos.3 to 7, the petitioners’ other companies and Bashundhara Group, which the petitioners represent, have been earning bad name. The respondent No.2 company is in total stand still situation. The respondent Nos.3 to 5 who are 50% shareholders and hold equal strength in the board and in the company is not cooperating to carry on the smooth business of the respondent No.2 company. There is no likelyhood that the respondent No.2 shall regain its business. Hence, for the better interest of all concerned, the petitioners have filed this application for winding up of the respondent No.2 company. Considering all the facts and circumstances of the case, this Court maybe pleased to consider that winding up of the respondent NO.2 company is just and equitable; that the respondent No.2 company maintains two accounts with the respondent No.8 bank. The accounts are current Deposit Account being Account No.02333000379 and Short Notice Deposit Account being Account No.02336000047. The balance as on 18.06.2012 in Current Deposit Account No.02333000379 stands at Tk.7,02,507.50. The balance in other account being Short Notice Deposit No.02336000047 as on 18.06.2012 stands on Tk.55,60,36,100.32. The petitioners and the respondent Nos.3 to 7 withdrew Tk.31 crore each. The petitioners intends to refund the said amount of Tk.31 crore to the respondent No.2 company as and when the liquidator directs, if any, is appointed in the instant case; that the respondent NO.2 company only acquired 20.3562 acres of land in various <em>mouzas</em>. The description of the said lands are narrated in details in the schedule of land below; that certain clients of the company declined to receive plots from the said company and rather requested the company to transfer the amount already deposited to the respondent No.9 company. The letters of such clients of the company have been annexed to the petition as  Annexures “D” series; that apart, the respondent No.2 company is not doing any business, the respondent No. 2 company never held the statutory meeting, neither has held any AGMs as yet. Therefore, on this account as well this Court may be pleased to winding up the respondent No.2 company. Hence this application for winding up of the company.<br/>The respondent Nos.3-7 have appeared in this matter and filed an affidavit-in-opposition denying all the material allegations made in the petition and further stating, amongst other, that the real facts of the case are that Jamuna Group is a leading company of Bangladesh engaged into the business of spinning, weaving, garments manufacturing, electronics, distillery, housing development and construction of real estate building etc. Jamuna Future Park is one of the biggest shopping mall of Asia, which is an excellent and noble works of Jamuna Group. Bashundhara Group is also a leading company engaged into the business of housing development, construction, ship building, steel engineering etc; both of them have a very strong economic background and logistic supports in their respective fields of business. In the year 2006, the founders of two groups i.e Mr. Md. Nurul Islam alias Babul, Chairman of Jamuna Group and Mr. Ahmed Akbar Sobhan alias Shah Alam, Chairman of Bashundhara Group met in a friendship meeting and decided to start a joint venture housing project by amalgamating their respective lands lying in the project area nearby the 300 feet wide ‘Dhaka-Purbachal Road’, the project comprising about 2000 bighas of land of Dumni Mastul, Bauther, Barua, Barokau and Delna etc <em>Mouzas</em>. They also agreed to surrender their respective lands lying in their respective project. Consequently, they have entered into a Deed of Agreement on 17.10.2006, bearing Deed No.23549 dated 17.10.2006 registered with the Sub-Registry Office, Gulshan Dhaka. The project was initially proposed in the name and style of “NB Agricultures Ltd” (Jamuna Bashundhara Agricultures Ltd) in view of clause 5 of the Deed of the said Agreement. The project comprising of the same area of land were re-named as “Jamuna-Bashundhara Housing Development Ltd” and the project proposal was materialized by establishment of a company under the name and style of Jamuna-Bashundhara Housing Development Ltd (respondent No. 2), comprising the sand land of JB Agriculture Ltd and lay out plan was prepared for the self-same land in the name of Jamuna-Bashundhara Housing Development Ltd instead of JB Agriculture Ltd. The company was registered with the office of the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms Bangladesh, having registration No. C-77178 dated 10.05.2009; that the petitioner No.1 is authorized by the Articles of Association of the company for holding AGM or Board Meeting etc and he has taken a lot of signatures from the respondent No.3 regarding Board Meeting from time to time for opening Bank account and for business transactions and issuance of cheques for withdrawal of money from the Bank from time to time. A lot of properties have been procured at the instance of the petitioner No.1 in the name of the company and the grounds taken in the petition are not cogent grounds for winding up and as such the petition is liable to be rejected; that the parties to the agreement were agreed to transfer their respective lands to the project and accordingly Bank account was opened by taking the resolution of the Board of Directors and the Company maintains an account with the respondents No.8 in which there is a deposit of Tk.32.00 crores arising out of allotments of plots to 534 numbers of allotment holders. Besides, Jamuna Builders have 445 numbers of allotment holders, who will merge with the Joint Venture Project of Jamuna Bashundhara Housing Development Ltd. and the lands of the ‘Bashundhara Group’ and of the ‘Jamuna Group’ would be transferred to the project equally, against which Bashundharha Group has already taken a sum of Tk.31.00 crores from the common fund of the project and the Jamuana Group has also taken the same amount for giving equal lands to the project.<br/> <br/>Besides 4 sets of applications have been submitted in this matter, namely- (1) Aminur Rahman Khan and others, (2) Kazi Shakhawat Hossain and two others (3) Global Multipurpose Property Ltd. and 3 others (4) Md. Mossaraf Hossain. After hearing the applicants order has been passed to keep these applications on record.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Ahsanul Karim, appearing along with the learned Advocate Mr. Shamim Ahmed Mehedi, Mr. Khairul Alam Chowdhury and Mr. Md. Abu Taleb, Advocates, having placed the application and drawing my attention to other materials on record, firstly submits that there is a total dead lock in running and managing the affairs of the company and more so the share holder-directors are holding shares, in the company, in equal proportion. As a result, for lack of co-operation of respondent Nos.3-7 a total dead lock has been created in convening or holding the meetings of the board of directors or the general meeting or to take any decision to run the business of the company. Next, referring to Article 39, 48 and 49 of the Articles of Association, the learned Advocate submits that since the directors of Group-A are not attending the board meetings, so for lack of quorum as well for lack of majority in taking decision for want of support of the respondent Nos. 3-7 (Ground-A share holders) all affairs of the company now stands still and there is no hope to overcome this prevailing situation, as would be evident from paragraph No.10(e) of the affidavit-in-opposition wherein the respondent Nos.3-7 have also expressed their intention to buy off the shares of the petitioners instead of offering any concrete proposal or practical solution to overcome the dead lock. As such, the company has failed to proceed towards achieving any of its objects and there is a practical uncertainty that the company would at all be able to be run and be managed by these two groups of directors/share holders, holding equal shares and voting rights and having lack of trust or support between them, so that the objects for which the company has been formed can be actualized. Then, referring to paragraph No.7 of the petition, the learned Advocate submits that each group of directors/ share holders have withdrawn Tk.31,00,00,000/- (Tk.62,0000000/- in total) from the accounts of the respondent No. 2 company and this position has also been admitted by the petitioner as well as by the respondent Nos.3-7 in their affidavit-in-opposition. The learned Advocate continues that no dividend was recommended by the board of directors nor any divided was approved in any Annual General Meeting of the company and such withdrawal of money, by both group of directors alone is a ground that it will be just and equitable to wind up the company before it falls into further financil and management disaster to the great prejudice of the persons who have made applications and paid several installments to purchase plots from the respondent No. 2 Company. Although, he further submits, the petitioners have made clear promise, at paragraph No.7 of the petition, that they are willing to refund Tk.31,00,00,000/- to the account of respondent No.2 company as and when the liquidator directs, if any, appointed in the instant case, but the respondent Nos.3-7 (Group-A directors), although admitted to have received the same amount of money, vide their affidavit-in-opposition, but they did not make any such commitment to refund this amount of the money to the company, which is the money of the company and forming part of assets of the company. Hence, it reveals a clear risk to continue business with group-A share-holders and the group-B share-holders are not willing to expose themselves to the risk of misuse of the allottees money or of their own equity. The learned advocate also submits that, there exists a clear distrust in the mind of group-B share-holders as to whether they would take further risk by executing personal guarantees and/or by mortgaging their personal properties. The group-B share-holders apprehends loss of their good will as well, in continuing business with group-A share-holders. He strenuously submits that these kind of conducts has already frustrated the object for which the company has been formed and, as such, the company has, meantime, lost its substratum. Next, referring to the Annexures, particularly to those submitted alongwith the affidavit-in-opposition, the learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that these are not title deeds showing that the company has purchased any properties towards achieving its objects or for which it has received a huge amounts of money from the allottees. The <em>mouza</em> map or project plan etc, annexed to the affidavit-in-opposition, are not title deeds. Nor, he continues, any title deed could be annexed, to the affidavit-in-opposition to show that the company has allotted any plots to any of the allottees, although the company has been incorporate long back in the year 2009. As such it is evident that the company is not doing any business. The learned Advocate for the petitioner next submits that, mere operation of the Bank Account, either before or after presentation of the application, does not mean that the company is doing business in as much as the company has various obligations to several parties, either to pay or to deposit monies and for that purpose the Bank Account can and should remain operative, but this fact alone does not mean that the company is doing business. He submits that even a person, who is not a business, for instance a govern servant, can operate a bank account, but for operating a bank account it cannot be said that he is doing business thereby. The learned Advocate thereafter submits that, since both Group of Directors are holding equal shares i.e at 50: 50 ratio in the company, one group of directors-share holder cannot compel the other group to consent to the proposal placed before the board or in any other meeting or to remain present in any meeting to constitute quorum required to transact any business in any meeting or to cast their vote in order to adopt any resolution that essentially requires majority votes. Hence, the learned Advocate has insisted that this is a clear case of dead lock being created in running and managing the affairs of the company and unless, in such a situation, the company is wound up by the court the money of the allottees, held by and paid to the company, would not be able to be returned to them and these are still debt of the company owed to the allottees because no plots could have been transferred to them as yet and there is no certainty that the required quantity of land could be purchased by the company. In support of his contention the learned Advocate has referred to the 4(four) sets of petitions for addition of parties in which the allottees stated that they have paid crores of Taka for allotments of plots by several installments, but they doubt allotment of any plot can be made by the company and prayed for their addition as parties, so that they can get back their moneys as creditors of the company. This desire or agony of the allottees deserve serious consideration. He then submits that the company has not filed any statutory report as required under the provisions of section 83 of the Act and it is duty of all members of the Board of Directors to ensure compliance of the provisions of law. But, in this case, owing to non-co-operation of the ‘Group-A’ share-holder directors, no statutory report could be submitted, nor any AGM could be called or held till now. He then submits that although the Joint Venture agreement dated 17.10.2006 has been referred to in the affidavit-in-opposition, but none of the joint venture parties are share holders in the company (respondent No. 2) and as such the said joint venture agreement has no relevance and cannot be referred to or relied upon in the mater of winding up of the respondent No. 2 (company). Next, the learned Advocate has referred to paragraph No.24 and 32 of the case reported in 34 DLR(AD) 1982: Bengal Water ways vs. Rahimudden and submits that in view of the dead lock crated in running  and managing the affairs of the company and there being lack of confidence in each group holding equal number of shares in the company, it is desirable and expedient that the relationship should be ended. The respondents No.3-7 have proposed to buy off the shares of the petitioners and thereby they have expressed their clear intention not to continue the business together with the petitioners. Hence, there is no hope to break the dead lock. Besides, the respondent Nos. 3-7 having shown no intention to return Tk. 31 crore withdrawn from account of the company, in the manner aforesaid, there is no hope that this company would be able to achieve its objects, rather it has already deviated from the object for which it has been established and uncertainty in refunding monies of the allottees is apparently visible. In this situation, the learned advocate emphasizes that, it would be just and equitable to wind up the company by the court under section 241 clause (VI) of the Act, otherwise further prejudice to the allottees, to the company and to the petitioners cannot be prevented.<br/> <br/>The learned Counsel Mr. T.H.Khan appearing along with Mr. Fida M. Kamal and Mr. Md. Ziaul Haque, learned Advocates, on the other hand, having placed the affidavit-in-opposition and drawing my attention to the materials on record, submits that a mere perusal of the petition, filed by the petitioner, would show that no case for winding up has either been stated nor been made out in the petition. Then, categorically referring to clauses (1) to (VI) of section 241, of the Act, the learned Advocate for the respondent Nos.3-7 submits that none of the clauses is applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case stated in the petition or from the documents annexed therewith. Besides, the ground ‘just and equitable’ should be considered alongwith other grounds narrated in clause (I) to (V) of section 241 of the Act. Clause (VI), the learned advocate submits, empowering this court to pass an order of winding up on the ground of “just and equitable”, should not be considered by the court unless any of the other grounds, stated in clauses (I) to (V), is found to exists. While containing their submissions, the learned Advocate for the respondents has drawn my attention to the statement of accounts of Bank Asia, annexed to the affidavit-in-opposition as Annexure-III, and has shown that the bank account is being operated since 1.2.2009 and that it was operated on 15.7.2012 i.e before filing of the application and also on 5.8.2012 i.e. after filing this application as well. As such, the learned lawyer for the respondents, strenuously argued that it is not at all true that the company is not doing any business as alleged. Rather, instance of operation of the Bank Account before and after filing of this application clearly shows that the company is doing business and it is fully functional. Suppressing all these facts the petitioners have filed this application with malafide intention and, as such, this petition is liable to be rejected on this count alone. The learned Advocate for the respondents further submits that the company has received monies from several allottees and it should be allowed to perform its obligation by allowing it to continue as a going concern, so that the interest of the allottees is not prejudiced and that the company can survive as a going concern, particularly when there is a good prospect of this company doing real estate business. The learned Advocate for the respondents has also referred to the project plan and <em>Mouza</em> map which is to be acquired by the company for achieving its object i.e. for allotment of plots pursuant to the allotment letters issued to the several allottees. The learned Advocate further submits that it is duty of the petitioner No.1, who is the Managing Director, to call the Annual General Meeting or to submit the statutory report and in case of default, if any, it should be the responsibility of the petitioners for which the company should not be allowed to suffer or be ordered to be wound up. The learned Advocate for the petitioner, in conclusion, submits that clause (VI) of section 241 refers to the courts discretion or power to pass an order on the ground of ‘just and equitable’ and that this refers to equity as a ground for passing winding up order. Hence, in order to maintain the application under clause (VI) of section 241, the petitioner themselves should have come in clean hands. But the facts stated in the affidavit-in-opposition and as pointed out in the course of submissions clearly shows that the petitioners have not come in clean hands. On these grounds the learned advocate for respondents submits that this petition is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/>On query made from the Bench, the respondent sides has confirmed that both Group-A and Group-B directors/shares holders of the company, each has withdrawn Tk.31,00,00,000/- from the account of the company, although no dividend was declared by the Board or approved in any AGM and that this money is company’s money.<br/> <br/>Heard the learned Advocates, perused the petition filed under section 241 read with section 245 of the Act, the supplementary affidavit, the affidavit in opposition and the documents annexed thereto.<br/> <br/>Let the supplementary affidavits filed by the petitioner do form part of the substantive petition/application.<br/> <br/>I have taken for consideration, at first, as to whether clause (vi) of section 241 of the Act can be considered separately or independently of the clauses (I) to (V) of section 241of the Act as a ground for passing an order of winding up by the court, if the facts and circumstances of the case so justify. Then, having considered several authorities on this point I find that, it was one time held that the power to winding up under this clause (clause-vi) was a power only exercisable upon grounds of the same class as those specified in preceding clauses [Ref: Exparte Spackman, (1849) 1 Mac &amp; G170; Suburban Hotel Co. Re, (1867) 2 Ch App 737; Anglo-Greak Steam Co. Re, (1866) 2 EQ1]. But this view is not prevailed and the reasons for holding ‘just and equitable’ to winding up are not to be considered <em>ejusdem</em> <em>generis</em> with the reasons given in the preceding clauses of the section. In the case reported in In re Yenidje Tobacco Co. (1916) 2 Ch 426 Cozens Hardy, M.R., observed as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“It has been urged upon us that although it is admitted that the just and equitable clause is not to be limited to cases <em>ejusdem</em> <em>generis</em>, it has nevertheless been held, according  to the authorities, not to apply except where the substratum of the company has gone or where there is a complete deadlock. Those or two instances which are given, but I should be very sorry, so far as my individual opinion goes, to hold that they are strictly the limits of the ‘just and equitable’ clause, as found in the Companies Act. <u>I think that, in a case like this, we are bound to say that circumstances which would justify the winding-up of a partnership between these two by action are circumstances which would induce the court to exercise its jurisdiction under the ‘just and equitable’ clause and to wind-up the company</u>.” (underlining is mine)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the same case at page 435 Warrington, L.J., observed as follows, as regards the <em>ejusdem</em> <em>generic</em> rule; “That opinion (the opinion previously pre-veiling) has long been abandoned. These views have been confirmed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in a more recent judgment [Loch V. Johnblackwood, 1924 AC 783], in the course of which the authorities were carefully reviewed. This judgment is a very important and leading one ……….. <strong>.</strong> <u>It must therefore now be taken as established that the just and equitable clause confers upon the court a separate ground of  jurisdiction to make-up to winding-up order. The order under this clause rests upon the opinion of the Court to be formed on the circumstances of the case whereas the previous clauses each prescribe certain definite conditions and are quite different in character. The court will not be fettered in forming its opinion under this clause (i.e. clause-VI) by the necessity of finding the existence of facts analogous to those which constitute the previous grounds</u>. The aforesaid Privy Council case in Loch V. John Blackwood Ltd. 1924 A.C. 783, has been considered and followed in a recent case decided by the Supreme Court, vide AIR 1956 SC 213: Rajahmundry Electric Supply Corpn. Vs. Nageswara Rao. Besides, the law is thus stated in Halsbury’s Laws of England, 3<sup>rd</sup> Edition, Vol.6, p.534, para 1035: “<u>The words ‘just and equitable’ in the enactment specifying the grounds for winding-up by the court are not to be read as being ejusdem generis” with the preceding words of the enactment</u>. This law has been cited to and relied upon in AIR 1956 S.C. 213: Rajahmundry Electric Supply Corporation Ltd vs. A. Nageshwara Rao. In our jurisdiction, in the case reported in 34 DLR (AD) 47, at paragraph No.32, the apex court has held that, “there cannot be any precise definition or inflexible formula of the principle just and equitable clause. Whether or not there are equitable consideration for the application of the principle, must necessarily depend upon the facts and circumstances of the case and the judicial discretion of the court.” As such, having considered the authorities cited I hold that clause (vi) of section 241 of the Act is not to be considered with the reasons given in preceding clauses (i) to (v), in passing an order of winding up on the ground ‘just and equitable’.<br/> <br/>Then adverting my attention to another contention as to whether clause (ii) of section 241 of the Act is applicable in this particular case. I have considered the provisions of section 83 of the Act and I find that the provisions of section 83, requiring a company limited by shares or having a share capital, to hold the ‘the statutory meeting’ and to prepare “statutory report” is not applicable to a private company, as has been rightly submitted by the learned Advocate for the respondents.<br/> <br/>Next, considering that the Articles of Association of the company, vide Articles 39, 48 and 49, quoted in paragraph No.4 of the petition (and as recorded herein above) as well as contained in Annexure-A to the petition (Memorandum &amp; Articles of Association), I find that both groups of share holders, namely petitioners NO.1-5 forming group-B and the respondent Nos.3-7 forming group-A share holders, are holding shares in equal proportion, i.e. 5(five) share holders forming Group-A are totally holding 50,000 shares, each holding 1,000 shares, and 5 (five) shares holders forming Group-B are holding 50,000 shares in total, each holding 1,000 shares, out of 1,00,000 (One Lac) shares, as has been shown against the names of the subscribers to the Memorandum &amp; Articles of Association. In this back ground, I have looked into the provisions of Articles 39, 49. These 3(three) Articles read as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“39. The member of Directors of the company shall be ten. Each group shall represent five directors.<br/>48. <u>No business shall be transacted at any meeting of the Board unless a quorum is present when the meeting proceeds to business</u>.<br/>49. <u>4(four) directors at least two from each group present personally will form the quorum for transaction of business at a meeting of the Board of Directors. All questions arising at any meeting of Directors shall be decided by majority of votes</u>.” (underlining is mine).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Now, apparently group-B share holders, holding 50% shares in the company, has filed this petition for winding up alleging that non-cooperation of group-A share holders, holding the rest 50% of share. Therefore, in this situation, according to the submission made on behalf of the petitioner, no quorum could be formed, no decision could be arrived at or adopted on majority basis, hence no business could be done and that there no possibility to implemt the objects for which the company has been formed and that even no board meeting or AGM can be called or held on behalf of the company. I find substance in the submission, advanced on behalf of the petitioner, that Group-A share holders, holding 50% shares, cannot be compelled by the other group  of the share holders (i.e. Group-B) to consent to or to pass an agenda which one group considered material or important to achieve the object for which the company has been formed.<br/> <br/>Besides, Article 49 of the Articles of Association prescribed that at least two directors from each group of the directors shall remain personally present to form the quorum to transact any business and that, as per Article 49, the decision in any meeting of the board of directors shall be decided by majority of the votes, whereas there is no provisions for any casting vote, in the Articles of the Association. As such no meetings of the board of directors or any general meetings, for want of quorum, can be held or called for non co-operation of other group of directors, namely respondent Nos.3-7, as alleged, and that there is no certainty that quorum will be present or that any decision can be carried out by the majority of the votes as per Articles 48 and 49. Indeed, I find no material on record to think or presume otherwise. This contention of the learned advocate of the petitioner gets support from the statements made in at clause-(e) of paragraph No.10 of the affidavit in opposition, wherein allegations has been made that “<u>the petitioner No. 1 is not providing necessary informations or documents to the contenting respondent with bad intention to create misunderstanding between the two groups of Directors and as such contesting respondents have decided to buy off the shares of the petitioners to run the company in accordance with law and the respondent No.3 is ready to take over the charge of the Managing Director of the company in view of the Article 61 of the Articles of Associations”</u>.<br/> <br/>As such, I find that the admitted position is that the parties are not willing to continue or to do business together and that the provisions have been made in Article 48 and 49 in a way, by omitting the provision for casting vote, that there is no way out of the dead lock created, as has been alleged in this case, in the process of taking any decision upon forming quorum in the manner provided for under Article 48 and 49. Hence, I am of the considered opinion that the company can not exist or run or be managed as a going concern by the existing board of directors, clearly divided into two groups, namely Group-A and Group-B and each group holding equal number of shares.<br/> <br/>Moreover, the fact of keeping no provision for casting vote, in my view, is a glaring instance of distrust between the two groups and is responsible for creating a total dead-lock situation in running and managing the affairs of the company as a commercial concern. As such, from absence of the materials on record to draw any inference to the contrary, I find that a case of total dead lock in running and managing the affairs of the company as a commercial concern has been made out, in this case, on facts and from the circumstances revealed from the averments made by the parties as well as from the materials on record, and no device has been kept in these Articles to over come such dead lock either by forming quorum or by using casting vote, while the intention for separation in both groups is obvious from the fact of filing this petition by Group-B and from the allegations made in clause (e) of paragraph No. 10 of the affidavit in opposition by Group-A shareholders.<br/> <br/>In this respect I should refer to the decision reported in Company Cases, Vol. 52 page-36: Virendra Sing Bhandari V. Nandalal Bhandari &amp; Sons Ltd., wherein it has been held that, “principle of dissolution of partnerships can be applied to dead lock among members of the private company and that in such situation the company should be wound up”. Besides in our jurisdiction, in the case reported of the 34 DLR(AD) 47: Bengal Water Ways Ltd. V. Rahimuddin Ahmed &amp; ors, at paragraph No.24, it has been held that “No doubt deadlock in the affairs of the company by itself, has not been made a ground under section 162 of the Companies Act, for winding up a company, but clause (vi) provides that if the court is of opinion that it is just and equitable that the company should be wound up, the court may wind up a company”. Then, at paragraph No. 32 of the same judgment, it has been held that, “there cannot be any precise definition or inflexible formula of the principle of ‘just and equitable’ clause. Whether or not there are equitable considerations for the application of the principle, must necessarily depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case and the judicial discretion of the Court. …………… <strong>.</strong> <u>Where there is lack of confidence in each other, the partnership cannot simply work and in that case it is desirable and expedient that the relationship should be ended</u>.” The apex court then, at paragraph No. 23 of said case has held that “<u>the long line of decisions from the courts down to the Supreme Courts of the sub-continent tend to show that the principles applicable in the case of dissolution of partnership equally applied in the case of winding up of a private limited company and to treat the case of a private limited company more or less as a partnership</u>”. It is to be noted here that clause (VI) of section 162 of the Companies Act, 1913 is now clause (VI) of section 241 of the Companies Act, 1994. (underlining is mine).<br/> <br/>Again, in the case reported in AIR 1976 (SC) 565: Hind Overseas Private Ltd Vs. Raghunath Prashad Jhunjhunwalla, (at paragraph No. 32) it has been held that “<u>Besides, it is only when share holding is more or less equal and there is a complete case of dead lock in the company on account of lack of probity in management of the company and there is no hope or possibility of smooth and efficient continue of the company as commercial concern there may arrived a case of winding up on just and equitable ground</u>”. (underlining is mine).<br/> <br/>I respectfully agree with these views cited above and find these views applicable in the facts and circumstances of this case.<br/> <br/>Considering the facts that admittedly both groups of share holders have withdrawn an amount of Tk.62 crore, each group Tk. 31 crore, from the fund of the company (which forms the part of asset of the company), when there was no board meeting recommending any dividend to be distributed amongst the share holders and there was no AGM approving distribution of any dividend, this ground alone is sufficient to invoke application of clause-(VI) of section 241 of the Act on the ground of mismanagement of the affairs of the company by the directors. In the case reported in AIR 1956 (SC) 213: RES Corpn Ltd. v. Nageshwara Rao, it has been held at paragraph No. 8 that, “The words “just and equitable” in S. 162 (vi) are not to be construed ‘ejusdem generis’ with the matters mentioned in cls. (i) to (v) and, therefore, whether mismanagement of the directors is a ground for a winding up order under S. 162(vi) becomes a question to be decided on the facts of each case. Where nothing more is established then that the directors have misappropriated the funds of the company, an order for winding up would not be just or equitable, because if it is a sound concern such an order must operate harshly on the rights of the shareholders. But if, in addition to such misconduct, circumstances exist which render it desirable in the interests of the share-holders that the company should be wound up, there is nothing in S. 162(vi) which bars the jurisdiction of the court to make such an order”. I also find the view expressed in AIR 1956 (SC) 213 applicable in the facts and circumstances of this case as I have found and recorded the circumstances of total dead lock created in this case, in addition to mismanagement or misconduct of both group of directors in withdrawing Tk. 62 crores, each group admittedly taking Tk. 31 crore from the account of the company. Moreso, Group-B share holders have expressed their intention to refund the money to the account of the company, vide paragraph No. 7 of the petition, while Group-A has made no such commitment, though they also admitted to have received the equivalent amount.<br/> <br/>Besides, I have considered alongside the applications for addition of parties. I find that there specific assertion of making payment of several instruments since 2010, against several plots, raising the figure above croes of taka, but no allotment of any plot could have been made to this applicants, as yet, and out of their anxiety they have submitted these 4 sets of application to add them as parties to this proceeding, so that, as claimants, they can get back their money invested in the company with the hope of getting allotment of the plots allotted to them, since they see no prospect of allotment of any plot.<br/> <br/>Then referring to Annexure-D series, annexed to the petitions, I am not inclined to consider the grounds taken in these applications in deciding the merit of this application with reference to clause (vi) of section 241 of the Act, in as much as this is not an application filed by the creditors for voluntarily winding up of the company. But, significance of these 4 sets of applications lie in taking into consideration the interest and intention of the creditors (they are creditors of the company since no plot has yet been transferred to or registered in their name). However, I am of the view that because of supervening impossibility resulted from and due to the total dead lock in managing the affairs of the company and owing to mis-management and withdrawal of money from the accounts of the company as recorded above, the allottees are not bound to further perform their obligations, in this particular case, with reference to the terms and conditions of the allotment letters issued in their favour and they are entitle to receive their entire money back.<br/> <br/>Before parting of, I should record that no doubt a petition filed with malafide intention or in a case where petitioner has not come before this court in clean hands, the petition should not be allowed. But in view of the facts and circumstances of this case, recorded herein above, I consider this ground as not tenable and not attracted in this case.<br/>Hence, in the facts and circumstances of this case and the decisions quoted and consulted herein above, I am of the considered view that it will be just and equitable to pass an order of winding up of the respondent No. 2 (company). I find merit in this application.<br/> <br/>In the result this petition is allowed and the company is hereby wound up as per provisions of clause (vi) of section 241 of the Act.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>(A)   Accordingly it is ordered-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">(1) that the petitioner or his advocate shall send to the Registrar of Companies a notice of this order, in Form No. 18, to enable him to notify the Official Receiver about this judgment and order, as required by Rule 75 of the Companies Rules, 2009.<br/>(2) that, in exercise of the power vested in that behalf and pursuant to the provisions of sections 251(2) and 255(3) of the Act, read with Rule 76 of the Companies Rules, 2009, the Official Receiver and learned advocate Mr. Akheruzzaman, a member of the Supreme Court Bar, having his law chamber named THE LAW FOCUS, Aptt.

Shamsul Huq, Advocate, instructed by Mr. Md. Abu Siddique, Advocate-on-Record.<br/><strong>For the Respondents: </strong>None Represented<br/><br/><strong><u>Criminal petition for leave to appeal No. 389 of  2010</u></strong><br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></span><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Syed Mahmud Hossain, J:</u></strong> This criminal petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 14.02.2010 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Criminal Appeal No. 1691 of 2001 challenging the judgment and order dated 24.04.2001 passed by the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Daman) Bishesh Adalot No.3, Tangail in Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Case No.150 of 1999 convicting the accused-appellants under section 8(1) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishesh Didhan) Ain, 1995 and sentencing each of them to suffer imprisonment for life and also to pay a fine of Tk. 5,000/- each, in default, to suffer imprisonment for 1 (one) year more.<br/><br/>The facts, leading to the filing of this criminal petition for leave to appeal, in a nutshell, are:<br/><br/>     The prosecution case is that on 01.12.1998, Md. Moslemuddin lodged a First Information Report with Shakhipur Police Station against the appellant-petitioner. The informant is a poor man and he has been earning his livelihood as a day labourer. About five months back, the accused-petitioners took his minor daughter, Nazma Khatun, to Tangail to provide her with a job at a monthly salary of Tk.300/- on the assurance that his daughter would be happy in Tangail in the house of their relatives and she would be given in marriage to a good boy. Believing in the assurance of the accused-petitioners, the informant allowed his daughter to go with them. The assurance was also given that within 10/15 days, she would come back. Accordingly, the informant was eagerly waiting but meanwhile ¾ months elapsed. Then the informant exerted pressure upon the accused-petitioners through village ‘elites’ but at that time they denied taking his daughter. The informant then tried to trace out his daughter in different places. After that, he came to know that the accused-petitioners very tactfully sold his daughter in the brothel and her name was changed to Dilara who kept in the room of ‘Jharna’, the leader of the brothel. She was compelled to lead her life as a prostitute. On getting such news, the informant along with Md. Fayez Uddin Sentu, Shah Alam went to the Police Station and with the help of the police force recovered his daughter on 29.11.1998 at 7 o’clock from the brothel and she was taken in his custody. Hence Shakhipur Police Station Case No.1/106 dated 01.12.1998 was started against the accused-petitioners.      </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Police took up investigation of the case and on conclusion thereof, submitted charge-sheet against accused petitioners under section 8(1) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain, 1995.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The case record was transmitted to the Court of the learned Judge, Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Bishesh Adalat No.3, Tangail for trial where it was registered as Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Case No.150 of 1999.<br/><br/>The prosecution examined thirteen witnesses in support of its case while defence examined none.<br/><br/>The defence case as could be gathered from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses is of total denial contending, inter-alia, that the accused were falsely implicated in this case out of enmity inasmuch as they were not responsible for/connected with the occurrence. The alleged confessional statement is not true and voluntary and the same is the product of physical/mental torture.<br/><br/>After close of the prosecution case, the accused-petitioners in the dock were examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to which, they pleaded not guilty and repeated their innocence. The defence, did not, however, examine any witness.<br/><br/>The learned Judge of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Bishesh Adalat No.3, Tangail, found the accused-petitioners guilty of the offence charged and by his judgment and order dated 24.04.2001 convicted the accused-petitioners under section 8(1) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain, 1995 and sentenced each of them to suffer imprisonment for life and also to pay a fine of Tk.5,000/- each, in default, to suffer imprisonment for 1 (one) year more.  <br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and order of the trial Court, the convict-petitioners moved the High Court Division by filing Criminal Appeal No.1691 2001. The learned Judges of the High Court Division upon hearing both the sides by their  judgment and order dated 14.02.2010 dismissed the appeal affirming the judgment and order passed by the learned Judge of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Daman) Bishesh Adalat N.3, Tangail.<br/><br/>Feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division, the leave petitioners preferred this criminal petition for leave to appeal before this Division.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Shamsul Huq, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the leave petitioners, submits that the High Court Division has failed to consider that the trial Court fell into serious error in law in not considering the inherent defect of the prosecution case in that there was a G.D. Entry being No.1347 dated 29.11.1998 which did not tally with the facts set forth in the FIR filed by the informant and in that view of the matter, the petitioners should have been acquitted by giving benefit of doubt and as such, the impugned judgment should be set aside. He further submits that P.W.6, Abdul Baset and P.W.9, Asia Begum, the brother and the mother respectively of the victim did not support the prosecution case and that without considering their evidence, the High Court Division maintained the conviction and sentence of the accused-petitioners and as such, the impugned judgment should be set aside. <br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocate, perused the impugned judgment and the materials on record.<br/><br/>The High Court Division came to a finding that the petition of complaint was lodged on 30.11.1998 and that the FIR was lodged on 01.12.1998 and that while she was recovered from the brothel on 30.11.1998, police went to the brothel on 29.11.1998 on the basis of G. D. No.1398 dated 30.11.1998 which was made for the security of the victim and that after recovery of the victim, the FIR was lodged. The High Court Division further found that P.W.1, the informant and P.W.2, the victim and P.Ws.4 and 5 deposed that the accused took the victim with a promise to give her job  and without doing so they sold her to a brothel and that there was no contradiction in the evidence of the victim and that of her father, P.W.1.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The High Court Division noticed that P.W.6 Abdul Baset is not the full brother of P.W.2, Nazma and that P.W.7, Asia Begum is not the mother of the victim; rather P.W.7 is the step mother of the victim. With reference to the affidavit filed by the petitioners, the High Court Division found that the petitioners tried to impress upon that the victim of her own volition went to the brothel but that the said affidavit was neither properly exhibited nor was it filed in the trial Court and that the victim denied making any affidavit. The High Court Division having considered the evidence of doctor, P.W.9 and the medical report, exhibit-1 found that the age of the victim was about 17 years on the date of her examination and that the victim in her evidence claimed that she was about 13 or 14 years old.<br/><br/>The finding of the doctor as to age is belied by the fact that his report shows the taking place of menarche one year back. In context of development of girls in Bangladesh the age stated by the victim would be more commensurate with menarche having started one year previously.<br/><br/>The accused-petitioners having no morality could dare to sell the victim-P.W.2, Nazma to a brothel. They were convicted under section 8(1) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain, 1995 and sentenced them to suffer imprisonment for life. The order of conviction and sentence was rightly affirmed by the High Court Division.<br/><br/>The conviction and sentence will serve as a deterrent and reminds us of <strong>Dr. Martin Luther King JR</strong> who once stated as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Morality cannot be legislated, but behaviour can be regulated. Judicial decrees may not change the heart, but they can restrain the heartless.” </div><div style="text-align: justify;">        <br/>The findings of the High Court Division having been made on proper appreciation on evidence of P.Ws. and other documentary evidence do not call for interference. Accordingly, this criminal petition for leave to appeal is dismissed. <br/><br/><strong>Ed.<br/><br/>Reference: 4 LNJ AD (2015) 15.</strong></div></div></div>
