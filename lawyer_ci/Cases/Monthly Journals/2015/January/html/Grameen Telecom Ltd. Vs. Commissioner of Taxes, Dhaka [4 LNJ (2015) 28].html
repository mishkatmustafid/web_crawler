References were contested by the Income Tax department through the learned Deputy Attorney General Mr. Abdur Rahim Bhuiyan who submitted affidavit-in-oppositions in all these I.T. References in more or less in similar assertions wherein it has been asserted that the questions which have been raised by the Assessee-Applicant are absolutely factual and involves no point of law for which those deserve no consideration by this bench; the grounds as have been taken by the Assessee-applicant are defective, misleading and misconceived and not related to the finding of the lower appellate authority and therefore not tenable in the eye of law; the Assessee-applicant having raised irrelevant, untenable and unnecessary contentions, the application in all these references are liable to be rejected and no answer need to be given to the question raised or if given may be given in favour of the tax department.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali, appeared on behalf of the Assessee-applicant while the learned Deputy Attorney General Mr. Abdur Rahim Bhuiyan represented the income tax department at the time of hearing.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali, appearing on behalf of the Assessee-applicant while explained the back grounds of these references taken us through the original assessment orders and the impugned appellate judgments and strenuously argued that the concerned DCT while making the basic assessment violated the Provisions of Section 29(1)27 and 35(3) of the income tax ordinance 1984 in as much as the amount of expenses which has been disallowed by the DCT concerned are business expenditure and that the Assessee-applicant being a company filed with the return the audited accounts certified by the chartered Accounts, but the commissioner of Taxes(Appeal) as well as the Taxes Appellate Tribunal did not pay any heed to it and reduced the amount of disallowance mechanically without entering into the legality of such assessment and as such committed gross illegality in confirming/reducing the disallowances made by the DCT in the profit and loss account, instead of deleting the same in full, in as much as the business of the Assessee-applicant comes from the sale of Air time of mobile phone and also the hand set of mobile phones and accessories which are being imported under an agreement with the principal abroad ‘The Nokia’<br/> <br/>The leaned Advocate Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali further argued that the Assessee-applicant company having maintains regular books of accounts under the admitted mercantile system of accounting, the concerned DCT without pin pointing any defect in the method of accounting ignored the book version of the accounts which being violative of the Provisions of section 35(4) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, is required to be considered by this court in answering the question in negative as has been formulated by the Assessee-applicant and in favour of the Assessee-Applicant. The learned Advocate Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali contend that the method of accounting of the income of the Assessee-applicant  company, being audited by the statutory auditors and confirmed by the Board of Directors of the Assessee-applicant company, which conforms with the standard of accounting and accordingly the concerned DCT was bound to accept the same under the provision of section 35(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and if the DCT disputes any item of the accounts he should at the time of assessment must pin point the same and shall attempt to be satisfied by observing the provision of section 43(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and shall attempt to be satisfied by observing the provision of section 43(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance and cannot arbitrarily reject any of the item. But in the instant case the concerned DCT most illegally and arbitrarily rejected the books of accounts of the Assessee-Applicant in respect of the expenditure and the commissioner of Taxes (Appeal) though reduced some of the disallowances, but the Taxes Appellate Tribunal without rejecting the entire disallowances affirmed the decision of the Commissioner of Taxes (Appeal) and as such the same is required to be considered by this court and the question which has been formulated by the Assessee-applicant  in this respect is required to be answered in negative and in favour of the Assessee-applicant.<br/> <br/>In this respect the learned Advocate Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali relied upon the decision of the case of Titas Gas (T&amp;D) Company Limited-Vs-Commissioner of Taxes reported in 53 DLR 209 and also relied on the case of Eastern Hardware Store-Vs-Commissioner of Taxes reported in 54 DLR 125. He further relied on the case of Commissioner of Taxes-Vs-M/S. Ata Hossain Khan Limited reported in 29 DLR(AD) 141.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali further argued that the discretion which can be exercised by the DCT in respect of disallowances must be exercised within the frame work of the legal sanction and in the instant case the DCT most arbitrarily rejected the expenses and assessed the income of the Assessee-Applicant company in a manner which prejudiced the Assessee-Applicant  not only in the finalization of its account to be placed before its share holders, but also in respect of payment of income tax by the company as the amount in arbitrary assessment of income goes beyond the actual income of the company for a particular year. The learned Advocate Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali contended that the discretion of statutory authority, particularly in the taxation matter, is not a unlimited discretion but should be exercised within the periphery of the legal sanction. In this respect the learned Advocate Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali relied on the case of Mark Builder Limited-Vs-Commissioner of Taxes reported in 59 DLR 463.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali finally argued that the DCT concerned most arbitrarily rejected the claim of the Assessee-Applicant regarding the written off bad debt in the books of accounts, which violated the Provisions of Section 29(1)(XV) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and as such the question as has been formulated by the Assessee-Applicant in this respect is required to be answered in negative and in favour of the Assessee-applicant.<br/> <br/>On the other hand the learned Deputy Attorney General Mr. Abdur Rahim Bhuiyan, appearing on behalf of the Taxes Department argued that the Taxes Appellate Tribunal was legally justified in not accepting the books of accounts submitted by the Assessee-applicant company as the concerned DCT pointed out specific and material defects in the accounts submitted by the Assessee-applicant Company, upon examination of the books of accounts, bills, vouchers and other related papers and the documents which the concerned DCT found unverifiable and tainted with excessive claim with lack of details of the expenses claimed in the Profit &amp; loss Account, sales or receipt of trading expenses.<br/> <br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General argued that the gross profit disclosed in the account can be accepted only where books of accounts are found proper, regular and verifiable in accordance with the accounting principal as per Provisions of Section 35(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984. But if the true and correct picture of income profit and gains cannot be ascertained on the basis of the produced materials, it would be the duty of the concerned DCT to discard the accounting method wholly or in part and to adopt the method of his own as per provisions laid down in clause-C sub-Section 4 of the Section 35 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984.<br/> <br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General Mr. Abdur Rahim Bhuiyan finally argued that the Taxes Appellate Tribunal was legally justified in upholding the disallowance made by the concerned DCT under the head of written off bad debt, since the DCT after examination of the bad debt allowed partial amount which were found authentic and verifiable as against total bad and not receivable debts claimed by the Assessee-applicant and therefore the order passed by the tribunal is really in accordance with law.<br/> <br/>In support of his arguments the learned Deputy Attorney General referred the decisions reported in 58DLR 531, 34DLR(AD) 298 and submitted that those decision established the law as to the point raised in these Income Tax References.<br/> <br/>We have heard the learned Advocate, perused the materials on record and the impugned judgments.<br/> <br/>In all these I T Reference applications one most pertinent question has been raised as to the legality or to extent of latitude available to the DCT as to ignoring the book version of the accounts maintained by the Assessee-applicant when no dispute as to the method of accounts was raised by the assessing officer.<br/> <br/>The power of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes (DCT) to ignore the book of accounts of the Assessee-applicant comes from the provision of section 35(4) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, which runs as follows; <br/> </div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><strong>Income Tax Ordinance 1984</strong><br/><strong><em>Section 35: Method of accounting</em></strong><em>—</em></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>All income classifiable under the head “Income from business or profession” or “Income from other sources” shall be computed in accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed by the Assessee.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), the Board may, in the case of any business or profession, or class of business or profession, or any other source of income, or any class of persons, by a general or special order, direct that the accounts and other documents shall be maintained in such manner and form, and that payments of commercial transactions recorded in such manner, as may be prescribed or as may be specified in such direction; and thereupon the income of the Assessee shall computed on the basis of the accounts maintained, payments made and transactions recorded accordingly.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Without prejudice to the preceding sub-sections, every public or private company as defined in [the Companies Act, 1913 (VII of 1913) or </em><em>­L¡Çf¡e£ BCe, 1994 (1994 p­el 18 ew BCe)</em><em>] shall, with the return of income required to be filed under this Ordinance for any income year, furnish a copy of the trading account, profit and loss account and the balance sheet in respect of that income year certified by a chartered accountant.</em></li></ol><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><em>Where—  </em></div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><em> (a) no method of accounting has been regularly employed, or if the method employed is such that, in the opinion of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes, the income of the Assessee cannot be properly deduced therefrom; or </em><br/><em>(b) in any case to which sub-Section (2) applies, the Assessee fails to maintain accounts, make payments or record transactions in the manner directed under that sub-Section; or </em><br/><em>(c) a company has not complied with the requirements of sub-Section (3);</em><br/><em>the income of the Assessee shall be computed on such basis and in such manner as the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes may think fit.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Sub-section 3 or Section 35 in particular provides as follows;</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><em>“without prejudice to the preceding sub-Sections, every public or private company as defined in the Companies Act 1913 (VII of 1913) or </em><em>­L¡Çf¡e£ BCe, 1994 (1944 p¡­ml 18 ew BCe<strong>)</strong></em> <em>shall, with the return of income required to be filed under this Ordinance for any income year, furnish a copy of the trading account, profit and loss account and the balance sheet in respect of that income year certified by a chartered accountant.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It appears that several disput upon such power of the DCT, exercised erroneously, were raised before this court and the question as has been formulated in this I.T. References, has already been answered in many other previous cases by this Division and also by the apex court of the country one of which is the case of Titas Gas (T&amp;D) Company Limited-Vs-Commissioner of Taxes, decided by the High Court Division and reported in 53 DLR 209, wherein his lordship Mr. Justice Syed Amirul Islam, in a bunch I.T. References applications, decided the similar points where his lordship expressed that;</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><em>“The legal position is that in the computation of income profit and gains of a company, the DCT is entitled to reject the books of account if he is of the opinion that no method of accounting has been regularly employed by the assessee or if the method employed is such that the income of the assessee cannot be properly deduced there from or that a company has not complied with the requirement of sub-section (3) of Section 35 of the Ordinance.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Similarly in the case of Eastern Hardware Store-Vs-Commissioner of Taxes reported in 54 DLR 125 his lordship Mr. Justice Syed Amirul Islam again on a similar point in an I. T. reference application held as under;</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><em>“As the Appellate Additional Commissioner of Taxes did not find any defect either with the method of accounting or in the accounts, neither of them can resort to estimation under Section 35(4)(a) of the Ordinance (1984) and thereby both of them acted illegally and that illegal order has been mechanically affirmed by the Appellate Tribunal which cannot be sustained in law.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Further in the case of Mark Builders Limited-Vs-Commissioner of Taxes reported in 53 DLR 463, his lordship Mr. Justice Md. Abdur Rashid in a similar question upon the provision of section 35(4) of the Income Tax ordinance 1984 raised in I.T. Reference applications, very eloquently decided the point as to the discretion of the assessment officer in rejecting the book version of the accounts of an assessee and held as under;</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">“<em>Under sub-Section (4) of Section 35 of the Ordinance, the Deputy Commissioner of taxes has got power to compute the income on such basis and in such manner as he thinks fit only where (a) no method of accounting has been regularly employed by an assessee being a company or (b) if the method employed is such that in the opinion of Deputy commissioner of taxes the income of the assessee cannot be deduced or (c) a company has not complied with the requirements of sub-Section (3). So, in the absence of any of the above grounds the Deputy commissioner of taxes has got no power to compute the income on any basis or in any manner he thought best.   </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The aforesaid decision although have settled the point and we found no reason to disagree, yet for our self when we further examined the matter found that the  aforesaid provision of section 35(3) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 mentioned about the limited company’s account for which we examined the provision of accounts affair of a limited company as provided in companies Act 1994. In the instant case it has not been disputed that the Assessee-applicant has not filed its audited account regarding trading account, profit and loss account and the balance sheet before the concerned DCT which proves that Assessee-applicant maintaining it account in Mercantile system of accounts.

text-align: justify;"> </div><p style="text-align: justify;">All these provisions relating to accounts of a limited company have been made with a view to safe guarding the share holders of a limited company from being defrauded by the directors of the company where all these provisions were strictly absurd there the share holders of the limited companies are safe guarded from any such fraudance which practically mandates a company to make true and genuine account. In all these provisions of the companies Act 1994 is allowed to be ignored by the DCT on its latitude to exercise discretion available in section 35(4) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, then one set of provision of law will be frustrated which can not be the intention of the legislature which formulating the provision of subsection (4)c.<br/> <br/>Admittedly the Assessee-Applicant is a private limited company. It has submitted its audited accounts made by the charted accountant pursuant to the requirement of the companies Act 1994 on the basis of the books of account, profit and loss account, trading account and the balance sheet and all these documents were submitted before the concerned DCT. As to the acceptability of Book of account of a company, it has been mentioned by their lordship in the case of Mark Builders Limited-Vs-Commissioner of Taxes reported in 59 DLR 463, upon perusing the case of Appollo tyres Ltd. –vs- Commissioner of Income Tax reported in (2003) 255 ITR No. 273, that the Supreme Court of  India enunciated the principal regarding the acceptability of Books of accounts of a company under the provision of section 115 of the (Indian) Income Tax Act 1961, prevailing in India, in the following manner;</p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“While so looking into the accounts of the company, an Assessing officer under the Income Tax Act has to accept the authenticity of the accounts with reference to the provisions of the Companies Act which obligates the company to maintain its account in a manner provided by the Companies Act and the same to be scrutinized and certified by the statutory auditor and will have to be approved by the company in its general meeting and thereafter to be filed before the Registrar of company who has statutory obligation also to examine and satisfy that the accounts of the company are maintained in accordance with the requirement of Companies Act.”  </em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It has been further stated in the said judgment that under Section 115(j) (1) the (Indian) Income Tax Act 1961, the income tax official shall accept the book profit in the case of an assessee, being a company if such company (i) maintains the accounts in accordance with the Provisions of the Companies Act (ii) scrutinized and certified by statutory auditors and (iii) approved in the general meeting of the company and (iv) examined and certified by the Registrar of companies. It has been further stated;</p><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><em>“that under the Indian Law there cannot be two incomes, one for the purpose of the Companies Act and the other for the income tax since both are maintained under the same Act; the Assessee officer has only power to examine whether the books of accounts are certified by the statutory authority to have been properly maintained under the Companies Act then, the assessing officer has limited power to increase or decrease under the explanation supplied in this Section; In view of such statutory scrutiny, examination and approval of the income at different stages, the assessing officer there enjoys little or no discretion in the assessment of income of a company”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>His lordship Mr. Abdur Rashid in the aforesaid Mark Builders case although found that the such principal as stated by the Supreme Court of India regarding the acceptability of books of account, profit and loss account by the assessing officer cannot be applicable in our law of income tax for lack of aforesaid stated scrutiny, examination and approval, yet the procedure as has been laid down in Companies Act 1994 to follow as to the approval of company accounts is not a futile exercise. The account which has been approved by the Board of the company, as the legislator in the provision of section 35(3) of the Income Tax Ordinance made provisions  for submission of such audited account along with the Income Tax return, cannot be brushed aside and ignored altogether by the Income Tax Authority unless the DCT concerned leave no stone unturned to satisfy itself, specially after serving notice under the provision of section 43(2) of the income tax ordinance, as to the explanation of the account supported by proper document. This satisfaction at the DCT concerned must be made apparent on the assessment clearly and not by making vague statement that the account is not verifiable.  It has been said by his lordship, to which we do also concur, that the latitude available to the DCT under section 35 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 is no doubt very wide, but can not be thought to be without any restraint in the process of assessment of the total income of an assessee under section 83(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984. Discretion available to statutory authority under the statute allowing exercise of statutory power, particularly in the fiscal matter, if thought to be unlimited, then exercise of such discretion may result in arbitrariness and selectively. This discretion can only be applied if not only when the accounts itself is of such nature that the DCT is unable to deduce the actual income of the assessee, but also that the affairs surrounding the accounts of the company does not support the accounts as true as prepared by the company. Unless the DCT found any defect in the method of the accounting it can not discard the account on his own surmise and conjecture. The defect must be clearing described in particular term and not vague.<br/> <br/>In the instant I.T. References the concerned DCT discarded the book of account on the reasoning that the accounts of the company was not verifiable but did not dispute that the method of accounting was not correct. In the absence of such finding, the concerned DCT is not authorized to step into the estimation process. This court has found from the narration of the assessment that all relevant document were submitted before the concerned DCT through which the entire accounts of the assessee was verifiable by the documents as have been filed by the Assessee-applicant before the DCT and the DCT without resorting to those documents, which supported the total income and the GP of the company most arbitrarily assessed the income of the Assessee-applicant company along with the GP which is complete violation of the provisions of Section 35(4) of the Income tax ordinance 1984.<br/> <br/>We have found that the parameter of discretion to be exercised by the DCT has already been decided by the different decisions of this court and therefore the question as has been raised before this court in these references, excepting the I.T. Reference No. 417 of 2008, is required to be answered in negative and in favour of the Assessee-applicant.<br/> <br/>So far the question formulated in I.T. Reference No. 417 of 2008 it appears that the DCT has stated a reason for not allowing a part of the bad debt written off from the companies books of account as deduction in the following context:</div><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><em>“কোম্পানীর ক্ষমতাপ্রাপ্ত প্রতিনিধি জনাব জে, আর, চৌধুরী, এফ, সি, এ, হাজির হইয়া বিবেচ্য বর্ষে মন্দ ও কুঋণের সৃষ্ট সঞ্চিতি এবং মন্দ ও কুঋণ অবলোপনের সমর্থনে একটি বিবরনী এবং তৎসমর্থনে কিছু প্রমানাদী দাখিল করেন। দাখিলকৃত তথ্য/ প্রমানাদী পরীক্ষা দেখা যায় যে, এস, আর, কে, এন্টারপ্রাইজ কে =১,০৮,৭৪৫/- টাকার জন্য, বুশরা ইন্টারন্যাশনাল কে =২১,৫০০/- ঢ~াকার জন্য, ওয়ান স্টপ সপ কে =৮৪,৮৩৮/- ঢ~াকার জন্য এবং বি,আই,টি,এস,লিমিটেড কে =১,১৪,৭২৫/- টাকার জন্য লিগ্যাল নোটিশ প্রদান করা হইয়াছে। এছাড়া অন্যান্য দেনাদারদের বির্রদ্বে কোন আইনি পদক্ষেপ গ্রহনের প্রমান বিদ্যমান নাই। ফলে এস, আর, কে, এন্টারপ্রাইজ এর বিপরীতে অবলোপনকৃত =১,০৮,৭৪৫/- টাকা, বুশরা ইন্টারন্যাশনাল এর বিপরীতে অবলোপনকৃত =২১,৫০০/-, ওয়ান ষ্টপ সপ এর বিবরনীতে অবলোপনকৃত =৮৪,৮৩৮/- এবং বি,আই,টি,এস, এর বিপরীতে অবলোপনকৃত =১,১৪,৭২৫/- টাকা।মোট অবলোপনকৃত ৩,২৯,৮০৮ টাকা প্রকৃত খরচ হিসাবে অনুমোদন করা হইল”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>But in the same assessment the DCT ignored the other part of written off bad debt on the ground that since the Assessee-Applicant has not taken any legal step for realizing the debt from his principal Nokia, the same cannot be taken into consideration as a bad debt and accordingly the same has been added to the income of the Assessee-Applicant.<br/> <br/>But this court finds that the  reason for such non action against the principal of the Assessee-applicant appears to be cogent as the Assessee-Applicant was required to continue with the business with his Principal Nokia Limited and all the dispute regarding the debt with his principal has to be settled by private negotiation in order to keep the business relation running with the principal and that settlement being a mandatory exercise under the agreement dated 18<sup>th</sup> October, 2001, executed in between the Assessee-Applicant and the Nokia HK Limited, the same is required to be taken into consideration by the DCT who most arbitrarily ignored the supporting documents as have been filed in respect of bad debt and its non-realization. These being the reality in the business world, the DCT was bound to take the matter into consideration upon exercising his discretion available under the provision of section 35(4) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984.<br/> <br/>It appears that the two appellate authority did not resort to the provision of law, rather on mere mercy reduced disallowance as made by the DCT concerned as such this court finds that the judgment passed by the lower appellate authority can not be sustained.<br/> <br/>Upon the discussion and reasoning as above, this court finds merit in the I.T. References and the question as have been formulated in these references for answering in negative.<br/> <br/>Therefore, the questions as have been formulated in all these I.T. References are answered in negative and in favour of the Assessee-Applicant. The taxes appellate Tribunal shall take step in accordance with the provision of section 161(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and dispose of the impugned cases in the light of the instant judgment.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the References succeeds. However there shall be no order as to costs.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.<br/><br/>Reference: 4 LNJ (2015) 28</strong></div></div></div>
