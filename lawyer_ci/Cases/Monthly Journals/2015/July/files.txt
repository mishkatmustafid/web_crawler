Ashraful Kamal, J: </u></strong></span><br/><br/>This criminal appeal was registered at the instance of the convict-appellants Abdul Kader and Salimullah against the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 09.08.2001 passed by the Assistant Metropolitan Sessions Judge and Special Tribunal No.10, Chittagong in Special Tribunal Case No. 149 of 2000 convicting the appellants under section 19(A) of the Arms Act, 1878 and sentencing them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 15 (fifteen) years each.<br/><br/>Brief facts, necessary for the disposal of the appeal are as follows;<br/>On 06.11.1999 Md. Alamgir, Sub-Inspector of police lodged a First Information Report with the Doublemooring Police Station, stating, <em>inter alia</em> that he alongwith his force were returning from their duties, when they reached to the place of occurrence at about 2:30 p.m.  then they  saw 4/5  young people were standing over there i.e. at the southern part of the House No. E/33, tiger pass railway colony under Police station-Doublemooring. When they challenged them all were fled away except the present appellants. After searched, they found one country made pipe gun with one cartridge from the waist of the appellant A. Kader and one country made pipe gun with one cartridge from the waist of the appellant Salim Ullah. Then, they seized the said incriminating articles and prepared the seizure list infront of the witnesses.  Thereafter, they hand over the said two appellants with seized arms to the Doublemooring Police Station.<br/><br/>After recording of the First Information Report the charge of the investigation was entrusted to Mr. Arman Hossen Sub-Inspector of Doublemooring Police, who on getting the responsibility visited the place of occurrence, prepared the sketch map with index, seized the alamots, examined the witnesses under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. After concluding the investigation, the investigating officer having found prima facie case against the convict appellants submitted charge sheet under section 19 (A) of the Arms act 1878 on 13.04.2000.<br/><br/>Thereafter, the case record was transmitted to the Special Trubunal No. 10, Chittagong for trial. The Special Tribunal No-10 on 04.09.2000 framed charge under section 19A of the Arms Act 1878 against the convict appellants, which was duly read over to them and to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/><br/>In this case prosecution examined as many as 5 (five) witnesses and defence examined none. On closing of the evidence the convict appellants were examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure where they again pleaded innocence.<br/><br/>From the trend of the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses it appears that the defence case is of innocence and that no incriminating articles were recovered from their control and possession, but they have been falsely implicated in this case out of enmity and grudge. <br/><br/>Considering the evidence on record, adduced by the prosecution, the Assistant Metropolitan Sessions Judge and Special Tribunal No.10, Chittagong found the convict appellants guilty of the offence punishable under section 19(A) of the Arms Act, 1878 and sentencing them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 15 (fifteen) years.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the impugned judgment and order dated 9<sup>th</sup> August, 2001 passed by the Assistant Metropolitan Sessions Judge and Special Tribunal No.10, Chittagong, the appellants preferred the instant appeal before this court, which was admitted on 25.06.2002. <br/><br/>Mr. Farid Uddin Khan, the learned Advocate appearing for the appellants submits that, this is absolutely a case of no evidence against the convict appellants. Next, he submits that there is no corroborative evidence on records in respect of the recovery of the alleged arms and ammunution. Rather, they are contradicted to each other. He further submits that from the statement of the PW-5 it is evident that at the time of occurrence no public witnesses was present. Finally, he submits that seizure list witnesses did not support the proseuction case in respect of seizure of the incriminating articles from the possession of the convict appellants. On the basis of the above submission, Mr. Khan prays for acquital of the appellants. <br/><br/>Mr. Farhad Ahmed, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the respondent submits that, all the prosecution witnesses proved the prosecution case to the hilt and prays that the present appeal should be dismissed in all fairness.<br/><br/>Before entering into the merit of the appeals, let us now examine the prosecution witnesses one after another.<br/><br/>Sheikh Md.

Rather, they have stated that they were not present at the time of occurrence and the police took their signature forcefully in blank paper. Both of them were unable to identify the appellants in the dock.  Moreover, Arman Hossain (PW-5) investigation officer of this case in his cross examination supported the statement of said PW-2 and PW-3 and stated that “ঘটনার সময় রাত বিধায় ঘটনার সময় ঘটনাসÛলে কোন লোক ছিল নাz” So, the recovery of the alleged incriminating articles from the appellants is not at all been proved by the independent seizure list witnesses. <br/><br/>Apart from that the prosecution witnesses No. 1 and 4 who are the police personnel stated in their examination in chief that they arrested the appellants at about 2-30 AM, but the prosecution witnesses No. 2 and 3 (who are the public witnesses) in their examination in chief stated that police awoke them from their house at about 1.00 or 1.30 AM and took their signatures on the seizure list.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding, statement of the PW-1 and PW-4 are profoundly contradictory and suspicious. PW-1 in his examination in chief stated that “<em>Avwg m½xq GmAvB RvwKi †nv‡mb mv‡R©›U KvbyP›`ª wek¡vm mnKvix `v‡ivMv </em>গোলাম মস¹ফা হাঃ এবং গোলাম হোসেন আনছার পি,সি কামান্ডার প্রদীপ  বিশ্বাস ও সঙ্গীয় অন্যান্য কনেষ্টবল সহ আম বাগান টাইগার পাশ এলাকায় উক্ত মামলার আসামীদের ধৃত করার জন্য তল্লাসীতে গেলে”, but in his cross examination he stated that “আমার দলে অফিসার এবং ফোর্সসহ কয়জন লোক ছিল এই মুহূর্তে তাহা খেয়াল নাইz”<br/><br/>Moreover, PW-1 in his examination in chief stated that “মামলার আসামীদের ধৃত করার জন্য তল্লাশীতে গে,,ল রাত অনুমান ২-৩০ ঘটিকার সময় টাইগার পাস রেলওয়ে কলোনীর মধ্যে দিয়ে পায়ে হাটিয়া ফেরার পথে টাইগার পাস কলোনীর ই/৩৩ বি এর দক্ষিন পার্শে ৫/৬ জন যুবককে দেখিয়া পাইয়া চ্যালে<em>”</em>  করিলে তাহারা দৌড়াইয়া পালাবার চেষ্টা করেz, but in his cross examination he stated that আমরা সন্ধ্যার দিকে বাহির হইz এবং ৩/৪  ঘন্টা তল্লাশি চালাই (পরে বলে) রাত্র ২-৩০ টা পর্য¿¹ ছিলামz<em>” </em> which creates serious doubt in respect of the alleged time of occurrence.<br/><br/>Furthermore, PW-1 in his cross examination stated that <em>“</em>ই/৩৩ বি বাসায় লোকজনের মধ্যে একজন মহিলা ছিলz এই মহিলার কথা এজাহারে উল্লেখ করি নাইz” From this statement, it is cristal clear that PW-1 definitely went Flat No.E/33 B at the time of occurrence, but he did not mention the aforesaid fact in the FIR reason best known to him.<br/><br/>More interestingly, in his cross examination PW-1 stated that “ ঢাকা-চট্রগ্রাম রোডের গাড়ী সারারাত চলে কিনা আমি জানিনাz ঢাকা থেকে চট্রগ্রামের নাইট কোচ সারারাত চলে নাz” which is unbelievable. PW-1 as police officer must knew the aforesaid elementary information, but it appears that he intentionally did not acknowledge such true fact, therefore, his truthfullness became questionable.<br/><br/>It also appears from the FIR that one Md. Arman Hossen, Sub-Inspector Doublemooring Police Station, C.M.P. Chittagong registered the First Information Report of the present case upon receiving the written ejaher from the informant Sheikh Md. Alamgir, Sub-Inspector, Chittagong GRP Police Station, Chittagong. But the informant Sheikh Md. Alamgir as PW-1 in his cross examination stated that “ আমি জি আর পি থানায় হাজির হইয়া এজাহার লিখিয়া অস»সহ পুলিশ দ্বারা আসামী এবং অস»সহ সকালের দিকে ডবলমুরিং থানায় পাঠাইয়া দেই”.<br/><br/>In the ejaher infromant stated that “আসামী আঃ কাদের এর প্যান্টের কোমরে গুজানো অবসয় ১টি দেশীয় ~~তরি পাইপগান ও একটি কার্তুজভর্তি অবসÛায় এবং আসামী সেলিমউল্লার লুঙ্গি কোমরে প্যাচে মোড়ানো এক দেশীয় ~~তরি পাইপগান ও একটি কার্তুজভর্তি অবসয় আটক করিয়া সনীয় ডবলমুরিং থানায় সংবাদ দেইz ডবলমুরিং থানার ডেলটা- ৫ সহ দাঃ আঃ মজিদ ও তার সংগীয় ফোর্সসহ আসিয়া পৌছিলে ঘটনাসÛলের পাশে রেলওয়ে কোয়াটারে বসবাসরত সাক্ষী (১) মোশারফ হোসেন দফাদার (২) আমিনুল হক ও (৩) অজিত কুমার মল্লিক এর উপসিতিতে আসামীদ্বয়ের হেফাজতে থাকা পাইপগান ২টি জব্দ করিয়া হেফাজতে নেই z এবং চট্রগ্রাম জি,আর,পি, থানার সাধারন ডায়রী নং ২১২, তাং ৬-১১-৯৯ মূলে হাজির হইয়া জি,আর,পি, চট্রগ্রাম জেলার উর্দ্ধতন অফিসারদের সহিত আলোচনা করি<br/>অতএব, ঘটনাসÛলটি ডবলমুরিং থানার এলাকাধীন হওয়ায় আসামী আঃ কাদের ও আসামী সেলিম উল্লা দ্বয়ের বিরুদ্ধে অস» আইনের ১৯ (ক) ও (চ) ধারা মোতাবেক বিচারের প্রার্থনা করিয়া উদ্ধারকৃত ২টি পাইপগান ও ২টি কার্তুজ ও জব্দ তালিকাসহ নিয়মিত মামলা রুজু করার প্রার্থনা জানাইয়া অত্র এজাহার দায়ের করিলাম”<br/><br/>Section 60 of the Code of Criminal Procedure deals with person arrested to be taken before Magistrate or officer in charge of police station, which runs as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“A police - officer making an arrest without warrant shall, without unnecessary delay and subject to the provisions herein contained as to bail, take or send the person arrested before a Magistrate having jurisdiction in the case, or before the offficer in charge of a police station.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Section 60 seem to be designed to secure that person arrested without warrant by a police officer shall take or sent the person arrested before a Magistrate having jurisdiction in the case, or before the officer in charge of a  police station without unnecessary delay.<br/><br/>Therefore, assence of the section 60 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is that any person arrested without warrant by a police officer shall be sent either before Magistrate having jurisdiction in the case, or before the officer in charge of the police station as soon as posible, except the reasonable time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to a Magistrate having jurisdiction in the case or to the officer in charge of a police station.<br/><br/>In the present case, the distance between the place of arrest and Doublemooring Police Station is only ½ (half) kilometre, but the informant after arresting the appellants without warrant at about 2.30 am (06.11.1999) took them to the GRP police station instead of handed over them to A. Majid Sub-inspector of Doublemooring police station along with his forces present over there (according to FIR) or officer in charge Doublemooring police station. Rather, he detained the appllants in GRP police station untill handed over them to the Doublemooring Police station at about 12:45 pm, long after 10 hours from the time of arrest, without showing any single explanation. As police officer he is not justified in detaining a person for one single hour except some reasonable grounds. And such inordinate 10 hours delay is not acceptable and also violation of section 60 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/>Law does not require particular number of witnesses to prove a case and conviction may be well founded even on the testimony of solitary witness provided his integrity and trustworthiness is not shaken by any adverse circumstances appearing on the record against him and the court at the same time is convinced that his testimony has ring of truth. The well known maxim which is a Golden Rule that “evidence has to be weighed and not counted” has been given statutory endorsement in section 134 of The Evidence Act which provides that no particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof of any fact.<br/><br/>Though section 134 of the Evidence Act provides that no particular number of witnesses is required for the proof of any fact, but in order to convict an accused solely on the basis of solitary witnesses like the police officer or the person who made the search and seizure, the Judge must ensure that these witnesses are disinterested and the evidence is unimpeachable and unshaken and the other witnesses to the search who are alleged to have resiled from their previous stand, are unworthy of credit.<br/><br/>In the present case the evidences of the police witnesses, PW-1 and PW-4 are not unimpeachable character, rather it suffers from inherent weakness being partisan in spirit. The police witnesses have not also been able to state as to whether the arms and ammunition were recovered from the exclusive possession and control of the appellants. Rather, they are given so many self contradictory statements.  More particularly stated  that statement of  the PW-1 is not free from doubt. On the other hand PW-2 and PW-3 being independent witnesses and their evidence is quite natural and probable having remained unrebutted. Furthermore, the prosecution has failed to examine the ‘lady’ as mentioned by the PW-1 in his cross examination, who was present at the time of place of occurrence at Flat No. F/33 and or examine any witness of non-partisan character to bring home the charge against the appellants.<br/><br/>From the judgment of the trial Court also it appears to us that the order of conviction and sentence is based on the uncorroborated testimony of the police witness only without taking into consideration that the evidence of such partisan witnesses is not unimpeachable being not independent.<br/><br/>In the view of the above, we find that the assessment of evidence made by the trial Court is not at all satisfactory and that the guilt of the accused appellants have not been proved by reliable and satisfactory evidence and, therefore, we hold that the conclusion arrived at as to the guilt of the accused appellants by the learned trial Court is erroneous and hence cannot be sustained in law.<br/><br/>In the above facts and circumstances and considering the above mandatory provision of law and by taking all the evidences cumulatively it cannot be said that the guilt of the convict appellants have been proved beyond a shadow of doubt and accordingly, we are of the opinion that this appeal has substance and that the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.<br/><br/>From the conspectus of the observations made above the inevitable result that follows is that this appeal succeeds.<br/><br/>In the result, the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 09.08.2001 passed by the Assistant Metropolitan Sessions Judge and Special Tribunal No.10, Chittagong in Special Tribunal Case No. 149 of 2000 under section 19 (A) of the Arms Act is hereby set aside as against the convict appellants Nos. (1) Abdul Kader son of Md. Abdur Rab (2) Salimullah son of Bashir Ahmed as they are found not guilty of the charge brought against them and they are acquitted from the charge levelled against them.<br/><br/>The convict-appellants Abdul Kader and Salimullah shall be set at liberty forthwith if they are not wanted in connection any other case.<br/><br/>The appellant No.2 Salimullah is on bail and discharged from his bail bond. <br/><br/>Send down the lower Court’s records at once with a copy of the judgment for information and taking necessary action.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

(Pre-emption) Appeal No. 56 of 2010 allowing the appeal and setting-aside the judgment and order dated 24.02.2010 passed by the learned Senior Assistant Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Patiya, Chittagong in Pre-emption Misc. Case No.76 of 2005 disallowing the pre-emption should not be set aside.<br/><br/>The pre-emption case was filed on the averments that the pre-emptor is a co-sharer in the disputed holding by inheritance and as such he is entitled to pre-emption. The case was resisted by the pre-emptee petitioner on the ground that pre-emptee purchaser is not a stranger to the case jote inasmuch as he has many land surrounding the case land. It has been also contented that the pre-emptor-opposite party is not a co-sharer at all and as such the case is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>The pre-emptor-opposite party No.1, examined 3 witnesses including himself as P.W.1 and the pre-emptee petitioner examined 2 witnesses including herself as O.P.W.1 to prove their respective cases.<br/><br/>The Trial Court after closing of the evidence and hearing argument of the parties  by its  judgment and order dated 24.02.2010 disallowed the pre-emption on the ground that the pre-emptor could not prove that he is a co-sharer to the case jote.<br/><br/>The unsuccessful pre-emptor, thereupon, preferred Misc. Appeal No.56 of 2010 before the learned District Judge, Chittagong, which was eventually heard and disposed of by the Joint District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Chittagong, who by the impugned judgment and order dated 13.02.2013 allowed the appeal and set-aside the judgment  of the trial Court on the finding that in the facts and circumstance of the case the trial Court below committed wrong in holding that the pre-emptor is not a co-sharer to the case jote and the instant revision application is directed against that judgment  and order dated 13.02.2013.<br/><br/>Mr. Moudud Ahmed, the learned Advocate appearing for the pre-emptee-petitioner submits that the impugned judgment  and order is not at all a proper judgment of reversal inasmuch as the Court of appeal below without adverting the material findings of the trial Court below abruptly arrived at a finding that the trial Court below  committed illegality in holding that  the pre-emptor is not a co-sharer to the case jote.  He next submits that the appellate court below committed illegality in not holding that pre-emptor having lost his co-sharer ship  in the holding by separating his joma through mutation and cannot apply for pre-emption.<br/><br/>Finally, Mr. Mouded Ahmed submits that  in this case the pre-emptee purchaser himself was examined as OPW-1, who in his evidence categorically stated that the pre-emptor is not a co-sharer to the case land and the pre-emptee purchaser is a co-sharer to the case holding  inasmuch as he has more land surrounding the case land though the Court of appeal below as last Court of fact without considering the evidence of OPWs and without adverting the material findings of the trial Court below most illegally set-aside the judgment of the trial Court below which resulted in the failure of justice. Drawing support for his submissions, the learned Advocate referred to a decision reported in 55 DLR 214.<br/><br/>Mr. Syed Shahidur Rahman, the learned Advocate appearing for the pre-emptor-opposite party No.1, on the other hand, supports the impugned judgment and order and contends that the learned Joint District Judge was perfectly justified in setting aside the judgment of the trail court  on the clear finding that pre-emptor is a co-sharer to the case jote and he is entitled to preempt the case land.<br/><br/>Drawing my attention to the evidence of  PW-1, PW-2 and PW-3,  the learned Advocate submits all of them categorically stated in their respective testimony that the pre-emptee-purchaser is stranger to the case land and the pre-emptor-opposite party  is a co-sharer to the case jote by inheritance.  He further submits that the Court of appeal below  on the facts of the case and on consideration of the legal position rightly passed the impugned judgment and order and as such the same should not be disturbed. Mr. Syed Shahidur Rahman to strengthen his submission has  relied on the decisions reported in 35 DLR(AD) 54 and 34 DLR 180.<br/><br/>I have considered the submissions of the  learned Advocates for both the sides and perused the revision application, deposition of witnesses, judgments of two Courts below and other materials on record.   The main point for consideration is, as already noticed, whether the Court of appeal below was right  in holding that the trial Court below committed wrong in disallowing the pre-emption on the finding the pre-emptor could not prove that he is a co-sharer to the case jote.<br/><br/>It appears that in this case pre-emptor himself was examined as PW-1, who in his cross-examination stated that:- বি, এস, ২১৩৩ ও ২১৩৯ নং খতিয়ানে আমার নাম নাইz বি, এস, রেকর্ডীয় মুস¹াফিজুর রহমান মারা যায়z তাদের ওয়ারিশ কয়জন জানিনাz কাঞ্চন মিয়াকে পক্ষ করেছি বি, এস, রেকর্ডীয় মরিয়ম খাতুন কে চিনি নাz নালিশী ভূমি বি, এস, ২১৩৩ ও ২১৩৯ খতিয়ানের ভূমিz ১ নং প্রতিপক্ষের দাখিলীz জবাব পড়ি নাইz ১ নং প্রতিপক্ষের নামে নালিশী জমি সম্পর্কে বি, এস, ৬৪৫ নং নামজারী খতিয়ান হয়েছে কিনা জানিনা<br/><br/>Pre-emptee-purchaser himself was examined as OPW-1, who in his deposition stated that:- নালিশী ভূমির চর্তুদিকে আমার জমিz ঐ ভূমি ২৩/১১/২০০২ ইং তারিখের ৭০২২ নং কবলা মুলে খরিদ করিz This witness also stated that:- নামজারী খতিয়ান মুলে জমা ভাগ করেছি প্রার্থীক আমার হোল্ডিং এ শরীক নহে<br/><br/>OPW-2, Md.

It appears from the “Exhibit No.Kha” that the pre-emptee-purchaser after purchasing the case land mutated his name.<br/><br/>From the evidence of PWS and OPWS, it is apparent  that in this case both the parties are claiming that they are co-sharer to the case jote.<br/><br/>Now, to cut shot the matter it will be useful to quote hereunder a few lines  from the judgment of the trial Court, which reads as follows:<br/>“পর্যালোচনায় দেখা যায় প্রার্থীর অগ্রত্র্রয় আবেদনে তার পূর্ববর্তী মাওলানা হারুন ইসলামাবাদী আর, এস, রেকর্ডীয় স্বত্ববান ব্যক্তিগণ হতে না তাদের ওয়ারিশ হতে খরিদ পুর্বক স্বত্ববান ও দখলকার ছিলেন তা সুস্পষ্টভাবে উ~ল্লেখ করেননিz আর, এস, রেকর্ডীয় স্বত্ববান ব্যক্তিগণ কোনকোন ব্যক্তিকে স্বত্ববান ওয়ারিশ রেখে মৃত্যুবরণ করেনz উক্ত বিষয়েও সুস্পষ্ট বর্ণনা প্রার্থীর অগ্রত্র্রয় আবেদনে উল্লেখ নাইz নালিশী আশিয়া মৌজাসহ অত্র এলাকায় হাল বি,এস, জরীপে বি, এস, খতিয়ান চুড়া¿¹ ভাবে প্রচারিত হয়ে পৃথক জোত জমার সৃষ্টি হয়েছেz আইনের বিধান মতে অগ্রত্র্রয় আবেদন হাল জোত  জমার উপর নির্ভরশীল z নালিশী মোজায় নালিশী আর, এস, ১৪৪৩, আর এস ১৪২০ এবং আর, এস, ১৪৯০ নং খতিয়ানের ভুমি বাবদ কত নম্বর হাল বি, এস, খতিয়ান চুড়া¿¹ ভাবে প্রসºত ও প্রচারিত হয়েছে তা প্রার্থীর আবেদনে উল্লেখ করা হয়নিz হাল বি, এস, জরীপে কোন কোন ব্যক্তি শরীক প্রজা এবং প্রার্থী হাল বি, এস, খতিয়ানের ভ¤ুমতে শরীক প্রজা কিনা ইত্যাদি বক্তব্য প্রার্থীর অগ্রত্র্রয় আবেদনে সুস্পষ্ট ভাবে উল্লেখ নাইz প্রার্থী কতিপয় দলিল দাখিল করে নালিশী জোতের ভুমিতে শরীক প্রজা দাবী করলেও তার অগ্রত্র্রয় আবেদন হাল জোত জমা এবং উক্তজোত জমার শরীকান সম্পর্কে উপযুক্ত বর্ণনা সংযোজন  না করায় প্রার্থী নালিশী কবলার ভুমিতে শরীক প্রজা দাতার বিষয়ে সুম্পষ্ট ও খরচ ধারনা পাওয়া গেল নাz প্রার্থীর অগ্রত্র্রয় আবেদনের বক্তব্য অস্পষ্ট এবং দ্বার্থক মর্মে সাব্যস¹ হল” and, on this finding the Assistant Judge dismisses the pre-emption case.<br/><br/>This being the finding of fact based on assessment of the evidence on record. The  appellate court below in its turn without adverting this  material  findings of the trial Court  came to  a finding that: “বিজ্ঞ নিম্ন আদালতে প্রার্থীর শরিকদার না হওয়া সম্পর্কে যে সমস¹ বিষয়ে বিজ্ঞ নিম্ন আদালত এ্রটি বিচ্যুতির তথ্য উল্লেখ করিয়াছেন তাহা গ্রহনযোগ্য নহেz নিম্ন আদালতে দায়েরকৃত আরজী জবাবের এই সমস¹ ভুল এ্রটি মামলার গভীরে প্রবেশ করিলে উপেক্ষিত হইতে পারে” and, on this finding the learned Joint District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Chittagong set-aside the judgment of the trial Court.<br/><br/>On consideration of the matter, I find no difficulty whatever in holding that   the trial Court had considered the material evidence in detail in coming to its finding on the point of co-sharership of the pre-emptor in the case holding, but the appellate court, without discussing the evidence had abruptly reversed the finding of fact arrived at by the trial court which is not a proper judgment of reversal.<br/><br/>It is the requirement of law that the pre-emptor must be proved that he is a co- sharer to the case jote and his  co-sharer ship in the disputed holding has not been ceased by adducing sufficient convincing  evidence  in order to preempt case land but in this case on going through the evidence both oral and documentary, I do not find any reason to hold that    the pre-emptor has been succeeded to make out a clean case that  he is a co- sharer to the case jote and his  co-sharer ship in the disputed holding  has not been ceased. My view is, therefore, that  the learned Joint District Judge seriously erred in law in passing the impugned judgment without properly applying his judicial mind into the facts and circumstances of the case and law bearing on the subject and the same has resulted in an error in the impugned decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/><br/>In the result, the Rule is made absolute. The impugned judgment and order dated 13.02.2013 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Chittagong in Misc. (Pre-emption) Appeal No. 56 of 2010 is set-aside. The order of stay granted earlier by this Court stands vacated.<br/><br/>In the result, the Rule is made absolute. The impugned judgment and order dated 13.02.2013 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Chittagong in Misc. (Pre-emption) Appeal No. 56 of 2010 is set-aside. The order of stay granted earlier by this Court stands vacated.<br/><br/>Let a copy of this judgment along with the lower Court’s record be sent down at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Invoking Article 104 of the Constitution, we are of the view that the sentence should be altered to impriso-nment for life under Section 302 of the Penal Code instead of death under Section 11(ka) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000. . . .(11)</strong><br/> <br/><strong><u>Criminal Appeal No. 04 of 2014 with Jail Petition No. 10 of 2004</u></strong><br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Md. Muzammel Hossain, CJ:</strong><br/><br/>This criminal appeal at the instance of the appellant by leave is directed against the judgment and order dated 24.03.2004 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Death Reference No.08 of 2002 along with Criminal Appeal No.603 of 2002 and Jail Appeal No.141 of 2002 accepting the Death Reference-in-part confirming the death sentence of the condemned prisoner-appellant-Anarul @ Anarul Hoq and rejecting the same in respect of two other condemned prisoners finding them not guilty and acquitting them and thus allowing the criminal appeal and the Jail Appeal-in-part.<br/><br/>The prosecution case, in brief, is that the informant Md. Rahimuddin, father of the victim-Ranjina Begum lodged an ejahar stating, interalia, that Ranjina Begum was given in marriage to the appellant on 12.11.1999; that the house of the appellant is about 5/7 miles away from the house of the informant; that the appellant demanded dowry from the wife of Ranjina, which she could not meet and as a result she was driven out from the house of the appellant, by the appellant and his brothers and mother; thereafter there was a salish over the matter in presence of the local Union Parishad Chairman and according to the advice of the Chairman, the victim Ranjila was sent back to the house of the appellant; that on 26.02.2002 the informant, father of the victim heard from the local people that a dead body of woman was lying by the Railway Lines and after hearing the same the informant and his relatives went there and saw the dead body of the victim Ranjina with injuries on her person. He came to learn that the accused Anarul with the help of other accused persons killed his daughter for dowry and left the dead body by the side of the railway track and ultimately over the said occurrence the informant made a written complaint to the Magistrate on 05.03.2000 on the allegation that he tried to lodge an FIR with the G.R.P. Police but they being influenced by the accused persons did not record the same, for which, he was compelled to make the complaint.<br/><br/>The defence case as revealed from the trend of cross-examination is that after marriage the victim could not adjust with her husband, the appellant; that as she did not like him, she came back to her father's house and then she was compelled to go back to her husband's house again on the mediation of the local Chairman, but still she could not adjust with her husband that means she did not like him and she committed suicide and the appellant and others have been implicated falsely on the allegation of murder of the victim, for dowry by assault.<br/><br/>In this case eight P.Ws. were examined on behalf of the prosecution but none was examined on behalf of the defence. The appellant pleaded not guilty at the time of his examination under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is stated that the alleged occurrence took place on 26.02.2002 on the night following and the FIR was lodged on 28.02.2002, so there is chance of embellishment of the prosecution case and moreover there is no specific date of demand of dowry by the appellant and there is no mention of any witness in the FIR as to seeing and knowing about the occurrence or demand of dowry.<br/><br/>The Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Nilphamari (wrongly written as Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Bishesh Adalat, Nilphamari) by the judgment and order dated 16.03.2002 convicted the accused-appellant Anarul @ Anarul Hoq under Section 11(ka) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain,2000 and sentenced him to death and that death would be executed by hanging by the neck till the death subject to the confirmation of death by the High Court Division and also to pay a fine of Tk.10,000/- in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for six months more.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and order dated 16.03.2002 passed by the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Nilphamari the appellant along with two other accused preferred appeal being Criminal Appeal Nos.603 of 2002 before the High Court Division. This criminal appeal was heard along with Death Reference No.08 of 2002 and Jail Appeal No.141 of 2002. A Division Bench of the High Court Division by the impugned judgment and order dated 02.05.2004 accepted the Death Reference-in-part confirming the sentence of death in respect of the present appellant.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the impugned judgment and order dated 02.05.2004 passed by the High Court Division, the present appellant preferred Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No.164 of 2004 before this Court.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/>Leave was granted to consider the following grounds:<br/>"1.        Because that the High Court Division misconstrued the provision of Section 11(ka) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain,2000 and illegally applied the same in awarding death sentence to the petitioner-appellant, although it has not been proved at all that the alleged killing took place for Jautuk (dowry) and even demand of the same has not been proved.<br/>2.  Because there is no evidence warranting sentence of death to the petitioner-appellant in view of the evidence of the  doctor P.W.7, Farhad Alam who clearly deposed that the  Medical Board holding post mortem of the victim's dead  body. Could not come to a definite opinion as to whether the death was suicidal or homicidal in nature and the High Court Division misconstrued and misinter-preted the most vital and only evidence in this case namely, result and opinion of the post mortem examination.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Mr. Muhammad Nazrul Islam, the learned Advocate has appeared on behalf of the accused-appellant submits that the High Court Division misconstrued the provisions of Section 11(ka) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 and illegally applied the same in affirming the death sentence to the appellant and dismissing the appeal although it has not been proved at all that the alleged killing took place for jautuk (dowry) and demanding for joutuk has not been proved. He then submits that there is no evidence warranting sentence of death to the appellant in view of the evidence of the doctor P.W.7-Farhad Alam who clearly deposed that the Medical Board holding post mortem of the victim's dead body could not come to a definite opinion as to whether the death was suicidal, accidental or homicidal in nature and the High Court Division misconstrued and misinter-preted the most vital and only evidence in this case, namely, "result and opinion of the post mortem examination" and as such the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division is liable to be set aside. Alternatively without any prejudice to his earlier submission the learned Advocate further submits that since the prosecution failed to prove the demand of dowry, no case under Section 11(ka) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain,2000 was proved beyond reasonable doubt and the sentence of death penalty be commuted to life imprisonment or to imprisonment for lesser term.<br/><br/>Mr. Karunamoy Chakma, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing on behalf of the State submits that there is no illegality in the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division in affirming the death reference and dismissing the criminal appeal and the jail appeal which were heard and disposed of analogously.<br/><br/>We have heard the learned Advocates appearing on behalf of both the parties, perused the judgment and order passed by the Tribunal, the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division and also other materials available on record. On perusal of the records it appears the informant Rahim Uddin as P.W.1, father of the victim who stated in his examination-in-chief that his daughter was sent back to his house after assaulting her on demand of dowry and after settlement the matter by the local chairman he sent his daughter to the house of the accuseds and after a few days on the date of occurrence he found his daughter died following severe torture and his evidence was corroborated by other witnesses. P.W.1 was corroborated by P.Ws.2, 3, 4 and 6 in material particulars. The High Court Division having considered the material evidence of witnesses and the post-mortem report found that in the post-mortem report, the medical board found 12 injuries on the person of the victim. P.W.7-Dr. Farhad Alam proved the post-mortem report of 12 injuries, 8 haematomas are found on the head and legs. The medical board opined that all those injuries were caused by blunt weapons and the board also opined that death was due to haemerrhage and shock as a result of above mentioned injuries which were ante-mortem in nature. Admittedly, there is no eye witness of the occurrence. The case entirely rests upon circumstantial evidence. It was proved by the prosecution beyond doubt that Ranjina was living with her husband just before her death. According to the prosecution the victim was killed by her husband and other relatives at their house and then her dead body was kept by the side of the railway track. The postmortem report supported the prosecution version that Ranjina was beaten to death with blunt weapons rather the accuseds taken a false plea that the victim died of sudden pain in chest. In the absence of any explanation coming from the husband side it was none other than the husband is responsible for death of his wife. But it appears that all of the prosecution witnesses failed to prove that the convict-appellant demanded dowry at the time of causing death of the victim Ranjina. It also appears that the dead body of the victim was found by the side of the railway track not in the house of the appellant. Since it is wife killing case the onus is upon the appellant to disprove that the victim was not killed by him.<br/><br/>From the aforesaid discussions and findings, we are of the view that the judgment and order of the High Court Division having been passed on proper assessment and consid-eration of material evidence on record, there is no illegality or infirmity in the impugned judgment and order dated 12.06.2008 so far as it relates to the murder of the victim Ranijina, calling for any interference by this Court. But we are of the view that the prosecution miserably failed to prove the case of dowry. So no case was proved under Section 11(ka) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 rather it has proved the case of murder under Section 302 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. As such we are of the view that the sentence should be altered to imprisonment for life under Section 302 of the Code of Criminal Procedure instead of death under Section 11(ka) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000.<br/><br/>In the premises, Criminal Appeal No.04 of 2005 with Jail Petition No.10 of 2004 are hereby dismissed with modification of sentence. The accused-appellant Anarul @ Anarul Hoq is convicted under Section 302 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and sentenced him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life. <br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

The Miscellaneous Case was allowed exparte on 03.04.1983. The petitioner thereafter filed Execution Case No.1 of 1986 in the Court of the learned District Judge, Mymensingh which was subsequently transferred to the Artha Rin Adalat by an administrative order of the learned District Judge and renumbered as Execution Case No.80 of 1991. The petitioner being the bidder of auction purchase of the suit land obtained the sale certificate and while making attempt to take possession of the said building with police help the respondent filed a Transfer Case being Miscellaneous Case No.74 of 1997 before the Court of the learned District Judge, Mymensingh alleging that all orders passed in the execution case was without jurisdiction and the learned District Judge by order dated 08.04.1999 held that in view of the decisions reported in 47 DLR 158 and 16 BLD (AD) 231 Artha Rin Adalat is not permitted to prosecute the execution case. In the said execution case the decree-holder filed an application for amendment of the execution petition and the executing court by impugned dated 07.05.2008 allowed the amendment of execution petition which reads as follows: "উক্ত কর্পোরেশন বিগত ৩/৪/৮৩ ইং তারিখে একতরফা সূত্রে এই ডিক্রি প্রাপ্ত হইয়াছে। মূল মোকদ্দমায় দায়িক পক্ষ প্রতিদ্বন্দ্বিতা করেন নাই। একতরফা ডিক্রিতে আদায়কাল কত সুদ ডিক্রিদার পক্ষ প্রাপ্ত হইবেন উল্লেখ থাকায় শুধুমাত্র সুদের হিসাব করিয়া ডিক্রীদার সেই অংকটি ডিক্রীজারীর দরখাস্তে সন্নিবেশন করার আবেদন করিয়াছেন। ইহাতে আপত্তি করার কোন সুযোগ নাই। এমতাবস্থায়, দায়িক পক্ষের সময়ের আবেদন নাকচ করা হইল। পক্ষান্তরে, ডিক্রীদারপক্ষে সংশোধনী আবেদন মঞ্জুর করা হইল। ডিক্রী জারীর দরখাস্ত ও রেজিষ্ট্রি প্রার্থিত মতে সংশোধন করা হউক।"<br/><br/>The respondent being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and order dated 07.05.2008 preferred the Civil Revision No.3099 of 2008 before the High Court Division and a Division Bench of the High Court Division by the judgment and order dated 28.06.2009 made the Rule absolute.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division, the petitioner preferred the instant civil petition for leave to appeal before this Court.<br/><br/>Mr. Shaheed Alam, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner submits that the petitioner filed the application for amendment under Order 21, Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure so that actual amount due to be shown in the decree because this would not affect the claim of the petitioner and the same was reasonable and fair, but the High Court Division wrongly appreciated the fact and set aside the order passed by the learned District Judge. He then submits that the petitioner was a party in auction sale and as such respondent has no locus-standi to raise objection as to the amount which will not affect the interest of the respondent. He finally submits that the respondent without filing any application to set aside the auction cannot raise any objection to an order passed under order 21 rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure, but the High Court Division wrongly passed the impugned order which has affected the interest of House Building Finance Corporation and as such leave should be granted.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Mozibar Rahman, the learned Advocate-on-Record for the respondent submits that there is no illegality in the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division and as such no interference is called for. The learned Advocate-on-Record for the respondent having referred to Order 21, Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure submits that Rule 17(1) of Order 21 of the Code refers only to the requirements of Rules 11-14 as may be applicable to the case and in the instant case the alleged defect in execution application has no reference to Rules 11-14 of Order 21, inasmuch as the exparte order dated 04.03.1983 passed by the learned District Judge in Miscellaneous Case No.154 of 1982 does not contain any direction upon the defendant respondent to pay interest from the date of the exparte order till realization and as such this Rule does not apply to allow the petitioner to rectify the mistake in the application for execution and that the learned Judges of the High Court Division having considered this aspect of the matter rejected the prayer for amendment of the application for execution in making the Rule absolute by the impugned judgment and order, as such there is no illegality in the impugned judgment and order. Mr. Md. Mozibar Rahman having referred to the order dated 03.04.1983 passed by the learned District Judge submits that since there is no specific order for interest till realization of the decreetal amount, the learned District Judge as an executing Court has clearly travelled beyond the order which is to be executed by imposing interest till realization of the amount and as such the High Court Division committed no illegality in making the Rule absolute by setting aside the order passed by the learned District Judge.<br/><br/>We have heard the learned Advocates appearing for both the parties, perused the leave petition, impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division and all other connected papers on record. In the instant case the petitioner filed Miscellaneous Case No.154 of 1982 in the Court of learned District Judge, Mymensingh against the judgment-debtor-respondent under Article 27 of President's Order No.7 of 1973 for realization of Tk.6,03,407.02 which includes the principal with interest till 31.10.1982. The decree holder-petitioner obtained exparte order on 03.04.1983. Thereafter on the basis of the said exparte decree Execution Case No.1 of 1986 was filed in the Court of the learned District Judge, Mymensingh which was subsequently transferred to the Court of Artha Rin Adalat by an administrative order of the learned District Judge and renumbered as Execution Case No.80 of 1991. The respondent having come to know about the Execution Case filed a a Transfer Case being Miscellaneous Case No.74 of 1997 in the Court of the learned District Judge, Mymensingh to bring the said Execution Case before the learned District Judge. The learned District Judge upon hearing both the parties by the order dated 08.04.1999 allowed the Miscellaneous Case No.74 of 1997 and brought back the Execution Case to his file which was renumbered as Execution Case No.1 of 1999. While the Execution Case was pending in the Court of learned District Judge, decree holder-petitioner on 03.04.2008 filed an application in the said Execution Case under Order 21, Rule 17 read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure for amendment of the Execution Petition with a calculation sheet for passing an order of interest till realization of the money.<br/><br/>The respondent filed an application for time on 07.05.2008 to enable them to file written objection against the said amendment petition. But the learned District Judge without giving the respondent any opportunity for hearing allowed the petition for amendment by the order dated 07.05.2008. The relevant provisions of Order 21, Rule 17 reads as under:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>R.17. Procedure on receiving application for execution of decree. (1) On receiving an application for the execution of a decree as provided by rule 11, sub-rule (2), the Court shall ascertain whether such of the require-ments of rules 11 to 14 as may be applicable to the case have been complied with; and, if they have not been complied with, the Court shall allow the defect to be remedied then and there or within a time to be fixed by it. If the defect is not remedied within the time fixed the Court may reject the application.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(2) Where an application is amended under the provisions of sub-rule (1), it shall be deemed to have been an application in accordance with law and presented on the date when it was first presented.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(3) Every amendment made under this rule shall be signed or initialed by the Judge.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(4) When the application is admitted, the Court shall enter in the proper register a note of the application and the date on which it was made, and shall, subject to the provisions hereinafter contained, order execution of the decree according to the nature of the application:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Provided that, in the case of decree for the payment of money, the value of the property attached shall, as nearly as may be, correspond with the amount due under the decree.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Order 21, Rule 11(2) provides for written application for execution of decree which shall be in writing signed and verified by the applicant or by some other persons proved to the satisfaction of the Court to be acquainted with the facts of the case and shall contain in a tabular form, some relevant particulars, including the number of the suit, names of the parties, the date of the decree, the amount of the interest (if any) due upon the decree or other relief granted thereby, together with particular of any cross decree, the amount of cost (if any) awarded etc. <br/><br/>It appears that the executing court by the order dated 07.05.2008 allowed the amendment of execution petition to the effect that the judgment-debtor-defendant-respondent is to pay interest from the date of the order till realization. In this context it is pertinent to reproduce the operating part of the exparte order dated 03.04.1983 which reads as under:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"> <br/><strong>“Claim Proved.</strong><br/><strong><u>Ordered.</u></strong><br/>That the Misc. Case be allowed exparte with cost. The property at schedule-‘B’ is and be hereby attached. The O.P. shall pay up the entire dues within 60 days from the date failing which the property at schedule ‘B’ shall be put on sale for realisation of the dues payable by the O.P.<br/>Sd/- A. Jaman,<br/>District Judge, Mymensingh.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>On perusal of the aforesaid order it appears that the learned District Judge did not pass any order directing the judgment-debtor-defendant-respondent to pay interest from the date of the order till realization. In this context it is pertinent to reproduce section 34 of Code of Civil Procedure,1908 below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“34.(1) Where and in so far as a decree is for the payment of money, the Court may, in the decree, order interest at such rate as the Court deems reasonable to be paid on the principal sum adjudged, from the date of the suit to the date of the decree, in addition to any interest adjudged on such principal sum for any period prior to the institution of the suit, with further interest at such rate as the Court deems reasonable on the aggregate sum so adjudged, from the date of the decree to the date of payment, or to such earlier date as the Court thinks fit.<br/>(2) Where such a decree is silent with respect to the payment of further interest on such aggregate sum as aforesaid from the date of the decree to the date of payment or other earlier date, the Court shall be deemed to have refused such interest, and a separate suit therefore shall not lie.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>While interpreting section 34 of the Code of Civil Procedure,1908 this Division in Sonali Bank vs. Mahbubul Amin and another, 42 DLR (AD) 107 stated as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“11. It will be seen that sub-section (1) above speaks of separate interest for three different stages which may be awarded by a Court where and in so far as a decree is for the payment of money. The Court may order interest to be paid on the principal sum adjudged (1) from the date of suit to the date of the decree, in addition to (2) any interest adjudged on such principal sum from any period to the institution of the suit with (3) further interest on the aggregate sum so adjudged from the date of the decree to the date of payment, or to such earlier date as the Court thinks fit.<br/>12. Sub-section (2) clearly refers to the interest mentioned in item (3) above i.e. interest from the date of the decree and says that if a decree is silent with respect to such interest the Court shall be deemed to have refused the same, and a separate suit therefore shall not lie.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In Kadam Rosul Silicate Works and others vs. Sonali Bank, 42 DLR (AD) 294 it was reiterated in para 10 as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The terms of the decree being silent as to further interest or any interest, it must be held under section 34(2) CPC that the court has refused such interest.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Interest under section 34 of CPC is not a statutory right payment of which can be claimed by the decree holder automatically as held by this Division in Janata Bank vs. M./S. Wahid Enterprise (Pvt) Ltd., 1995 BLD (AD) 51 in the following terms:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“As to interest under section 34 of the Code of Civil Procedure or as to cost of the suit and appeal plaintiff does not have any statutory right to be paid automatically. The discretion lies with the Court.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Above decisions of this Division clearly show that the High Court Division rightly found that the order dated 07.05.2008 allowing the prayer for amendment of the application for execution suffers from error of law which has resulted in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice. Accordingly, the Rule was made absolute.<br/> <br/>In view of the aforesaid findings and observations we are of the view that there is no illegality in the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division calling for any interference by this Court. In the premises, we do not find any merit in the leave petition.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the leave petition is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

The High Court Division exercising its jurisdiction under article 102 will not advise the Tribunal as to the procedure for implementation of its decisions and orders. The Tribunal will take decisions itself. If the Tribunal is wrong in its decisions, the Administrative Appellate Tribunal will correct the same, for an appeal lies against “any order or decision of the Tribunal” to the Administrative Appellate Tribunal.

Muzammel Hossain, CJ:</strong><br/><br/>Civil Appeal Nos.87-94 of 2001, by leave, at the instance of the writ-respondents-appellants are directed against the Judgment and order dated 08.11.2000 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Writ Petition Nos. 2295, 2508, 2509, 3559, 3804, 4343, 4222 and 4107 of 2000 making the Rules absolute.<br/><br/>These appeals have been heard together and are being disposed of by this common Judgment as they do involve common questions of laws and facts. Respondent No. 1 of all these appeals filed 8 writ petitions seeking certain directions upon the present appellant to implement the decisions and orders passed by the administrative Tribunal in favour of present respondent No. 1 in their respective cases. For the sake of brevity, we would like to state the facts of Civil Appeal No.87 of 2001 corresponding to Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.1145 of 2000 arising out of Writ Petition No.2295 of 2000.<br/><br/>The facts leading to this appeal, in short, are that the respondent No.1 as the petitioner filed writ petition No.2295 of 2000 before the High Court Division impleading this appellant as respondent No.1 and the respondent Nos.2 to 4 as the respondent Nos. 2 to 4 for a direction upon the respondents for immediate implem-entation of the judgment dated 22.09.1998 passed by the learned Member, Administrative Tribunal, Dhaka in Administrative Tribunal Case No.203 of 1992.<br/><br/>Background of the Administrative Tribunal Case No.203 of 1992 was that the Bangladesh Public Service (First) Commission through its notification 4 dated 23.06.1972 published in the Official Gazette dated 06.07.1972 invited applications from freedom fighters for recruitment of 350 officers through Special Superior Service Examinations. The petitioner’s Roll No. was 151. He stood 154<sup>th</sup> in the combined merit list and was appointed in the IMS Cadre where he joined on 31.07.1973. He was trained at home and abroad and passed the prescribed examination after which he was confirmed in the service on 31.07.1975 through notification published in the Official Gazette dated 28.04.1977. He was posted in the Bangladesh Steel and Engineering Corporation on deputation and he was working there. In order to meet the requirement of good number of trained and experienced officers the Government abolished the IMS Cadre and absorbed majority of its members in the BCS (Admn) Cadre in 1982. The Government, in consultation with the public service commission amended the BCS Recruitment Rules,1981 and promulgated the Industrial Management Service (Abolition, Absorption and Fixation of Seniority) Rules,1982 and then absorbed 150 officers of the said abolished IMS Cadre in the BCS (Admn) Cadre vide Notification dated 04.11.1982. In the same way 8 officers of the abolished IMS were absorbed in the BCS (police), 3 in BCS (Railway), 2 in BCS(Foreign), 5 in BCS(Secretariat) and 16 in BCS (Postal). Later on the Government amended the Industrial Management Service (Abolition, Absorption and Fixation of Seniority) Rules, 1982. The Government issued notification dated 26.12.1981 to award time scale to those officers who were eligible for promotion but could not be awarded promotion concomitantly. Accordingly considering him eligible for promotion, the Government awarded him time scale and placed him in MNS-VI (Tk.1400-2225) vide order dated 20.10.1983. The Government posted him as Thana Nirbahi Officer of Pirojpur vide notification dated 14.07.1983, where he joined on 24.07.1983. Thereafter he was successively appointed as ADC and ADM by the Government. While he was working as ADM at Bogra the Government vide notification dated 14.03.1990 awarded promotion to 76 officers of BCS (Admn) Cadre to MNS-V (Tk.3700-4825/-) wherein his case was not considered and thus he was superseded by 2 officers who were junior to him. Then he submitted a grievance petition on 29.08.1990 to the Cabinet Secretary and the Secretary, Ministry of Establishment praying for redress. During the pendency of the said petition the Government awarded promotion to 21 officers of BCS (Admn) Cadre to MNS-V (3700-4825/- whereby he was illegally superseded vide notification dated 28.08.1990 without disposing of his grievance petition. The Government vide notification dated 08.02.1992 awarded promotion to 277 officers of BCS (Admn) Cadre to the post of Deputy Secretary, some of whom being junior to him superseded him. Thereafter the Government vide notification dated 18.02.1992 awarded promotion to 1 officer of the BCS (Admn) Cadre to the post of Deputy Secretary superseding him again. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid supersession he submitted a grievance petition to the Government on 27.02.1992 through proper channel. But without disposing of the said petition the Government vide notifications dated 16.03.1992 and 29.09.1992 awarded promotion to some of the officers to the post of Deputy Secretary, superseding him illegally. By way of the said supersession he was turned junior to those who were, in fact, junior to him and thus his seniority was adversely affected. Since the aforesaid promotion orders were made adversely affecting his seniority, without consulting the Public Service Commission as required under article 140(2)(c) he was compelled to challenge the aforesaid impugned orders before the Court. Being superseded illegally again and failing to get justice from the Government he had no other alternative than to take shelter of the judiciary by filing A.T. Case No.203 of 1992. Thereafter, the Government awarded him promotion vide notification dated 09.19.1995 to the post of Deputy Secretary, without giving seniority with retrospective effect and awarded promotion to a junior officer vide notification dated 23.07.1998 to the post of Joint Secretary. The petitioner also challenged the aforesaid two promotion orders dated 09.10.1995 and 23.07.1998 by making amendment of the application.<br/><br/>The appellant-Government as the respondent No.1 and the writ respondent Nos.17, 44, 63 and 92 contested the Administrative Tribunal Case by filing two separate written statements denying all the material allegations made in the application stating that the case is barred by limitation and defect of parties and as such not maintainable in the eye of law; that as per existing provisions of law the condition of five years experience in the senior scale with ten years service had to be fulfilled for promotion to MNS-V and to the post of Deputy Secretary which the petitioner-respondent did not fulfill at that time and as such petitioner’s case should not be considered for promotion at that time. When he was found to be suitable he was awarded promotion. So article 29 of the Constitution has not been violated in the case of the petitioner-respondent. However, the respondent No.1 was absorbed in the BCS (Administration) Cadre Service after ten years. The appellant-Government committed no illegality by promoting the opposite parties of the A.T. Case. The respondent No.1 filed the instant case on false allegations which is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>The Administrative Tribunal by judgment and order dated 22.09.1998 allowed the case and declared that the respondent No.1 is entitled to be promoted to MNS-V on 14.03.1990 to the post of Deputy Secretary on 08.02.1992 and to the post of Joint Secretary on 23.07.1998 on which date the petitioner’s junior Mr. Md. Tazul Islam was promoted to those posts.<br/><br/>Some junior colleagues who were opposite parties in A.T. Case No.203 of 1992 simply filed a time barred appeal being A.A.T. Case No.72 of 1999 on 19.07.1999 before the Administrative Appellate Tribunal long after nine months with malafide intention to keep the whole matter pending for an indefinite period. The Administrative Appellate Tribunal after hearing both the parties by the judgment and order dated 19.03.2000 rejected the memorandum of appeal.<br/><br/>After the judgment of the Tribunal the respondent No.1’s Advocate Mr. S.A.M. Mahbub Elahi, Advocate, Supreme Court of Bangladesh on 28.03.2000 issued a notice demanding justice to the respondent No.1 (appellant herein) with a request to do justice in implementing the judgment and order dated 22.09.1998 in A.T. Case No.203 of 1992. But no action was taken as yet in this behalf.<br/><br/>Thereafter the present respondent No.1 of all these appeals preferred 8 writ petitions before the High Court Division seeking direction upon the respondent-appellant to implement the judgment and order passed by the Administrative Tribunal in favour of the petitioners-respondents in their respective cases. A Division Bench of the High Court Division by judgment and order dated 08.11.2000 made the Rules absolute and directed the writ petitioner-respondent No.1 to file application to the Administrative Tribunal for making a complaint under section 166 of the Penal Code against the officers who failed to implement the Tribunal’s order or orders in question and forwarding the same to a Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the offences.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division in 8 writ-petitions the writ respondents-appellants preferred 8 appeals being Appeal Nos.87-94 of 2001 with leave of the court before the Appellate Division.<br/><br/>Leave was granted to consider the following submissions of the learned Advocates for the petitioners:</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman"><li style="text-align:justify">“That having regard to the admitted fact that no attempt was made for implementation of the decision by applying before the Tribunal as provided under the Administrative Tribunals Act,1981, the High Court Division erred in holding without any basis, “Therefore, we hold that neither Rule 7 of the Administrative Tribunals Rules read with Order 21 Rule 32 of the Code Civil Procedure nor the aforesaid power of the Administrative Appellate Tribunal to punish for contempt is sufficient for effective relief to get the orders of the Administrative Tribunal executed within a reasonable time.” Having regard to the decision reported 44 DLR (AD) 111 in the case of Majibur Rahman vs. Bangladesh, declaring bar of jurisdiction in respect of terms and conditions of service of persons in the service of the Republic by way of writ-petition and the decision reported in 41 DLR 538 on the exact point of implementation of the decision of the Administrative Tribunal also clearly holding that writ for such remedy was not maintainable, the High Court Division erred in entertaining the writ petition as the same amounts to uncertainly in respect of law relating to persons in the service of the Republic causing chaos and confusion.”</li><li style="text-align:justify">“That there being specific provision for implementation of the decision of the Administrative Tribunal, the High Court Division erred in law in passing an order for implementation of the decision of the Administrative Tribunal in exercising its writ jurisdiction. The judgment and order directing the writ-petitioner to make a complaint under section 166 of the Penal Code against the Government officials is unwarranted in the facts and circumstances of the case.”</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">The issue involved in all the civil appeals is whether the High Court Division correctly directed the writ-petitioners-respondents individually to file an application before the Administrative Tribunal for making a complaint under section 166 of the Penal code against the officer/officers of the Government who failed to implement the decisions of the Tribunal and whether a direction could be given for forwarding a complaint to a Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the offence.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Shohrowardi, learned Deputy Attorney General appearing on behalf  of the appellant in all the appeals, submits that the Administrative Tribunals Rules provides for a specific provision in rule 7 read with Order XXI Rule 32 of the Code of Civil Procedure for implementation of Administrative Tribunal’s decision and that in case  of failure of the Administrative Tribunal, the Administrative Appellate Tribunal has the power to implement the decision of the Administrative Tribunal by resorting to the provision of contempt contained in section  10A of the Act and as such, there is no scope for filing any criminal case for imple-mentation of the decision of the Administrative Tribunal. He further submits that where there is a specific provision for implementation of the decision of the Administrative Tribunal, the High Court Division erred in law in passing an order for implementation of the decision of the Administrative Tribunal in exercise of its writ jurisdiction directing the Administrative Tribunal to make a complaint   under section 166 of the penal code against the Government officials and as such, the impugned judgment and order not being tenable in law is liable to be set aside.<br/><br/>Before addressing the issue raised in these appeals, it is necessary to go through Rule 7 of the Administrative Tribunals Rules,1982 which runs as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“7. Execution of decisions and orders of a Tribunal-A Tribunal shall, for the purpose of execution of its decisions and orders follows, as far as practicable, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure,1908 (V of 1908), relating to the execution of a decree.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It is also pertinent to quote section 10A of the Administrative Tribunals Act which is in the following terms:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“10A.   Contempt of Tribunals-(1) The Administrative Appellate Tribunal shall have power to punish for contempt of its authority or that of any Administrative Tribunal, as if it were the High Court Division of the Supreme Court.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The salient findings of the High Court Division are quoted below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“There is no doubt that the orders of the Administrative Tribunal must be executed immediately to remedy the grievances of the service-holders so that they can do their job efficiently having no injured feeling. Delay in formal Court proceedings has given rise to a new concept of alternative dispute resolution mechanism. Accepting this principle our Constitution has made provision for Administrative Tribunals in Article 117. Therefore, we hold that neither Rule 7 of the Administrative Tribunals Rules read with Order 21 Rule 32 of the Code of Civil Procedure nor the aforesaid power of the Administrative Tribunal to punish for contempt is sufficient or effective to get the orders of the Administrative Tribunal executed within a reasonable time. For example, it will be a long process for a peon to execute the order of the Administrative Tribunal setting aside the order of his dismissal from service passed by the Deputy Commissioner of a district and further it will be hazardous for the peon to put the Deputy Commissioner into the civil prison. And who is to bear the cost? The answer is that poor peon.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Therefore, it is not difficult to conclude that the aforesaid process for the execution of the orders of the Administrative Tribunal are not sufficient so as to hold that these writ-petition are not maintainable. The cited decision did not consider this aspect and as such it has not binding effect.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The High Court Division concluded that the appellants had committed an offence punishable under section 166 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>Record reveals that no effort was made before the Administrative Tribunal for implementing its decisions and orders by resorting to the provision of Rule 7 of the Administrative Tribunals Rules. Execution of the decisions and orders of the Administrative Tribunal is a matter within its exclusive jurisdiction. Administrative Tribunal is the sole arbiter of the procedure with regard to execution of its decisions and orders. The Administrative Tribunal functions under the constitutional mandate as contained in Article 117 of the Constitution having the power to devise its own method and procedure to execute its decisions and orders. Having considered Rule 7 of the Rules, it appears that the Tribunal is not barred from following any other procedure. The Tribunal will follow the provision of the Code of Civil Procedure relating to the execution of the decree “as far as practicable” but when it is not practicable to do so, the Tribunal is not powerless. The decisions and the orders of the Tribunal are not meaningless. Section 8 of the Act says that its decisions and the orders are “binding on the parties”. The High Court Division exercising its jurisdiction under article 102 will not advise the Tribunal as to the procedure for implementation of its decisions and orders. The Tribunal will take decisions itself. If the Tribunal is wrong in its decisions, the Administrative Appellate Tribunal will correct the same, for an appeal lies against “any order or decision of the Tribunal” to the Administrative Appellate Tribunal. The questions and problems relating to execution will have to be resolved by the Administrative Tribunal or the Administrative Appellate Tribunal, as the case may be, within the ambit of the Acts and the Rules framed thereunder.<br/><br/>Soon after exhausting the procedure laid down in Rule 7, the aggrieved party has a further remedy before the Administrative Appellate Tribunal. What is important to note here is that the Administrative Appellate Tribunal has the power to punish for contempt of its authority and of any Administrative Tribunal as provided in section 10A of the Act.<br/><br/>In the case of Saifur Rahman vs. Bangladesh through the Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture and others, (1989) 41 DLR 538 the High Court Division observed, “As of today, the Administrative Tribunals Act,1980 is a self-contained and composite legislation. Both the execution of the decisions and orders of a Tribunal and violation thereof are well taken care of by the legislation. It does not need the additional umbrella of this Court’s jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution for implementation of the decisions and orders of the Administrative Tribunal.”<br/><br/>In spite of existence of Rule 7 of the Rules and section 10A of the Act, if it is made a practice to additionally file a complaint under section 166 of the Penal Code by the Administrative Tribunal for the purpose of implementing its decisions and orders, then the affected persons will themselves be the ultimate losers. In such a situation, the government officials against whom an adverse order has been passed by the Administrative Tribunal will not care to execute the Tribunal’s decisions and the order until the High Court Division directs the Administrative Tribunal to file a complaint under section 166 of the Penal Code. The Government officials may wait till such a direction is given by the High Court Division and such a practice will render the Administrative Tribunal an ineffective and useless body.<br/><br/>We are of the view that the Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980 ought to be interpreted in such a manner that the Act is consistent with the constitutional provisions and legislative intent and may provide for complete and self- sufficient remedy to the affected parties. <br/><br/>We are of the opinion that the respondents cannot avail themselves of the remedy provided under article 102 of the Constitution for having a direction upon the Administrative Tribunal to file a complaint under section 166 of the Penal Code. The High Court Division has not been entrusted with the power of deciding as to how the decisions and orders of the Administrative Tribunals will be executed. The execution of the decisions and the orders of the Administrative Tribunal primarily lies with the Tribunal itself and thereafter, with the Administrative Appellate Tribunal.<br/><br/>If not otherwise barred, writ-petitioner-respondent No.1 of all the appeals can still go to the Administrative Tribunal for execution of its decisions and orders. The Administrative Tribunal is quite competent to come to a decision about the mode of implementation of its own decisions and orders. In case of failure, the said writ-petitioner-respondent has been given further remedy under section 10A of the Act.<br/><br/>In the light of the findings made above, the judgment and order delivered by the High Court Division cannot sustain. Accordingly, all the appeals are allowed and the impugned judgment and order is set aside with the observations made in the body of the judgment.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Abdul Wahhab Miah, J:</strong></u></h4><h4 style="text-align: justify;">This appeal, by leave, has arisen out of the Judgment and order dated the 31<sup>st</sup> day of August, 2006 passed by a learned Judge of the Single Bench of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.163 of 2004 making the Rule absolute</h4><div style="text-align: justify;">Facts necessary for disposal of this appeal are that the present appellant as plaintiff filed Other Suit No.108 of 2001 in the Court of Assistant Judge, Sitakunda, Chittagong for declaration of title to the suit land and for further declaration that P.S and B.S Khatian in respect of the suit land was wrongly prepared and also for a direction for recording her name in the P.S and B.S Khatians.<br/><br/>The case of the plaintiff, in short, was that the suit land originally belonged to Gagan Chandra Shil who sold the same to Nagendra Kumar by registered Kabala No.231 dated 21.01.1912. R.S Khatian No.2 was prepared in the name of Nagendra Kumar. Nagendra  Kumar died leaving behind the plaintiff as the only heir and she has been possessing the suit land by cultivating paddy, planting trees and producing other crops and by paying rents. On 13-9-2001, when the plaintiff’s son went to the Tahshil office for paying rent, Tahshilder refused to accept the rent on the plea that P.S and B.S Khatians were not prepared in her name. Thereafter, the plaintiff on obtaining the certified copies of the Khatians was confirmed that those were prepared in the name of the Government in the Khas Khatian in P.S and R.S Khatian No.1 in dag Nos.219 and 311 respectively.<br/><br/>The suit was contested by the defendants by filing a joint written statement contending. inter alia, that the suit land was recorded in the name of Nagendra Kumar in R.S Khatian No.2 and R.S. dag No.219. The suit land was sold in auction for arrear of rents and the government purchased the same and accordingly, the suit land was recorded in the P.S. and the B.S. Khatian in Khas Khatian No.1 in the name of the government. In Case No.2 of 2002, proposal was made for settling the suit land to Samabay Samity Limited for long term.<br/><br/>The trial Court considering the evidence on record decreed the suit by judgment and decree dated 28.05.2002. Against the decree of the trial Court, the defendants preferred Other Appeal No.459 of 2002 before the District Judge, Chittagong. The learned Joint District Judge. 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Chittagong by his Judgment and decree dated 29.09.2003 allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the Judgment and degree of the appellate Court, the plaintiff preferred Civil Revision No.169 of 2009 before the High Court Division and a learned Judge of the Single Bench of the High Court Division by the impugned judgment and order made the Rule absolute, set aside the judgment and decree of the appellate Court and sent the suit back on remand to the trial Court with direction to frame an issue as to “Whether plaintiff Bashanti Protima Nandi can inherit the suit land or not under Hindu Law” with the observations:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“ Admittedly the lower Court did not frame any” issue regarding the inheritance of plaintiff under Hindu Law and neither the learned Assistant Judge nor the learned Joint District Judge discussed about this vital point of inheritance of plaintiff in their Judgment, So, as provision of Section 88 and Section XII of Hindu Law plaintiff’s alleged son Bablu Nandi must be examined by the lower Court to determine the right title of plaintiff petitioner in the suit land. For the purpose learned lower Court is also to frame an issue”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Leave was granted by this Court to consider following submission of the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the High Court Division committed error in sending back the suit on remand as it is quite unnecessary to frame an issue as to within plaintiff got the suit land by inheritance as this issue is covered by the issue framed by the trial Court to the effect as to whether the plaintiff has title and possession in the suit land and further this new point regarding framing of issue is not based on the pleading of the parties and so remand can not be ordered for decision on that point and rather in the interest of justice the High Court Division ought to have decided the case on merit on the evidence or (sic, it would be on) record and further in the instant case no body other than Government raised any objection as to the claim of the plaintiff.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Mr. Abdul Qyayum, learned counsel appearing for the appellant, has made his submission in the light of the leave granting order.<br/><br/>Mr. Biswajit Deb Nath, learned Deputy Attorney General, appearing for the respondents, tried to make out a new point that whether the plaintiff is the daughter of Nagendra needs to be decided in the suit afresh, the High Court Division rightly sent the suit back on remand to the trial Court. There being no merits in the appeal, the same  be dismissed.<br/><br/>From the impugned judgment and order, it appears that the High Court Division without considering the case of the respective parties and discussing the evidence on record raised a new point that an issue as quoted hereinbefore need be framed and decided. But the contesting defendants did not raise any such question in their written statement nor did they raise any issue nor any point in the Courts below in that regard. From the judgment of the trial Court, it also appears that issue No.2 was framed to the effect “bvwjkx f~wg‡Z ev`xwbi ¯^Z¡ ¯^v_© `Lj Av‡Q wK-bv<strong> ?Ó|</strong> We are of the view that this issue squarely covers the issue as suggested by the High Court Division. From the judgment of the trial Court, it further appears that it decided issue No.2 in favour of the plaintiff on detailed discussion of the evidence on record. However, the appellate. Court took a reverse view. Since the two Courts took two different views and the entire records were before the High Court Division, the learned Judge of the Single Bench was obliged to decide whether the appellate Court was correct in reversing the judgment and decree of the trial Court in view of the pleading of the respective party and the evidence adduced by them, Instead, he sought to find out a new point and thus raise a new issue beyond the pleading of the defendants and that suo motu too. It needs to be mentioned that in para 1 of the plaint, the plaintiff categorically stated that “b‡M›`ª Kygvi iw¶Z bvwjkx f’wg mn Acivci f~wgi ¯^Z¡ `L‡j LvKv Ae¯’vq gviv †M‡j Zvnv cyÎeZ©x Kb¨v ev`xwb Iqvwik my‡Î cÖvß nb<strong>|Ó </strong>The defendants in para 10 of their written statement just gave a general denial of the statements made in the plaint as a whole. Then in para 11 under the head, actual facts the defendants did neither deny the assertion of the plaintiff made in para 1 of the plaint nor said that the plaintiff was not the daughter of Nagendara.<br/><br/>In exercising jurisdiction under section 115 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, the revisional Court is not at all permitted to raise a new point which fundamentally relates determination of facts. The duty of the revisional Court in case of a judgment of reversal is to see whether the appellate Court reversed the decree of the trial Court adverting its findings and decision on proper and correct appreciation of the evidence on record and the law governing the field. But the learned judge of the Single Bench miserably failed to discharge this obligation. In view of the above, we find no other alternative but to send the matter back to the High Court Division to hear the revision afresh and dispose of the same in accordance with law on the evidence on record keeping in mind the observations made above. And in no case, the High Court Division shall send back the matter to either of the Courts below.<br/>In the result, the appeal is allowed. The impugned Judgment and order of the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.163 of 2004 is set aside and the matter is sent back to the High Court Division for hearing afresh and dispose of the same on merit in accordance with law upon the evidence on record keeping in mind the observations made hereinbefore.<br/><br/>Let the revision be heard and disposed of by the Bench, presided over by Mr. A.K.M. Abdul Hakim, J., within 8 (eight) weeks from the date of receipt of this judgment.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> <br/> </div></div></div>

The said suit was subsequently renumbered as Family Suit No.128 of 2005. The plaintiff’s case, in short, is that the defendant Bhabotosh Kumar Roy  after the death of his first wife married the plaintiff according to Hindu Law on 6.8.2000 and  on that day the defendant  took the plaintiff to his house and started living there  as husband and wife. Although, their conjugal life was not happy one as the defendant used to  maltreat with her claiming dowry and ultimately  plaintiff filed Nari-O-Shishu Case against the defendant,   who got an order of acquittal in the said criminal case and  after being acquitted the plaintiff on 13.7.2005 made a declaration by  executing an  affidavit being No. 186 cancelling such marriage and thereafter, finally on 30.09.2005 the defendant refused to give any maintenance to the plaintiff and hence, the suit.<br/><br/>That the defendant contested the suit by filing a written statement denying all the material allegation of the plaint and contended inter alia that there was no presentation of gold or  cloth on 17.02.2000 at the house of the plaintiff as precondition of marriage nor there was marriage solemnization on 6.8.2000 according to Hindu rites at Kathin Kalibari Temple and as such, the suit  is  liable to be dismissed with cost as being false, and fabricated one.<br/>The learned Assistant Judge on the pleadings of the parties framed the following issues for determination:-</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the suit is maintainable in its present form or not ?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether marriage was solemnised  between the plaintiff and the defendant according to Hindu religious rites or not ?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the plaintiff is entitled to get relief, as prayed for ?</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">At the trial the plaintiff examined 4 witnesses and produced some documents which have been marked as exhibit 1 series and the defendant also examined 2 witnesses to prove their cases.<br/><br/>The learned Judge of the Family Court upon hearing both the parties  decreed the suit  on 01.7.2008, holding that the marriage was  solemnized between them on 6.8.2000 according to Hindu Law  and that plaintiff opposite party is legally entitled to get maintenance Tk. 2500/- per month during the period from October, 2005 to July, 2008 at a time along with a direction upon the defendant to pay Tk. 2500/- per month to the plaintiff for maintenance till her death within 1<sup>st</sup> 10 days  in each month . Against the said judgment and decree passed in Family suit No. 128 of 2005 the defendant petitioner preferred Family Appeal No. 20 of 2008 before the learned District Judge, Faridpur  which was heard by the learned Joint District Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Faridpur,  who by the impugned judgment and decree dated 23.5.2010 ( decree signed on 26.5.2010)    dismissed  the appeal on contest  with a direction upon the defendant-petitioner  to pay Tk. 2500/- per month during the period from 1.7.2005 to 1.7.2008 amounting to Tk. 1,50,000/- at a time and also to pay Tk. 2500/- per month for maintenance to the plaintiff till her death.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the aforesaid impugned judgment and decree dated 23.5.2010 (decree signed on 26.5.2010), the petitioner moved this Court and obtained the present Rule.<br/><br/>Mr. Goutom Kumar Roy, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner, submits that the learned Joint District Judge erred in law in passing the impugned judgment arbitrarily and the same has occasioned failure of justice. The learned Advocate further submits that  both the courts below  erred in law in decreeing  the suit  without properly considering the facts of the case and the case made out by the petitioner that no  marriage took place  between the parties  according to Hindu Law  and the same has occasioned failure of justice.<br/><br/>I have considered the submission of the learned Advocate for the petitioner and perused the record. The only material question for consideration in this case is, whether the Court of appeal  below has  committed any illegality  in affirming the judgment of the trial court on the finding that the marriage between the parties taken place according to Hindu Law.<br/><br/>For an answer to the question raised in this Rule it is necessary to examine the evidence on record. It appears that plaintiff herself was examined as PW-1, who in her evidence clearly stated that defendant Bhabotosh Kumar Roy after the death of his first wife married the plaintiff according to Hindu Law on 6.8.2000 and  on that date  the defendant  took the plaintiff to his house and lived  thereon as husband and wife. This witness to prove her marriage with the defendant in accordance with the Hindu Shastra exhibited a series of document including joint photographs. PW-2, PW-3 and  PW-4 in their respective evidence corroborated the evidence of PW-1 in respect of all material particulars.  On perusal of the  entire evidence on record  it is found that  in the instant case there is evidence enough on record both oral and documentary  to show that the marriage between the parties taken place and they lived together as married spouse.<br/><br/>It appears  that final court of fact, the appellate court has come to the conclusion that  the trial court rightly decided the suit in favour of the plaintiff  . In coming to this conclusion the said Court has  observed that : “বিবাদীপক্ষের জেরার জবা­ব বাদিনী সুস্পষ্টভা­ব বলিয়া­ছন যে, বিগত ০৬/০৮/২০০৮খ্রিঃ তারিখ হই­ত তিনি স্বামী-স»ী হিসা­ব  বিবাদীর বাড়ি­ত বসবাস করি­ত থা­কন এবং বিগত ১৭/০২/২০০৫ খ্রিঃ তারি­খর পূ­র্ব তাহা­দর ম­ধ্য হিন্দু শাস ম­ত বিবাহ না হই­লও বাদিনী প­ক্ষর দাখিলী প্রদর্শনী-১ হই­ত প্রদর্শনী ১(১২) চিহ্রিত ফ­টাগ্রাফগুলি ­কানরুপ আপত্তি ব্যতি­র­ক প্রমাণ ব্যবহূত হওয়ায় উক্ত ফ­টাগ্রাফগুলি পর্যা­লাচনায় দৃষ্ট হয় যে, বাদিনী ও বিবাদী পরস্পর অগ্নি সাক্ষী করিয়া ও সাতপাক ঘুরিয়া হিন্দু বিবা­হর ~~বধতা নিরুপ­নর আবশ্যকীয় শর্ত  পালন করিয়া­ছন এবং সেই­হতু বাদিনী ও বিবাদীর ম­ধ্য হিন্দু দায়ভাগ আইন অনুযায়ী ~~বধ বিবাহ সম্পন্ন হইয়া­ছ এবং বিবাদী প্রদর্শনী-২ চিহ্রিত এফি­ডভিট মূ­ল বিবাহ বন্ধন ছিন্ন করিবার ঘোষনা প্রদান করি­লও হিন্দু  দায়ভাগ আইনানুযায়ী তাহা­দর বিবাহ বি­চ্ছদ অনু­মাদিত না হওয়ায় তাহারা পরস্পর স্বামী-সী এবং সে­ক্ষ­ত্র বাদিনী পৃথক বসবাস করিয়াও আজীবন বিবাদীর নিকট হই­ত খোর­পাষ পাই­ত হকদার”  This being purely a finding of fact based on assessment of the  evidence on record.  It is needless to say that this Court normally does not interfere into the  question of fact arrived at by the appellate Court on consideration of the evidence on record.<br/><br/>Taking into  consideration of all these evidences on record including the exhibited photographs,  I am of the clear view that  there was a marriage ceremony between the parties in the temple of the deity kali in presence of many persons  according to Hindu Shastra and thus,  in the facts and circumstance of the case the plaintiff-opposite party is entitled to get maintenance from  1.7.2005 to till her death in accordance with Hindu Shastra. Therefore, I find no difficulty whatever in holding that in defending the Rule the plea as canvassed by Mr. Goutom Kumar Roy that no marriage was solemnised between the parties according to Hindu Law is fallacious as well as misconceived.<br/><br/>Both the Courts below on the facts of the case and on consideration of the legal position rightly settled the fact that there was a marriage ceremony between the parties in the temple of the deity kali in presence of many persons  according to Hindu Shastra.  The judgments of both the courts below are  found to be well-reasoned and well-supported by the materials on record. I, therefore, do not find any illegality or legal infirmity in the impugned  judgment occasioning failure of justice so as to justify interference by this Court exercising revisional power under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure.  As marriage in fact has been proved in this case, the plaintiff-opposite party is entitled to get maintenance  till her death in accordance with Hindu Shastra.<br/><br/>In the result, the Rule is discharged without any order as to costs.<br/><br/>The order of stay granted earlier by this Court stands vacated.<br/><br/>Let a copy of this judgment be communicated to the Courts concerned at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

The DCT issued notices under section 83(1) and 79 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1984 on the assessee. Thereafter, upon hearing, the DCT found that the assessee had obtained bank loan of Tk. 3,84,53,914/-, but the assessee transferred an amount of Tk. 75,90,734/-one of the same to some persons and sister concern without interest and that too was not for business purpose of the assessee and as such the interest thereon are not allowable expenses. With such findings, the DCT disallowed expenses of Tk. 15,00,000/-out of the bank’s interest paid by the assessee on the said loan. Being aggrieved, the assessee filed an appeal, being <strong>BuLl Bf£m fœ 73/®L¡w-16/1998-99,</strong> before the Commissioner of Taxes (Appeals),Taxes Appeal Zone-2, Dhaka (“the Commissioner of Appeal”, in short), whereupon the Commissioner of Appeal agreed in principle with the observations and decision of the DCT, but reduced disallowance from Tk. 15 lac to Tk.10 lac on the ground that the earlier disallowance was disproportionate to the amount of extra-business lending made by the assessee. The assessee then filed second appeal, being Income Tax Appeal No. 3850 of 1999-2000, before the Taxes Appellate Tribunal, Division Bench-2, Dhaka (“the Tribunal”, in brief). Thereupon, the Tribunal, in view of the judgment passed by the High Court Division in Income Tax Reference Application Nos.179/2002, 134/2002, 137/2002, 136/2002, 135/2002 and 446/2003 (the Commissioner of Taxes Vs. Concord Engineers), allowed the said appeal and thereby treated the entire bank interests as deductible expenditure of the assessee. This has resulted in this reference application at the instance of the Commissioner of Taxes concerned.<br/> <br/><strong>Reference Application No.180 of 2002 </strong>has arisen out of an order dated 20.5.2001 passed by the Taxes Appellate Tribunal, Division Bench-1, Dhaka in Income Tax Appeal No. 4995 of 2000-2001 in relation to the assessment year 1997-98.<br/> <br/>The facts, in brief, are that the assessee, East West Property Development Limited (hereinafter stated as “the assessee”) submitted its income tax return for the assessment year 1997-98 before the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes ,Circle-4, Directorate of Intelligence &amp; Investigation, Dhaka (“the DCT”, hereinafter) claiming deduction, amongst other expenses, of bank interest at Tk. 3,44,96,067/-on the bank loan obtained. The DCT found that the assessee had transferred an interest free loan of Tk.2,60,08,965/-to other companies (sister concern) and to a director and , as such, he disallowed proportionate interest of Tk. 44,00,941/-on the contention that if the assessee had not granted the aforesaid amount of loan to sister companies and a director, its expenses on account of interest would have decreased to that extent. Being aggrieved, the assessee filed Income Tax Appeal, being <strong>BuLl Bf£m fœ 25/®N¡x J ac¿¹ p¡x- 4/99-2000,</strong> before the Commissioner of Taxes (Appeals), Taxes Appeal Zone-3, Dhaka (“the Commissioner of Appeal,” in brief), whereupon the Commissioner of Appeal, agreeing with the view taken by the DCT, affirmed the said disallowances. The assessee then filed second appeal, being Income Tax Appeal No.4995 of 2000-2001, before the Taxes Appellate Tribunal, Division Bench-1, Dhaka (“the Tribunal”). The Tribunal, upon hearing, allowed the appeal and deleted the disallowance of bank interest on the loan advanced to the sister companies of the assessee, but not on the amount given to a director. This has resulted in the aforesaid income tax reference application at the instance of the Commissioner of Taxes concerned.<br/> <br/><strong><u>Questions initially framed: </u></strong><br/> <br/>Originally, the questions posed in Reference Application No.82 of 2002 for opinion by this court are as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“(i) Whether an expenditure, not incurred for the purpose of business of an assessee, is deductable in computing income from business of that assessee? </em><br/><em>(ii) Whether the expenditure incurred by the respondent on account of bank interest for the chunk of bank loan transferred to others is deductible under section 29(1)(iii) of Income Tax Ordinance,1984 from the income of the respondent ?” </em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">The questions originally framed in Reference Application No.180 of 2002 for answers of this court are as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“(i) Whether an expenditure, not incurred for the purpose of business of a company , is deductible in computing the income of that company for assessment to income tax ? </em><br/><em>(ii) Whether the expenditures incurred by the assessee on account of bank interest for the fund borrowed to replenish the fund allowed to be used without any commercial expediency by its sister concerns is deductible under section 29(1)(iii) of Income Tax Ordinance 1984 for assessment of income tax?” </em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Earlier Division Bench: </strong><br/> <br/>Both the reference applications were taken up for hearing by a Division Bench comprising of her Lady-ship Ms. Justice Zinat Ara and his Lordship Mr. Justice J.B.M. Hassan. The said Bench, after hearing the parties, disagreed with the views adopted earlier by two different Division Benches of the High Court Division in <strong><em>Commissioner of Taxes vs. Titas Gas Transmission, 46 DLR-332 </em></strong>and <strong><em>Concord Engineers vs. Commissioner of Taxes, 52 DLR-562 </em></strong>and, accordingly, referred both the applications to the Hon’ble Chief Justice in view of the provisions under Chapter-VII of the Supreme Court (High Court Division) Rules, 1973 vide order dated 07.02.2013. Thus, the reference applications have been sent to this Full Bench by the Hon’ble Chief Justice for disposal.<br/> <br/>It may be noted that while sending the instant Reference Applications to the Hon’ble Chief Justice, their Lordships vide order dated 07.02.2013 framed a new question of law, namely-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Whether an assessee is entitled to deduction of full bank interest on the loan obtained by the assessee for its own business but part of the borrowed capital/money was given to a sister company for the later’s use without assessee’s own business purpose as contemplated in section 29(1)(iii) of the Income Tax Ordinance,1984?” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Before framing the above question, the said Division Bench considered the decisions of this Court in <strong><em>M/S. Carew &amp; Co. Vs. Commissioner of Income Tax 20 DLR-318, Commissioner of Taxes Vs. Titas Gas Transmission 46 DLR-332 </em></strong>and the case of <strong><em>Concord Engineers Vs. Commissioner of Taxes, 52 DLR-362 </em></strong>(“<strong>Carew and Co</strong>,” <strong>Titas Gas</strong>” and <strong>Concord Engineers</strong>” cases, in short). Upon discussing the facts and circumstances of those three cases in short, their Lordships disagreed with the decisions in <strong>Titas Gas Case </strong>and <strong>Concord Engineers Case </strong>and finally concluded that the ratio decided in the <strong>Carew and Co. </strong>case was the correct position of law in the field and as such the point of difference should be decided by a larger bench.<br/><br/><strong>Submissions: </strong><br/> <br/>We have heard at length Mr. S. Rashed Jahangir, learned Deputy Attorney General, representing Commissioner of Taxes in both the matters and Mr. M.A.Noor, learned senior counsel, representing the respondent-East West Property Development Ltd in Income Tax Reference Application No. 180 of 2002. In the course of hearing, Mr. S. Rashed Jahangir, learned DAG, reiterated his submissions made earlier before the said Division Bench. He argues that since the loan was obtained by the assessee for the purpose of its own business, if any part of the same is transferred to any other entity or sister concern, it will not be entitled to get benefit of deductions of the interests paid on that part while calculating total income. In this regard, he relies on the proviso to Clause (iii) of sub-section (1) of Section 29 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1984 (“the said Ordinance”). Learned DAG further argues that since their Lordships in <strong>Titas Gas Case </strong>and <strong>Concord Engineers Case </strong>did not consider the said proviso to Clause (iii) of sub­section (1) of Section 29, the ratio decided in those cases should not be the guiding principles of law for reaching a proper conclusion. According to him, since the decision in <strong>Carew &amp; Co. Case </strong>was not placed before the said earlier Division Benches, the said Benches reached erroneous conclusion as regards the deduction of interests paid by the assessee on the part of loan obtained by it/him, though the said part was not used for its own business purpose.<br/> <br/>Mr. M. A. Noor, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the assessee-Concord Engineers, on the other hand, submits that the issue of applicability of the proviso to Clause (iii) of sub-section (1) of Section 29 was earlier raised before the same Bench which referred this matters for the Full Bench while deciding similar applications (ITRA Nos. 179,134-137/2002 and 446/2003) between the same parties on the same issue, and in those applications the same Bench did not accept it as a relevant provision and, accordingly, reached a conclusion on the premise that the said proviso was not applicable. According to Mr. Noor, the same Bench, later on, referred these matters for Full Bench virtually holding that since the proviso to Clause-(iii) of Section 29(1) was not considered in <strong>Titas Gas Case </strong>and <strong>Concord Engineers Case</strong>, the said decisions suffered from legal impropriety. Mr. Noor further argues that in the facts and circumstances of the case it is very much clear that the proviso to Clause-(iii) of Section 29(1) was never an issue in those reference applications and it is not an issue in the instant reference applications as well inasmuch as that the same is not applicable at all. Referring to the decisions of this Court in <strong>Titas Gas Case </strong>as well as the <strong>Concord Engineers Case</strong>, Mr. Noor submits that since the proviso was not applicable in the facts and circumstances of those cases, it was not required by their Lordships in those Division Benches to consider the said proviso and as such, according to him, the ratio decided in those cases are still good law.<br/> <br/><strong><u>Observations and Findings of the Court: </u></strong><br/> <br/>For better understanding of the relevant provisions of law involved in the instant reference applications, let us just make a cursory glance at the main provisions of the said Ordinance. Charging of income tax on the assessee has been mandated under <strong>Chapter IV </strong>of the said Ordinance under the heading <strong>‘Charge of Income Tax’</strong>. According to Section 16 under the said Chapter, income tax may be charged on the assessee in accordance with the procedure as provided by the statutes enacted by the parliament. The subsequent Chapters of the said Ordinance elaborated the provisions as to how the income of an assessee has to be calculated and how the said income is to be reduced upon deducting allowable expenses of the assessee from the total income for taxation purpose. Accordingly, Section 20 provides seven heads of income being (a) Salaries, (b) Interest on securities, (c) Income from house property, (d) Agricultural income, (e) Income from business or profession, (f) Capital gains and (g) Income from other sources. In the instant reference applications, we are concerned with the <strong>‘income from business or profession’ </strong>which is dealt with under Sections 28 and 29. While Section 28 describes different categories of income from business or profession, Section 29 provides as to how some expenses are allowed to be deducted from those income in calculating the total income of the assessee for the purpose of assessment of tax.<br/> <br/>Though the provisions under Section 29 are elaborate involving several issues, we are only concerned with Clause (iii) along with its proviso under sub-section (1) thereof. It appears that the said proviso to Clause (iii), which is the crux of dispute, is structured in a little bit complicated way. Sub­section (1) of Section 29 at first provides three clauses under it in almost same language and terms, though regarding different aspects. For better understanding of the structure of the said proviso to Clause (iii), we need to examine the similar provisos which have been used after Clause (i) and Clause-(ii) of the same sub-section (1) of Section 29 as it is necessary to understand the entire Clauses-(i), (ii) and (iii) along with the provisos to each of them for reaching a proper conclusion as to the correct interpretation of the said proviso to Clause-(iii). In view of above, the said three Clauses, namely Clauses-(i), (ii) and (iii) along with their provisos under sub-section (1) of Section 29, are quoted below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong>“29. Deductions from income from business or professions.-</strong><br/>(1)  In computing the income under the head “Income from business or profession”, the following allowances and deductions shall be allowed, namely:-<br/>(i) the amount of any rent paid for the premises in which the business or profession is carried on:<br/>Provided that if a substantial part of the premises is used by the assessee as a dwelling-house, the amount shall be a proportionate part of the rent having regard to the <em>proportionate annual value of the part so used; </em><br/>(ii) the amount paid for the repair of the hired premises in which the business or profession is carried on if the assessee has undertaken to bear the cost of such repair;<br/>Provided that if a substantial part of the premises is used by the assessee as a dwelling-house, the amount shall be a proportionate part of the <em>sum paid for such repair having regard to the proportionate annual value of the part so used; </em><br/>(iii) the amount of any interest paid or any profit shared with a bank run on Islamic principles in respect of capital borrowed for the purpose of the business <strong><em>or profession : </em></strong><br/>Provided that if any part of such capital relates to replenishing the cash or to any other asset transferred to a newly set up industrial undertaking or to an extension of an existing industrial undertaking <strong><u>whose income is exempted from payment of tax</u></strong><u>,</u> the amount shall be proportionate part of the interest so paid or the profit so shared having regard to the proportion of such capital so used:<br/><em>------------------------</em><br/><em>-----------------------” </em></div><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It appears from Clause-(i) of the said sub-section (1) that the Legislature allowed deduction of rent of an assessee paid for the premises in which the business or profession of the assessee is carried on. However, by the proviso to Clause-(i), that part of the said rent paid by the assessee has been excluded from such allowance which was used by the assessee not for the business purpose but for its/his dwelling house. By Clause-(ii), the same exercise has been done, namely that the cost of repair of the hired premises of the assessee has been allowed to be deducted from the total income except the part of the cost which has been spent for the repair of the dwelling part of the said premises. Interestingly, though Clause-(iii), as quoted above, provides for deduction of interest paid on the capital borrowed by the assessee for the purpose of the business or profession, the proviso to the said Clause-(ii) is a little bit more complicated than the previous two provisos discussed above. In other words, though the said proviso to Clause-(iii) used the same sentence style, the first part of the same mentioned three categories of uses of the said borrowed capital of the assessee, such as:—(a) the part relates to replenishing the cash or (b) the part relates to any other asset transferred to a newly setup industrial undertaking or (c) the part relates to extension of an existing industrial undertaking. After mentioning the said three categories of uses, the Legislature qualified the use of said categories by inserting the words “whose income is exempted from payment of tax”. Therefore, while enacting this proviso to Clause-(iii), the Legislature, though excluded the scope of allowance of deduction of interest on the borrowed capital in respect of three categories of uses, at the same time it qualified the said three categories by qualifying words “<u>whose income is exempted from </u>payment of tax”. Thus, it is clear that, the said proviso excluded the benefit from the assessee for deduction of interest paid in respect of the said three categories of uses of the borrowed capital by transferring any part of it to an entity whose income is exempted from payment of tax. Only in such uses, the assessee is not entitled to allowance of deduction of interest paid on the borrowed capital. This being the apparent meaning of the proviso to Clause-(iii) of sub-section (1) of Section 29, we have no option but to agree with the submissions of Mr. M.A. Noor that this proviso does not have any application at all in the facts and circumstances of the present cases in-as-much as that it is not the case of anybody that the recipient entity, which got the transferred capital of the assessee, was an entity which was exempted from payment of tax.<br/> <br/>It further appears that by enacting this proviso to Clause-(iii), the Legislature impliedly allowed an assessee to have the benefit of deduction of interests even after transferring some parts, out of the capital borrowed by it for its business purposes, to another entity. The only restriction under which it is not entitled to get exemption is where the said part of capital is given to an entity in the above mentioned three categories of uses when the income of the said recipient entity is exempted from payment of tax. Therefore, we are unable to agree with the submissions of learned DAG that an assessee, upon borrowing capital for its own business purposes, will not get the benefit of deduction of interest once any part of the said capital is transferred to another entity. The basic requirement of law is that so long as the assessee is borrowing capital for the purpose of its business and paying interest there-on, he is entitled to get allowance of deduction for the said interest paid by him. The only exception is in respect the said categories of uses in favour of an entity whose income is exempted from payment of tax. In <strong>Titas Gas case </strong>and <strong>Concord Engineers </strong>case, two different Division Benches of the High Court Division have only confirmed this position of law, though without saying anything as regards the said proviso to Clause-(iii) of Section 29 (1). However, in giving interpretation to a relevant provision, the proviso, if any thereto, should also be interpreted. At least it should be said that the proviso is not relevant for deciding the case concerned.<br/> <br/>In reaching above conclusion, we have also considered the decision of this Court in <strong>Carew &amp; Co. Case (20 DLR-318)</strong>. In that case though a similar provision, namely Section 10(2) (Clause-iii) of the then Income Tax Act, 1922, was interpreted, the same was done in response to a different set of questions as framed by the Pakistan Supreme Court. Again, though the facts involving the question no.1 in that income tax reference case are similar to our present facts, yet the question was whether the Darshana branch of the assessee Company could be regarded as an agent of the non-resident payee of the interest on the over-draft account from which accommodation was given to the said Darshana branch from Dhaka branch of the then Imperial Bank of India (State Bank of India). Therefore, the main issue was whether the Darshana branch of the assessee Carew and Co. could be regarded as an agent of the non-resident payee (State Bank of India) of the interest paid by the assessee within the purview of Section 43.<br/> <br/>Thus, the question no. 1 and the context in that reference case were totally different. Further, question no.2 was relating to the allowance of interest paid by the asessee on the loan availed through issuance of debentures held in Calcutta. This question and the context on which the same was decided were also different from the facts and circumstances of the cases before us in that the concerned taxable territory was Pakistan and the debentures issued to borrow money was in Calcutta. On the other hand, though it was held by the Court in answering the said second question that the capital borrowed must be a capital which was utilized for the purpose of the business of the assessee (see para-14, p-321), yet it is evident that the proviso to Clause-(iii) of sub-section (2) of Section 10 of the then Income Tax Act, 1922 was totally different from the proviso in question to Clause-(iii) of Section 29(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1984.

Abu Tariq, J: </u></strong><br/> <br/>This appeal is directed against the judgment and decree dated 31.08.1998 dismissing the suit passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, Patiya, Chittagong, in Other Class Suit No. 05 of 1997.<br/><br/>The plaintiff-appellant instituted a suit for specific performance of contract alleging, inter-alia, that the respondent No. 1 proposed to sell the land in question and the plaintiff agreed to purchase the same. On agreement, settled that the value of the land would be Tk. 1,60,000/-, out of which the plaintiff paid Tk. 1,30,000/- and signed the bainama on condition that the respondent No. 1 would execute the registered deed in respect of the suit land to the plaintiff as per contract. Thereafter, the plaintiff by giving rest amount to the plaintiff requested the defendant respondent No. 1 to register the sell deed in favour of plaintiff-appellant but the defendant refused to execute and register the deed. Hence, the suit.<br/><br/>The defendant No. 1 contested the suit by filing written statement denying the material allegations made in the plaint and contended that there was no cause of action and no recital in the plaint about the offer and acceptance of the contract. He denied the contract for sale of the suit land between the defendant No. 1 and the plaintiff.<br/><br/>After hearing of both the parties, the learned Judge of the trial Court dismissed the suit on the ground that the suit is barred by limitation.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment of the trial Court, the plaintiff filed this appeal.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Khandoaker Saiful Hoque appearing on behalf of the appellant submits that though the defendant No. 1 denied to have the deed of agreement executed on 01.01.1993 (Exhibit-1) but the plaintiff was able to prove the agreement and the trial Court also found that:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“নালিশী সম্পত্তি খরিদ বিএ্রির বিষয়ে বাদী ও ১ নং বিবাদীর সাথে চুও্রি হয়েছে এবং ণ`ৎনঞ্চৈৎহ ১/২/১৯৯৩ তারিখে বায়নার টাকা গ্রহণ করে ১ নং বিবাদী তর্কিত বায়না পত্রটি (প্রদর্শনী-১) সম্পাদন করেছেন”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The trial Court thus without considering the vital point erroneously held that the suit was barred by limitation and illegally dismissed the suit as such decision of trial Court is contrary to law which is liable to be interfered with by this Court.<br/><br/>He further submits that as per the admission of the defendant No. 1 and on the basis of materials on record it was proved by the plaintiff and found by the trial Court that contract was singed on 01.02.1993 and was delayed up to 15.08.1996 and then the suit was filed on 12.02.1997 when executant refused to execute the contract. The trial Court ought to have held that the suit was within three years of refusal to execute and register the deed in view of second part of Article 113 of the Limitation Act. The leaned Subordinate Judge dismissed the suit illegally as barred by limitation as such the decision is not in according to law.  He prayed for allowing the appeal and set aside the judgment and decree of the trial Court.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Fakaruddin appearing on behalf of the respondent submits that the suit was out of time and the plaintiff hopelessly failed to prove his case and as such the learned Judge of the trial Court rightly passed by the impugned judgment, dismissing the suit and there is no scope to interfere with the same. He prayed for dismissal of the appeal.<br/><br/>I have heard the learned Advocate of both the parties, perused the impugned judgment and other materials on record.<br/><br/>It appears that defendant No. 1 admitted that he received the alleged money which not relates to the purpose of agreement for sale but for other purpose. It was not fact to which he referred as being the subject matter of the contract. The contention of the defendant is that the plaintiff is not entitled to specific performance of contract though the agreement was a genuine one.<br/><br/>The question, therefore, is whether in this case the plaintiff is entitled to get decree for specific performance of contract on the facts proved. The answer is below as found by the trial Court:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"উপরোও্র আলোচনা, উভয়পক্ষের স্বাক্ষ্যে বিশদভাবে পর্যালোচনা ১ নং বিবাদীর আচরন ও পারিপার্শ্বিকতা বিবেচনায় আমি এই সিহর সিদ্ধা উপনীত হয়েছি যে, নালিশী সম্পত্তি খরিদ বিএ্রির বিষয়ে বাদী ও ১ নং বিবাদীর সাথে চুও্রি হয়েছে এবং তদাবসহায় ১/২/১৯৯৩ ইং তারিখে বায়নার টাকা গ্রহণ করে ১ নং বিবাদী তর্কিত বায়না পত্রটি (প্রঃ-১) সম্পাদন করেছেন "</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In view of such findings based on material on record and evidence, the plaintiff is entitled to get a decree for specific performance of contract. Thus this Court is of the view that the plaintiff’s claim for specific performance of contract is liable to be allowed. This view find substance which has been held in the case of Jahanara Begum –versus- Md. Aminul Islam Chowdhury reported in 2 MLR (AD) 215 that:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“In a suit for specific performance to contract the primary requirement is that the plaintiff must prove the genuineness of the agreement with cogent and reliable evidence.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It appears that the trial Court having found that the plaintiff is entitled to get a decree as prayed for but the suit is barred by provision of Article 113 of the Limitation Act and dismissed the suit findings that the plaintiff proved the genuineness of the agreement with cogent reliable evidences but suit is time barred finding that:- “১ নং বিবাদী কবালা সম্পাদন করে দিতে বাধ্য নন কেননা টাকা যাচনা করার মেয়াদ ১/১/১৯৯৬ ইং তারিখে উত্তির্ন হয়েছে”<br/><br/>Article 13 of the Limitation Act provides that:-</div><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 96px;"><strong>Description of suit</strong></td><td style="width: 82px;"><strong>Period of Limitation</strong></td><td style="width: 105px;"><strong>Time from which period begins to run</strong></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 96px;"><strong>113</strong>. For specific performance of a contract.</td><td style="width: 82px;">[Three years]<br/>			 <br/>			 </td><td style="width: 105px;">The date fixed for the performance, or, if no such date is fixed, when the plaintiff has notice that performance is refused.</td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It is the settled principle of law as provided in Article 113 of the Limitation Act that the cause of action for a suit for specific performance of a contract arises when the executant of agreement for sale refuses to act in accordance with the terms of the said agreement. The period of limitation for suit for specific performance of a contract is three years from the date of refusal. In the present case refusal was admittedly on 31.12.1996 and suit was filed on 12.02.1997 and is within the time provided in law. Thus suit being filed on 12.02.1997 due to refusal on 31.12.1996, that is, well within three years from the aforesaid date of refusal as provided under Article 113 of Limitation Act, deals within the provision for filing suit for specific performance of contract.<br/><br/>In the instant case, there is no dispute that time is the essence of the contract and the further finding is that balance consideration was tendered within the time but the defendant delayed the matter and ultimately refused to accept the same and refused to execute the deed. The defendant committed an act of indiscretion and foul play which was also proved.<br/><br/>A suit for specific performance of contract for sale of property is undoubtedly covered by Article 113 of the Limitation Act and limitation runs from the date of refusal to perform the obligation on his part of contract. Therefore, in any view of the matter, the suit is not barred by limitation.<br/><br/>Therefore, the suit is nothing but a suit for specific performance of contract and there is no scope to entertain any doubt about it. Thus I find substance in the argument made by the learned Advocate for the appellant.<br/><br/>In the instant case, the trail Court misconstrued the material document and misread the materials on record as the suit was not barred by limitation and thus the trial Court committed illegality and material irregularity in dismissing the suit. As the plaintiff was able to prove the case is entitled for a decree.<br/><br/>In view of the above facts and circumstance of the case, I find merit in this appeal.<br/><br/><strong>ED.</strong></div></div></div>

He paid taxes of an amount of Tk. 2,67,498/-on his income for the assessment year 2011-2012. The said return was accepted by the DCT under sub-section (1) of section 82BB of the Ordinance. The return has not been selected for audit under sub-section (3) of section 82BB of the Ordinance by the National Board of Revenue (hereinafter stated as NBR). After about a period of two years, the Inspecting Additional Commissioner of Taxes, Range-2, Taxes Zone-4, Chittagong (shortly stated as the IACT) issued the impugned notice under Nathi No. পরে-১(৩২)/কঅ-৪(চট্ট)/১২০ধারা/২০১৩-২০১৪/২৭৮ dated 26.11.2013 purporting to take action under section 120 of the Ordinance by treating the return as an assessment order passed by the DCT on total misconception of law of universal self-assessment scheme under section 82BB of the Ordinance enacted by the Parliament.<br/> <br/>The petitioner also filed a supplem-entary affidavit stating that the IACT issued another notice under Nathi No. পরে-১(৩২)/কঅ-৪(চট্ট)/১২০ধারা/২০১৩-২০১৪/ ২৯৪ dated 12.12.2013 correcting letter dated 12.12.2013; that the petitioner submitted written objection as to the jurisdiction; that respondent No. 3 then issued letter dated 15.01.2014; that respondent No. 3 ignoring his jurisdiction in the matter of universal self-assessment scheme under section 82BB of the Ordinance, passed order dated 02.02.2015 under section 120 of the Ordinance illegally. Eventually, respondent No. 4, the DCT passed an assessment order under sections 82BB (1)/120 of the<br/>Ordinance on 04.02.2014 as per direction of the IACT.<br/> <br/>In the backdrop of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the petitioner filed this writ petition and obtained the Rule with an order of stay of operation of the notice demanding taxes.<br/> <br/>Respondent No. 2, the Commissioner of Taxes, contested the writ petition by filing an affidavit-in-opposition supporting the impugned notices issued by the IACT contending, inter-alia, that non-selection of a return for audit does not mean that other provisions of the Ordinance will not be applicable, if necessary; that, in the instant case, the IACT correctly initiated proceedings under section 120 of the Ordinance in the interest of the revenue for which he is empowered and entrusted; that the IACT rightly issued notice under Memo No. পরে-১(৩২)/কঅ-৪(চট্ট)/১২০ধারা/২০১৩-২০১৪/২৭৮ dated 26.11.2013 invoking power as contemplated in section 120 of the Ordinance; that the petitioner filed the return under section 82BB (universal self-assessment scheme) of the Ordinance and the DCT issued a receipt of the said return and the said receipt is deemed to be an order of assessment by the DCT for the assessment year 2011-2012; that the petitioner himself admits it in paragraph 4 of the writ petition; that the IACT examined the record and considered that the order passed by the DCT under section 82BB(1) of the Ordinance is erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to the interest of revenue and stating detailed reasons he issued impugned notice No. পরে-১(৩২)/কঅ-৪(চট্ট)/১২০ধারা/২০১৩-২০১৪/২৭৮ dated 26.11.2013 for giving the petitioner an opportunity of being heard; that issuance of the said notice is quite justified and within the purview of the provision of section 120 of the Ordinance; that the receipt of a return submitted under section 82BB of the Ordinance, is an assessment order of the DCT; that the petitioner in response to the notice under section 120 of the Ordinance and corrigendum thereof for an inadvertent mistake with regard to a date submitted a reply along with oral representation through his legal representative on 29.12.2013 seeking the abeyance of the proceedings initiated under section 120 of the Ordinance; that the petitioner deliberately suppressed the relevant facts necessary for deciding the dispute; that the order under section 120 of the Ordinance had already been passed before filing the writ petition; that the petitioner has ample opportunity to go for appeal, if he is dissatisfied with the order. So, the question of irreparable loss does not arise at all; that the instant writ petition is frivolous, vexatious, without merit and with malafide intention to avoid payment of Government revenue and, as such, the Rule is liable to be discharged.<br/> <br/>Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali, the learned Advocate for the assessee-petitioner, takes us through the writ petition, the supplementary affidavit thereto, the connected materials on record as well as the provisions of sections 82BB and 120 of the Ordinance and forwards before us the following arguments:-</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">a return submitted under section 82BB of the Ordinance under universal self-assessment scheme and accepted by the DCT under sub-section (1) may only be selected for audit by NBR under sub­section (3) of the said section of the Ordinance. Hence, the issuance of notices under section 120 by treating the self-assessment under section 82BB of the Ordinance to be an order of assessment passed by the DCT is without jurisdiction;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">under section 120 of the Ordinance, the IACT has only jurisdiction to interfere with the assessment order, if there has been any error of law. But, he cannot invoke his jurisdiction under section 120 of the Ordinance in case of any error of facts;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">in the instant case, from the impugned notices, it is evident that the IACT only pointed out some error of facts and not any error of law resulting in loss of Government revenue. Therefore, the IACT had no jurisdiction to modify the assessment order or direct the DCT to revise the same under section 120 of the Ordinance and impugned notices and subsequent proceeding are illegal and liable to be struck down.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In reply, Mr. S. Rashed Jahangir, the learned Deputy Attorney General, appearing with Mr. Titus Hillol Rema and Ms. Salma Rahman, the learned Assistant Attorney Generals, on behalf of the respondents, takes us through the affidavit-in-opposition, the provisions of sections 82BB and 120 of the Ordinance and contends as follows:-</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;">there is no provision in the four corners of the Ordinance that a return submitted under section 82BB shall remain outside the ambit of section 120 of the Ordinance. Therefore, the IACT has jurisdiction to pass an order under section 120 of the Ordinance;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">under section 82BB of the Ordinance, the DCT has jurisdiction to receive a return or cause to be received by any other official authorized by him and issue a receipt of such return only where an  assessee furnishes a correct and complete return of income. In case, an assessee furnishes a correct and complete return of income, in such case, the DCT is to issue a receipt of such return and the said receipt shall be deemed to be an assessment for the assessment year for which the return is filed;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">in the instant case, the assessee submitted a return which was incorrect and incomplete and, as such, the acceptance of the return by the DCT under section 82BB of the Ordinance was beyond his jurisdiction and therefore, the IACT legally invoked his jurisdiction under section 120 of the Ordinance, as the DCT committed an error of law in accepting an incorrect and incomplete return erroneously and it was prejudicial to the interest of the Government revenue. Therefore, the impugned notices issued by the IACT under section 120 of the Ordinance are lawful and the Rule is, thus, liable to be discharged.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> In view of the submissions as advanced by the learned Advocates/the learned Deputy Attorney General for the contending parties, the sole question to be decided in the Rule is the legality of the notices issued by the IACT under section 120 of the Ordinance.<br/> <br/>We have examined the writ petition, the supplementary affidavit thereto, the affidavit-in-opposition and the connected materials on record. We have also carefully examined the relevant provisions of sections 82BB and 120 of the Ordinance to the best of our ability.<br/> <br/>It is an admitted proposition that the assessee-petitioner filed his return of income for the assessment year 2011-2012 under universal self-assessment scheme under section 82BB of the Ordinance. It is also admitted that the DCT accepted the said return and issued acknowledgement receipt accordingly. Admittedly, NBR has not selected the return for audit under section 82BB(3) of the Ordinance. There is no dispute that the IACT, subsequently, issued the impugned notices by invoking his jurisdiction under section 120 of the Ordinance.

Universal self Assessment.— </strong><br/>Subject to sub-section (3), where an assessee, either manually or electronically, furnishes a correct and complete return of income, the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes shall receive such return himself or cause to be received by any other official authorized by him and issue a receipt of such return normally or electronically and the said receipt shall be deemed to be an order of assessment for the assessment year for which the return is filed.<br/>A return shall be taken to be complete, if it is filed in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (2) or (3) of section 75 and tax has been paid in accordance with section 74.<br/>Notwithstanding anything contained in sub­ section (1), the Board or any authority subordinate to the Board, if so authorized by the Board in this behalf, may select, in the manner to be determined by the Board, a number of these returns filed under sub­ section (1) and refer the returns so selected to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes for the purpose of audit and the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes shall thereupon proceed, if so required, to make the assessment under section 83 or section 84, as the case may be.<br/>Provided that a return of income filed under this section shall not be selected for audit where such return shows at least twenty percent higher income than the income assessed or shown in the return of the immediate preceding assessment year and—<br/>does not have any income which is exempted from tax; or<br/>does not have receipt of Gift; or (c) does not have loan other than from a bank or financial institution; or<br/>sum of ascertain of next wealth and shown expenditure is covered by the income.<br/>No question as to the source of investment made by a new assessee deriving income from business or profession shall be raised, if he shows income at least not less than twenty five percent of the capital invested in business or profession and pays tax on such income before filing of income.<br/>The initial capital investment of business or profession or any fraction of such initial capital shall not be transferred from that business or profession within the income year when the investment was made or within five years from the end of that income year.”<br/>(Bold, emphasis given)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Section 120 of the Ordinance reads as under:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“120.   <strong>Power of Inspecting Joint Commissioner to revise orders of Deputy Commissioner of Taxes.— </strong><br/>The Inspecting Joint Commissioner may call for from the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes and examine the record of any proceeding under this Ordinance, and, <strong>if he considers that any order passed therein by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes is erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to the interests of the revenue, </strong>he may, after giving the assessee an opportunity of being heard, and after making or causing to be made, such inquiry as he thinks necessary, pass such order thereon as in his view the circumstances of the case would justify, including an order enhancing or modifying the assessment or canceling the assessment and directing a fresh assessment to be made.<br/>No order shall be made under sub-section (1) after the expiry of four years from the date of the order sought to be revised.” (Bold, emphasis supplied)<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">On careful scrutiny of the aforesaid two sections, it is evident that the DCT, before accepting a return of income, has to <strong>satisfy himself about the correctness and comple-teness of such return </strong>and if he is satisfied about the correctness and completeness of a return, in such case, only he or his authorized other official has to receive such return and issue a receipt and when such receipt is issued by the DCT, in such case, only it is to be treated as an assessment. Mere filing of an assessment under self-assessment scheme is not an assessment in the eye of law, unless it is accepted by the DCT or his authorized other official and receipt is issued on such return being satisfied about the correctness and completeness of the return. Therefore, it cannot be said that the acceptance of the return on examination of correctness and completeness is not an order passed by the DCT.<br/> <br/>Under section 120 of the Ordinance, the IACT is empowered to call for the record of any proceeding from the DCT and examine the same under section 120 of the Ordinance and if he considers that <strong>any order </strong>passed thereon by the DCT is erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to the interest of the Government revenue, he may invoke his jurisdiction under section 120 of the Ordinance subject to certain conditions.<br/> <br/>In the instant case, where the DCT is accepting a return and issuing a receipt which is being treated as an assessment, no doubt, the DCT is passing an order about the correctness and completeness of the return. Therefore, it cannot be said that the IACT has no jurisdiction to pass any order under section 120 of the Ordinance.<br/> <br/>Be that as it may, if the DCT has committed an error of law, the IACT on examination of the record of the DCT, may pass order following the provision of section 120 of the Ordinance. However,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">.0<br/>+</div><div style="text-align: justify;">by now it is a settled principle of law that the IACT may invoke his jurisdiction under section 120 of the Ordinance only where the order passed by the DCT is erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to the interest of the Government revenue and the error of the DCT must be an error of law and not an error on facts. In the instant case, we have already seen from Annexure-B to the writ petition that the notice issued by the IACT is on factual error. The learned Deputy Attorney General submits that the return was incorrect and incomplete, but the DCT violating the provision of section 82BB(1) of the Ordinance accepted it. But, from the impugned notices issued by the IACT, it transpires that the IACT has not mentioned therein that the DCT committed an error of law in accepting an incorrect and incomplete return.<br/><br/>Thus, we find no substance in the argument of Mr. S. Rashed Jahangir, the learned Deputy Attorney General, that the order passed by the IACT is on legal error committed by the DCT. So, it cannot be said that the DCT committed any error of law so as to invoke jurisdiction under section 120 of the Ordinance by the IACT. Therefore, the impugned notices and subsequent proceedings and order passed/issued by the IACT cannot be said to be lawful.<br/><br/>In view of the above, we find merit and force in the arguments of Mr. Sarder Jinnat Ali and we find no merit in the arguments of Mr. S. Rashed Jahangir.<br/><br/>In view of the discussions made in the foregoing paragraphs, vis-à-vis the law, we find merit in this Rule. Accordingly, the Rule is made absolute.<br/><br/>The impugned notices under Memo No. পরে-১(৩২)/কঅ-৪(চট্ট)/১২০ধারা/২০১৩-২০১৪/২৭৮ dated 26.11.2013 (Annexure-B to the writ petition) and পরে-১(৩২)/কঅ-৪(চট্ট)/১২০ধারা/২০১৩-২০১৪/২৯৪ dated 12.12.2013 (Annexure-C to the supplementary affidavit) issued by respondent No. 3 and all the subsequent actions under section 120 of the Ordinance are, hereby, declared to have been issued/taken without lawful authority and are of no legal effect.<br/><br/>No costs.<br/><br/>Communicate the judgment to respondents No. 3 and 4 at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

No.88 of 2011 correspondence to Gulshan Police Station Case No.45 dated 16.08.2011 taking cognizance against the accused-petitioner under section 13 of the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain,2002.   <br/> <br/>The facts, leading to the filing of this criminal petition for leave to appeal, in a nutshell, are:<br/>      The prosecution case, in brief, is that accused Md. Hafiz Ibrahim was an influential parliament member elected from Bhola-2 constituency in 8<sup>th</sup> National Parliament. He was  also a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee of Ministry of Planning and Ministry of Information. Accused Md. Hafiz Ibrahim and his wife, the present accused-petitioners on 19.12.2005 in their joint names had opened a bank account in Standard Chartered Bank’s Battery Road Branch, Singapore being USD Account No.01-07-416270. On an enquiry, the Anti-Corruption Commission found that U.D.$ 1,75,000/- was transferred between 19.12.2005 to 16.01.2008 in their joint bank account in Singapore from the joint account of Julfikar Ali, who was then a consultant of Siemins Bangladesh Ltd. and his wife Rahima Ali. It was also revealed from the documents that the aforesaid U.S.$ was transferred to the account of the accused as a bribe to Hafiz Ibrahim for conduction of lobbing and helping Siemins to get a tender invited by the BTCL. Siemins admitted the said fact of giving money to many persons in Bangladesh in a criminal case, conducted in the District Court of Columbia, U.S.A. Accused Hafiz Ibrahim did not disclose anything about the said money in his wealth statement submitted before the Commission. Therefore, the accused persons committed an offence of Money Laundering.<br/><br/>On the basis of the FIR, Gulshan Police Station Case No.45 dated 16.08.2011 under sections 2 (ট) (আ) and 4(2) of the Money Laundering Protirodh Ordinance,2008 read with Money Laundering Protirodh Ain,2009 was started. <br/>The investigation officer after completing investigation and obtaining sanction from the Commission, submitted charge sheet under section 13 of the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2002 read with section 4(2) of the Money Laundering Ain, 2009 against the accused-petitioner along with her husband.<br/><br/>After that, the case record was transferred to the Court of Metropolitan Senior Special Judge, Dhaka, and registered as Metropolitan Special Case No.138 of 2012. On 04.09.2012, the accused-petitioner filed an application for not taking cognizance against her. The learned Metropolitan Special Judge, Dhaka after hearing the respective parties by the order dated 04.09.2012 rejected the said application and had taken cognizance against the accused-petitioner and another under section 13 of the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2002.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the said order of taking cognizance in the case, the accused-petitioner preferred a revisional application being Criminal Revision No.357 of 2013 before the High Court Division. Earlier, the matter was heard by a Division Bench of the High Court Division. But because of conflicting views of the learned Judges on the point of law with regard to issuance of the Rule, the matter was placed before the learned Chief Justice of Bangladesh for necessary order. The learned Chief Justice was pleased to send the matter before a Third Judge, namely, Mr. Justice Enayatur Rahim for hearing, who upon hearing this application by the order dated 20.02.2014 summarily rejected the application. <br/><br/>Feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division, the leave petitioner has preferred this criminal petition for leave to appeal before this Division.<br/>Mr. T. H. Khan, learned Senior Advocate (Mr. A. M. Mahbub Uddin, Advocate appearing with him), appearing on behalf of the leave petitioner, submits that the learned Third Judge in his judgment observed that on perusal of the FIR and the charge sheet, it appeared that the money was transferred from the joint account of Julfikar Ali and his wife Rahima Ali to the account of present petitioner and her husband accused Hafiz Ibrahim in Singapore for illegal purpose but the said Julfikar Ali and his wife were not made accused in the present case that even after the observation of the High Court Division, the Anti-Corruption Commissioner did not make them accused in the case and as such, for violation of the observation of this Court, the entire proceeding should be quashed. He further submits that the High Court Division failed to appreciate that on the self-same offence, the continuation of one proceeding against the certain accused keeping in abeyance another part of the proceeding against other accused for investigation is violation of section 239 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and as such, the impugned judgment should be set aside.<br/><br/>Mr. Mahbubey Alam, learned Attorney General, appearing on behalf of respondent No.1, also supports the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court Division.<br/><br/>Mr. Khorshid Alam Khan, learned Advocate, appearing on behalf of respondent No.2, on the other hand, supports the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court Division. <br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the Senior Advocate for the leave-petitioner and the learned Attorney General for respondent No.1 and Mr. Khorshid Alam Khan, learned Advocate for respondent No.2, perused the impugned judgment and the materials on record.<br/><br/>Having considered a few reported and unreported cases of this Division, the High Court Division found that there was no scope to hold that sanction of the Government was mandatory to make inquiry of the offence of the present case as per provision of section 188 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. On consideration of the relevant provision of law, the High Court Division came to a finding that section 188 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was not applicable to this particular case and rather it was inconsistent with the provision of sections 20(1) and 32 of the Anti-Corruption Act, 2004 and section 4(4) and 6(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act,1958.<br/><br/>While rejecting the application under section 10(1)(A) of Criminal Law Amendment Act,1958, the High Court Division made the following observation and direction:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“However, on perusal of the First Information Report and the charge sheet, it appears that the alleged money was transferred from the joint account of Mr. Julfikar Ali and his wife Rahima Ali to the account of the present accused petitioner and her husband, accused Md. Hafiz Ibrahim in Singapore for illegal purchase but said Mr. Julfikar Ali and his wife were not made accused in the case, though Julfiker Ali has been cited as a witness in the charge sheet.<br/>It is surprising to me that why said Julfikar Ali and his wife were not made accused in the case.<br/>From the materials on record, prima facie it seems to me that they also committed offence of money laundering as defined in section 2(W) (A) (B) of the Money Laundering Portirodh Ain, 2002.<br/>Thus, I am inclined to direct the Anti-Corruption Commission to look into the matter and to take appropriate steps in accordance with the law.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The learned Special Judge, Special Court No.3, by order No.40 dated 30.04.2014 communicated the judgment and order of the High Court Division to the trial Court as well the Anti-Corruption Commission. Even after receipt of the judgment and order of the High Court Division, the Assistant Director, Anti-Corruption Commission issued a memo dated 11.09.2014. According to that memo if Julfikar Ali had been made an accused, there would be no witness to produce and prove any document in Court. Since there was no other option, Julfikar Ali was made a witness.<br/><br/>The aforesaid views expressed in the memo are objectionable and derogatory to the observation and direction made by the High Court Division. It is not comprehensible of how the Anti-Corruption Commission took such a stand in respect of Julfikar Ali.<br/><br/>Having considered all aspects of the case, we direct the Special Judge to treat Julfikar Ali and his  wife Rahima Ali as accused in the case and to take cognizance against them under the relevant provisions of law and thereafter to proceed with the case in accordance with law.<br/><br/>We, however, do not find any illegality in the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court Division. Therefore, this criminal petition for leave to appeal is disposed of with the direction made in the body of the judgment.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Ashraful Kamal, J:</u></strong><br/><br/>Appellants Md. Duhku Mia and Md. Billal Hossain have preferred Jail Appeal No. 229 of 2008 and Jail Appeal No. 230 of 2008 respectively against the judgment and order dated 8<sup>th</sup> January, 2008 passed by the Sessions Judge, Jamalpur in Sessions Case No. 315 of 2007 convicting them under section 19 (1) and 1(Ka) of the Narcotics Control Act, 1990 and sentencing them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 2 (two) years and also to pay a fine of Tk. 200/- each in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 2(two) days more.<br/><br/>Brief facts, necessary for the disposal of the appeals are as follows;<br/>On 19.11.2007 at about 13:25 hours Mukul Datta (Const. 545), D.B. Jamalpur lodged a First Information Report alleging, <em>inter alia</em> that on 19.11.2007 the informant along with const. Md. Shafiqul Islam, Md. Bazlur Rahman were on a  special operation in Jamalpur Pourashava Area. Then, they received a secret information that there was a trading of heroin in the area of Getpar Fishery Area under the Jamalpur Pourashava. Immediately they rushed to the place of occurrence and at about 11:45 hours they reached there. They caught accused Md. Dukhu Mia and Md. Billal Hossain red handed with heroin. Then police inspector Md. Enamul Haque came to the place of occurrence. Then, he searched the appellants and found 3 (three) puria of heroin from the pocket of the appellant Dukhu Mia and 2 (two) puria of heroin from the pocket of the appellant Billal Hossain. Thereafter, he prepared a seizure list in presence of the witnesses and also took their signatures therein.<br/><br/>After conclusion of the investigation, the police submitted a charge sheet against the appellants under section 19 (1) and 1(Ka) of the Narcotics Control Act, 1990 (as amended 2004) on 30.11.2007.<br/><br/>On 31.12.2007, the case record was transmitted to the Sessions Judge, Jamalpur for disposal, who on the same day took cognigence of the offence against the appellants under aforesaid provisions of the law. <br/><br/>On 08.01.2008 both the appellants confessed the offence before the court. The Sessions Judge, Jamalpur on the basis of their plea of guilty convicted them under section 19(1) and 1 (Ka) of the Narcotics Control Act, 1990 and sentenced them as above.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the impugned Judgment and order dated 8<sup>th</sup> January, 2008 both the appellants preferred the above Jail appeals. <br/><br/>A Division Bench of this court on 18.03.2008 admitted those appeals presented under section 420 of the Code of Criminal procedure and called for the records and also issued usual notices.<br/><br/>On 12.04.2011 of the concerned section having received the lower court records and made the appeals ready for hearing.<br/><br/>We have gone through the First Information Report, seizurelist, chemical examination report, charge sheet and the judgment and order dated 8<sup>th</sup> January, 2008.<br/><br/>The core question, before this court is whether a convicted person who was convicted on the basis of a plea of guilty has any right to appeal.<br/><br/>Section 412 of the Code of Criminal procedure runs as follows:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Notwithstanding anything hereinbefore where an accused person has pleaded guilty and has been convicted by a Court of Sessions or any Metropolitan Magistrate or Magistrate the first class on such plea, there shall be no appeal except as to the extent or legality of the sentence.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From section 412 of the Code of Criminal procedure, it appears that when a accused if plead guilty and is convicted on such plea is considered to have waived his right to appeal. He can challenge only as to the extent or legality of the sentence. The right to appeal for a convicted person would stand forfeited if the court accept the plea of guilty and convict him on such plea.<br/><br/>Essence of the section 412 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is that a plea of guilty by an accused person is tantamount to an waiver to his right to appeal against the conviction.<br/><br/>In the present case both the appellant had pleaded guilty in the commission of offence under section 19 (1) and 1 (Ka) of the Narcotics Control Act, 1990 and  the Sessions Judge, Jamalpur has also accepted their plea of guilty and accordingly convicted them on such plea. Therefore, appellants have no right to present any appeal against the impugned judgment and order of conviction. In view of the said discussion and provision of law we are of opinion that this appeals should be dismissed.  <br/><br/>In the result, the both the Jail Appeals are dismissed. The impugned judgment and order dated 8<sup>th</sup> January, 2008 passed by the Sessions Judge, Jamalpur in Sessions Case No. 315 of 2007 convicting the appellants under section 19(1) and 1 (Ka) of the Narcotics Control Act, 1990 are hereby confirmed.<br/><br/>Communicate this order at once and send down the lower court records.  <br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

The plaintiffs also prayed for another declaration that the registered deed No. 13723 dated 08.01.2005 is illegal, null and void and executed it by practicing fraud upon the court.<br/><br/>The petitioner as defendant entered appearance in the said suit and filed an application for rejection of plaint under order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/><br/>The case of the defendant petitioner is that the plaintiff  opposite party as developer company, entered into an agreement for sale of the schedule flat in question with this petitioner and when the plaintiff opposite parties failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement for sale, the petitioner, being instituted Title Suit No. 114 of 2002 before the 1<sup>st</sup> Court of Joint District Judge, Dhaka for specific performance of contract against the defendants- opposite parties and they contested the said suit by filing  written statement and the suit was decreed on contest  on 10.2.2005 against the opposite parties. Then the petitioner got the deed No. 13723 dated 8.1.2005 registered and also got delivery of possession through court in Title Execution Case No.5 of 2005.<br/><br/>Then the opposite parties preferred First Appeal Tender No. 704 of 2006 against the said judgment and decree dated 10.2.205 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Dhaka before this Court with an application for condonation of delay of 553 days and the Rule was issued in Civil Rule No. 890(F) of 2006 and was discharged by an order dated 5.12.2007. Then the opposite parties moved before the Appellate Division by filing Civil Miscellaneous Petition No. 38 of 2008 against the said judgment and order dated 5.12.2007 passed by this Court. Ultimately the said Civil Miscellaneous Petition No. 38 of 2008 was dismissed for non compliance of the order of the Appellate Division dated 18.1.2009.<br/><br/>Mr. M. Amir-Ul-Islam, the learned Senior Advocate appearing with Mr. Md. Toslim Uddin and Mr. Md. Rafiqul Islam, the learned Advocates on behalf of the defendant petitioner submits that there is no cause of action for filing the suit against the defendant petitioner rather the suit was filed in order to frustrate the judgment and decree passed in Title Suit No.78 of 2004 against this opposite parties and the instant suit is an abuse of the process of the court.<br/><br/>Mr. Islam, the learned Advocate submits further that the suit is hit by section 42 of the Specific Relief Act as the plaintiffs-opposite parties having no legal character or any right as to the property in question but the learned Joint District Judge without considering the provision of Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure rejected such application of the petitioner.<br/><br/>Mr. Islam, the learned Advocate finally submits that the deed in question being No. 13723 dated 8.1.2005 was executed and registered through court in pursuance of the judgment and decree dated 10.2.2005 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Dhaka and ultimately such decree was affirmed by the Appellate Division in the earlier suit so question of fraud as alleged upon the parties or the court does not at all arise and thus the Rule should be made absolute.<br/><br/>In support of his submission  Mr. Islam, the learned Advocate for the  petitioner has relied upon a decision of a case Rasheda Begum vs.- M.M.Nurussafa and others reported in 24 BLD(AD) 223.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Mr.Abdul Barek Chowdhury, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the plaintiff-opposite party No. 2 submits that whether the suit is maintainable or not would be decided only after taking evidence during the course of trial as such the impugned rejection order of the trial court should not be interfered with at this earliest stage.<br/><br/>Mr. Barek Chowdhury, the learned Advocate submits further that the deed in question was executed without prior permission of the Rajuk and without required payment of the transfer fees of the Rajuk and as such the deed is null and void.<br/><br/>But at one stage of the hearing Mr. Chowdhury, the learned Advocate candidly concedes that over the schedule flat in question the opposite parties were defeated up to the Appellate Division in a suit for specific performance of contract filed by the plaintiff-petitioner and thus there is hardly any scope to proceed with the present suit upon the self same matter against the petitioner.<br/><br/>We have heard the learned Advocates for both the parties, perused the impugned judgment and order, and gone through the referred decision wherefrom it transpires that the plaintiff opposite parties were defeated up to the Appellate Division in a suit for specific performance of contract filed by the petitioner over the schedule flat in question and the petitioner got registered deed and delivery of possession of the schedule flat through court.<br/><br/>The plaintiff opposites parties stated in the plaint that:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“উল্লেখ্য তর্কিত ৮/১/০৫ তারিখের ১৩৭২৩ নং দলিল রেজিস্ট্রির পুর্বে বা রেজিস্ট্রিকালে রাজউক এর বিত্ররয়/হসর পত্র অনুমোদন ও হস¹া¿¹র ফি জমা না দিয়া রেজিস্ট্রি করার কারনে বে-আইনী কাজ করা হইয়াছে সে কারনে তর্কিত দলিলটি বে-আইনী, তঞ্চকী, ভয়েড দলিল হইতেছে<br/>নালিশের কারণ: বিবাদীপক্ষ তার নামীয় তর্কিত গত ইং ৮/১/০৫ তারিখে ১৩৭২৩ নং সাফ কাবালা দলিলের দ্বারা উৎসাহিত হইয়া বাদী পক্ষের নিরংকুশ স্বত্ব দখলীয় তপছিল বর্নিত সম্পত্তি ও তদউপরস নালিশী এ্যাপার্টমেন্টের স্বত্ব দাবী করিয়া বেদখলের হুমকীর সময় বিকাল ইং ১২/২/২০০৮ ইং ১৪/২/২০০৮ ইং তারিখে বিবদীপক্ষের বিরুদ্ধে বাদী পক্ষের অত্র নালিশের কারণ উদ্ভব হইয়াছে”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It appears from the Annexure- E (a memo issued from Rajuk) that the defendant petitioner has paid the required transfer fees to the Rajuk about schedule flat in question. So the submission of the learned Advocate for the plaintiff opposite party about nonpayment of transfer fees of the Rajuk has got no substance. As such the suit does not disclose cause of action as required under order VII Rule 11 (a) of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/><br/>On perusal of the plaint it is the duty of the court to examine in order to ascertain whether any cause of action has been disclosed in the suit. But the trial court without considering the provision under order VII Rule 11 (a) of the Code rejected the application of the petitioner and thereby committed an error of law resulting in an error in the impugned decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/><br/>The decision in the case of Rasheda Begum vs. M.M Nurussafa and others reported in 24 BLD (AD) 223 as referred to by Mr. Islam, the learned Advocate, the Appellate Division held that:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“rejection of plaint is not confined to the provision of Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In an appropriate case while the proceeding itself is an abuse of the process of the court, the court having recourse of section 151 will be competent to reject the plaint.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>When the plaintiff opposite parties contested the earlier suit for specific performance of contract filed by the defendant petitioner and this petitioner got contesting decree thereof and also got registered deed as well as possession of the schedule flat in question through court and in such a situation the subsequent suit initiated by the plaintiffs opposite parties against the  defendant-petitioner over the self same flat in question seeking declaration that the deed is null and void should not be allowed to continue being an abuse of the process of the court.<br/><br/>Moreover when the ultimate result of the suit is as clear as day light, such a suit should be buried at its inception. So that no further time is consumed in fruitless  litigation.<br/><br/>For the discussion made above, we are constrained to hold that the court below committed an error of law resulting in an error occasioning failure of justice in passing the impugned order rejecting the application filed by the defendant petitioner under order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/><br/>In the result, the Rule is made absolute, however without any order as to costs.<br/><br/>The judgment and order dated 2.2.2009 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 7<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka in Title Suit No. 951 of 2008 is hereby set aside and consequently the application for rejection of plaint filed by the petitioner is allowed and thus the plaint of Title Suit No. 951 of 2008 of the Court of Joint District Judge, 7<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka is rejected under Order 7 Rule 11 (a) of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br/><br/>Send copy of this judgment to the learned Joint District Judge, 7<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
